    "one of eliashberg s foundational achievements is his pioneering work on the existence theory of stein manifolds .",
    "these manifolds have been studied by complex analysts for most of the past century , and so have many equivalent definitions .",
    "the definition that most immediately indicates their fundamental nature is that they are complex affine analytic varieties , i.e. , complex manifolds that embed holomorphically as closed subsets of @xmath4 .",
    "the importance of stein manifolds mandates the study of two basic existence questions .",
    "most obviously , we should ask which abstract smooth manifolds admit stein structures . however , we can also work inside a fixed ambient complex manifold @xmath5 .",
    "every open subset of @xmath5 is itself a complex manifold , so we can ask which open subsets of @xmath5 are stein .",
    "the study of such stein open subsets has had a long and continuing history , already in the special case @xmath6 .",
    "for example , if @xmath5 is @xmath7 ( or any other stein manifold ) , then its stein open subsets @xmath8 have been characterized as being _ domains of holomorphy _ , meaning that they satisfy a certain maximality condition for extending holomorphic functions .",
    "( specifically , for every connected , open @xmath9 extending outside of @xmath8 , and every component @xmath10 of @xmath11 , there are holomorphic functions on @xmath8 whose restriction to @xmath10 does not extend to @xmath12 . ) since the stein condition can be destroyed by a tiny perturbation of @xmath8 , we reformulate the ambient existence question to put it within reach of a topological answer : which open subsets of @xmath5 can be made stein by an _",
    "isotopy _ , i.e. , a homotopy of the inclusion map through embeddings ? ( we define embeddings to be 1 - 1 immersions , but do not require them to be proper , so we are asking when an open set can be deformed into a new open set whose complex structure inherited from @xmath5 is stein . )",
    "building on eliashberg s work of the late 1980s , we can now completely answer both the abstract and ambient existence questions . in complex dimension",
    "@xmath13 , eliashberg completely characterized those manifolds admitting stein structures by a simple differential topological condition .",
    "a similar statement can be obtained in the ambient setting . when @xmath3 , one obtains the corresponding characterizations by imposing additional delicate conditions .",
    "alternatively , one can eliminate these extra conditions by passing to the topological category , i.e. , working up to homeomorphism or up to isotopy through topological ( @xmath14 rather than @xmath15 ) embeddings , and invoking freedman theory . as an application , one obtains domains of holomorphy in @xmath16 realizing uncountably many diffeomorphism types of exotic @xmath17s .",
    "more generally , every domain of holomorphy in @xmath1 is topologically isotopic to uncountably many other diffeomorphism types of such domains ( all of which are homeomorphic ) .    this paper surveys published and pending literature to give a unified view across all dimensions of these consequences of eliashberg s work .",
    "the abstract and ambient results are presented in sections  [ abstract ] and [ ambient ] , respectively , and their proofs are sketched in section  [ proofs ] .",
    "section  [ onion ] reexamines the ambient theory from several other viewpoints , replacing isotopy by the sharper notion of ambient isotopy and discussing when embedded cw - complexes can be described ( after isotopy ) as nested intersections of stein open subsets . in the 4-dimensional topological",
    "setting , this frequently yields an uncountable neighborhood system realizing uncountably many exotic smooth structures .",
    "section  [ appendix ] is an appendix proving several lemmas that are useful in earlier sections .",
    "to motivate eliashberg s work , we first consider necessary conditions for the existence of a stein structure .",
    "since a stein manifold @xmath8 is complex , it comes endowed with an almost - complex structure , that is , its tangent bundle @xmath18 is a complex vector bundle .",
    "we capture this structure with the bundle automorphism @xmath19 of @xmath18 given by fiberwise multiplication by @xmath20 .",
    "if such an almost - complex structure @xmath19 comes from a complex structure , then it uniquely determines the latter .",
    "however , we usually consider almost - complex structures only up to homotopy . the homotopy classification of complex bundle structures on @xmath18 ( or on any real vector bundle ) is a standard problem in algebraic topology .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to refine our original abstract existence question by asking which almost - complex structures on a given manifold ( if any exist ) are homotopic to stein structures .",
    "in addition to having an almost - complex structure , a stein manifold @xmath8 satisfies another classical condition : it admits an exhausting morse function ( i.e. a smooth , proper map @xmath21 whose critical points are nondegenerate ) such that each critical point has index @xmath22 .",
    "( thus , @xmath8 has real dimension @xmath23 but the homotopy type of an @xmath2-complex . )",
    "surprisingly , eliashberg s theorem asserts that these necessary conditions are also sufficient .",
    "[ absn ] @xcite . for @xmath13 ,",
    "let @xmath8 be a @xmath23-manifold with an almost - complex structure @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath19 is homotopic to a stein structure if and only if @xmath8 admits an exhausting morse function whose critical points all have index @xmath24 .    in particular , @xmath8 admits a stein structure if and only if it admits an almost - complex structure and suitable morse function .",
    "the original proof appeared in @xcite , but a simpler and more expository version will be given in the book @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the latter version in section  [ proofs ] .",
    "it is sometimes useful to replace morse theory by the language of handlebodies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recall that a _ handle of index @xmath25 _ , or _ @xmath25-handle _",
    ", is a copy of @xmath26 attached to the boundary of an @xmath27-manifold along its attaching region @xmath28 . a ( topological or smooth ) _ handlebody _",
    "@xmath29 is a manifold built from the empty set by successively attaching handles ( necessarily beginning with a 0-handle ) . in the smooth case , we glue each handle by a smooth embedding of its attaching region , then smooth the resulting corners .",
    "( these corners occur along @xmath30 . by uniqueness of tubular neighborhoods",
    ", we can canonically identify a neighborhood of the corner locus with the product of @xmath30 with @xmath31 minus the open first quadrant , then smooth using the essentially unique smoothing of the last factor . )",
    "handlebodies are necessarily _ locally finite _ in the sense that only finitely many handles attach to a given handle .",
    "( attaching infinitely many handles to a compact boundary region would cause clustering destroying the manifold structure . )",
    "we also require handlebodies to be _ morse ordered _",
    ", so each @xmath25-handle attaches to a subhandlebody consisting of handles with index @xmath32 . for compact handlebodies ( i.e. those with finitely many handles ) , this costs no generality by a general position argument , but infinite handlebodies are restricted , e.g. requiring infinitely many 0-handles .",
    "we impose this constraint since the cores @xmath33 of the handles will then fit together inside the handlebody to give an embedded cw - complex @xmath34 .",
    "( note that a cw - complex is morse - ordered by definition and locally finite if it embeds in a manifold . ) if there are no @xmath27-handles , then @xmath35 is homeomorphic ( diffeomorphic in the smooth case ) to @xmath36 $ ] , realizing @xmath29 as the mapping cylinder of a map @xmath37 .    to relate morse functions with handlebodies ,",
    "suppose @xmath38 is a critical value of an exhausting morse function @xmath39 , corresponding to a unique critical point @xmath40 in @xmath41\\subset u$ ] .",
    "then @xmath42 $ ] is obtained from @xmath43 $ ] by adding a collar @xmath44 to the boundary and then attaching a handle with the same index as @xmath40 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if there are only finitely many critical points , we may then identify @xmath8 with the interior of a handlebody by collapsing out the intervening collars .",
    "in our situation , though , there may be infinitely many critical points ( although only finitely many in each @xmath45 $ ] since @xmath46 is proper ) .",
    "collapsing the collars may no longer yield a morse - ordered handlebody .",
    "one could remedy this by simply adding collars into the definition of a handlebody , but only at the expense of losing morse - ordering or local finiteness .",
    "this would complicate the statements of some of our theorems , and lose the natural cw cores and mapping cylinder structure .",
    "instead , we show in the appendix ( lemma  [ decomp ] ) that suitable subdivision allows us to identify @xmath8 with the interior of a handlebody , even if @xmath46 has infinitely many critical points , and the maximal index of the handles is that of the critical points of @xmath46 . applying this to theorem  [ absn ] , we conclude :    [ absn1 ] under the hypotheses of eliashberg s theorem , @xmath19 is homotopic to a stein structure if and only if @xmath8 is diffeomorphic to the interior of a handlebody whose handles all have index @xmath24 .",
    "as we will see in section  [ proofs ] , eliashberg constructs his stein structure from @xmath19 by induction on increasing critical values , or from the other viewpoint , by induction on handles .",
    "the induction step works in all cases except for 4-dimensional 2-handles , resulting in a proof for all @xmath47 . in the problematic case ,",
    "the induction step may or may not work , depending on the framing of the 2-handle , so the following theorem results for stein _ surfaces _",
    "( i.e. the @xmath3 case ) .",
    "[ abs2 ] ( eliashberg . ) an oriented 4-manifold admits a stein structure if and only if it is diffeomorphic to the interior of a handlebody whose handles all have index @xmath48 , and for which each 2-handle is attached along a legendrian knot ( in the standard contact structure on the relevant boundary 3-manifold ) with framing obtained from the contact framing by adding one left twist",
    ".    for terminology and additional explanation , see section  [ proofs ] .",
    "the main observation there is that each 2-handle is attached to a finite union of 0- and 1-handles , whose boundary @xmath49 admits essentially a unique tight contact structure , with respect to which we can define legendrian knots and contact framings . theorem  [ abs2 ] was essentially known to eliashberg when he wrote @xcite , but it was not contemporaneously published .",
    "we have sharpened it slightly , using the appendix ( lemma  [ steindec ] ) to write it in the context of morse - ordered handlebodies without collars .",
    "( this sharpening is what makes a concise statement possible when there are infinitely many handles . from the morse viewpoint ,",
    "one must build the stein structure on the possibly complicated manifold below the level of a new 2-handle before the framing condition makes sense . ) for further discussion and applications of the theorem , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "note that a handlebody with all indices @xmath50 has the homotopy type of a 2-complex , so if it is oriented , it automatically admits almost - complex structures ( respecting the given orientation ) .",
    "thus it suffices to hypothesize an orientation rather than an almost - complex structure . on the other hand , the almost - complex structure",
    "is completely determined by the legendrian link along which the 2-handles are attached ( see section  [ proofs ] ) . unlike in other dimensions , there are manifolds admitting stein structures realizing some , but not all , homotopy classes of almost - complex structures .",
    "( in fact , this occurs for every stein surface with @xmath51 , by the adjunction inequality from seiberg - witten theory @xcite . )",
    "we now have a complete characterization , in all dimensions , of which manifolds admit stein structures , and which homotopy classes of almost - complex structures are so realized .",
    "however , the criterion for 4-manifolds is much harder to apply than in other dimensions .",
    "furthermore , if we ignore the delicate framing condition , we immediately run into trouble .",
    "the simplest handlebody interior requiring a 2-handle is @xmath52 .",
    "while this admits a complex structure ( @xmath53 ) , it admits no stein structure , because it contains a homologically essential 2-sphere with trivial normal bundle .",
    "( by seiberg - witten theory , every smoothly embedded essential sphere in a stein surface has normal euler number @xmath54 @xcite . ) to simplify the 4-dimensional characterization , we apply the fundamental principle of freedman @xcite , @xcite , that high - dimensional differential topology frequently works in dimension 4 after we give up smoothness and enter the purely topological world . we replace the problematic 2-handles by more flexible _ casson handles _ , which are homeomorphic to the open 2-handle @xmath55 but have exotic smooth structures .",
    "we then recover a precise analog of eliashberg s theorem up to homeomorphism .",
    "[ abstop ] @xcite .",
    "an oriented 4-manifold is homeomorphic to a stein surface if and only if it is homeomorphic to the interior of a handlebody whose handles all have index @xmath48 . every homotopy class of almost - complex structures on such a handlebody interior is realized by an orientation - preserving homeomorphism to a stein surface .",
    "note that 4-dimensional topological handlebodies are uniquely smoothable , since they are made by gluing along 3-manifolds and the gluing maps are uniquely smoothable .",
    "thus , it does not matter whether the handlebody ( or 4-manifold ) in the theorem is topological or smooth . to see why a homeomorphism determines a bijection of homotopy classes of almost - complex structures ( which can be reinterpreted as spin@xmath56-structures since the base is essentially a 2-complex ) , see @xcite .",
    "one way to interpret this result is that eliashberg s theorem holds in all dimensions , provided that when @xmath3 we are allowed to change the smooth structure on the manifold .",
    "the resulting smooth structures have peculiarities typical to dimension 4 .",
    "such stein surfaces are typically not diffeomorphic to the interior of any compact 4-manifold , even if the original handlebody is finite .",
    "furthermore , a single handlebody often corresponds to uncountably many diffeomorphism types of stein surfaces .",
    "we now return to the question of which open subsets @xmath8 of a fixed complex surface @xmath5 are isotopic to stein open subsets .",
    "we wish to find characterizations analogous to the theorems of the previous section .",
    "note that @xmath8 inherits a complex structure from @xmath5 , and any isotopy of @xmath8 induces a homotopy of complex structures ( which we now view as almost - complex structures ) .",
    "thus , we should ignore our previous hypotheses regarding almost - complex structures , since they are now built into the topological setup .",
    "we are left with hypotheses regarding morse functions or handlebodies , and these turn out also to suffice in the ambient setting .",
    "we first state the analog of theorem  [ absn ] and corollary  [ absn1 ] .",
    "[ ambin ] ( eliashberg . ) for @xmath47 , an open subset @xmath8 of a complex @xmath2-manifold @xmath5 is smoothly isotopic to a stein open subset if and only if it admits an exhausting morse function whose critical points all have index @xmath24 , or equivalently , it is diffeomorphic to the interior of a smooth handlebody with all indices @xmath24 .",
    "our requirement that handlebodies be morse - ordered and without collars is again convenient here , for we can think of embedded handlebodies as tubular neighborhoods of smoothly embedded cw - complexes .",
    "we investigate this correspondence more deeply in section  [ onion ] .",
    "theorem  [ ambin ] is implicit in @xcite in the sense that it follows by the method of proof of theorem  1.3.6 of that paper .",
    "however , it does not seem to have previously appeared in the above form .",
    "there is essentially a complete proof in a paper of forstneri and slapar @xcite .",
    "their main objective was to extend eliashberg s work to make a manifold stein while a preassigned continuous map to some complex manifold becomes homotopic to a holomorphic map .",
    "if one erases the parts concerning the auxiliary map , however , one essentially obtains the proof of theorem  [ ambin ] implicit in @xcite .",
    "( more precisely , one immediately obtains theorem  [ ambin ] by applying theorem  1.2 of @xcite to the complex manifold @xmath8 , setting the auxiliary complex manifold equal to a point . )",
    "next we consider the ambient analog of theorem  [ abs2 ] .",
    "we have already seen that theorem  [ ambin ] fails when @xmath3 .",
    "( consider the obvious embedding @xmath59 . )",
    "the problem is that the manifold @xmath8 may not even abstractly admit a stein structure .",

    "[ ambi2 ] @xcite .",
    "an open subset @xmath8 of a complex surface is smoothly isotopic to a stein open subset if and only if the induced complex structure on @xmath8 is homotopic ( through almost - complex structures on @xmath8 ) to a stein structure on @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the difficulty of making open subsets stein by smooth isotopy in this dimension is already contained in the problem of abstractly creating a stein structure , and is addressed by theorem  [ abs2 ] .    [ r4 ] let @xmath60 be one of the exotic @xmath0s of example  [ abstract](b ) .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath8 admits a stein structure . but @xmath8 is contractible , so it has a unique homotopy class of almost - complex structures compatible with the given orientation . by arranging the identification of @xmath0 with @xmath1 to respect this orientation , we guarantee that the induced complex structure on @xmath8 is homotopic to a stein structure . since a smooth isotopy preserves the diffeomorphism type of the domain , theorem  [ ambi2 ] exhibits a domain of holomorphy in @xmath1 diffeomorphic to @xmath8 , an exotic @xmath0 .",

    ", the extra hypothesis disappears when we replace 2-handles by casson handles .",
    "we obtain a precise analog of theorem  [ ambin ] for @xmath3 , up to topological isotopy .",

    "this is essentially proven , in an expository manner , in @xcite .",

    "( for example , construct a suitable continuous map from the core 2-complex to a rational surface , then homotope it to an immersion and pull back the complex structure . ) theorem  [ ambitop ] with @xmath62 completes the proof .",

    "( this requires a small amount of control of the boundaries of these subsets , but is not a problem here . ) by the method of @xcite , we can then distinguish uncountably many diffeomorphism types of these domains of holomorphy , all topologically isotopic ( hence homeomorphic ) to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "thus , if @xmath67 is topologically isotopic to any domain of holomorphy , then there are uncountably many diffeomorphism types of such .",
    "note that this construction preserves the minimal genus of every homology class of @xmath12 , so in ( a ) above we have uncountably many diffeomorphism types for each embedding of @xmath66 and each @xmath69 .",
    "one would expect this uncountability to be typical , with any complex surface @xmath5 in place of @xmath1 .",
    "this can be proven in many special cases ( @xcite , see also theorem  [ onion ] below ) , but the general case seems out of range of current technology .",
    "the theorems of the previous two sections can be thought of as manifestations of gromov s _ h - principle _",
    "@xcite , @xcite . for many problems such as constructing complex or symplectic structures or smooth immersions ,",
    "one first has to solve a topological problem at the level of bundle theory .",
    "the h - principle for such a problem asserts that a solution at the level of bundle theory guarantees a solution to the complete problem .",
    "this clearly fails for putting complex structures on closed manifolds : a solution at the level of bundles is an almost - complex structure , but many closed , almost - complex manifolds do not admit complex structures , and there seems to be no hope of reducing the gap to a topological criterion .",

    "we would like to derive the lemma as a sort of h - principle .",

    "we wish to kill the obstruction by appending an additional regular homotopy of the legendrian embedding @xmath126 . in order not to lose the legendrian condition",

    "since every contact structure can be locally identified with the standard model in @xmath142 , we can identify a neighborhood of some point of @xmath143 in @xmath86 with a standard neighborhood in @xmath144 , so that the standard `` front '' projection to @xmath31 appears as a cusp , as in figure  [ yasha](a ) .",

    "in fact , it is not possible to arbitrarily change the obstruction without losing control of the topological knot type of @xmath145 , and this is why eliashberg s method fails for 4-dimensional 2-handles .",

    "we have the analogous obstruction ( in @xmath137 or @xmath147 , depending on the parity of @xmath2 ) , but this time we can change it arbitrarily .",
    "the analogous front projection is obtained from figure  [ yasha](a ) by crossing with extra dimensions ( to obtain an @xmath87-manifold in @xmath108 ) . instead of pushing an arc of the manifold through the adjacent sheet , we push through a compact @xmath87-manifold @xmath148 with boundary .",
    "one can compute that the resulting change in the obstruction is just the euler characteristic of @xmath148 , which can be any integer ( whereas a compact 1-manifold must have nonnegative euler characteristic ) .",
    "thus , we can modify the regular homotopy to make the obstruction vanish when @xmath146 .",

    "since @xmath151 has winding number 1 in @xmath31 , it follows that the contact framing of @xmath82 differs by one twist from the normal framing to @xmath100 in the handle .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath3 , any holomorphic 2-handle must be attached along a legendrian knot with framing obtained from its contact framing by adding a ( left ) twist .",
    "this is precisely the condition given in theorem  [ abs2 ] .    when @xmath3 , the proof of theorem  [ absn ] only fails for 2-handles .",
    "the given condition on the framings allows us to bypass lemma  [ hprin ] , to attach standard complex 2-handles with @xmath93 preserving @xmath92 along @xmath82 .",
    "these can be arranged to preserve the stein condition as before .    in the ambient case ,",
    "the main idea for the higher - dimensional theorem  [ ambin ] still works , although the details are more delicate .",
    "we must incorporate the extra data about the stein structure homotopic to @xmath152 , in order to bypass lemma  [ hprin ] for the 2-handles .",
    "however , it is too much to expect that the resulting stein open subset will be holomorphically equivalent to the hypothesized stein surface , so we must give up some information , relying on the contact structures to carry enough data . for a complete proof , see @xcite .",
    "to understand the context into which theorem  [ abs2 ] fits , it is helpful to analyze lemma  [ hprin ] when @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", the obstruction can be interpreted as a mismatch between framings .",
    "note that in figure  [ yasha ] , for example , we can return from ( b ) to ( a ) by an isotopy ( although not through legendrian knots ) .",
    "the resulting regular homotopy from ( a ) to ( b ) and back carries along a normal framing , but returns it with two extra twists .",
    "( draw a curve parallel to the one in ( a ) , carry the pair through the regular homotopy , and observe directly that two left twists appear . )",
    "the resulting framing change can be interpreted as a normal euler class , for example on the immersed torus @xmath153 in @xmath154 that is homologous to @xmath155 .",
    "the phenomenon now reduces to the observation that for a closed , orientable , generically immersed surface , its normal euler number differs from the self - intersection number of its homology class by twice the signed number of double points ( which follows easily from the definitions , e.g. @xcite exercise  6.1.1(a ) and solution ) .",
    "thus , the framing condition in theorem  [ abs2 ] corresponds to suitably killing the obstruction in lemma  [ hprin ] .",
    "while we can not apply the whitney trick as in that lemma , it remains true that attaching circles can be @xmath14-small isotoped to become legendrian ( although we lose control of the almost - complex structures on the corresponding handles ) .",
    "we can then change the obstruction arbitrarily in one direction but not in the other .",
    "( figure  [ yasha ] changes the obstruction by 2 , but it can also be changed by 1 by adding a zig - zag . ) to apply theorem  [ abs2 ] , the problem then becomes to draw a handle diagram for @xmath8 , where the attaching circles are legendrian with sufficiently large contact framings ( or _ thurston - bennequin invariants _ , in the language of legendrian knot theory ) .",
    "this is much harder than applying the higher - dimensional theory , but sometimes still tractable .",
    "see e.g. @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for examples and applications .",
    "once a legendrian handle diagram is specified for @xmath8 , the homotopy class of the corresponding stein structure is determined by the _ rotation numbers _ of the legendrian knots .",

    "a knot can be made legendrian for only finitely many choices of the rotation number , once the thurston - bennequin invariant is specified .",
    "this reflects the fact that a 4-manifold may be stein realizing some , but not all , choices of the homotopy class of the almost - complex structure .    in either case ,",
    "the difficulty is that while we can attach the 2-handles to legendrian knots with the correct rotation numbers , we can not do so with the framings required for a stein structure .",
    "( that is , the thurston - bennequin invariants will be too negative , so that the contact framings of the legendrian knots will be far from the framings of the 2-handles . ) as we have seen , however , these obstructions can be interpreted as normal euler numbers , which suitably count double points . we can kill the obstructions by replacing the core disks of the 2-handles by immersed disks .",
    "( in the case of theorem  [ ambitop ] , the cores may only be topologically embedded , in which case it takes work of freedman and quinn to find suitable smoothly immersed disks . )",
    "we now obtain a stein structure , but on the wrong manifold  each double point of an immersed disk contributes a new generator to the fundamental group .",
    "we can kill these generators by adding 2-handles , recovering @xmath8 but losing the stein structure .",
    "if we instead allow double points in the new 2-handles , we recover the stein structure but again have extra fundamental group .",
    "we inductively kill the extra generators at each stage by adding immersed disks at the next stage , obtaining an infinite union that inherits a stein structure .",
    "this procedure replaces each 2-handle by an infinite tower called a _",
    "casson handle_. these casson handles are simply connected ( since any loop lies in a finite subtower , so it is nullhomotopic at the next stage ) .",
    "in fact , according to freedman  @xcite , every casson handle is homeomorphic to an open 2-handle @xmath156 , so our final stein surface is homeomorphic to @xmath8 . for further details ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we have seen that for some of our purposes , the morse and handlebody viewpoints are interchangeable , but for other purposes , one viewpoint is more natural than the other . for 4-manifolds with infinite topology , for example ,",
    "theorem  [ abs2 ] is most easily stated using handlebodies . in this section ,",
    "we adapt the theorems of section  [ ambient ] to the setting of embedded handlebodies , which allows us to use a sharper notion of isotopy ( namely _ ambient _ isotopy ) .",
    "we also introduce a third viewpoint , focusing on the totally real cw - complex forming the core of the handlebody .",
    "we show that suitably embedded cw - complexes can be isotoped to become totally real and pseudoconvex in the sense of being nested intersections of stein open subsets .",
    "this is particularly striking in the 4-dimensional topological setting , where the resulting uncountable stein neighborhood systems frequently realize uncountably many diffeomorphism types , even though the neighborhoods are all homeomorphic relative to the embedded complex .    throughout this section",
    ", we rely on informal terminology , hypothesizing that stein manifolds are made by a particular method . when we construct a stein manifold ,",

    "@xcite we use more precise and general terminology , with definitions that are currently too cumbersome to state here . instead , we try to indicate the most important points . for example",
    ", a stein manifold constructed by eliashberg s method is assumed to be exhibited as the interior of a handlebody with pseudoconvex boundary , and in the ambient setting , this handlebody is embedded .",
    "thus , we are given a partial collaring at infinity by pseudoconvex hypersurfaces , extending to a smooth mapping cylinder structure surrounding a cw - complex core that we can assume is smooth and totally real .",
    "the subhandlebodies inherit similar structure .    a smooth ( or topological ) _",
    "ambient isotopy _ of a manifold @xmath5 is an isotopy of the identity on @xmath5 through diffeomorphisms ( or homeomorphisms ) of @xmath5 .",
    "an isotopy of an open subset @xmath8 of @xmath5 need not extend to an ambient isotopy of @xmath5 , because the _ end _ of @xmath8 ( the part outside large compact subsets of @xmath8 ) can be troublesome . for example , @xmath157 is isotopic , but not ambiently isotopic , to the complement of a disk , and an arbitrary @xmath5 is not ambiently isotopic to any proper subset of itself .",
