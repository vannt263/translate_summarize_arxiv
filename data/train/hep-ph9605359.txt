    "recent experimental results concerning the rate of @xmath9 quark production at lep  1 ( @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 ) and the distribution of high-@xmath12 jets at the tevatron ( as reported by the cdf collaboration @xcite ) , that may indicate the first departure from standard model expectations , have revived interest in @xmath0 models as possible beyond - the - standard - model explanations for these phenomena @xcite . in order not to disturb the agreement with standard model expectations in the lepton sector at lep , the new @xmath0 scenarios call for a leptophobic @xmath0 that mixes with the regular @xmath13 .",
    "is also to explain the cdf data , it should be unusually broad and heavy @xcite . as d0 has studied a much larger data sample than that reported by cdf , and no anomalous distributions",
    "have been observed @xcite , we do not consider @xmath0 gauge bosons with such characteristics here . for a comparison of the cdf and d0 results",
    "see ref .",
    "such a @xmath0 may shift @xmath1 in an interesting way if its couplings to quarks are suitably chosen .",
    "however , one must insure that the total hadronic width ( @xmath2 ) remains essentially unchanged relative to standard model expectations , as it agrees rather well with observations .",
    "a new constraint in this class of models has recently arisen , in that the @xmath3 ratio is now found to agree rather well with standard model expectations ( @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 ) .",
    "traditional @xmath0 searches at hadron colliders ( _ i.e. _ , via its decay into charged leptons @xcite ) are not sensitive to a leptophobic @xmath0 , whereas @xmath16 searches @xcite are hampered by much larger backgrounds , although excluded regions of parameter space can still be obtained . the influence of a leptophobic @xmath0 may also be felt via additional contributions to the top - quark cross section @xcite , enhanced @xmath17 event yields at the tevatron @xcite , and spin asymmetries in polarized @xmath4 collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "if such a @xmath0 explanation to the seemingly anomalous data is to be taken seriously , one must provide a consistent theoretical framework where the new gauge boson and its required properties arise naturally . in our minds that should be taken to be string model - building , where the thorny question of cancellation of anomalies is dealt with automatically .",
    "new light neutral gauge bosons were early on considered to be the  smoking guns \" of string , back when @xmath18 was the proverbial string - inspired gauge group @xcite .",
    "the popularity of string @xmath0s however waned as non - grand - unified gauge groups became the natural outcome of actual string - derived models , such as su(5)@xmath19u(1 ) [  flipped su(5 ) \" ] , su(3)@xmath8 , su(4)@xmath19su(2)@xmath19su(2 ) [  pati - salam \" models ] , and su(3)@xmath19su(2)@xmath19u(1 ) [  standard - like \" models ] . in these models one in fact has an excess of u(1 ) gauge groups at the string scale , but they typically get broken in the vacuum shifting process required to cancel the anomalous @xmath20 that is characteristic of this type of string constructions .",
    "it is then interesting to explore whether string models can accomodate such gauge bosons at all , a search that is likely to lead to new and restrictive constraints on string model building . in this paper",
    "we explore this question in the context of stringy flipped su(5 ) .",
    "we first show that leptophobia is very natural in flipped su(5 ) , and that it may provide the shift in @xmath1 that seems to be preferred experimentally ( sec .",
    "[ sec : rbrc ] ) , while at the same time keeping @xmath2 and @xmath3 essentially unchanged .",
    "we then explore three scenarios for possible leptophobic @xmath0 gauge bosons in a string - derived version of flipped su(5 ) ( sec .",
    "[ sec : scenarios ] ) .",
    "our second scenario is particularly compelling , entailing generation non - universal @xmath0 couplings to quarks ; it is further studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : revisited ] .",
    "we also discuss the current experimental limits on and the prospects for detecting such @xmath0 gauge bosons , which possess parity - violating @xmath0 couplings to up - type quarks , and may yield observable contributions to spin asymmetries in polarized @xmath4 scattering experiments being prepared for rhic ( sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] ) . sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "let us first point out that leptophobia is very _ natural _ in su(5)@xmath19u(1 ) , where the particle content of the standard model is contained in the representations @xmath21 the new @xmath0 would be leptophobic if @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( which contain the standard model leptons ) are uncharged under the new u(1 ) , while most of the quarks ( in @xmath24 ) could still couple to it .",
    "in contrast , in regular su(5 ) ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , so(10 ) , or @xmath18 such a separation ( symmetry - based leptophobia ) is not possible .",
    "however , leptophobia may still be achieved dynamically under certain circumstances , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of the subgroup of @xmath18 called the  @xmath27-model \" @xcite .",
    "the effect of a @xmath0 mixing with the regular @xmath13 and its impact on lep physics has been addressed previously , particularly in the context of @xmath28 @xcite . here",
    "we present a succinct discussion , emphasizing the flipped su(5 ) novelties .",
    "small @xmath13-@xmath0 mixing amounts to a shift in the vector and axial - vector couplings of the standard @xmath13 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the small @xmath13-@xmath0 mixing angle , @xmath31 is the usual weak coupling , @xmath32 is the new @xmath33 gauge coupling , @xmath34 are the usual vector and axial - vector @xmath13 couplings to fermions , and @xmath35 are related to the charges of the fermions under @xmath33 . as eq .",
    "( [ eq : reps ] ) shows , a leptophobic @xmath0 in flipped su(5 ) violates parity in the up - quark sector , but not in the down - quark sector . using @xmath36 and @xmath37 we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the @xmath33 charge of the @xmath41 representation .",
    "these results apply to each individual generation , which generally could have different charges under @xmath33 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath42 .    with the above information , which depends solely on the flipped su(5 ) origin of the leptophobic @xmath0",
    ", one can obtain the first - order shifts in @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( and therefore @xmath28 ) in terms of the composite parameter @xmath46 recalling that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , one can easily determine the relevant first - order shifts ( _ i.e. _ , linear in @xmath49 ) for arbitrary choices of the @xmath42 charges .    what should the @xmath33 charges of the su(5 ) multiplets be ?",
    "this question can be answered exactly in explicit string models , as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : second ] .",
    "for now let us just state our choices : @xmath50 these charge choices reflect some principles : the leptons ( in @xmath51 ) are uncharged ( leptophobia ) ; there is a pair of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) whose neutral components acquire gut scale vevs and break su(5)@xmath19u(1 ) in the standard way , and by virtue of being uncharged leave @xmath33 unbroken ; the remaining representations enforce @xmath54 and contain three generations of quarks and an extra @xmath52 to allow string unification .",
    "the @xmath42 are then to be taken from the set @xmath55 , where the number in parenthesis indicates the number of generations that may carry such charge .    in table",
    "[ table0 ] we display the 13 possible charge combinations , along with the fractional changes in @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 in units of @xmath49 .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is constrained by its effect on the many electroweak observables , where it enters through a tree - level correction to the @xmath56 parameter due to the @xmath13-@xmath0 mixing .",
    "detailed fits to the electroweak data allow values of @xmath57 as large as @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "for the representative choice @xmath59 , in table  [ table0 ] we also display the actual shifts in @xmath2 ( in mev ) , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 , all of which scale linearly with @xmath49 . to help decide which of the charge assignments satisfy the present experimental constraints , in fig .",
    "[ fig : rbghad ] we plot the correlated values of @xmath60 versus @xmath61 , for each of the 13 charge assignments ( the lines are parametrized by @xmath49 ) .",
    "note that different charge assignments may yield the same @xmath62-@xmath61 correlation .",
    "since the lep measured value of @xmath2 agrees with the standard model prediction within 1  mev , and the experimental uncertainty in @xmath2 is 3  mev , we constrain possible charge assignments by requiring @xmath63 , as denoted by the vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : rbghad ] .",
    "furthermore , we demand that @xmath62 be in the interval @xmath64 ( denoted by the horizontal dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : rbghad ] ) , such that when added to the standard model prediction ( @xmath65 , for @xmath66 ) the resulting @xmath1 falls within the experimental allowed window : , which are not expected to be enhanced @xcite , especially in supergravity models @xcite . in any event , shifting @xmath62 somewhat does not change the set of allowed charge assignments . ]",
    "@xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : rbghad ] we conclude that only charge assignments 2,5,10,11,12 satisfy the experimental requirements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    to consider the effect of @xmath3 , in fig .",

    "only cases 2,5,11,12 satisfy the experimental requirements from @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 . and @xmath69 ,",
    "we exclude from further consideration charge assignments that entail shifts in the same direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , cases 1,6,7,9,10 . ]",
    "it is important to note that these charge assignments predict modest shifts in @xmath3 : @xmath70 , which are below the present experimental sensitivity and therefore naturally ` protect ' the standard model prediction .",
    "we are then left with four experimentally preferred charge assignments : @xmath71 we note that these charge assignments are unlike any that have been so far considered in the literature .",
    "in fact , the popular assumption of a generation - independent @xmath33 charge is violated explicitly in these four successful cases .",
    "the constraints imposed by flipped su(5 ) make that case ( 13 in table  [ table0 ] ) disfavored by experimental data .",
    "note also that the first two assignments imply @xmath72 or @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "these perhaps  unnatural \" charge assignments occur quite naturally in the string model . for future reference",
    ", we point out that in the string model @xmath74 is required to contain the third - generation quarks in order to generate the top - quark yukawa coupling . from eq .",

    "( [ eq : prefs ] ) . in this stringy preferred case",
    "we obtain the following relation @xmath76 ( and also @xmath77 ) .    before proceeding",
    ", we should address the question of flavor - changing - neutral currents ( fcnc ) that necessarily arise in our model because the generation non - universal couplings of the @xmath0 to quarks spoil the gim cancellation .",
    "for a leptophobic @xmath0 the tree - level @xmath0-mediated contributions to @xmath78 , and @xmath79 should provide the strongest constraints .",
    "as usual , in obtaining the ckm matrix @xmath80 there is freedom of how to choose @xmath81 and @xmath82 such that @xmath83 agrees with experimental observations . in ref .  @xcite it is shown that taking @xmath84 , the experimental value of @xmath79 forces our parameter @xmath49 to uninterestingly small values .",

    "in the context of stringy flipped su(5 ) , we will consider four criteria in the search for suitable u(1 ) gauge symmetries : they should be anomaly - free , leptophobic , unbroken , and mixed .",
    "the anomaly - free requirement can only be addressed in the context of a fundamental theory ( such as string theory ) , where anomaly - free symmetries are automatic ( although they may need to be broken ) .",
    "the ( low - energy ) leptophobia requirement is dictated by phenomenology and can be enforced by symmetry , or achieved dynamically via mixing in the gauge kinetic functions @xcite .",
    "the new u(1 ) should remain unbroken after the vacuum shifting at the planck scale that is required to cancel the anomalous @xmath20 .",
    "finally , since the new gauge boson must be leptophobic , it can not be produced directly at lep , and thus can affect lep physics only via mixing with the regular @xmath13 .",
    "we seek the above properties in the context of a string - derived version of the su(5)@xmath19u(1 ) model @xcite that has been shown to possess various desirable properties regarding the vacuum energy , string unification , the dynamical generation of all mass scales , the top - quark mass , and the strong coupling @xcite .",
    "the complete gauge group of the model breaks up into three identifiable pieces @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "the 63 massless matter fields in the model are listed in tables  [ table1],[table2],[table3],[table4 ] , along with their charges under @xmath97 . of note",
    "is the fact that @xmath98 , whereas @xmath99 .",
    "these seemingly anomalous symmetries are artifacts of the truncation of the full string spectrum down to the massless sector .",
    "the low - energy effective theory is correctly specified by first  rotating \" all the anomaly into a single anomalous @xmath100u_i$ ] @xcite , and then adding a one - loop correction to the d - term corresponding to @xmath101 : @xmath102 , where @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum of all the states in the tables can be obtained in a complicated procedure that takes into account the trilinear and non - renormalizable contributions to the superpotential and therefore to the masses and interactions @xcite .",
    "such procedure does not have a unique outcome because the values of the vevs of the singlet fields in table  [ table2 ] are unknown ( although constrained by the anomalous @xmath101 cancellation conditions ) .",
    "the objective of this exercise is to obtain an electroweak - scale spectrum that resembles closely that of the mssm .",
    "for instance , in table  [ table1 ] only one pair of higgs pentaplets ( their doublet components only ) should survive to low energies .",
    "below we will find constraints on which states must belong to the low - energy sector of the theory .",
    "we also note that the possible @xmath33 symmetries that we identify below do not change the predictions of the string model for the superpotential yukawa couplings , as these symmetries are derived along with the rest of the model .",
    "the problem of hierarchical fermion mass generation finds a possible resolution in string models . as is well known , several internal ( world - sheet )",
    "symmetries severely restrict the allowed yukawa couplings , typically predicting non - zero trilinear couplings for only the third family .",
    "non - renormalizable terms usually contain the remaining yukawa couplings , but these are naturally suppressed by powers of a small ratio that arises in the cancellation of the anomalous @xmath101 . this program has met with some success in the present model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath104 gauge symmetry is traceless ( anomaly - free ) , the leptons ( @xmath105 ) are not charged under it ( leptophobic , see table  [ table1 ] ) , and it does not participate in the @xmath20 cancellation mechanism ( unbroken ) .",
    "moreover , some of the quarks are charged under @xmath104 .",
    "the problem is that @xmath104 and @xmath106 do not mix : the higgs doublets that break the electroweak symmetry",
    "are uncharged under @xmath107 ( see @xmath108 in table  [ table1 ] ) . the mixing via the gauge kinetic functions",
    "is not operative , as one can easily verify that @xmath109 .",
    "this fact  protects \" the leptophobia , as otherwise the leptons would get their @xmath107 charges shifted away from zero .",
    "the only representations charged under @xmath107 that may also contain quark fields are @xmath110 . making this assignment also keeps @xmath107 unbroken through the su(5)@xmath19u(1 ) symmetry - breaking process at the gut scale .",
    "the @xmath107 symmetry may be broken radiatively at low energies if the singlet fields @xmath111 , which solely carry the @xmath107 charge ( see table  [ table2 ] ) , acquire suitable dynamical vacuum expectation values .",
    "as such this @xmath0 will not affect lep physics , as it does not obviously mix with the @xmath13 . however , direct detection at hadron colliders via its hadronic decays or parity - violating spin asymmetries is possible .",
    "if we assume that @xmath110 contain first- and second - generation fields ( @xmath74 is expected to contain the third generation fields @xcite ) then the @xmath0 couplings to quarks ( @xmath35 ) are as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : charges ] ) , but only for the first- and second - generations . consulting table  [ table1 ] one finds @xmath112 and @xmath113 which , in the event that some mechanism for @xmath13-@xmath0 mixing were to be found , would imply @xmath114 and @xmath115 , leaving @xmath1 unshifted .",
    "there are three linear combinations of @xmath116 that are orthogonal to @xmath117 , and therefore traceless . a suitable basis is provided by : @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "is there a linear combination of @xmath121 that is leptophobic ?",
    "the leptons transform as @xmath122 ; @xmath123 , from which it follows that there is a unique leptophobic linear combination : @xmath124 .",
    "this symmetry is by construction anomaly - free and leptophobic , and some of the higgs pentaplets are charged under it ( _ i.e. _ , mixed ) .",
    "the charges of all fields under @xmath33 are listed in the tables , along with the two additional traceless combinations that can be chosen to be @xmath125 and @xmath126 . from the tables we see that only a very limited set of fields is uncharged under @xmath33 , @xmath127 and therefore their vevs will leave @xmath33 unbroken .",
    "the crucial question is whether the usual d- and f - flatness conditions may be satisfied with such a limited set of vevs .",
    "moreover , this set of vevs generally breaks the hidden sector gauge group .",
    "the feasibility of this scenario will be addressed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : revisited ] below .",
    "let us assume that @xmath33 can indeed remain unbroken down to low energies .",
    "one can verify that @xmath128 ( at least for an appropriately chosen subset of light fields ) and thus the @xmath33 charges are not shifted , and the leptophobia is protected .",
    "previous studies @xcite show that @xmath74 should contain the third - generation quarks .",
    "also , @xmath53 should be engaged in su(5)@xmath19u(1 ) breaking , as they are neutral under @xmath33 , and therefore @xmath129 should contain the additional representations required for string unification @xcite .",
    "it remains to determine the fate of @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , two of which should be assigned to contain the first- and second - generation quarks , whereas the third one will accompany @xmath129 .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath28 analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : rbrc ] provides an important clue .",
    "our assignment of @xmath74 entails @xmath75 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : prefs ] ) then implies @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "this means that @xmath132 ( which has @xmath135 ) should contain the second generation , whereas @xmath130 or @xmath131 ( or a linear combination thereof ) should contain the first generation .      since the unique leptophobic @xmath33 in the second scenario ( in sec .",
    "[ sec : second ] ) requires the hidden sector gauge group @xmath136 to be broken in order to preserve d- and f - flatnes , one may consider giving up a priori leptophobia , hoping to later be able to generate dynamic leptophobia via @xmath137 mixing . this scenario may leave @xmath136 and the desired @xmath137 unbroken , and still preserve flatness . to this end",
    "we determine all possible linear combinations of @xmath138 ( or @xmath139 ) that are uncharged under more than one singlet field ( in table  [ table2 ] ) , with the idea that vevs from this subset of fields should suffice to preserve flatness .",
