    "therefore , we obtain @xmath165     \\times \\left[\\frac{\\beta   } { 2   } r ' - 1+(\\alpha -\\beta ) ( 1+r ) \\right ] , \\label{qrrprime}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an expression depending only on @xmath139",
    ". we can observe that studying an ansatz on @xmath36 would immediately allow us to analyze whether this ansatz respects the gsl , as in the previous case of ( [ strp ] ) .",
    "we recall that the interaction can be written in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath36 according to ( [ qpr ] ) ; however in this context by choosing a horizon we are inherently choosing a pressure . using the pressure ( [ pde ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath140 as a function of @xmath36 and the model parameters @xmath166 , \\label{pr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the result obtained for the pressure ( [ pr ] ) indicates that the evolution of @xmath36 could be determined by the evolution of @xmath140 , relation obtained from the holographic context in ( [ hrl ] ) .",

    "it is equivalent to study the expression for interaction described by ( [ qr ] ) as it is the interaction as a function of the pressure @xmath140 .",
    "the cosmological scenario , for an ansatz in the coincidence parameter given as @xmath169 , was analyzed with observational data from supernovae ia and the results are presented in figure 2 ( left ) , obtaining @xmath170 .",
    "the interaction presents a change of sign before the universe goes from a decelerated to an accelerated phase , however the total entropy change remains positive until the universe reaches 1.5 times its current size , thus respecting the gsl .",
    "this can also be seen in the parameter space of ( @xmath171 ) for @xmath172 in figure 2 ( right ) , where it can be negative in a certain region of this space .",
    "this negative interaction region that can respect gsl is introduced due to considering the hde as the radius from the surface representing the horizon .     in the phase space of ( @xmath171 ) and",
    "the graph on the center is the entropy change and the top is the deceleration parameter and interaction for a specific holographic model , case iii of @xcite .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ]   in the phase space of ( @xmath171 ) and the graph on the center is the entropy change and the top is the deceleration parameter and interaction for a specific holographic model , case iii of @xcite .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ]",
    "the novelty of our work resides in the fact that we propose the hde ansatz as an horizon - like radius to study features of the cosmological interaction using thermodynamics .",
    "furthermore , we consider the interaction with an unknown sign , generalizing previous studies where the interaction is generally given and positive .    in this paper , we studied the effect of gsl in a flat frw universe at late times with holographic dark energy interacting with non - relativistic dark matter .",
    "the interaction @xmath13 is not a phenomenological function given _ a priori _ , but an unknown variable to be studied according to the thermodynamics of the system in equilibrium conditions at late times . in this context",
    ", we examined the validity of the gsl of thermodynamics considering the universe as a thermodynamical system bounded by the length scale @xmath1 .",
    "we see from ( [ qpr ] ) that besides the possibility of a change in the sign of @xmath13 interaction ; this equation is independent of the choice of horizon but depends on the coincidence parameter , its derivative and the eos . considering an unknown @xmath13",
    ", we analyze whether this interacting model respects the gsl of thermodynamics .",
    "when choosing the holographic dark energy density ( [ l ] ) , one can obtain expressions for the change in total entropy in terms of the deceleration parameter ( [ s21 ] ) .",
    "the gsl has implications for the cosmic acceleration of the universe ; from ( [ qc ] ) it can be seen that the holographic parameter @xmath75 has an upper or lower limit depending on whether the deceleration parameter is greater or less than @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "when we applied the gsl of thermodynamics of a surface of radius @xmath1 in hde ( [ qstar ] ) , we obtain two ranges determined by the dark energy pressure , ( [ 28 ] ) and ( [ 29 ] ) , where the unknown interacting function can respect this law .",
    "regarding these ranges , we can conclude that for a negative @xmath87 , the interaction can take positive or negative values , or a transit between the two options and within a certain range respect the gsl of thermodynamics .",
    "the range obtained is dynamic as a consequence of the hde and a negative interaction in this context can not be ruled out .    to examine further the validity of the gsl",
    ", we considered different radius , three known horizon and two new proposals .",
    "unlike other works , we used the horizon for the holographic dark energy density as surface representing a cosmological horizon . the variation with respect to the cosmic time of the total entropy",
    "can be positive or negative depending on the horizon chosen when this horizon includes a term of @xmath49 that inherently determines the pressure .",
    "these results are verified in ricci and ricci - like horizons , where there is an equivalence between the coincidence parameter @xmath36 and the dark energy pressure @xmath19 . for these cases",
    "the cosmic coincidence problem is alleviated , given that when the pressure is a variable function , @xmath36 is also a variable function .",
    "for the rde model , the analysis indicates that the interaction must be mainly positive today in order to respect the gsl , as can be seen from fig 1 . on the other hand",
    ", the ricci - like hde is allowed to be negative and respect gsl but only for a certain range , noticeable in fig 2 ( bottom ) .",
    "the viability of this model can be seen in the observational contrast presented in fig 2 ( top and center ) .",
    "overall , we integrate and generalize previous works , obtain new results and connections among model , thus expanding the studies on holographic dark energy and sign - changeable interactions .",
    "the aspects introduced by each model at different phases in the evolution of the universe will be studied in future research .",
