    "various quantum gravity theories suggest that lorentz symmetry is broken or modified at very high energies @xcite . in most of these models",
    "the low energy limit of the photon dispersion relation is deformed by an addition of extra powers of the particle momentum .",
    "these modifications are suppressed by a high energy scale , beyond which lorentz symmetry is broken . among other implications ,",
    "such terms cause the photon speed to depend on the energy and to differ from the classical speed of light , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "amelino - camelia et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to use the arrival times of photons from cosmological gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) to set experimental bounds on the energy scale of lorentz invariance violation .",
    "the idea was pursued by several groups which obtained observational bounds using ensembles of bursts with known redshfits @xcite , or using a single very powerful and atypical burst grb 021206 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the very bright short burst grb 051221a to test lorentz symmetry and set a new bound on the possible scale of lorentz symmetry violation .",
    "following @xcite , we consider deformations of the dispersion relation of photons which break boost invariance but keep rotational and translational symmetry : e^2 = p^2 c^2 a^2 , n = 1 , 2 , ... .",
    "[ mod_disp_rel ] the non - standard term is suppressed by the high energy scale , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a dimensionless parameter and @xmath4 is the planck energy .",
    "this expression can be thought as a low energy expansion ( compared with @xmath4 ) of a quantum - gravity hamiltonian .",
    "we will focus on @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the following .",
    ". [ mod_disp_rel ] causes the speed of photons to depend on their energy .",
    "two photons emitted simultaneously with different energies , arrive on earth with a time delay @xmath7 . by comparing this time delay ( or the lack of it ) with the time resolution of the observing detector we can set bounds on the lorentz violation parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "the time delay between two photons with energies @xmath8 and @xmath9 emitted simultaneously from a source at a redshift @xmath10 is given by @xcite : t _ _ 0^z ( 1+z)^n dz .",
    "[ time - delay ] we use in the following the  standard \" cosmological parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "grb 051221a was a very powerful bright short burst located in a star forming galaxy at a redshift of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it was observed in the gamma ray regime by three different satellites : swift - bat , suzaku - wam and konus - wind .",
    "swift - bat and konus - wind have comparable instrumental time resolutions , 4 msec and 2 msec respectively .",
    "the time resolution of suzaku - wam is , on the other hand , significantly lower : @xmath15 30 msec .",
    "since we need the highest time resolution for for our purposes @xcite , we only analyze the light curves of swift - bat and konus - wind which provide the strongest bounds .",
    "the bat light curve @xcite is depicted at fig .",
    "[ espectro - swift ] .",
    "it shows several bright short peaks with a duration of @xmath16 msec each .",
    "approximately a second later a second smaller and softer peak followed lasting @xmath15 3 sec .",
    "the overall time resolution of a telescope is determined by the intrinsic detector minimal time resolution , 4 msec for the swift - bat data , and the photon arrival rate @xcite . for grb 051221a ,",
    "the resolution associated with the photon arrival rate in the kev range is smaller than the instrumental resolution , 4msec . at the higher energy band , ( 300 - 350 )",
    "kev , the photon arrival rate becomes too small and we need to switch to the unfiltered data .",
    "overall , the instrumental resolution is setting the limiting resolution .    to constrain the parameter @xmath3",
    "we compare the light - curves covering the ( 15 , 35 ) , ( 50 , 150 ) kev , ( 100 , 150 ) and ( 300 , 350 ) kev energy bands .",
    "we have measured the time positions of the four main peaks in fig .",
    "[ espectro - swift ] ( measured in 4 msec time bins ) :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these bounds are slightly better than the bounds obtained from the swift data .",
    "this improvement is simply due to the better intrinsic time resolution , 2 msec of konus - wind versus 4 msec in swift .",
    "we set new bounds on the possible energy scale of lorentz invariance violation .",
    "to do so , we used the simultaneity of peak emission times in the light curves in different energy bands observed by swift - bat and konus - wind for grb 051221a .",
    "the order of magnitude of the bounds depends on how the photon dispersion relation is deformed . in the models where a cubic term in the momentum is added ( @xmath5 ) the",
    "best bound we obtained is 0.0066 @xmath4 .",
    "when a quartic term is added ( @xmath6 ) the effect is much smaller and the corresponding best bound is @xmath17 .",
    "the present work complements previous studies which found bounds of similar order of magnitude .",
    "ellis et al .",
    "@xcite performed a statistical analysis in an ensemble of bursts with known redshifts ( to correct for intrinsic time delays ) , finding the bounds @xmath18 and @xmath19 at a 95% of confidence level .",
    "in general , intrinsic delays render difficult to constrain lorentz violations using a single burst , but we can still extract lower limits if there is simultaneity in the peak emissions . in our study , since no time delays are observed in the light curves with 2 msec bins , we can assume that , at that resolution , all photons were emitted simultaneously .",
    "this is , of course , an assumption .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility in which intrinsic spectral temporal shifts are exactly compensated by the time delays produced by the modified dispersion relation , eq .",
    "[ mod_disp_rel ] . while , in principle , this is possible , we believe it to be extremely unlikely .",
    "boggs et al .",
    "@xcite considered an unique extremely bright burst grb 021206 observed by rhessi .",
    "this burst has an almost flat spectrum in the band 1 - 17 mev , which allowed estimates of the time delay up to 17 mev .",
    "the redshift of grb 021206 is not known as no host galaxy was detected .",
    "assuming a redshift of @xmath20 and using the simultaneity of the peaks at different energies , boggs et al . , @xcite obtained the bounds @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "these lower bounds are higher than ours by factors of 2.5 and 9 respectively",
    ". however , the redshift of this burst was not measured , but only estimated from the spectral and temporal properties of the burst . from this point of view , the present estimate , which is based on a burst with a known redshift , is more robust .",
