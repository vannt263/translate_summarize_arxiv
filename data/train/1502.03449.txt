    "the stellar imf , i.e. the mass distribution of stars in a stellar population ( hereafter sp ) at birth , has been largely assumed to be universal , mostly because of lack of evidence regarding variations of the imf among star clusters and ob associations in our galaxy ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "furthermore , no correlation of dynamical constraints with sp parameters has been detected in the @xmath9 sample @xcite .",
    "given the importance of constructing a comprehensive theory of a non - universal imf ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the above inconsistencies call for further investigations , based on larger samples , of the possible drivers of imf variations . in lb13 , we assembled a battery of 126 stacked spectra , with varying @xmath7  and @xmath1 $ ] , finding that gravity - sensitive features in etgs depend very mildly on @xmath1 $ ] at fixed @xmath7 .",
