    "when the phase velocity of nonlinear polarization wave ( @xmath0 ) exceeds that of the harmonic waves ( @xmath1 ) in the nonlinear medium , it will emit coherent electromagnetic waves called nonlinear cerenkov radiation ( ncr ) @xcite .",
    "the cerenkov angle is defined as @xmath2 , which implies the automatically longitudinal phase - matching condition between the fundamental and the radiated harmonic waves . with @xmath3 photonic crystals @xcite ,",
    "waveguides @xcite or other micro - structures assistance are introduced , cerenkov radiation could demonstrate possibilities of a wide variety of phase - matching types and diverse patterns of spatial modulation .",
    "for instance , the phase - tuned cerenkov - type interaction in two dimensional nonlinear photonic crystals @xcite , the quasi - phase - matching associated ncr generated in waveguides or nonlinear @xmath3 crystals @xcite , domain wall enhanced high - order ncr @xcite , and so on . such modulation mechanism has greatly expanded the ncr radiation characteristics , providing potential applications of short wavelength lasers @xcite , broadband frequency doubling @xcite and optical imaging @xcite .",
    "in addition , the efficiency of ncr is mainly effected by the abrupt change of the second - order nonlinearity @xmath3 , which contains not only the -1 to 1 @xmath3 modulation corresponding to the domain wall but also the modulation 0 to 1 corresponding to the crystal surface @xcite . by using sum frequency polarization wave generated by incident and internal total reflected waves @xcite , previous studies have achieved enhanced ncr on the crystal surface @xcite .",
    "such ncr can provide good light quality and relatively high efficiency , which allows further practical applications , such as nondestructive diagnostics , harmonic conversion and ultrashort pulse characterization .    in this work",
    ", we study the behavior of ncr generated from the crystal surface and modulated by the @xmath3 microstructure on the surface . using coupled wave equation",
    ", we also demonstrate the effect of reciprocal vectors of photonic crystals to the radiation angles of ncr . by utilizing the internal reflection inside the crystal boundary ,",
    "the sum - frequency polarization of the incidences associated with different orders of reciprocal vectors can emit multiple ncr which exhibits @xmath3 spatial modulated pattern . particularly , at specific incident angles ,",
    "one can achieve degenerated ncr which leads to remarkable enhancement on the efficiency .",
    "for simplicity , here we choose a one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodically poled @xmath4 crystal ( ppln ) which provides uniform collinear reciprocal vectors along x - axis as shown in fig .",
    "the poling period of the sample @xmath5 and it was put on a rotation stage which can be adjusted in the y - z plane . regarding to the calculation of the sellmeier equation of the sample @xcite , one can find the refractive index of ordinary - polarized fundamental wave is larger than that of the extraordinary - polarized second harmonic wave when the wavelength of pump is longer than 1023 nm .",
    "consequently , it provides an anomalous - dispersion - like medium by utilizing type ( oo - e ) shg phase - matching interaction scheme @xcite .",
    "the light source we used was an optical parametric amplifier ( topas , coherent inc . ) producing 80 femtosecond pulses ( 1000 hz rep .",
    "rate ) at the variable wavelengths from 280 nm to 2600 nm .",
    "a quarter - wave plate and a glan - prism were set to adjust the polarization of incidences .",
    "the laser beam was loosely focused into the x - z plane of the sample and a screen located 10 cm behind the sample to receive the emitted patterns .",
    "the operating temperature was kept at 20 @xmath6c .",
    "when the ordinary polarized fundamental wave ( fw ) with a wavelength of 1250 nm injecting into the y - z plane of the sample , there was no ncr emerge owing to the phase - matching condition being not satisfied in such anomalous dispersion .",
    "as rotating the sample along x - axis , the fundamental beam would reach the x - y plane and be reflected on this surface while the incidence angle exceed the requirement of total reflection inside the sample . by adjusting the incident angle of fw , and combining the total reflection wave and reciprocal vectors , the sum - frequency polarization along the crystal surface would give birth to ncr . the far - filed image on the screen",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the straight line of dots in middle is the nonlinear raman - nath diffraction generated from the sum - frequency of incidences and total reflection , while the right arc line belongs to the conical scattering second harmonic ( sh ) .",
    "the fascinating phenomenon happened on the left of the sum - frequency raman - nath diffraction , where appeared multiple cerenkov diffraction pattern with transverse angular dispersion lying in an arc array .",
    "distinguished from the phenomena in bulk material , the pattern exhibits periodically spatial distribution , which denotes to the reciprocal - involved ncr by total reflection on the ppln surface .    to analyse the distribution of sh , the coupled wave equation under paraxial and small - signal approximation was solved using the fourier transform , and the intensity of sh @xmath7 was expressed as @xcite : @xmath8 ^ 2i_1 ^ 2l^2\\mathrm{sinc}^2\\big[\\big(k_2 - 2k_1\\mathrm{cos}\\alpha-\\frac{k_x^2+k_z^2}{2k_2}\\big)\\frac{l}{2}\\big]|f(k_x)|^2|g(k_z)|^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the refractive index of the sh , @xmath10 denotes the complex amplitudes of the gaussian fw with width @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the interaction distance of the nonlinear process , @xmath13 is the incident angle of fw to @xmath14 axis , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the wave vectors of the fw and sh , respectively . in the expression , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the wave vector of reflected fw . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the components of @xmath16 in @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the fourier transform of @xmath3 modulated structure which are introduced by periodically reversed domains and the crystal boundary , respectively . and @xmath25 are the fourier coefficients which can expressed as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are integers . and @xmath28 denotes the 0-order reciprocal vector of ppln , @xmath29 is the duty ratio of domain reversal .",
    "@xmath30 denotes the dawson function .",
    "the simulation result is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) under the same condition of experiment and the incident angle of fw @xmath31 . the distribution of sh has the similar pattern with fig .",
    "but the right half was total reflected in experiment . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we can find that , when @xmath32 , the sh intensity @xmath7 gathers in the direction defined by @xmath33 which represent the nonlinear raman - nath diffraction of sum - frequency .",
    "when @xmath34 , sh will radiate at angles satisfied the conditions @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "under the paraxial approximation , the solution of the latter is @xmath36 , which is exactly the longitudinal phase - matching condition of ncr . the corresponding phase - matching geometry is shown in fig .",
    "the emission of 0-order ncr in the experimental pattern is in accordance with the situation in bulk material @xcite . for high - order ncr",
    ", one should take the reciprocal vectors into consideration , which is associated with fourier components of the @xmath3 modulation in terms of quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) along the x - axis .",
    "the nonlinear sum - frequency polarization wave along the reflection interface ( x - y plane ) associating with the reciprocal vectors along the y - axis simulates an effective polarization wave which could emit the high order cerenkov radiation .",
    "the wave vector of nonlinear polarization wave of @xmath27-order ncr has the form as : @xmath37 .",
    "and we can deduce the radiation angle of @xmath27-order ncr along @xmath21 axis : @xmath38 and along @xmath22 axis : @xmath39",
    "to experimentally demonstrate the calculated relationship of n - order ncr angles , we investigate the external angles of different order cerenkov radiations varying with the incident wavelength , with fixed external incident angle of fw @xmath40 .",
    "and with fixed wavelength of fw @xmath41 nm , we measured the relationship between the external emergence angles and the external incident angles .",
    "the experimental results , as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) and fig .",
    "3(b ) , respectively , demonstrate good agreement with theoretical predications . according to the phase - matching condition and the experimental results",
    ", we verify that the polarization wave is always confined along the crystal surface .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the transverse distribution of the nonlinear diffraction along x axis . with external incident angle fixed as @xmath42 , the external angles of the 1st cerenkov radiations varied with the incident wavelength [ fig .",
    "when the wavelength of fw was fixed as 1250 nm , we draw the relationship between diffraction angles and the periods by using several samples with different poling periods , as shown in fig .",
    "the angular position of nonlinear cerenkov diffraction patterns are varying associating with the variance of the samples , which implies the periodical structure are modulating the surface reflecting cerenkov radiation . the transversely spatial distribution ( along x - axis ) of nonlinear cerenkov patterns coincided with nonlinear raman - nath diffraction in 1d nonlinear crystal .        in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we note that each order of ncr has a cutoff angle respectively . at these incident angles , the emission angle of corresponding",
    "order ncr equals to 0 .",
    "the phase - matching condition can be written as @xmath43 , where the polarization wave is collinear with the cerenkov harmonic wave and the phase - mismatch is minimized , so that each order of ncr would be greatly enhanced at these specific angles . in experiment , it s clearly that such enhancement occurred at the beginning of the ncr emergence .",
    "we have experimentally recorded the enhanced 0-order ncr with wavelength at 1250 nm and sample period of 6.92 @xmath44 , as shown in fig.4 ( a ) . in fig .",
    "4(b ) we verify the dependence of the incident angle of the enhanced 0-order ncr as a function of the incident wavelength .",
    "the incident angle increased proportionally with the incident wavelength , which is consistent with theoretical analysis .",
    "so far , we have realized modulating the both diffraction pattern and the emit efficiency of cerenkov diffraction on the crystal surface , which provide more plentiful radiation patterns compared with ncr on bulk crystal surface .",
    "in summary , we theoretically and experimentally demonstrated the @xmath3 modulated nonlinear cerenkov diffraction on the crystal surface .",
    "the sum - frequency polarization wave generated by incident and reflected waves is confined on the crystal surface and modulated by the periodical @xmath3 structure .",
    "the diffraction angle and transverse distribution of the qpm - ncr are investigated experimentally , which shows a good agreement with the theoretical calculation .",
    "in addition , with proper incident angles , the multiple diffraction would be greatly enhanced , which features the ncr emergence .",
    "it s can present more plentiful radiation patterns could be expected in other various @xmath3 structures , such as aperiodic , quasi - periodic , random , chirp , two - dimensional or other desirable patterns .",
    "further , making appropriate artificial structures on the crystal surface would allow us to control the behavior of harmonic generation more efficiently .",
