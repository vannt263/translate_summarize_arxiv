    "the investigation of directed and reversed net transport in systems lacking reflection symmetry , i.e. in _ ratchets _ , in the presence of deterministic or stochastic forces with time averages of zero has been a fascinating topic of research over the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "the originally mechanical ratchet scenario  @xcite was successfully adopted in biology while studying molecular motors  @xcite and has been exploited in many other areas of science and engineering .",
    "for instance , directed net transport has been experimentally observed in the motion of colloidal particles  @xcite , in superconducting quantum interference devices  @xcite , josephson junctions  @xcite , cold atoms  @xcite , and in the driven motion of domain walls in asymmetrically patterned magnetic films  @xcite . besides , one often deals with the ratchet effect when investigating stepper motors  @xcite and other mode - locking  @xcite and synchronization  @xcite phenomena .    among different types of ratchet systems ,",
    "the superconducting abrikosov vortex ratchets  ( vrs )  @xcite have gained especial attention .",
    "in essence , the vr is a system where the vortex can acquire a net motion whose direction is determined only by the asymmetry of the periodic pinning potential .",
    "the asymmetry of the potential refers to the current direction reversal .",
    "initially , the vr effect has been proposed for driving fluxons out of superconductors  @xcite and for constructing flux pumps and lenses  @xcite .",
    "later on , it has been observed by magneto - optical imaging  @xcite .",
    "most commonly , vrs have been used for modifying the magneto - resistive response of nanostructured superconductors  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , along with the vortex guiding effect the vr effect represents one of the two most important phenomena  @xcite stipulating the modern field of research and technology known as _",
    "fluxonics_. similar to the manipulation of electrons in micro- and nano - electronics , fluxonics is based upon the manipulation of flux - line vortices in superconductors , usually by making use of artificially fabricated pinning nanolandscapes .",
    "an even more intriguing phenomenon in the vr dynamics is the switching effect between direct and reversed net motion , also known as the _ ratchet reversal _ effect .",
    "experimentally , a sign change in the rectified voltage as a function of an ac driving force has been widely reported  @xcite .",
    "also , a reversal of the current of particles has been observed in an optical ratchet  @xcite . for explaining the vr reversal",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed .",
    "these include the presence of interstitial vortices  @xcite , a reconfiguration of the vortex lattice at different drive and field values  @xcite , the competition of the characteristic vortex - vortex interaction length scale with the period of an asymmetric pinning landscape  @xcite , the inertia effect  @xcite , the interaction between vortices within pinning centers  @xcite , and the coexistence of pinned and interstitial vortices moving in opposite directions  @xcite . at the same time , it has been shown that vr reversals can also occur when interstitial vortices are absent  @xcite .    to experimentally investigate the vr dynamics ,",
    "different approaches have been used for tailoring the pinning in an asymmetric fashion .",
    "this is achieved , e.g. , by using pinning sites of different sizes  @xcite and shapes , such as triangles  @xcite , grading circles  @xcite , and arrow - shaped wedged cages  @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting pinning potential in such structures is rather complex and does not allow for a full and exact theoretical description of the vortex flow at any arbitrary angle with respect to the guiding direction of the potential , as a function of all driving parameters of the problem .",
    "at the same time , this complexity is absent for a more simple type of an asymmetric periodic pinning potential  the washboard pinning potential ( wpp ) .",
    "it is worth noting that already in 1970 morrison and rose  @xcite used in ",
    "bi foils imprinted with a diffraction grating providing an asymmetric wpp landscape . though the investigation of the vr effect was beyond the scope of their work  @xcite , the critical current anisotropy caused by to the guiding of vortices along the imprinted channels was clearly seen .    among state - of - the - art nanofabrication methods suitable for an accurate realization of the wpp used in this work [ see below equation  ] two advanced mask - less techniques should be mentioned .",
    "first , the direct nano - writing by focused ion beam milling  @xcite allows one to fabricate nanogroove arrays  @xcite inducing a wpp in processed films by vortex length reduction and order parameter suppression .",
    "second , a complementary nanofabrication tool , focused electron beam - induced deposition  @xcite of the metal - organic precursor @xmath0 can be used for furnishing the surface of superconducting films with an array of ferromagnetic @xmath1 strips  @xcite such that a wpp is provided that influences the vortex motion .",
    "both techniques allow one to fabricate carefully designed nanopatterns in which an asymmetry of the induced wpp is achieved by pre - defining the left and right groove or strip slopes steepness differently  @xcite . as for the terminology used throughout this paper",
    ", we will use the notions _ steep - slope _ and _ gentle - slope _ wpp directions for referring to the _ hard _ and the _ easy _ direction for the vortex motion , respectively .",
    "these are sketched in figure  [ f04tasys ] .",
    "a considerable amount of theoretical work about the general properties of different types of ratchet systems exists  @xcite . depending on the way to bring asymmetry into a system",
    ", one can distinguish between the fixed _",
    "intrinsic _ asymmetry , i.e. , that caused by the spatial asymmetry of the potential , and the tunable _ extrinsic _ asymmetry , usually invoked by an external dc bias .",
    "a vr with internal pinning asymmetry is called a _ rocking ratchet_. in an earlier work  @xcite , we have studied this case in the limit of non - interacting vortices , i.e. , in the _ single - vortex approximation _ for an asymmetric saw - tooth wpp .",
    "a vr with external pinning asymmetry is known as a tilted - potential or _",
    "tilting ratchet_. previously , also this case has been considered  @xcite for a cosine wpp in the presence of a dc current . in  @xcite ,",
    "the exact expressions for the experimentally accessible values being the dc ratchet voltage and the absorbed ac power have been derived by using the _ matrix continued fractions _",
    "technique  @xcite . in the present work our objective is to substantially generalize these two studies  @xcite and to theoretically investigate a rocking vr subject to superimposed ( dc+ac ) stimuli .",
    "the analytical treatment of the problem is performed with the help of the matrix continued fraction method which will be extended for an asymmetric wpp , although all expressions become more complicated than in the case of a cosine potential .     is associated with the wpp channels which are parallel to @xmath2 indicating the guiding direction of the wpp .",
    "the coordinate system @xmath3 is associated with the direction of the transport current density vector @xmath4 directed at the angle @xmath5 with respect to the @xmath6 axis .",
    "@xmath7 is the magnetic field and @xmath8 is the lorenz force for a vortex .",
    "owing to the average pinning force @xmath9 due to the wpp , the average vortex velocity vector @xmath10 is not perpendicular to @xmath11 .",
    "the sketch is drawn neglecting the hall effect .",
    "the ratchet wpp @xmath12 is shown to indicate the orientation of its steep - slope and gentle - slope directions along the @xmath13 axis .",
    "the modification of the wpp in the presence of a dc bias is detailed in the caption of figure  [ f04tatrp].,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the motivation of our study is the following : firstly , we would like to answer the question whether some new effects arise due to the interplay of the tilt - induced and the intrinsic asymmetry of the wpp .",
    "secondly , we would like to propose an exact analytical description of these effects which have not been theoretically addressed so far .",
    "these effects are ( i )  the  dc ratchet voltage reversal and ( ii )  a  non - monotonic enhancement of the power absorption as a function of dc bias at low frequencies . as will be elucidated below , all these predicted effects",
    "appear due to the competition of the aforementioned asymmetries as the only reason .",
    "this is distinct from other scenarios  @xcite used for explaining the vr reversal effect so far .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ c04tafop ] presents the general formulation of the problem and its solution in terms of a matrix continued fraction .",
    "a graphical analysis of the calculated dependences follows in section  [ c04tagra ] .",
    "the limiting case of low frequencies is considered in section  [ c04taalc ] , with the focus on the scenario of the vr reversal effect .",
    "a general discussion of the obtained results concludes our presentation in section  [ c04tacon ] .",
    "the geometry of the problem is schematically shown in figure  [ f04tasys ] .",
    "our theoretical treatment of this system relies upon the langevin equation for a vortex moving with velocity @xmath10 in a magnetic field @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17  is the unit vector in the @xmath18 direction and @xmath19 ) having the form  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lorentz force , @xmath22 is the magnetic flux quantum , and @xmath23 is the speed of light .",

    "this limiting case of a symmetric wpp has been studied previously  @xcite . in the opposite limiting case of @xmath48 a double - well wpp ensues .",
    "this can also be accounted for within the proposed approach but will be discussed elsewhere . here",
    ", we will focus on the case @xmath49 , as representative for the most commonly  @xcite used ratchet potential .    since the ratchet wpp has no component along the @xmath6 axis the pinning force @xmath50 has only an @xmath13 component @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the dimensionless vortex coordinate .",

    "the actual calculation procedure relying upon the exact matrix continued fraction solution  ( [ e04tamcf ] ) should be commented on . in the calculation , the infinite matrix continued fraction in equation  ( [ e04tamcf ] ) was approximated by a matrix continued fraction of finite order .",

    "the central notion in this discussion will be the critical tilt , as is explained in the caption of figure  [ f04tatrp ] .",
    "if one defines the critical dc bias @xmath206 as that corresponding to the vanishing wpp barrier in figure  [ f04tatrp ] , then it is evident that for the gentle - slope ( left ) wpp barrier the critical dc density @xmath207 is less than @xmath208 for the steep - slope ( right ) wpp barrier .",
    "this feature allows for the rectification of ac signals ( the diode effect ) , provided the ac amplitude satisfies the condition @xmath209 .    the dc ratchet voltage @xmath205 is plotted for a set of dc densities @xmath210 in figure  [ f04taeva ] .",
    "consider first the adiabatic case ( @xmath211 ) in figure  [ f04taeva](a ) .",

    "the overcritical tilts for the gentle - slope wpp direction are not achievable during the negative portion of the ac period and thus , the running vortex state in the gentle - slope ( negative ) direction of the @xmath13 axis is not possible . for this reason @xmath205 is non - negative in the entire parameter range . at the same time",
    ", a zero plateau in @xmath205 is maintained as long as the steep - slope critical current is not reached .",

    "turning now to the intermediate- and high - frequency regimes in figures  [ f04taeva](b ) and  [ f04taeva](c ) we notice that the curves also largely exhibit the phase - locking features discussed previously in  @xcite .",
    "the voltage reversal effect persists at very small tilting biases only while the effect itself is very small .",
    "this is due to the fact that with increasing frequency the vortices tend to oscillate within one and the same wpp well .",
    "this corresponds to the localized vortex state  @xcite . due to this depinning scenario",
    ", the impact of the pinning potential on the vortex dynamics vanishes at very high ac frequencies .",
    "accordingly , the vortex motion becomes less sensitive to the asymmetry of the wpp as the potential itself comes out of play . as a result , intermediate and high frequencies @xmath217 are unfavorable for observing the switching between the direct and reversed net motion in our problem .",
    "the frequency dependence of the dc voltage is shown in figure  [ f04taevw ] .",

    "firstly , a sign change in the ratchet voltage results only for overcritical ac densities with respect to the gentle - slope wpp direction .",
    "this condition is needed for enabling the reversed rectification effect , as the gentle - slope direction of the wpp corresponds to the negative direction of the @xmath13 axis in our problem .",
    "secondly , a ratchet reversal is possible only for those small dc biases for which the internal asymmetry of the wpp is not completely suppressed by the bias - induced external asymmetry .",
    "lastly , the range of @xmath210 for the vr reversal effect to appear is broader in the adiabatic regime .",
    "this is because for reducing the frequency - dependent depinning the ac frequency must be small enough .      before entering the discussion ,",
    "let us recall that two physically different regimes in the vortex motion ensue depending on the driving parameters of the problem .",
    "the first regime is the localized mode when the vortex is oscillating within one wpp well . in the this regime",
    "the pinning forces dominate and the response is weakly dissipative .",
    "this regime ensues at low frequencies @xmath233 ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "by contrast to this , at high frequencies @xmath235 ( @xmath236 ) frictional forces dominate and the response is strongly dissipative .",
    "a treatment of both regimes in terms of simple functions at @xmath237 and @xmath238 can be found , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "the power absorbed per unit volume and averaged over the period of an ac cycle @xmath239 can be written for @xmath240 in accordance with equation   as @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the nonlinear dc and ac amplitude- , frequency- and temperature - dependent impedance . as can be seen from equation  , for analyzing the dependence @xmath243 at at @xmath244",
    "it is sufficient to calculate the ac resistivity @xmath245 .",
    "the results are presented in figures  [ f04tar1a ] and  [ f04tar1w ] .",
    "consider at first the curves in figure  [ f04tar1a ] at @xmath246 corresponding to the adiabatic case .",
    "for subcritical tilts with respect to the steep slope of the wpp , @xmath247 , an absorption threshold occurs in the @xmath248 curves .",
    "its position coincides with the thresholds in the corresponding ratchet voltage curves in figure  [ f04taeva](a ) . at close - to - critical ac amplitudes with respect to the steep slope of the wpp the curves @xmath248",
    "demonstrate a nonlinear transition to unity .",
    "for close - to - critical dc biases @xmath249 a maximum is developing in the curves at subcritical ac amplitudes @xmath250 . for over - critical biases",
    "@xmath251 an enhanced power absorption ensues already for weak ac drives .",
    "the reason for this is that the vortex running state is achieved by the overcritical tilting bias . in the case of intermediate and high frequencies",
    "( not shown ) the curves @xmath252 quickly approach unity as the high - frequency drive shakes the vortex within one and the same wpp well which can be treated as the effective vanishing of the pinning .     versus @xmath190 in the adiabatic regime for a set of dc biases @xmath210 , as indicated.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]     versus @xmath178 at intermediate ac drives for a set of dc biases @xmath210 , as indicated.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    we now turn to the analysis of the frequency dependence of @xmath253 shown in figure  [ f04tar1w ] for close - to - critical ac drives @xmath254 .",
    "we begin with the consideration of a special case @xmath255 .",
    "this curve is interesting as it is a smooth step - like function being in good agreement with the results of coffey and clem  @xcite who calculated in linear approximation in @xmath190 the temperature dependence of the depinning frequency in a nontilted cosine pinning potential .",
    "we note that for @xmath256 the bias @xmath255 is very close to the gentle - slope critical value .",
    "physically this means that this curve corresponds to a virtually complete `` compensation '' of the internal asymmetry by the external bias - induced asymmetry . if one now reduces the bias value , an enhanced absorption results at low frequencies due to the running vortex state owing to the rectification effect in the gentle - slope direction of the wpp . in the opposite case of stronger biases an enhancement of",
    "the absorbed power ensues thanks to the running state caused by the over - critical total ( dc+ac ) densities with respect to the steep - slope direction .",
    "the behavior of @xmath257 for overcritical dc biases is non - monotonic : with increasing @xmath178 peculiarities in the curves become more pronounced and a sharp minimum develops at @xmath258 .",
    "the appearance of this frequency- and temperature - dependent minimum was discussed in more detail in  @xcite . with increasing @xmath210 the minimum shifts towards higher frequencies .    at strong ac drives ( not shown ) @xmath257 acquires large values already at very low frequencies @xmath259 and quickly approaches unity .",
    "the response becomes almostly independent of the dc tilting bias . in the opposite limiting case of small ac drives ( not shown )",
    "@xmath257 replicates the well - known coffey - clem results for all biases up to @xmath249 . summing up",
    ", the variety of nonlinear regimes the vortex ensemble passes through is most rich for intermediate ac drives .",
    "thus , this regime is most favorable for observing both , the non - monotonic dependence of the absorbed ac power at very low frequencies and the dc bias - dependent minimum in @xmath257 at @xmath260 .    up to this point , the following conclusions can be drawn : in the limiting case of virtually `` compensated '' asymmetries the well - known results of coffey and clem at @xmath261 are reproduced  @xcite . at strong dc biases an enhanced power absorption results at low frequencies , having a deep minimum at @xmath258 . at weak dc biases a non - monotonic dependence of @xmath262 on @xmath210 follows . from the analysis above we notice that the predicted effects mainly ensue at low frequencies @xmath263 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the wpp depth and its asymmetry are virtually left intact by the depinning effects which are pronounced at elevated frequencies .",
    "accordingly , more attention to the low - frequency regime will be paid in the next section .",
    "in this section we will consider the physically important limiting case of low frequencies at zero temperature . our objective is to elucidate the scenario of the vr reversal to appear in the problem of question .",
    "this will allow us to supply the exact results discussed so far with a more visual and intuitive interpretation .",
    "it should be noted that the ratchet response at @xmath264 can be calculated with the help of the conventional stationary cvc .",
    "for this reason , at zero temperature , we first consider the cvc for a cosine potential and next derive the cvc for the asymmetric potential given by equation  .",

    "we proceed now to the calculation of the cvc for the asymmetric potential @xmath279 $ ] at zero temperature . in this case",

    "one may notice the difference between the steep - slope and the gentle - slope critical currents due to the asymmetry of the potential .",
    "it can also be shown that the cvc @xmath291 in figure  [ f04taorr](a ) coincides with the dc cvc @xmath292 calculated by equation   in the limit of zero temperature and zero ac frequency .",
    "our objective now is to calculate the dc ratchet response @xmath293 in the presence of a dc bias @xmath294 . for this , one performs the change @xmath295 ( say @xmath286 for definiteness ) . as we are seeking for the average dc ratchet voltage @xmath293 in response to the superimposed stimuli ( @xmath296 ) , one needs to integrate the function @xmath174 over the ac period @xmath297 @xmath298 equation   can be reduced to the sum of two integrals for the positive and negative half - waves of the ac drive .",
    "we perform calculations in the spirit of  @xcite that allows us to take the resulting integrals over the appropriate range of @xmath299 .",
    "this is because of the sign - changing expressions under the radicals in equation  .",
    "the final result for the dc ratchet voltage @xmath300 is shown in figure  [ f04taorr](b ) by the solid line . the exact solution given by equation   for the same bias value @xmath286",
    "is shown by the dashed line .",
    "both curves practically coincide : they have a zero plateau for @xmath301 followed by a minimum with @xmath302 . with further increasing @xmath266",
    "both curves demonstrate a sign reversal , have a maximum and then tend to zero at very large @xmath266 ( not shown ) .    as a generalization of the obtained results , in figure  [ f04tarrw ] we present the entire @xmath303-parameter space at @xmath244 where a vr reversal effect results in the adiabatic regime @xmath246 .",
    "it should be noted that the vr reversal effect is only possible at close - to - critical ac amplitudes and deeply subcritical dc biases , as depicted in figure  [ f04tarrw](a ) .",
    "one can trace that with increasing dc bias @xmath210 the gentle - slope critical current @xmath304 increases , whereas the steep - slope critical current @xmath305 decreases . at @xmath306",
    "the condition @xmath307 is satisfied and for @xmath308 the ( negative ) rectifying effect is no longer possible . from figure",
    "[ f04tarrw](b ) it follows that the reversed net motion ( negative voltage ) ensues in a most wide range of dc biases @xmath309 at @xmath310 . at the same time",
    ", it is evident that the anisotropy parameter @xmath311 should be favored for observing a most sequence of the different regimes in the rectified net motion of vortices .",
    "we have proposed an exactly solvable two - dimensional model structure for the study of the dc voltage response and the absorbed ac power in superconducting films with an asymmetric ( ratchet ) washboard pinning potential subject to superimposed dc and ac stimuli .",
    "we have theoretically examined the strongly nonlinear behavior of these responses as functions of the ( dc+ac ) transport current density @xmath11 , the frequency @xmath27 , the temperature @xmath35 , and the current tilt angle @xmath5 with respect to the guiding direction of the wpp .",
    "it is physically clear that current , temperature , and angle @xmath5 have qualitatively different effects on the weakening of the pinning and the corresponding transition from anisotropic vortex dynamics to isotropic . with increasing @xmath312",
    "the lorentz force @xmath8 grows and the height of the potential barrier decreases , so for @xmath313 these barriers essentially disappear . here",
    "@xmath314 are the crossover currents for these transitions to occur regarding the gentle- and steep - slope wpp barriers . in the absence of a dc bias , @xmath315 owing to the internal asymmetry of the wpp . in the presence of a dc bias ,",
    "this balance is changed depending on the bias value so that the opposite inequality @xmath316 can be achieved .",
    "the intensity of the internal asymmetry defined by the parameter @xmath46 in equation   appears to be tunable in a narrower range as compared to the external bias - caused asymmetry for which even far overcritical tilts of the wpp can be achieved .",
    "accordingly , the reversed net motion due to the internal asymmetry is possible at weak dc biases only , at strong dc biases the direct net transport prevails over the reversed one .    proceeding now to a short description of the main theoretical results , we note that an exact analytical representation of the nonlinear ( dc+ac)-driven responses of the investigated system in terms of a matrix continued fraction was possible thanks to the use of a simple but physically realistic model of anisotropic pinning with an asymmetric wpp .",
    "firstly , the exact solution obtained made it possible to consistently analyze not only the qualitatively clear vortex dynamics of the ratchet reversal effect , but also non - trivial features in the conventional cvc , at any arbitrary values of the driving parameters .",
    "secondly , the proposed model allows one to exactly calculate the nonlinear power absorbtion being usually a non - trivial issue in other models . besides",
    ", it should be stressed that in our model the vr reversal effect unavoidably results when tuning the dc bias from zero up to overcritical values , as the two competing asymmetries having opposite effects on the vortex motion are initially included in the formulation of the problem .    with respect to the experimental verification of the theory , to the best of our knowledge , there has been no direct examination of the predicted effects so far .",
    "however , in connection with our theoretical predictions three recent studies  @xcite on nano - patterned superconductors should be mentioned .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have experimentally investigated the frequency dependence of the dc voltage at large amplitudes of the ac driving force in the frequency range between @xmath317  mhz and @xmath318  ghz .",
    "a strong dependence of the ratchet reversals at frequencies higher than @xmath319  mhz has been reported  @xcite . at lower frequencies ,",
    "their results were virtually frequency - independent , as in the case of  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have reported results of combined dc and microwave electronic measurements of magnetic flux transport in ( sub-)micron patterned high-@xmath320 films .",
    "they have shown that the guided flux motion persists up to @xmath321  ghz , the highest frequency achievable in that experiment . recently",
    ", one of us  @xcite has made electronic transport measurements of the mixed state of epitaxial nb films patterned with a symmetric pinning landscape induced by a nanogroove array .",
    "it has been shown that all anisotropic effects in the two - dimensional vortex dynamics are clearly seen . currently under way",
    "are measurements of the magneto - resistive response of superconductor nb films with a ratchet wpp similar to that presented in  @xcite , with an extension of ac frequencies towards the microwave range . summing up , we consider these systems  @xcite to be most promising for the experimental verification of the results reported here , provided the wpp in such samples is tailored in an asymmetric fashion .",
    "it should be noted that the realization of the regime of strong dc biases involves certain difficulties in experiment . indeed ,",
    "when the critical current density @xmath322 is rather large , the realization of the strongly dissipative mode , in which the flux - flow resistivity @xmath232 can be measured , requires @xmath323 .",
    "this is commonly accompanied by a non - negligible electron overheating in the sample  @xcite which changes the value of the sought @xmath232 .",
    "we note , however , this difficulty can be overcome provided high - speed current sweeps  @xcite or short - pulse measurements  @xcite are employed .    finally , we would like to note that the reported extension of the matrix continued fraction method for an asymmetric periodic potential in the presence of combined ( dc+ac ) stimuli may be useful for the wide class of nonlinear stochastic systems with an asymmetric potential under the action of superimposed constant and alternating drives .",
    "in particular , here we mean charge - density - wave pinning  @xcite , the nonlinear impedance of josephson junctions  @xcite , nonlinear magnetization relaxation  @xcite , stochastic resonance  @xcite , resonance activation  @xcite , and noise enhanced stability  @xcite .",
