    "higher order effects in the perturbative treatment of the electroweak standard model ( sm ) play an active rle both in testing some of its fundamental ingredients and in uncovering phenomena not explained by the standard framework .",
    "one of the peculiarities of the sm is the absence ( at leading order in the perturbative expansion ) of flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "this characteristic feature strongly affects flavour mixing and rare meson decays .    neglecting the tiny cp  violating amplitudes ( as we do in this letter ) the perturbative contributions to @xmath7@xmath8 mixing are straightforward to evaluate in the sm .",
    "however the numerical quantification is affected by our rather poor knowledge of some of the relevant elements of the ckm matrix and of the quark masses . in any case",
    "more dubious is the treatment of long  distance contributions .",
    "these have two main sources : a ) the evaluation of the matrix element of the four  quark @xmath9 operator in the effective hamiltonian ( f is short for flavour ) , and b ) the handling of mesonic intermediate states contributing to the dispersive amplitude .",
    "both features are characterized by a manifestly non  perturbative origin .",
    "the relative importance of short vs. long  distance contributions depends crucially of the flavour involved .",
    "this is so because as the flavour is heavier the transitions involve higher transfer of momenta and therefore non  perturbative corrections are less relevant . as a consequence @xmath10@xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12@xmath13 are expected to be dominated by the perturbative regime .",
    "this is not so clear for @xmath3@xmath4 and definitely not the case of @xmath0@xmath1 ( due to the possible contribution of resonances in the highly populated kinematical region of charmed mesons ) .    in this letter",
    "we address the issue of non  perturbative corrections to the mixing and therefore we will be concerned with these last two cases .    at hadronic level meson mixing with @xmath9 transitions has ushered permanent interest because its implications  : tests of fcnc , close relation with cp  violation , prospects of new physics beyond the sm , etc .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "mixing occurs through radiative corrections in the sm .",
    "the mass eigenstates are @xmath14 \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{eq : p12}\\ ] ] and the mixing produces @xmath15 oscillations of amplitude @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the parameter controlling the oscillation is @xmath18 and @xmath19 . ] and consequently the mass difference between the eigenstates . with our normalization",
    "this mass difference is related with the @xmath9 transition through @xmath20 where @xmath21 is short for the relevant pseudoscalar mass .",
    "@xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath0@xmath1 mixings have notable different features in the sm .",
    "both mixings have a complementary interest because test fcnc in the upper and lower sector of the families , respectively .",
    "experimentally @xcite @xmath22 and @xmath23 and , as we will shortly see , the perturbative evaluation in the sm is able to point out these different behaviours because it predicts @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "moreover the perturbative evaluation gives the right order for the measured @xmath3@xmath4 mixing while it gives a very small @xmath0@xmath1 mixing .",
    "this is the case because gim mechanism @xcite is much more effective in the lower sector of the families than in the upper one due to the quark mass differences .",
    "dispersive amplitudes due to intermediate mesonic states could give relevant non  perturbative contributions .",
    "these have been considered by several authors @xcite and the conclusion is that they indeed are important . in @xmath0@xmath1 could even give a result several orders of magnitude bigger than the perturbative one",
    ". this might be due to the fact that the expected gim suppression could be spoiled by the bad @xmath26 breaking observed in several decays of charmed mesons @xcite .",
    "we have proposed a weak - gauged chiral model up to and including charmed mesons in order to implement at hadronic level all the structure of symmetries of the sm , specifically including the gim mechanism @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath27 chiral symmetry of the strong interactions must be extended to a @xmath28 symmetry in order to implement the weak @xmath29 representations .",
    "nevertheless it must be clear that our model is not pretended to be a model for the strong interaction .",
    "of course chiral symmetry is badly broken in the charm sector .",
    "we expect that this model may provide a realistic approach to those processes where relevant features of the flavour sector of the sm like gim play a significant rle . in this letter",
    "we evaluate in our model @xcite , the leading order result for the @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath0@xmath1 mixings .",
    "in section 2 we remind briefly the perturbative evaluations of the mixings in the sm .",
    "an outline of the basic ingredients of our model is sketched in section 3 .",
    "then in sections 4 and 5 we specify our results for @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath0@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we end with our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the short  distance contribution to meson mixing in the sm is represented by the usual box diagrams . in order to carry out this calculation",
    "one starts with the weak effective hamiltonian @xmath30 in terms of four  quark operators .",
    "we explain both @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath0@xmath1 mixings in turn .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( we are not interested in cp - violation ) including the next - to - leading logarithmic qcd corrections , is given by @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33 with @xmath34 the ckm matrix , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are colour indices and @xmath37 \\ ; \\ ; .",

    "( [ eq : hds2 ] ) @xmath38 carries the information of strong qcd corrections @xcite .",
    "a part of the perturbative uncertainties in order to get a firm prediction we need to do the evaluation of the matrix element of the four  quark operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ops2 ] ) between the asymptotic kaon states .",
    "this , of course , involves the unsolved problem of hadronization and our ignorance is expressed by the @xmath39 parameter defined as @xmath40 where , in the leading logarithmic approximation in the strong coupling , @xmath41 a simple factorization approach and vacuum insertion @xcite gives @xmath42 .",
    "the non - perturbative parameter @xmath43 has been calculated using lattice gauge theories @xcite , @xmath44 expansion @xcite and qcd sum rules @xcite leading to @xmath45 .",
    "the qcd hadron duality approach @xcite favours lower values @xmath46 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( neglecting the contribution of the @xmath47 quark due to the suppression of the relevant ckm matrix elements ) is given by @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 and the four - quark operators are defined as @xmath50 this last operator has no analogous in the @xmath3@xmath4 case and it is due to the non  negligible charm quark mass @xmath51 carried by two of the four external legs of the box diagram .",
    "analogously to the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing the evaluation of the matrix elements of the two four  quark operators involves non  perturbative aspects that , this time , are parameterized by two quantities @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the two operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : opc2 ] ) respectively , and defined to be the unity if factorization and vacuum insertion approximations are used .",
    "corrections to this value are potentially large but are not expected to change the order of magnitude .    at any rate from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hdc2 ] ) we can conclude that @xmath0@xmath1 mixing is suppressed typically by a factor @xmath54 over the @xmath3@xmath4 case .",
    "our lagrangian is @xcite  : @xmath55 where the dots are short for pure gauge boson terms . here",
    "@xmath56 contains the strong interaction between mesons and the couplings of mesons to the gauge bosons .",
    "we have a set of @xmath57 scalar and @xmath57 pseudoscalar fields which we assign to the @xmath58 representation of the chiral @xmath28 group .",
    "we denote the meson matrix by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the scalar and @xmath61 the pseudoscalar matrices of fields .",
    "the explicit expression for the pseudoscalar matrix is    @xmath62    @xmath63    a similar matrix can be written for the scalar mesons .",

    "the @xmath76 matrices are the @xmath77 generators and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the left and right hypercharges",
    ". the matrix @xmath80 will be the cabibbo rotation once the @xmath81 symmetry gets spontaneously broken . with our definitions for @xmath82",
    "we have @xmath83 with @xmath84 the usual pauli matrices and @xmath85 the cabibbo angle .",
    "the charge operator is @xmath86 .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) @xmath87 is the usual lagrangian for the minimal model of higgs of the standard theory .",
    "@xmath88 , finally , is a higgs  mesons coupling term which will give masses to the mesons after the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the weak symmetry . in order to write in a compact form this term",
    "we introduce the usual higgs doublet as a @xmath89 matrix : @xmath90 we consider only the simplest local gauge invariant term    @xmath91    where @xmath80 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : genera ] ) and the most general form of @xmath92 assuming isospin symmetry is @xmath93 @xmath88 breaks explicitly the @xmath94 chiral symmetry . through the spontaneous breaking of the chiral and weak symmetry",
    "the matrices of mesons and higgs get a non ",
    "zero vacuum expectation value @xmath95 therefore from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hm ] ) we get @xmath96 where @xmath97 we note that the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hm ] ) transforms under chiral @xmath94 as the @xmath98 representation and , therefore , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmdef ] ) is similar to the usual explicit breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "some aspects of this model are worth to emphasize :    * the starting point of our ideas is to believe that the symmetries of the standard theory are essential to describe the weak processes of hadrons , and any model for them has to support not only its symmetries but its symmetry breaking patterns too .",
    "our realization with two complete families allows to implement rigorously the structure of the sm at hadronic level . *",
    "the gim mechanism is naturally implemented in our scheme .",
    "therefore we have not flavour changing neutral currents at leading order in the perturbative expansion and in this way the model might presumably be trusted in the study of processes where gim plays a significant rle . *",
    "the model has been tested satisfactorily in the study of non  leptonic d decays into two pseudoscalars @xcite , non  resonant @xmath99 @xcite and also , at one  loop level , in radiative rare kaon decays ( @xmath100 ) @xcite with satisfactory results .",
    "hence we think it is worth to use the model just described in order to study @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath0@xmath1 mixings .",
    "we have already seen in section 2 that the short  distance contribution to @xmath3@xmath4 mixing is dominated by the charm degree of freedom while the strange quark dominates @xmath0@xmath1 mixing .",
    "our model provides these ingredients and , moreover , allows the evaluation of long  distance dispersive contributions mediated by the pseudoscalar ( and maybe scalar ) mesons",
    ".    therefore we proceed to calculate them at @xmath101 in the weak perturbation expansion . due to our ignorance on the scalar masses and in order to present simplified analytical expressions , we first analyze the case in which @xmath102 , that is @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) but with @xmath104 constant in order to keep the @xmath105 mass finite . in this case @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efes ] ) is @xmath107 \\ ; \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : fexp}\\ ] ] with @xmath108 with our normalization @xmath109 in the chiral limit .",
    "using this expansion , at leading order , we get a relation between the pseudoscalar masses , @xmath110 eq .  ( [ eq : fexp ] ) is a crude approximation for the charm sector , we must remember here that @xmath28 is not a symmetry for the strong interaction in nature .",
    "therefore we have also considered the case of finite scalar masses in both calculations where one goes beyond the rough approximation represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fexp ] ) and ( [ eq : massre ] ) .",
    "we use the renormalizable @xmath111 gauge @xcite where there is no mixing meson  w and instead we have a meson  charged higgs and meson mixings as shown in fig . 1 .    at this order the two different topologies of feynman diagram contributions to the mixing are those in fig .",
    "1 . both diagrams are separately finite but only the sum of the two is gauge independent .",
    "in order to test the model we can calculate @xmath5 . the problem of evaluating long  distance contributions to the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing has been addressed extensively in the bibliography @xcite .",
    "these are due to intermediate hadronic states in the oscillation and are presumably dominated by the octet of pseudoscalars : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , etc .",
    "an estimate of these contributions gives results comparable with the experimental mass difference .",
    "however the evaluation has significant uncertainties .",

    "several comments are in order about our result eq .",
    "( [ eq : mkmod ] ) :    * our result is finite and only depends on the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons and the meson decay constants once the mass expansion induced by the assumption @xmath119 is carried out .",
    "* we can easily see the effect of the gim cancellation ( in the @xmath120 limit @xmath121 ) by inputting @xmath122 and @xmath123 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mkmod ] ) that gives evidently @xmath124 . * from the observation that the short  distance contribution to @xmath5 scales with @xmath125 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hds2 ] ) one should expect in our model that our result for @xmath5 might scale like @xmath126 . however using the mass relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : massre ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mkmod ] ) we see that the term in @xmath126 cancels .",
    "this fact provides a further suppression beyond gim mechanism .    using the mass relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : massre ] ) and expanding the logarithms in turn the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mkmod ] ) can be written as @xmath127 where @xmath128 and our result gives @xmath129 providing a tiny @xmath130 correction to the leading term . using the values of the decay constants and masses of @xcite",
    "we get @xmath131 inputting the experimental result for @xmath132 @xcite we predict @xmath133 .",
    "our results are in rather good agreement with the experimental figure @xcite @xmath134    this fact can be understood because the dispersive part of the amplitude is dominated by the @xmath135 transitions and , therefore , through the @xmath136 amplitude @xcite that is well recovered in our model .",
    "one could also consider the corrections coming from finite scalar masses . these happen to depend only on two parameters  : @xmath137 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efes ] ) and @xmath138 related to the masses of the mesons @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "this dependence is showed in fig .",
    "2 . inside reasonable values of these parameters",
    "our prediction @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reskm ] ) could only be modified in a factor 2 .",
    "we can conclude that the model gives reasonable values for @xmath5 , in the range @xmath141 .",
    "as has been noted previously in section 2 the short  distance contribution to the @xmath0@xmath1 mixing is very much suppressed relatively to the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing , roughly a factor @xmath142 .",
    "a careful evaluation shows that the suppression is not that much but in any case the perturbative contribution gives @xmath143 the study of long  distance contributions to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing has been considered previously @xcite with very different conclusions . while wolfenstein @xcite , donoghue et al .",
    "@xcite and kaeding @xcite conclude that the dispersive non  perturbative contribution to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing might be huge at the level of providing @xmath144 due to the fact that there is a strong @xmath26 breaking that overcomes the gim suppression , georgi @xcite using arguments of a heavy quark expansion concludes that this is unlikely , and a careful study in this framework @xcite seems to confirm this assessment .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath145 at leading order in our model goes again through the corresponding feynman diagrams in fig .",

    "( [ eq : scatwo ] ) .",
    "again we find a finite result in terms of the pseudoscalar masses and the meson decay constants",
    ". moreover gim suppression ( for exact @xmath150 symmetry , @xmath151 ) is translated now into the meson language as @xmath152 and @xmath153 that gives @xmath154 .",
    "using the mass relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : massre ] ) and expanding over the charmed meson mass we have : @xmath155 with @xmath156 carrying the contribution of higher order in @xmath157 . as we see the @xmath145 scales with the mass of the kaon to the fourth over the mass of the charmed meson .",
    "we notice that our result implies a suppression @xmath158 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdsimp ] ) we predict @xmath159 and with the experimental @xmath160 @xcite we have @xmath161 .",
    "there is only an experimental upper limit on @xmath145 @xcite @xmath162 that is four orders of magnitude bigger than our result .",
    "-4 cm    however , there are many dynamical effects in the energy region of @xmath163 which could influence the final states in @xmath164 decays and then modify our prediction .",
    "analogously to the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing we can give an estimate of the dependence of @xmath145 on the masses of the scalar mesons ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in this case",
    "the dependence is bigger than in @xmath5 but for reasonable values of @xmath137 and @xmath138 there is no change in the order of magnitude estimate .",
    "moreover we notice that the sign of @xmath145 could be changed due to the contribution of the scalar mesons .",
    "we think that , in the sm , a bigger order of magnitude for the @xmath0@xmath1 mixing than our result implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmdmod ] ) could only be expected through a large @xmath150 breaking possibly induced by final  state interactions generated through vector meson resonances .",
    "this effect we know it is important in non  leptonic decays of charmed mesons @xcite and therefore could be relevant in the @xmath0@xmath1 mixing .",
    "however , it can be expected a cancellation in the total contribution of the vector mesons due to the gim mechanism .",
    "actually we expect , from these new intermediate channels , contributions without changing noticeably the order of magnitude .",
    "once incorporated all the contributions , the final  state interactions correspond to a unitarity transformation and then it is not expected a modification in the mixing .    a result for @xmath145 as given by our prediction in eq .",
