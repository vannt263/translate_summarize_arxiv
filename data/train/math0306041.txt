    "we consider @xmath0 diffeomorphisms on riemannian surfaces . our goal is to study the hyperbolic properties of a class of maps exhibiting a homoclinic tangency associated to a fixed saddle point @xmath1 , as in figure [ map ] .",
    "homoclinic tangencies inside the limit set , width=226 ]    we assume without loss of generality that we are working on @xmath2 and in the standard euclidean norm .",
    "we recall that a compact invariant set @xmath3 is * uniformly hyperbolic * if there exist constants @xmath4 and a continuous , @xmath5-invariant , decomposition @xmath6 of the tangent bundle over @xmath7 such that for all @xmath8 and all @xmath9 we have @xmath10 by standard hyperbolic theory , every point @xmath11 in @xmath7 has stable and unstable manifolds @xmath12 tangent to the subspaces @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , and thus in particular _ transversal _ to each other .",
    "the presence of the tangency therefore implies that the dynamics on @xmath15 can not be uniformly hyperbolic .",
    "we emphasize at this point that , in the case we are considering , the homoclinic tangency is accumulated by transverse homoclinic orbits which in turn are accumulated by periodic points .",
    "thus it constitutes an intrinsic obstruction to uniform hyperbolicity which can not be resolved by simply ignoring the orbit of tangency .",
    "most of the classical theory of homoclinic bifurcations for diffeomorphisms ( see @xcite and references therein ) considers the unfolding of homoclinic tangencies _ external _ to the set @xmath7 to which they are associated , thus causing no real issues with the hyperbolicity at the bifurcation parameter .",
    "the main goal of such a theory has often been to study the hyperbolicity and the occurrence of tangencies in a neighbourhood of the orbit of tangency _ after _ the bifurcation .",
    "the presence of an internal tangency gives rise to a more subtle situation and it has only recently been shown that this can actually occur as a _ first bifurcation _",
    "part of the motivation of the present paper is to study the global dynamics and hyperbolicity _ at this bifurcation parameter_.      another part of the motivation for this result is to give an example of a compact invariant set which is as `` uniformly '' hyperbolic as possible in the ergodic theory sense , but still not uniformly hyperbolic . to formulate this result precisely ,",
    "let @xmath16 denote the set of all @xmath17-invariant probability measures @xmath18 on @xmath7 . by the classical multiplicative ergodic theorem of oseledet s",
    "there is a well defined set @xmath19 of _ lyapunov exponents _ associated to the measure @xmath18 , we give the precise definitions below .",
    "we say that the measure @xmath20 is _ hyperbolic _ if all the lyapunov exponents are non - zero .",
    "the existence of an invariant measure with non - zero lyapunov exponents indicates a minimum degree of hyperbolicity in the system .",
    "a stronger requirement is that all invariant measures @xmath18 are hyperbolic and of course an even stronger requirement is that they are all `` uniformly '' hyperbolic in the sense that all lyapunov exponents are uniformly bounded away from 0 .",
    "this condition is clearly satisfied for uniformly hyperbolic systems but , as we show in this paper , it is strictly weaker .",
    "the class of examples we are interested in were first introduced in @xcite and constitute perhaps the simplest situation in which an internal tangency can occur as a first bifurcation . in section [ maps ]",
    "we give the precise definition of this class .",
    "for this class we shall then prove the following    all lyapunov exponents of all measures in @xmath21 are uniformly bounded away from zero .",
    "as an immediate corollary we have the following statement which is in itself non - trivial and already remarkable .    @xmath22 is uniformly hyperbolic on periodic points .",
    "we recall that uniform hyperbolicity on periodic points means that there exists constants @xmath23 such that for each periodic point @xmath24 of period @xmath25 , the derivative @xmath26 has two distinct real eigenvalues @xmath27 with @xmath28 notice that the bounds for the eigenvalues are exponential in @xmath29 .",
    "as far as we know this is the first known example of this kind , although it is possible , and indeed even likely , that such a property should hold for more complex examples such as benedicks - carleson and mora - viana parameters in hnon - like families @xcite and horseshoes at the boundary of the uniform hyperbolicity domain of the hnon family .",
    "the weaker result on the uniform hyperbolicity of periodic points has been proved recently for both cases in @xcite and @xcite respectively . .",
    "other known examples of non - uniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms include cases in which the lack of uniformity comes from the presence of `` neutral '' fixed or periodic points .",
    "in these cases , the dirac-@xmath30 measures on such periodic orbits are invariant and have a zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "it is interesting to view our result in the light of some recent work which appears to go in the opposite direction : if a compact invariant set @xmath31 admits an invariant splitting @xmath32 such that , for a total measure set of points @xmath33 , the lyapunov exponents are positive in @xmath34 and negative in @xmath35 , then @xmath31 is uniformly hyperbolic , @xcite . here",
    ", the lyapunov exponents are not even required to be uniformly bounded away from zero .",
    "thus the existence of at least one orbit as which the splitting degenerates is a necessary condition for a situation such as the one we are considering , in which the lypaunov exponents are all non - zero but @xmath7 is strictly not uniformly hyperbolic .",
    "the concept of uniform hyperbolicity of the periodic points and of measures plays an important role in the general theory of one - dimensional dynamics . in some situations , such as for certainclasses of smooth non - uniformly expanding unimodal maps these notions",
    "have been been shown to be equivalent to each other and to various other properties usually associated to uniform hyperbolicity such as exponential decay of correlations @xcite .",
    "higher dimensional cases are generally much harder due to the complexity of the geometrical and dynamical structure of the examples and progress is only starting to be made .      after defining the class of systems of interest in section [ maps ] , in section [ splitting ] we construct a field of cones which are invariant under the derivative map . in section [ periodicpoints ]",
    "we show that some * non - uniform hyperbolicity * is satisfied off the orbit of tangency : the expanding and contracting directions of points which are very close to the orbit of tangency are almost aligned and therefore the contraction and/or expansion may take arbitrarily long time to become effective .",
    "we formalize this by saying that there exists a constant @xmath36 , _ depending on the point _",
    "@xmath11 ( compare with ) , such that for all @xmath11 not in the orbit of tangency we have @xmath37 with @xmath38 arbitrarily small near the points of the orbit of tangency , i.e. @xmath39 one way to show that the non - uniformity is not too extreme is to show that there is a _ uniformly hyperbolic core _ in the following sense : there exists a region @xmath40 containing one point of the orbit of tangency , and there exists constants @xmath23 such that , for each point @xmath41 that returns to @xmath40 at the @xmath42-th iterate , we have @xmath43 in fact , we show that this uniform hyperbolicity occurs well before the return of the orbit of @xmath44 to @xmath40 .",
    "those exponential estimates are valid from the moment that the orbit of @xmath44 leaves a certain neighborhood of the fixed point @xmath1 , and they keep working as long as the orbit wanders around @xmath45 . finally , in section [ lyapunov ] we show that this implies the statement of our main theorem .",
    "we start with a geometrical definition of the class of maps under consideration .",
    "let @xmath46 be a @xmath47 diffeomorphism and let @xmath48\\times [ 0,1 ] $ ] denote the unit square in @xmath49 .",
    "we suppose that there exist 5 `` horizontal '' regions in @xmath50 which are mapped as in figure [ the map ] : @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "the map @xmath53,width=340 ]    we suppose that regions @xmath54 are mapped affinely to their images , with derivative @xmath55 in @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively , for two constants @xmath58 satisfying @xmath59 and @xmath60 . more explicitly we suppose that @xmath61 in in @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 in @xmath57 ( @xmath65 ) and that @xmath66 is a vertical strip parallel to @xmath67 .",
    "in particular there is a hyperbolic fixed point at the origin @xmath68 whose stable and unstable manifolds contain the lower and left hand side of the square @xmath50 respectively .",
    "we emphasize that the explicit nature of the map in these regions is for simplicity only , and to allow us to concentrate on the strategy for dealing with the tangency .",
    "this could be weakened significantly , for example by assuming only some uniformly hyperbolic structure in regions @xmath69 .",
    "region @xmath70 is mapped outside the square @xmath50 and thus we do not need to make any particular assumption on its form .",
    "region 4 is mapped to a `` fold '' @xmath71 which contains a point of the orbit of tangency .",
    "here we make some `` non - degeneracy assumptions '' essentially stating that vertical lines in @xmath72 are mapped to non - degenerate parabolas .",
    "more precisely , we suppose that there is a region @xmath73 bounded by two disjoint curves so that points in @xmath74 , are mapped inside region @xmath75 with second coordinate greater than @xmath76 .",
    "then , for each @xmath77 in @xmath78 $ ] we have that @xmath79 is contained in the graph of the map @xmath80 for some fixed @xmath81 and some @xmath82 .",
    "thus all vertical lines in @xmath83 are mapped to parabolas with constant curvature @xmath84 .",
    "again , this could be weakened significantly although we do assume for less trivial reasons that the curvature @xmath84 is sufficiently large in relation to the constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "notice that the point @xmath87 is a point of tangency of the stable and unstable manifolds of the fixed point at the origin . to control the global properties of the family of parabolas we also assume that @xmath88 and that , for every @xmath89 , @xmath90 a completely explicit example of a map @xmath17 satisfying all these conditions is given in @xcite .",
    "we now define the limit set @xmath91 it follows from the construction that @xmath3 is non empty and contains ( at least ) one orbit of tangency between stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "our assumptions make it easy to control the dynamics in regions @xmath69 and therefore our main objective is to control the dynamics of points returning to the fold @xmath92 and to a neighbourhood of the tangency .",
    "thus we concentrate on the _ first return map _ from @xmath93 to itself and show that this map satisfies some strong hyperbolicity estimates from which we can deduce our main estimate on the hyperbolicity of periodic points .",
    "consider the foliation @xmath94 , of @xmath95 , whose leaves are images of vertical lines by the map @xmath96 ( in @xmath97 , the leaves are parabolas ) .",
    "to each point @xmath98 we associate the tangent direction , @xmath99 , to the leaf of @xmath94 which passes through @xmath98 , at this point ( @xmath99 is parallel to @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath101 be the angle between @xmath99 and the horizontal .",
    "there is only one point for which @xmath102 and this is the point of tangency @xmath103 .",
    "at all other points we have with @xmath104 . then , we divide @xmath7 into 3 regions , according to the value of @xmath105 : @xmath106 notice that @xmath107    for each point @xmath108 we define a _ cone _",
    "@xmath109 of vectors in the tangent space @xmath110 as follows : let @xmath111 , and @xmath112 for any integer @xmath113 .",
    "all cones will be centered on the vertical and , for convenience , we define a _ standard cone _ @xmath114 for @xmath115 in @xmath116 we simply let @xmath117 . for @xmath118 , we define cones which extend to each side of the vertical by three times the ( cotangent of the ) angle of the line @xmath119 defined above . more precisely , recall that @xmath120 is tangent to the graph of @xmath121 , see , and therefore @xmath122 .",
    "then we let @xmath123 before defining the cones in the remaining points in @xmath124 we show that the conefield defined above in @xmath125 is invariant under the first return map to @xmath125 .",
    "as a first step towards proving this invariance we estimate the first return time .",
    "[ return ] consider @xmath126 , and @xmath127 the smallest positive integer such that @xmath128 .",
    "then @xmath129    note that , since @xmath130 , we have @xmath131 , provided that @xmath132 .",
    "in fact , the images @xmath133 of the point @xmath115 will stay in region @xmath134 while @xmath113 is such that @xmath135 . since @xmath136 , there must be at least one more linear iterate of @xmath133 before its orbit visits the pre - image of @xmath137 .",
    "so , we have @xmath138 .",
    "analogously , using the inverse map , we have @xmath139",
    ".    we shall show below that these estimates mean that cones are sufficiently contracted before returning , guaranteeing that they are mapped back strictly into existing cones even if they started out very wide . in particular we shall use the following simple    [ returncor ] consider @xmath126 , and @xmath127 the smaller positive integer such that @xmath128 .",
    "then for this @xmath127 we have @xmath140 and @xmath141    the first inequality follows from which gives @xmath142 the second follows also by by a similar straightforward calculation .",
    "we are now ready to prove the invariance of the conefield for the first return map .",
    "[ inclusion ] there exists @xmath143 such that , if @xmath144 in the definition of @xmath96 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 is the first positive iterate of @xmath115 in @xmath147 , then @xmath148    since @xmath149 is centered in the vertical line , we have , after applying @xmath150 to the vectors of @xmath151 , that @xmath152 is a cone centered in the vertical line at the point @xmath153 whose width is @xmath154 times the width of @xmath151 . after applying @xmath155 to this cone , since @xmath136 , we obtain a cone centered in @xmath156 with width smaller than @xmath157 times the original width .",
    "there are many cases to be considered depending on the location of @xmath115 and @xmath146 in @xmath147 . here",
    "we present the case where @xmath115 and @xmath146 are both in @xmath158 .",
    "the other cases are made following the same steps .",
    "let @xmath115 and @xmath146 be in @xmath158 .",
    "then @xmath159 and @xmath160 since @xmath161 , it satisfies @xmath162 this implies that a cone centered in @xmath163 with width @xmath164 will be properly contained in @xmath165 .",
    "then , in order to obtain @xmath166 we need @xmath167 or , equivalently , @xmath168 we now distinguish two cases . in the case",
    "where @xmath169 we have @xmath170 and therefore it is enough to show that @xmath171 . by this",
    "follows as long as we have @xmath172 for all @xmath173 ( remember that we are working with points of @xmath78\\times[0,1]$ ] ) .",
    "since @xmath174 is fixed and negative , the condition holds if @xmath175 is big enough .    in the case",
    "where @xmath176 we argue in the same way and , using , reduce the problem to showing that @xmath177 for any @xmath178 .",
    "again this follows as long as @xmath84 is sufficiently large .",
    "the other cases follow analogously .",
    "we can now extend the conefield to the set @xmath179 , in a natural way by considering the images of of all cones in @xmath125 and taking slightly wider cones at each point . in this way we obtain a conefield defined at every point outside the orbit of tangency such that @xmath180 for every point @xmath181 . notice that these cones can be arbitrarily wide close to the orbit of tangency . for points",
