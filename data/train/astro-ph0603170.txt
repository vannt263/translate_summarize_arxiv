    "an adaptive optics system senses phase aberrations arising from atmospheric turbulence using observations of a guide star , and compensates these aberrations by applying a correction to an adaptive mirror .",
    "this compensation is valid in the direction of the guide star , but degrades with angular offset from the guide star due to anisoplanatism .",
    "this effect arises due to the shearing between the columns of turbulent atmosphere traversed by light from the guide star and light from a target at a finite angular offset .",
    "the phase aberrations that arise from anisoplanatism depend on a number of parameters .",
    "the errors grows with angular offset from the reference source , so that image quality and strehl ratio degrade with increasing angular offset .",
    "the vertical distribution of turbulence has a strong effect on the degree of error , with higher altitude turbulence generating larger errors due to the larger geometrical shear .",
    "this dependence varies in time as the distribution of atmospheric turbulence over the telescope evolves .",
    "the anisoplanatic error grows with zenith angle , since one sees more turbulence along line of sight to the object .",
    "the error is also a strong function of aperture diameter and observing wavelength .",
    "this large number of dependencies yields a rich phenomenology for the adaptive optics point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the parameter space is so large that it is not practical to integrate long enough to attain the stochastically averaged psf .",
    "the variability in the adaptive optics psf is a serious impediment to the quantitative interpretation of observations , and can limit the precision in astronomical applications involving photometry , astrometry , crowded field imaging , and high dynamic range imaging of extended objects .",
    "integral field unit spectroscopy of extended objects is another application in which the dynamic range of observations may be seriously compromised by psf variability .",
    "multiconjugate @xcite and multiobject @xcite adaptive optics architectures have been proposed that aim to directly overcome the effects of anisoplanatism .",
    "these architectures use multiple guide stars distributed over a finite field of view and employ tomographic algorithms to estimate the three dimensional volume of atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the algorithms rely on a knowledge of the angular offsets among the guide stars , and use the statistical correlations induced by these angular offsets in order to effect the turbulence estimation . in this sense , these algorithms employ anisoplanatism in order to overcome the effects of anisoplanatism .",
    "anisoplanatism in a single conjugate adaptive optics system forms the limiting case of this more complex problem . on - sky tests with existing adaptive optics systems can serve an important role in validating our understanding of anisoplanatism and increasing our confidence in the success of tomography .",
    "significant efforts have been directed towards overcoming the effects of anisoplanatism in existing adaptive optics systems .",
    "one line of investigation has aimed to extract estimates of the psf from observed data . for a small target field",
    ", the psf may be assumed to be field independent .",
    "observations of such fields that contain multiple point sources may be deconvolved using a reference psf selected from the data or by solving for the optimal psf during deconvolution .",
    "these approaches have been applied to crowded stellar fields @xcite and planetary objects @xcite . in an effort to calibrate wider fields ,",
    "@xcite measured the effects of anisoplanatism on the psf using observations of crowded fields , and then applied these measurements to other fields of interest .",
    "this type of technique is unable to capture any temporal evolution of the turbulence profile that occurs between the observations .",
    "another approach has employed a parameterized model of the effects of anisoplanatism on the adaptive optics psf , extracting these parameters during the deconvolution procedure @xcite .",
    "the above techniques did not attempt to use any independent information about the turbulence profile in estimating the adaptive optics psf .",
    "other researchers have incorporated such measurements into the psf estimates . computed the structure function due to residual phase aberrations from anisoplanatism , and used this to evaluate the strehl ratio as a function of angular offset from the guide star for different turbulence profiles and aperture diameters . derived an expression for the adaptive optics optical transfer function that captured the depenedencies of anisoplanatism on the above parameters .",
    "these authors carried out 850 nm observations of two binaries with the onera adaptive optics system and used a turbulence profile measured from a balloon flight together with the analytical expression for the otf to predict the binary companion psf .",
    "@xcite performed k band adaptive optics observations of a binary using the alfa adaptive optics system while at the same time measuring the turbulence profile using a scidar instrument .",
    "these authors compared the strehl ratio degradation due to anisoplanatism measured from the binary image data with that expected from the measured turbulence profiles .",
    "these experiments have shown a promising level of agreement between predictions and measurements .",
    "recent work in the area of turbulence monitoring has yielded an automated set of equipment capable of delivering real time estimates of the turbulence profile on minute timescales @xcite .",
    "this equipment is based on the combination of a multi - aperture scintillation sensor ( mass ) @xcite and a differential image motion monitor ( dimm ) @xcite .",
    "this turbulence monitoring equipment is now being used at a number of different sites , and has been employed by the thirty meter telescope project for its site testing program @xcite . as part of this program ,",
    "a set of this equipment has been installed at palomar observatory .",

    "this effect can lead to a situation where the strehl ratio can be higher downwind of the guide star @xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "this wind induced anisoplanatic effect is neglected .",

    "this permits the otf to be written as @xmath17 note that the otf has factored into a term that describes the anisoplanatic errors and a term that describes the residual errors in the direction of the guide star .",
    "a relationship similar to equation [ factored_otf ] was derived by , and represents a very important result .",
    "one may formulate the otf in any direction on the sky from the product of the guide star otf and an anisoplanatic transfer function formed from @xmath18 .",
    "this factorization is of considerable use in the formulation of a practical scheme for evaluating the otf , as discussed below .",
    "prediction of the otf in equation [ factored_otf ] requires an evaluation of the anisoplanatic structure function @xmath19 .",
    "this function may be computed using a semianalytic expression for the piston removed phase covariance on a circular aperture in the presence of komolgorov turbulence @xcite .",

    "the range variable @xmath37 implicitly incorporates the dependence of the covariance on zenith angle , which enters through @xmath25 , @xmath38 , and the range integral itself .",

    "direct evaluation of the resulting expression using equation [ covariance ] yields @xmath42 this result indicates that the anisoplanatic structure function @xmath43 is in fact only a function of @xmath44 , and is therefore stationary over the pupil plane .",
    "this property permits the factorization of the anisoplanatic and guide star otfs shown in equation [ factored_otf ] .    as in the case of the covariance",
    ", @xmath45 depends on observing wavelength , aperture diameter , turbulence profile , zenith angle and angular offset between the guide star and the direction of interest .",
    "examples of the anisoplanatic structure function are shown in figure [ strfn_fig ] for a particular set of these parameters .",
    "equation [ factored_otf ] represents a model for the otf at any point in the field of view .",
    "this quantity is a strong function of many parameters , which enter through both the anisoplanatic structure function @xmath45 and the guide star otf .",
    "these dependencies give rise to the rich morphology in the adaptive optics psf that presents such a challenge in the analysis of adaptive optics observations .    the classic dependence displayed by the adaptive optics",
    "psf is its degradation with increasing angular offset from the guide star .",
    "figure [ aniso_fig ] contains a series of plots that illustrate this behavior for a 5 meter telescope under typical atmospheric turbulence conditions at palomar .",
    "the first plot shows the aperture averaged residual rms optical path difference ( opd ) vs angular offset from the guide star .",
    "these results were computed by evaluating @xmath46^{2}\\right\\rangle$ ] using equation [ covariance ] , and averaging this quantity over the pupil plane .",
    "the opd is found by computing the square root of this result and dividing by @xmath24 .",
    "also shown in this plot is the opd computed from the @xmath40 approximation described in appendix a. even at small angular offsets , significant discrepancies exist between the exact result and the @xmath40 approximation .",
    "consider an idealized adaptive optics system that acts to eliminate all wavefront error in the direction of the guide star , so that @xmath47 . in this case",
    "the otf in equation [ factored_otf ] depends only on the anisoplanatic structure function @xmath45 , which may be evaluated using equation [ aniso_strfn ] .",
    "this allows computation of an otf that incorporates only the effects of anisoplanatism , from which a psf may be evaluated by fourier transformation .",
    "figure [ aniso_fig ] shows the 2.12 @xmath0 m anisoplanatic otf and psf at an angular offset of 20 arcsecs from the guide star , computed using this method .",
    "the psf displays an increase in elongation along the direction to the guide star that is a characteristic of anisoplanatism . at this angular offset ,",
    "the strehl ratio has dropped to 47% due solely to the effects of anisoplanatism .    in the same way",
    ", the anisoplanatic strehl ratio may be computed as a function of angular offset from the guide star .",
    "these results are also plotted in figure [ aniso_fig ] . for comparison ,",
    "the anisoplanatic strehl ratios computed from the marechal approximation are also shown . in this approximation ,",
    "the aperture averaged phase variance computed from the @xmath40 approximation was exponentiated to form an estimate of the anisoplanatic strehl ratio .",
    "the combination of these two approximations significantly underestimates the anisoplanatic strehl ratio computed directly from the anisoplanatic psf .",
    "this approach to evaluating the anisoplanatic otf and psf is illustrative , but the application of equation [ factored_otf ] to observational data requires a treatment of the guide star otf . while significant efforts have been made to estimate the guide star otf using the statistical properties of @xmath48 @xcite , evaluation of equation 5 is considerably simplified if an observation of the guide star may be used in the prediction of the psf elsewhere in the field of view . for this procedure to work , the guide star",
    "must itself be a point source .",
    "this is often the case in adaptive optics observations .",
    "in these circumstances , the guide star psf may be extracted from the observational data and fourier transformed to form the guide star otf that appears in equation [ factored_otf ] .",
    "the anisoplanatic structure function @xmath49 may be evaluated from equation [ aniso_strfn ] for the field point of interest .",
    "the only parameter in equation [ aniso_strfn ] that is not defined by the observation is the turbulence profile , which may be measured using an independent set of equipment .",
    "the product of the observed guide star otf and the anisoplanatic transfer function provides a prediction of the otf at the field point of interest .",
    "fourier transformation of this otf yields a prediction for the psf .",
    "there are no free parameters in this prediction .",
    "to carry out a comparison of the model in equation [ factored_otf ] with ao compensated image data , a set of observations was carried out at palomar observatory on the night of august 20 , 2005 . in this experiment ,",
    "a well separated binary system was chosen and one member of the binary was used as the guide star for the palomar adaptive optics system @xcite on the hale 5 meter telescope .",
    "a sequence of ao compensated near infrared images of the binary system from the pharo infrared camera @xcite and a sequence of turbulence profiles from a set of dimm / mass equipment were acquired contemporaneously . using the methodology presented in section [ theory ] ,",
    "a prediction for the psf of the binary companion was formulated from the observed psf of the guide star , the measured turbulence profiles , and the parameters defined by the observation .",
    "this prediction was then compared directly to the observed images of the binary companion .",
    "this section describes the details of these observations .",
    "turbulence profile measurements were acquired using a dimm / mass unit on loan from the thirty meter telescope project .",
    "the unit itself has been described by @xcite , and consists of a 35 cm robotic telescope that feeds both a dimm and mass instrument .",
    "the methodology employed in deriving turbulence profiles from the combination of dimm and mass measurements is discussed by @xcite and references therein .",
    "the dimm measures the differential motion between images acquired through two adjacent apertures .",
    "this measurement is sensitive to the integrated turbulence profile . a mass unit measures the scintillation index of images acquired through four apertures of different radii .",
    "these measurements are sensitive to the distribution of higher altitude atmospheric turbulence , which gives rise to scintillation .",
    "together these measurements permit an estimate of the turbulence profile at altitudes of 0 , .5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 km . in a comparison of the turbulence strength measured at each of these layers , simultaneous mass and scidar observations on mauna kea",
    "have displayed agreement to a factor of several @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties in the reconstruction of the turbulence profile from mass data is that the procedure is somewhat ill - conditioned , in that simultaneously adjusting the layer altitude and the strength of turbulence can lead to similar scintillation indices .",
    "however , to leading order anisoplanatism displays this same type of covariance ( _ c.f . _ equation a13 ) . in this sense",
    "both anisoplanatism and mass are low resolution atmospheric profilometers .",
    "the dimm / mass at palomar observatory was located 300 meters from the hale 5 m telescope .",
    "this unit was installed on the roof of a building approximately 10 m above ground level .",
    "turbulence profiles were measured about once every 90 seconds throughout the night of august 20th . for the first hour of the experiment , the dimm / mass unit tracked beta drac at @xmath50 .",
    "a half hour gap in coverage occurred between 5:00 and 5:30 ut due to a tracking error experienced by the robotic telescope . from 5:30",
    "ut onwards , the unit recorded images from alpha cep at @xmath51 . for comparison ,",
    "the binary imaged using the ao system was at @xmath52 .",
    "figure [ turbulence_params_fig ] shows the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 computed from these profiles .",
    "both of these parameters display deviations from their means of order a factor of two over the course of the night .",
    "the variability in the turbulence profiles imply a factor of two variation in the rms opd due to anisoplanatism .",
    "this in turn yielded pronounced variability in the strehl ratio of the binary companion that was readily detectable in the ao compensated image data .",
    "adaptive optics observations of the binary system hd164983 + hd164984 were acquired over a three hour period between 4:17 and 7:18 ut .",
    "this binary system has an angular separation of 21  and is oriented at @xmath53 east of north .",
    "the johnson v magnitudes of hd164983 and hd164984 are 7.6 and 7.3 , respectively , and the latter source was used as the guide star for the adaptive optics system .",
    "the 25 arcsec field of view of the pharo camera was used , permitting both binary members to be positioned on the detector simultaneously .",
    "imaging was performed using two narrowband filters : an h2 filter with a central wavelength of 2.123 @xmath0 m and a bandpass of .007 @xmath0 m and an feii filter with a central wavelength of 1.648 @xmath0 m and a bandpass of .03 @xmath0 m .",
    "exposure times of 2.8 seconds and 1.4 seconds were chosen for the h2 and feii observations , respectively .",
    "the resulting stellar images peaked at less than 30% of the detector full well depth , which is well within the linear range of the detector .",
    "images were acquired in a 7 point linear dither pattern , in which the binary was shifted up and down the detector in 4.5  steps .",
    "ten exposures were acquired at each dither position . after culling the data for bad images , a total of 703 exposures at 2.123 @xmath0 m and 384 exposures at 1.648",
    "@xmath0 m remained .",
    "calibration of the image data was carried out in the customary way .",
    "flat field calibration was performed using twilight sky flats .",
    "sky subtraction was performed by forming the median of the dithered exposures and subtracting this median from each exposure . finally , 3.8  subimages centered on each of the two binary members were extracted from each exposure for use in the analysis below .",
    "the angular extent of these subimages was chosen to encompass all residual scattered light .",
    "a prediction of the psf at the location of the binary companion was formulated for each exposure using the method described in section [ theory ] .",
    "each subimage of the guide star was fourier transformed to form the guide star otf .",
    "an anisoplanatic otf was computed for each measured turbulence profile using the observing wavelength , aperture diameter , angular offset to the binary companion , and zenith angle at the time of the measurement . for each adaptive optics exposure ,",
    "an anisoplanatic otf was formed for the time of the exposure by interpolating the anisoplanatic otfs computed for the nearest turbulence profile measurements .",
    "the pointwise product of the guide star otf and the interpolated anisoplanatic otf was formed , and the resulting otf was fourier transformed to generate a psf prediction for the binary companion sampled at the 25 mas pixel scale of the pharo image data .    for each exposure , the strehl ratios of each observed binary member and of the predicted companion psf were calculated . to compute these strehl ratios , an ideal",
    ", diffraction limited psf for the hale 5 m was simulated by forming the pupil plane wavefront , fourier transforming to form the image plane wavefront , and computing the square modulus .",
    "the pupil plane wavefront used in this procedure accounted for the shadows cast by the secondary mirror and the four struts that support it . for each subimage",
    "this diffraction limited psf was normalized to have the same integrated signal , and the strehl ratio was computed as the ratio of the peak value in the image to that of the ideal psf . in these observations",
    "the 2.12 @xmath0 m images were oversampled at 1.7 times nyquist , while the 1.65 @xmath0 m images were oversampled at 1.3 times nyquist .",
    "this oversampling mitigates many of the subtle effects that can arise in computing strehl ratios from image data @xcite .",
    "in addition to the strehl ratio analysis , a direct comparison was carried out between the predicted and observed psfs of the binary companion . because the guide star psf was used in formulating this prediction",
    ", the predicted psf represents the image that would be obtained for a point source with the same brightness as the guide star .",
    "in fact the binary companion has a different brightness , which may be varying in time .",
    "possible sources of such variability include the presence of cirrus clouds during observations or intrinsic photometric variability of the star itself .",
    "in addition , subimages were extracted from the pharo exposures at a specific angular offset .",
    "variations in the binary offset may occur from one exposure to the next , and it is of interest to measure these offsets from the data .",
    "these parameters constitute the differential photometry and astrometry of the binary , and their measurement requires a fit of the predicted companion psf to the observed companion psf .    for this analysis ,",
    "a simple four parameter model was used .",
    "the relationship between an observation of the binary companion @xmath54 and the predicted psf @xmath55 was taken to be @xmath56 here @xmath57 represents the differential amplitude between the two binary members , while @xmath58 and @xmath59 represent the differential angular offsets .",
    "the constant @xmath60 models any differential in the background level of the guide star and companion data , and guarantees that the residuals from the fit have zero mean .",
    "solution of this equation is readily performed using the predicted and observed companion otfs . in otf space , the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath61 induce a phase slope by the shift theorem @xcite .",
    "a @xmath62 merit function is readily formulated in this space , and minimization of this function leads to a simple iterative solution for all four parameters .    the outcome of this fitting procedure permits measurement of the differential astrometry and photometry between binary members .",
    "the overall angular offsets assumed in the subimage extraction were added to the fitted values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 to yield the differential astrometric offset between the binary members .",
    "the differential photometry was computed as the ratio of the total flux of the fitted psf to that of the guide star . because the residuals are zero mean , the total flux of the fitted psf is identical to that of the observed image of the binary companion . at first glance",
    ", the use of the fitted psf appears to provide no advantage over the observed psf .",
    "however , these images were oversampled and their otfs were lowpass filtered to suppress spatial frequencies larger than the cutoff set by the telescope aperture .",
    "this filtering step substantially reduces the noise in the image .",
    "examples of the 2.12 @xmath0 m and 1.65 @xmath0 m observations of the binary members are shown in figure [ obs_fig ] .",
    "these observations were integrated over five sequential exposures , and serve to illustrate the quality of the ao compensation delivered by the palao system . in the particular 14 second observation at 2.12 @xmath0 m shown in this figure ,",
    "the guide star strehl ratio was 51% .",
    "due to the effects of anisoplanatism , the measured strehl ratio of the binary companion was degraded to 28% .",
    "the predicted companion psf computed from the guide star otf and the turbulence profile at the time of this observation is also shown in this figure .",
    "the strehl ratio calculated for the predicted companion psf was 27% .",
    "the level of agreement between measured and predicted companion strehl is a strong indication that the otf model in equation [ factored_otf ] accurately captures the effects of anisoplanatism .",
    "this also implies that the turbulence profiles measured by the dimm / mass equipment and used in this model reflect the true distribution of atmospheric turbulence .",
    "a similar level of agreement is seen for the 7 second observation at 1.65 @xmath0 m shown in the same figure .",
    "figure [ strehl_fig ] shows the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 computed from the measured turbulence profiles that were acquired over the course of the three hour observation .",
    "these parameters have been computed for the zenith angle of the guide star , which varied between 30 and 40 degrees during the observations .",
    "the values of these turbulence parameters display considerable temporal variation .",
    "figure [ strehl_fig ] also shows the time dependence of the strehl ratios at 2.12 @xmath0 m .",
    "these strehl ratios have again been averaged over five sequential exposures .",
    "the measured guide star strehls vary significantly , and show little correlation with the fried parameter .",
    "this suggests that sources of wavefront error other than residual fitting error contributed significantly to the guide star error budget . the measured strehl ratios of the binary companion are also plotted , along with the strehl ratios computed from the predicted companion otf .",
    "as in figure [ obs_fig ] , these predictions are in excellent agreement with the measurements , and are able to track the companion strehl ratio to a few percent despite a factor of two variability in the measured strehl ratio of both the guide star and the companion .",
    "also plotted are the strehl ratios of the binary companion predicted using a traditional error budget approach .",
    "these predictions were generated from the product of the guide star strehl ratio and the anisoplanatic strehl ratio computed using the @xmath40 approximation , as described in section [ aniso_numerical ] .",
    "these predictions fall well below the measurements , as expected from the discrepancies in the anisoplanatic strehl ratio shown in figure [ aniso_fig ] .",
    "lastly , figure [ strehl_fig ] contains a plot of measured vs. predicted 2.12 @xmath0 m and 1.65 @xmath0 m strehl ratios for the binary companion .",
    "this plot again illustrates strong agreement between the measured strehl ratios and those derived using the predicted companion otf .",
    "results from fitting the predicted companion psf to the data are shown in figure [ resid_obs_fig ] for the observations shown in figure [ obs_fig ] .",
    "this figure shows that the prediction of the companion psf slightly overestimates the core and underestimates the wings of the observed psf .",
    "horizontal cuts through the simulated diffraction limited psf display complex morphology arising from light scattered by the four struts supporting the secondary mirror .",
    "the scattered light is most pronounced along the horizontal and vertical axes of the image , which are aligned with the support struts .",
    "horizontal cuts through the residuals indicate that the predicted companion psf agrees with the observations to about 10% accuracy at any point in the image .",
    "stated another way , this psf fitting procedure has improved the dynamic range of the observation by an order of magnitude .",
    "these residuals display two regimes , in which the accuracy of the predictions was limited by different effects . at radii",
    "less than about .5 arcsecs , the residuals were dominated by systematic errors between the model and the observed data .",
    "these systematics may arise from a number of different effects .",
    "the power spectrum of atmospheric turbulence may be non - komolgorov , so that equation [ aniso_strfn ] is only approximately correct .",
    "accuracy in the turbulence profile measurements from the dimm / mass unit may limit the quality of the prediction . finally , nonlinear response or charge diffusion in the infrared detector in pharo may generate differential errors between the measured guide star and companion psfs . at an angular separation of about .5 arcsecs",

    "this noise floor is set by a combination of the detector read noise , shot noise and quantization noise in the analog to digital conversion .",

    "the value of the residual intensity was 3 to 4 orders of magnitude less than the peak of the measured companion .",
    "this level of psf rejection is comparable to that achieved in near infrared ao observations that employ a lyot coronograph .",
    "these systems provide about 4 to 5 orders of magnitude rejection at an offset of 1  from a star @xcite . in comparing lyot coronography to this fitting technique",
    ", a disadvantage of the latter is that it requires the use of another star to serve as the psf reference . on the other hand ,",

    "all of these observations employed broader filters and lower total integration times than were used in this experiment .",
    "relative to seeing limited observations , the sensitivity gains provided by adaptive optics have afforded this level of photometric stability at much lower flux levels , allowing observations of fainter targets .",

    "these values are somewhat larger than those measured from the astrometric data , which appear in columns 3 and 4 of table 1 .",
    "the discrepancy likely arises from the finite integration time of the exposures .",
    "assuming a characteristic wind speed of 5 m / s , these integration times are comparable to the wind crossing time for the 5 meter aperture , suggesting that tilt jitter has partially averaged away .",

    "this instrument has a limiting magnitude of about 6 due to the 40 cm size of its apertures .",
    "the steps program on the hale 5 m telescope at palomar has achieved astrometric accuracies of less than 1 mas using seeing limited observations in the visible .",
    "these observations employed a 2 arcminute field of view and imaged crowded fields so as to establish an astrometric reference grid from the multiple objects in the field .",
    "both of these techniques employ much broader filters than were used in the observations reported here .",
    "further experiments will be required to understand the circumstances under which the astrometric technique described in section [ data_analysis ] is competitive with these other methods .",
    "generally speaking , the sensitivity improvements afforded by adaptive optics on a 5 meter aperture will permit application of this methodology to fainter limiting magnitudes than are accessible with pti or steps , substantially increasing the number of accessible targets .",
    "differential atmospheric tilt jitter scales as @xmath73 , and application of this technique on a larger aperture telescope will reduce this jitter while at the same time increasing the signal to noise ratio and decreasing the width of the psf core .",
    "this would provide substantial improvements on the astrometric accuracies that have been reported in this experiment .",
    "the research presented here has drawn together a number of different elements in order to generate predictions of the adaptive optics psf .",
    "factorization of the otf in equation [ factored_otf ] permits one to use the guide star psf as a reference for observations throughout the field of view .",
    "this psf encapsulates the complex behavior of the adaptive optics system that is otherwise very difficult to model .",
    "the covariance expression in equation [ covariance ] provides an analytic formulation that captures the dependencies of anisoplanatism on aperture diameter , observing wavelength , turbulence profile , angular offset and zenith angle .",
    "measurements of the turbulence profiles from the dimm / mass equipment provide the one input parameter for these predictions that is not determined directly from the observations .",
    "these three elements provide a methodology for adaptive optics psf prediction that is accessible to direct experimental validation .",
    "the binary star observations described above are in excellent agreement with these predictions .",
    "the strehl ratios computed from the predicted companion psfs match the measured values to an accuracy of a few percent , despite a factor of two temporal variability in both the guide star and companion strehl ratios . the predicted companion psf matches observations to about 10% out to radii of 1 arcsec . while this agreement serves to validate the predictive methodology ,",
    "it must be emphasized that the adaptive optics psf depends on a large number of parameters .",
    "this three hour experiment has tested these predictions over a very modest region of the underlying parameter space .",
    "a broader application of this methodology at shorter observing wavelengths , over wider fields of view , and under diverse turbulence conditions will provide a more stringent test .",
    "in some observing conditions these predictions will almost certainly fail due to the approximations discussed in section [ theory ] . likewise , the target of this experiment was a relatively bright binary whose members are of nearly identical magnitude .",
    "additional observations will be required to understand the degree to which the photometric and astrometric precision and the contrast levels reported here are attainable in more diverse observational programs .",
    "experiments at palomar and keck observatories are currently being planned to perform this experiment on more binaries , and to employ this methodolgy on crowded field image data using both natural and laser guide star ao systems .",
    "agreement between the predicted and observed companion psf indicate a level of consistency between turbulence profile measurements from the dimm / mass equipment and the effects of anisoplanatism on the ao compensated image quality .",
    "both multiaperture scintillation spectrometry and anisoplanatism are sensitive to higher altitude turbulence , but each is sensitive to the underlying turbulence statistics in a different way .",
    "the former is sensitive to aberrations introduced by short spatial wavelengths , which give rise to scintillation .",
    "in contrast , anisoplanatism arises from aberrations at all spatial wavelengths , though the manner in which these aberrations contribute depends on the altitude of the turbulence and the spatial frequency of the aberration . in this way",
    ", these two types of measurements are sampling different spatial frequency ranges of the turbulence power spectrum . at some level",
    "the consistency of the predictions and observations serve to validate the assumption of a komolgorov turbulence spectrum .",
    "further efforts will be required to understand the level of agreement implied by these and future results .",
    "one possible approach is to perform a sensitivity analysis by generalizing equation [ covariance ] to include other classes of power spectra .",
    "an analysis of this type has been carried out by , who considered the effects of non - komolgorov power spectra on differential atmospheric tilt jitter .",
    "these results suggest several lines of longer term development that may be of direct benefit to a number of astronomical applications .",
    "the plot of strehl ratio vs. guide star offset shown in figure [ aniso_fig ] illustrates that the benefits of adaptive compensation occur over fields much larger than anticipated from the @xmath40 approximation .",
    "this suggests that adaptive optics systems with fields of view of order several arcminutes may be usefully employed for near infrared observations .",
    "one of the challenges in interpreting these data over wide fields arises from the temporal and field dependent evolution of the adaptive optics psf .",
    "the methodology described above allows a quantitative analysis of such wide field observations that can account for these effects .",
    "the photometric and astrometric results presented in section [ results ] and the dynamic range improvements implied by figure [ resid_obs_fig ] serve as illustrations of the astronomical potential of this methodology .",
    "application of this technique to the imaging and deconvolution of crowded fields and extended objects would constitute a natural progression .",
    "the approach could readily be applied to the deconvolution of both image data and spatially resolved spectra acquired with an integral field unit .",
    "lastly , agreement between predictions and observations serve as an important on - sky validation that anisoplanatism is accurately understood in the context of near infrared astronomical observations over arcminute fields of view .",
    "anisoplanatism constitutes the fundamental process underlying the use of tomography in adaptive optics .",
    "@xcite describes the application of the phase covariance in equation [ covariance ] in combining wavefront measurements from multiple guide stars to form an estimate of the wavefront in a different direction . that this same expression has been used in this research to accurately predict the anisoplanatic degradation of the near infrared adaptive optics psf over an arcminute field is a strong indication that tomographic algorithms will be successful in the same observational context .",
