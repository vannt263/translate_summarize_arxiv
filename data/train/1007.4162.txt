    "the gravitational instability ( gi ) model for giant planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is one of the two well known models for planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the model has been thought to be unable to produce solid cores observed in giant planets in the solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) until @xcite demonstrated that dust growth and sedimentation may realistically occur inside gaseous protoplanets .",
    "however , @xcite argued that giant planet embryos may become convective within the first @xmath3 years of their evolution , and that convection may inhibit grain sedimentation .",
    "@xcite have recently confirmed that convection may indeed be a serious obstacle to solid core formation inside the giant planet embryos .",
    "these authors obtained much smaller cores than the model of @xcite predicts .",
    "more recently , the gi model for giant planet formation has been criticised on the grounds that the cooling time at the inner , e.g. , @xmath4 au disc , is not short enough to permit a continuous gravitational contraction of gaseous clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whilst this criticism of @xcite ideas appears to be relevant , there are now extrasolar giant planets observed at distances out to hundreds of au from their parent star , where the core accretion model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for planet formation may not have been able to create solid cores before the gaseous disc dissipates .",
    "it seems rather likely that the gi model is needed to explain these planets .",
    "simulations of large ( e.g. , tens of au ) discs that employ realistic cooling in the optically thick regime do show formation of gaseous clumps with masses of a few to a few tens of jupiter masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which presumably cool and contract into giant planets or brown dwarfs .",
    "it is timely to reconsider the gravitational disc instability model taking into account the updated constraints on the disc fragmentation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to investigate this complicated and non - linear problem properly ,",
    "we divide presentation of our work into several papers  ( 1 , this paper ) before and ( 2 , nayakshin 2010b , to be submitted ) after the solid core formation , and ( 3 , nayakshin 2010c , submitted to mnras letters ) interplay of the processes occurring inside the embryo with external influences of the parent disc and the star .",
    "the goal of this paper ( referred in later papers as `` paper i '' ) is to study dust growth and sedimentation inside the giant embryo but excluding the solid core formation .",
    "we limit our study to isolated non - rotating giant planet embryos or first cores , the terms that we use inter - exchangeably below .",
    "while the study of such a limited problem may appear too academical , we shall use these results extensively in papers ii and iii .",
    "there is also a possibility that dust sedimentation inside first cores may also be relevant to the process of low mass star formation .",
    "therefore we hope that analytical results presented here may be useful for future researchers in more than one field .",
    "the gist of the `` new '' disc fragmentation constraints is that the giant planet embryo must start off much less dense than previously assumed .",
    "namely , @xcite assumed that the protoplanet has a mean density of order @xmath5 g @xmath6 . such high a density is needed to overcome the tidal fields from the parent star at several au distances .",
    "however , at @xmath3 au , the initial embryo density of order @xmath7 g @xmath6 is expected ( see paper ii for detail ) . optical depths of such embryos are much less than of those studied by @xcite .",
    "therefore we find that the giant planet embryo remains radiative long enough to permit dust growth and sedimentation .",
    "in fact , convection becomes important only after the solid core assembly as the energy release by the solid core rises to as much as @xmath8erg s@xmath9 ( paper ii ) .",
    "the paper is organised as following . in ",
    "[ sec : formation ] , we introduce the so - called `` first cores '' and argue that the initial state of giant planet embryos should be similar to that of the first cores . in  [ sec : int_evolution ] we study the internal evolution of _ isolated _ first cores , defining the maximum gas accretion rate onto the first core under which the core can be considered isolated .",
    "we then attempt to carry out the calculations analytically as far as we can , building a simple analytical model to follow the cooling and contraction of the first cores , and grain growth and sedimentation inside them .",
    "we also consider the influence of turbulent mixing and grain shattering via high speed collisions that may delay the onset of grain sedimentation .    in later parts of the paper ,  [ sec : num_isolated ] and  [ sec : num_results ] , we use a simple spherically symmetric radiation hydrodynamics code with a two - fluid approach to capture grain growth and dynamics to allow for a simultaneous evolution of the gas and the dust .",
    "we find higher opacity , larger metalicity and lower mass first cores to be the most promising sites of grain sedimentation .",
    "turbulent mixing mainly slows down rather than forbids grain sedimentation ; although in corners of the parameter space it may be crucially important .",
    "we conclude that whether the grains sediment inside the first core or not mainly depends on whether it contracts and hence heats to the grain vaporisation temperature faster than the grains can grow . finally , in the discussion section we overview the main results of our work , compare those to previous work , and consider implications for the field of planet formation .",
    "we argue that the planet formation community should take a detailed look at the giant instability disc model supplemented by a realistic internal evolution for the giant embryo , and also embryo dynamics in the parent disc .",
    "stars form from larger gas reservoirs due to gravitational contraction of the latter .",
    "the simplest case of a spherical , uniform , non - rotating , and initially at rest , constant density cloud is well known @xcite .",
    "the collapsing gas is initially isothermal , as cooling is very effective .",
    "however , as the innermost region of the collapsing gas fragment becomes denser , the free fall time there becomes shorter than the cooling time of the gas @xcite .",
    "the region switches from an isothermal to an adiabatic behaviour . heated up , the gas is able to stop the further collapse by thermal pressure forces .",
    "the central part of the region settles into a hydrostatic balance .",
    "this region is logically named `` the first core '' .",
    "the minimum mass of the first cores is given by the `` opacity limit '' @xcite of a few jupiter masses ( although * ? ? ?",
    "* note that the term is somewhat physically misleading ) , and the size is @xmath10 cm . the conditions in a typical _ non rotating _",
    "solar mass molecular gas cloud puts the first cores in a situation where the mass supply rate is continuous and relatively high ( @xmath2 a few @xmath11 yr@xmath9 ) . in this case new matter lands on the first core so fast that it does not have time to cool , and therefore the behaviour of the gas nearly adiabatic @xcite .",
    "they contract and heat up only due to more and more mass piling up on them from the parent gas cloud .",
    "when their mass exceeds about 50 jupiter masses , the cores reach the temperature of about @xmath12 and the gas density about @xmath13 g @xmath6 .",
    "dissociation of molecular hydrogen then ensues .",
    "this provides an additional energy sink and initiates a `` second collapse '' which finally turns the first core into a true proto - star as compact as a few solar radii .    to understand why the first cores do not collapse further until they reach a mass of about @xmath14 @xcite ,",
    "consider the virial temperature of the first core . as will be shown latter ( equation [ tvir_core ] ) , an adiabatically evolving first core has the virial temperature of about @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the mass and the radius of the first core , respectively .",
    "the core becomes hot enough for hydrogen to disassociate only when it reaches the mass of about 50 jupiter masses .",
    "consider now the properties of giant planet embryos at the moment of their formation in a protoplanetary disc . in order to fragment gravitationally ,",
    "a massive gas disc must satisfy two criteria .",
    "first of all , it must be massive / dense enough . in particular , the @xcite q - parameter must be less than unity : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gas isothermal sound speed ; @xmath20 is kepler s angular frequency ; @xmath21 is the mass of the star , assumed to be larger than that of the disc , and @xmath22 is the surface density of the disc . here",
    "@xmath23 is the disc vertically averaged density , and @xmath24 is the disc vertical scale - height . rearranging equation [ toomre ] , we see that at @xmath25 the disc mean density is equal to the tidal density of the star , @xmath26 to within a factor of order unity , where @xmath27 au .",
    "the second condition for disc fragmentation is the condition on the rate of cooling .",
    "expressed in terms of the cooling time @xmath28 , the requirement states @xcite : @xmath29 this implies that the critical radiative cooling rate per unit gram of disc material is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the specific heats ratio for gas . at the same time , the compressional heating rate for gravitational contraction is @xcite @xmath32 where we have used equation [ rhotd ] to eliminate @xmath23 .",
    "it is now clear that @xmath33 at the point of disc fragmentation .",
    "this is intuitively correct , as otherwise the disc could heat up faster than it could fragment , increasing @xmath19 and returning itself back to stability ( e.g. , @xmath34 ) .",
    "we have shown above that a fragmenting self - gravitating gas disc satisfies @xmath33 .",
    "this is also the condition that sets the `` opacity limit for fragmentation '' in star formation @xcite , which yields a minimum mass for fragmentation of a few jupiter masses .",
    "this is of course not a coincidence as in both cases gravitational collapse is stopped if the gas is unable to continue cooling rapidly enough .",
    "therefore the properties of the gaseous clumps in the disc at their inception should be similar to that of the first cores of a few jupiter masses .",
    "as with the first cores , the clumps may gain more mass from the disc .",
    "however , the giant planet embryos in the disc have to compete for gas with other embryos , as the disc is likely to fragment on many rather than one clump .",
    "collisions between clumps may unbind the clumps partially or completely .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that above the `` transition '' mass @xmath35 @xcite the planet opens up a gap in the disc due to gravitational torques between the planet and the disc , and that the gap opening curtails gas accretion onto the planet by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "giant planet embryos with mass of the order of 10 jupiter masses are in this gap - opening regime as long as @xmath36 for a solar mass star .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we study the evolution of planet embryos at a constant mass in this paper .",
    "the mass of the gaseous clump is a free parameter below .",
    "we also use the terms `` first core '' and `` giant planet embryo '' inter - exchangeably throughout .",
    "@xcite show that the structure of the first cores can be well approximated by a polytropic sphere , with the polytropic constant fixed by the gas temperature and the density @xmath37 at which the gas switches from the isothermal to the adiabatic behaviour .",
    "the typical values of these are often taken in the literature as @xmath38 k and @xmath39 g @xmath6 .",
    "however , @xmath37 does depend on the opacity of the material and the ambient gas temperature @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "following these authors , we take opacity to be dominated by dust , in the functional form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the opacity at @xmath43 k , and reasonable values of @xmath44 are thought to be between 1 and 2 . with this , the adiabatic density threshold is best described by the following @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47k .",
    "@xcite give expression for @xmath48 as a function of the central density .",
    "eliminating the density in favour of the sphere s mass and radius , we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath47 and @xmath51 . eliminating the critical density by using equation [ mi99 ] ,",
    "we get @xmath52 note that the temperature dependence in this expression is at most linear , and the opacity enters in an even weaker power . the initial size of the first core is hence varies rather little .",
    "the mean density of the first core is defined by @xmath53 and is a very strong function of the mass of the first core .",
    "the temperature of the first core is of the order of the virial temperature , which we estimate to be @xmath54 from this it follows that the sound speed in the first core is , @xmath55 , @xmath56    the column depth of the first core is @xmath57 and the optical depth of the first core is @xmath58 where @xmath59 . from this expression",
    "it is obvious that the first cores are always optically thick .",
    "the radiative luminosity of the first core is @xmath60 or numerically , @xmath61 where function @xmath62 is a cumbersome looking power - law function which does not vary much for @xmath44 between 1 and 2 , however .",
    "for example , for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , whereas for @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "nevertheless , it does become quite inconvenient to write down expressions for a general value of @xmath44 , and so we shall present the results only for either @xmath67 or @xmath68 below . for convenience of future reference , @xmath69 note",
    "that the luminosity is lower for @xmath68 than for the other case .",
    "this is due to a higher opacity of the first core , e.g. , the larger exponent in the opacity law .",
    "the binding energy of the polytropic sphere , @xmath70 allows us to calculate the cooling time of the sphere as @xmath71 for the smaller value , @xmath67 , @xmath72 whereas for @xmath68 , @xmath73    another useful time scale is the dynamical time of the core , which is of the order of the free fall time for the core : @xmath74 note that the cooling time is indeed longer than dynamical time , as should be for a hydrostatic gas configuration .",
    "having reviewed the adiabatic evolution of the first cores , we can now estimate when cooling of the cores becomes important .",
    "as the core gains ( or perhaps looses mass ) , the adiabatic temperature time derivative is @xmath75 where we used equation [ tvir_core ] . on the other hand , the temperature derivative due to radiative cooling is @xmath76 ( see also equation [ dtdt ] below ) . we define a critical `` radiative '' first core accretion or decretion rate as the one for which @xmath77 . for mass gain or loss rate below this critical rate , the radiative cooling is the dominant driver of the cloud s thermal evolution . from equation [ dtdt_radc ] and [ dtdt_ad ]",
    "we find @xmath78 @xmath79 note further that as the first cores contract , their cooling time @xmath80 increases (  [ sec : evolution ] below ) , and hence the critical radiative accretion rate actually drops with time from the value found in equation [ dmdt_crr_num ] .",
    "we can now compare the critical radiative accretion rates with the accretion rates of the first cores in the context of a solar mass gas cloud collapsing , for which the first cores accumulate mass at the rate @xmath81 yr@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these rates are higher than the critical radiative accretion rates , and therefore the first cores should indeed evolve quasi - adiabatically in these conditions .    in the opposite case , @xmath82 , the evolution of the first cores",
    "will be governed mainly by their radiative cooling .",
    "this is the case that we henceforth study in this paper .",
    "staying within the analytical approach , we calculate the cooling evolution of the first cores , assuming that they remain polytropic spheres .",
    "the solutions obtained in this way will be later compared to a numerical calculation that does not use this assumption .",
    "we obtain the solution by solving the equation @xmath83 , where the plus sign is used because we defined the binding energy to be positive . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce dimensionless temperature @xmath84 of the first core as the ratio of the current virial temperature @xmath85 to the initial virial temperature of the core at formation , as given by equation [ tvir_core ] .",
    "we also introduce a constant for a given @xmath16 , @xmath86 , which is the cooling time of the first core at formation , given by equation [ tcool ] .",
    "equation [ lrad ] shows that luminosity of the first core changes with time as @xmath87 where we used the fact that @xmath88 is a constant for a given @xmath16 .",
    "since the binding energy scales as @xmath89 at a fixed @xmath16 , the equation for the evolution of the dimensionless temperature of the first core can be written as @xmath90 which is solved as @xmath91^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\;. \\label{toft}\\ ] ] using this , we find for the cooling time evolution @xmath92 which in the limit @xmath93 shows that the cooling time is always @xmath94 times the current time . note that this implies that the first core s cooling becomes more inefficient as it contracts .",
    "the luminosity of the core evolves according to @xmath95^{\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}\\ ; , \\label{lum_of_t}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the initial luminosity of the core , given by equation [ lfc0 ] .",
    "note that equation [ lum_of_t ] is an increasing function of time , so that the first cores do become brighter as they contract , but the binding energy of the core increases with @xmath97 even faster , and this is why the cooling time is a growing function of time as well .",
    "we can now define the time scale @xmath98 defined as the time needed for the first core to heat up to the temperature @xmath99 at which grains vaporise ( see  [ sec : num_ggrowth ] ; @xmath100 , depending on the size of the grains ) .",
    "this time scale is obtained by solving @xmath101^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\ ; , \\label{tvap_in}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the initial virial temperature of the first core as given by equation [ tvir_core ] .",
    "as an example , in the limiting cases when @xmath103 , the results are : @xmath104 for @xmath63 , and @xmath105 for @xmath65 .",
    "these time scales are very long , and are strongly dependent on the mass of the first core .",
    "the term neglected in the last two equations becomes important for more massive cores that are already hot at their birth .",
    "they may reach the vaporisation temperature very quickly .",
    "figure [ fig : tvir ] shows the evolution of the virial temperature ( simply referred to as temperature of the first cores hereafter ) for several values of @xmath16 as a function of time for the two limiting opacity cases .",
    "the curves are computed using equation [ toft ] .",
    "the upper panel presents the faster contracting case @xmath67 and the lower one corresponds to @xmath68 . in the case of the lower opacity ( @xmath67 ) , the relatively massive cores , @xmath106 , contract quite rapidly during the first few thousand years . in terms of grain growth and sedimentation , these cores are not very promising , as we shall see below .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath107 for @xmath67 , and for all values of @xmath16 for @xmath68 , the cores take @xmath108 years to contract to the grain vaporisation temperature .",
    "grain growth is plausible in these cases .",
    "we also plot first core s mean densities as a function of time in figure [ fig : doft ] .",
    "as in figure [ fig : tvir ] , the curves are terminated when the core s temperature rises above @xmath109 , as then the grains would be vaporised .",
    "we see that the lower mass first cores evolve ( contract ) significantly before vaporisation of grains occur .",
    "this again hints at less massive first cores as the more promising sites of grain growth and sedimentation , as they simply stay cooler for longer .",
    "@xcite studied formation of gaseous giant planets by gravitational instability in a proto - planetary disc .",
    "he considered a gaseous clump that would eventually contract to form a proto - planet of mass @xmath110 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that if the conventional arguments for dust growth and sedimentation are specialised for the spherical geometry of the clump , then one can expect a rather rapid dust growth and sedimentation which may culminate in a formation of a heavy elements core .",
    "because of the specifics of the gravitational disc instability model for planet formation , the gas density of @xmath13 g @xmath6 was used for the gaseous clump . as shown in  [ sec:1st_analytical ] , our gaseous clumps are much less dense and are also cooler in their initial stages . nevertheless , the line of arguments of @xcite for the dust growth and sedimentation model can be simply rescaled to the problem at hand .",
    "our treatment thus follows his model .",
    "we shall first assume that turbulent motions in the first core can be neglected .",
    "this allows us to make the most optimistic estimates of grain growth and sedimentation .",
    "the importance of turbulence will be elaborated in  [ sec : turbulence ] , and further tested with numerical models in  3 .",
    "further , we note that realistically , grains of different sizes are present in the cloud at any given time , due to fragmentation of larger grains by high speed collisions .",
    "only a fraction of grains is large enough to start sedimenting down .",
    "therefore the mass fraction @xmath111 in our model should be thought to represent only those larger grains .",
    "a sizable fraction of the original grains is assumed to remain small and tightly bound to the gas .",
    "accordingly , a constant gas opacity of the form given by equation [ kappa0 ] is used despite allowing larger grains to sediment .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the grains can grow by the hit - and - stick mechanism ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "for a constant density core , the gravitational acceleration , @xmath112 , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the radial position of the grain inside the first core .    there is no pressure gradient force for the grains , but there is a gas - grain drag force if the grain velocity , @xmath115 , is different from that of gas , @xmath116 .",
    "note that @xmath115 is always subsonic with respect to the gas speed of sound , as the largest velocity that the grain can attain is the free - fall velocity which is of the same order as @xmath19 by definition .",
    "the drag force on a spherical body depends on the reynolds number , @xmath117 is the mean free path for hydrogen molecules in the gas .",
    "the latter is relatively large , e.g. , @xmath118 cm @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the dimensionless density of the first core . as we shall see below",
    ", grains will usually satisfy @xmath121 , in which case the epstein drag law applies , and one has @xcite @xmath122 here @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 g @xmath6 are the radius , the column and the mass density of the grain , respectively .    for a larger body , @xmath126 , the stokes drag law applies .",
    "the law also depends on the relative velocity @xmath127 through the reynolds number ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in the limit of the small @xmath128 , the stokes law yields @xmath129    neglecting the complicated behaviour of the drag coefficient for intermediate values of @xmath130 , we combine both regimes described by equations [ friction_epstein ] and [ friction_stoke ] into one , approximately , as @xmath131 given our simple one size dust model , a better gas drag treatment appears to be excessive , but future more detailed calculations should utilise more careful drag force treatments .",
    "the equation of motion for the grain is then @xmath132 small grains , @xmath133 , quickly reach their terminal velocity , so that @xmath134 , and the grains slip through the gas in the direction of the centre of the cloud with the sedimentation velocity @xmath135 note that this velocity is proportional to @xmath136 .",
    "for this reason , for a given radius of the grain @xmath123 , grains starting at different @xmath136 will fall to the centre at the same time .",
    "we refer to this time scale as the sedimentation or dust settling time : @xmath137 where the density of the grain @xmath138 and its size @xmath123 are in cgs units , and we assumed @xmath139 limit in the last step .    for microscopic grains , say 1 micron , the sedimentation time scale is prohibitively long .",
    "therefore grains must become larger before any sedimentation takes place .",
    "the early growth of microscopic grains is dominated by brownian motions of the smallest grains @xcite .",
    "since the sedimentation velocity is a function of the grain size @xmath123 , grains of different size move with differential speeds .",
    "hence the larger grains sweep smaller grains , leading to the growth of the grain s mass , @xmath140 , at the rate @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the mass fraction of grains , so that @xmath143 is the density of grain material .",
    "this translates into the growth rate for @xmath123 of @xmath144 one finds that this differential settling grain growth is faster than that due to brownian motion for larger grains .",
    "we now define the grain size e - folding time scale , @xmath145 , @xmath146 using @xmath147 , the grain growth time scale is defined as the time needed to increase the grain size from an initial value @xmath148 to the final size @xmath123 : @xmath149 choosing @xmath150 cm and @xmath151 cm as an example , @xmath152 . noting that @xmath153 , we see that for @xmath154 , some @xmath155 dynamical times need to pass before the grains attain a size at which they can sediment rapidly . using the relations from  [ sec:1st_analytical ]",

    "in this equation we emphasised the fact that the grain growth time estimate is obtained for @xmath158 .      comparing the grain growth time scale with the cooling times of the first cores ( equations [ tcool1 ] and [ tcool2 ] ) , and with the longer vaporisation times ( equations [ t2nd1 ] and [ t2nd2 ] ) ,",
    "one is tempted to think that grain growth is too slow to be of importance , especially for the lower opacity index , @xmath67 .",
    "however one needs to be more careful here as the first core contracts with time .",
    "therefore grain growth actually accelerates as the gas cloud cools , and especially rapidly for the case @xmath67 .",
    "using equation [ tgr ] and our model for the evolution of the first cores , we plot the time - dependent estimate for the grain growth time scale in figure [ fig : tgr ] for the same first core masses as in figures [ fig : tvir ] and [ fig : doft ] .",
    "although the lower mass cases ( upper curves in figure [ fig : tgr ] ) initially have longer grain growth time scales , they are also initially cooler and stay sufficiently cool to avoid the second collapse for longer .",
    "therefore , these cores should be promising sites of grain growth after a few hundred years , when they cross the line shown with diamonds , which is simply the current time .",

    "we use grains of the same size @xmath123 for the whole cloud , where @xmath123 is a free parameter .",
    "a more complex treatment is possible but is delayed until a future paper .",

    "we use the lagrangian radial mesh provided by the gas coordinate to follow the evolution of dust .",
    "this is natural especially for small size grains that are strongly bound to the gas , as the relative gas - grain velocity is small , and the grains essentially move with the gas .",
    "the dust is described by a density in a given radial gas shell , and is allowed to slip through gas shells ( see below ) .",
    "the grain initial density distribution follows that of gas , scaled down by the factor @xmath111 .",
    "the drag force acting on the grains / dust due to friction with the gas , @xmath251 , is given by equation [ friction2 ] .",

    "accordingly , the acceleration @xmath237 in equation [ rad_f ] is simply @xmath253 .",

    "there is a slight uncertainty in choosing the boundary conditions for grains at @xmath268 radius , that is in the very first _ gas",
    "_ mass zone .",
    "in contrast to the gaseous component , grains are not supported by pressure effects there , thus they can sediment and form a phase _ below _ even the very first mass zone of the gas .",
    "on the other hand , turbulence may suspend the grains in the fluid , curtailing the sedimentation into @xmath243 .",
    "our goal here is to be conservative in our calculations of grain sedimentation .",
    "therefore we assume that the turbulence keeps the grains suspended in the very first gas zone _ as long as _ the gas dominates the grains there by mass .",
    "accordingly , the boundary condition for grain velocity is set to @xmath269 , as for the gas , for all the numerical tests below .",
    "the simulations are stopped when the grain density in the inner zone reaches that of the gas density .",
    "one would expect that when the grain density exceeds that of the gas , the feedback that the grains impose on the turbulent motions of the gas becomes substantial , and hence the turbulent mixing support of grains should ease off .",
    "presumably a high density core composed of heavy elements is formed at this point @xcite .",
    "a special treatment for the inner boundary condition is needed when this happens .",
    "we defer a study of the core formation process until a future publication .",
    "we continue to consider only one size for the grains here , but in the interest of adding more realism to our models we allow that size to vary  grow by sticking with other grains , vaporise if gas enveloping the grain is too hot , and limit the grain growth if the differential grain velocity is too large .",
    "our grain growth model follows the analytical prescription of  [ sec : free_growth1 ] , but with the addition of brownian motions of small grains : @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the sedimentation velocity , and @xmath272 is the brownian motion velocity of the smallest grains that dominate grain relative velocities at small values of @xmath271 @xcite .",
    "the brownian motion velocity is a strong function of the smallest grains size , and we treat it as a free parameter of the model . the signs @xmath273 and @xmath274 signify grain - mass averaging of the quantities over the first core .",
    "this approach is a necessity given that the full radial and particle size distribution function treatment is beyond the scope of our initial study .",
    "grain fragmentation or cratering may result from grain collisions with inter - grain velocities exceeding a characteristic value , which depends on the size of the grains participating in the interactions @xcite .",
    "we explore these effects in a very simple fashion , introducing `` maximum velocity '' , @xmath233 , above which grain growth is significantly reduced compared with equation [ dadt2 ] . in particular , we modify the above equation to @xmath275 with this prescription , the @xmath276 as @xmath277 .",
    "finally , the grains are allowed to be vaporised if the gas temperature is large .",
    "the vaporisation rate is taken from @xcite . in practice",
    "this prescription implies vaporisation temperature between t = 1200 k and t = 1500 k , depending on grain size and relevant time scales .",
    "vaporisation is not important for any models that do not reach 1200 k.",
    "we start with the simplest , constant grain size case , setting @xmath278 cm .",
    "we neglect the turbulent grain stirring , i.e. , fixing @xmath279 .",
    "the calculation assumes the grain material density of @xmath280 g @xmath6 , initial mass fraction of @xmath281 , opacity coefficient @xmath282 , opacity power - law index @xmath65 , and the first core s mass of @xmath283 .",
    "figure [ fig : fixed_a10 ] presents several snapshots showing the evolution of the gas and the grain components .",
    "the snapshots correspond to times @xmath284 360 , 740 , 1100 and 1500 years .",
    "the first inference from the figure is that the constant density approximations for the first core itself and for the contracting grain sphere or `` cluster '' are reasonably good .",
    "the analytical estimate of the settling time for this case is @xmath285 years ( equation [ tseta ] ) .",
    "further , equation [ tself ] predicts that the grains will collect into a central sphere the mass density of which equals that of the gas at time @xmath286 years ( for @xmath281 ) . in the simulations , this occurs at time almost twice as long .",
    "this level of accuracy of the analytical estimates is nevertheless acceptable to us here .",
    "the simulations show a somewhat more complex evolution than the simple `` top hat '' profile .",
    "the upper right panel of the figure shows the radiation flux as a function of radius within the first core .",
    "note that in the last snapshot the heat flux increases significantly in the inner @xmath287 10% of the first core .",
    "this is a signature of the adiabatic contraction heating imposed by the ever increasing grain density in that region . while until this point the effects of grain sedimentation were hardly felt by the gaseous component anywhere inside the core , the `` inverse drag ''  grain drag on gas is now significant in the inner region .",
    "the gas is however stable against further collapse there as can be seen from velocity curves ( lower right panel ) : the gas and the grain phases continue to separate out , e.g. , move with different velocities .",
    "the reason for which the gas phase remains gravitationally stable is that it takes a relatively small amount of heating ( the bump in the flux curve in the upper right panel ) to set up a sufficient pressure gradient to oppose the collapse .",
    "the last snapshot of the figure corresponds to a stage between the grain - dominated one (  [ sec : grain_dominated ] ) and the `` bound grain cluster '' (  [ sec : grain_cluster ] ) . soon after the last snapshot shown in the figure the grain distribution undergoes a dynamical collapse which we shall study in a future paper .",
    "we now add turbulent mixing , still keeping the size of the grains constant at @xmath278 cm .",
    "figure [ fig : fixed_a10_alpha1m2 ] shows the density and temperature distributions for the same case computed in  [ sec : free_num ] , but for the turbulent diffusion coefficient @xmath288 .",
    "it is obvious from the snapshot sequence that the dust distribution quickly adjusts to an equilibrium shape in which the rate of gravitational settling is offset by turbulent diffusion .",
    "the contraction of the density distribution between the last two snapshots is entirely due to the contraction of the gas distribution , which occurs on the radiative cooling time scale of about @xmath289 years .",
    "note that no dense grain cluster forms in this case no matter how long we were to follow the calculation .",
    "after the first core has contracted enough to reach @xmath290 k , it would undergo the well known second collapse @xcite .",
    "apparently , the effects of grain sedimentation for these particular parameters are completely negligible .      figure [ fig : fixed_a10_alpha1m3 ] shows a calculation identical to that presented in  [ sec : fixed_a_strong_turb ] and in figure [ fig : fixed_a10_alpha1m2 ] , but now for a weaker turbulent mixing , with @xmath291 . once again an equilibrium is quickly set up , but a much more concentrated one .",
    "it is interesting to note that this equilibrium implies a strong metalicity gradient within the gas cloud , with the most metal rich gas being in the central regions .",
    "our final experiment with fixed size grains is to repeat the calculation of  [ sec : fixed_a_mid_turb ] but with a larger size of grains , @xmath292 cm .",
    "figure [ fig : fixed_a30_alpha1m3 ] demonstrates a very rapid sedimentation of grains in this case , with gravitational collapse of the `` grain cluster '' (  [ sec : grain_cluster ] ) occurring by about 500 years .",
    "as expected , larger grains are affected significantly less by the turbulent mixing .",
    "the rapid grain sedimentation in this calculation yields a mean grain sedimentation velocity of about @xmath293 m s@xmath9 in this model .",
    "such a rapid sedimentation would undoubtedly lead to shattering of some of the grains , so that this calculation is somewhat unrealistic , but it goes to show that if grains can grow to decimetre sizes , then they can probably overcome the effects of turbulent mixing",
    ".        we shall now explore our `` full '' model that includes the grain growth prescriptions (  [ sec : num_ggrowth ] ) .",
    "selected runs that we performed and discuss below are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "some of the parameters of the models have very little bearing on the results , except near the boundaries separating qualitatively different regimes .",
    "these parameters are not listed in the table . in particular , the results are insensitive to the initial size of the grain , @xmath148 , and the brownian motion velocity , @xmath294 , as long as the latter is large enough ( most of the runs were performed with @xmath295 cm s@xmath9 ) .",
    "this is because , starting from @xmath296m - size grains , one finds that grains quickly reach sizes of hundreds of @xmath296 m anyway ( see also more detailed calculations , showing a similar initial rapid grain growth , by * ? ? ?",
    "thus @xmath148 is set to @xmath297 m for most tests below .",
    "given the large differences in the cooling times (  [ sec:1st_analytical ] ) , the form of the opacity law predictably turns out to be quite important .",
    "the names for the runs performed with the power - law index @xmath67 starts with a letter `` s '' for `` small opacity '' , whereas names for @xmath68 runs start with `` l '' for `` large opacity '' .",

    "@xmath298 is also varied in some models .",
    "the last three columns in table [ table1 ] list several output quantities of the simulations .",
    "@xmath299 , @xmath300 and @xmath301 are the time at which the self - gravitating phase of the grain sphere evolution is reached ( if ever ) , and the central temperature and the density of gas , respectively , at that time .",
    "grains were vaporised before they could make a massive self - gravitating sphere in the centre in the runs in table 1 for which no values of these three parameters are given .",
    "we first discuss runs l1 , l2 and l3 , the three models that are identical to each other except for the value of the turbulent mixing coefficient , which was set to @xmath302 and @xmath303 , respectively .",
    "there is very little difference in the evolution of the models .",
    "this may appear surprising given the all - important role the turbulence played in the simulations with the fixed grain size .",
    "the `` paradox '' is resolved by realising that the runs always start with the turbulence - dominated regime ( small grains ) and end up in the negligible turbulence one ( large grains ) , and only the time and the boundary between these two vary in l1-l3 .",

    "the curves are terminated at the point when the central radial bin is dominated by the grains .",
    "initially the curves in the figure are nearly identical to each other .",
    "this can be understood by realising that at a small @xmath123 , sedimentation speeds are low , so that turbulent mixing easily balances sedimentation",
    ". a quasi - steady state results in which grain sedimentation is neutralised by turbulent mixing .",
    "figure [ fig : a_vs_t ] shows that grain growth is slightly faster for higher levels of turbulence .",
    "we explain it by the fact that the grain distribution is slightly more extended in this case , hence the sedimentation velocity , proportional to @xmath136 ( see equation [ vsed ] ) , is larger , allowing the grains to sweep up smaller ones at a faster rate and hence grow faster .",
    "the process of grain growth accelerates with time . at early times",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath304 , thus @xmath305 ( see equation [ dadt2 ] ) . at later times , grains become over - abundant in the inner regions , i.e. , @xmath306 there .",
    "this speeds up the rate at which the larger grains can sweep up the smaller grains even further .",
    "this non - linear stage of grain growth is naturally reached faster by the lower turbulence models .",
    "a corollary of this is that the higher turbulence runs reach the grain self - gravitating phase with higher temperature and density .",
    "nevertheless , it is notable how qualitatively similar the three simulations actually are .",
    "one difference is the time when the central region becomes grain - dominated .",
    "it is @xmath307 , 8.4 and 11 thousand years for @xmath308 and @xmath303 , respectively .",
    "the later the grain - dominated phase reached , the hotter is the central region of the first core , and the denser it is ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the main conclusion we can draw from these experiments is that the turbulent diffusion is only likely to delay rather than stop grain sedimentation _ if _ grain growth can proceed via the hit - and - stick process faster than the gas heats up to vaporise the grains .      to explore sensitivity of our grain growth model to grain fragmentation due to high speed collisions",
    ", we ran several models where the maximum velocity parameter @xmath233 was reduced from the nominal value of @xmath309 m s@xmath9 to 1 m s@xmath9 ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",

    "qualitatively the two runs are similar , but the grain - dominated cluster phase is reached at time almost twice as long in l2a than in l2 .",
    "this is caused by the subdued grain growth rate in the run l2a compared with l2 .",

    "this occurs when the first cores become too hot , so that grains vaporise .",
    "we find this behaviour if ( a ) the cores are too hot ( too massive ) to begin with ; ( b ) the opacity is low so that the cores cool very quickly ( thus leading to hotter internal temperatures ) ; ( c ) the grain content of the core is low , yielding too long grain growth times .",

    "both conditions ( b ) and ( c ) are the case for this particular run .",
    "the grains manage to reach the size of about 1 cm before they are vaporised .",
    "the central gas temperature is almost @xmath313 k at that time .",
    "grain vaporisation actually starts earlier , at @xmath314 k or so , but does not immediately prevail over the process of grain growth .",
    "the other two runs shown in figure [ fig : no_sed ] have much more massive cores , @xmath315 ( s7 in table 1 ; dotted red curve ) and @xmath316 ( s6 ; dashed blue ) .",

    "the cores cool quickly nevertheless as the opacity power law index @xmath67 , hence the short cooling times ( equation [ tcool1 ] ) .",
    "the most massive first core considered here ( blue curve ) is almost too hot to allow grain growth to begin with ( case `` a '' above ) .",
    "as the cooling time is short , the core undergoes a quick and nearly dynamical evolution in the beginning , driving hydrodynamical oscillations that allow some early grain growth .",
    "however the latter is quickly turned into grain evaporation as the core settles into its cooling evolution .      amongst the parameters of the simulations that we varied",

    "a higher grain content obviously favors grain growth .",
    "for example , the runs l4 and l5 are identical except for the grain mass fraction , @xmath281 and @xmath319 , respectively . not surprisingly , the grain - dominated phase is reached far faster in l5 than in l2 .",

    "in this paper we explored the possibility that grains may sediment inside isolated or slowly accreting first cores , which are the gaseous condensations with mass between about 5 and 50 jupiter masses .",
    "while many parameters ( such as the turbulent viscosity parameter ) determine the end result , the main requirement for sedimentation to take place is a rapid enough grain growth .",
    "based on numerical experiments , sedimentation occurs as long as grains can grow to a few cm to a few tens of cm before vaporisation temperature of @xmath320 k is reached .",
    "this is expressed mathematically as @xmath321 where @xmath322 is the grain growth time scale ( equation [ tgr_exact ] ) , and @xmath98 is the vaporisation time of the grains ( equation [ tvap_in ] ) .",
    "turbulent mixing and grain shattering by collisions may slow down grain growth compared with the analytical model ( in which case @xmath322 must be obtained numerically ) .    while the outcome depends on several parameters  mass of the first core , @xmath16 , ambient gas temperature , @xmath40 , opacity law in the first core , the initial grain mass fraction , @xmath111 , turbulent mixing , etc .",

    "in particular , we shall fix @xmath281 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 m s@xmath9 , and @xmath38 k.    with these parameters fixed , we can ask the following question : at a given opacity coefficient @xmath298 , what is the range of the first core masses that could support the dust sedimentation ?",
    "figure [ fig : mcloud_max ] answers this question for the two opacity power - law indexes that we studied here , @xmath67 ( black dotted curve ) and @xmath68 ( red dashed one ) .",
    "the lower ( solid ) line gives the minimum mass of the first core which we obtained by requiring that the mean first core density ( equation [ rho_mean ] ) is at least equal that at which the collapsing gas switches to the adiabatic behaviour ( equation [ mi99 ] ) .",
    "this curve is independent of @xmath44 for @xmath325 .",
    "the curves dividing the parameter space are obtained by solving the equation [ time_cond ] with our analytical model for grain growth and the first core contraction .",
    "the asterisks are the maximum first core mass for which grain sedimentation occurs found numerically for the @xmath68 case .",
    "they are encouragingly close to the analytical curve . the fact that they are slightly below",
    "is probably explained by the extra delay in the grain growth that the turbulent mixing and the maximum velocity @xmath326 impose in numerical simulations compared with the analytical models that do not account for these processes .",
    "this limited survey of parameter space demonstrates that there range in @xmath16 in which grain sedimentation is possible is about a factor of 10 wide for @xmath68 , and shifts to higher masses for higher opacities .",
    "this is to be expected , as higher opacity implies longer cooling times .",
    "the @xmath67 case ( black dotted line ) shows a narrower window of opportunity for dust sedimentation , which is again a cooling effect .",
    "as these cores cool quicker , there is less time for dust growth .",
    "our analytical model and numerical simulations confirm the suggestion made by @xcite that grains can grow and sediment inside giant embryo , although started from a much less dense initial configuration .",
    "while a fuller comparison is to be made in paper ii where we continue the calculations to the point of the solid core formation , we can already see that this lower density and temperature initial configuration is key to address the criticism levelled on the @xcite model by @xcite , later confirmed by @xcite .",
    "these authors found that their giant planet models were convective , and that convective grain mixing has significantly slowed down the core growth .",
    "since the initial column depth of the embryos is much lower in our models , the radiative cooling remains strongly dominant over convective cooling for @xmath327 years , the time it takes ( see figure 2 ) for the embryos to contract to densities and temperatures considered by the authors mentioned above .",
    "these findings echo the results by @xcite who studied early contraction of a 1 jupiter mass gas cloud and concluded that the planet remained radiative during the first @xmath328 years . while his model does not include dust sedimentation , it accounts for h@xmath329 molecules dissasociation , hydrogen ionisation , and much more ( that we do not include here ) .",
    "his calculations also used similarly cool initial conditions ( @xmath330 k was the initial temperature of his model planet ) .",
    "therefore it appears that most of the differences between us and @xcite can be traced to the significantly different initial conditions . in terms of applications to planet formation field , the differences in our results and that of @xcite are striking .",
    "these authors found that a 5 jupiter mass embryo can not yield any dust sedimentation as it is too hot to begin with , e.g. , the initial temperature above the grain vaporisation temperature . in contrast , we find that a 5 jupiter mass embryo provides an excellent environment for dust growth : the gas temperature is initially less than 100 k and stays below 1400 k for as long as @xmath289 to more than @xmath331 years , depending on the opacity ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) .    in paper ii we do find that convection becomes very important in the inner region of the embryo _ once a massive solid core forms",
    "_ , as this releases a significant amount of heat .",
    "it is also interesting to note that while our initial condition is significantly different , the inferred grain growth and sedimentation time scales are from @xmath332 to @xmath289 years , in a broad agreement with the estimate by @xcite .    on the other hand , in a qualitative agreement with @xcite , the conditions for dust growth found to deteriorate with an increasing mass of the gas clumps .",
    "depending on opacity , grains can not sediment for giant embryo masses higher than @xmath333 to a few tens jupiter masses .",
    "our calculations here and in paper ii lend support to the ideas presented by @xcite , except that grain sedimentation process must start earlier in the life of the protoplanet , while it can still be considered the first core .",
    "lower initial temperatures and rather long cooling times of the giant embryo in the latter stage are key for a successful grain sedimentation outcome .",
    "@xcite argued that giant embryos may yield not only giant planets but also giant icy planets with cores if the metal poor envelopes of the embryos are removed .",
    "irradiation by a nearby star was suggested to accomplish this .",
    "while this is certainly possible , it may be not very probable as ob stars are rare .",
    "the present paper is the base for paper iii , where we argue that giant embryos may migrate inward due to the gravitational torques from the disc .",
    "estimates show that embryos may migrate to the distance of several au to the parent star in several @xmath334 years , typically .",
    "as cooling of embryos slows down as they age , the embryos must be eventually disrupted by the tidal forces or by the heating due to irradiation from the parent star .",
    "this opens up an exciting possibility that _ all _ planets may be formed by such a modified version of gravitational instability model .",
    "in this paper we considered the grain growth and sedimentation process inside the giant planet embryos , which we argued must be nearly identical in properties to the first cores .",
    "these are the first gaseous hydrostatic condensations from which stars may form .",
    "we found that grains can indeed grow and sediment to the centre of the gas cloud provided that the gas remains cool enough ( temperature below @xmath335 k ) for the time it takes the grains to reach a few cm size .",
    "the efficiency of the dust sedimentation process and the final mass of the solid core are strong functions of opacity and other parameters of the problem .",
    "we suggested that astrophysical applications of these results may be in the field of planet formation , where giant planet embryos may serve as birth places for all types of planets if these embryos migrate inward and get tidally or irradiatively disrupted in the inner few au from the parent star .",
