    "a large part of the motivation for the study of @xmath1 stems from the result of brock @xcite which asserts that @xmath2 is quasi - isometric to @xmath3 , the teichmller space of @xmath0 equipped with the weil - petersson metric . as such , @xmath2 ( or any of its relatives also discussed in this article ) is a combinatorial model for teichmller space .    by results of wolpert @xcite and chu @xcite ,",
    "the space @xmath3 is not complete .",
    "masur @xcite proved that its completion @xmath4 is homeomorphic to the _ augmented teichmller space _ of @xmath0 , obtained from @xmath3 by extending fenchel - nielsen coordinates to admit zero lengths .",

    "the pants graph admits an analogous stratification , where the stratum @xmath9 corresponding to the multicurve @xmath7 is the subgraph of @xmath1 spanned by those pants decompositions that contain @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , brock s quasi - isometry between @xmath1 and @xmath3 may be chosen so that the image of @xmath9 is contained in @xmath8 .    in light of this discussion , it is natural to study which strata of @xmath1 are convex .",
    "this problem was addressed in @xcite , where certain families of strata in @xmath1 were proven to be totally geodesic ; moreover , it is conjectured that this is the case for all strata of @xmath1 , see conjecture 5 of @xcite . as was observed by lecuire ,",
    "the validity of this conjecture is equivalent to the existence of only finitely many geodesics between any pair of vertices of @xmath1 ; we will give a proof of the equivalence of these two problems in the appendix .",
    "the main purpose of this note is to study the extrinsic geometry of strata in certain graphs of pants decompositions closely related to @xmath1 , namely the _ diagonal pants graph _ @xmath10 and the _ cubical pants graph_. concisely , @xmath10 ( resp .",

    "note that brock s result @xcite implies that both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are quasi - isometric to @xmath3 , since they are quasi - isometric to @xmath1 .",
    "these graphs have recently arisen in the study of metric properties of moduli spaces ; indeed , rafi - tao @xcite use @xmath10 to estimate the teichmller diameter of the thick part of moduli space , while @xmath11 has been used by cavendish - parlier to give bounds on the weil - petersson diameter of moduli space .",

    "our first result is :    [ thm : punctures ] let @xmath0 be a sphere with punctures and @xmath6 a multicurve .",
    "then @xmath15 is convex in @xmath10 .",
    "we remark that , in general , strata of @xmath10 are not totally geodesic ; see remark [ rmk : outside3 ] below .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : punctures ] will follow directly from properties of the _ forgetful maps _ between graphs of pants decompositions .",
    "in fact , the same techniques will allow us to prove the following more general result :    let @xmath17 be an essential subsurface of a surface @xmath0 such that @xmath17 has the same genus as @xmath0 .",

    "[ main2 ]    next , we will use an enhanced version of the techniques in @xcite to show an analog of theorem [ thm : punctures ] for general surfaces , provided the multicurve @xmath7 has _ deficiency _ 1 ; that is , it has one curve less than a pants decomposition .",

    "convex copies of @xmath25 were exhibited in @xmath1 , and it is unknown whether higher rank convex flats appear . the corresponding question for the diagonal pants graph is whether there exist convex copies of @xmath21 with a modified metric which takes into account the edges added to obtain @xmath10 ; we will denote this metric space @xmath26 . using theorems [ thm : punctures ] and [ main2 ]",
    ", we will obtain a complete answer to this question , namely :    [ cor : punctures ] there exists an isometric embedding @xmath27 if and only if @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "our second application concerns the _ finite geodesicity _ of different graphs of pants decompositions . combining theorem [ thm : punctures ] with the main results of @xcite",
    ", we will obtain the following :    let @xmath0 be the six - times punctured sphere , and let @xmath29 be two vertices of @xmath1 .",

    "[ geodesics ]    the analogue of corollary [ geodesics ] for @xmath10 is not true .",
    "indeed , we will observe that if @xmath0 is a sphere with at least six punctures , one can find pairs of vertices of @xmath10 such that there are infinitely many geodesics in @xmath10 between them .",
