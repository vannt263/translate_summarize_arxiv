    "gravitational collapse has been exhaustively studied in the last thirty years . basically , the complexity of the field equations is responsible for the lack of exact solutions which could provide us with some insight to understand the collapse phenomena . for this reason ,",
    "one of the most studied simplified models is that of a massless scalar field coupled to gravity in a spherically symmetric context .    in several papers @xcite ,",
    "christodoulou studied in detail the solutions of the spherically symmetric einstein - scalar field equations from an analytical point of view . on the other hand ,",
    "an intriguing result came from a numerical study .",
    "more precisely , choptuik @xcite exhibited the occurrence of critical phenomena in the formation of black holes by numerically integrating the corresponding set of partial differential equations for several initial - space - distributions of the scalar field , parameterized say by @xmath0 .",
    "he showed that there is a generally critical value , @xmath1 , that separates solutions containing black holes from those which do not , and that the mass of the black hole formed near this critical point satisfies a power law @xmath2 , where @xmath3 seems to be a universal exponent .",
    "remarkably , the same kind of critical behavior was found for the collapse of gravitational waves in axisymmetric spacetimes@xcite , and all this may be seen as an indication that the observed critical phenomena are independent of the collapsing matter as well as of the symmetries considered .    currently , it is a fascinating task to look for analytical solutions that exhibit exactly the above - mentioned critical behavior .",
    "husain et al@xcite obtained a result where there is , for some cases , formation of an apparent horizon , but the black hole mass evaluated on it grows without bound .",
    "the same situation was found by roberts@xcite ( self - similar case ) , and in some other models related to the self - similar one @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze both the solution of the field equations in the case treated by roberts and the collapse phenomena for conformally coupled massless scalar fields .    besides several attractive features of models with conformally coupled fields@xcite , choptuik states that these models have a critical behavior such as that described above depends weakly on the coupling constant @xmath4 of the @xmath5 term .",
    "the conformal case is characterized by @xmath6 . ] , and our aim is to study these phenomena , but from an analytical point of view .",
    "our analysis is based on the technique of generation of solutions for conformally coupled scalar fields , starting from those associated to the ordinary scalar fields , first developed by bekenstein@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 1 we present the basic equations for the einstein - scalar field system and the general solution for the case of a simplified spherically symmetric background .",
    "it is shown that among two possible solutions , that leading to the scalar field collapse is the same as the one already found by roberts .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the mapping of roberts solution into a solution for the self - similar collapse of a conformally coupled scalar field , followed by an analysis of the critical phenomena related to the formation of black holes .",
    "finally , the conclusions contain a brief discussion about this work and some of its possible extensions .",
    "let us consider the line element for spherically symmetric spacetimes written as :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are null coordinates .",
    "the field equations in which the ordinary massless scalar field is taken as the source of curvature are    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the scalar field .",
    "the einstein - scalar field equations are :    @xmath12    we shall restrict our study to the case in which @xmath13 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that a general solution for eq.([r1 ] ) can be written as :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are arbitrary functions .",
    "now , it is possible to explicitly determine @xmath15 and @xmath16 by building an equation involving only @xmath17 from ( [ fi1],[fi2],[fi3 ] ) ,    @xmath18    introducing ( [ h1 ] ) into ( [ r2 ] ) and expanding @xmath15 and @xmath16 in power series .",
    "we find , by induction , that the latter equation restricts the form of @xmath19 and @xmath20 to second order polynomials ,    @xmath21    where the @xmath22 and @xmath23 coefficients must satisfy : @xmath24    the relation above without loss of generality .",
    "] has two different solutions for @xmath25 .",
    "the first one is given by    @xmath26    in which case we are assuming @xmath27 . note that , although ( [ sol1 ] ) apparently leads to four independent constants , @xmath28 , since @xmath27 it is always possible to remove the linear ( in @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and independent terms of ( [ h1],[g12 ] ) by introducing @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with suitable constant values for @xmath31 and @xmath32 . after making that shift ,",
    "we arrive at a solution for @xmath33 with only two independent constants , which coincides with the one already found by roberts@xcite ( self - similar case ) .",
    "another solution to ( [ sol0 ] ) is given by :    @xmath34    that is ,    @xmath35    and there are only three independent constants : @xmath36 , it is not possible to recover roberts solution by a constant shift on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 variables of ( [ g12],[h1 ] ) . ] .",
    "this solution has a killing vector @xmath37 besides those associated to the spherical symmetry . in turn",
    ", this killing vector can be timelike or spacelike , depending on the sign of @xmath38 , leading to a static or time - dependent ( cosmological model ) solution that can not describe the scalar field collapse .",
    "let us now solve the field equations ( [ fi1],[fi2],[fi3 ] ) for the scalar field @xmath11 . taking ( [ fi1 ] ) , for instance ,",
    "along with the solution found for @xmath39 in which @xmath27 , we arrive at :    @xmath40    for the case in which @xmath41 , we have :    @xmath42    the first case has already been analyzed@xcite in order to reproduce analytically the critical behavior obtained by choptuik@xcite . by adjusting a characteristic parameter of the solution ,",
    "say @xmath43@xcite ( @xmath38 in our notation ) , three classes are obtained : subcritical ( @xmath44 ) , where the scalar field collapses and disperses , leaving behind a flat spacetime ; critical ( @xmath45 ) , where the final result is an asymptotically flat spacetime with a null singularity ; and supercritical ( @xmath46 ) , corresponding to the formation of black holes . among these classes ,",
    "the last is the most interesting , despite the undesirable fact that the mass of the black hole grows without bound as @xmath47 .",
    "in this section , we apply the technique of generating solutions for conformally coupled scalar fields first developed by bekenstein@xcite , departing from roberts solution .",
    "the actions for a massless conformally coupled scalar field @xmath48 and for the ordinary one , @xmath11 , are given respectively by    @xmath49    @xmath50    where @xmath6 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the metric tensors associated to ordinary and conformally coupled scalar fields , respectively .",
    "these actions are connected by the conformal transformation :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath6 , and the relation between @xmath48 and @xmath11 is given by :    @xmath55    as we can see from the above , in this manner we generate two distinct types of conformally coupled scalar field solutions .",
    "henceforth , we will denote the solutions for the first case type @xmath56 and type @xmath57 for the second . before going on with the determination and analysis of the conformal solutions ,",
    "it is useful to define the mass function @xmath58 as :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 denotes the radius of the two - sphere . from the equation above , we can write a relation between the mass function @xmath61 associated to the conformally coupled scalar field solutions and the corresponding one associated to the ordinary scalar field , @xmath62 . after direct calculation",
    ", the following expression arises :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 and @xmath39 is the radius of the two - sphere given by the ordinary scalar field solution .",
    "now , applying the transformations ( [ tr1],[tr2 ] ) to roberts solution , the metric tensor components and the conformally coupled scalar field appear , respectively , as :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is given by :    @xmath68    the solution above is self - similar since it brings about a homothetic killing vector    @xmath69    from these expressions and ( [ mass ] ) , the mass function is determined directly after some calculation as :    @xmath70\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    type @xmath56 solutions are the ones with the upper sign in the above expressions , whereas the lower sign case stands for what we have called type @xmath57 solutions .",
    "we now choose @xmath71 , without loss of generality , in order to restrict ourselves only to the collapse case , and analyze the following cases : ( a ) @xmath72 , ( b ) @xmath73 and ( c ) @xmath74 .    for type",
    "@xmath56 solutions , the area of the two - sphere , @xmath75 , vanishes in the same regions in which @xmath76 does , since the conformal factor @xmath77 is always different from zero .",
    "the invariants @xmath78 and @xmath79 diverge in these regions , indicating the existence of singularities . due to the fact that an everywhere conformal transformation does not alter the spacetime structure ,",
    "these solutions exhibit the same phases as roberts solution .    concerning the apparent horizon dynamics ,",
    "we start from the definition of the locus of such structures :    @xmath80    two relations are obtained : @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in neither case",
    "is it possible to express @xmath83 as an explicit function of @xmath9 .",
    "a numerical plot is thus necessary , indicating that the relevant expression is @xmath82 , given by :    @xmath84    for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , there is no apparent horizon . only for @xmath74",
    "is the apparent horizon present ( see fig .",
    "it is also possible to show that @xmath85 , whereas for roberts solution @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the only modification is the slope of the curve .",
    "the mass function evaluated on the apparent horizon , i.e. the mass of the black hole , is :    @xmath87    where @xmath88 .",
    "again , the mass of the black hole grows without bound for @xmath89 . whether or not we consider the self - similar collapse for @xmath90 , as done in @xcite",
    ", the important thing is to exhibit the power law of @xmath91 for near - critical evolution ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we obtain :    @xmath92    the exponent differs from @xmath93 , claimed by choptuik and others to be universal .",
    "in fact , we could argue that the value of the coupling constant @xmath4 is responsible for this difference .",
    "however , as pointed out in the numerical work , the exponent depends only weakly on @xmath4 .",
    "thus , as in the ordinary scalar field collapse ( the exponent is 0.5 ) , the origin of this difference is unclear within our model .",
    "contrary to the previous case , type @xmath57 solutions exhibit distinct spacetime structure .",
    "the singular regions , in general characterized by @xmath94 , are described by @xmath95 , or by @xmath96 , i.e. , the conformal factor vanishes . in this way , an additional singular region given by @xmath97",
    "is present .",
    "such a region separates two different spacetimes , which we denote by @xmath98 and @xmath99 , that are characterized by @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "another new feature is that the region @xmath102 is singular ( @xmath103 as well as @xmath104 diverge on @xmath102 ) , even though @xmath105 is finite in it .",
    "such a region can be interpreted as a cosmological null singularity at the null infinity past , where the scalar field diverges .",
    "the structure of the spacetime @xmath98 depends on @xmath38 , as we can see from fig .",
    "the spacetime @xmath99 is not altered by changing the parameter @xmath38 , and , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , this spacetime is limited by three singular regions.as before , the dynamics of the apparent horizon is described by @xmath106 , or :    @xmath107    for @xmath98 , we find the same behavior as in the type @xmath56 solution ( or roberts solution ) : there is an apparent horizon , and consequently black hole formation , only for @xmath74 .",
    "the mass of the formed black hole tends to infinity as @xmath47 , and for near - critical behavior the power law displays the same value as before , i.e. @xmath108 . the structure of @xmath99 is not altered by changing the parameter @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "3 ) ; therefore , there is no critical behavior related to the black hole formation , and the timelike singularity is surrounded by an apparent horizon .",
    "the evolution of the mass of the  black hole \" , @xmath91 , is distinct from the previous case : in the very beginning ( @xmath109 ) , @xmath91 is infinity ; then , it diminishes gradually to become equal to zero at @xmath97 .",
    "we have analyzed , for the first time , self - similar collapse of conformally coupled scalar fields .",
    "the main motivation was to reproduce analytically the critical behavior discovered numerically by choptuik .",
    "for this task , we have used the technique which permits the generation of solutions for conformally coupled scalar fields departing from those for ordinary scalar fields .",
    "thus , from roberts solution ( self - similar ) , we obtained two types of solutions which we denoted type @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "type @xmath56 solutions have no new qualitative features if compared with roberts solution .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 plays the central role : the value @xmath73 separates the solutions which do not form black holes ( @xmath72 ) from those that do ( @xmath74 )",
    ". however , as a characteristic of the continuous self - similar regime , the mass of the black hole tends to infinity for @xmath47 . despite this undesirable and unphysical behavior ( asymptotically",
    "all spacetime becomes trapped ) , we found a power law for the mass of the black hole for near critical evolution .",
    "the exponent is @xmath108 .",
    "this value is not close to @xmath93 , obtained in the numerical work , and it is not clear we can expect such a strong influence of the coupling parameter @xmath6 on the exponent . according to choptuik , the exponent depends only weakly on @xmath4 .",
    "it would be interesting to check this conjecture in the more general case of a non - minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "type @xmath57 solutions , on the other hand , reveal some new characteristics . due to an additional singular region described by @xmath97 , two distinct spacetimes have to be taken into account .",
    "we called them @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and they are characterized by @xmath101 and @xmath100 , respectively ( see figs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) .",
    "the critical behavior was found to take place only for solutions @xmath98 , and the exponent for the power law associated with @xmath91 is the same as that for type @xmath56 solutions . as a final remark ,",
    "the dynamics of type @xmath99 solutions is independent of @xmath38 : the spacetime is limited by three singular regions ( fig .",
    "( 3 ) ) , and an apparent horizon encloses the timelike singularity .",
    "thus , this situation is not relevant with respect to the critical behavior in the gravitational collapse .",
