    "relations between various algebras / groups as well as their subalgebras / subgroups played an important role in the lie algebras / groups theory and its representation theory development .",
    "one of these relations is the well known inn - wigner contraction @xcite that was , besides its mathematical merits , an important tool in numerous physical applications .",
    "there is a variety of inn - wigner lie algebra contraction applications arising in various parts of theoretical physics .",
    "just to mention a few ranging from contractions from the poincar algebra to the galilean one , and from the heisenberg algebras to the abelian ones of the same dimensions ( a symmetry background of a transition processes from relativistic and quantum mechanics to classical mechanics ) to those of contractions in the kaluza - klein gauge theories framework , say from ( anti-)desitter to the poincar algebra , and various cases involving the virasoro and kac - moody algebras .",
    "for instance , our recent study of the affine gauge gravity theory in @xmath7 @xcite is heavily related to the @xmath8 algebra contraction w.r.t .",
    "its @xmath9 subalgebra , and the representations of the relevant algebras . in physical terms , the meaning of the inn - wigner contraction is to relate , for instance , strong to weak coupling regimes of the corresponding theories , or geometrically curved to  less curved and/or flat spaces .",
    "it is not so well known that there is an inverse to the inn - wigner contraction called the gell - mann formula @xcite .",
    "this formula is a simple prescription designed to determine a deformation of a lie algebra that is `` inverse''to the inn - wigner contraction .",
    "this formula relates elements of the starting algebra to the corresponding ones of the contracted algebra .",
    "moreover , by its construction it relates also the representations of these two algebras . since , by a rule , various properties of the contracted algebra are much easier to explore ( e.g. construction of representations @xcite , decompositions of a direct product of representations @xcite , etc . ) , this formula found its place , as a useful and simple tool , even in some textbooks and in the mathematical encyclopedia @xcite .    to emphasize its meaning ,",
    "this formula is also referred to as the `` decontraction '' formula .",
    "this formula was introduced by dothan and neeman ( while working at caltech on noncompact algebras and their representations ) @xcite and advocated by hermann who learned from gell - mann about this formula , named it after gell - mann , and made important contributions to the formula himself .    in the general case the gell - mann formula construction goes as follows",
    ": let @xmath10 be a symmetric lie algebra @xmath11 with a subalgebra @xmath12 such that : m , t , m . [ starting_algebra ]",
    "further , let @xmath13 be its inn - wigner contraction algebra w.r.t its subalgebra @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath14 , where = \\{0}. the gell - mann formula states that the elements @xmath15 can be in certain cases expressed in terms of the contracted algebra elements @xmath16 and @xmath17 by the following rather simple expression : t = i [ c_2(m ) , u ] + u. [ gm_general ] here , @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the second order casimir operators of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 algebras respectively , while @xmath20 is a normalization constant and @xmath21 is an arbitrary parameter . for a mathematically strict definition , cf .",

    "the main drawback of the gell - mann formula is its limited validity .",
    "there is a number of references dealing with the question when this formula is applicable @xcite .",
    "the formula is best studied in the case of ( pseudo ) orthogonal algebras @xmath22 contracted w.r.t .",
    "their @xmath23 and/or @xmath24 subalgebras , i.e. in the corresponding group cases : @xmath25 and/or @xmath26 , where , loosely speaking , the gell - mann formula works very well @xcite",
    ". moreover , the case of ( pseudo ) orthogonal algebras is the only one where this formula is valid for ( almost ) all representations @xcite .",
    "recently , we studied the @xmath0 cases where the gel - mann formula does not hold as a general operator expression and its validity depends heavily on the @xmath0 algebra representation space . an exhaustive list of the cases for which the gell - mann formula for @xmath0 algebras hold is obtained @xcite .",
    "there were some attempts to generalize the gell - mann formula for the `` decontracted''algebra operators of the complex simple lie algebras @xmath27 with respect to decomposition @xmath28 @xcite , that resulted in a form of relatively complicated polynomial expressions .    in this work we consider gell - mann s formula in the @xmath0 algebra cases , where the contraction is performed w.r.t .",
    "their maximal compact @xmath2 subalgebras .",
    "the gell - mann formula in these cases is especially valuable as a tool in the problem of finding all unitary irreducible representations of the @xmath0 algebras in the basis of the @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 groups generated by their @xmath2 subalgebras .",
    "finding representations in the basis of the maximal compact subgroup @xmath3 of the @xmath29 group , is mathematically superior , and it suites well various physical applications in particular in nuclear physics , gravity , physics of p - branes @xcite etc .",
    "as an example consider a gauge theory based on the affine spacetime symmetry @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "the gauge covariant derivative , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , as acting on an affine matter field @xmath35 , is given by , @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the @xmath0 connections , and @xmath38 enumerate the matter field components .",
    "the matter ",
    "gravity vertices require the knowledge of the @xmath0 operators matrix elements @xmath39 in the hilbert space of the matter field components @xmath40 .",
    "in particular , for a generic spinorial @xmath41 matter field , en explicit form of the matrix elements of the @xmath0 generators for infinite - dimensional representation corresponding to the @xmath42 field is required .    moreover , this framework opens up a possibility of finding , in a rather straightforward manner , all matrix elements of noncompact @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath41 generators for all finite and infinite dimensional representations . unfortunately , as stated above , the original gell - mann formula is of limited validity , and it can be applied in the classes of multiplicity free representations only .",
    "recently we have demonstrated , by an explicit construction , that the gell - mann formula has a generalization that is valid for all irreducible representations of the @xmath0 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 algebras @xcite .",
    "these formulas , though comparatively simpler than the ones resulting from some other attempts to generalize the gell - mann formula , are still rather cumbersome taking a few rows . in this paper",
    "we present a generalization of the gell - mann formula that is almost as compact and simple as the original formula , which is valid for _ all representations of the @xmath0 algebras for all @xmath45 values_.    in our previous study of the gell - mann formula and its generalization for the @xmath0 , @xmath46 algebras @xcite , we first extracted the generalized formula from the previously known generic expressions in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 cases which enabled us to obtain finally the generalized formula for the @xmath8 algebra . a crucial ingredient in generalization of the gell - mann formula for the @xmath0 algebras is a role of the `` left - rotation '' action of the @xmath4 subgroup of the corresponding @xmath41 group , which manages the non trivial multiplicity of the maximal compact @xmath2 subalgebra representations for a generic @xmath0 representation . in this work",
    "we show , by making use of the cartesian basis , how to obtain the explicit form of the generalized gell - mann formula for an arbitrary @xmath0 algebra with a left - rotations included properly and demonstrate the closure of the @xmath0 algebra commutation relations .",
    "moreover , we showed how to rewrite the expression of the generalized formula in a suitable basis ( e.g. the gelfand - tsetlin basis ) allowing us to directly write down matrix expressions of the @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath1 , generators for an arbitrary irreducible representation in the basis of the @xmath4 group .",
    "note that due to mutual relations between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 algebras , one can convey the gell - mann formula results obtained for the @xmath0 algebras to the corresponding ones of the @xmath1 algebras .",
    "though , there are some subtleties in that process that are considered below .",
    "as already stated , the gell - mann formula , except in the cases of ( pseudo ) orthogonal algebras , is not generally valid by itself , and its validity depends on the representations of the algebra as well",
    ". therefore , in the case of the @xmath29 groups , i.e.  their @xmath0 algebras , one faces , in addition to the pure algebraic features , the matters that are relevant to the group / algebra representations theory as well : notably ( i ) the group topology properties , and ( ii ) the non trivial multiplicity of the @xmath29 , and @xmath0 representations in the @xmath3 , and @xmath2 basis , respectively .",
    "both features are rather subtle for @xmath49 .",
    "note that , in the case of the @xmath0 algebras , due to a fact that the generalization of the gell - mann formula depends on the algebra irreducible representation features , the construction itself deviates from the standard lie algebra deformation approach .",
    "the @xmath29 group can be decomposed , as any semisimple lie group , into the product of its maximal compact subgroup @xmath50 , an abelian group @xmath51 and a nilpotent group @xmath52 .",
    "it is well known that only @xmath53 is not guaranteed to be simply - connected .",
    "there exists a universal covering group @xmath54 of @xmath55 , and thus also a universal covering of @xmath56 : @xmath57 . for @xmath49",
    ", @xmath29 has double covering , defined by @xmath58 the double - covering of the @xmath3 subgroup .",

    "can embed @xmath41 into a group of finite complex matrices that contain @xmath4 as a subgroup . a scan of the cartan classical algebras points to the @xmath61 groups as a natural candidate for the @xmath29 groups covering .",

    ", one finds that the orthogonal subgroup of the @xmath65 and @xmath66 groups is @xmath67 and not @xmath68 . for a detailed account of the @xmath69 case cf",
    "thus , we conclude that there are no covering groups of the @xmath29 , @xmath49 groups defined in finite - dimensional spaces .",
    "an explicit construction of all @xmath70 irreducible representations , unitary and nonunitary multiplicity - free spinorial @xcite , and unitary non - multiplicity - free @xcite , shows that they are infinite - dimensional .",
    "the universal ( double ) covering groups , @xmath41 , @xmath49 of the @xmath29 , @xmath49 group are groups of infinite complex matrices .",
    "all their spinorial representations are infinite dimensional . in the reduction of this",
    "representations w.r.t .",
    "@xmath4 subgroups , one finds @xmath4 representations of unbounded spin values .",
    "the @xmath71 groups are compact , with a simply connected group manifold , thus being its own universal coverings .",
    "the @xmath3 subgroups are embedded into the @xmath71 groups as @xmath45-dimensional matrices , and this embedding does not allow nontrivial ( double ) covering of @xmath3 within @xmath71 . as a consequence , in the reduction of the @xmath71 unitary irreducible representations one finds the tensorial @xmath3 representations only .",
    "an inspection of the unitary irreducible representations of the @xmath41 , @xmath43 groups @xcite shows that they have , as a rule , a nontrivial multiplicity of the @xmath4 , @xmath72 subgroup representations .",
    "it is well known , already from the case of the @xmath73 representations in the @xmath74 subgroup basis , that the additional labels required to describe this nontrivial multiplicity can not be solely related to the group generators themselves .",
    "an elegant solution , that provides the required additional labels , is to work in the group manifold of the @xmath3 maximal compact subgroup , and to consider an action of the group both to the right and to the left . in this way one obtains , besides the maximal compact subgroup labels , an additional set of labels to describe the @xmath3 subgroup multiplicity .",
    "the @xmath0 algebra operators , i.e.  the @xmath29 , @xmath41 group generators , can be split into two subsets : @xmath76 , @xmath77 operators of the maximal compact subalgebra @xmath2 ( corresponding to the antisymmetric real @xmath78 matrices , @xmath79 ) , and the , so called , sheer operators @xmath80 , @xmath77 ( corresponding to the symmetric traceless real @xmath78 matrices , @xmath81 ) . the @xmath0 commutation relations , in this basis , read : & = & i(_acm_bd + _ adm_cb - _ bcm_ad - _ bdm_ca ) , [ mmcommutator1 ] + [ m_ab , t_cd ] & = & i(_act_bd + _ adt_cb - _ bct_ad - _ bdt_ca ) , [ mtcommutator ] + [ t_ab , t_cd ] & = & i(_acm_db + _ adm_cb + _ bcm_da + _ bdm_ca ) . [ ttcommutator ] the @xmath1 algebra operators can be split likewise w.r.t .",

    "the @xmath82 and @xmath80 operators are mutually related by @xmath82 = i @xmath80 , and the @xmath84 $ ] differs from ( [ ttcommutator ] ) by having an overall plus sign on the right - hand side .",
    "the inn - wigner contraction of @xmath75 with respect to its maximal compact subalgebra @xmath2 is given by the limiting procedure : u_ab _ 0 ( t_ab ) , [ limit ] which leads to the following commutation relations : & = & i(_acm_bd + _ adm_cb - _ bcm_ad - _ bdm_ca ) + [ m_ab , u_cd ] & = & i(_acu_bd + _ adu_cb - _ bcu_ad - _ bdu_ca ) [ mucommutator ] + [ u_ab , u_cd ] & = & 0 .",
    "therefore , the inn - wigner contraction of @xmath75 gives a semidirect sum @xmath85 algebra , where @xmath86 is an abelian subalgebra ( ideal ) of `` translations '' in @xmath87 dimensions .",
    "the gell - mann formula , a prescription to provide an `` inverse''to the inn - wigner contraction , ( [ limit ] ) , in this case reads : t^_ab = [ c_2(so(n ) ) , u_ab ] + u_ab , [ gell - mann_original]where @xmath88 denotes the second order casimir operator of the @xmath2 subalgebra , @xmath89 , while @xmath21 is an arbitrary ( complex ) parameter and @xmath20 is a ( real ) normalization constant that depends on @xmath45 .",
    "this expression can also be written in an equivalent form : t^_ab = - _ c u_c\\{am_b}c +  u_ab , [ gell - mann_original_v2]where @xmath90 differs from @xmath21 accordingly , and @xmath91 denotes symmetrization of the enclosed indices .    in order to make use of the gell - mann formula to obtain the @xmath0 representations , the first necessary step is to determine representation matrix elements of the contracted algebra operators .",
    "the corresponding contracted group is a semidirect product of @xmath3 and an abelian group , and it is well known that the usual group induction method provides the complete set of all inequivalent irreducible representations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will not pursue the induction approach here .",
    "instead , we will rather proceed to work in the representation space of square integrable functions @xmath92 over the @xmath4 group ( in accord with the @xmath29 topological properties ) , with the standard invariant haar measure . as for our final goal , this approach ensures certain advantages : ( i ) the generalized gell - mann formula is expressed in terms of tensor operators w.r.t .",
    "the maximal compact subgroup basis ( instead w.r.t . the eigenvector basis of the abelian subgroup ) , ( ii ) this representation space allows for all inequivalent irreducible representations of the contracted group ( some of the irreducible representations are multiply contained , i.e. each such representation appears as many times as is the dimension of the corresponding little group representation and all of them , irrespectively of the corresponding stabilizer , can be treated in an unified manner ) , and ( iii ) this space is rich enough to contain all representatives from equivalence classes of the @xmath41 group , i.e.  @xmath0 algebra representations @xcite .",
    "the last feature provides the necessary requirement of a framework needed for generalization of the gell - mann formula , i.e. a unique framework providing for all @xmath0 ( unitary ) irreducible representations .    the generators of the contracted group are generically represented in this space as follows . the @xmath2",
    "subalgebra operators act , in a standard way , via the group action to the right : @xmath93 the abelian operators @xmath94 act multiplicatively as wigner s @xmath95-functions ( the appropriate representation @xmath3 group matrix elements as functions of the group parameters ) : u_ab |u| d^_v ( ab)(g^-1 ) , [ uisd]@xmath96 being a constant norm , @xmath97 being an @xmath3 element , and in order to simplify notation we denote by @xmath98 ( in a parallel to the young tableaux ) the symmetric second rank tensor representation of @xmath3 .",

    "taking an inverse of @xmath27 in ( [ uisd ] ) ensures the correct transformation properties .",
    "the form of the representation of the abelian operators merely reflects the fact that they transform as symmetric second rank tensor w.r.t @xmath2 ( [ mucommutator ] ) and that they mutually commute .    a natural discrete orthonormal basis in the @xmath4 representation space is given by properly normalized functions of the @xmath4 representation matrix elements : & & \\{|    l@l \\{j } & + \\{k } & \\{m }    >",

    "all representations meaning : finite , infinite , tensorial and spinorial .",
    "a distinct feature of our generalized gell - mann formula approach is that the generalized expression goes beyond the standard notion of deformation of the contracted algebra , as it depends on additional operators , @xmath118 , not belonging , however directly related , to the contracted algebra .",
