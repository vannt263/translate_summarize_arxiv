    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath4 , ( muon @xmath0 ) has been measured very precisely  @xcite .",

    "they are light enough to be produced at the lhc experiments .",
    "recently , lhc phenomenology of the superparticles that are relevant for the muon @xmath0 has been studied in ref .",
    "it has been shown that they can be discovered in the near future in most of the parameter regions , especially in regions where the susy contributions to the muon @xmath0 are dominated by chargino  sneutrino diagrams . however , the searches rely on the assumption that the wino is light .",
    "this assumption is not necessary to explain the muon @xmath0 discrepancy , when the susy contribution is mainly from bino  smuon diagrams .",

    ", we study searches for the models in which only the bino and the left- and right - handed smuons are light , while the other superparticles including the wino are decoupled from the lhc sensitivity .",

    "if the left - right mixing were allowed to be arbitrarily large , the superparticles could be extremely heavy while keeping the contribution to the muon @xmath0 , thereby escaping any collider searches .",
    "however , too large left - right mixing spoils stability of the electroweak vacuum . hence , the superparticle masses are bounded from above .",
    "we will show that , when staus and smuons have comparable masses to each others , upper bounds on the slepton masses are within the reach of lhc / ilc .",
    "if the staus are much heavier than smuons , the mass bounds are relaxed , while lepton flavor violations ( lfv ) and cp violations ( cpv ) generically become too large .",
    "therefore , we will show that almost all the parameter regions can be tested in future complementarily by lhc / ilc and lfv / cpv , if the muon @xmath0 anomaly is solved by the bino and the left- and right - handed smuons .",
