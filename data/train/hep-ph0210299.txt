    "in this paper we improve and extend the `` technicolor straw man model '' ( tcsm )  @xcite of collider signatures for dynamical electroweak and flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "the tcsm is a simple phenomenology of the lowest  lying vector and pseudoscalar technihadrons expected in technicolor theories which have both a walking gauge coupling @xmath11 and topcolor interactions to generate the large mass of the top quark .",
    "the main improvements arise in the color @xmath12 singlet sector of the model . the treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite assumed fermion ",
    "antifermion annihilations to technihadrons occurred at subprocess cm energy @xmath13 .",
    "this is is appropriate in a hadron collider where the parton @xmath14 sweeps over the narrow tcsm resonances and is , therefore , strongly dominated by the poles . in this paper",
    "we modify the production amplitudes to make them accurate for @xmath14 below the resonances as well .",
    "these modifications involve adding the continuum amplitudes including , where appropriate , the three  point anomaly amplitudes for production of an electroweak gauge boson and a technipion  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly appropriate for technihadron searches at @xmath3 colliders such as lep  @xcite ( and the proposed linear collider if its early stage has @xmath15 ) .",
    "our extension of the tcsm includes several low  lying color  non - singlet , isosinglet states  four vector @xmath5 s , the massive topcolor gauge boson , @xmath4 , and a neutral pseudoscalar @xmath16 . these particles are most readily produced and detected in hadron colliders  the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc)because of their relatively large coupling to gluons .",
    "we have incorporated the improved and extended production processes in the event generator pythia  @xcite to allow detailed investigation by collider experiments .",
    "the modern description of technicolor  @xcite requires a walking technicolor gauge coupling  @xcite to evade unwanted flavor - changing neutral currents and the assistance of topcolor interactions that are strong near 1  tev  @xcite to provide a large top quark mass .",
    "both these elaborations on the basic technicolor / extended technicolor ( tc / etc ) proposal require a large number @xmath17 of technifermion doublets .",
    "many technifermions are needed to make the beta function of walking technicolor small .",
    "many also seem required in topcolor - assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) to generate the hard masses of quarks and leptons , to induce the correct mixing between heavy and light quarks , and to break topcolor symmetry down to ordinary color ( via technifermion condensation ) .",
    "a large number of technidoublets implies a small technipion decay constant @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "this , in turn , implies a technicolor scale @xmath20 and masses of a few hundred gev for the lowest  lying technihadrons ( @xmath10 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "the signatures of this low  scale technicolor have been sought in run  i of the tevatron collider  @xcite . in the past two years",
    ", several lep experiments have published limits on color  singlet technihadrons  @xcite which in some cases exceed those set at fermilab .",
    "run  ii will significantly extend the reach of run  i in color  singlet and octet sectors .",
    "if these low  scale technihadrons exist , they certainly will be seen in lhc experiments  @xcite .",
    "the tcsm provides a simple framework for these searches .",
    "first , and probably most important , we assume that the lowest - lying bound states of the lightest technifermions can be considered _ in isolation_. the lightest technifermions are expected to be an isodoublet of color singlets , @xmath21 .",
    "color triplets , discussed below , will be heavier because of @xmath12 contributions to their hard ( chiral symmetry breaking ) masses .",
    "we assume that all technifermions transform under technicolor @xmath22 as fundamentals .",
    "the electric charges of @xmath23 are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the color  singlet bound states we consider are vector and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the vectors include a spin - one isotriplet @xmath26 and an isosinglet @xmath2 . in topcolor - assisted technicolor ,",
    "there is no need to invoke large isospin - violating extended technicolor interactions to explain the top - bottom splitting .",
    "thus , techni - isospin can be a good approximate symmetry , so that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are nearly degenerate .",
    "their mixing will be described in the neutral  sector propagator matrix , @xmath27 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gzprop ] ) below .",
    "the new , improved formulas for the decays and production of these technivector mesons will be presented in sections  2 and  3 .",
    "the lightest pseudoscalar @xmath23 bound states , color  singlet technipions , also comprise an isotriplet @xmath28 and an isosinglet @xmath29 .",
    "however , these are not mass eigenstates .",
    "our second important assumption for the tcsm is that the isovectors are simple _ two - state mixtures _ of the longitudinal weak bosons @xmath30 , @xmath31the true goldstone bosons of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking in the limit that the @xmath32 couplings @xmath33 vanish  and mass - eigenstate pseudo - goldstone technipions @xmath34 : [ eq : pistates ] _",
    "we assume that @xmath35 gauge interactions dominate the binding of all technifermions into technihadrons",
    ". then the decay constants of color  singlet and nonsinglet @xmath10 are approximately equal , @xmath36 , and the mixing angle is given by [ eq : sinchi ] f_t",
    "/ f_1/ 1 .    similarly , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is another mixing angle and the ellipsis refer to other technipions needed to eliminate the two - technigluon anomaly from the @xmath29 chiral current .",
    "it is unclear whether , like @xmath1 and @xmath2 , these neutral technipions will be degenerate as we have previously proposed  @xcite . on one hand",
    ", they both contain the lightest @xmath39 as constituents . on the other , because of the anomaly cancellation , @xmath40 must contain other heavier technifermions such as the color triplets we discuss below .",
    "if @xmath41 and @xmath40 are nearly degenerate and if their widths are roughly equal , there may be appreciable @xmath41@xmath40 mixing and , then , the lightest neutral technipions will be ideally - mixed @xmath42 and @xmath43 bound states .",
    "searches for these technipions ought to consider both possibilities : they are nearly degenerate or not at all .",
    "color  singlet technipion decays are mediated by etc and ( in the case of @xmath40 ) @xmath12 interactions . in the tcsm",
    "they are taken to be  @xcite : [ eq : tpiwidths ] ( f f ) & = & 1 n_f p_f c^2_1f ( m_f + m_f)^2 +   + ( gg ) & = & 1 _ c^2 c^2_1 g ^2 m_^3 .",
    "like elementary higgs bosons , technipions are _ expected _ to couple to fermion mass .",
    "thus , @xmath44 is an etc - model dependent factor of order one _ except _ that tc2 suggests @xmath45 so that there is not a strong preference for technipions to decay to ( or from ) top quarks .",
    "the number of colors of fermion  @xmath46 is @xmath47 .",
    "the fermion momentum is @xmath48 .",
    "the qcd coupling @xmath49 is evaluated at @xmath50 ; and @xmath51 is a clebsch of order one .",
    "the default values of these and other parameters are tabulated at the end of this paper . for @xmath52 ,",
    "these technipions are expected to decay as follows : @xmath53 or @xmath54 or even @xmath55 ; @xmath56 and , perhaps @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the breaking of topcolor to ordinary color is most economically achieved by color  triplet technifermions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath12nonsinglet technihadrons to exist .",
    "the lightest of these may have masses not very much larger than their color  singlet counterparts .",
    "production and detection of color  nonsinglet @xmath1 and @xmath10 have been studied before , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite . in these studies",
    "it was assumed that there exists one doublet of color  triplet technifermions , one or more doublets of color  singlets , and their associated technihadrons . in the likely case that techni ",
    "isospin is a good symmetry , the most accessible states would then be an isosinglet @xmath5 , produced as an @xmath61channel resonance in @xmath6 and @xmath7 collisions , and the technipions ( as well as dijets ) into which @xmath5 may decay . with the advent of tc2 , this simple model became obsolete .    in tc2 models ,",
    "the existence of a large @xmath62 ( but not @xmath63 ) condensate and mass is due to @xmath64 gauge interactions which are strong near 1  tev  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 interaction is @xmath66@xmath67 symmetric while @xmath68 couplings are @xmath66@xmath67 asymmetric .",
    "this makes these forces supercritical for the top quark , but subcritical for bottom .",
    "there are weaker @xmath69 gauge interactions in which light quarks ( and leptons ) may or may not participate .",
    "the two @xmath70 s must be broken to weak hypercharge @xmath71 at an energy somewhat higher than 1  tev by electroweak ",
    "singlet condensates  @xcite .",
    "this breaking results in a heavy color  singlet @xmath72 boson whose physics we do not consider in this paper ( see , however , refs .",
    "the two @xmath73 s are broken to their diagonal @xmath12 subgroup .",
    "when this happens , a degenerate octet of `` colorons '' , @xmath4 , mediate the broken topcolor @xmath73 interactions .",
    "there are two variants of tc2 : the `` standard '' version  @xcite , in which only the third generation quarks are @xmath65 triplets , and the `` flavor  universal '' version  @xcite in which all quarks are @xmath65 triplets .",
    "we consider both in this paper .    in either version of tc2 , the @xmath73 s",
    "are economically broken to @xmath12 subgroup by using technicolor and @xmath68 interactions , both strong near 1  tev .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume the existence of two electroweak doublets of technifermions , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which transform respectively as @xmath76 and @xmath77 under the two color groups and technicolor . the desired pattern of symmetry breaking occurs if @xmath22 and @xmath68 interactions work together to induce electroweak and @xmath78 noninvariant condensates ( which , of course , preserve @xmath12 and @xmath79 ) [ eq : tconds ] u_il u_jr = -w^u_ij _ t , d_il d_jr = -w^d_ij _ t , ( i , j = 1,2 ) . here",

    "then , unitarity implies [ eq : unitarity ] & & w^u , d_11 + w^u , d_22 = 0 , + & & w^u , d_12 = ( w^u , d_21)^ * = e^i_u , d , where @xmath85 are phases to be chosen .",
    "this minimal tc2 scenario leads to a rich spectrum of color  nonsinglet states readily accessible in hadron collisions .",
    "we concentrate on the lowest  lying isosinglet color octets .",
    "in addition to the colorons , @xmath4 , these include four @xmath5 formed from @xmath86 , and a technipion @xmath16 .",
    "these states are constructed in section  4 . in section  5",
    "we discuss the decay rates of @xmath5 and @xmath4 under the simplifying assumption that @xmath87 . as in the color ",
    "singlet tcsm , this is likely because the large coupling of walking technicolor significantly enhances the etc contribution to @xmath88  @xcite . in the extreme walking @xmath11 limit , @xmath89 . in section  6",
    "we present the dijet production cross sections , using the fully mixed propagator of gluons , colorons and the four @xmath5 .",
    "these cross sections are now encoded in the pythia event generator  @xcite .",
    "simulated signals ( at the parton level ) appropriate to run  i of the tevatron collider are presented in section  7 , with special attention to the effects on the @xmath90 invariant mass distribution .",
    "two comments are in order before moving on .",
    "first , it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath91@xmath92 mixing constrains @xmath93@xmath94 in standard , but not flavor  universal , tc2 ( also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here , @xmath95 is the @xmath65@xmath96 mixing angle defined in section  4 below .",
    "this constraint relies on the form of quark mass and mixing matrices expected in etc / tc2 .",
    "we view as independent and complementary the limit on @xmath97 that may be derived from collider jet data .",
    "second , bertram and simmons have used d  jet data from run  i to place the limit @xmath98 in flavor ",
    "universal tc2  @xcite .",
    "their analysis did not include the potential complicating effects of @xmath5 and their interference with @xmath4 .",
    "our tcsm analysis closes this loophole .",
    "we find limits on the coloron mass as high or higher than theirs .",
    "in the limit that the electroweak couplings @xmath99 , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decay as [ eq : vt_decays ] & & _ t _ t = ^2 ( ) + 2(w_l ) + ^2 ( w_l w_l ) ; +   + & & _ t _ t _ t = ^3 ( ) + . the @xmath1 decay amplitude is [ eq : rhopipi ] ( ( q ) _",
