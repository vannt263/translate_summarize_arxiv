    "in this paper we consider dynamic equations for the gravitational field which are obtained at the generalization of the relativity theory on the case of the most general space - time geometry .",
    "the general relativity supposes , that the riemannian geometry is the most general space - time geometry .",
    "this supposition is based on our insufficient knowledge of a geometry , when one supposes that any geometry is axiomatizable .",
    "it means , that any geometry is constructed as a logical construction . in reality there",
    "exist nonaxiomatizable space - time geometries @xcite , which are constructed by means of the deformation principle @xcite as a deformation of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "this geometry is described completely by the world function @xcite and only by the world function .",
    "such a geometry is called a physical geometry , because physicists need such a geometry , which is a science on location of geometrical objects and on their shape , ( but not as a logical construction ) .",
    "physicists use a geometry as a tool for investigation of the space - time properties .",
    "physicists are indifferent to the question , whether or not a geometry is a logical construction",
    ".    physical geometry may be continuous , or discrete .",
    "it may be even granular , i.e. partly continuous and partly discrete .",
    "the physical geometry is described by the same manner in all cases .",
    "properties of the physical geometry are determined only by properties of the world function ( but not by properties of the point set , where the geometry is given ) . as a result",
    "the physical geometry may be formulated in the coordinateless form ( only in terms of the world function ) . a good illustration of this fact is the following example .",
    "let the proper euclidean geometry be given in the cartesian coordinates @xmath0 on the square @xmath1 \\times \\left [ 0,1\\right ] $ ] .",
    "it means , that the world function is given on this square .",
    "let us map the square @xmath1 \\times \\left [ 0,1\\right ] $ ] onto the one - dimensional segment @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "let the mapping @xmath2 be one - to - one .",
    "it is possible only , if the mapping is discontinuous at any point .",
    "for instance , the mapping can be realized as follows .",
    "let coordinates @xmath3 @xmath4 , @xmath5 be presented in the form of decimal fractions@xmath6where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are decimal ciphers . the formulas ( [ c1.0 ] ) realizes one - to - one mapping @xmath9 .",
    "now the world function @xmath10 is given on one - dimensional segment @xmath1 $ ] .@xmath11nevertheless , considering the world function on the one - dimensional segment @xmath1 $ ] , one can reconstruct the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "in particular , one can determine , that the geometry on the segment @xmath1 $ ] is the two - dimensional euclidean geometry ( in the sense , that the maximal number of linear independent vectors is equal two ) , although the geometry is given on one - dimensional segment .    for construction of a physical geometry",
    "it is sufficient to give a world function for any pair of points of the point set , where the geometry is given .",
    "one does not need to prove numerous theorems and to test a compatibility of geometric axioms .",
    "the world function @xmath12 is a function of two points@xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a distance between the two points .",
    "the number of possible world functions is much more , than the number of infinitesimal intervals @xmath16 , which are functions of only one point . in particular",
    ", there is only one isotropic uniform geometry ( the geometry of minkowski ) in the set of riemannian geometries .",
    "it is described by the world function @xmath17 . in the set of physical geometries",
    "any geometry is isotropic and uniform , if it is described by the world function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an arbitrary function , having the property @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the world function of the geometry of minkowski .    in particular , the space - time geometry , described by the world function@xmath22is uniform and isotropic .",
    "here @xmath23 is the quantum constant , @xmath24 is the speed of the light and @xmath25 is some universal constant . besides , this geometry is nonaxiomatizable and discrete . in this space - time geometry",
    "any motion of a free pointlike particles is multivariant ( stochastic )",
    ". statistical description of this stochastic motion is equivalent to the quantum description in terms of the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "this circumstance admits one to obtain a statistical foundation of quantum mechanics and to interpret quantum effects as geometrical effects .",
    "it admits one to exclude the quantum principles from the set of prime physical principles and to reduce the number of physical essences , what is important for fundamental physical theories .    by definition",
    "the special relativity is a consideration of physical phenomena in the flat uniform isotropic space - time . in the set of riemannian geometries",
    "there is only one such a geometry .",
    "it is the space - time geometry of minkowski .",
    "description of physical phenomena in the geometry ( [ c1.1 ] ) should be qualified as an extended special relativity , because the space - time geometry ( [ c1.1 ] ) is isotropic and uniform , but it is non - riemannian",
    ".    statistical foundation of quantum theory shows also , that the real space - time geometry may be non - riemannian , and one can not restrict oneself , considering only the riemannian space - time geometries .",
    "generalization of the general relativity on the case of physical space - time geometry appears to be possible only at taking into account two essential clauses :    1 .",
    "consideration of physical geometries .",
    "use of adequate relativistic concepts , and , in particular , a use of the relativistic concept of the events nearness .",
    "the reasons of violation of the first condition are investigated in r2010 .    in the beginning of the twentieth century the theoretical physics developed on the way of geometrization . the special relativity and the general relativity were only stages of this geometrization .",
    "but the physics geometrization appeared to be restricted by our poor knowledge of geometry , when one knew only axiomatizable geometries .",
    "one was not able to work with discrete geometries and geometries with restricted divisibility .",
    "quantum effects might be explained easily by multivariance of the space - time geometry .",
    "however , the property of multivariance was not known in the beginning of the twentieth century , and scientists were forced to introduce new ( quantum ) principles of dynamics . as a result the quantum paradigm of the microcosm physics development appeared . the quantum paradigm dominated during the whole twentieth century .",
    "the quantum paradigm contains more essences , than it is necessary .    in the end of the twentieth century ,",
    "when our knowledge of geometry became more complete , we may return to the program of further geometrization of physics .",
    "the geometrical paradigm appeared to be possible , when , using classical dynamic principles , quantum effects are freely explained by the properties of the space - time geometry .",
    "the geometrical paradigm is more attractive , because it uses less essences , than the quantum paradigm does . to replace the quantum paradigm by the geometrical one ,",
    "it is necessary to generalize the special relativity and the general relativity on the case of an arbitrary physical geometry of space - time .",
    "the physical geometry is a geometry , which is described completely by the world function , ( world function is a half of the squared distance ) .",
    "practically , the physical geometry is a metric geometry , which is liberated from all constraints on metric except the constraint , that the world function ( or metric ) is equal to zero for two coinciding points .",
    "the physical geometry is a very simple construction @xcite . for constructing the physical geometry one does not need to formulate axioms and to prove numerous theorems .",
    "it is sufficient to know the proper euclidean geometry , which is used as a standard physical geometry .",
    "all definitions of the proper euclidean geometry @xmath26 may be formulated in terms of the euclidean world function @xmath27 . replacing the euclidean world function @xmath27 in all definitions of the euclidean geometry by other world function @xmath10 , one obtains all definitions of the physical geometry @xmath28 , described by the world function @xmath10 .    besides , the physical geometry is a monistic conception , which is described by the only fundamental quantity @xmath10 .",
    "all other geometrical quantities and concepts are expressed via fundamental quantity automatically .",
    "this circumstance admits one to modify a physical geometry easily , because all other geometric quantities concepts are modified automatically at modification of the fundamental quantity @xmath10 . @xcite .",
    "program of physics geometrization admits one to construct a monistic conception of physics with the fundamental quantity @xmath10 .",
    "the set of all riemannian geometries is only a small part of the set of all physical geometries .",
    "a generalization of the relativity theory on the case of arbitrary physical geometry admits one to obtain such results , which can not be obtained in the framework of the riemannian geometry .",
    "the generalization of the special relativity ( motion of particle in the given space - time geometry ) on the case of arbitrary physical space - time geometry has been made already @xcite .",
    "a generalization of description of the matter influence on the arbitrary space - time geometry met some problems .",
    "these problems are connected with the fact , that in the relativity theory some basic concepts are taken from the nonrelativistic physics .",
    "concepts of nonrelativistic physics are inadequate for consecutive geometric description of the relativity theory and for generalization of this description on the case of a more general space - time geometry .",
    "practically all physical phenomena on the earth are nonrelativistic . at first",
    ", we study nonrelativistic physics with its nonrelativistic concepts .",
    "relativistic effects appeared as corrections to nonrelativistic physics . in the beginning of the twentieth century",
    "the relativistic physics was presented in terms of slightly corrected nonrelativistic concepts .",
    "for instance , the relativity principle has been presented as invariance of the dynamic equations with respect to lorentz transformation and as existence of the supreme speed of the interaction propagation .",
    "such a formulation is useful for pedagogical goals , when one needs to transit from concepts of nonrelativistic physics to relativistic ones .",
    "however , such a formulation is not effective , when one tries to develop the relativistic physics . in this case",
    "one should use concepts , which are adequate for relativistic physics .",
    "in particular , the relativity principle is formulated in adequate concepts as follows .",
    "the relativistic physics is a physics in the pseudo - euclidean space - time geometry of index 1 ( geometry of minkowski or that of kaluza - klein ) .",
    "all other details of description are corollaries of properties of the space - time geometry . for instance ,",
    "properties , concerning the role of the light speed , are pure geometrical properties of the space - time .",
    "unfortunately , the formulation of the relativity theory in adequate ( geometrical ) terms is used rare .",
    "the main difference of space - time geometry in a relativistic theory from that in the non - relativistic ( newtonian ) physics is as follows .",
    "relativistical event space ( space - time ) geometry is described by one invariant ( space - time interval ) , whereas in the newtonian physics the event space is described by two invariants ( spatial distance and temporal interval ) . sometimes one does not mention this difference in textbooks .",
    "instead one speaks on difference in transformation laws . in reality , the difference in the number of invariants is a fundamental property , whereas the difference of the transformation laws is a very special property , because it is essential only for flat space - time geometry .",
    "besides , the transformational properties are used only at description at some coordinate system",
    ". they are useless at the coordinateless description .",
    "this difference of formulations is not essential , when the theory is used for calculation of concrete physical effects .",
    "however , this difference becomes essential , if one tries to obtain a generalization of the relativity theory on the case of the arbitrary space - time geometry .",
    "for instance , the concept of a pointlike particle as a point in the configuration space is a nonrelativistic concept .",
    "it needs concepts of velocity and acceleration of this particle .",
    "these concepts are secondary concepts , which can be introduced only after introduction of the linear vector space and , in particular of a coordinate system .",
    "these concepts are inadequate in the case of a discrete space - time geometry . as a result the concept of velocity and that of acceleration can not be used in an extension of the relativity theory to the case of arbitrary space - time geometry , which may be discrete .    in the general relativity all interactions ( electromagnetic and gravitational ) are supposed to be short - range interactions .",
    "concept of short - range interaction is based on the nonrelativistic concept of the events nearness .",
    "the events are considered as points in the event space ( space - time ) .",
    "two events are considered to be near , if they happen in the same place at the same time moment .",
    "this definition of nearness of events is nonrelativistic , because this definition refers to a spatial distance and to a temporal interval at once .",
    "a consistent relativistic concept of nearness is to contain a reference to only quantity : space - time interval , ( or world function ) .",
    "for instance , if a supernew star flashed very far , and an observer on the earth observed this flash , the event of flash and the event of this flash observation on the earth are near ( close ) events.0flash1    according to common viewpoint the statement on nearness of the two events ( flash and observation of this flash ) seems to be rather strange and unexpected .",
    "however , from consistent relativistic viewpoint the two events are near , because space - time interval between them is equal to zero .",
    "the problem of relativistic concept of nearness is discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is known as the principle of fokker @xcite , which is interpreted as a conception of the action at a distance ( but not as a relativistic concept of nearness ) .",
    "the action at a distance is treated as a direct influence of one object onto another one without intermediate agent circulatory between them .",
    "let us consider the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "let @xmath15 be the euclidean distance between the points @xmath29 and @xmath14 .",
    "the set @xmath30 of points @xmath29 , defined by the relation@xmath31is called @xmath32-vicinity of the point @xmath33 .",
    "if the parameter @xmath32 is small , the points @xmath29 and @xmath33 are near  @xmath34 . if @xmath35 , @xmath32-vicinity @xmath30 degenerates into one point @xmath36 .",
    "it is easy to see , that , if @xmath37 , then @xmath38 .",
    "the relation of nearness in the proper euclidean geometry has the property of transitivity : if @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it follows from the triangle axiom,@xmath43which is valid for the proper euclidean geometry . if @xmath32 @xmath44 , then @xmath45 @xmath44 also .",
    "it means that , if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then @xmath37 .",
    "the property of transitivity seems to be a natural property of the relation of nearness .",
    "however , the transitivity property of the nearness relation does not take place in the space - time geometry , for instance , in the geometry of minkowski . in this case",
    "the @xmath32-vicinity @xmath30 of the point @xmath33 is defined by the relation @xmath48here @xmath49 is the world function of the space - time of minkowski@xmath50@xmath3 @xmath51 are coordinates of points @xmath29 and @xmath14 in some inertial coordinate system , and @xmath52 is the metric tensor in this coordinate system .    in this case",
    "the points with coordinates @xmath53 and @xmath54 belong to @xmath32-vicinity of the point @xmath55 , whereas @xmath56 , because@xmath57as far as the quantity @xmath58 may be indefinitely large , the distance between the points @xmath29 and @xmath14 may be very large , although both points are near to the point @xmath33 ( @xmath46 and @xmath59 .    in the space - time of minkowski the @xmath32-vicinity of the point",
    "@xmath55 is a region of the space - time between two hyperboloids@xmath60formally the relation ( [ a1.4 ] ) determines a sphere of radius @xmath32 in the space - time of minkowski . at @xmath35",
    "this region turns to the light cone with the vertex at the point @xmath33 .",
    "thus , at @xmath35 in the proper euclidean geometry the @xmath32-vicinity of the point @xmath29 is the same point @xmath29 , whereas in the geometry of minkowski the @xmath32-vicinity of the point @xmath29 is the light cone with the vertex at the point @xmath29 .    in the nonrelativistic physics the @xmath32-vicinity @xmath30 of the point @xmath55",
    "is defined by relations@xmath61 in the limit @xmath35 , the @xmath32-vicinity ( a1.4a ) turns to one point @xmath33 .",
    "thus , in the non - relativistic physics there are only one near point , whereas in the relativistic physics there is a continual set of near points .",
    "this difference appears to be very important in definition of short - range interaction between particles .",
    "let us stress , that introducing cone - shaped @xmath32-vicinity and nearness of points on the light cone to the vertex of the cone , * we do not suggest any hypothesis .",
    "we follow only the relativity principle . *",
    "if we follow the relativity principles , we should accept the fact of the cone - shaped @xmath32-vicinity , because pointlike shape of the @xmath32-vicinity in the limit @xmath35 is a remnant of the nonrelativistic theory .",
