    "following the recent observation of mott insulator  superfluid transition with ultracold atomic bose gases loaded into optical lattices  @xcite , there has been an intense theoretical activity in analyzing many hubbard - type lattice models  @xcite . among them",
    "the two - species bose - hubbard model , which can be studied with two - component bose gases loaded into optical lattices , is one of the most popular .",
    "this is because , in addition to the mott insulator and single - species superfluid phases , it has been predicted that this model has at least two additional phases : an incompressible super - counter flow and a compressible paired superfluid phase  @xcite .",
    "our main interest here is in the latter phase , where a direct transition from the mott insulator to the paired superfluid phase ( superfluidity of composite bosons , i.e. bose - bose pairs ) has been predicted , when both species have integer fillings and the interspecies interaction is sufficiently large and attractive . in this paper",
    ", we derive an analytic mean - field expression for the mott insulator  paired superfluid transition boundary in the two - species bose - hubbard model .",
    "the remaining paper is organized as follows . after introducing the model hamiltonian in sec .",
    "[ sec : tsbh ] , first we derived the mean - field theory in sec .",
    "[ sec : mft ] , and then presented typical phase diagrams in sec .",

    "the two - species bose - hubbard hamiltonian is given by , @xmath0 where the pseudo - spin @xmath1 labels the trapped hyperfine states of a given species of bosons , or labels different types of bosons in a two - species mixture , @xmath2 is the tunneling ( or hopping ) matrix between sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the boson creation ( annihilation ) and @xmath7 is the boson number operator at site @xmath3 , @xmath8 is the strength of the onsite boson - boson interaction between @xmath9 and @xmath10 components , and @xmath11 is the chemical potential . in this manuscript , we consider a @xmath12-dimensional hypercubic lattice , for which we assume @xmath13 is a real symmetric matrix with elements @xmath14 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 nearest neighbors and @xmath15 otherwise .",
    "we take the intraspecies interactions to be repulsive ( @xmath16 ) and the interspecies interaction to be attractive ( @xmath17 such that @xmath18 , to guarantee the stability of the mixture against collapse .    for sufficiently attractive @xmath19 , it is well - established that  @xcite instead of a direct transition from the mott insulator to a single particle superfluid phase , the transition is from the mott insulator to a paired superfluid phase ( superfluidity of composite bosons , i.e. bose - bose pairs ) .",
    "in fact , in the limit when @xmath20 , it can be shown that the transition is from the mott insulator to a paired superfluid phase for all @xmath21  @xcite .      in the single - species bose - hubbard model , the standard mean - field theory , where the boson creation and annihilation operators are approximated by their expectation values , e.g. @xmath22 has proved to be very useful in understanding the qualitative features of the mott insulator ",
    "single species superfluid phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this is simply because the transition is driven by the first - order hopping effects .",
    "however , the mott insulator  paired superfluid transition is driven by the second - order hopping effects , and therefore , the standard mean - field theory is not sufficient .",
    "this difficulty could be overcome by restricting the hamiltonian to the subspace of paired particles , and including the second - order hopping effects through second - order perturbation theory  @xcite .    for the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ebhh ] ) , we have recently calculated the two - particle and two - hole excitation energies ( i.e. energy costs for adding and removing two - particles , respectively ) up to third order in the hoppings .",
    "assuming @xmath23 the two - particle excitation energy was found to be  @xcite @xmath24 z t_\\sigma^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{2(n_\\uparrow+1)(n_\\downarrow+1)}{u_{\\uparrow\\downarrow } } z t_\\uparrow t_\\downarrow,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the coordination number .",

    "( [ eqn : en - tpar ] ) and  ( [ eqn : en - thol ] ) are checked via exact small - cluster ( two - site ) calculations .",
    "in addition , in the limit when @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : en - thol ] ) is in complete agreement with eq .",
    "( 3 ) of ref .  @xcite , providing an independent check of the algebra .",
    "we note that , unlike the usual bose - hubbard model where @xmath34 scales as @xmath35 when @xmath36 , here @xmath34 must scale as @xmath37 when @xmath36 .    given the two - particle and two - hole excitation energies , the mean - field phase boundary for the mott insulator  paired superfluid transition is determined by ( see ref .",

    "( [ eqn : mfe ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( 5 ) of ref .  @xcite ( after setting @xmath45 there ) .",
    "however , the terms that are proportional to @xmath46 are not included in their definitions of the two - particle and two - hole excitation energies .",

    "equation  ( [ eqn : mfmu ] ) is the mean - field expression for the mott insulator  paired superfluid transition boundary , and it is the main result of this paper .      in this section ,",
    "we present typical phase diagrams in the @xmath47 versus @xmath52 plane , obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mfmu ] ) .",
    "similar to the usual bose - hubbard model , as hopping increases from zero , the range of the chemical potential about which the ground state is a mott insulator decreases , and the mott insulator phase disappears at a critical value of hopping , beyond which the system becomes a paired superfluid .",
    "[ htb ]    for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we show the mott insulator  paired superfluid phase transition boundaries for the first lobe , i.e. @xmath53 , when @xmath54 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) , where we set @xmath55 , it is clearly seen that decreasing @xmath56 favors the paired superfluid phase , as intuitively expected .",
    "while in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) , where we set @xmath57 , it is clearly seen that decreasing the strength of @xmath19 favors the mott insulator phase ( see the explanation below ) .",
    "we also note a weak re - entrant quantum phase transition in both of the figures .",
    "in addition , in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we show the mott insulator  paired superfluid phase transition boundaries for the first lobe , i.e. @xmath53 , when @xmath57 . in fig .",

    "[ fig:2](b ) , where we set @xmath59 , it is clearly seen that decreasing the strength of @xmath19 again favors the mott insulator phase .",
    "however , compared to figs .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) and  [ fig:1](b ) , we note that the re - entrant quantum phase transition is much stronger in these figures .",
    "[ htb ]    our results are consistent with the expectation that , for small @xmath19 , the location of the mott insulator tip increases as a function of @xmath19 , because the presence of a nonzero @xmath19 is what allowed this state to form in the first place .",
    "however , when the strength of @xmath19 is larger than some critical value ( approximately @xmath60 ) , the location of the tip decreases , and it eventually vanishes exactly when @xmath61 , which may indicate an instability toward a collapse .",
    "in addition , from eq .",
    "[ eqn : en - thol ] , we expect a re - entrant quantum phase transition when @xmath62 z t_\\sigma^2 < 0 , $ ] which occurs beyond a critical @xmath19 .",
    "when this expression is negative , its value is most negative for the first mott lobe ( i.e. @xmath53 ) , and therefore the effect is strongest there .",
    "however , its value increases and eventually becomes positive as a function of filling , and thus the re - entrant behavior becomes weaker as filling increases , and it eventually disappears beyond a critical filling .",
    "in this paper , by restricting the two - species bose - hubbard hamiltonian to the subspace of paired particles , and using perturbation theory , we derived an analytic mean - field expression for the mott insulator  paired superfluid transition boundary .",
    "we found that , for small @xmath19 , the location of the mott insulator tip increases as a function of @xmath19 , because the presence of a nonzero @xmath19 is what allowed this state to form in the first place .",
    "however , when the strength of @xmath19 is larger than some critical value ( approximately @xmath60 ) , the location of the tip decreases , and it eventually vanishes exactly when @xmath61 , which may indicate an instability toward a collapse . given that the interspecies interaction can be fine tuned in ongoing experiments , e.g. @xmath63k-@xmath64rb  @xcite or homonuclear  @xcite mixtures , via using feshbach resonances , we hope that our predictions could be tested with ultracold atomic systems .",
