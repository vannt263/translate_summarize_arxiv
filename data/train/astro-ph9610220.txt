    "modern cosmology offers the key concepts for understanding how , from an almost homogeneous sea of particles and radiation , the universe developed structures as complex as the galaxies , clusters and super clusters of galaxies that we observe today . at this point",
    ", it appears logical to question ourselves about the natural initial conditions that cosmology could provide for the astrophysical processes of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this question would result interesting only if the present structure of galaxies retained some information related to the cosmological physical conditions prevalent at the epochs when galactic seeds appeared ; that is , if strong dissipative processes did not totally erase the initial cosmological conditions . if this were the case",
    ", the following question immediately arises : is it possible to establish a link between cosmological models and the properties of galaxies seen today ?",
    "it is the aim of this work to find precisely such a link , using for this purpose a galactic evolutionary theory .",
    "the mayor ingredient relevant to the problem of structure and galaxy formation is the prediction from cosmology of an initial fluctuation type and distribution .",
    "the most popular cosmological approach , due to its simplicity and predictive capability , is the inflationary cold dark matter model @xmath0 including their variants , and the usual assumption is that the primordial fluctuations have a gaussian distribution ( is it really a solid prediction of the inflationary models ? ) , with a scale invariant density contrast .",
    "once a gaussian nature is assumed for the density fluctuation field , its statistical properties can be determined in terms only of the fluctuation power spectrum @xmath1 .",
    "it has become customary to compare different cosmological scenarios at the level of their respective power spectra , linearly extrapolated to @xmath2 . in this way , at some epoch , say the recombination time , one has the initial conditions for structure and galaxy formation .    the normalization of this @xmath3 is not provided by the theory , and has been estimated on intermediate scales by the galaxy distribution and , more recently , at very large scales , by the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xmath4 .",
    "the link we shall establish between cosmological models and the properties of galaxies , indeed offers a method to find the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations at the smallest cosmological relevant regions the galactic scales . in this way",
    ", the different @xmath3 predicted by distinct cosmological models and normalized to the @xmath5 measurements , can be tested using galactic evolution , at the smallest scales , where maximal variations among them typically occur .",
    "our goal is to find the typical formation redshift @xmath6 of galaxies with a given mass @xmath7 , using for this the galactic evolutionary theory . here",
    "we treat galactic evolution within the framework introduced in firmani et al .",
    "the global evolutionary models presented there are based on the local ones developed by firmani & tutukov ( 1992 , 1994 ) .    the initial conditions from which the global models start include a spherical distribution of @xmath8 , and @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11",
    ", they predict the properties of a late type galaxy as seen today .",
    "we pay special attention to the tully - fisher relation and the constant central surface brightness pointed out by freeman ( 1970 ) , because they seem to be more directly related to the cosmological conditions .",
    "it is very difficult to obtain an explicit solution to the problem of non - linear evolution of the primordial density fluctuations and the resulting @xmath8 halo structures ( see for example flores &  primack ( 1994 ) , moore ( 1994 ) , klypin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ) . in order to avoid complicated dynamical calculations",
    "which in any case involve statistical uncertain primordial density fluctuation profiles , in the frame of our simplified approach , we assume that , during the non - linear evolution of the density fluctuations , a violent relaxation virializes the @xmath8 halo to a truncated isothermal sphere with a core ( binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) , bachall & soneira ( 1980 ) ) .",
    "we also experimented with alternative halo profiles ( e.g. katz ( 1991 ) ) .",
    "the density profile parameters of the virialized halo can be easily related through energy conservation to the radius of the primordial fluctuation at the maximum expansion , if a @xmath12 configuration is assumed for this phase .",
    "this relation reduces the degree of freedom of the virialized halo configuration to one , which we fix in order to obtain a flat rotation curve at the end of the evolution .",
    "this simple procedure allows us to construct a virialized halo starting from @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "one assumes that after the virialization of the @xmath8 halo , all the baryonic gas trapped in it , cools and falls to the center forming a centrifugally supported disk where the stellar populations form , evolve , and interact with the interstellar medium . here",
    "the disk mass fraction , in principle , may be assumed equal to the fraction of baryonic matter @xmath13 which is well predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "the initial angular momentum , measured by the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath14 , is taken from the tidal torque theory and numerical simulations ( peebles 1969 , fall &   efstathiou ( 1980 ) , efstathiou &  barnes ( 1987 ) ) , having an average value of @xmath15 .",
    "we do not consider the possibility of mayor mergers after the galactic disk is formed . since",
    "late type galaxies are typically field objects , or located at cluster peripheries , we think this last assumption is quite reasonable .",
    "now , given a total mass @xmath7 and following the above stated assumptions of a final flat rotation curve and a baryon content close to the bbn prescription , one selects those models which satisfy , through the galactic evolution , the tully - fisher relation ( normalized to the galaxy ) and the freeman law .",
    "this procedure fixes @xmath6 and @xmath14 completely .",
    "the results , obtained using an isothermal halo , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are plotted in fig.1 ( continuous line ) .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , the mass roughly scales with @xmath6 as @xmath18 at galactic scales . on other hand , it is possible to estimate such a relation for the hierarchical models , using for this the press - schechter formalism ( press &  schechter ( 1974 ) ) . in fig .",
    "1 we also show the average @xmath6 of collapsed objects with masses @xmath7 for a @xmath19-normalized standard @xmath20 power spectrum .",
    "the rather good agreement found between our predictions of galaxy formation epochs and the press - schechter formalism applied to a standard @xmath20 cosmology is quite encouraging of the validity of our approach .",
    "we feel it is now safe to state that the tully - fisher scale relationship and the constant central disk brightness found by freeman are the fossil remains of the physical conditions prevalent during the epoch of galaxy formation . that the slope of the tully - fisher relation is related to the cosmological conditions",
    "was previously suggested ( e.g. faber ( 1981 ) ) , but the proportionality coefficient was not considered .",
    "it is encouraging that we obtain the same value for @xmath14 which the numerical simulations predict .",
    "inverting the procedure , if we fix @xmath21 , we can predict a disk mass fraction @xmath22 @xmath23 , which results close to the value predicted by the bbn .",
    "several experiments with alternative halo profiles have been taken into consideration , with poor results in terms of final rotation curves .",
    "from galactic evolution we were able to determine the formation redshifts of galaxies .",
    "now , using the press - schechter formalism in reverse , and the spherical collapse model , it is straightforward to find the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations at galactic scales .",
    "in fig.2 we plot the @xmath3 obtained from galactic evolution at wave numbers between @xmath24 and @xmath25 . also plotted are several observational estimates on larger scales and theoretical @xmath19-normalized power spectra ( from stompor et al .",
    "it is clearly seen that our results are a natural small scale extension of the @xmath3 estimated from galaxy distribution observations .",
    "though it is still early to claim definitive results , we find our approach useful for constraining cosmological models at galactic scales . as was pointed out by wambsganss et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , since cosmological models have an assumed @xmath3 that is normalized to pass through the region measured by the @xmath19 satellite at very large scales , and given that the slope of the @xmath3 is a model - dependent feature , then the maximal variations among them naturally occur at the smallest scales ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the relevance of finding further estimates of the primordial fluctuation amplitude on scales as far removed as possible from the @xmath19 measurements , for example galactic scales , is at this point obvious .",
    "we can summarize the results of this work as follows :    \\1 ) the density fluctuation @xmath3 inferred from galactic evolutionary models defines a sequence in the range @xmath26which shows itself as the natural extension of the estimates obtained from the observations of galaxy distribution .",
    "\\2 ) the tully - fisher relation ( both , the slope and the proportionality coefficient ) and the constant central brightness of late type galaxies appear to be consequences of the cosmological origin of galaxies .",
    "both relations may be considered fossil information of the primordial density fluctuation field .",
    "\\3 ) on the frame of a gaussian distribution of the primordial density fluctuations , our results show in the fluctuation spectrum less power than the standard @xmath20 model , and lean slightly towards @xmath20 models with a non - vanishing cosmological constant .",
