    "in order to confirm that the best variational model does not have an optical absorption that tends to a delta function at strong coupling i propose the following ansatz for @xmath41 : @xmath44 the resulting optical conductivity will have a peak at @xmath45 and the width of the peak will be @xmath40 . because of the @xmath46 term the model energy diverges , however the expected model influence phase also diverges so that the total contribution of the model is finite : @xmath47=\\frac{3}{2\\pi } \\left(\\delta + \\frac{\\omega_0}{\\sqrt{1-(\\delta/2\\omega_0)^2}}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\delta/2\\omega_0}{\\sqrt{1-(\\delta/2\\omega_0)^2}}\\right ) \\right ) \\right),\\ ] ] whenever @xmath48 .",
    "we are only interested in the strong coupling limit which implies @xmath49 .",
    "so asymptotically we find @xmath50 .",
    "next we need the contribution of the self energy .",
    "let us , similar to the weak coupling expansion , expand both @xmath51 and the exponential around @xmath52 , i.e. we rewrite the green function as @xmath53 and expand the result in @xmath54 . the zeroth order green function is given by @xmath55 hence it s contribution to the self - energy is @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the gamma function .",
    "for large @xmath58 this becomes @xmath59 the first order correction is given by @xmath60 it seems like this integral can not be done analytically in general . at strong",
    "coupling one can however make some approximations . for sufficiently large @xmath58",
    "one can approximate @xmath61 .",
    "next all integrals can be done .",
    "systematically keeping only terms to order @xmath62 yields only a single contribution , i.e. @xmath63 the total energy thus becomes @xmath64 there will thus be a finite value of the width @xmath40 if @xmath65 optimizing with respect to @xmath40 we have @xmath66 substituting this back into expression and optimizing with respect to @xmath58 yields @xmath67 consequently the width behaves as @xmath68 note that the variational energy only changes to @xmath69 .",
    "clearly the optimal width in this very simple model already tends to a finite value at large @xmath23 and not to zero .",
    "note that this is only possible because @xmath70 .",
    "if we were to do an adiabatic calculation , i.e. calculate @xmath58 from the landau - pekar ansatz , then @xmath71 .",
    "hence within the adiabatic ( born - oppenheimer ) approximation the frequency would make the linear term in @xmath40 vanish so that the optimal linewidth @xmath52 . incorporating non - adiabatic effects results in slightly lower excitation frequency @xmath58 .",
    "the linewidth is directly proportional to the difference between the adiabatic and the real excitation frequency .",
    "the result clearly shows the relation between dissipation and non - adiabaticity .",
    "by analytically continuating the euclidian green function we find the following expression for it in terms of the optical absorption @xmath72 since we have numerically calculated the left hand side , finding @xmath73 is just a matter of solving a linear equation .",
    "before i go on let me just show that this is numerically ill defined . solving a linear equation is formally identical to minimizing the total square of the error .",
    "it s instructive to minimize the error on the derivative of @xmath51 rather then on @xmath51 itself . minimizing the error @xmath74 with respect to @xmath73 yields @xmath75 here",
    "@xmath76 is the laplace transform of @xmath77 . when discretized on an equidistant grid the above problem results in the problem of inverting a hilbert matrix .",
    "the determinant of this matrix asymptotically scales like @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the number of grid point .",
    "the latter implies eigenvalues are at least exponentially small in the number of grid points .",
    "if we wish to have any accuracy we need to numerically know the green function to the same ( exponential ) precision . note that this is just another way of observing why the ground state energy is not sensitive to detailed dynamical properties .",
    "the exponentially small eigenvalues imply that a lot of @xmath73 will give a very good fit to @xmath51 , in the sense that @xmath80 will be very small .",
    "it thus becomes a matter of selecting the physical solution out of a set of , to numerical accuracy , degenerate solutions . in order to solve this problem one generally resorts to maximum entropy methods",
    "the idea is to introduce a penalty for solutions that are to far away from a ( smooth ) prior distribution .",
    "this introduces an extra parameter into the problem .",
    "if one regards the distance @xmath81 as the energy one should in principle look for the ground state of this but in the maximum entropy method ( mem ) you look for states that minimize free energy .",
    "the temperature is the extra degree of freedom .",
    "here i obtained the absorption in the following way .",
    "first of all i subtract the linear contribution to the green function , as this results in a delta function at @xmath82 .",
    "in fact i fix the effective mass to @xmath83 and only numerically look for @xmath73 at finite frequency .",
    "next i define the distance @xmath84 where @xmath85 and i take @xmath86 to be a normal distribution with a fixed width , at present its variance is 1 . in this way",
    "the ansatz @xmath87 satisfies the f - sum rule and its resolution is low compared to the underlying grid . minimizing @xmath88 with respect to @xmath58 results in the best gaussian fit to the absorption spectrum .",
    "however , at this point one can argue that similar to mem one can take a thermal state of @xmath81 rather then the ground state",
    ". therefore i write @xmath89 the partition function can be fixed by the f - sum rule .",
    "furthermore the temperature can be fixed by the ground state energy sum rule  @xcite .",
    "note that the temperature is now a direct measure for the quality of the fit . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] , the temperature reaches a maximum in the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "the present numerical results should thus be most accurate at weak and strong coupling .",

    "<S> moreover , the correction to the ground state energy is only of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> a clear indication that the fully self consistent numeric result should have a finite width for the absorption peak in the large coupling limit .    </S>",
    "<S> a detailed comparison between the numerical and feynman s memory function furthermore reveals that the low frequency behaviour of the optimal memory function @xmath12 is completely consistent with feynman s . </S>",

    "<S> the resulting absorption is depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> in contrast to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which shows excellent agreement of the peak position with dqmc data , the present spectra have maximum absorption at slightly to high frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is consistent with the strong coupling adiabatic expansion using gaussian wave functions  @xcite . at strong coupling </S>",
    "<S> there are quantum fluctuations which can not be captured to first - order by any quadratic ( gaussian ) model .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , there always exists a quadratic generalized feynman lagrangian that has the same optical conductivity as the real system . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from thornbers arguments in  @xcite that the jensen - feynman inequality can not be used to find this </S>",
    "<S> _ exact _ absorption spectrum . nevertheless , decent agreement between the dqmc absorption and the optimal feynman approximation is found . </S>",
    "<S> however , the main message of this paper might be one of caution . </S>",
    "<S> no matter how close you get the free energy of a model calculation to the exact result , one might completely miss the actual physics of the problem .    at present </S>",
    "<S> the model lagrangian does give the dynamical behaviour of the system and so , in contrast to the approach of fhip , the results are accurate without perturbative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> finally it was shown that the weak coupling result is identical to that in  @xcite , providing indirect evidence for the correctness of those results .    </S>",
    "<S> given the simplicity of the present method it seems likely that this can be combined with quantum monte carlo calculations to improve their convergence . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the dynamics of quantum systems with quadratic actions is identical to their classical dynamics , a diagrammatic expansion around the optimal quadratic lagrangian would truly separate quantum events from the effective classical dynamics . </S>",
