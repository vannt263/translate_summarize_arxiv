    "a long series of investigations reviewd by weymann , carswell & smith ( 1981 ) ( see bergeron & boiss 1991 , steidel _ et al . _  1997 ,",
    "et al . _  1999 for a current update",
    ") has established that when the hi column density is sufficiently large ( @xmath3 atoms @xmath4 ) , ly@xmath0 absorption seen in the spectra of qsos is often accompanied by absorption in the civ doublet at 1550 . at somewhat higher column densities (",
    "@xmath5 atoms @xmath4 ) , c ii , si ii , al ii , fe ii , and mg ii are often detected .",
    "furthermore , the origin of the low - ionization absorbing gas can usually be identified as a luminous galaxy whose redshift matches that of the absorbing gas and which has an impact parameter of @xmath6 kpc with respect to the qso .",
    "_  ( 1998 ) present recent results on identifying the galaxies that give rise to the lower column density ly@xmath0 forest absorption .",
    "such studies are a key way of probing gas in the outer regions of galaxies .",
    "the damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ) are those rare cases with the highest hi column densities , @xmath7 atoms @xmath4 .",
    "it is thus somewhat puzzling that one of the nearest dlas , the system with @xmath2 seen in the spectrum of the qso oi 363 , remains unidentified .",
    "this dla was discovered by rao & turnshek ( 1998 ) ( henceforth rt ) during a large survey program to scrutinize hst spectra of qsos taken in the uv described in rao & turnshek ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , they were unable to identify the galaxy producing the absorption . by chance",
    "there is a second dla in the spectrum of this qso , at @xmath8 , and they were also unable to establish the origin of this dla .",
    "the hi from these two systems has been detected in absorption at 21 cm by lane _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) and by chengalar & kanekar ( 1999 ) .",
    "rao & turnshek ( 1998 ) present a deep image of the field of this qso , and obtained a spectrum of the brightest galaxy within 30 arcsec of the qso ( galaxy g11 , using their identifications - see figure 4 of their paper ) , which shows pronounced spiral arms .",
    "galaxy g11 turned out to be a foreground object at @xmath9 not associated with either of the dla systems .",
    "the most likely remaining candidate for the dla , identified in the deep imaging survey of le brun _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1993 ) , was too faint for them to obtain a spectrum .",
    "they state that with the elimination of g11 , there is no candidate galaxy bright enough to produce these two dla systems , and that this indicates an inconsistency with the standard model developed by prochaska & wolfe ( 1998 ) for dlas arising in large hi disks of galaxies .",
    "i have obtained spectra of the two next brightest candidates within 30 arcsec of the qso with the hope of identifying the absorbing galaxy in each of the two low-@xmath10 dla systems seen in the qso oi 363 .",
    "the properties of the four brightest galaxies near this qso are listed in table 1 . a more complete census of the galaxies near oi",
    "363 can be found in rt .",
    "i have established that the @xmath8 dla system originates in galaxy g1 which is only 6 arcsec from the qso .",
    "this is the galaxy suggested as the possible dla host by le brun _ et al . _  ( 1993 ) .",
    "the measured redshift of this galaxy from a 1500 sec exposure taken on march 6 , 2000 with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( oke _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) at the keck observatory using a 1.5 arcsec slit with a 300 g / mm grating ( spectral resolution 15 ) is @xmath1 .",
    "the luminosity of g1 is @xmath11 ( 1/7 @xmath12 ) .. km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13and @xmath14 the impact parameter with respect to the qso is 13@xmath15 kpc .",
    "the spectrum of g1 is shown in figure  1 .",
    "absorption in the h+k doublet of caii is strong , and a pronounced 4000  break is seen , as well as the g band of ch and the ultraviolet cn band .",
    "no emission lines were detected , with an upper limit to the equivalent width for the 5007   [ oiii ] line of 5  , and that for h@xmath0 of 10  .",
    "the snr in the continuum per spectral resolution element is 45 at about 4885   ( rest frame 3990  ) and @xmath1637 at rest frame 3790 , i.e. just above and below the h+k doublet .",
    "the origin of the absorption for the @xmath2 dla system is still unclear .",
    "galaxy g10 is probably associated with this gas in some way , but is not directly the source .",
    "this galaxy , which rt describe as an `` early type galaxy '' , is 28 arcsec from the qso .",
    "the color of g10 is somewhat bluer in @xmath17 than that of g11 ( monet _ et al . _  1999 ) .",
    "the redshift of g10 is @xmath18 . with this redshift",
    ", g10 has an impact parameter of @xmath19 kpc and a luminosity of @xmath20 ( 1/14 @xmath12 ) .",
    "its spectrum ( a 1000 sec exposure with the same instrumental configuration as for g1 ) is also shown in figure  1 .",
    "it appears similar to that of g1 , but the 3968   line is stronger relative to that at 3933  than in galaxy g1 .",
    "the g band of ch appears to be present in the spectrum of g10 .",
    "the [ oii ] emission line at 3727is beyond the blue end of the spectrum ; the range is 4200 to 8900  .",
    "the snr here in the continuum per spectral resolution element is between 35 and 40 at wavelengths just below and just above the h+k doublet of caii .",
    "there is a possible detection of h@xmath0 with an equivalent width of @xmath163  .",
    "the velocity difference between g10 and the dla itself is uncomfortably large ( @xmath164000 km  s@xmath13 ) and g10 itself can not be the origin of the dla absorption .",
    "thus the three brightest galaxies within 30 arcsec of the qso , g1 , g10 and g11 , have now been observed spectroscopically , and none appear to be the source for this dla gas . the next brightest galaxy ,",
    "assuming that no mistake was made by rt in separating stars from galaxies , within this area is more than a magnitude fainter than g1 , which is the faintest of the three already observed spectroscopically .",
    "( the field is at a rather low galactic latitutde ( @xmath21 ) , so there are many stars in this magnitude range as well . )",
    "perhaps g10 is a member of a cluster , and one of the other galaxies in that group is the actual host for the absorbing gas .",
    "hopefully planned future observations of some of the fainter galaxies nearer the qso than g10 will reveal the culprit for this dla shortly , but the upper limit on its luminosity is now constrained to be ( 1/30 @xmath12 ) .",
    "as emphasized by steidel , dickinson & persson ( 1994 ) , all normal field galaxies can give rise to qso absorption lines , albeit generally of lower total column density than those characteristic of dlas .",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) find that in the regime @xmath22 any galaxy over a wide range of morphological types , from late spirals to s0s , with @xmath23 can produce mgii absorption and an associated ly@xmath0 forest line .",
    "the hi column densities required for a dla system are , however , several orders of magnitude higher",
    ".    identifications are available for a few other low-@xmath10 dlas .",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) have established that the galaxy responsible for the @xmath24 absorption in the spectrum of qso 0850 + 4400 is a moderate luminosity ( @xmath25 ) s0 galaxy . however , the hi column density for this system ( log@xmath26 ) is just below the cutoff normally adopted for dlas .",
    "the closest known dla , studied by miller , knezak & bregman ( 1999 ) , arises in the outer part of ngc 4203 , with ton 1480 as the background qso .",
    "ngc 4203 is an isolated e3 galaxy ( de vaucouleurs , de vaucouleurs & corwin 1976 ) with @xmath27 , which corresponds roughly to @xmath28 .",
    "even though the sample is small , it is clear that gas rich galaxies with extensive current star formation and with luminosities @xmath29 are not the dominant origins of the low-@xmath10 dla systems .",
    "galaxies of moderate luminosity and without obvious signs of high gas content from their optical morphology or spectra appear to give rise to dla systems when there is a background qso at a suitable impact parameter .",
    "a possible origin for dla gas is low luminosity , gas rich dwarf galaxies such as the local group member ngc 6822 , which has a large hi halo with a mass of about 1.5@xmath30 m  in hi ( roberts 1972 ) in spite of its low luminosity of @xmath31 .",
    "however , the admittedly small sample of known low-@xmath10 dla galaxies are not gas rich dwarfs .    at intermediate redshift , many dla candidates are identified from hst imaging surveys , with few spectroscopic confirmations .",
    "le brun _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1997 ) and steidel _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) suggest that the most probable dla candidates are galaxies of moderate luminosity .",
    "the latter group finds that the probable identification for the dla with @xmath32 along the line of sight to pks 0454 + 0356 has @xmath33 , corresponding to @xmath34 , ignoring any evolution in luminosity of @xmath35 with redshift .    at high redshift",
    ", the suggestion that dlas arise in dwarf galaxies has been made by york _",
    "et al . _  ( 1986 ) , and more recently by matteucci , molaro & vladilo ( 1997 ) , while jimenez , bowen & matteuci ( 1999 ) have suggested low surface brightness galaxies as the culprits .",
    "on the other hand , mcdonald & miralda - escude ( 1999 ) and haehnelt , steinmetz & rauch ( 1998 ) view the dlas at high redshift as resulting from the formation of protogalaxies and ascribe the velocity widths to turbulence , rather than ordered motions in normal rotating galactic disks .",
    "ground baesd long slit spectroscopy at rest - frame h@xmath0 and hst imaging ( bunker _ et al . _  1999 and",
    "kulkarni _ et al . _  2000 ,",
    "respectively ) demonstrate that suspected dla absorbers at high redshift appear to have small sizes and low star formation rates .",
    "thus the model of prochaska & wolfe ( 1998 ) of massive rotating disks does not correspond to the observed properties of most of the galaxies that give rise to dla systems at low redshift , and this may also hold true at high redshift .",
    "the fact that the identifications for low-@xmath10 dla systems seem to be low luminosity galaxies which are not starbursts or other very gas rich systems is rather unexpected .",
    "it implies that searches for the galaxies producing dla systems at high redshift will be quite difficult , as unveiling the right galaxy from the projection through a long line of sight of the galaxy luminosity function will not be easy .",
    "furthermore , since the majority of field galaxies occur in groups out to at least @xmath36 ( cohen _ et al . _  2000 ) , one may misidentify the distant dla gas with a galaxy which is in fact not the true source of the gas , but some brighter member of the same group or cluster .",
    "perhaps the selection effects attributed to dust discussed by ostriker & heisler ( 1984 ) and applied to dla systems in particular by fall & pei ( 1993 ) and most recently by boiss _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) are responsible .",
    "they suggest that the higher mean extinction within massive galaxies with high dust content and high metallicity act to limit our ability to detect the background qsos . since dust absorption is higher in the uv , another consequence of dust would be a limitation in our ability to obtain uv spectra of the background qsos to identify the absorption line systems , an effect dependent on @xmath10(qso ) ",
    "@xmath10(dla ) .",
    "such a selection effect would skew the probability that a galaxy produces a detectable dla system away from one based only on the galaxy s gas column density and impact parameter to the qso .",
    "another consequence of dust might be to bias calculations based on qso absorption features of the contribution of the neutral gas to the cosmological mass density .",
    "if the next few identifications of low-@xmath10 dla systems continue to be low luminosity galaxies , these selection effects due to dust may be playing an important role .",
    "the entire keck / lris user community owes a huge debt to jerry nelson , gerry smith , bev oke , and many other people who have worked to make the keck telescope and lris a reality .",
    "we are grateful to the w. m. keck foundation , and particularly its late president , howard keck , for the vision to fund the construction of the w. m. keck observatory .",
    "i thank c.steidel and the anonymous referee for helpful comments ."
