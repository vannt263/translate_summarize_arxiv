    "flocking is a prevalent behavior of most population in natural world such as bacteria , birds , fishes .",
    "it is also widespread in some phenomena in physics , for example interacting oscillators .",
    "recently , a number of articles proposed mathematical models for flocking behavior , to name a few @xcite .",
    "vicsek and collaborators @xcite presented a model ( for convenience , we call it vicsek s model ) and then studied flocking behavior via computer simulations .",
    "some theoretical results on the convergence of that model can be found in @xcite .",
    "based on the vicsek s model , cucker and smale introduced a model for an @xmath0-particle system @xcite . then , some mathematicians called it the cucker - smale system @xcite .",
    "we will recall here some features of this system .",
    "we consider motion of @xmath0 particles in the space @xmath1 .",
    "the position of the @xmath2-th particle is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "its velocity is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the cucker - smale system is as follows @xmath5 here , the weights @xmath6 quantify the influence between @xmath2-th and @xmath7-th particles .",
    "this communication rate is a nonincreasing function @xmath8 of the distances between particles .",
    "this function has various forms . in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath9 while in @xcite , @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 . for such functions",
    ", it is shown that when @xmath13 the convergence of the velocities to a common velocity is guaranteed , while for @xmath14 this convergence is guaranteed under some condition on the initial positions and velocities of particles .",
    "we call them unconditional flocking and conditional flocking , respectively . in the latter case ,",
    "the result on the non - flocking for two particles on a line is also stated @xcite .",
    "we know that real systems are often exposed to influences that are incompletely understood . therefore extending these deterministic models to ones that embrace more complicated variations is needed .",
    "a way of doing that is including stochastic influences or noise .",
    "up to our knowledge , however , there are few such models which are studied theoretically @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "cucker and mordecki modified the model in @xmath15 by adding random noise to it @xmath16 here communication rate @xmath17 has the same form as that in .",
    "@xmath18 is a three - dimensional gausian centered , stationary stochastic process , that satisfies a @xmath19-dependence condition for some @xmath20 , i.e. , two sets @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent for each @xmath23 .",
    "and @xmath18 has @xmath24 trajectories and independent coordinates .",
    "the authors showed that a conditional @xmath25-nearly flocking occurs in finite time with a confidence which is similar to the conditional flocking of the deterministic system .",
    "that is , for @xmath26 small enough , there exists a time @xmath27 depending on @xmath25 and initial values @xmath28 such that for every @xmath29 , @xmath30 with a positive probability .",
    "this probability , however , is not one and the interval time for the occurring is not @xmath31 . in other words , it is just nearly flocking , not flocking . in another approach ,",
    "ha and collaborators @xcite studied the following two cucker - smale systems with the presence of white noise : @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a constant vector . in @xcite , the result on the flocking behavior of system is exhibited when the communication rate is a constant .",
    "furthermore , if the communication rate satisfies a lower bound condition , then the relative fluctuations of velocities around a mean velocity have a uniformly bounded variance in time . in @xcite , by giving another definition for flocking which is relative to almost surely convergence , the authors showed flocking of system which covers the case of the communication weight employed by cucker - smale .",
    "we are interested in the communication rate term in system . what happens if this mutual communication is affected by random factor , i.e. , @xmath35 + white noise ?",
    "this motivates us to present and study a cucker - smale system under the effect of a common white noise on the mutual communication .",
    "we will show that if the noise is large then there is no flocking .",
    "even if the communication rate satisfies the unconditional flocking for , this still holds true .",
    "this is different from the deterministic cucker - smale system but is adaptive to real situations .",
    "for example , under a strongly random effect of strong winds or water currents , birds or fishes will separate and can not make a flock or school . in contrast , we will show that if the noise is small enough , then flocking occurs . for the convenience of calculation , we will use the stratonovich stochastic differential equations .",
    "our model to study in this paper has the form @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the strength of white noise and @xmath38 is one - dimensional brownian motion defined on a complete probability space with normal filtration @xmath39 .",
    "we assume that communication rate function @xmath40 is locally lipschitz continuous .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we prove the existence and uniqueness of global solution to . in section 3 ,",
    "non - flocking under the effect of large noise is shown .",
    "in contrast , in section 4 , we exhibit flocking under the effect of small noise .",
    "finally , some numerical examples are presented in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we shall prove global existence of solution for the system .",
    "[ th1 ] for any given initial values @xmath41 system has a unique and global solution .",
    "since the functions on the right side of are locally lipschitz continuous on @xmath42 there is a unique solution @xmath43 defined on an interval @xmath44 where @xmath45 and if @xmath46 it is an explosion time @xcite , i.e. , @xmath47<\\infty \\}.\\ ] ] put @xmath48 it follows from system that @xmath49 then almost surely @xmath50 and @xmath51 for every @xmath52 without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath53 .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath111 from the above results , we conclude that the particles flock .",
    "the lower bound condition has been used for the system by ha et al . @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that when this condition holds true , the term @xmath112 is uniformly bounded in @xmath113 furthermore , when @xmath114 , flocking of particles takes place .",
    "however , when @xmath17 satisfies the lower bound condition but is not a constant , the flocking result has not yet obtained in @xcite .",
    "[ remark5 ] the above flocking result is relative to the expectation ( average ) of solution .",
    "we can obtain a result on flocking of almost surely convergence that is valid for individual trajectory . to see that , firstly , we change the first condition in definition [ def1 ] by @xmath115 a.s .",
    "now , it follows from that @xmath116 as @xmath93 a.s .",
    "thus @xmath117 it then follows from that for @xmath118 , @xmath119 it means that flocking occurs .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to see from that still holds true for the case @xmath120 .",
    "this means that flocking occurs without the assumptions on the positivity of @xmath121 and upper boundedness of @xmath78 .",
    "consequently , unconditional flocking occurs not only for the communication rate @xmath17 in @xcite but for those in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present some results of numerical simulations based on euler s method for the system .",

    "figure 2 shows a flock of @xmath136 particles at @xmath137 .",
    "each vector shows position and direction of motion of each particle .",
    "the lengths of vectors represent the magnitudes of velocity vectors of particles .",
    "this paper presented a new stochastic version of the cucker - smale model in which the mutual communication between individuals is affected by the common random factor .",
    "this model can find its applications in real world because almost every real phenomena are subject to environmental noises . under the upper bound condition of communication rate",
    ", we show that if the noise is large then the particles can not flock .",
    "this is consistent with some situations in nature , for example , under a strongly random effect , there is no flock . in contrast , under the lower bound condition of communication rate and small noise ,",
    "flocking occurs .",
    "the paper ends with some numerical examples of both flocking and non - flocking .    using the sense of flocking stated in remark [ remark5 ] ,",
    "unconditional flocking takes place .",
    "however , a remaining interesting problem for the stochastic cucker - smale model is to obtain flocking results in the sense of definition [ def1 ] . by numerical simulations",
    ", we predict that flocking in this case does not only depend on small noise but on some certain domain of initial values @xmath138 this problem is left for our future research .",
