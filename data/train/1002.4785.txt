    "inflation is the most consistent model to explain the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , and also the origin of the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe .",
    "as the universe evolves , there is , in addition , a production of a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves ( gw ) , originated from the vacuum fluctuations .    in what follows",
    ", we set a phenomenological model for unifying the transition from the inflationary era to the subsequent radiation dominated epoch of the universe . in particular , we consider a way to extend the framework of the generalised chaplygin gas ( gcg)@xcite to the primordial evolution of the universe .",
    "this transition is not well understood and it is important to investigate the possible signatures in the power spectrum of the stochastic background of gw associated with it , giving a new insight on the inflationary model behind the accelerated expansion in the early universe .",
    "this unification is achieved by considering a perfect fluid whose energy density , @xmath0 , has a dependence on the scale factor , @xmath1 , of the form @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 are constants determined by the matter content of the universe , and @xmath4 is a free parameter . the conditions , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , lead to the expected interpolation .",
    "the conservation of @xmath0 implies the following equation of state @xmath7",
    "the inflationary dynamics of this model can be described by a scalar field , @xmath8 , rolling down its self - interacting potential , @xmath9 .",
    "this potential can be obtained by identifying @xmath0 and @xmath10 of the fluid with those of the scalar field . on the other hand , the number of e - folds of expansion since a given mode @xmath11 exits the horizon ( @xmath12 ) during the inflationary era , at @xmath13 , until the end of inflation can be approximated by @xmath14 .",
    "the model can be constrained using cmbr / lss recent measurements .",
    "more precisely , with the values@xcite @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the power spectrum and spectral index of the scalar perturbations , respectively , evaluated at the pivot wave number @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the energy scale for inflation can be determined through the amplitude of the power spectrum for density perturbations , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 . on the other hand , we can analyse the variation of the scalar to tensor ratio , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the tensorial power spectrum , in terms of the spectral index of the scalar perturbations@xcite @xmath22 .",
    "there are two approaches to evaluate @xmath23 and @xmath24 : one using the number of e - folds , @xmath25 , and the other one by means of the comoving wavenumber , @xmath12 .",
    "the results are presented on the @xmath26 parameter space in fig .",
    "1-a , where we see that the parameter space is slightly more red than preferred by the observation ( blue area ) . however , fig .",
    "1-a also shows that @xmath27 which is in agreement with the observation@xcite .",
    "the most consistent value of @xmath4 with the observation is @xmath28 , corresponding to an energy scale for inflation of @xmath29 gev .",
    "the gw spectrum can be calculated using the method of the continuous bogoliubov coefficients , @xmath4 and @xmath30@xcite .",
    "the dimensionless relative logarithmic energy of the spectrum of the gws , @xmath31 , at the present time @xmath32 , is related to@xcite @xmath30 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is proportional to the number of gravitons created and @xmath35 is the respective angular frequency .",
    "the same coefficient can be written in terms of two continuous functions of time , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which obey the differential equation@xcite @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "as initial conditions for the numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ gweq ] ) ; i.e. the initial values for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we use the exact analytical solution for a ds universe@xcite because our model is quasi - sitter in the past . for the late - time evolution",
    "we use the lcdm model defined through the recent measurements of wmap5 .    in fig .",
    "1-b we present the gw spectra resulting from the numerical integrations using the number of e - folds to constrain the inflationary scale . as can be noticed , the spectrum changes with @xmath4 , with a simultaneous vertical displacement and a variation in the high frequency region . the decrease of the plateau height , which can be observed by the difference between the solid lines ( @xmath42 ) and the dashed lines ( @xmath43 ) for a constant @xmath4 ( a given colour ) , is easily interpreted as a decrease in the inflationary scale . on the other hand , we immediately conclude that the increase in the high frequency region , when @xmath4 moves away from @xmath44 , is a function of the parameter @xmath4 only .",
    "parameter space , using the number of e - folds of @xmath45 in blue , and @xmath46 in purple , or from the comoving wavenumber , @xmath11 , in red .",
    "the black lines are for a constant @xmath4-value , parameterised by an increase in the number of e - folds . fig .",

    "the gw spectra reveal a consistent picture corresponding to the described smooth transition , and represents a significant signature of this modified generalised chaplygin gas .",
    "the strong variation of the high frequency range , is directly related with the decrease in the maximum of the potential @xmath47 , when @xmath4 approaches @xmath44 .",
    "this issue shows the strong limits to the maximum frequency accepted in our model and which will be within the reach of future gravitational - waves detectors like bbo and decigo@xcite , for the khz range of frequencies .",
    "in fact , for the most consistent values of the @xmath4-parameter , the spectrum shows a frequency as low as in the hz region .",
