    "over the past two decades , kohn - sham density functional theory ( ks - dft ) @xcite has become a very popular electronic structure method for molecular and solid - state systems , due to its computational efficiency and reasonable accuracy .",
    "although the exact exchange - correlation ( xc ) density functional @xmath0 $ ] in ks - dft remains unknown , accurate approximations to @xmath0 $ ] have been continuously developed to extend the applicability of ks - dft to a wide range of systems @xcite .",
    "the hierarchy of approximations to @xmath0 $ ] has been formulated as a _",
    "jacob s ladder _ connecting the earth ( hartree theory ) to the heaven ( chemical accuracy ) @xcite .",
    "the first rung of the ladder is the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , representing the xc energy density by the local density .",
    "going beyond the lda , there has been an increasing interest in the  parameter - free \" functionals developed by perdew and co - workers , such as pbe @xcite and tpss @xcite , demonstrating the usefulness of these functionals . as lda , pbe , and tpss",
    "belong to the first , second , and third rungs of the ladder , respectively , they systematically improve upon the description of short - range xc effects by climbing up the ladder ( with slightly increasing computational costs ) .",
    "however , due to the lack of accurate treatment of nonlocal xc effects , these semilocal functionals ( first three rungs ) can lead to significant errors , characterized by self - interaction error ( sie ) , noncovalent interaction error ( ncie ) , and static correlation error ( sce ) , in situations where these failures occur @xcite .",
    "the sies of density functional approximations ( dfas ) can be reduced by hybrid dft methods ( fourth rung ) @xcite , combining a fraction of the exact hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange with a semilocal functional . as the fraction of hf exchange included in a hybrid functional",
    "can be rationalized by perturbation theory arguments @xcite , the pbe - based hybrid functional pbe0 @xcite , has gradually gained its popularity . in view of the successive evolution of the pbe - based functionals : lda ( first rung ) @xmath1 pbe ( second rung )",
    "@xmath1 tpss ( third rung ) @xmath1 pbe0 ( fourth rung ) @xmath1 @xmath2 ( fifth rung ) , naturally , the question is , what could be a functional on the fifth rung ( highest rung ) of the ladder ? in this work , we propose a pbe - based double - hybrid functional ( fifth rung ) , and demonstrate its superiority to the functionals on the first four rungs of the ladder , for a wide range of applications .",
    "the sies and ncies associated with dfas can be simultaneously reduced by double - hybrid methods ( fifth rung ) @xcite , combining a fraction of hf exchange and a fraction of second - order mller - plesset ( mp2 ) correlation @xcite with a semilocal functional .",
    "accordingly , a pbe - based double - hybrid functional is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hf exchange , @xmath5 is the pbe exchange , @xmath6 is the pbe correlation , and @xmath7 is the mp2 correlation ( a perturbative term evaluated with the orbitals obtained using the first three terms of the energy ) . in this work ,",
    "the two mixing parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are determined by physical arguments ( i.e. , without the use of any empirical fitting to experimental or high - level _ ab initio _ data ) .",

    "( [ dh ] ) , only one of the mixing parameters needs to be determined .",
    "functionals on the first four rungs of the ladder fail to describe long - range van der waals ( vdw ) interactions in regions where there is no overlap of the subsystems , due to the lack of long - range correlation effects @xcite .",
    "this problem can be greatly reduced by the dft - d ( ks - dft with empirical dispersion corrections ) schemes @xcite or by a fully nonlocal density functional for vdw interactions ( vdw - df ) @xcite , showing generally acceptable performance on several noncovalent systems @xcite .    by contrast , the mp2 correlation in a double - hybrid functional is itself fully nonlocal , and thus responsible for describing long - range vdw interactions . to determine the fraction @xmath11 of mp2 correlation in eq .",
    "( [ dh ] ) , consider the two limiting cases where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which reduce to pbe and mp2 , respectively . in view of the underbinding tendency of pbe and overbinding tendency of mp2 in describing the interaction energies of many vdw complexes ,",
    "a mixing of 50% of pbe correlation with 50% of mp2 correlation seems physically justified ( as vdw interactions are inherently _ correlation _ effects ) .",
    "employing this half - and - half mixing of the pbe and mp2 correlation functionals with the ls1dh approximation in eq .",
    "( [ ls1dh ] ) , we obtain @xmath15 our resulting pbe - based double - hybrid functional , defined in eqs .  ( [ dh ] ) and ( [ pbe0 - 2 ] ) , is denoted as pbe0 - 2 , where the  0 \" refers to no fitting parameters , and the  -2 \" refers to the post - ks treatment for the mp2 correlation .    by contrast , the mixing parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are adopted in pbe0-dh @xcite , another pbe - based double - hybrid functional ( also based on eqs .",
