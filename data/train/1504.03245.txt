    "recent experimental studies of nuclei in the nobelium region provided rich spectroscopic data  @xcite , which , in principle , can be used as a benchmark information for extrapolations into the region of superheavy nuclei .",
    "numerous theoretical studies are aimed at modelling of these spectroscopic data  @xcite so as to make such extrapolations as reliable as possible .",
    "the estimation of theoretical uncertainties is one of the most essential aspects of extrapolating nuclear models into exotic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "one , fairly easy part of it , is the evaluation of statistical uncertainties of observables that are related to the uncertainties of model parameters adjusted , in one way or another , to experimental data .",
    "another one , very difficult , pertains to those systematic uncertainties related to the definition and contents of the different terms that make up the models themselves .",
    "an obvious strategy , which , anyhow , gives us only a limited glimpse on possible systematic uncertainties , is to study a set of variants of a given model , and to analyze differences obtained for calculated observables .    in the present study",
    ", we aim at such an analysis of results obtained within three fairly different energy - density - functional ( edf ) approaches .",
    "namely , we employ the covariant edfs  @xcite , with one classic ( nl1  @xcite ) and one recent ( nl3 *  @xcite ) parameter set , skyrme edfs  @xcite , with one classic ( sly4  @xcite ) and one recent ( unedf2  @xcite ) parameter set , as well as gogny edfs @xcite , again with one classic ( d1s  @xcite ) and one recent ( d1 m  @xcite ) parameter set .",
    "our goal is thus to determine , present , and compare results obtained within these six models for a common set of calculated observables .",
    "we aim at performing these analyses within the most similar and/or equivalent conditions , so as to meaningfully discuss general _ qualitative _ similarities and differences . in all cases ,",
    "pairing correlations are treated on the bogoliubov level . in the literature , it is customary to label such calculations as hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) in the non - relativistic cases and as relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) for the specific variant of relativistic mean - field model used here , thereby emphasizing that hfb - like equations are solved instead of simpler hf+bcs equations . only in the calculations with a gogny force",
    ", however , the same effective interaction is used to determine direct , exchange , and pairing matrix elements . by contrast , in case of skyrme edf and the relativistic approach particle - hole and pairing matrix elements relate to different effective interactions , which can be used to simplify their form and phenomenological adjustment .",
    "also , in the rhb approach all exchange terms are neglected , whereas in the case of many skyrme parameterizations some are modified in order to improve the description of data @xcite .",
    "none of these formal differences is relevant for our discussion , and we will use whenever possible the generic notion of an edf method for all three approaches .",
    "indeed , in all cases the total energy can be cast into the form of a functional of normal and anomalous one - body density matrices from which the equations - of - motion are then derived by variation .",
    "we do not attribute too much of an importance to _ quantitative _ similarities and differences between the obtained results , especially when the models are compared to experimental data .",
    "indeed , a detailed agreement with the data may crucially depend on specific model - parameter adjustments , or on various corrections taken into account or disregarded .",
    "the _ phenomenological _",
    "edf used include a limited set of parameters ( typically between seven and twenty ) and aim at a global description of a wide variety of nuclear properties and therefore a perfect agreement with experimental data is out of reach at present .",
    "certainly , in the future all edf approaches will be improved ; here we only look into generic properties obtained for selected current global parameterisations thereof .    in the present analysis",
    ", we systematically calculated the ground states of even - even and odd - mass nuclei from uranium ( @xmath2 ) to rutherfordium ( @xmath3 ) and for neutron numbers between @xmath4 and 156 .",
    "the selection of this region of heaviest actinides / lightest superheavy nuclei is guided by the need for reliable experimental data on spectroscopic properties ( in particular , on the single - particle energies of deformed one - quasiparticle states ) based on which the extrapolability of a given theory / functional towards region of superheavy nuclei may be judged .",
    "in addition , we determined low - lying quasiparticle spectra of odd - mass nuclei and low - spin moments of inertia of even - even nuclei .",
    "the main thrust of the analysis was on the attempt to identify single - particle and shell - structure properties of these nuclei by looking at many - body observables such as masses , odd - even and two - particle mass staggering , and excitation energies .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "selected theoretical aspects of our calculations are presented in section  [ sec2 ] , with four subsections discussing the methods related to obtaining results for the skyrme edf sly4 ( [ sec2b ] ) , skyrme edf unedf2 ( [ sec2d ] ) , gogny edfs ( [ sec2c ] ) , and covariant edfs ( [ sec2a ] ) . the results of the calculations are given in section  [ sec3 ] , with subsections devoted to the nilsson diagrams ( [ sec3b ] ) , quasiparticle spectra ( [ sec3a ] and [ sec3c ] ) , odd - even and two - particle mass staggering ( [ sec3d ] ) , and moments of inertia ( [ sec3e ] ) .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "for the skyrme edf sly4 @xcite , the calculations were carried out with the skyrme hfb solver cr8 whose development over the years has been documented in refs .",
    "it uses a 3d coordinate space mesh representation of single - particle states along the lines of the solver ev8 described in ref .",
    "@xcite , but is extended in such a way that intrinsic time - reversal invariance can be broken and that hfb equations are solved instead of hf+bcs .",
    "single - particle states are represented in a cubic box of @xmath5@xmath6 with a step size of 0.8fm between discretization points .",
    "imposing triaxial symmetry , only 1/8 of the box has to be represented numerically , meaning that only a @xmath7 mesh is to be treated .",
    "when calculated with sly4 , the ground states of even - even nuclei considered here are all axial , and the blocked states of odd-@xmath8 nuclei also remain almost axial .",
    "all blocked calculations were initialized with the ground states of adjacent even - even nuclei .",
    "self - consistent blocking was performed by considering the quasiparticle state dominated by a given eigenstate of the single - particle hamiltonian and by exchanging the corresponding columns of the hfb @xmath9 and @xmath10 matrices after the diagonalization of the hfb hamiltonian , which in turn was constructed using the mean fields of the blocked solution from the previous iteration , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite .    to avoid mixing of quasiparticle states with different average values of the angular momentum component @xmath11 parallel to the symmetry axis of the initial configuration in the diagonalization of the hfb hamiltonian",
    ", the many - body expectation value of @xmath12 was held fixed with a cranking constraint at the value of @xmath12 equal to the one of the blocked quasiparticle state . as the code cr8 allows for triaxial shapes",
    "the mixing can not be fully suppressed . as a consequence ,",
    "the blocked hfb states are not necessarily orthogonal even when they have different average value of @xmath12 .    in this respect , blocking the @xmath13 levels presents a particular difficulty . without a cranking constraint , the code cr8 very often converges toward a solution where the many - body expectation value @xmath12 is close to zero , and where the blocked quasiparticle in the spectrum of eigenstates of the hfb hamiltonian is mixed with other low - lying quasiparticles of different @xmath11 . for these states , using or not using the cranking constraint might in some cases make a difference of the order of 100 to 200kev .",
    "an example is the ground state of @xmath14cf . in blocked calculations with cranking constraint",
    ", there is a low lying @xmath15 level at 45kev excitation energy above the calculated @xmath16 ground state . in the calculations without cranking constraint ,",
    "the energy of the @xmath17 state does not change much , but the @xmath18 level is lowered by about 180kev and becomes the ground state , in agreement with experiment , but at the expense of the blocked quasiparticle being a strong mixture of @xmath13 and @xmath19 , and of having an angular momentum @xmath12 that can not be easily interpreted within the strong coupling model anymore . for blocked states with higher @xmath11 ,",
    "the mixing is always much smaller .    for the coupling constants of the so - called time - odd terms that contribute to cranked and blocked states , the same `` hybrid '' choice was made as in many earlier calculations @xcite .",
    "they were set to the `` native '' values dictated by a density - dependent skyrme two - body force for all terms except for those that multiply terms that couple two derivatives and two pauli spin matrices .",
    "the latter were set to zero for reasons of galilean invariance and internal consistency , cf",
    ".  refs .",
    "@xcite for further discussion .    in the present study",
    ", neutron and proton surface pairing interactions were used , with the strengths adjusted to the three - point gaps @xmath20 of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , as defined by eqns .",
    "( [ d3n ] ) and  ( [ d3p ] ) below , leading to @xmath26 the pairing - active spaces were limited by the soft cutoffs of 5mev above and below the neutron and proton fermi energies as described in ref",
    ".  @xcite . with that , the proton pairing strength is significantly larger than that given by the standard value of @xmath27mev@xmath28 used for heavy nuclei in previous publications @xcite ( which all have been carried out using the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) scheme , though ) .",
    "these previous values were obtained by adjusting moments of inertia in rotational bands of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "there is , however , also some published work on very heavy nuclei @xcite where the pairing interaction of volume type was adjusted to some @xmath29 values of odd-@xmath8 actinide nuclei .    in principle",
    ", the like - particle pairing interaction should be of isovector type , which implies @xmath30 .",
    "differences between the adjusted neutron and proton pairing strengths can have many reasons : ( i ) the compensation of imperfections of the calculated single - particle spectra , ( ii ) the compensations of the cutoff energy that is chosen to be the same in neutron and proton phase spaces ( iii ) the compensation of the imperfections of the chosen form of the pairing interaction itself . note that if there were none of the above mentioned deficiencies , the proton pairing strength would have to be _ smaller _ than the neutron pairing strength , so as to compensate for the absence of coulomb pairing in our calculations .",
    "our attempts to adjust the neutron pairing strength to @xmath20 in @xmath14 ( @xmath31 ) , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present work for unedf2 , led to the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33mev@xmath28 . with such much weaker neutron pairing strength , in ground states of",
    "many of the lighter odd-@xmath34 nuclei , the pairing disappeared .",
    "this seems to be connected to an anomaly of the calculated single - particle spectra of heavy @xmath31 isotones that translates into a much larger values of @xmath20 for these nuclei than for the neighbouring ones .      for the skyrme edf unedf2",
    "@xcite , the calculations were performed using the symmetry - unrestricted code hfodd ( v268h )  @xcite .",
    "the hfb equations were solved by expanding single - particle wave functions on 680 deformed harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) basis states , with ho frequencies of @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev .",
    "this corresponds to including the ho basis states up to @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the time - odd coupling constants of the skyrme edf unedf2 were determined by the local - gauge - invariance arguments , as defined in ref .",
    "the hfb equation adopted a quasiparticle cutoff energy of 60mev . within this model space",
    ", the neutron and proton pairing strengths were readjusted to match the experimental values of @xmath20 and @xmath23 in @xmath14cf and @xmath24bk , respectively .",
    "this resulted in values of @xmath39 that are larger by about 25 and 50mev @xmath28 , respectively , than those corresponding to the original unedf2 values , where the ln pairing corrections were included , though .",
    "odd mass nuclei were described using the hfb method with full blocking and taking into account all possible time - odd fields coming from the potential part of the gogny interaction .",
    "the original formulation of the density - dependent part of the interaction is preserved and therefore no additional time - odd density - dependent terms are added to it .",
    "this assumption has to be verified in the future as there are indications that such kind of terms could be required to recover basic properties of odd - odd systems @xcite .",
    "the computer code atb was used in the calculations @xcite .",
    "axial symmetry was preserved in the calculations but reflection symmetry was not .",
    "therefore , the projection of the angular momentum along the intrinsic axial - symmetry axis , @xmath40 , is a good quantum number , but this is not necessarily the case for parity .",
    "however , many of the states analyzed show a mean value of the parity operator , which is rather close to either plus or minus one , allowing the labelling of those states with a definite parity .",
    "as @xmath41 is a good quantum number , states with different values of @xmath41 are automatically orthogonal .",
    "states with the same @xmath41 value , same parity and similar deformation parameters are imposed to be orthogonal to each other by using the traditional technique of constraints . the way the constraints are handled",
    "does not depend on the nature of the constrained operator as only its mean value and gradient are required @xcite .",
    "the code expands the quasiparticle operators in a harmonic oscillator basis with 15 shells ( @xmath42 states ) although axial symmetry reduces the maximum size of matrices to @xmath43 , corresponding to the @xmath44 block .    in the odd - mass ( odd number parity )",
    "case , the hfb iterative minimization process requires a starting mean - field state with given characteristics .",
    "an hfb mean - field state with even number parity ( obtained with a time - even code ) was used to generate this starting configuration .",
    "the mean values of neutron @xmath34 and proton @xmath45 number operators were constrained to the required values for the odd nucleus under consideration . to avoid",
    "spurious good - parity solutions , which could result from the propagation of self - consistent symmetries in the hfb method , a small octupole moment was also constrained .",
    "ten quasiparticle states with the lowest one - quasiparticle energies coming out of this calculation were considered as starting configurations for the time - odd code atb .",
    "they were obtained with the standard  blocking procedure \" consisting of swapping the appropriate columns in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 matrices of the bogoliubov transformation .",
    "each of the starting configurations was labelled with the corresponding @xmath41 quantum number , which was preserved all along the minimization process .",
    "the first starting configuration with a given value of @xmath41 usually converges to the lowest - energy band head with angular momentum @xmath46 . for the same value of @xmath41",
    ", the second starting configuration usually converges to the same first solution , unless an orthogonality constraint to that state is imposed ( including both the @xmath41 and @xmath47 states ) . for the third starting configuration for a given @xmath41 value , the orthogonality constraints with respect to the first and second states are required . in principle , for the @xmath48-th starting configuration @xmath49 orthogonality constraints to the states previously obtained are required .",
    "although the number of constraints can be relatively high , this is not a formal problem for the gradient method used in the code , as handling of constraints is very simple to implement @xcite .",
    "the orthogonality constraint is also important to ensure the orthogonality of the physical states .",
    "if such orthogonality is not imposed , even if the states are different , the relative excitation energies can be shifted . in the present calculations",
    "only two starting configurations for each value of @xmath41 were considered .    for the calculation of the properties of even - even nuclei required in the evaluation of the pairing gap parameters , the code hfbaxial was used .",
    "it has the capability to break reflection symmetry although the phenomenon was not relevant in the present calculation .",
    "moments of inertia were determined using cranked hfb wave functions obtained with the code hfbtri . in this code , the axial and time - reversal symmetries were allowed to be broken in the minimization process .",
    "the rhb equations @xcite were solved in the basis of an anisotropic three - dimensional harmonic oscillator in cartesian coordinates .",
    "for all nuclei and states determined in this work , the same basis deformation of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and oscillator frequency of @xmath52a@xmath53mev have been used .",
    "all fermionic and bosonic states belonging to the shells up to @xmath54 and @xmath55 were taken into account when performing diagonalization of the dirac equation and matrix inversion of the klein - gordon equations , respectively . as follows from detailed analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , this truncation of basis provides sufficient accuracy of the calculations .    as the effective interaction in the particle - particle ( @xmath56 ) channel , the central part of the non - relativistic gogny finite - range interaction was used .",
    "the clear advantage of such a pairing force is that it provides an automatic cutoff of high - momentum components .",
    "the motivation for such an approach to the description of pairing was given in ref .",
    "the d1s parametrization of the gogny force was used here .",
    "no specific adjustment of its strength was used , because it provided a reasonable description of the pairing indicators in @xmath24bk and @xmath57cf and moments of inertia in @xmath58no @xcite .",
    "two different covariant edfs , namely , nl1",
    "@xcite  fitted to the nuclei in the valley of beta - stability , and nl3 * @xcite  tailored towards the description of neutron - rich nuclei , were used in the current study .",
    "the covariant edf nl1 was extensively used in the calculations of rotational bands across the nuclear chart ( see ref .",
    "covariant edf nl3 * was less tested than nl1 with respect to the description of rotating nuclei .",
    "however , its global performance is well established @xcite .",
    "note that so far only these two covariant edfs were systematically confronted with experimental data on single - particle states .",
    "for example , the study of predominantly single - particle states in odd - mass nuclei neighbouring to the doubly magic spherical nuclei was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite within the relativistic particle - vibration coupling model employing covariant edf nl3*. in ref .",
    "@xcite , the first systematic study of the single - particle spectra in deformed nuclei in rare - earth region and actinides was performed with the covariant edfs nl1 and nl3*.    it is interesting that the overall accuracy of the description of the energies of deformed one - quasiparticle states @xcite is slightly better in the old covariant edf nl1 than in the recent functional nl3*. this suggests that the inclusion of extra information on neutron rich nuclei into the fit of the functional nl3 * may lead to some degradation of the description of single - particle states along the valley of beta - stability .",
    "note that these two functionals well reproduce deformation properties of ground states of even - even actinides @xcite and indicate that they are axially symmetric .",
    "a proper description of odd or rotating nuclei implies breaking of the time - reversal symmetry of the mean field , which is induced by the unpaired nucleon @xcite or rotation @xcite . as a consequence , time - odd mean fields and nucleonic currents , which cause the _ nuclear magnetism _",
    "@xcite have to be taken into account . in the covariant edf",
    ", time - odd mean fields are defined through the lorentz invariance , and thus they do not require additional coupling constants .",
    "the effects of blocking due to the odd particle were included in a fully self - consistent way .",
    "this was done within the code crhb , according to refs .",
    "the blocked orbital was specified by different tags such as ( i ) dominant main oscillator quantum number @xmath34 of the wave function , ( ii ) dominant @xmath41 quantum number of the wave function , ( iii ) particle or hole nature of the blocked orbital , and ( iv ) position of the state within the specific parity / signature / dominant-@xmath34/dominant-@xmath41 . for a given odd - mass nucleus",
    ", possible blocked configurations were defined from the analysis of calculated quasiparticle spectra in neighboring even - even nuclei and the occupation probabilities of the single - particle orbitals of interest in these nuclei .",
    "note that in the cases when the calculations of odd - mass nuclei were performed only for the definition of the @xmath59 indicators ( see sec .",
    "[ sec3d ] below ) , we restricted the analysis to 56 one - quasiparticle configurations with expected lowest total energies , so as to properly determine the ground state of an odd - mass nucleus .",
    "the calculations confirmed the conclusion of the statistical analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite that absolute majority of the one - quasiparticle configurations are axially symmetric . however , some degree of triaxiality was obtained in the @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] configurations .",
    "in this section , we present the results obtained and we look for signatures of shell effects in the systematics of many - body observables .",
    "this is in addition to analyzing the eigenvalues of mean - field hamiltonians as a function of deformation , that is , the nilsson diagrams , which are not observables , but provide a useful illustration of the underlying single - particle structure .    we note here that the calculation of many - body observables implies a full self - consistency reached for every individual state , that is , for ground and excited states .",
    "for example , quasiparticle spectra , which we discuss below , always result from calculating differences of total energies , determined separately for different many - body self - consistent solutions .",
    "because of that , each blocked hfb state may have a slightly different quadrupole , hexadecapole , or higher deformation ( see , for example , the results of statistical analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which then feeds back to the mean and pairing fields . in this way",
    ", the deformation - polarization effects , exerted by one - quasiparticle states , are fully taken into account .    in odd - mass nuclei ,",

    "[ j1n ] , for the covariant edf nl3 * ( d ) , values of @xmath142 show pronounced maxima at @xmath79 for isotopic chains of @xmath131104 . for nl1 ( a )",

    "neutron numbers of @xmath79 and 150 correspond nicely to the shell gaps shown in fig .",

    "it is necessary to recognize that for a proper reproduction of experimental moments of inertia , the inclusion of the ln method into the calculations appears to be more important in covariant @xcite than in non - relativistic edfs .",
    "the ln method renders the values of calculated moments of inertia much closer to the data @xcite and at the same time much less sensitive to the underlying shell structure , at variance with the data , cf .  the discussion in ref .",
    "in this work we have used three different edf approaches , each for two different parameter sets , so as to gain some insight into the degree of systematic uncertainties that are related to applying these approaches to spectroscopic properties of heavy nuclei at the gateway to superheavy region . on the one hand",
    ", we concluded that the overall coarse description of several spectroscopic properties of nuclei in this region is , in general , correct . on the other hand",
    ", we identified numerous smaller or larger differences between the results obtained within these different edfs .",
    "in particular , none of the studied global edf parameterisations precisely describes variations of the shell structure seen in experiment .",
    "this can be associated with small deficiencies of the obtained deformed shell properties .    on the scale of very precise spectroscopic experimental data ,",
    "differences between various edf approaches are large .",
    "they are of the same order as the degree of differences with experiment .",
    "this points to still fairly large systematic uncertainties inherent to the models currently in use .",
    "moreover , none of the studied models could at present be identified as the one that systematically performs significantly better than another one . however , it is interesting that on the average the accuracy of the description of the excitation energies of deformed one - quasiparticle states in the nobelium region is substantially better than the accuracy of the description of the energies of dominant single - particle states at spherical shape in odd - mass nuclei neighbouring to doubly magic @xmath100pb ( even as compared with the calculations which include particle - vibration coupling @xcite .",
    "the obtained results suggest that further work on improving the performance of the edf methods is very much required .",
    "first , one can hope that within the existing forms of edfs , one can still find better global parametrizations . for skyrme edfs ,",
    "this route has already been explored and a negative conclusion was reached  @xcite , but for covariant and gogny edfs similar work has not yet been performed .",
    "second , one can hope that various beyond - mean - field corrections , not included in the present analysis , may have strong impact on the results , and thus modify the current conclusions .",
    "at least that happens in the covariant framework , where accounting for the ( quasi)particle - vibration coupling improves substantially the accuracy of the description of predominantly single - particle states in spherical medium and heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is still a possibility of building new functionals , with beyond - mean - field effects incorporated from the very beginning .",
    "again , for the skyrme edfs , employed together with odd - particle polarization effects included , a negative conclusion has recently been reached  @xcite .",
    "however , so far in the covariant and gogny edf approaches no such studies have been performed , and such route has to be explored .",
    "third , one can also attempt building new classes of edfs , where systematic expansions within different schemes are used . only very recently",
    "this route was started to be explored in non - relativistic edfs , see , refs .",
