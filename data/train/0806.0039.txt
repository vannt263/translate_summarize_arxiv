    "we see that transverse patterns are formed , giving rise to mesoscopic quantum structures , where the transverse density distribution exhibits first two peaks , and then , by further opening the trap , multiple peaks . differing from ionic coulomb crystals , here quantum fluctuations smoothen the transition from the single- to the double - peaked distribution .",

    "[ sec:4 ] the conclusions are drawn .",

    "we stress that this approach gives only a qualitative description , as long - range order can not exist in one - dimension at finite temperatures in a dipolar gas , nor at @xmath36 in a quantum dipolar gas .",

    "it is interesting to notice that the second value , at which one observes another discontinuity of the classical radial spreading , is a transition to multiple chains and it is expected to be of first order  @xcite .",

    "figure  [ figrd ] displays the radial density profile at fixed @xmath69 for various values of @xmath68 , which are distributed across the value @xmath70 at which the classical phase transition linear  zigzag occurs for the chosen value of @xmath69 . for @xmath42",

    "a system with short range interactions is well described by the gross  pitaevskii equation .",
    "it is natural to think that in this regime , where the description of a pure condensate applies , the system is superfluid .    a possible way out , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is based on the calculation of the energy dissipation caused by dragging a small probe through the system .",
    "the conclusion is that there is always some dissipation , which ranges from negligibly small ( in gross ",
    "pitaevskii limit ) to the same as in a normal system ( in tonks ",
    "girardeau limit ) .",
    "there is a continuous crossover from ( quasi)-superfluid to normal system . in our case , the limit of small density @xmath92 corresponds to tonks ",

    "the dipolar system corresponds to a luttinger liquid with even stronger interactions than in the tonks ",
    "girardeau regime . as a result",

    "to conclude , we have studied the ground state of a dipolar gas of bosons at @xmath36 in low dimensions starting from quasi one - dimensional geometry and opening the radial trap , so that a two - dimensional structure develops .",
    "we do an analytical study of the system in the classical limit close to the transition to the zigzag configuration by applying landau theory and compare these predictions with numerical simulations using classical monte carlo methods .",
    "we determine the phase diagram numerically using quantum monte carlo methods , and study in detail the effect of quantum fluctuations on the linear- zigzag transition .",
    "the transition from a one - dimensional to a planar configuration occurs with the creation of a mesoscopic structure in the transverse direction , which exhibits the main features of the transition from a single to a double and then a multiple chain distribution of dipoles , while quasi - order is observed also in the transverse pair correlation function at large densities .",
