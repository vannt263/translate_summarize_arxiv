    "one of the main and still unresolved problems in nuclear physics is the understanding of the properties and phase structure of hot and dense matter . here",
    "heavy - ion physics is an important experimental approach to extract information on very hot and , depending on the beam energy , also dense matter . as a complementary approach",
    "the investigation of neutron stars can yield constraints on the properties of extremely dense and rather cold matter , where the temperature t is usually less than 1 mev except for the short period of the proto - neutron star , where t might reach 30 to 50 mev .",
    "therefore both fields together can help to pin down , or at least constrain the equation of state and other properties of strongly interacting matter far beyond the nuclear matter groundstate .",
    "one important aspect of qcd is its inherent chiral symmetry that characterizes the transition from low - density / temperature matter to matter at high values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 crossing from the symmetry broken to the restored phase .",
    "there are different ways to construct a chirally symmetric hadronic model .",
    "one approach , given by the linear @xmath2 model and its many variations and extensions . here",
    "the masses of the baryons are largely generated by the coupling of baryons to the scalar field .",
    "therefore , in the chirally restored phase the baryons become very light . alternatively , in the so - called parity - doublet approach the baryonic degrees of freedom are augmented by the opposite - parity counterparts .",
    "@xcite one possible state of such a particle is the n(1535 ) as parity partmer of the nucleon . in this formulation",
    "it is possible to define a mass term for the baryons without violating chiral symmetry .",
    "the chirally restored phase is characterized by the degeneracy of both parity partners .",
    "it has been shown that it is possible to describe saturating nuclear matter in such an approach.@xcite in the following we discuss results based on the latter approach , studying hadronic su(2 ) and su(3 ) models as well as an extended description including quark degrees of freedom .",
    "we present results for the phase structure of the models as well as the properties of compact stars .",
    "in the parity doublet model positive and negative parity states of the baryons are arranged in doublets @xcite .",
    "the two components of the fields defining the respective parity partners , @xmath3 and @xmath4 transform in opposite way regarding chiral transformations : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the rotations in the left- and right handed subspaces .",
    "this allows for a chirally invariant mass term in the lagrangian of the general form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents a mass parameter .",
    "the coupling terms of the scalar field to the nucleonic states read @xmath10 as both states in the doublet mix one has to diagonalize the states as shown in @xcite . fixing the coupling constants to reproduce the vacuum masses of the nucleons the resulting effective masses of the diagonalized states read @xcite : @xmath11\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma_0 ^ 2}+m_0 ^ 2}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\pm&\\frac{m_{n_+}-m_{n_-}}{2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_0}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denotes the vacuum value of the scalar field .",

    "resulting compressibilities @xmath16 of nuclear matter are shown in figure 1 as function of the mass parameter @xmath9.@xcite one can observe a strong dependence on this parameter . in order to have a reasonable value of @xmath16 below 300 mev a rather high value of @xmath9 around 840 mev has to be chosen .     as function of mass parameter @xmath9 given the mass of the nucleonic parity partmer @xmath17mev .",

    "the result of this calculation can be seen in figure 1 ( right panel ) .",
    "as the identification of the nucleonic parity partner is unclear one can study the model for different values of @xmath18 .",

    "2 ) a substantial fraction of the baryons inside the star are given by the parity partners that start to appear at about @xmath19 in the case of n@xmath20 and @xmath21 for p@xmath20.@xcite one can observe that for large baryon densities the respective densities of the nucleons and the parity partners become equal , which is a consequence of the degeneracy of the two states in the chirally restored phase .",
    "this restoration of chiral symmetry can be seen in the behavior of the scalar field as it is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 . here also the difference of the drop of the scalar field value in the case of isospin symmetric and star matter is shown .",
    "as it is generally the case the transition becomes weaker and shifts to lower densities for star matter .",
    "this is due to the breaking of the isospin symmetry in the stellar environment .",
    "thus , the parity partner of the neutron is populated earlier , but as this onset of population affects only the n@xmath20 compared to the simultaneous appearance of the n@xmath20 and p@xmath20 in the case of isospin symmetric matter the effect on the scalar field is reduced .",
    "extending the model to flavor su(3 ) in a nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry we follow the discussion in @xcite . in general",

    "@xmath27 has been fixed to a value of 150 mev .",
    "the index @xmath28 denotes the baryon and @xmath29 are the positive and negative parity partners as in the su(2 ) case .",
    "note that in the su(3 ) formulation there are two scalar fields @xmath2 and @xmath30 , which are effectively the counterparts to the qcd scalar non - strange and strange quark condensates .",
    "the scalar meson interaction driving the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry can be written in terms of su(3 ) invariants @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the multiplet of scalar mesons:@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is fixed by demanding a vanishing potential in the vacuum .",
    "the explicit symmetry breaking term that generates the correct pion and kaon masses with their corresponding decay constants can be written as @xcite @xmath35    fitting the coupling constants to a reasonable nuclear matter ground state as in the previous section we solve the equations of motion for the various fields . in a further extension we include quark degrees of freedom and the polyakov loop field @xmath36 as order parameter for the deconfinement transition @xcite . here",
    "we follow the formulation as outlined in ref .",
    "the quarks couple to the condensates and attain an effective mass : @xmath37 with couplings @xmath38 . @xmath39 and @xmath40 describe the current quark masses as well as contributions from the slowly varying gluon condensate @xcite .",
    "the potential of the polyakov loop effectively represents the contribution of the gluons to the thermodynamical quantities of the system like pressure and energy density .",
    "here we adopt the ansatz proposed in @xcite : @xmath41\\ ] ] with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 sets the scale for the first - order deconfinement phase transition in the quenched limit of only gluons .",
    "+ finally , we introduce an excluded volume correction for the hadrons @xcite , which leads to the suppression of hadronic degrees of freedom relative to quarks at higher densites as described in @xcite .    using the parameter set for a mass of the negative parity state of the nucleon @xmath17mev and assuming , for simplicity , the same mass splitting of all baryon doublets as the nucleonic one , as the possible attribution of observed states is less clear for the hyperons , @xcite we study the phase transition behavior of the model as function of chemical potential and temperature .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "the two plots are calculated for different values of the temperature parameter in the polyakov loop potential @xmath45 and @xmath46 mev , respectively .",
    "the lower band indicates the chiral transition region during which the value of @xmath2 drops from 0.8 to 0.2 of its vacuum value .",
    "the upper band corresponds to the deconfinement transition connected to the value @xmath36 of the polyakov loop changing from 0.2 to 0.8 .",
    "the two first - order transition lines for the liquid - gas and chiral transition are shown as solid lines .",
    "both stop at a critical end - point with values ( in units of mev ) of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .    in order to study the particle species that are populated the densities of the various degrees of freedom as function of chemical potential",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ popsu3 ] .",
    "the results in the left panel are obtained for zero temperature and isospin - symmetric matter .",
    "one can see the onset of the occurrence of quarks and the nucleonic parity partners at slightly higher chemical potential , such that there actually is a two - step first - order transition .",
    "in contrast to the hadronic model the parity partner appears earlier driven by the appearance of the quarks and the connected drop of the scalar condensate . a similar , but more involved behavior can be seen in the right panel for star matter",
    ". first the down quark appears in a first - order transition , then , in a second transition the positively charged up quark and the nucleonic parity partners are populated .",
    "the hyperonic states and their parity partners are suppressed by the occurrence of the quarks and appear only at much higher chemical potential .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=264].,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    using the thus obtained equation of state we solve the tov equations varying the central pressure of the star .",
    "the resulting star sequences are given in figure [ starsu3 ] .",
    "the result for the purely hadronic model with a maximum mass of about 1.6 solar masses and a radius of 12 km . including quarks shifts the maximum mass to 1.96 solar masses with a reduced radius of 10.7 km , which is in agreement with the rather accurate measurement of the @xmath49 solar mass pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "@xcite the kink in this sequence indicates the onset of a quark core in the star , i.e. the transition from a neutron to a hybrid star . the fact that the masses for both cases below that value are not identical originates from the fact that only in the case of the full calculation with quarks the excluded volume corrections are taken into account .        summarizing , we discussed su(2 ) and su(3 ) parity doublet models for hadronic matter with and without quark degrees of freedom .",
    "we could reproduce nuclear matter saturation properties reasonably well . depending on the mass of the parity partners",
    "the model has a first - order chiral phase transition at high densities for larger masses and a crossover for smaller masses , respectively .",
    "including quark degrees of freedom triggers a first - order transition for temperatures below @xmath50mev .",
    "the calculation of static hybrid stars yields maximum star masses of 2 solar masses in agreement with observation .",
