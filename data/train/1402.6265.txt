    "it is noteworthy that this invariance under the product of purely discrete symmetries is actually a consequence of the invariance of the lagrangian ( @xmath5 ) under a connected continuous group , namely , proper lorentz transformations .",
    "additionally , it follows from the requirement that @xmath5 be hermitian and the interactions in the underlying field theory be local , with the fields obeying the commutation relations dictated by the spin - statistics theorem .",
    "+ theories attempting to unify gravity and quantum mechanics may , however , break such seemingly solid pillars of low energy effective field theories ( like the standard model ( sm ) ) via new physics associated with the planck scale . for a general mechanism for the breaking of lorentz symmetry in string theories ,",
    "see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "other scenarios for such breaking have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite . also , as shown in @xcite , a violation of cpt always breaks lorentz invariance , while the converse is not true . a framework for incorporating cpt and lorentz violation into a general relativistically extended",
    "version of the sm has been formulated in @xcite .",
    "it is termed as the standard model extension ( sme ) , and our discussion in this paper will utilize the effective cpt violating ( cptv ) terms that it introduces .",
    "such terms , given the impressive agreement of the ( cpt and lorentz invariant ) sm with all present day experiments , must of necessity be small .",
    "a characteristic attribute of neutrino oscillations is the amplification , via interference , of the effects of certain small parameters ( @xmath6 neutrino masses ) in the underlying sm lagrangian . as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the cpt violation manifest in an effective sme hamiltonian",
    "can also be rendered measurable in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "its non - observation , on the other hand , can be used to set impressive limits on cpt and lorentz violation .",
    "this has been done , to cite a few recent examples , by icecube @xcite , double chooz @xcite , lsnd @xcite , miniboone @xcite , minos @xcite and super kamiokande @xcite .",
    "additionally , many authors have studied how best to parametrize and/or use neutrino oscillations and neutrino interactions to perform tests of cpt and lorentz symmetry breaking in different contexts , ranging from neutrino factories and telescopes to long baseline , atmospheric , solar and reactor experiments , including those looking for supernova neutrinos  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study the sensitivity of a large atmospheric magnetized iron calorimeter to cptv using a three flavour analysis with matter effects . as a reference detector for our study",
    ", we use the ical , the proposed detector for the india - based neutrino observatory(ino)@xcite .",
    "the main physics objective of ical is the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy through the observation of earth matter effects in atmospheric neutrinos , as discussed , for instance , in  @xcite .",
    "however , its lepton charge identification capability renders it useful in measurements related to our purpose here .    in what follows , in section 2",
    "we review the perturbative phenomenological approach that allows us to introduce the effects of cpt violation in the neutrino oscillation probability , based on the sme .",
    "we examine effects at the probability level , in order to get a better understanding of the physics that drives the bounds we obtain using our event rate calculations . in section 3",
    "we describe our method of analysis , and in section 4 we discuss our results , in the form the bounds on cpt violating terms .",
    "section 5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the effective lagrangian for a single fermion field , with lorentz violation@xcite induced by new physics at higher energies can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real numbers , hence @xmath8 and @xmath9 necessarily induce lorentz violation , being invariant under boosts and rotations , for instance .",
    "such violation under the group of proper lorentz transformations then leads to cpt violation @xcite .",
    "the effective contribution to the neutrino lagrangian can then be parametrized @xcite as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are four hermitian @xmath12 matrices corresponding to the four dirac indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 are flavor indices .",
    "therefore the effective hamiltonian in the vacuum for ultra - relativistic neutrinos with definite momentum p is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the neutrino mass matrix in the cpt conserving limit .",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath17 parameterize the extent of cpt violation .",
    "+ in many experimental situations , the neutrino passes through appreciable amounts of matter .",
    "accounting for this , the hamiltonian with cpt violation in the flavour basis can in principle be diagonal in different bases , one in which the neutrino mass matrix is diagonal , a second one in which the lorentz and cpt violating interactions are diagonal , and a third flavour basis .",
    "] becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 are unitary matrices and @xmath22 = @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the fermi coupling constant and @xmath25 is the electron number density .",
    "value of @xmath22 = 0.76 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath26 @xmath28 [ @xmath29 ev , where @xmath28 is the fraction of electron , which is @xmath30 0.5 for earth matter and @xmath31 is matter density inside earth .",

    "as is well - known , in standard neutrino oscillations , @xmath19 is parametrized by three mixing angles @xmath40 and one phase @xmath41 .",
    "independent rotation angles ( i.e. real numbers ) and @xmath42 imaginary quantities ( phases ) which define it . for dirac fields , @xmath43 of these may be absorbed into the representative spinor , while for majorana fields this can be done for n phases . in the latter case , the @xmath44 additional phases in @xmath19 become irrelevant when the product @xmath45 is taken . ] similarly ( see footnote ) , any parametrization of the matrix @xmath21 , needs three angles @xmath46 and six phases .",
    "thus @xmath47 contains six mixing angles @xmath48 and seven phases .",
    "+ it is clear that the results will depend on the mixing angles in the cpt violation sector . in what follows",
    ", we examine the effects of three different representative sets of mixing angles , 1 ) small mixing ( @xmath49 ) , 2 ) large mixing ( @xmath50 ) and the third set 3 ) uses the same values as the mixing in neutrino upmns , ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "we use the recent best fit neutrino oscillation parameters in our calculation as mentioned in table 1 .    before going into the detailed numerical calculations",
    ", we can roughly estimate the bound on cptv term .",
    "as an example , let us assume case 3 ) @xmath4 when @xmath52 , then @xmath53 can effectively be added to @xmath54 .",
    "if we take 10 gev for a typical neutrino energy , the value of @xmath54 will be about @xmath55 gev .",
    "assuming the cpt violating term to be of the same order , and assuming that neutrino mass splitting can be measured at ical to @xmath56 accuracy , we expect sensitivity to @xmath53 values of approximately around @xmath57 gev .    from case 3 above , we note further that in its probability expressions , @xmath58 will always appear with the smaller ( by a factor of 30 ) mass squared difference @xmath59 .",
    "thus we expect its effects on oscillations will be subdominant in general , limiting the capability of atmospheric neutrinos to constrain it , and in our work we have not been able to put useful constraints on @xmath58 . thus , our effort has been to find a method which will give the most stringent bounds on cpt violation as parametrized by @xmath0 . for simplicity ,",
    "all phases are set to zero , hence the distinction between dirac and majorana neutrinos with regard to the number of non - trival phases does not play a role in what follows .",
    "moreover , in the approximation where the effects of @xmath58 are much smaller than those of @xmath0 , the impact of at least some of the nontrivial phases anyway will be negligible .",
    "we also study the effect and impact of hierarchy in putting constraints on cptv violating terms .",
    "+ we also note here previously obtained limits on the parameters of @xmath60 .",
    "the solar and kamland data @xcite gives the bound @xmath61 @xmath62 1.6 @xmath26 @xmath63 gev . in @xcite by studying the ratio of total atmospheric muon neutrino survival rates,(@xmath4 two flavour approach different from the one in the present paper ) , it was shown that , for a 50 kt magnetized iron calorimeter , @xmath61 @xmath62 3 @xmath26 @xmath57 gev should be attainable with a @xmath64 kt - yr exposure . using a two - flavor analysis ,",
    "it was noted in @xcite that a long baseline ( l = 735 km ) experiment with a high energy neutrino factory can constrain @xmath61 to @xmath62 @xmath57 gev . a formalism for a three flavour analysis",
    "was presented in @xcite and bounds of the order of @xmath61 @xmath62 3 @xmath26 @xmath57 gev were calculated for the upcoming nova experiment and for neutrino factories .",
    "it has also been shown in @xcite , that a bound of @xmath65 @xmath62 6 @xmath26 @xmath66 gev at 99@xmath67 cl can be obtained with a 1 mt - yr magnetized iron detector .",
    "global two - flavor analysis of the full atmospheric data and long baseline k2k data puts the bound @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath57 gev @xcite . , since in principle this quantity can be either positive or negative in the same way the @xmath68 can be positive or negative . in our plots , where necessary , we assume it to be positive for simplicity . ]",
    "+    prior to discussing the results of our numerical simulations , it is useful to examine these effects at the level of probabilities .",
    "we note that the matter target in our case is cp asymmetric , which will automatically lead to effects similar to those induced by @xmath69 . in order to separate effects",
    "arises due to dynamical cpt violation from those originating due to the cp asymmtry of the earth , it helps to consider the difference in the disappearance probabilities with @xmath69 effects turned on and off , respectively .",
    "we use the difference in probabilities    @xmath70    we do this separately for @xmath71 and @xmath72 events with nh and ih assumed as the true hierarchy .",
    "the results are shown in the figures @xmath73 .",
    "( we note that at the event level , the total muon events receive contributions from both the @xmath74 disappearace and @xmath75 appearance channels , and the same is true for anti - neutrinos . in our final numerical results ,",
    "we have taken both these contributions into account ) .",
    "several general features are apparent in figures 1 - 2 .",
    "first , effects are uniformly small at shorter baselines irrespective of the value of the energy . from the 2 flavour analysis ,",
    "@xmath6 @xcite we recall that the survival probability difference in vaccuum is proportional to @xmath76 . the qualitative feature that cpt effects are larger at long baselines continues to be manifest even when one incorporates three flavour mixing and the presence of matter , and this is brought out in all the figures .",
    "secondly , as is well - known , matter effects are large and resonant for neutrinos and nh , and for anti - neutrinos with ih . thus in both these cases",
    ", they mask the ( smaller ) effect of cpt stemming from @xmath21 .",
    "hence for neutrino events , cpt sensitivity is significantly higher if the hierarchy is inverted as opposed to normal , and the converse is true for anti - neutrino events .",
    "finally , effects are largest for cases 3 ) and 2 ) , and smaller for case 1 ) .",
    "the effect is smaller for case 1 ) is due to the fact that mixing is very small compared to other two .",
    "the origin of the difference for the case 2 ) and 3 ) is likely due to the fact that cpt violating effects are smaller when @xmath77 is large , as shown in fig [ diffthb13_plot ] .",
    "+    we carry through this mode of looking at the difference between the case when @xmath69 is non - zero and zero repectively to the event and @xmath78 levels in our calculations below .",
    "to use the lepton charge identification capability of a magnetized iron calorimeter optimally , we calculate @xmath78 from @xmath79 and @xmath80 events separately . following this procedure , the contribution arising through matter being cpt asymmetric",
    "will expectedly cancel for any given zenith angle and energy . the numerical procedure adopted and the details of our calculation",
    "are provided in the following section .",
    "our work uses the ical detector as a reference configuration , but the qualitative content of the results will hold for any similar detector .",
    "magnetized iron calorimeters typically have very good energy and direction resolution for reconstructing @xmath81 and @xmath82 events .",
    "the analysis proceeds in two steps : ( 1 ) event simulation ( 2 ) statistical procedure and the @xmath83 analysis .",
    "we use the nuance@xcite neutrino generator to generate events .",
    "the ical detector composition and geometry are incorporated within nuance and atmospheric neutrino fluxes ( honda et al .",
    "@xcite ) have been used . in order to reduce the monte carlo ( mc ) fluctuations in the number of events given by nuance",
    ", we generate a very large number of neutrino events with an exposure of 50 kt @xmath26 1000 years and then finally normalize to 500 kt - yr .",
    "+ each changed - current neutrino event is characterized by neutrino energy and neutrino zenith angle , as well as by a muon energy and muon zenith angle . in order to save on computational time",
    ", we use a re - weighting algorithm to generate oscillated events .",
    "this algorithm , takes the neutrino energy and angle for each event and calculates probabilities @xmath84 and @xmath85 for any given set of oscillation parameters .",
