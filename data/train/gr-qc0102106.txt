    "during the first half of the xxth century , while trying to understand the group of transformations of differential equations , cartan laid down the foundations of modern differential geometry and established a link between analysis and geometry .",
    "one particular example that will be discussed in this work shows cartan s approach to the classification of solutions of odes @xcite .",
    "consider the 2-dim space @xmath0 with local coordinates @xmath1 and the following third order ode    @xmath2    with `` prime '' denoting the derivative with respect to the independent variable . if one performs a coordinate transformation on @xmath0 one gets another ode that is trivially related to the above equation .",
    "cartan thus considered the issue of how to classify solutions of third order odes into equivalence classes , with two solutions belonging to the same class if the corresponding odes were related by a coordinate transformation on @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that one can spend many hours before finding the appropriate coordinate transformation that will turn one ode into the other .",
    "cartan showed that with the general solution of a given third order ode , like the above , one can explicitly construct a connection one form on a 4-dim space @xmath3 with local coordinates @xmath4 ( the details are presented in the next section ) .",
    "furthermore , cartan showed that two third order odes are equivalent if their corresponding solutions yield the same geometric structure on @xmath3 .",
    "cartan also showed that when @xmath5 satisfies a given pde on @xmath3 , symbolically written as @xmath6=0 $ ] , then the connection is torsion free and a unique conformal structure can be given on the solution space ( 3-dim parameter space ) of the starting ode .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same equation @xmath6=0 $ ] arises in the three dimensional version of the so called null surface formulation ( nsf ) of general relativity ( gr ) @xcite . as we will see below ,",
    "this is not mere coincidence since we will show that the 3-dim version of nsf is almost contained in one of cartan s works @xcite .",
    "finding the correspondence between these two constructions was one of the motivations for writing this work .    in the nsf",
    "the main variable is a function @xmath7 , with @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 , subject to a third - order ordinary differential equation of the form @xmath11 where the function @xmath12 is restricted to satisfy the `` metricity condition '' @xmath13=0 $ ] .",
    "the general solution of ( [ ec1 ] ) is given by @xmath14 , with the constants of integration @xmath15 taken as coordinates of the 3d solution manifold @xmath16 .",
    "from this solution a space - time metric for @xmath16 can be constructed such that the level surfaces of @xmath17 are null foliations of @xmath16 for each fixed value of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the covector @xmath18 spans , for fixed values of @xmath15 , the circle of null directions and thus the parameter @xmath8 @xmath19 .",
    "except for the relabelling of functions and the topology of the starting space @xmath0 , both formulations share many geometric features , with cartan emphasizing the role of the connection one - form and the nsf the explicit construction of a metric on the solution space of ( [ ec1 ] ) .",
    "but a key point arises by noting that , by assumption , both formulations are local constructions in the 2-dim manifold .",
    "it follows from this fact that the solutions to ( [ one ] ) are families of smooth curves and ( as we will see below ) that the level sets @xmath20 are smooth null surfaces of the induced metric in the 3-dim solution space .",
    "however , we know that characteristic surfaces develop caustics and singularities as a result of the ` focusing ' properties of null geodesic congruences established in gr singularity theorems @xcite . moreover , the solutions to ( [ one ] ) that yield these null surfaces with caustics can not be smooth curves on @xmath0 , so they must develop self - intersections and singular points .",
    "a second motivation for this work is thus to consider the non - diffeomorphic generalization of these geometric constructions in order to account for the folds and non - differentiable edges of curves on @xmath0 that yield null congruences with caustics .",
    "the first step is to introduce the curves on @xmath0 according to arnold s theory of lagrangian manifolds as @xcite : @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is called the generating function ) .",
    "although @xmath23 may be smooth , the curve @xmath24 , @xmath25 might have self - intersections and singular points if @xmath26 is not injective .",
    "the question is how to find the proper @xmath23 such that ( [ lagr1]-[lagr2 ] ) define a null surface by setting @xmath27 and @xmath8 constant . as we will show in this work , curves with singular points in @xmath0 will induce null surfaces with caustics in @xmath16 .",
    "conversely , we will also show that if the null surfaces have conjugate points then the corresponding families of curves on @xmath0 have singularities .    in this reformulation ,",
    "( [ ec1 ] ) for @xmath17 is changed to an equation for @xmath23 , of the same type , @xmath28 and the metricity condition @xmath13=0 $ ] , which becomes singular at a caustic point , yields an entirely well - behaved equation @xmath29=0 $ ] whose solutions are the `` appropriate '' r.h.s . of ( [ ecg ] ) .",
    "as we will see in an example , among the solutions of ( [ ecg ] ) we obtain generating functions of caustics as listed in @xcite .",
    "this result encounters an immediate application inside the 2 + 1 nsf and also in the full theory because , to be in complete agreement with the standard gr formulation , it always remained as an open problem to write the metricity conditions of nsf in a form that explicitly shows the existence of the singular solutions @xcite .",
    "the work is organized as follows : in section ii we first give an account of cartan s geometric construction obtained in @xcite starting from the third - order equation ( [ ec1 ] ) .",
    "this review is presented in modern language since the original reference was written before modern differential geometry was invented and it is very difficult to follow .",
    "( it is worth mentioning that one `` variation '' on cartan s work has appeared in the literature @xcite but it is different from the original construction . )",
    "we then give a brief review of the nsf in 3-dim and show that this formalism is a particular case of cartan s construction .",
    "in section iii we proceed to generalize the local analysis of the previous section and write the regularized metricity condition @xmath30=0 $ ] .",
    "we also find a relation between curves with caustics on @xmath0 and null surfaces with conjugate points on @xmath16 .",
    "a simple example shows how to generate germs of caustics for the solutions to ( [ ecg ] ) .",
    "we conclude this work with some comments on the possibility of attaching a similar geometric structure to the original construction of the nsf in four dimensions .",
    "in this section we present two geometric constructions that arise from a third order ordinary differential equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 are coordinates on the cylinder @xmath33 . as we will see below",
    ", it turns that one of these constructions is almost contained as a particular case of the other .",
    "we first present cartan s approach @xcite , achieved by interpreting the integral curves @xmath34 as points @xmath35 of the three dimensional solution space @xmath16 , attaching to it a lorenztian metric @xmath36 and giving the structure of a one dimensional fiber bundle over @xmath16 , with @xmath37 as the coordinate of the fiber . on the base space we attach a `` null frame '' satisfying @xmath38 where @xmath39 . in terms of the dual basis @xmath40 of the null frame",
    ", the metric can be written as @xmath41 where we have chosen @xmath42 .",
    "we call the bundle constructed in this way as the bundle of null directions and we denote it by @xmath43 . note that for fixed values of @xmath8 , the three functions @xmath44 can be taken as coordinates on the base space of the bundle .",
    "thus , each point of the bundle is locally described by @xmath45    equation ( [ eq : thirdorder ] ) yields the pfaffian system @xcite on @xmath46 which , written in terms of these coordinates reads @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are functions to be determined .",
    "if we choose the @xmath51 to be the projections of ( [ pfaffian ] ) to the base space , then the solution of ( [ eq : thirdorder ] ) will give null surfaces @xmath52 by setting @xmath53 .    to characterize the geometric structure defined from ( [ eq : thirdorder ] ) , cartan introduces a connection and a covariant exterior derivative as    @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the covariant exterior derivative with respect to this connection ( see@xcite ) and @xmath56 are the connection one - forms .",
    "furthermore , cartan demands that the connection will be compatible with the metric in the sense that a null frame remains null under parallel transport , i.e.    @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a one - form on the bundle .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 it follows from the above that    @xmath60    thus , the connection is determined by four arbitrary one - forms , namely @xmath61    note that @xmath62 are linearly independent forms in @xmath46 .",
    "this assertion can be understood from the geometrical meaning that these forms have :    * @xmath63 is the differential system for null 2-surfaces , since on this surface @xmath55 @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath55 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 . *",
    "@xmath69 is the differential system for null geodesic , since on this curve @xmath55 @xmath64 @xmath70 .",
    "* @xmath71 is the differential system for a point of @xmath16 .",
    "+ note also that the vanishing of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is equivalent to impose @xmath74 const .",
    ", @xmath75 const .",
    "thus , @xmath73 can be chosen to be of the form @xmath76d@xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 being a priori arbitrary .",
    "the idea is to write the non trivial connection one - forms in terms of the basis @xmath62 and then to impose certain conditions on the torsion and curvature of the connection to uniquely determine the functions @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath78 , @xmath50 and @xmath79 .",
    "using cartan s structure equations @xmath80 and imposing @xmath81 on the torsion two - forms , we find that @xmath82 where    @xmath83    for any function @xmath84 . equation ( [ torsion cond ] ) has the following geometrical meaning : given a point in @xmath16 and two vectors , we construct a _ geodesic parallelogram from that point ( see @xcite ) ; then in order to come back to the same point , we only need a translation in the null direction @xmath68 . if the parallelogram is on the null surface ( when @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) , no translation is needed . _",
    "furthermore , if we require @xmath87 we find that @xmath88 the geometrical meaning of ( [ curvaturecond ] ) is that the above curvature two - form should vanish when @xmath68 is parallely transported around a parallelogram with one of its sides being the null geodesic generated by @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "summarizing , conditions ( [ torsion cond ] ) and ( [ curvaturecond ] ) suffice to uniquely determine the non trivial components of the connection one - form .",
    "they are given by    @xmath89    using the above equations one determines the remaining coefficients for the torsion and curvature in terms of @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , the only non trivial coefficient of the torsion is given by    @xmath91    a connection compatible with a lorenztian metric constructed in this way was called by cartan a normal metric connection .",
    "the main result of cartan can be stated as follows :    to each third order ordinary differential equation ( up to diffeomorphism in @xmath32 ) one can associate a null bundle with a unique normal metric connection and viceversa , i.e. to each bundle of null directions with normal metric connection one can associate a third order ordinary differential equation up to diffeomorphism .",
    "one special class of cartan s connection is particularly interesting to us .",
    "if we impose @xmath92 , the connection is torsion free and the monge s equation @xmath93 is constant along the fiber , since @xmath94    thus , the condition @xmath92 defines a unique conformal structure on the solution space of ( [ eq : thirdorder ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath92 is also the condition that the third order ode must satisfy so that the contact of two neighboring integral curves can be given by a monge s equation of the second order between the parameters of those curves @xcite .",
    "note that even in the case that the connection is torsion free , the metric so obtained depends on @xmath8 , i.e. we have a monoparametric family of conformally related metrics .",
    "we now turn our attention to the nsf formulation , in which we have a function @xmath7 satisfying a third - order ode @xmath95 with @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath12 a smooth generic function . the solutions to this equation",
    "are of the form @xmath96 , with @xmath35 representing three constants of integration which define the 3-dim manifold of solutions @xmath16 ( equivalent to @xmath97 ) .",
    "note that the function @xmath98 plays a double role , namely :    * for each fixed @xmath15 in @xmath16 , @xmath96 yields a curve @xmath99 on @xmath0 with coordinates @xmath100 ; these curves will be called cuts .",
    "* fixing @xmath100 in @xmath0 , the relation @xmath96 defines now a surface @xmath101 living in @xmath16 .",
    "it is important to realize that the analysis is merely done at a local level , so that the curve @xmath99 is certainly the graph of a function in @xmath0 and @xmath101 turns out to be a smooth surface in @xmath16 .",
    "the key assumption of nsf comes when we require that , for any value of @xmath27 and @xmath8 , @xmath101 be indeed a null surface of some space - time metric @xmath102 to be attached to @xmath16 .",
    "this condition implies that for fixed values of @xmath15 and arbitrary values of @xmath8 the gradient of @xmath17 satisfies @xmath103 note that as the families of foliations intersect at a single but arbitrary point @xmath15 , the enveloping surface forms the light cone of the point @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath8 spans the circle of null directions .",
    "the idea now is to consider ( [ null ] ) as an algebraic equation from which the five components of the conformal metric can be determined in terms of @xmath105 . given an arbitrary function @xmath17 , the problem has no solution since we have an infinite number of algebraic equations ( one for each value of @xmath8 ) for five unknowns .",
    "therefore , we must impose conditions on @xmath106 so that a solution exists .",
    "the solution and conditions are obtained by repeatedly operating @xmath107 on  ( @xmath108  [ null ] ) .",
    "they are best expressed when written in the canonical coordinate system @xmath109 given in eq.([coord ] ) .",
    "the final expression for the metric components reads    @xmath110    where the conformal factor must satisfy the differential equation ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath111 so that the metric is independent of @xmath8 .",
    "note that the above equation is invariant under @xmath112 for an arbitrary @xmath113 .",
    "this freedom is a consequence of the conformal invariance of the formulation .",
    "the metricity condition is given by @xmath114\\equiv 2\\left ( \\frac{{d(\\partial _ { r}\\lambda \\,)}}{{d\\phi } } -\\partial _ { \\omega}\\lambda \\,-{\\frac{2}{9}}(\\partial _ { r}\\lambda \\,)^{2}\\right )",
    "\\partial _ { r}\\lambda \\,-\\frac{{d^{2}(\\partial _ { r}\\lambda \\,)}}{{d\\phi } ^{2 } } + 3\\frac{{d(\\partial _",
    "{ \\omega}\\lambda \\,)}}{{d\\phi } } -6\\partial _ { u}\\lambda \\,=0,\\ ] ] and constraints the available @xmath12s that must enter in the differential equation ( [ eq : ode ] ) , for only if @xmath13=0 $ ] holds , one is able to construct from the solutions @xmath115 to the ode a metric according to ( [ metric ] ) such that the level surfaces @xmath116 of @xmath17 are its characteristic surfaces . note that this condition is the one deduced by cartan imposing the connection in the three dimensional manifold @xmath16 to be torsion free ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "summarizing , one solves @xmath117=0 $ ] , which is a partial differential equation in the variables @xmath118 and , denoting by @xmath119 its solution and using the coordinates definitions ( [ coord ] ) , equation ( [ eq : ode ] ) becomes @xmath120 which is the ode whose solutions @xmath115 allow for the construction of a metric @xmath36 on @xmath16 such that the level surfaces of @xmath17 are its null hypersurfaces .",
    "it is clear from the above that the nsf construction is the special case of the cartan s geometric structure with vanishing torsion .",
    "by assumption , both cartan s and the nsf are local constructions in the 2-dim manifold .",
    "it follows from this that the cuts @xmath121 are families of smooth curves and ( as we will see below ) that the level sets @xmath122 are smooth null surfaces of the induced metric in the 3-dim solution space .",
    "it also follows from the above assumption that these formalisms are not capable to include the caustics that null surfaces necessarily possess @xcite .",
    "moreover , one might foresee that the families of cuts that yield these null surfaces with caustics will also fail to be smooth , developing self - intersections and singular points .",
    "thus , in this section , we are faced with the problem of generalizing the geometric constructions presented in the previous section to include the description of singularities of both , cuts and null hypersurfaces .",
    "our starting assumption is that the cuts develop caustics in the 2-dim space .",
    "technically this means that cuts are projections onto @xmath0 of a ( smooth ) legendrian submanifold and the caustics arise where the projection map fails to be one to one . in a similar way as in @xcite , we use a generating function to describe a cut in the neighborhood of a caustic . using this function",
    "we will be able to see how @xmath90 diverges at a caustic point . since the original equation and the metricity condition",
    "become useless around that point , we will obtain a regularized metricity condition to select the class of generating functions which yield conformal metrics on the solution space .",
    "we will also show that caustics come inseparably paired in the cartan and nsf constructions , in the sense that the existence of caustics in the cut implies the same singular behavior in the null surfaces of the manifold @xmath16 ( and viceversa ) .",
    "the section ends with an example of a generating function in a minkowskian space - time .",
    "the regular solutions of ( [ eq : ode ] ) can be used to define smooth curves on the so called projective cotangent space of @xmath0 with local coordinates @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the momentum canonically conjugated to @xmath8 .",
    "the curves are given by    @xmath125    with @xmath15 parameters to be interpreted as coordinates in the solution space .",
    "these smooth curves are called legendrian submanifolds and the projection of these submanifolds onto the space @xmath100 gives the local description of the cuts of @xmath0 .",
    "the above equations describe the legendrian submanifolds in the diffeomorphic region since the coordinate @xmath8 is used as a parameter to describe these curves .    in order to describe the cuts in regions containing caustic points , we introduce a generating function of the form @xmath126 . in this case",
    "the legendrian submanifold is given locally as    @xmath127    where @xmath128 denotes the derivative of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath129 holding @xmath15 fixed .",
    "the above equations locally describe smooth curves on the projective cotangent space of @xmath0 .",
    "note that the projection of these curves onto the space @xmath100 is not necessarily a diffeomorphism , since @xmath8 fails to be injective in @xmath129 when @xmath130 vanishes .",
    "therefore , this description includes caustic points in a natural way .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath90 diverges at the caustic points . for this",
    "we analyze the behavior of the coordinates @xmath131 and the function @xmath12 as we approach a caustic in @xmath0 .",
    "these variables , expressed in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath129 , become    @xmath132    and since @xmath133 we obtain @xmath134    since at a caustic point @xmath135 , we see from equations ( [ eq : coord ] ) that both @xmath27 and @xmath136 are bounded while @xmath137 and @xmath90 diverge at that point",
    ". one might argue that @xmath23 could be such that @xmath138 also vanishes at a caustic point in such a way that @xmath90 remains finite .",
    "however , smoothness requires @xmath23 to be expandable as a polynomial around a caustic point .",
    "thus @xmath139 is always a polynomial of lower degree than @xmath140 and the previous argument does not apply .",
    "it follows from these considerations that @xmath141 the third order ode ( [ eq : ode ] ) will not be defined around caustic points and @xmath142 the coordinate system , metric construction and metricity condition will not be regular on the 3-dim solution space .",
    "we look then for a regular third order ode where the right hand side of this equation satisfies a regularized metricity condition . for this",
    "we introduce a new set of coordinates @xmath143 . in terms of these coordinates",
    "we have @xmath144 and the metricity condition @xmath29=0 $ ] becomes    @xmath145 & = & g^{\\prime \\prime } \\left ( 2(\\tilde{\\lambda}_{p}+g^{\\prime } \\tilde{\\lambda}_{g})\\tilde{\\lambda}_{g^{\\prime \\prime } } -3\\tilde{\\lambda}\\frac{d}{dp}\\tilde{\\lambda}_{g^{\\prime \\prime } } -5\\frac{d\\tilde{\\lambda}}{dp}\\tilde{\\lambda}_{g^{\\prime \\prime } } + 2\\tilde{\\lambda}(\\tilde{\\lambda}_{g^{\\prime \\prime } } ) ^{2}\\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\,g^{\\prime \\prime } \\left ( 3\\frac{d^{2}\\tilde{\\lambda}}{dp^{2}}-3\\frac{d}{dp}(\\tilde{\\lambda}_{p}+g^{\\prime } \\tilde{\\lambda}_{g})\\right ) + ( g^{\\prime \\prime } ) ^{2}\\left ( 2\\tilde{\\lambda}_{g^{\\prime \\prime } } \\frac{d}{dp}\\tilde{\\lambda}_{g^{\\prime \\prime } } -6\\tilde{\\lambda}_{g}\\right )   \\label{eq : metreg } \\\\ & & -\\,(g^{\\prime \\prime } ) ^{2}\\left ( \\frac{4}{9}(\\tilde{\\lambda}_{g^{\\prime \\prime } } ) ^{3}+\\frac{d^{2}}{dp^{2}}\\tilde{\\lambda}_{g^{\\prime \\prime } } \\right ) + 3\\tilde{\\lambda}\\left ( ( \\tilde{\\lambda}_{p}+g^{\\prime } \\tilde{\\lambda}_{g})+\\tilde{\\lambda}\\tilde{\\lambda}_{g^{\\prime \\prime } } -\\frac{d\\tilde{\\lambda}}{dp}\\right ) = 0 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149 for any function @xmath150 .",
    "note that the above equation is regular in a neighborhood of the caustic ( @xmath151 ) .    finally , to obtain null surfaces and study them near a caustic , we proceed in a similar way as we did in the diffeormophic region ,",
    "i.e. we first solve @xmath29=0 $ ] . denoting by @xmath152 a particular solution to this equation",
    "we then generate solutions of the ordinary differential equation @xmath153 and construct families of curves with caustics on @xmath0 .",
    "note that in the @xmath154 space the solutions to ( [ eq : odeg ] ) will generate smooth curves . to construct the families of curves with caustics",
    "one must use @xmath23 as the generating function of the contact transformation ( [ contact ] ) and the null surfaces are given by the conditions @xmath27 = const .",
    ", @xmath8 = const .",
    "note that the contact transformation ( [ contact ] ) induces a coordinate transformation ( [ eq : coord ] ) which preserves the metric tensor defined on @xmath16 .",
    "thus , cartan s theorem 2.1 is immediately generalized to include coordinate and contact transformations on @xmath0 .      in this subsection",
    ", we prove that the existence of caustic points in the cuts yields the existence of caustic points in the null surfaces of @xmath16 and viceversa .",
    "as it is known ( @xcite ) , the divergence of a congruence of null geodesics @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) becomes infinite at a caustic .",
    "therefore , to prove our assertions , we will derive a relation between @xmath157 of a congruence contained in the null surface and the scalar @xmath158 constructed from the general solution @xmath14 to ( [ eq : ode ] ) .",
    "let @xmath159 be the tangent vector to a geodesic with affine parameter @xmath160 , then @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the form - basis and its corresponding dual vector - basis associated with the canonical coordinate system ( [ coord ] ) .    to this tangent vector",
    "we associate a triad @xmath164 parallely propagated along the geodesic satisfying @xmath165 in this frame the metric tensor and the divergence become @xmath166 respectively .",
    "since @xmath167 and @xmath168 are coordinate vectors they satisfy @xmath169 expresing the geodesic deviation vector @xmath167 in terms of the triad    @xmath170    in ( [ eq : gamma ] ) gives    @xmath171 or equivalently @xmath172 on the other hand we can easily derive a differential equation for the divergence by considering the geodesic deviation equation as follows : @xmath173 since @xmath159 is a tangent vector of a null geodesic and the triad is parallely propagated along it , using ( [ eq : devi ] ) we obtain @xmath174 with @xmath175 .",
    "finally , from ( [ eq : rho ] ) , we see that @xmath157 must satisfy the differential equation @xmath176    to prove our claims we start with the general solution @xmath14 to ( [ eq : ode ] ) , and we assume that the cut @xmath177 has a caustic at @xmath178 . as we have seen in the previous subsection , this is equivalent to say that the function @xmath179 diverges at @xmath180 . to show that there is a caustic in the null surface defined by @xmath181",
    ", we must prove that @xmath182 , with @xmath183 .    from ( [ eq : la ] ) it follows that @xmath184 with the coordinate @xmath185 . as @xmath186 and @xmath187",
    "are regular operators near @xmath188 , the factor @xmath189 must be a non zero smooth function of @xmath190 .",
    "hence @xmath191 , meaning that the conformal factor @xmath192 diverges when we approach a caustic in the cut .    finally , noting that @xmath193 , we express @xmath194 in terms of the conformal factor in the following manner @xmath195 therefore @xmath196 which yields @xmath197 we conclude that when @xmath190 goes to zero ( in a singular point of the cut ) @xmath198 diverges , i.e. we approach a caustic of the null surface .",
    "it remains now to prove that a caustic in the null surface leads to the same singular behaviour in the cut .",
    "suppose that the null surface is defined by @xmath199 , then near a caustic point @xmath200 in the surface the solution of the differential equation ( [ eq : diff ] ) in the flat case yields    @xmath201 where the singular point @xmath202 corresponds to @xmath203 .",
    "by means of ( [ eq : rho ] ) we find @xmath204 , thus the conformal factor @xmath192 diverges when we approach a caustic in the null surface and since @xmath205 , @xmath137 diverges ( for @xmath160 is the affine parameter of the curve and so @xmath206 is bounded ) at @xmath202 .",
    "on the other hand we know that @xmath177 is a solution of ( [ eq : ode ] ) , then at the singular point @xmath202 the function @xmath207 diverges .",
    "thus , the cut @xmath177 also has a caustic point at @xmath178 .",
    "note that the spaces @xmath0 and @xmath16 , used to describe the cuts and null surfaces respectively , are not related in any way .",
    "the only tool that was used to prove the above results relating the cuts with null surfaces is the starting ode ( [ eq : ode ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast with similar results obtained in 3 and 4 dimensions where the reciprocity theorem for null congruences and the assumption that @xmath0 is a hypersurface of @xmath16 is explicitly used in the proof @xcite .",
    "an arbitrary constant function is clearly a solution of the metricity condition @xmath30=0 $ ] , which yields a polynomial of third degree in @xmath129 for @xmath23 .",
    "therefore we choose @xmath208 and ( [ eq : odeg ] ) yields @xmath209    with this generating function the legendre submanifold is given parametrically by @xmath210    the projection of this submanifold onto @xmath0 , @xmath211 , is the cut and possesses a cusp - like caustic when @xmath212 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath213 is not an injective function of @xmath129 , there are two values of @xmath129 for each @xmath213 , namely @xmath214    inserting this expression into equation ( [ eq : u ] ) we obtain the corresponding space - time coordinates @xmath215    it is clear from ( [ eq : pphi ] ) that @xmath216 becomes null in the caustic , hence @xmath137 diverges while @xmath27 and @xmath217 remain bounded at this point .",
    "figure 2 shows a null surface and null geodesics on it for @xmath218 , which end tangent to the caustic curve .",
    "the above generating function gives @xmath219 , which yields a flat metric for the conformal factor @xmath220 .",
    "we have shown in this work how the 3-dim nsf can be recast in terms of a well known mathematical frame , like cartan s geometrical theory of differential equations . in this manner",
    ", the metricity condition of nsf becomes a simple geometric imposition within the cartan s framework , namely the vanishing of the torsion of the connection in the space @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , both constructions have been extended from their local scopes to the non - differentiable regions , in order to account for the singular behavior that null surfaces necessarily possess . as result of this extension ,    * a generalized version of the metricity condition was obtained , whose solutions yield null foliations of a 2 + 1 dimensional manifold with caustics and other singularities that the local construction of nsf by definition is not capable to describe .",
    "* the singularities of cuts and null surfaces were shown to be closely related in the sense that the singular behavior in one of them induces a similar behaviour in the other .    at this point",
    ", one can think of applying the same ideas of this work to the original 4-dim version of nsf @xcite .",
    "this would imply a change from ordinary differential equations over partial ones , since the variable @xmath17 now depends on two coordinates @xmath221 on @xmath222 and is subject to the following system of pdes : @xmath223 @xmath224 where @xmath225 are the partial derivatives of @xmath17 with respect to the coordinates .",
    "since the above system of equations is integrable , its solution space can be parametrized by four constants @xmath15 , which locally define the 4-dim solution space @xmath226 .",
    "thus , one would be able in principle to construct an @xmath227 bundle over @xmath226 and attach a similar set of geometric structures that have been presented in this paper .",
    "if this program can be done , the nsf could be described within a well established context of differential equations ; one would be able to give a geometrical interpretation to the metricity conditions ( possibly in terms of requirements analog to the vanishing of the torsion ) .",
