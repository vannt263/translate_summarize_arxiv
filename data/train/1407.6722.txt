    "as it is well known , the plain wave solution of the maxwell electrodynamics system yields the dispersion relation @xmath1 , which is the characteristic expression of minkowski geometry .",
    "propagation of electromagnetic waves on a curved manifold of gr is governed by the dispersion relation of a similar form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a wave covector . from this basic expression of the pseudo - riemann geometry one",
    "immediately derives that gr does not modify the point - wise light cone structure .    on the other hand",
    ", modern field theories usually predict crucial modifications of the light cone structure expressed by an anisotropic dispersion relation , a birefringent vacuum and a violation of local lorentz and cpt invariance .",
    "such theoretical phenomena emerge in loop quantum gravity @xcite , @xcite , string theory @xcite , @xcite and the very special relativity models @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since these models are still very far from their complete form and observational predictions , it is very important to have a phenomenological model that predicts the indicated optics phenomena .",
    "a well known achievement in this direction is the standard model extension ( sme ) construction due to kostelecky and al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the electromagnetic sector of this construction ,",
    "one starts with a covariant extension of the electromagnetic lagrangian involving a set of numerical parameters .",
    "the resulting field equations indeed yield solutions with breaking cpt symmetry and birefringence .",
    "however , the individual terms in the lagrangian , apart from their covariance property , remain without a clear physical meaning .",
    "another approach is based on a generalization of riemann geometry to a generic finsler geometry .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite for theoretical description , and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for observable effects analysis . ) since finslerian geometry is anisotropic from its very definition , the modified dispersion relation with cpt - violation and birefringence naturally emerges in this construction .",
    "what is unclear , however , is the physical reason for the finslerian modification of space - time structure .",
    "moreover , the finsler geometry of the lorentz type signature has serious problems with its very definition , that have not been resolved yet , see @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study an alternative approach inspired by ideas from solid state physics .",
    "it is well known that the original formulation of maxwell s electrodynamics and gr uses the medium analogy to a considerable extent .",
    "it is rather natural to expect that solid state analogies may be useful for the modern modifications of gr and other field theories .",
    "it should be taken into account that classical gr is dealing only with a relatively simple second order metric tensor while solid state physics ( elasticity and electromagnetism ) uses tensors of a higher order . in modified field theory models ,",
    "higher order tensors appear in a natural way .    electromagnetic wave propagation in media is a classical issue of mathematical physics .",
    "the standard presentation of this subject , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , is essentially non - relativistic ( 3-dimensional ) .",
    "usually textbooks restrict themselves to an isotropic medium characterized by two scalar parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 or to an anisotropic medium described by two symmetric @xmath6 matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is clear , however , that a proper description of wave propagation must be presented in terms of 4-dimensional tensorial quantities defined on space - time .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the very existence of wave propagation should be independent of a motion of an observer .",
    "furthermore , the propagation of waves in an anisotropic medium must be described by the medium parameters .",
    "it is not directly connected to the vacuum minkowski metric .",
    "thus the description of the electromagnetic wave phenomena must be independent of the metric structure of the space - time .",
    "it is well known , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , that such a metric - free description of classical electromagnetism is admissible . in this generic formalism",
    ", vacuum electrodynamics on a flat space - time and even on a curved space - time of general relativity is presented as specially simple cases .",
    "recent investigations established the metric - free electrodynamics as a logically complete construction based on the conservation laws for the electric charge , the magnetic flux , and the energy - momentum current .",
    "for details , see @xcite and the references given therein .",
    "one of the valuable achievements of this construction is the proof that the most general linear electromagnetic medium is characterized by a set of 36 independent parameters that form a 4-th order pseudo - tensor @xmath9 .",
    "this replaces the set of 12 material parameters given by two 6-parametric sets , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in the classical representation . due to the standard group theory paradigm ,",
    "the pseudo - tensor @xmath9 is decomposed into three independent pieces : ( i ) the _ principal part _",
    "@xmath10 with 20 independent components ; ( ii ) the _ skewon part _",
    "@xmath11 with 15 independent components ; ( iii ) the _ axion part _",
    "@xmath12 with 1 component .",
    "these pieces are unique , canonical , and irreducible under the action of the general linear group @xmath13 .",
    "the principle part , @xmath10 , comes as a covariant extension of the classical set of 12 components of the 3-dimensional tensors @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the other two parts , the skewon @xmath11 and the axion @xmath12 , do not have classical analogs .",
    "the current paper is devoted to the theoretical description of wave propagation in a generic linear response medium .",
    "our aim is to understand the possible new physical phenomena coming from the additional electromagnetic parameters .",
    "recently there has been considerable progress in this area , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "here we are interested mostly in the skewon effects on the light cone structure .",
    "it must be noted that skewon does not contribute to the electromagnetic lagrangian , thus such effects can not be appear in kostelecky s construction nor in finsler space schemes .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we introduce our basic notations and present the integral maxwell equations and jump conditions in a metric - free form .",
    "we discuss the linear constitutive relation .",
    "the decomposition of the constitutive tensor is based on the technique young diagrams .",
    "it proves that the decomposition is irreducible and unique ( canonical ) . in section 3",
    ", we give a generic definition of the wave - type solutions and present the dispersion relation for these solutions .",
    "the characteristic system is derived from the jump conditions .",
    "we show that it is completely described by a christoffel - type tensor @xmath14 which is a close analog of the acoustic christoffel 3d - matrix .",
    "we provide a decomposition of @xmath14 into two independent optic tensors @xmath15 and @xmath16 defined by the principal and the skewon part correspondingly . moreover , the show that skewon part @xmath16 is of the form @xmath17 .",
    "thus the covector @xmath18 completely describes skewon effects . in section 4 , the dispersion relation in terms of the tensors @xmath15 and @xmath16 is derived .",
    "we are able to express the whole contribution of the skewon to the light cone structure in one compact term , which thus allows a qualitative analysis .",
    "section 5 is devoted to an analysis of the skewon effects on the wave propagation in a ( pseudo)riemannian vacuum .",
    "in particular , we prove that an arbitrary skewon extends the light cone and thus yields superluminal wave propagation . in section 6",
    "we study the special case of an antisymmetric skewon .",
    "we reinstate the known fact that the fresnel surface separates into two surfaces .",
    "we prove that both surfaces have the lorentz signature and can thus serve as light cones .",
    "moreover we show that for an antisymmetric skewon these cones always intersect along two optic axes .",
    "the variety of mutual arrangements is still rich . in particular , we identify the electric , magnetic and degenerate types of antisymmetric skewon .",
    "section 7 deals with the case of the symmetric skewon .",
    "we show that in this case wave propagation does not exist for small values of the skewon parameters and reappears only for sufficient big values of the skewon .",
    "this behavior is similar to the one exhibited by the higgs model in particle physics .",
    "we describe different parametrizations of the symmetric skewon that can be characterized by the rank of a corresponding matrix .",
    "explicit examples are provided . in the concluding section ,",
    "we discuss our results and their possible extensions .",
    "some technical details are delayed to the appendix .",
    "our goal is to study wave propagation in an electromagnetic medium with a generic local linear response .",
    "vacuum can be considered as a specific type of a unique `` medium '' completely characterized by the metric tensor .",
    "in contrast , different types of real anisotropic media , be characterized each by their own sets of parameters , may present simultaneously in the same problem .",
    "we must , for instance , often deal with two media separated by a thin boundary . in phenomenological models ,",
    "such a boundary is described by a smooth 2-dimensional surface which either stationary or moving in 3-dimensional space . in the 4-dimensional space - time representation ,",
    "the stationary or moving boundaries are described in the same fashion as smooth 3-dimensional hypersurfaces .",
    "in such a situation , some components of the field necessary have a jump through the boundary surface .",
    "thus , the electromagnetic field in media is , in general , non - differentiable and the ordinarily used partial differential field equations are not directly applicable .",
    "quite similarly , the non - differentiable fields emerge in geometrical optics at the wave fronts even in the vacuum case .    a well known precise mathematical way to deal with such non - differentiable fields is to consider the integral field equations instead of the differential ones .",
    "the most natural objects for integration on a differential manifold are differential forms . from their very definition",
    ", the differential forms are correlated to the dimension of the integration domain , thus they provide a covariant formulation of physics laws .",
    "for instance , in terms of differential forms , the integral maxwell equations are given in a compact covariant form @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the even ( untwisted ) 2-form of _ field strength _ , while @xmath21 is the odd ( twisted ) 2-form of _ excitation _",
    ", @xmath22 is the odd 3-form of _ electric current_. the integration domain @xmath23 is a smooth closed 2-dimensional surface , while @xmath24 is a smooth 3-dimensional oriented hyper - surface with a smooth boundary @xmath25 .",
    "the case of non - smooth domains is sometimes also useful for physics applications .",
    "there an extension of the formulation given in eqs.([max-1 ] ) can be provided by a limiting procedure . in this paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the case of smooth integration domains .",
    "eqs.([max-1 ] ) have a clear physical interpretation .",
    "in particular , the first equation represents the conservation law of the magnetic flux .",
    "the second equation of ( [ max-1 ] ) may be viewed as a consequence of the electric current conservation law .",
    "for the details of such an interpretation , see @xcite .      in order to derive the wave - front conditions , we apply the covariant jump conditions , @xcite , that are a consequence of the integral maxwell equations ( [ max-1 ] ) .",
    "consider an arbitrary smooth non - degenerate hypersurface @xmath26 in space - time .",
    "let its implicit description be given by the equation @xmath27 thus , at an arbitrary point of @xmath26 , the covector @xmath28 is assumed to be well - defined and non - zero . here and in the sequel , the roman indices take values in the range @xmath29 we define two limit values @xmath30 the jump @xmath31 $ ] of the field strength @xmath20 at the hypersurface @xmath26 is defined as the difference of these two values @xmath32 = f_{+}-f_{-}\\,.\\ ] ] a similar definition holds for the jump @xmath33 $ ] of the excitation @xmath21 .",
    "in the source - free case , the _ jump conditions _ are given by the following covariant and metric - free equations : @xmath34 \\wedge d \\vp = 0\\,,\\qquad   \\big[\\h\\big ] \\wedge d\\vp = 0\\,.\\ ] ] these equations are straightforward consequences of the integral field equations ( [ max-1 ] ) provided the sources do not enter the region . the tensorial form of eqs.([bound - form ] ) read as @xmath35 \\vp_{,l}=0\\,,\\qquad \\big[\\h^{ij}\\big]\\vp_{,j}=0\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath36 is the permutation pseudotensor normalized by @xmath37 .",
    "since the jump conditions ( [ bound - form],[bound - form4 ] ) are metric - free , they can be used for a wide class of applications .",
    "the hyper - surface @xmath26 may represent :    ( 1 ) : :    _ a cauchy initial surface _ that is ordinarily required to be    _ time - like . _",
    "( 2 ) : :    _ a boundary surface _ that separates two different media .",
    "it is    ordinarily represented by a _",
    "space - like _ hypersurface .",
    "( 3 ) : :    _ a wavefront _ that emerges in 4-dimensional geometrical optics as a    _ light - like _ hypersurface .",
    "the covariant boundary surface problem was studied in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , when the space - time decomposition of the fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 is applied and the fields are assumed to be independent of the time coordinate , eqs.([bound - form ] ) yield the standard boundary conditions for the 3-dimensional fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in the current paper",
    ", we are dealing with electromagnetic wave propagation , i.e. , with the wavefront problems .",
    "eqs.([max-1 ] ) present only the formal structure of electromagnetism .",
    "they are endowed with a physical content only when a constitutive relation between the fields @xmath21 and @xmath20 is postulated . in general , such a relation can be non - linear and even non - local ( as in ferromagnetics ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the simplest but rather widespread case of a _ linear , local constitutive relation : _",
    "@xmath40 due to its definition , the _ constitutive pseudotensor _",
    "@xmath9 possess the symmetries @xmath41 hence , in 4-dimensional space , @xmath9 has 36 independent components . in general ,",
    "the constitutive pseudotensor is a field that depends of the point on the manifold .",
    "a useful way to deal with a multi - component tensor , such as @xmath9 , is to decompose it into the sum of simpler independent sub - tensors with fewer components . naturally , these parts must themselves be tensors of the same rank .",
    "moreover , it is preferable for this decomposition to be a _ unique and irreducible . _ in this case , to the partial sub - tensors might be endowed with independent physical meaning .",
    "so , we are are looking for a decomposition of a 4-rank tensor defined on 4-dimensional space - time .",
    "moreover , we must take into account that @xmath9 is not a general 4-th order tensor , it carries its original symmetries ( [ lin-1x ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the tensor @xmath9 itself constitutes a subspace of a generic tensor space .",
    "consequently we need a decomposition of an invariant subspace into the direct sum of its invariant ( sub)subspaces . a common way to derive such a decomposition is to apply the young diagram technique . a brief account of this subject is given in @xcite .",
    "note that a generic 4-rank tensor ( without additional symmetries ) is canonically decomposed into five sub - tensors .",
    "an important fact that these partial tensors are yet reducible .",
    "their successive decomposition is irreducible but not canonical and thus non - unique .",
    "the situation is changed drastically when we decompose a tensor with additional symmetries .",
    "first , the littlewood - richardson rule restricts the number of the relevant young s diagrams . in our case , there are only three different types of diagrams @xmath42 the dimensions of the subspaces depicted in the diagrams ( [ tab0 ] ) are 20 , 15 , and 1 , correspondingly .",
    "it proves that there is a unique decomposition of the set of the components @xmath43 inasmuch as there are no invariant subspaces of smaller dimensions , the canonical decomposition of the constitutive pseudotensor into three pieces is unique and irreducible .",

    "note that in the current setting axion appears rather naturally and is not artificially added .",
    "the _ skewon part _",
    "@xmath48 of 15 independent components corresponds to the middle diagram of ( [ tab0 ] ) .",
    "it is expressed as @xmath49    the _ principal part _ of 20 independent components corresponds to the first diagram of ( [ tab0 ] ) .",
    "it is expressed as @xmath50 it is now straightforward to check that the sum of the terms ( [ lin-4 ] ) , ( [ lin-5 ] ) , and ( [ lin-7 ] ) is equal to the initial tensor @xmath9 . a derivation of the expressions ( [ lin-4 ] ) ,",
    "( [ lin-5 ] ) , and ( [ lin-7 ] ) can be done by the young diagram technique .",
    "the result is equivalent to the derivation based on the @xmath51 representation @xcite .",
    "group theoretical considerations provide a proof that this decomposition is canonical , unique and irreducible under the action of the general linear group .",
    "our goal is to study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a medium with a generic constitutive pseudotensor @xmath9 .",
    "particularly , we are interested in the contributions of the irreducible parts @xmath52 and @xmath53 to the shape of the fresnel surface and to the corresponding light cone structure . in order to have a description that is valid for an arbitrary observer",
    ", we are looking for a covariant formulation .",
    "we need a _ covariant",
    "_ description of the electromagnetic wave in media .",
    "usually a wave is represented by a plane wave ansatz or by its generalization in series , see @xcite , @xcite for a modern review of this non - covariant approach .",
    "instead , we will apply the following covariant description that is similar to what is given in @xcite and@xcite .",
    "* definition 1 : * _ a generalized electromagnetic wave _ is a set of the solutions , @xmath20 and @xmath54 , of maxwell s system ( [ max-1])that are non - zero on one side of some hypresurface @xmath55 and zero on its other side .    with this definition , the generic jump conditions ( [ bound - form ] )",
    "take the form of the _ wavefront conditions _",
    "@xmath56 in tensorial representation with the wave covector defined as @xmath57 , they read @xmath58 the hypersurface @xmath55 appearing in definition 1 is referred to as a _ wavefront_.    an explicit expression of the wavefront is determined from the uniqueness and existence conditions for the solutions of ( [ int6b ] ) .",
    "when the linear constitutive relation ( [ lin-1 ] ) is substituted here we obtain @xmath59 this is linear system of 8 equations for 6 independent variables , the components of the tensor @xmath60 .",
    "however it is only formally overdetermined .",
    "indeed , there are two linear identities between the equations .",
    "when the left hand sides of ( [ char-1 ] ) are multiplied by @xmath61 they vanish identically due to the symmetries ( [ lin-1x ] ) .",
    "how can we deal with this formally overdetermined system",
    "? often one substitutes the constraints into ( [ char-1 ] ) and end up with a well defined system of 6 independent equations of 6 independent variables .",
    "note that the field @xmath60 is a _ measurable quantity _ , and is thus certain kind unique .",
    "therefore an _ existence and uniqueness theorem _ must hold : ( i ) for _ existence _ , the @xmath51 determinant of the matrix of the coefficients must be equal to zero .",
    "( ii ) for _ uniqueness _ , this determinant must be non - trivial .",
    "thus one comes to the @xmath51 determinant and correspondingly to a characteristic equation that is of the six order in @xmath62 .",
    "this straightforward procedure explicitly violates the covariance of the system .",
    "so a more precise question is : how can we deal with the overdetermined system ( [ char-1 ] ) without violating its covariance ?    in order to have a covariant derivation , we start with the first equation of ( [ char-1 ] ) .",
    "its most general solution is of the form @xmath63 with an arbitrary covector @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , @xmath64 can be viewed as an algebraic analog of the standard electromagnetic potential . substituting ( [ char-2 ] ) into the second equation of ( [ char-1 ] )",
    "we obtain the _ characteristic system _",
    "@xmath65 where the _ characteristic matrix _ is @xmath66 eq.([char-3 ] ) is a linear system of 4 covariant equations for the 4 components of the covector @xmath64 .",
    "now we face a new problem : since the relations @xmath67 hold identically for the matrix defined in ( [ char-3x ] ) , they can be treated as linear relations between the rows and columns of the matrix @xmath68 .",
    "consequently the system ( [ char-3 ] ) is _ undetermined .",
    "_ this was to be expected since , in contrast to @xmath69 , the potential @xmath64 is an unmeasurable quantity . consequently the solutions of ( [ char-3 ] ) can not be unique . as shown in @xcite , the relations ( [ char-3x - cc ] )",
    "correspond to the physical principles ",
    "gauge invariance and charge conservation of our system .",
    "thus , in order to preserve the gauge invariance and the covariance of the characteristic system , we must proceed with an undetermined characteristic system and with a singular characteristic matrix @xmath70 .",
    "the electromagnetic wave propagation is now described by a linear characteristic system @xmath71 . in particular , it is completely determined by the matrix @xmath70 .",
    "this matrix is an analog of the _ acoustic _ ( christoffel ) @xmath6 matrix which is used to describe the acoustic wave propagation in linear elasticity .",
    "we will refer to @xmath70 as the _ optic tensor_.    substituting the irreducible decomposition ( [ lin-3 ] ) into eq.([char-3x ] ) , we obtain @xmath72 the last term here is a contraction of symmetric and skew - symmetric matrices , thus it vanishes identically @xmath73 consequently the axion part @xmath74 does not contribute to the wave propagation .",
    "this fact does not contradicts the known results about axion modification of the dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "in fact , the axion contribution emerges only in the higher order approximation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the standard geometric optics approximation that does not take the axion contributions into account .",
    "the two other terms on the right hand side of eq.([chis-1 ] ) are in general non - zero .",
    "consequently , the optic matrix is irreducibly decomposed into the sum of two terms @xmath75 here , the _ principle optic tensor _ @xmath76 and the _ skewon optic tensor _",
    "@xmath77 are defined as @xmath78 let us list some basic properties of these two tensors :    *   _ symmetry : _ the principle optic tensor @xmath76 is symmetric while the skewon optic tensor @xmath77 is antisymmetric : @xmath79 * _ linear relations : _ since the partial pseudo - tensors @xmath80 and @xmath81 preserve the symmetries of the original pseudo - tensor @xmath9 , the linear relations of the type ( [ char-3x - cc ] ) hold also for the matrices @xmath76 and @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath82 * _ determinants : _ due to the linear relations between the columns of the matrices , we have , @xmath83 it is in addition to the relation @xmath84 .",
    "* _ adjoint of the skewon optics tensor : _ in order to have a non - trivial ( non - zero ) expression for the adjoint matrix , the rank of the original @xmath85-matrix must be equal to 3 .",
    "but the rank of an arbitrary antisymmetric matrix is even .",
    "thus our skewon matrix satisfies @xmath86    we will see in the sequel , that this fact yields that the skewon part alone does not provide a non - trivial dispersion relation .",
    "thus skewon can serve only as a supplement to the principle part .",
    "since the skewon part of the constitutive tensor contributes to the wave propagation only via the antisymmetric tensor @xmath87 , it has a simpler representation , which we now derive    we start with the relation @xmath88 it is convenient to define an auxiliary tensor @xmath89 in this notations , eq.([chis-5xx ] ) takes the form @xmath90 this equation is somewhat simpler to deal with than ( [ chis-5xx ] ) because it has exactly the same form as the first equation of the maxwell system ( [ char-1 ] ) .",
    "hence the most general solution of ( [ chis-8 ] ) can be written in the form of ( [ char-2 ] ) , @xmath91 with an arbitrary covector @xmath18 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath18 as the _ skewon optic covector .",
    "_ let us list its basic properties :    * since @xmath92 is quadratic in @xmath61 , the components of @xmath18 are the _ first order homogeneous functions _ of @xmath61 ; * @xmath18 is a _ covector density _ , because @xmath92 is a tensor density ; * due to ( [ chis-9 ] ) , @xmath18 is defined only up to an arbitrary addition of the wave covector @xmath61 .",
    "so we have here a type of a _ gauge symmetry _ which is similar to the ordinary gauge symmetry of the maxwell system ; * an additional _ gauge fixing condition _ on @xmath18 can be applied .    substituting ( [ chis-9 ] ) into eq.([chis-6 ] ) we obtain @xmath93 using the skew - symmetry , this expression can be rewritten finally as @xmath94      due to the gauge symmetry , the covector @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath95 with an arbitrary scalar @xmath96 that represents the gauge freedom .",
    "we observe that in this representation the tensor @xmath97 and the scalar @xmath96 must be zero order homogeneous functions of the wave covector @xmath98 .",
    "without loss of generality we can assume the tensor @xmath97 to be traceless , @xmath99 , because its trace can be absorbed into the scalar @xmath96 .",
    "like a traceless quadratic matrix , the skewon has 15 independent components .",
    "a representation of the skewon by a traceless mixed tensor was derived in @xcite , @xmath100 let us check that this expression meets exactly our definition ( [ mat-0 ] ) .",
    "when we substitute ( [ mat-1 ] ) into eq.([chis-3 ] ) , the skewon optic tensor becomes @xmath101 rearranging the indices we can rewrite this as @xmath102 compare eq.([mat-3 ] ) with the definition of the skewon covector ( [ chis-11 ] ) . in the brackets of ( [ mat-3 ] ) , we recognize ( up to the @xmath96-factor ) the covector @xmath18 as it appears in eq.([mat-0 ] ) .",
    "thus the tensor @xmath97 turns out to be independent of @xmath62 .",
    "alternatively , the scalar @xmath96 remains an arbitrary zero order homogeneous functions of @xmath98 .",
    "different choices of @xmath96 represent different gauge conditions . in the sequel",
    ", we will see that the lorenz - type gauge condition for the covector @xmath18 requires a non - zero and even non - regular scalar function @xmath96 .",
    "in order to have a non - trivial solution @xmath64 of the characteristic system @xmath103 the components of the wave covector @xmath61 must satisfy certain consistent relation . this _ dispersion relation _ is a polynomial algebraic equation with the coefficients depending on the media parameters .",
    "usually an equation of the form ( [ disp-1 ] ) is consistent ( has non - trivial solutions ) when the relation @xmath104 holds .",
    "the electromagnetic system , however , is a singular one , so its determinant vanishes identically .",
    "this fact is due to _ the gauge invariance of the system .",
    "_ indeed , @xmath105 is a solution of eq.([disp-1 ] ) that does not contribute to the electromagnetic field strength , so it is unphysical .",
    "hence , the system ( [ disp-1 ] ) accepts a physical meaning , only if it has at least _ two linearly independent solutions _ ",
    "one for gauge freedom and one for physics .",
    "we recall a known fact from linear algebra : a linear system has two ( or more ) linearly independent solutions if and only if the rank of its matrix @xmath14 is of 2 ( or less ) .",
    "it means that the _ adjoint _ of the matrix @xmath14 must be equal to zero .",
    "recall that the adjoint matrix is constructed from the cofactors of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , in electromagnetism , as well as in an arbitrary @xmath0-gauge invariant system , existence of physically meaningful solutions of a system @xmath106 requires @xmath107 the standard expression of the 4-th order adjoint matrix @xmath108 is of the form @xmath109 consequently the dispersion relation reads @xmath110 the condition ( [ disp-3 ] ) is somewhat unusual because it is given in a matrix form .",
    "however , we have here only one independent condition .",

    "we remain with @xmath150 thus we proved the following    @xmath151      the dispersion relation ( [ skew-14 ] ) may be given even in a more simpler form . since the covector @xmath18 is defined only up to an arbitrary addition of the covector @xmath61 , we can apply an arbitrary scalar gauge condition . on a space endowed with a metric",

    "wave propagation was forbidden in an euclidean signature model and it remains forbidden even when an arbitrary skewon field is `` switched on '' .      also for a negative signature of the metric , it is more convenient to use the dispersion relation in the lorenz gauge .",
    "thus we are dealing with the system @xmath166 in order to analyze its solutions , we first observe that the left hand side of the first equation is nonnegative , @xmath167 . if @xmath156 , then it follows that @xmath168 .",

    "the decomposition of the optic tensor into symmetric and skew symmetric parts is directly related to the irreducible decomposition of the constitutive tensor into principle and skewon parts , respectively .",

    "for all types of the antisymmetric skewon , we proved that there are exactly two optic axes and derive their explicit form .",
    "using the skewon covector formalism , we studied some new properties of the symmetric skewon models .",
    "in particular we observed the parametric gap that appears in most models , but not in all of them . in order to distinguish the different types of the symmetric skewon we used the notion of rank of the corresponding matrix .",

    "dispersion relations for the symmetric skewon models of different rank where derived .",
    "we worked out some specific examples that present different types of modified light cone structures .",
    "our analysis shows that a skewon field is able to describe certain new types of lorentz violations in electrodynamics that are not accounted for in models based on a modified lagrangian .    in our opinion",
    ", the skewon model provides a rich subject for algebraical analysis and the physical considerations of the modified light cone structure .",
    "it is straightforward to observe that the unusual features of wave propagation in the skewon media are mostly related to the real skewon .",
