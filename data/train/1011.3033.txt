    "the units of @xmath3 is nano newton ( nn).,width=288 ]    we achieve such an asymmetric stress profile in our simulation by transversely stressing a half of the gnr .",
    "for example , we apply a constant force @xmath3 on the atoms of the top and bottom edges of the right half of the @xmath4- agnr as depicted in fig.[fig : agnrforce]b . the tensile stress developed across the @xmath59 direction of the right half",
    "is denoted by @xmath60 .",
    "this lateral stress produces a tensile strain along the y direction and , hence a compressive strain along the @xmath5-direction due to the poisson contraction .",
    "since the atoms in the left and right edges are fixed , this compressive strain also results in tensile stress in the x - direction .",
    "the stress in the @xmath5-direction near the left and right hb is denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is calculated from the time average of the forces on the fixed atoms at the left and right edges(excluding the corner atoms ) .",

    "thus , the @xmath67 is considerably larger than @xmath68 whenever @xmath69 , marking the existence of thermal rectification in this system",
    ".    the tensile stress and strain can affect the thermal transport by distorting the lattice to both alter the characteristic vibrational frequencies and the degree of anharmonicity.@xcite anharmonicity is essential : _ no amount of geometric or parameter asymmetry can produce thermal rectification . _ without anharmonicity , the system can be analyzed via normal modes , and time reversal symmetry will require that transmission amplitudes from left to right are the same as right to left .",
    "we attribute the observed thermal rectification to the strain induced asymmetry of the vibrational frequencies and the lattice anharmonicity .",
    "such an asymmetry of the vibrational properties leads to a local variation of @xmath2 .",
    "it can be shown that the thermal conductivity must be a function of both position and temperature to rectify the thermal current.@xcite    we can invoke the framework of non - equilibrium thermodynamics to describe this effect .",
    "the change of the entropy per unit volume of a solid due to the applied stress ( @xmath70 ) can be expressed@xcite , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the change of internal energy density , @xmath73 is the strain and @xmath74}$ ] . from this",
    "we can deduce the rate of production of entropy@xcite , @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the @xmath78-th components of the energy and the strain currents , and repeated indices are summed over . in general the currents are a function of the intensive parameters ( t and @xmath79 ) as well as the affinities@xcite ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "thus the heat current , @xmath82 , can be expanded in its most general form :    @xmath83 in solids , barring plastic deformation , there is no heat current in steady state solely due to @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the coefficients @xmath85 . moreover , in symmetric systems there is no thermal rectification , which implies @xmath86 .",
    "if we further assume only gradients in the @xmath5-direction and stress in the @xmath59-direction the above equation can be reduced to , @xmath87 which leads to different thermal currents when switching the sign of the stress gradient ( @xmath81 ) . for the case of @xmath63",

    "k as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the open circles are in the presence of edge disorder(edo ) and the open triangles are in the presence of vacancy defects(vd ) .",
    ", width=288 ]    the distinctive property of this approach is the tunability of the thermal rectification by an asymmetrically applied force , @xmath3 .",
    "we show in fig.[trfac ] the thermal rectification factor ( tr ) as a function of @xmath3 calculated at @xmath61 k. the tr is defined as , @xmath91 we observe an increment of the tr when increasing the @xmath3 .",
    "the increment of tr with @xmath3 is more prominent at higher biases ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "as shown in the fig.[trec]b , the @xmath93 increases almost linearly with the bias ( @xmath17 ) , whereas @xmath68 increases nonlinearly giving rise to a larger tr .",
    "this behavior suggests the contribution of higher order terms ( beyond the second order ) to eq.[ps2 ] .",
    "the nonlinear transport is an essential property in realizing thermal rectification as in an electronic diode . in our system",
    "the nonlinear transport is prominent at larger @xmath3 s ( @xmath94 nn ) , where we observe a clear bias dependence of tr .",
    "the maximum tr we observed is about @xmath95 which occurred at @xmath92 and @xmath96 nn .    the right side of the agnr is subjected to a biaxial stress whereas the left side only has an uniaxial stress .",
    "it is evident that the asymmetry of the on axis stresses ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) is important in determining the tr .",
    "we achieve a significant tr whenever the ratio @xmath97 ( see fig.[forces]b ) .",
    "when we move the laterally stressed window towards the center , the tr reduced considerably in our simulation .",
    "this is a reasonable observation , because the asymmetry of the system is reduced .",
    "for instance , when we move the laterally stressed window eight columns towards the center ( keeping the number of atoms that @xmath3 is applied constant ) the tr decrease to @xmath98 at @xmath92 and @xmath63 nn . in this situation , the ratio of stresses reduces to @xmath99 which is close to the ratio at @xmath100 nn where the observed tr is about @xmath101 .",
    "when the length of the nanoribbon is increased , the strain gradient reduces and results a reduction of thermal rectification ( implies from the eq.[hflux ] ) .",
    "however , by increasing the length of the agnr and also the number of atoms that @xmath3 is applied , we could increase the strain gradient and observe a larger tr .",
    "graphene commonly possesses edge disorder which significantly degrade the thermal properties . in fig.[trfac ] the open circles shows the variation of tr in the presence of edge disorder .",
    "since the simulated agnrs are very small , we introduce only about a @xmath102 ( percentage of number of edge atoms removed ) edge disorder .",
    "we observe moderate reduction of tr , down to a value @xmath103 .",
    "the effect of edge disorder can be reduced by increasing the width of the nanoribbon .",
    "however , the presence of vacancy defects significantly reduces the tr .",
    "the open triangles in fig.[trfac ] is for @xmath104 vacancy defects distributed evenly in the nanoribbon .",
    "experimentally , the lateral force on the right half of the agnr can be applied by coupling to a substrate .",
    "our simulation fixed the atoms to which the forces were applied .",
    "this situation also produces larger thermal rectification(over @xmath105 ) at higher biases and the direction of the maximum thermal current is same as before .",
    "this effect can be understood by the argument in ref.@xcite .",
    "consequently the observable net thermal rectification could be even higher due to the asymmetric coupling between the gnr and the substrate .",
    "electronic transport of heat will occur in parallel to the phonon conduction , but is not so large that it dwarfs the phonon channel considered here .",
    "in addition , agnrs shows semiconducting characteristics and their energy gap can be tuned with the strain@xcite .",
    "thus , the electronic contribution to the thermal transport should not be crucial .",
    "electron - phonon interactions could lead to processes that undermine the thermal rectification .",
    "we believe that their contribution to the thermal rectification is also minimal since the nanoribbon is semiconducting .",
    "in addition , the long electronic coherence length in graphene indicates that electron - phonon interactions should not be significant . in experiments ,",
    "these effects can be further minimized by electronically gating the sample .",
    "finally , we discuss the stability of the c - c bonds in graphene under the lateral forces . we do not observe any rupture of bonds within the applied range of @xmath3 ( @xmath106 nn ) . in our simulation",
    "the estimated maximum force in the c - c bond direction is about @xmath107 nn , which is correspond to a lateral stress of @xmath108 gpa .",
    "in a recent experiment , it has been found that the intrinsic strength of a single layer graphene is about @xmath109 gpa assuming the van der waals thickness of graphene @xcite .",
    "when the @xmath3 is increased to @xmath110 nn , we observe rupturing of some bonds near the fixed atoms in the right side of the agnr . at this point , the maximum force in the c - c bond direction is about @xmath111 nn . thus , the forces required to realize thermal rectification by our method , are realistic and in an experimentally feasible range .",
    "in conclusion , we study the thermal transport properties of strained gnrs using md simulations .",
    "we demonstrate that the thermal rectification can be realized by engineering the stress on a rectangular agnr .",
    "we have found that the heat transport is favorable from the less stressed region to the more stressed region .",
    "we also found that edge defects and vacancies only partially suppress this rectification .",
    "the major advantage of this approach is that the thermal rectification can be tuned from no rectification state to over @xmath0 in real - time by applying a mechanical force .",
