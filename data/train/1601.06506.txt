    "after the symmetry breaking theory of landau @xcite , many thought science has reached a comprehensive understanding of different phases of matter . however , a new concept emerged in condense matter physics by quantum hall effect @xcite , quantum spin fluids @xcite and superconductors @xcite which was called topological order .",
    "topological order is a different phase of matter which can not understood by landau theory so that one can find different topological phases with the same symmetries @xcite .",
    "+ the ground state of a quantum system with topological order exhibits a long - range entanglement @xcite .",
    "specifically , the topological entanglement entropy has been defined as a non - local order parameter of topological order @xcite so that it can characterize a quantum phase transition from a topological phase @xcite .",
    "another interesting property of a topological phase is the behavior of the wilson loop where the expectation value of the wilson loop is related to perimeter of the loop in a topological phase , while it is related to area of the loop in a non - topological phase @xcite .",
    "+ long - range entanglement of the ground state of a topological matter also leads to some interesting and exotic properties which have not been seen in symmetry breaking phases .",
    "robust degeneracy of the ground state and exotic statistics of excitations of the system , which are called anyons , are two important characteristics of the topological phases @xcite .",
    "braiding anyons leads to an arbitrary phase factor on wave function of the system in the abelian models and a unitary operator in the non - abelian models @xcite .",
    "the robustness of degeneracy of the ground state and braiding operators against local perturbations is a key property of the topological phases which has converted them to important candidates for fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "+ in spite of many improvements on defining different characteristics of a topological phase , recognizing different topological classes in different quantum systems @xcite is still an open problem which has received much deal of interest . since",
    "topological order is a kind of quantum order , it is clear that the same quantum phases have also the same topological phases .",
    "consequently , considering quantum phase transition between different topological models is a useful approach for classification of topological models .",
    "specifically , there are some recent papers which show a quantum phase transition can well reveal different topological properties of two different topological phases @xcite .",
    "+ this thought that a quantum phase transition reveals necessarily different topological classes of the quantum phases is challenged specifically by 1d quantum models . it has been shown that all 1d quantum phases belong to a trivial topological phase @xcite so that one can find a quantum phase transition between two different 1d quantum models which are topologically trivial @xcite .",
    "in fact , since topological signature of topological phases such as topological entanglement entropy or expectation value of the wilson loop operators can not be defined for a 1d model , topological order of 1d models only defines as a symmetry protected topological phase @xcite .",
    "+ moreover 1d quantum models which are in the same topological phases , there are also two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum models which belong to a universal topological phase . a well - known example of universal topological phases has been seen in the toric code model ( tc ) with @xmath0 topological order @xcite and the color code model ( cc ) with @xmath1 topological order @xcite .",
    "since the tc and cc model have different gauge symmetries , degeneracies of the ground state of them are different .",
    "while the tc model provides a four - fold degenerate ground state which can be used as a robust quantum memory , degeneracy of the ground state of the cc model is sixteen - fold .",
    "furthermore , unlike the tc model , there is also possibility of applying unitary clifford group in a topological way @xcite .",
    "recently , there is also an experimental realization of the color code on trapped - ion qubits @xcite .",
    "+ although different degeneracies of the cc model and the tc model show that they are in two different quantum phases , other topological characteristics of both models are completely the same . especially , it is possible to show a cc model and two copies of the tc model are in the same quantum phases @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have emphasized that since there is an adiabatic evolution without quantum phase transition between a cc model and two copies of the tc model , they have the same topological phases .",
    "this result shows that different quantum phases of the tc and the cc model are completely related to their different gauge symmetries and has not a topological nature .",
    "+ by above facts , there is a good chance that one considers how the same topological characteristics of the cc and the tc model reflects in the properties of a quantum phase transition between them . to this end , in this paper we consider a cc model on a hexagonal lattice besides a single tc model instead of two copies of it on the same lattice .",
    "we show the universal topological phase of the cc and the tc model reflects in properties of the quantum phase transition where we show that the quantum phase transition has a 1d nature .",
    "our result is also another proof for the universal topological phase of the cc model and the tc model .",
    "we emphasize that our proof has a recent and important point where generally shows how the universal topological phase of two 2d topological models can be revealed even in presence of a quantum phase transition .",
    "+ to deriving results , we define a specific version of the tc model on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "we show that a model hamiltonian as interpolation of the cc and the tc model is mapped to many copies of 1d ising models in transverse field which belong to the 2d classical ising universality class .",
    "the mapping is based on re - writing the hamiltonian of the model in a new complete basis .",
    "our method is equivalent with unitary transformation on the hamiltonian which does not change spectrum of the model .",
    "we also study the behavior of wilson loops and explicitly show that the expectation value of the wilson loops in our model captures the non - topological nature of the phase transition .",
    "+ from another point of view , we find the point of the phase transition of our model which is the same as 1d ising model in transverse field at @xmath2 @xcite where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the couplings of the tc and the cc models , respectively .",
    "it shows when we add the tc hamiltonian as a small perturbation against the cc model , such a perturbation can not ever change the quantum phase of the cc model .",
    "the quantum phase transition occurs only when a considerable perturbation @xmath5 is applied .",
    "such a result show that unlike the small robustness of the cc model against local perturbations such as magnetic field or ising interaction @xcite , it is strongly robust against a topological perturbation like the tc model . +",
    "in section ( [ se1 ] ) , we review different properties of the topological phases of the tc and the cc model . in section ( [ se3 ] ) , we present our model as a interpolation of the cc and the tc model . we define both topological models on a hexagonal lattice and qualitatively show how a quantum phase transition happens . in section ( [ se4 ] ) , we use a mathematical method to map our model to 1d ising models in transverse field which have a well - known phase transition point .",
    "finally , in section ( [ se5 ] ) we consider the behavior of wilson loop operators by a perturbative approach to show the quantum phase transition in our model has not a topological nature .",
    "in this section we review the topological structure of the tc and the cc models .",
    "we specifically emphasize on different topological degeneracies and different topological structures of them by representation of the ground states as a loop - condensate states . for more details , there is also a comparative study of these models which has done in @xcite .",
    "+      a tc model is ordinarily defined as the ground state of a model hamiltonian on an oriented graph where qubits live on edges of the graph .",
    "two commutative operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 are defined corresponding to each plaquette and vertex of the graph in the following form , see figure ( [ toric ] , left ) for a square lattice :     ( @xmath8 ) operator on each qubit . by applying a sequence of @xmath9 ( @xmath8 ) operators on qubits it is possible to move a charge ( flux ) anyon on the lattice.,width=377,height=170 ]",
    "@xmath10    where @xmath11 refers to qubits around of a plaquette and @xmath12 refers to qubits around of a vertex and @xmath13 are the pauli operators .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is as summation of these operators on all plaquettes and vertices of the graph as the following form : @xmath14 by the fact that the vertex and plaquette operators commute with each other , it is simple to show the following state is a ground state of hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) : @xmath15 where the state @xmath16 is eigenstate of the operator @xmath8 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath17 and we ignore the normalization factor for this state . + there is also a simple representation for the state ( [ e2 ] ) which helps for better understanding of the topological order of such a state . to this end , let us span the product of operators @xmath18 on all plaquettes in the relation ( [ e2 ] ) as the following : @xmath19 where the right hand of this relation is the summation of all possible products of the plaquette operators . since each plaquette operator can be interpreted as a loop operator on the lattice , right hand of the relation ( [ e3 ] )",
    "is the summation of all possible loop operators .",
    "+ finally , since @xmath20 where the state @xmath21 is the eigenstate of the operator @xmath8 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath22 , the ground state of the tc model ( [ e2 ] ) can be interpreted as uniform superposition of all loop constructions of qubits @xmath23 in the sea of qubits @xmath24 which is called the loop condensation .",
    "+ such a state has a topological order which leads to a robust degeneracy in the ground state of the model when we define the model hamiltonian on a torus .",
    "in fact , on a torus topology , there are also non - contractible loop operators in the form of : @xmath25 where @xmath26 refers to the qubits which live on a non - contractible loop around the torus in two different directions @xmath27 , see figure ( [ toric ] , left ) .",
    "therefore , four the following quantum states are the degenerate ground states of hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) : @xmath28 where the indices @xmath29 refer to four different quantum states . + topological order of the tc model are understood by three important properties , robust degeneracy , non - local order parameter and anyonic excitations . + the robust degeneracy is due to this fact that four degenerate ground states ( [ e4 ] ) can not be converted to each other by any local parameter so the degeneracy is robust against each local perturbation .",
    "+ another property is that any local operator can not distinguish four degenerate ground states .",
    "in fact , there are two non - local operators which have different expectation values in different degenerate ground states .",
    "such operators are defined in the following form : @xmath30 where @xmath26 refers to the qubits which live on a non - contractible loop around the torus in two different directions @xmath27 , see figure ( [ toric ] , left ) .",
    "the expectation values of these operators in each one of the four degenerate ground states are as follows : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 therefore these two non - local operators can distinguish the different ground states .",
    "+ finally , excitations of the tc model are quasi - particles with anyonic statistics .",
    "an excitation is generated by applying the pauli operators @xmath8 or @xmath9 on a qubit of the lattice , see figure([toric ] , right ) .",
    "an operator @xmath8 on a qubit does not commute with two plaquette operators which are shared in that qubit and it is interpreted as two flux anyons @xmath35 in two corresponded plaquettes .",
    "also an operator @xmath9 does not commute with two neighbor vertex operators and it is interpreted as two charge anyons @xmath36 in two corresponded vertices . by applying a string of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) operators , a flux ( charge ) anyon moves on plaquettes ( vertices ) of the lattice , see figure ( [ toric ] , right ) .",
    "it is simple to show that if a charge anyon winds around a flux anyon , it leads to a minus sign on wave function .",
    "such a factor shows that charge and flux anyons are not fermions or bosons .",
    "the cc model is another well - known kind of the topological lattice models with @xmath37 topological order .",
    "although topological properties of this model seems similar to the tc , additional freedom degree of color in this model leads to some important differences with the tc .",
    "specifically the cc is more efficient than the tc for computational tasks . for examples in the cc on an hexagonal lattice",
    ", all the clifford operators can be applied in a topological way while it is not possible in the tc model @xcite .",
    "+ the cc model can be defined on three - colorable lattices which technically called ` colexes ' and can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions @xcite . as an example we consider a hexagonal lattice where qubits live on vertices of the lattice , see figure ( [ hex ] ) . corresponding to each hexagonal plaquette of the lattice which",
    "is denoted by symbol `` h '' , we define two operators in the following form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 refers to all qubits belonging to the plaquette @xmath40 . the hamiltonian of the model is defined as @xmath41 since all plaquette operators commute with each other , the ground state of this hamiltonian is in the following simple form : @xmath42 ) . to this end , let us span product of operators @xmath43 in the relation ( [ c1 ] ) as the following form : @xmath44     and @xmath45 are attached to each hexagonal plaquette .",

    "+ right : corresponding to each hexagonal plaquette of the lattice , there is a triangular plaquette where two qubits live on each edge . in this way",
    ", there are three triangular lattices with three different colors .",

    "each hexagonal plaquette of the hexagonal lattice can also be considered as a triangle plaquette of a triangular lattice where two qubits of each hexagonal plaquette live on each edge of this triangular plaquette , see figure ( [ hex ] , right ) . in this way ,",
    "the edges of the lattice insert in three categories corresponding to each color and we can draw a triangular lattice corresponding to each category of colored edges , see figure([hex ] , right ) .",
    "+ finally , we interpret each plaquette operator of the cc model by a triangular colored loop on one of the three triangular lattices .",
    "by such a interpretation , the summation in the relation ( [ c2 ] ) is regarded as superposition of all possible loop operators with three different colors on the triangular lattices . a closer look to",
    "the hexagonal lattice shows that a plaquette of the initial hexagonal lattice corresponds to two different triangles of two different colored triangular lattices , see figure ( [ hex ] , right ) .",
    "therefore , we have this freedom to select one of the colors for each hexagonal plaquette . by such a freedom ,",
    "it is simple to show that the relation ( [ c2 ] ) can be interpreted as superposition of all loop operators with only two different colors .",
    "therefore , it is well understood that the topological order in the cc is similar to the tc with additional freedom degree of color .",
    "such a order is called @xmath1 topological order versus the @xmath0 topological order for the tc .",
    "+ the topological order in the cc also leads to some important properties similar to the tc such as robust degeneracy , non - local order parameter and anyonic excitations . as a sample ,",
    "if we insert the hexagonal lattice on a torus , there will be many non - contractible loop operators which lead to degeneracy of the ground states .",
    "these loop operators are defined similar to the tc model with a difference that there are three kinds of loop operators corresponding to each color , see figure ( [ hex ] , left ) , in the following form : @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 refers to the qubits which live on a non - contractible loop around the torus on a red ( green , blue ) triangular lattice in two different directions @xmath27 .",
    "since three above operators are not independent so that the product of them as @xmath50 is equal to a product of plaquette operators , we can generate the sixteen degenerate ground states of the model by applying only two colored loop operators as the following form : @xmath51 where the indices @xmath52",
    "refer to sixteen ground states of the model .",
    "similar to tc model , there are also four non - local order parameters as the following form which can characterize different ground states of the cc model , see figure ( [ hex ] , left ) .",
    "@xmath53 @xmath54 where we apply operators @xmath8 on non - contractible loops with two different colors .",
    "in this section , we consider both the tc and the cc model on the same lattice and define a new hamiltonian as the following form : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are hamiltonians of the tc and the cc model , respectively .",
    "such a hamiltonian is defined on the qubits which live on the vertices of a hexagonal lattice .",
    "+ definition of the cc on such a lattice is the same as we explained in the previous section .",
    "since qubits live on the vertices of this lattice we can not define an ordinary tc model on such a lattice .",
    "however , there is a simple way to present a tc model on such lattice . to this end",
    ", we divide each hexagonal plaquette to two trapezoid - shaped parts as it is shown in figure([c - t ] ) .",
    "then we paint all trapezoids as chess - pattern with dark and light colors . in this way",
    ", we can use a rotated version of the kitaev model @xcite where we relate an operator @xmath58 to each light plaquette and an operator @xmath59 to each dark plaquette , see figure([c - t ] ) .",
    "it is very simple to show that such a model is exactly the same tc model .",
    "specifically , one can check that the ground state of this model is : @xmath60     are related to light plaquettes and the operators @xmath7 are related to dark plaquettes .",
    "two non - contractible loops which are topologically different in the cc model convert together with product of operators @xmath7 or @xmath6 which are involved by the non - contractible loops .",
    "it show that non - contractible loops with different colors are topologically the same in the tc model . , width=377,height=188 ]    such a state is the same as equation ( [ e2 ] ) in the definition of the tc model . +",
    "after definition of the tc and the cc model on the same hexagonal lattice , we are ready to study the properties of the hamiltonian ( [ in1 ] ) . on the one hand",
    ", in limit of @xmath61 , we have a tc model which have a four - fold degeneracy . on the other hand , in limit of @xmath62",
    ", we have a cc model which have a sixteen - fold degeneracy .",
    "hence , by tuning of the coupling @xmath3 from zero to infinity we expect to see a quantum phase transition .",
    "+ since non - contractible loop operators generate degeneracy in the cc and the tc models , it is useful to consider how the subspace of the ground states in the cc model changes by adding the tc model . to this end , consider non - trivial loop operators in the tc and the cc on the hexagonal lattice . as it is shown in figure([c - t ] ) , we consider four non - trivial loop operators @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the cc model and two non - trivial loop operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the tc model .",
    "it is possible to describe sixteen - fold degenerate subspace of the cc by the projectors which are constructed by non - trivial loop operators as the following form : @xmath69 where @xmath52 .",
    "let us compare above subspace with degenerate subspace of the tc model .",
    "as it is shown in figure ( [ c - t ] ) , four non - trivial operators of the cc model on the hexagonal lattice can also be considered non - trivial operators of the tc model .",
    "but there is a difference that two operators @xmath63 and @xmath65 are in the same homology class in the tc so that they convert to each other by applying product of plaquette operators @xmath7 which are involved by the two non - trivial loops .",
    "the same situation is for operators @xmath64 and @xmath66 where they convert to each other by applying product of plaquette operators @xmath6 which are involved by two non - trivial loops @xmath63 and @xmath65 . in this way , by perturbing the cc model by the tc perturbation , homology classes of the non - trivial loops change so that two non - trivial loops with different colors belong to the same homology class and a quantum phase transition occurs . + it is also interesting if we explain equivalency of non - trivial operators in the tc model in a anyonic picture .",
    "in fact in the cc model two operators @xmath64 and @xmath66 can be interpreted as generating of two charge anyons @xmath70 and @xmath71 which turn around torus and annihilate again . in the cc model , these two charge anyons are not equivalent and they can not fuse together .",
    "consequently they generate new degenerate states while in the tc model , there is only one charge anyon so that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are equivalent and they can fuse together .",
    "+ such an interpretation of the quantum phase transition emphasizes on the role of color in the cc model so that we can claim that the cc model is topologically equivalent with two tc models with two different colors .",
    "this result is explicitly derived in @xcite where authors showed that the cc model is local equivalent with two copies of the tc model . in the next section ,",
    "we show this result by explicit analysis of the quantum phase transition where we show the quantum phase transition has not a topological nature . as another point , it is also useful to emphasize on the role of different gauge symmetries of the tc and the cc model in the quantum phase transition .",
    "in fact , the tc is related to the universality class of the 2d ising model ( classical ) with @xmath0 symmetry , while the cc is related to the universality class of the 2d three - body ising model with @xmath37 symmetry @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that such a quantum phase transition can be characterized as a symmetry breaking process and has not a topological nature . +",
    "as it was explained in the previous section , according to @xcite , because of equivalency of a cc model with two copies of tc model , both models have a universal topological phase . in this section ,",
    "we want to consider properties of the phase transition between the cc and the tc model to understand how the universal topological phase of them reveals in the point of quantum phase transition .",
    "we rewrite hamiltonian eq.([in1 ] ) in a new basis and show that it converts to many copies of 1d ising model in transverse field which belongs to 2d ising universality class .",
    "finally , we conclude that the universal topological phase of those models reflects in 1d nature of the phase transition .",
    "+ consider a set of quantum states as the following form : @xmath72 is the ground state of the cc model .",
    "using @xmath73 in above defenition is necessary to find the effect of operators of the cc model on the state ( [ s1 ] ) .",

    "consequently , the operator @xmath7 also plays role of the pauli operator @xmath91 on a virtual spin corresponding to dark plaquette @xmath92 .",

    "if @xmath126 we will have an ising model on all rows of the lattice and the ground state will be as product of @xmath128 or @xmath129 for each row of the lattice . in the following",
    "we briefly explain how one of the ground states of tc model converts to four ground states of the cc model in effect of the quantum phase transition .",
    "+ consider a state @xmath130 on one of the virtual spins in the light or dark plaquette @xmath131 .",
    "the state @xmath132 in the word of the basis ( [ s2 ] ) is equal to : @xmath133 where @xmath134 refers to all plaquettes expect of the plaquette @xmath131 . on the other hand ,",
    "the state @xmath135 in the word of the basis ( [ s2 ] ) is equal to : @xmath136 in this way , the state @xmath137 will be equal to : @xmath138 therefore , it is simple to show that a state as @xmath128 on whole virtual spins in the lattice which is one of the ground states of the model is equal to : @xmath139 . by attention to relations ( [ w1 ] ) and ( [ w2 ] ) such a state in the basis ( [ s2 ] ) is equal to : @xmath140 this relation shows that if we change a row of the virtual spins on light plaquettes from @xmath141 to @xmath142 it is equal to applying a row of corresponded operators @xmath6 on the state @xmath143 in ( [ w3 ] ) . as it is shown in figure ( [ c - t ] ) , a product of operators @xmath6 on a row of the lattice is equal to product of non - trivial operators @xmath64 and @xmath66 in the cc model . while @xmath64 and @xmath66 are topologically equivalent in the tc model , they are different in the cc model .",
    "therefore , one can easily show that such a operation generates another ground state of the cc model .",
    "+ the same process occurs for the product of @xmath7 on a row of the lattice where it is equal to product of non - trivial operators @xmath63 and @xmath65 in the cc model and generates third ground state .",
    "finally , forth ground state of the cc model is generated by applying a product of @xmath7 and @xmath6 on a row of dark and light plaquttes of the lattice .",
    "therefore , one of the ground states of the tc model splits to four quantum states of the cc model in effect of the quantum phase transition .",
    "+ in this way , we showed that the quantum phase transition between the cc and the tc model is equivalent with the phase transition in 1d ising model in transverse field .",
    "such a result is important in the view point of universal topological phase for the cc and the tc model .",
    "it is well - known that a 1d quantum model has not a topological order @xcite .",
    "in fact for a 1d model , one can not define any topological signature such as wilson loop or topological entanglement entropy .",
    "consequently , our result shows that topological difference of the cc and the tc model has a 1d nature and therefore they are in the same topological phase .",
    "+ the point of phase transition at @xmath125 also shows that the cc model is strongly robust against the tc model .",
    "in fact a tc model with a small coupling @xmath144 can not lead to a quantum phase transition .",
    "while the robustness of the cc against local perturbations such as magnetic field and ising interactions is small @xcite , our result needs to a proper interpretation .",
    "it seems that since the topological phase of the tc model is the same as the cc model , the quantum phase transition in our model only relates to lifting degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "therefore , much robustness of the cc model against the tc model relates to the much robustness of the topological degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "+ in the next subsection",
    "we approximately study the behavior of wilson loop in our model .",
    "we show that the wilson loop does not behave as expected in a topological phase .",
    "in this section , we consider behavior of the wilson loop operators in our model .",
    "it is well - known that behavior of a wilson loop in a perturbed topological phase is as @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the perimeter of the wilson loop .",
    "such a behavior for the wilson loop is a signature of the topological phase @xcite . + we consider a wilson loop operator in the tc model as @xmath147 where @xmath148 is a loop on the chess - patterned hexagonal lattice , see figure ( [ wilson ] ) . such a operator is equal to product of operators @xmath6 which are involved by the wilson loop .",
    "one the one hand , it is clear that the expectation value of such an operator is equal to 1 in the ground state of the tc model . on the other hand , the expectation value of this wilson loop is equal to zero in the ground state of the cc model .",
    "therefore , the expectation value of the wilson loop changes from 1 to 0 when we increase coupling of the cc model from zero to infinity . +     which is denoted by red circles .",
    "the wilson loop operators commute with all hexagonal plaquette operators except of the operators which are near of two left and right edges of the wilson loop and are denoted by celtic cross . , width=226,height=226 ]    consider the case that @xmath149 , the ground state of our model in such a limit can be found by a perturbation method . to this end",
    "we write a perturbed quantum state as the following form : @xmath150 is the hamiltonian of the cc model and @xmath151 is the normalized ground state of the pure tc model . in the next step",
    "we have to calculate the expectation value of the wilson loop operator into the above state as @xmath152 .",
    "we approximate the ground state ( ( [ ap1 ] ) in first order of @xmath153 as the following form : @xmath154 , we will have : @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the number of hexagonal plaquettes of the lattice . on the other hand , by the fact that @xmath157 we will have : @xmath158 one can easily check that the wilson loop operator @xmath159 commute with all hexagonal plaquettes operators @xmath107 and @xmath45 except of operators @xmath107 which cross two right and left edges of the wilson loop , see figure ( [ wilson ] ) . by this and",
    "the fact that @xmath157 , we conclude that : @xmath160 where @xmath161 refers to the hexagonal operators which commute with the wilson loop and @xmath162 refers to hexagonal operators which cross two right and left edges of the wilson loop .",
    "if we denote the length of two left and right edges of the wilson loop by @xmath163 , we will have : @xmath164 @xmath165 finally the expectation value of the wilson loop operators is calculated as : @xmath166 @xmath167 since @xmath163 is the length of only two edges of the wilson loop , the result shows that the expectation value of the wilson loop does not behave as @xmath168 that we expect for a topological phase .",
    "in fact all wilson loops with different perimeters but the same @xmath163 close to zero with a similar rate by the cc perturbation .",
    "such a behavior shows that in effect of quantum phase transition from the tc to the cc models the topological phase does not change .",
    "understanding how quantum phase transitions between different quantum models can characterize different topological classes seems a challenging task which needs to more exploration in future . in this paper , by a specific example , we considered how topological classes of different quantum phases reflect in the properties of a quantum phase transition between them . to this end , we considered a quantum phase transition between two well - known topological models , the cc and the tc model .",
    "we showed that a interpolation of the cc model and the tc model is mapped to 1d quantum ising model in a transverse field .",
    "the 1d nature of the phase transition revealed the same topological nature of the cc model and the tc model .",
    "in fact , since different quantum phases of both models was related to their different gauge symmetries , it made the possible interpolating line joining them a non - topological flow . to be more explicit",
    ", we also calculated the expectation value of the wilson loop .",
    "the result showed that behavior of the wilson loop captures the same topological phase of the cc and the tc models .",
    "finally , since 1d ising model in transverse field is a well - known model with an exact solution , we could excactly find the point of the phase transition .",
    "the result showed that the cc model is strongly robust against the tc model .",
