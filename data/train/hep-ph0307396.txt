    "recently , a number of laboratories have announced observation of a strangeness @xmath0 baryon  @xcite with a mass of 1540 mev and a narrow decay width .",
    "such a state can not be a 3-quark baryon made from known quarks , and it is natural to interpret it as a pentaquark state , that is , as a state made from four quarks and one antiquark , @xmath1 .",
    "the current example of the strangeness @xmath2 baryon is positively charged and is called @xmath3 in the particle data tables and @xmath4 in some recent works  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 of necessity has an @xmath5 and four non - strange quarks .",
    "the parity , spin , and isospin of the experimental state are currently unmeasured .    in this paper , we study consequences of describing the @xmath3 within the context of conventional constituent quarks models , in more focused detail than was done in earlier work  @xcite and with new results . in these models ,",
    "all quarks are in the same spatial wave function , and spin dependent mass splittings come from either color - spin or flavor - spin exchange .",
    "the @xmath3 made this way has negative parity .",
    "we treat it as a flavor antidecuplet , with spin-1/2 because this state has , at least by elementary estimates , the lowest mass by a few hundred mev among the @xmath3 s that can be made with all quarks in the ground spatial state .",
    "the pentaquark by now has some history of theoretical study . in the context of constituent quark models",
    ", it was analyzed relatively early on  @xcite , but the subject was not pursued , probably for lack of experimental motivation .",
    "( the first of  @xcite gives a simple estimate of the @xmath3 mass of 1615 mev and then states `` there definitely is no @xmath6 state at such a low mass . '' ) much of the effort shifted to studying pentaquarks involving charmed as well as strange quarks  @xcite , before the recent flurry of theoretical attention  @xcite .",
    "pentaquarks have also been studied in the context of the skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "@xcite in particular makes a striking prediction , based on the assumption that the @xmath3 is a member of a flavor antidecuplet and that the nucleon - like members of this decuplet are the observed @xmath7 states , that the @xmath3 would have a mass of about 1530 mev and a width less than 15 mev .",
    "note that in this case the @xmath3 is a positive parity state .",
    "we may elaborate on the @xmath3 states and masses in quark models briefly before proceeding . in outline",
    ", there are several ways to make a @xmath3 , and one can obtain @xmath3 s which are isospin 0 , 1 , or 2 .",
    "the mass splittings between the states can be estimated using , say , the color - spin interactions described in more detail in the next section . techniques and useful information may be found in  @xcite .",
    "the lightest @xmath3 state is the isosinglet ( in the @xmath8 ) with spin-1/2 .",
    "the isosinglet spin-3/2 is a few hundred mev heavier .",
    "the heaviest states are the isotensor spin-1/2 and ( somewhat lighter ) spin-3/2 states .",
    "the mass gap between the lightest and heaviest of the @xmath3 s is triple the mass gap between the nucleon and the @xmath9 , if one does not account for changes in the quarks s spatial wave functions ( _ e.g. _ , due to changes in the bag radius ) , or the better part of a gev . the isovector masses lie in between the two limits .",
    "these statements are considered in quantitative detail in ref .",
    "@xcite    in the next section , we will discuss the color - flavor - spin wave functions of the antidecuplet that contains the @xmath3 .",
    "this is a necessary prelude to a discussion of the mass splittings and decays of the full decuplet , which follows in section iii .",
    "one intriguing result is the roughly equal mass spacing of the antidecuplet , with the @xmath3 lightest .",
    "normally one expects the strange state to be heavier that the non - strange one .",
    "the explanation of this counterintuitive behavior is hidden strangeness , that is , there is a fairly high probability of finding an @xmath10 pair in the non - strange state .",
    "we also show that there is a markedly different pattern of kinematically allowed decays , depending of whether spin - isospin or spin - color exchange interactions are relevant in determining the mass spectrum .",
    "we close in section iv with some discussion .",
    "there are two useful ways to compose the pentaquark state .",
    "one is to build the @xmath11 state from two pairs of quarks and then combine with the @xmath12 .",
    "the other is to combine a @xmath13 state with a @xmath14 to form the pentaquark .",
    "we first represent the pentaquark state in terms of states labelled by the quantum numbers of the first and second quark pairs . since the antiquark is always in a ( @xmath15,@xmath16,@xmath17 ) ( color , flavor , spin ) state , we know immediately that the remaining four - quark ( @xmath11 ) state must be a color @xmath18",
    ". the flavor of a generic @xmath11 state can be either a @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to symmetry and mixed symmetry under quark interchange , respectively ) .",
    "however , only the @xmath19 can combine with the @xmath16 antiquark to yield an antidecuplet .",
    "finally , the spin of the @xmath11 state can be either @xmath24 or @xmath25 if the total spin of the state is @xmath17 .",
    "however , it is not difficult to show that any state constructed with the correct quantum numbers using the spin - zero @xmath11 wave function will be antisymmetric under the combined interchange of the two quarks in the first pair with the two quarks in second pair ; this is inconsistent with the requirement that the four - quark state be totally antisymmetric . thus we are led to the unique choice @xmath26 figure  [ fig : yt ] shows the possible quark pair combinations that can provide a @xmath27 four - quark state .",
    "the symmetry under interchange of quarks @xmath25 and @xmath28 , or @xmath29 and @xmath30 is immediate from each of the young s tableau shown .",
    "the symmetry under interchange of the first and second quark pairs is indicated in brackets next to the tableau .",
    "only three combinations have the right symmetry under quark interchange to form a totally antisymmetric @xmath11 state , namely @xmath31@xmath32 the requirement of total antisymmetry of the @xmath11 wave function , determines the relative coefficients .",
    "we find that the properly normalized state is given by @xmath33    3.5 in    where we have suppressed the quantum numbers of the antiquark , ( @xmath15,@xmath16,@xmath17 ) , which are the same in each term .",
    "also tacit on the right - hand side is that each @xmath11 state is combined to @xmath34 .",
    "the signs shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq:221 ] ) depend on sign conventions for the states on the right - hand side . for the @xmath3 component , spin @xmath35",
    ", we find @xmath36 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times&[\\{\\uparrow\\uparrow(\\uparrow\\downarrow+\\downarrow\\uparrow ) - ( \\uparrow\\downarrow+\\downarrow\\uparrow)\\uparrow\\uparrow\\}\\downarrow -(\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\downarrow - \\downarrow\\downarrow\\uparrow\\uparrow)\\uparrow ] \\,\\,\\ , , \\label{eq:361}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath37 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times&[(\\uparrow\\downarrow-\\downarrow\\uparrow)\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow -\\frac{1}{2}(\\uparrow\\downarrow-\\downarrow\\uparrow)(\\uparrow\\downarrow   + \\downarrow\\uparrow)\\uparrow ] \\,\\,\\",

    "\\label{eq : mixed2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have written the color wave function in tensor notation for compactness , with @xmath39 . the remaining component states in eq .",
    "( [ eq:221 ] ) can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mixed1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mixed2 ] ) by exchanging the first and second pair of quarks . with these results ,",
    "one may construct other antidecuplet wave functions by application of su(3 ) and isospin raising and lowering operators .",
    "it is often convenient for calculational purposes to have a decomposition of the pentaquark wave function in terms of the quantum numbers of the first three quarks , and of the remaining quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the quark - antiquark pair can be either in a @xmath40 or @xmath41 of color , which implies that we must have the same representations for the three - quark ( @xmath13 ) system , in order that a singlet may be formed .",
    "as for flavor , the @xmath13 and @xmath42 systems must both be in @xmath43 s : the @xmath42 pair can not be in a flavor singlet , since there is no way to construct a @xmath44 from the remaining three quarks , and the @xmath13 state must be an @xmath41 since the remaining possibilities ( @xmath40 and @xmath45 ) do not yield an antidecuplet when combined with the @xmath46 flavor octet .",
    "finally , the @xmath47 spin can be either @xmath24 or @xmath25 , which implies that the @xmath13 spin can be either @xmath17 or @xmath48 .",
    "the states consistent with @xmath13 antisymmetry are then    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the skyrme model also has predictions  @xcite for the masses and decays of the antidecuplet .",
    "the mass splittings there were about 180 mev between each level of the decuplet ( with the @xmath3 still the lightest ) , considerably larger splittings than we find in a constituent quark model where the mass splittings come from strange quark masses and from color - spin interactions .",
    "mass splittings using isospin - spin interactions were , on the other hand , more comparable to the skyrme model results .",
    "decays of the antidecuplet into a ground state octet baryon and an octet meson involve a decay matrix element and phase space . ratios of decay matrix elements for pure antidecuplets , such as we show in table i , are fixed by @xmath49 symmetry .",
    "they are the same in any model , as may be confirmed by comparing table i to results in  @xcite .",
    "we have neglected mixing ; ref .",
    "@xcite does consider mixing but does not find large consequences for the decays .",
    "the differences between relative decay predictions are then due to differences in phase space , and the differences are due to masses and due to parity .",
    "negative parity states decaying to ground state baryon and pseudoscalar meson have s - wave phase space , while positive parity states have p - wave phase space .",
    "note also that @xmath49 symmetry does not allow decays of antidecuplets into decuplet baryons plus octet mesons .",
    "in this letter we have shown how to construct the quark model wave functions for members of the pentaquark antidecuplet , the flavor multiplet that we argue is most likely to contain the strangeness one state recently observed in a number of experiments  @xcite .",
    "we present two decompositions of the @xmath44 wave function that are useful for computing spin - flavor - color matrix elements , and that reveal the hidden strangeness in each component state .",
    "in addition , we have presented the @xmath3 wave function in explicit form .",
    "we use these results to estimate the effect of spin - color and spin - isospin interactions on the pentaquark mass spectrum . in the first case",
    ", we use the mit bag as a representative constituent quark model to compute the equal spacing between antidecuplet states that differ by one unit of strangeness ; we estimate a splitting of @xmath50  mev .",
    "the observed @xmath3 mass and su(3 ) symmetry then allows us to make decay predictions .",
    "notably , if only color - spin interactions are present , decays of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 to final states in which both decay products have nonzero strangeness are kinematically forbidden .",
    "in addition , the @xmath53 states are narrower than those in ref .",
    "@xcite , so that experimental detection might be possible and dramatic . if instead , spin - isospin interactions dominate , all the decays in table  [ decaytable ] become kinematically accessible .",
    "the work summarized here sets the groundwork for further investigation .",
    "of particular interest to us is the relation between bag model predictions for the absolute pentaquark mass ( rather than the mass splittings considered here ) and the mass of other multiquark exotic states .",
    "the conventional mit bag predicts a @xmath3 mass that is too large relative to the experimental value ( we find that a prediction of about @xmath54  mev is typical ) ; however , these numbers can be easily reconciled by allowing bag model parameters to float  @xcite . an appropriate analysis requires a simultaneous fit to pentaquark and low - lying non - exotic hadron masses , and consideration of center - of - mass corrections .",
    "whether such fits simultaneously allow for sufficiently heavy six - quark states , given a choice of constituent interactions , is an open question .",
    "our analysis also gives insight into other pentaquark states .",
    "for example , there are nucleon - like states in the pentaquark octet ( states in the same spin - color representation as the @xmath3 ) which are potentially light .",
    "however , we find that these states also have hidden strangeness , placing them within one - third of the strange quark mass below the @xmath3 , if no other effects are considered , and at or above the @xmath3 mass if spin - isospin interactions are taken into account .",
    "this is one example of the value of extending our present analysis to other pentaquark multiplets . a more detailed discussion of these topics , as well as of the group theoretical issues described here will be presented in a longer publication  @xcite .",
