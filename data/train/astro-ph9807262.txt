    "the study of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been revolutionized by the discovery of extremely well - localized x - ray , optical and radio transients ( costa et al 1997 , van paradijs et al 1997 , frail et al 1997 ) .",
    "follow - up of the optical transients ( ots ) has shown that grbs come from cosmological distances ( metzger et al 1997b ) .",
    "one notable early result of this follow - up is that the ot host galaxies have generally been near twenty - fifth magnitude in the visible , for those cases in which a host galaxy has been detected ( which is the majority with ots ; references in table  [ tab : thelist ] ) .",
    "five of these host galaxies now have redshifts @xmath2 ( metzger et al 1997a , djorgovski et al 1998e , djorgovski et al 1999 , kulkarni et al 1998 , bloom et al 1999 ) .",
    "the question considered here is : _ how do the flux and redshift distributions of the grb hosts compare with the predictions of simple models ? _    it has been surprising to many that bright grbs , which have a `` euclidean '' number - flux relation suggesting that they are local , are not correlated on the sky with local , bright galaxies ( schaefer 1998 , band & hartmann 1998 ) .",
    "this lack of association has been termed the `` no - host problem . ''",
    "although authors in the no - host literature have generally assumed that the grb luminosity function is narrow , the lack of correlation at the bright end has suggested , even prior to the recent redshift determinations , that the typical grb intrinsic energies are very great .",
    "the approach taken here is complementary ; it is to compute several different host galaxy flux probability distribution functions under the simplest possible assumptions about grb probability as a function of host galaxy luminosity and redshift , and detectability as a function of redshift .",
    "the distribution functions are compared with the observations of grb hosts .",
    "unfortunately , the association of each grb with its host requires several steps : the burst is first localized to an accuracy of half to several arcminutes by an x - ray camera .",
    "an ot must be discovered in the x - ray error box , sometimes with the help of a prior radio detection .",
    "finally , the ot must decay sufficiently to allow a search for an underlying galaxy",
    ". it may not be coincidental that many of the hosts have @xmath3  mag , comparable to the detection limit of a few hours integration on a large telescope .",
    "it is at least possible in one or two cases that the currently associated galaxy is not the host but rather a brighter , foreground galaxy at the sky position of the ot by chance .",
    "this problem may be compounded by the arcsec seeing in ground - based telescope images . despite these caveats , for the purposes of this work",
    ", the conventionally believed associations of x - ray transients with grbs , ots with x - ray transients , and host galaxies with ots , will all be accepted with fawning credulity .",
    "as will , of course , the hypotheses that grbs are cosmological in origin , and that they are associated with normal galaxies",
    ".    table  [ tab : thelist ] lists the grbs with associated ots and the positions and extintinction - corrected magnitudes of their host galaxies .",
    "magnitudes have been corrected for extinction , and redshifts are given where known .",
    "the ot detection associated with grb 971227 is unconfirmed and its field was therefore not searched exhaustively for a host galaxy .",
    "this non - detection has little impact on the results because , as will be shown below , the limiting magnitude of the search does not put an interesting constraint on its host galaxy , even if the ot detection is good .",
    "the host galaxies of grbs 980326 and 980329 have uncertain magnitudes .",
    "the hosts may not be detected , because the light attributed to the hosts may in fact be coming partly from the ots , even in the latest images .",
    "the measured fluxes really ought to be treated as upper limits ( bloom & kulkarni 1998 , fruchter 1999 , pian , private communication ) .",
    "grb 980425 is excluded from the analysis because , as will be shown below , it is an outlier at the @xmath1 level in all reasonable models .",
    "grb 980425 must represent a distinct class of bursts .",
    "finally , the association of grb 980613 with its host galaxy is uncertain , because there is a possibility that no ot was detected at all in this case ( thorsett & metzger , private communication ) .",
    "an @xmath4 world model is adopted , except where noted , and all results are independent of the hubble constant .",
    "magnitudes are given in the @xmath5 band relative to vega , with @xmath6  mag corresponding to @xmath7  mag or @xmath8 .",
    "our procedure is to compare several fiducial models with the data and then discuss the effect of variations in these models on the comparison .",
    "the emphasis is on minimizing the total number of assumptions .    in all models ,",
    "we assume that the probability of a grb `` going off '' in a particular galaxy , at a particular epoch , is proportional to that galaxy s broad - band luminosity . in the star - formation - rate ( sfr ) models",
    ", it is assumed that the total comoving rate density ( number per unit comoving volume per unit time ) at which grbs are produced at any particular epoch is proportional to the total comoving star formation rate density @xmath9 at that epoch .",
    "a by - eye fit was performed to the @xmath9 measurements of connolly et al ( 1997 ) ; this fit is shown in the second panel of figure  [ fig : inputs ] , it has @xmath10 at redshifts @xmath11 , @xmath12 at @xmath13 , and @xmath14 at @xmath15 . in the total - stellar - density ( tsd )",
    "models , it is assumed that the comoving rate density is proportional to the total number density of stars which have been formed since the beginning of cosmic time , the integral of the star formation rate density @xmath16 . finally , in the constant per comoving volume ( ccv ) model , the comoving rate density is the same at all epochs .",
    "at least some grbs and ots can be detected to very high redshift ( kulkarni et al 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the detection function @xmath17 , or probability of grb ( and x - ray and ot ) detection as a function of redshift @xmath18 , is unknown empirically and impossible to compute theoretically because it depends not only on the sensitivities of the detectors but on the distribution of intrinsic gamma - ray , x - ray and optical properties of the bursts , along with the quality and consistency of x - ray and optical follow - up observations .",
    "although it is somewhat unconventional to pack all of the uncertainties about the multivariate gamma - ray , x - ray , and optical grb luminosity functions and detector and follow - up sensitivities into the single function @xmath19 , it greatly reduces the total number of assumptions and clarifies the model - dependence of the results .",
    "studies of the grb luminosity function which are consistent with the observed grb number counts and redshifts suggest that @xmath17 is a weak function of @xmath18 , falling by only a factor of a few from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( krumholz , thorsett & harrison 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , at least one burst with an associated ot has been associated with a redshift 3.4 host galaxy ( kulkarni et al 1998 ) , and it is plausible that grb 980329 is at @xmath22 ( fruchter 1999 ) . in any event , as discussed below , we find that the results are only significantly affected if @xmath19 is very strongly weighted towards low redshift ( corresponding to a grb or x - ray or ot luminosity function very strongly weighted towards low - energy bursts ) . for the purposes of the fiducial models it is simply assumed that @xmath23 over the redshift range @xmath24 and @xmath25 at @xmath26 , as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : inputs ] .",
    "the function @xmath19 varies slowly out to @xmath27 because the gamma - ray bursts are not assumed to be standard candles ; this analysis allows the luminosity function to be very wide without in fact specifying its width or shape . at @xmath26 @xmath19 vanishes because lyman limit absorption will obscure ots and host galaxies in the @xmath5 band .",
    "as will be seen below , the results do not depend very strongly on the assumed form of @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that all observations of hosts are performed in the r band .",
    "thus the observing band in the frame of the host will vary with redshift . to maintain independence of world model ,",
    "the characteristic luminosity @xmath28 appearing in the schechter ( 1976 ) form of the luminosity function is input in the form of the apparent magnitude @xmath29 to which it corresponds at each epoch , which is the directly observed quantity . in practice ,",
    "the @xmath30 employed is equivalent to @xmath31 evolving from @xmath32 ( in @xmath33 in @xmath34 ) at @xmath35 to @xmath36 at @xmath27 in an @xmath37 universe .",
    "( this is not the default cosmology , but this form for @xmath30 is simply a parameterization of the observational determinations , with the @xmath38 world model used for consistency with pozetti et al 1998 ) .",
    "this form of @xmath30 is shown in figure  [ fig : inputs ] and is consistent with all measures of luminosity function evolution to @xmath39 ( lilly et al 1995 , ellis et al 1996 , hogg 1998 ) and at @xmath15 ( pozzetti et al 1998 ) . as shown in figure  [ fig : inputs ] , the faint - end slope parameter @xmath40 is chosen to be flat ( @xmath41 ) in the local universe ( eg , loveday et al 1992 , lilly et al 1995 , ellis et al 1996 , hogg 1998 ) and slightly steeper ( @xmath42 ) at high redshifts @xmath43 ( pozzetti et al 1998 ) and steeper still ( @xmath44 ) in between at redshifts @xmath45 .",
    "this @xmath44 epoch is required to make the steep number counts , which show @xmath46 in the @xmath5 band at the faint end ( hogg et al 1997 ) , and in the redshift interval @xmath45 there are not yet strong direct constraints on this slope ( lilly et al 1995 , ellis et al 1996 , hogg 1998 ) , so this @xmath40 model , shown in figure  [ fig : inputs ] , is consistent with all observations .",
    "this model is only arbitrary in the choice of redshift interval for the @xmath44 epoch ; some such epoch is required in all natural models of the faint galaxy counts .    in the sfr models ,",
    "the grb probability will not be strictly proportional to a galaxy s broad - band luminosity but rather to its star formation rate . at high redshift ,",
    "the observed visual luminosity is a very good measure of star formation rate , because observed visual is emitted in the rest - frame ultraviolet .",
    "this is less true in the local universe where star formation is at least somewhat weighted towards lower - luminosity galaxies ( small et al 1997 ) .",
    "this effect is not strong and therefore does not greatly affect the results but means that the number of bright ( @xmath47 ) hosts predicted by this procedure may be slightly higher than in a more accurate representation of the sfr model .",
    "the host galaxy flux and redshift distribution predictions of the fiducial models are shown in figure  [ fig : fluxdist ] , along with the observed host galaxy magnitudes and redshifts .",
    "the models are compared with relative likelihoods @xmath48 of obtaining the observed host galaxy magnitudes given the model .",
    "the likelihoods are computed by multiplying together the differential probability @xmath49 ( probability per unit magnitude ) evaluated at each observed host magnitude value , and the integral of @xmath50 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 for the magnitude limits on grbs 971227 , 980326 and 980329 .",
    "unfortunately , likelihoods are only relative , not absolute .",
    "the relative likelihoods for the fiducial sfr , tsd , ccv models are @xmath53 .",
    "although clearly all three models are consistent with the observed host - galaxy magnitude distribution , both the likelihoods and the appearence of figure  [ fig : fluxdist ] suggests that the tsd model is slightly disfavored relative to sfr and ccv .",
    "the likelihood test is not applied to the redshift distribution because there is great uncertainty in the redshift identification probability as a function of magnitude and redshift , which may dominate the shape of the observed redshift distribution . however , under the assumptions about redshift identification probability with which figure  [ fig : fluxdist ] was made , it appears that the host - galaxy redshift distribution also slightly disfavors the tsd model .    in all three models ,",
    "the probability of finding a @xmath0 grb among a sample of 11 grbs is less than @xmath1 , strongly suggesting that grb 980425 , if associated with supernova 1998bw , represents a distinct class of grbs , and justifying its exclusion from the analysis .",
    "it is worthy of note that this argument for a second class of grbs makes no reference to the intrinsic energetics of grb 980425 and is therefore qualitatively different from previous arguments ( kulkarni et al 1998b ) .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : fluxdist ] that even with much larger number of grb host observations it will be very difficult to distinguish the sfr from the ccv using the magnitude or redshift distributions .",
    "previous claims to the contrary ( totani 1998 ) are based on an unrealistic assumption that grbs are close to standard candles .",
    "the sfr and ccv models make very similar predictions because the comoving rate densities only differ significantly at low redshift , where there is not much comoving volume , and at high redshift , where the time dilation @xmath54 factor which comes into rate calculations and the declining @xmath19 both effectively reduce the contribution to the total grb rate .",
    "the two hypotheses will be readily distinguishable by investigating the spectral properties of the associated hosts ; the sfr models predict bluer and more emission - line - dominated galaxies than an average sample .",
    "it does appear that the majority of grb hosts do show signs of fairly active star formation ( kulkarni et al 1998 , metzger et al 1997a , fruchter et al 1998 ) ; there may already be enough information about host galaxies to distinguish these models . another simple hypothesis which would make very similar predictions to the sfr is that the comoving rate density is proportional to the evolving number density of quasars ( eg , schmidt , schneider & gunn 1995 ) .",
    "previous no - host studies have claimed to rule out interesting grb models with limits on host galaxies in the range 13 to 23  mag ( schaefer 1998 , band & hartmann 1998 ) , but such studies do not strongly constrain the grb models presented here .",
    "there may be no contradiction , because the previous literature on the no - host problem is primarily concerned with very bright bursts , and , a narrow or standard - candle grb luminosity function usually has been assumed .",
    "the present analysis , which does not specify a grb luminosity function but allows it to be very wide , is not capable of making different predictions for the host galaxies of bursts with different observed fluences .",
    "this analysis sacrifices that capability in order to avoid making unnecessary assumptions .",
    "not surprisingly , the predictions do not depend strongly on cosmology . in an @xmath55 universe , the sfr , tsd , ccv models have likelihoods @xmath56 . in an @xmath57 universe",
    ", they have @xmath53 .",
    "unfortunately , the results do depend somewhat on the choice of @xmath58 , the least well - constrained of the model inputs . if @xmath59 is adopted , the sfr , tsd , ccv models have likelihoods @xmath60 . if @xmath61 is adopted , they have @xmath62 . weighting @xmath19 towards high redshift improves the success of the tsd model relative to the sfr and ccv models , because the tsd rate density itself is weighted towards low redshift",
    ". however , @xmath63 is clearly an unrealistic model ; it says that grbs ( and x - ray transients and ots ) are equally easy to detect at all redshifts !",
    "conversely , strong weighting of @xmath19 towards low redshift improves the success of sfr and ccv relative to tsd . even in the @xmath64 models ,",
    "the probability of finding a @xmath0 grb among this sample of 11 is still very small .",
    "there is some debate about the rise of the star formation rate density with cosmic time at high redshift , since the measurements are subject to possible incompleteness and uncertain dust extinction corrections ( eg , pettini et al 1998 ) .",
    "this uncertainty is not important here ; if the rise in the star formation rate with time at @xmath15 is replaced with a constant value equal to the value at @xmath65 ( which may more accurately represent the true situation , steidel & adelberger , private communication ) , the likelihoods for the sfr , tsd , ccv models become @xmath66 .",
    "it is worthy of note that this change makes the sfr and ccv models even more difficult to distinguish than in the fiducial case .",
    "the uncertain high - redshift faint - end slope of the galaxy luminosity function does affect the results . if it is changed to @xmath67 for all redshifts @xmath68 , which is probably still consistent with the existing @xmath69 galaxy observations ( pozzetti et al 1998 ) , the sfr , tsd , ccv models have likelihoods @xmath70 .",
    "the relative success of tsd is improved when the luminosity function is made more dwarf - rich . however , the fraction @xmath71 of hosts predicted to be at @xmath72  mag ( ie , extremely faint ) becomes large .",
    "quantitatively , as the @xmath15 value of @xmath73 ranges from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , @xmath71 for the sfr , tsd , ccv models ranges from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "if the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function really is steep at high redshift , and either the sfr or the ccv hypothesis is close to correct , it is possible that some of the current grb host galaxy identifications or photometric measurements are in error , since very few optical observations are sensitive to 28  mag .    in all these models , a large fraction of host galaxies have extremely small intrinsic luminosities .",
    "even if such galaxies are as common as the extrapolated galaxy luminosity functions suggest , they may not host grbs .",
    "for example , in neutron - star  neutron - star merger scenarios , very low - mass galaxies do not gravitationally bind kicked neutron - star binaries ( bloom , sigurdsson & pols 1998a ) . for this reason it might be sensible to implement a low - luminosity cutoff to the galaxy luminosity function . with a cutoff at @xmath78 the sfr , tsd , ccv models have likelihoods @xmath79 , and @xmath71 drops to 0.030,0.0068,0.044 .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of the results on the faint - end slope of the luminosity function at high redshift disappears almost entirely .",
    "the expected distribution of grb host galaxy fluxes and redshifts are predicted , assuming reasonable grb comoving rate density models and that at any epoch , grb probability is proportional to host galaxy luminosity .",
    "the analysis makes fewer assumptions than previous studies .",
    "in particular , it makes no assumption of a narrow grb luminosity function .",
    "the agreement between the models and the data , for reasonable choices of model parameters , is very good .",
    "of the three models considered , the tsd fares worst , although it is by no means ruled out .",
    "the sfr and ccv models make very similar predictions for the host galaxy magnitude and redshift distributions , so those two models will have to be distinguished with observations of host - galaxy star - formation rates .",
    "we do not find a classical no - host problem , in the sense of a lack of local , bright galaxy hosts , although as stated above , the present analysis does not make different predictions for bursts of different fluences .",
    "there may be some suggestion that grbs do not occur in extremely low - luminosity host galaxies , because , when no cut - off is applied to the luminosity function at low luminosity , the models predict a significant fraction of grb hosts below the detection limits of typical surveys .",
    "of course it is possible that up to three of the current hosts fall into this category in the current sample of grbs with ots .",
    "one conclusion of this work is that grb 980425 , associated with the low - redshift supernova 1998bw , must be a member of a distinct class . in all models ,",
    "the probability of finding a @xmath0 grb among a sample of 11 grbs is less than @xmath1 .",
    "it is notable that in the models presented here , many grbs and their hosts lie in the redshift range @xmath80 , where galaxies are very hard to identify with visual spectroscopy , even on large telescopes .",
    "either infrared spectroscopy or the ultraviolet capabilities of the hubble space telescope may be necessary to obtain the redshifts of these grbs .    _",
    "a note on history : the first version of this paper was submitted when all known grb host magnitudes ( except grb 980425 ) were in the range @xmath81  mag . at that time , the largest discrepancy between the observations and the models was that the width of the observed magnitude distribution was much narrower than the prediction of any model . since then , three host magnitude measurements ( 971214 , 980326 , and 980613 ) have been significantly revised ( odewahn et al 1998 , bloom & kulkarni 1998 , metzger et al private communication ) , and two new host magnitudes ( 980703 and 990123 ) have been measured ( bloom et al 1998c , fruchter et al 1999 ) , greatly improving the agreement between the models and the data .",

    "<S> the observed redshifts and magnitudes of the host galaxies of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are compared with the predictions of three basic grb models , in which the comoving rate density of grbs is ( 1 )  proportional to the cosmic star formation rate density , ( 2 )  proportional to the total integrated stellar density and ( 3 )  constant . </S>",
    "<S> all three models make the assumption that at every epoch the probability of a grb occuring in a galaxy is proportional to that galaxy s broad - band luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> no assumption is made that grbs are standard candles or even that their luminosity function is narrow . </S>",
    "<S> all three rate density models are consistent with the observed grb host galaxies to date , although model ( 2 ) is slightly disfavored relative to the others . models ( 1 ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) make very similar predictions for host galaxy magnitude and redshift distributions ; these models will be probably not be distinguished without measurements of host - galaxy star - formation rates . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of host galaxies fainter than 28  mag may constrain the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function at high redshift , or , if the fraction is observed to be low , may suggest that the bursters are expelled from low - luminosity hosts . in all models , the probability of finding a @xmath0 grb among a sample of 11 grbs is less than @xmath1 , strongly suggesting that grb 980425 , if associated with supernova 1998bw , represents a distinct class of grbs . </S>"
