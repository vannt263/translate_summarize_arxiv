    "it is well established in gauge field theories that the vacuum expectation value of a field @xmath9 can take on non - zero values when the ground state , at the minimum of the zero - temperature potential or `` true vacuum '' , breaks the symmetry of the underlying lagrangian @xcite . in the hot early universe ,",
    "thermal effects lead to an effective potential with a temperature dependence , such that the vacuum starts in a symmetric `` false '' vacuum and only later cools to its ground state below a certain critical temperature  @xcite . in general",

    "any field theory with a broken u(1 ) symmetry will have classical solutions extended in one dimension , and in cosmology these structures generically form a cosmic network of macroscopic , quasi - stable strings that steadily unravels but survives to the present day , losing energy primarily by gravitational radiation  @xcite . a dual superstring description for this physics is given in terms of one - dimensional branes , such as d - strings and f - strings  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the spectrum of background gravitational radiation from cosmologies with strings . we undertake calculations at much lower string masses than previously , with several motivations :    1 .",
    "recent advances in millisecond pulsar timing have reached new levels of precision and are providing better limits on low frequency backgrounds ; the calculations presented here provide a precise connection between the background limits and fundamental theories of strings and inflation  @xcite .",
    "2 .   the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ( lisa ) will provide much more sensitive limits over a broad band around millihertz frequencies .",
    "calculations have not previously been made for theories in this band of sensitivity and frequency , and are needed since the background spectrum depends significantly on string mass  @xcite .",
    "recent studies of string network behavior strongly suggest ( though they have not yet proven definitively ) a high rate of formation of stable string loops comparable to the size of the cosmic horizon .",
    "this results in a higher net production of gravitational waves since the loops of a given size , forming earlier , have a higher space density .",
    "the more intense background means experiments are sensitive to lower string masses  @xcite .",
    "4 .   extending the observational probes to the light string regime is an important constraint on field theories and superstring cosmology far below the planck scale .",
    "the current calculation provides a quantitative bridge between the parameters of the fundamental theory ( especially , the string tension ) , and the properties of the observable background  @xcite .",
    "the results of our study confirm the estimates made in an earlier exploratory analysis , that also gives simple scaling laws , additional context and background  @xcite .",
    "here we add a realistic concordance cosmology and detailed numerical integration of various effects .",
    "we estimate that the approximations used to derive the current results are reliable to better than about fifty percent , and are therefore useful for comparison of fundamental theory with real data over a wide range of string parameters .",
    "cosmic strings astrophysical properties are strongly dependent upon two parameters : the dimensionless string tension @xmath10 ( in planck units where @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) or @xmath13 in si units , and the interchange probability p. our main conclusion is that the current pulsar data  @xcite already place far tighter constraints on string tension than other arguments , such as microwave background anisotropy or gravitational lensing .",
    "recent observations from wmap and sdss @xcite have put the value of @xmath14 due to lack of cosmic background anisotropy or structure formation consistent with heavier cosmic strings . from @xcite it is found that up to a maximum of 7% ( at the 68% confidence level ) of the microwave anisotropy can be cosmic strings . in other words , for strings light enough to be consistent with current pulsar limits , there is no observable effect other than their gravitational waves .",

    "each loop contributes power to the background : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is generally given to be on the order of 50 to 100 @xcite .",
    "gravitational radiation from strings is characterized for our purposes by the dimensionless luminosity of gravitational waves @xmath21 , which depends on the excitation spectrum of typical radiating modes on string loops .",
    "loop formation is characterized by @xmath3 , the typical size of newly formed loops as a fraction of the hubble scale @xmath22 .",
    "estimates based on numerical simulations have in the past suggested very small values , leading to the hypothesis that @xmath23 or smaller  @xcite ; those ideas suggest that all but a fraction @xmath24 or smaller of loops shatter into tiny pieces .",
    "recent simulations designed to avoid numerical artifacts suggest a radically different picture , that in fact a significant fraction of loops land on stable non - self - intersecting orbits at a fraction @xmath25 of the horizon scale  @xcite . our study is oriented towards this view , which leads to a larger density of loops and a more intense background for a given string mass .    for units of the gravitational energy in a stochastic background a convenient measure we adopt is the conventional dimensionless quantity given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the energy density in the gravitational waves and @xmath28 is the critical density .",

    "there has been much interest in cusps and kinks as sources of gravitational radiation from cosmic strings @xcite . in this paper an estimate of the radiation power from cusps and kinks is included as higher frequency behavior in the loop gravitational wave spectrum , but the beaming and bursts of gravitational waves is not discussed explicitly . as estimated in @xcite , in the regime of very light strings , observable bursts are expected to be rare , and harder to detect than the stochastic background .",
    "finally we would like to state some additional uncertainties associated with the model of strings described below :    *   there is the possibility of multiple scales in loop formation : some string theories suggest multiple stable intersection points and loops connected by these intersections",
    ". this may strongly affect the accuracy of the one scale model , and indeed some of these theories also have significant other modes of decay that invalidate the entire framework used here  @xcite .",
    "*   the reconnection probability p can be less than one .",
    "this may affect loop formation and the gravitational wave background .",
    "in general it is thought that this effect always increases the the predicted background although it is not agreed by how much  @xcite .",
    "*   there may be transient behavior of cosmic strings due to the formation process of cosmic quenching .",
    "the model below assumes that transient effects have long since settled out by the time our model begins ; this seems likely at lisa frequencies which correspond to initial loop sizes much larger than the horizon at the end of inflation  @xcite .",
    "further numerical string network studies will be needed to resolve these issues .",
    "the behavior of strings on cosmological scales has been thoroughly discussed in the literature  @xcite . by the kibble mechanism strings",
    "are created as a random walk with small coherence length , and they evolve following the nambu - goto action .",
    "the strings form in large threadlike networks @xcite , and on scales longer than the hubble length @xmath31 the network is frozen and stretches with expansion .",
    "the strings move with speed c , and they interact to form loops with a probability p by different mechanisms : one involves two strings , the other a single string forming a loop .",
    "these loops break off from the infinite string network and become the dominant source of gravitational waves .",
    "they oscillate with a fundamental frequency given by @xmath32 , where l is the length of the loop .",
    "in general the loops form a discrete set of frequencies with higher modes given by @xmath33 .",
    "the exchange probability p measures the likelihood that two crossing string segments interact and form new connections to one another . if p=0 then the string segments simply pass through each other ; but if p=1 then they can exchange `` partners '' , possibly forming a loop .",
    "the value of p depends upon the model  @xcite ; it is close to unity in models most commonly discussed but in principle is an independent parameter ( and in a broad class of models , the only one ) that can modulate the amplitude of the spectrum for a given string tension . in this paper",
    "it is taken to be p=1 and is parameterized as part of the number of loops formed at a given time  @xcite .",
    "the number of loops is normalized to the previous results of r.r .",
    "caldwell and b. allen  @xcite , which is described in detail later in this section .      for the dynamics of a string",
    "the nambu - goto action is used : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are parameterized coordinates on the world sheet of the loop , and @xmath37 is the determinant of the induced metric on the worldsheet .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the string can be given by @xcite , @xmath38 where @xmath35 is taken along the time direction .",
    "the radiated power from a loop at a particular frequency , @xmath39 , into a solid angle @xmath40 is , @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the fourier transform of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "dimensionally the power is given by @xmath44  @xcite with numerical coefficients determined by the frequency mode and the luminosity of the loop .",
    "in general for the power output of a loop at a given mode we can write @xmath45  @xcite , where directionality is ignored by effectively inserting the loop into a large network of loops and the @xmath46 are dimensionless power coefficients .",
    "note that c has been reinserted .",
    "the power coefficients are generally given the form @xmath47 @xcite which will create an @xmath48 high frequency tail to the power spectrum of a loop .",
    "the total power from a loop is a sum of all the modes :    @xmath49    thus @xmath21 measures the output of energy and is labeled the `` dimensionless gravitational wave luminosity '' of a loop . for most calculations we use the value @xmath50  @xcite .    for the majority of our calculations we assume only the fundamental mode contributes , effectively a delta function for @xmath51 , and @xmath32 is the only emission frequency of each loop .",
    "this assumption is relatively good . to check this ,",
    "some calculations include higher frequency contributions and show that the effect on the background is small overall , with almost no difference at high frequencies .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in results .",
    "the high frequency additions also represent the contribution from kinks and cusps , which add to the high frequency region with an @xmath48 tail from each loop .",
    "this high frequency dependence is the same as that for the high frequency modes , so their contributions should be similar , particularly for light strings .",
    "light strings contribute at higher frequencies because the loops decay more slowly and more small loops are able to contribute at their fundamental frequency longer throughout cosmic history .",
    "the populations of loops contributing to the background fall naturally into two categories  @xcite : the high redshift `` h '' population of long - decayed loops , and the present - day `` p '' population , where the redshift is of the order unity or less .",
    "the spectrum from the h population , which have long decayed and whose radiation is highly redshifted , is nearly independent of frequency for an early universe with a @xmath52 equation of state .",
    "the p loops have a spectrum of sizes up to the hubble length ; they create a peak in the spectrum corresponding approximately to the fundamental mode of the loops whose decay time is the hubble time today , and a high frequency tail mainly from higher modes of those loops . for all of the observable loops ( that is , less than tens of light years across ) , formation occurred during radiation era ( that is , when the universe was less than @xmath53 years old ) .",
    "as in hogan @xcite we use scaling to normalize to the high frequency results from r.r .",
    "caldwell and b. allen @xcite : @xmath54 , where p=1 . at the high frequency limit of our curves",
    "this relation is used to normalize the parameterization for the number of loops created at a given time .",
    "loop sizes are approximated by the `` one - scale '' model in which the length of created loops scale with the size of the hubble radius .",
    "the infinite strings create loops with a size that scales with the expansion , creating a distribution with a characteristic size @xmath55 .",
    "the expression for the average length of newly formed loops is @xmath56 , where @xmath3 measures the length of the loop as a fraction of the hubble radius .",
    "it is assumed that the newly formed , stably orbiting loops form a range of lengths at a given time , and this range peaks near @xmath3 . for the numerical calculations , and",
    "to facilitate comparison with previous work , we use a delta function for the length .",
    "thus only one length of loop is created at a given time and this is the average length defined above . because of the averaging introduced by the expansion , this introduces only a small error unless the distribution of sizes is large , on the order of several orders of magnitude or more  @xcite , which would no longer be a one scale model . as a check ,",
    "models of loop formation with several loop sizes are also analyzed , and it is found that the larger loops tend to dominate the background over the smaller .",
    "the loops start to decay as soon as they are created at time @xmath57 , and are described by the equation : @xmath58 ( this expression is not valid as @xmath59 but is an adequate approximation . as the length approaches zero eqn .",
    "[ eqs : length ] becomes less accurate , but in this limit the loops are small and contribute only to the high frequency red noise region of the gravitational wave background .",

    "the change in cosmology , i.e. the inclusion of a cosmological constant , is not a cause of significant variation .",

    "smaller @xmath21 increases the amplitude of the peak and the flat portion of spectrum , while leading to a decrease in the high frequency region .",
    "this occurs because the loops decay more quickly for larger @xmath21 and have less time to contribute over the long time periods of cosmology . in the matter dominated era the higher luminosity allows the loops to contribute more to the high frequency region , although it does not increase the peak amplitude .",

    "the main source of error is the relativistic treatment of neutrinos for all time , but this will incur a very small error in more recent times . given that neutrinos have mass , it is possible several species will be non - relativistic at the present time .",
    "this is a minimal consideration as the matter and dark energy contributions are larger by at least five orders of magnitude when the neutrinos are non - relativistic .",

    "an interpolation function is made from this list , and this results in the number density as a function of time @xmath69 , @xmath145 .",
    "but the frequencies must be redshifted to the current time @xmath82 so the function is @xmath166",
    ".    then we must integrate over all @xmath69 from the earliest time of loop formation @xmath83 to the present age of the universe @xmath82 .",
    "this integral , @xmath167 is transformed into a sum , @xmath168 suitable @xmath169 s are chosen to ensure both computability and to minimize errors . in general we solve all equations in logarithmic bins so @xmath169 will vary in accordance .",
    "using small values of @xmath170 to facilitate computation speed will result in relatively small error ; choosing @xmath171 in log scale gives a 10% smaller value for @xmath30 compared to @xmath172 or @xmath173 in log scale .",
    "values smaller than @xmath173 give little or no change to the background .",
    "after the sum the result is the gravitational wave density as a function of frequency at the present time .    to include higher modes the power coefficients @xmath86 must be included in the calculation .",
    "the subscript @xmath174 is used instead of @xmath75 here to prevent confusion with the number density , @xmath145 . at each time",
    "@xmath69 the number density , and thus the time rate of change of the energy density , of loops is calculated exactly as above , but more frequencies are included . each number density at frequency @xmath85 is summed and weighted with @xmath86 , and this number density is then integrated over cosmic history , @xmath175 the overall integral is then transformed into a sum as before .",
