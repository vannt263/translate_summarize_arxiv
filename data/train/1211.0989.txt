    "in relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments a large second fourier harmonic is observed in two - particle correlations as a function of relative azimuthal angle  @xcite .",
    "this has long been considered a sign of significant collective behavior  @xcite , or `` elliptic flow '' , indicating the existence of a strongly - interacting , low - viscosity fluid  @xcite .",
    "however , only recently has it been realized that _ all _ such correlations observed between particles separated by a large relative pseudorapidity could be explained by this collective behavior  @xcite , at least for the bulk of the system .",
    "one significant piece of evidence for this view was the recent observation of the factorization  @xcite of two - particle correlations into a product of a function of properties of only one of the particles times a function of the properties of the second .",
    "specifically , for pairs of particles in various bins of transverse momentum @xmath0 , factorization of each fourier harmonic was tested as  @xcite : @xmath1 where the brackets indicate an average over pairs of particles ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) coming from the same event as well as an average over a set of collision events , and @xmath4 is the azimuthal angle of particle @xmath5 .",
    "the left - hand side is a ( symmetric ) function of two variables , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and in general may not factorize into a product of a function @xmath8 of each variable individually .",
    "the fact that this factorization holds at least approximately , then , is a non - trivial observation about the structure of the correlation .",
    "while most known sources of non - flow correlations do not factorize at low @xmath0  @xcite , a type of factorization comes naturally in a pure hydrodynamic picture where particles are emitted independently .",
    "they thus have no intrinsic correlations with other particles , carrying only information about their orientation with respect to the system as a whole .",
    "this causes the two - particle probability distribution in a single collision event to factorize  @xcite into a product of one - particle distributions , @xmath9    inspired by this fact , it has often been stated  @xcite that the factorization test in eq .   should work perfectly in hydrodynamics .",
    "the observed approximate factorization was hailed as a success for the flow interpretation of correlations , while small deviations from the factorized form was interpreted as a gradual breakdown of the hydrodynamic description with increasing transverse momentum , and of increasing contribution from other sources of correlations .    in this work ,",
    "we show that factorization as in eq .",
    "is not necessarily present even in an ideal hydrodynamic system governed by eq .",
    ", because of event - by - event fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "these stem from quantum fluctuations : the collision takes place over a very short timescale , and takes a snapshot of the wavefunction of incoming nuclei . in the presence of fluctuations , we show that the correlation matrix satisfies general inequalities , which are saturated by eq .  .",
    "we test these inequalities on alice data and point out where breaking of factorization occurs .",
    "we then illustrate with a full event - by - event hydrodynamic calculation that the same deviation seen in experiment is also present in ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "we begin by recalling the discussion originally found in ref .  @xcite . in a pure hydrodynamic picture ,",
    "particles are emitted independently from the fluid at the end of the system evolution according to some underlying one - particle probability distribution .",
    "one can write any such distribution as a fourier series in the azimuthal angle @xmath10 of the particles @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13th complex fourier flow coefficient , and curly brackets indicate an average over the probability density in a single event . writing @xmath14 , where @xmath8 is the ( real ) anisotropic flow coefficient and @xmath15 the corresponding phase , and using @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the complex conjugate of @xmath18 ) , this can be rewritten as @xmath19 note that , for this form to describe an arbitrary distribution , both @xmath8 and @xmath15 may depend on transverse momentum @xmath0 and pseudorapidity @xmath20 .    in this picture , the relation in eq",
    ".   holds , and a complex fourier harmonic of the two - particle correlation factorizes in each event as : @xmath21 this factorization only holds in a single hydro event .",
    "both the magnitudes and the phases of anisotropic flow fluctuate event to event  @xcite . the experimental quantity , eq .",
    ", is then obtained by averaging over events : @xmath22 due to parity symmetry , only the real part remains after this average , hence the cosine in eq .  .",
    "from this relation alone , one can make the following general statements about the event - averaged correlation matrix : the diagonal elements must be positive , and the off - diagonal elements must satisfy a cauchy - schwarz inequality , @xmath23 factorization , eq .",
    ", implies that the second inequality is saturated , i.e. , equality is achieved .",
    "thus , while flow does not necessarily imply factorization , any violation of these inequalities is an unambiguous indication of the presence of non - flow correlations .",
    "an inspection of published data from the alice collaboration  @xcite shows that these inequalities are indeed violated in certain regimes  @xcite . for @xmath24 , diagonal elements @xmath25 are negative above 5  gev for 010% centrality , and above 4  gev for 4050% centrality",
    "this is a clear indication that there are nonflow correlations at high @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , the correlation between back - to - back jets typically yields a relative angle @xmath26 , thus producing a negative @xmath27 at high @xmath0 . for @xmath28 ,",
    "diagonal elements are negative not only at high @xmath0 ( with a slightly higher threshold than for @xmath24 ) , but also for @xmath0 between 1 and 1.5  gev .",
    "this is believed to be caused by the correlation from global momentum conservation  @xcite , but it is interesting to note that its effect can be noticed by a simple inspection of elements .        in order to check the validity of the second inequality , we introduce the ratio    @xmath29    which is defined when diagonal elements @xmath30 and @xmath31 are both positive , and lies between @xmath32 and @xmath33 if eq",
    ".   holds .",
    "factorization corresponds to the limit @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cauchy ] displays @xmath35 and @xmath36 as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 for pb - pb collisions at 2.76  tev , 010% centrality .",
    "alice results for @xmath35 satisfy the inequalities at all @xmath0 .",
    "when both particles are below @xmath37  gev , the inequality is saturated , @xmath38 , within errors .",
    "as soon as one of the particles is above @xmath37  gev , however , @xmath35 is smaller than unity , and the difference with unity increases with the difference @xmath39 .",
    "results for @xmath36 are qualitatively similar below 5  gev , with larger error bars .",
    "however , @xmath36 is closer to 1 than @xmath35 between 2 and 3  gev .",
    "the values of @xmath40 for mid - central collisions ( 40 - 50% centrality , not shown ) are comparable to the values for central collisions , although @xmath35 is slightly closer to 1 .",
    "the alice collaboration concluded from their analysis that factorization holds approximately for @xmath41 and @xmath0 below @xmath42  gev .",
    "however , their results actually show evidence for a slight breaking of factorization for @xmath43 , as soon as one of the particles has @xmath44  gev . even though factorization is broken , the general inequalities implied by flow are satisfied for @xmath43 and @xmath24 below 5  gev for central collisions .",
    "it is therefore worth investigating in more detail to what extent the breaking of factorization which is seen experimentally can be understood within hydrodynamics .",
    "first , we recall under which conditions factorization holds in hydrodynamics .",
    "it implies that the cauchy - schwarz inequality   is saturated . by inspection of eq .",
    ", this in turn implies that the complex flow vectors @xmath45 and @xmath46 are linearly dependent .",
    "this is true only under the following assumptions :    1 .   by parity symmetry , @xmath47 in each event .",
    "i.e. , @xmath15 does not depend on @xmath0 , which removes the exponential from the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "@xmath48 changes from event to event by only a global factor , with no @xmath0-dependent fluctuations .",
    "@xmath48 in the right - hand side of eq .   then represents the rms value over events .    in general , fluctuations ensure that these conditions are not met exactly , and the factorization of eq .",
    "will not be perfect . within hydrodynamics , the ratio @xmath40 in eq .",
    "has a simple interpretation . inserting eq .   into eq .",
    ", one obtains    @xmath49    the ratio @xmath40 thus represents the linear correlation between the complex flow vectors at momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 . since in each event , @xmath45 is a smooth function of @xmath6 , one expects that the correlation is stronger when @xmath50 , and decreases as the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath7 increases , as a result of the decoherence induced by initial fluctuations .",
    "alice data confirm this qualitative expectation .",
    "note that even in a single hydrodynamic event , factorization holds in the complex form eq .  , but is broken if one takes the real part before averaging over particle pairs , as in eq .  .",
    "the ratio @xmath40 in eq .",
    "is then @xmath51 , which is smaller than unity as soon as the flow angle @xmath15 depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the question then becomes : how large are factorization - breaking effects in hydrodynamics , and do they have the same properties as seen in data ? if purely hydrodynamic calculations give the same result as experiment , then the observed breaking of factorization may not indicate the presence of non - flow correlations .",
    "to illustrate these concepts we perform calculations using the nexspherio model  @xcite .",
    "this model solves the equations of relativistic ideal hydrodynamics with fluctuating initial conditions given by the nexus event generator  @xcite .",
    "it has proven succesful in reproducing rhic results , in particular the structure of two - particle angular correlations in au - au collisions at the top rhic energy  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown to reproduce the whole set of measured anisotropic flow data  @xcite .",
    "our calculations are therefore performed for au - au collisions at the top rhic energy , not for pb - pb collisions at lhc energy , as would be appropriate for a direct quantitative comparison with alice data .",
    "our results are merely meant as a proof of concept , and as a prediction for measurements at rhic .",
    "note that the main source of fluctuations ( namely , the finite number of nucleons within the nucleus ) is identical in both cases .",
    "we run @xmath52 nexus events , which are then sorted into @xmath53 centrality bins defined by the number of participant nucleons , and then evolved hydrodynamically .",
    "anisotropic flow is calculated accurately in every event  @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath40 is displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : cauchy ] for @xmath43 and @xmath24 .",
    "deviations from the factorization limit @xmath54 are already seen at low momentum but become larger as the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath7 increases , as expected from the general arguments above .",
    "surprisingly , the breaking of factorization appears _",
    "larger _ in hydrodynamics than in experiment .",
    "the alice collaboration has studied factorization by performing a global fit of the measured correlation @xmath55 by the right - hand side of eq .  , where @xmath48 is a fit parameter  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the measured correlation to the best fit differs from unity if factorization is broken .",
    "we can apply the same procedure to our hydrodynamic results .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : globalfit ] . again",
    ", hydrodynamic calculations and experimental data show similar trends , with the noticeable difference that the breaking of factorization is significantly _ stronger _ in ideal hydrodynamics than in data .",
    "several effects can explain this discrepancy .",
    "first , the average @xmath0 is significantly larger at lhc than at rhic  @xcite , so that it might be more natural to compare , e.g. , 4  gev at rhic to 5  gev at lhc , rather than doing the comparison at the same @xmath0 .",
    "the second effect is viscosity , which is neglected in our calculation .",
    "shear viscosity , in particular , tends to damp the effect of initial fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural that it will also decrease the breaking of factorization induced by initial fluctuations .",
    "a similar observation is that the linear correlation between the initial eccentricity and the final anisotropic flow is stronger in viscous hydrodynamics  @xcite than in ideal hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the detailed structure of two - particle angular correlations contains much more information than traditional analyses of anisotropic flow , where the correlation is averaged over one of the particles  @xcite .",
    "even though such two - dimensional analyses are much more demanding in terms of statistics than traditional analyses , they bring new , independent insight into the underlying physics of flow fluctuations .",
    "in particular , we have shown that quantum fluctuations in the wavefunction of incoming nuclei result in a decoherence in the angular correlations produced by collective flow , which becomes increasingly important as the difference between particle momenta increases . due to this effect",
    ", factorization of angular correlations is broken even if collective flow is the only source of correlations .",
    "our numerical calculations show that factorization breaking can be as strong in hydrodynamics as in experimental data , thereby suggesting that all correlations below @xmath56  gev ( for central pb - pb collisions at lhc near midrapidity ) may actually be dominated by flow",
    ". the sensitivity of this decoherence phenomenon to viscosity has not yet been investigated , but we anticipate that factorization should be restored as viscosity increases , thus potentially offering a new means of constraining the viscosity from data . on the other hand ,",
    "thermal fluctuations should be considered along with viscosity  @xcite , and may also contribute to factorization breaking .",
    "decoherence also provides a natural explanation for the important observation that event - by - event fluctuations reduce elliptic flow at high @xmath0  @xcite , thus improving agreement between hydrodynamics and experimental data .",
    "indeed , @xmath57 at high @xmath0 is inferred from azimuthal correlations between a high @xmath0 particle and all other particles  mostly low @xmath0 particles , and these azimuthal correlations are reduced due to the decoherence phenomenon .",
    "note that the other main explanation for the reduction of @xmath57 at high @xmath0 , viscosity , typically relies on the assumption of a quadratic momentum dependence of the viscous correction to the distribution function at freeze - out @xmath58 , which may not be correct  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we have focused on the transverse momentum dependence of the correlations .",
    "the rapidity dependence of the correlation is also worth investigating . in particular",
    ", it was recently observed that azimuthal correlations decrease as a function of the relative pseudorapidity  @xcite , at variance with common lore that correlations due to flow are essentially independent of rapidity .",
    "while standard models of initial conditions do predict a mild rapidity dependence of azimuthal correlations  @xcite , longitudinal fluctuations  @xcite could also produce a decoherence effect similar to the one studied here .",
    "the detailed structure of two - particle correlations as a function of both particle momenta thus opens a new window on the study of flow fluctuations .",
