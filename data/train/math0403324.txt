    "in this paper , we introduce * quadri - tilings * and a sub - family of all quadri - tilings called * triangular quadri - tilings*. in order to explain the originality of this model , let us go back to the yet classical domino and lozenge tilings , see for example @xcite . both models are dimer models ( see below ) on a _ fixed _ graph , the square lattice @xmath3 , and the equilateral triangular lattice @xmath4 , respectively . by the means of a _ height function _ , they can be interpreted as random discrete interfaces in dimension @xmath5 , that is as random discrete surfaces of dimension @xmath6 in a space of dimension @xmath7 that have been projected to the plane @xcite . keeping this in mind",
    ", one can now explain the interesting feature of quadri - tilings : they correspond to dimer models on a _ family _ of graphs , instead of a fixed graph as was the case up to now .",

    "it is the first such model arising from dimer models . using tools of the dimer model , we are able to give an explicit expression for a gibbs measure on triangular quadri - tilings , as well as a surprising property of the asymptotics of this measure . in the course of doing so , we prove a conjecture of @xcite .",
    "quadri - tilings are defined as follows .",
    "consider the set of right triangles whose hypotenuses have length two . color the vertex at the right angle black , and the other two vertices white .",
    "a * quadri - tile * is a quadrilateral obtained from two such triangles in two different ways : either glue them along the hypotenuse , or supposing they have a leg of the same length , glue them along this edge matching the black ( white ) vertex to the black ( white ) one , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "note that both types of quadri - tiles have four vertices .",
    "a * quadri - tiling * of the plane is an edge - to - edge tiling of the plane by quadri - tiles that respects the coloring of the vertices , that is black ( resp .",
    "white ) vertices are matched to black ( resp .",
    "white ) ones .",
    "an example of quadri - tiling is given in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "in all that follows , we consider quadri - tilings of the plane that use finitely many different quadri - tiles up to isometry .",
    "the goal of section [ sec2 ] is to precisely describe the features of quadri - tilings . in order to give some insight ,",
    "let us define * @xmath6-tiling models * or equivalently * dimer models*. a * @xmath6-tile * of an infinite graph @xmath9 is a polygon made of two adjacent inner faces of @xmath9 , and a * @xmath6-tiling * of @xmath9 is a covering of @xmath9 with @xmath6-tiles , such that there are no holes and no overlaps .",
    "the * dual graph * @xmath10 of @xmath9 is the graph whose vertices correspond to faces of @xmath9 , two vertices of @xmath10 being joined by an edge if the corresponding faces are adjacent .",
    "a * dimer configuration * of @xmath10 , also called * perfect matching * , is a subset of edges of @xmath10 which covers each vertex exactly once .",
    "then @xmath6-tilings of the graph @xmath9 are in bijection with dimer configurations of the dual graph @xmath10 , as explained by the following correspondence .",
    "denote by @xmath11 the dual vertex of a face @xmath9 , and consider an edge @xmath12 of @xmath10 .",
    "we say that the @xmath6-tile of @xmath9 made of the adjacent faces @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the @xmath6-tile * corresponding * to the edge @xmath12 .",
    "then , @xmath6-tiles corresponding to edges of a dimer configuration of @xmath10 form a @xmath6-tiling of @xmath9 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath15 the set of perfect matching of the graph @xmath10 .",
    "prior to describing section [ sec2 ] , we need one more definition .",
    "if @xmath16 is a rhombus tiling of the plane , then the corresponding * rhombus - with - diagonals tiling * , denoted by @xmath17 , is the graph obtained from @xmath16 by adding the diagonals of the rhombi . in the whole of this paper , we suppose that rhombus tilings of the plane have only finitely many rhombus angles .    in section [ subsec21 ]",
    ", we prove the main feature of quadri - tilings , i.e. that they correspond to @xmath6-tilings on a family of graphs , which consists of rhombus - with - diagonals tilings .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath18 is a quadri - tiling , then by a geometric construction , we associate to @xmath18 a rhombus - with - diagonals tiling @xmath19 , such that @xmath18 is a @xmath6-tiling of @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding rhombus tiling @xmath20 is called the * underlying rhombus tiling * of @xmath18 .",
    "* triangular quadri - tilings * consist in the sub - family of all quadri - tilings whose underlying tiling is a lozenge tiling , where * lozenges * are defined to be @xmath21-rhombi ; refer to figure [ fig15 ] for an example , and to section [ subsec21 ] for the construction of the underlying tiling . in order to distinguish general rhombus tilings , denoted @xmath16 , from lozenge tilings , we denote the latter by @xmath22 .",
    "the set of all triangular quadri - tilings up to isometry is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath23 corresponds to two superposed dimer models .",
    "indeed , let @xmath18 be a triangular quadri - tiling , then @xmath18 is a @xmath6-tiling of its underlying lozenge - with - diagonals tiling @xmath24 , moreover the corresponding lozenge tiling @xmath25 is a @xmath6-tiling of the equilateral triangular lattice @xmath4 .",

    "section [ subsec22 ] consists in the geometric interpretation of triangular quadri - tilings using height functions . on the vertices of every triangular quadri - tiling @xmath18 , we define a @xmath26-valued function @xmath27 , called the * first height function * , corresponding to the `` height '' of @xmath18 interpreted as a @xmath6-tiling of its underlying lozenge - with - diagonals tiling @xmath24 .",
    "then , we assign a * second height function * @xmath28 ( thurston s height function on lozenges @xcite ) corresponding to the height of @xmath25 interpreted as a @xmath6-tiling of @xmath4 , see figure [ fig3 ] . hence triangular quadri - tilings are characterized by two height functions , and so can be interpreted as discrete interfaces in dimension @xmath1 . in section [ subsec23 ] ,",
    "we give elementary operations that allow to transform any triangular quadri - tiling of a simply connected region into any other .",
    "the dimer model belongs to the field of statistical mechanics , hence there are natural measures to consider , boltzmann and gibbs measures , which are defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath9 be an infinite graph , and let @xmath29 be a positive weight function on the edges of @xmath10 .",
    "consider a finite sub - graph @xmath30 of @xmath9 , then the * boltzmann measure * on the set of dimer configurations @xmath31 of @xmath32 , corresponding to the weight function @xmath29 , is defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the * dimer partition function*. a * gibbs measure * is a probability measure on @xmath15 with the following property . if the matching in an annular region is fixed , the matchings inside and outside of the annulus are independent of each other , and the probability of any interior matching @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath36",
    ".    an important question in solving a dimer model is the study of local statistics , i.e. to obtain an explicit expression for the set of gibbs measures .",
    "kenyon , okounkov and sheffield @xcite give such an expression for the two - parameter family of gibbs measures on dimer configurations of doubly periodic bipartite graphs .",
    "the expression they obtain involves the limiting inverse kasteleyn matrix which is hard to evaluate in general , often implying elliptic integrals . in another paper @xcite , for graphs",
    "@xmath9 which have bipartite duals and satisfy a geometric condition called * isoradiality * , kenyon defines a specific weight function on the edges of @xmath10 called the * critical * weight function . he also defines the dirac operator @xmath37 indexed by the vertices of @xmath10 , and gives an explicit expression for its inverse @xmath38 ( see also sections [ subsec31 ] and [ subsec32 ] ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath38 has the interesting property of only depending on the _ local geometry _ of the graph .",
    "kenyon conjectures that @xmath38 is , in some sense to be determined , the limiting inverse kasteleyn matrix . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we consider a general rhombus - with - diagonals tiling of the plane @xmath17 .",
    "it has the property of being an isoradial graph , so that we assign the critical weight function to edges of @xmath2 .",
    "theorem [ thm2 ] of section [ subsec33 ] ( see also theorem [ thm0 ] below ) proves an explicit expression for a gibbs measure @xmath39 on @xmath40 , as a function of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "for every subset of edges @xmath41 of @xmath2 , the * cylinder * @xmath42 is defined to be the set of dimer configurations of @xmath2 that contain these edges .",
    "then    [ thm0 ] there is a probability measure @xmath39 on @xmath43 such that , for every cylinders @xmath42 of @xmath2 , @xmath44 moreover @xmath39 is a gibbs measure on @xmath40 .",
    "when @xmath2 is doubly periodic , @xmath39 is the unique gibbs measure which has minimal free energy per fundamental domain among the two - parameter family of ergodic gibbs measures of @xcite .    1",
    ".   note that we do not ask the graph @xmath2 to be periodic .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm0 ] is the subject of section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the argument in the case where @xmath2 is not periodic relies on the argument in the case where @xmath2 is doubly periodic , combined with a non - trivial geometric property of rhombus tilings proved in proposition  [ prop1 ] :  every finite simply connected sub - graph of a rhombus tiling can be embedded in a periodic rhombus tiling of the plane . \" 2 .   from the proof of theorem [ thm0 ] , it appears that the statement is true for all doubly periodic isoradial graphs with bipartite duals .",
    "hence , theorem  [ thm0 ] solves the conjecture of @xcite of interpreting the inverse dirac operator as the limiting inverse kasteleyn matrix .",
    "moreover , the fact that the measure @xmath39 is of minimal free energy per fundamental domain makes it of special interest among the two - parameter family of ergodic gibbs measures of @xcite .",
    "3 .   using the locality property of @xmath38 mentioned above , we deduce that the expression ( [ 3 ] ) only depends on the local geometry of the graph , hence it yields an easy way of computing local statistics explicitly .",
    "this is very surprising in regards of the expression obtained in @xcite , and we believe this locality property to be true only in the isoradial case with critical weights .    in section [ sec5 ] , we extend the notion of gibbs measure to the set of all triangular quadri - tilings @xmath23 . then , as a corollary to theorem [ thm0 ] we deduce an explicit expression for such a gibbs measure @xmath45 , and conjecture it to be that of minimal free energy per fundamental domain among a four parameter family of gibbs measures .    in section [ sec6 ]",
    ", we consider a general rhombus - with - diagonals tiling of the plane @xmath17 .",
    "we assign the critical weight function to edges of @xmath2 , and let @xmath37 be the dirac operator indexed by vertices of @xmath2 . theorem [ thm7 ] of section [ subsec61 ] ( see also theorem [ thm1 ] below ) establishes that asymptotically ( as @xmath46 ) and up to the second order term , @xmath47 only depends on the rhombi to which the vertices @xmath48 and @xmath49 belong , and else is independent of the structure of the graph @xmath17 . for a general isoradial graph , kenyon @xcite gives an asymptotic formula for @xmath47 which depends on the angles of an edge - path from @xmath49 to @xmath48 .",
    "hence , it is an interesting and surprising fact that the dependence on the edges along the path should asymptotically disappear in the case of rhombus - with - diagonals tilings .",
    "[ thm1 ] as @xmath46 , @xmath47 is equal to    @xmath50    as a consequence of theorem [ thm1 ] , we deduce that when edges @xmath51 of @xmath2 are asymptotically far apart , @xmath52 only depends on the rhombi to which the edges @xmath51 belong , and else is independent of the structure of the graph @xmath17 ( corollary [ cor1 ] ) .",
