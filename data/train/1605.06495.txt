    "the two fast growing fields of cavity optomechanics @xcite and trapped ions @xcite have been opening new avenues for the investigation of quantum phenomena .",
    "in particular , one may consider the confinement of a trapped ion in a cavity @xcite which would allow , for instance , the coupling of the quantized cavity field with the trapped ion itself @xcite .",
    "this forms a bipartite quantum system constituted by a massive particle ( ion ) and the electromagnetic field . among the possible applications related to the trapped ion system",
    ", we could cite proposals for quantum information processing , e.g. , quantum computing using laser driven trapped ions @xcite , as well as cavity - assisted quantum computing @xcite .",
    "another interesting quantum system is the one involving a  macroscopic \" massive object ( mirror ) interacting with the electromagnetic field . in a cavity",
    "having a moving mirror , it is possible to couple ( via radiation pressure ) that mirror with its own cavity field @xcite .",
    "considering the trapped ion - field and mirror - field systems independently , the involved interactions naturally lead on one side , to the entanglement between the vibrating ion and the field @xcite and on the other side , the entanglement between the oscillating mirror and the field @xcite .",
    "we could thus think about the feasibility of generating entanglement between the ( microscopic ) ionic subsystem and the ( macroscopic ) mirror via the fields . regarding the optomechanical cavities , we should point out that there are already proposals for the generation of entanglement in a system involving two cavities ; more specifically , between two moving mirrors belonging to distinct cavities @xcite .",
    "here we would like to discuss the possibility of entangling the moving ion located within cavity 1 , with the moving mirror in cavity 2 using an interferometry - based scheme of the outgoing fields similar to the one presented in @xcite .",
    "the cavities are placed in such a way that the trapped ion cavity is along one arm ( arm 1 ) of an interferometer and the optomechanical cavity is along the other arm ( arm 2 ) . we show that the generation of ion - mirror entanglement may be achieved under certain conditions , and that the resulting entangled states have component states involving ( discrete ) fock and ( continuous variable ) coherent states , i.e. , they are hybrid entangled states @xcite .",
    "we remark that the concept of hybrid entanglement is also relevant for quantum information processing purposes .",
    "for instance , we may find in the literature proposals of quantum gates @xcite as well as quantum repeaters @xcite based on hybrid ( discrete / continuous variable ) states .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the dynamics of the ion trapped in a cavity as well as the optomechanical cavity ; in section 3 we present our scheme for the ion - mirror entanglement .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "we consider , as shown in fig.(1 ) , an interferometer having two arms ; a cavity containing a single ( two - level ) ion confined inside a paul trap is positioned in arm 1 and an optomechanical cavity with a moving mirror is placed in arm 2 .",
    "firstly we are going to describe the preparation of the ionic and optomechanical systems themselves , which corresponds to the independent preparation of an entangled state of the ion with the field in cavity 1 , as well as an entangled state involving the moving mirror with the field in cavity 2 .",
    "the hamiltonian describing dynamics of the quantized cavity field coupled to the ion ( vibrational motion + internal electronic states ) may be written as @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1(@xmath2 ) denotes the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the cavity fields ( with frequency @xmath3 ) , @xmath4(@xmath5 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the vibrational degree of freedom of the center - of - mass of the ion ( with frequency @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 it is the atomic frequency , @xmath8 is the ion - field coupling constant , and @xmath9 is the lamb - dicke parameter ; @xmath10 being the typical amplitude of the ion s harmonic motion and @xmath11 is the wavelength of the cavity field .",
    "the hamiltonian above may be linearized if the ion is confined in a region typically much smaller than the wavelength of light , or @xmath12 ( lamb - dicke regime ) .",
    "an adequate way of treating the photon leaking process ( from the cavities ) is via the quantum jump formalism @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the cavity ( having decay rate @xmath13 ) with a trapped ion governing the evolution while there is no photon detection , is given by @xmath14    if we tune the system to the first red sideband ( @xmath15 ) , we obtain , in the interaction picture , @xmath16    thus the associated non - hermitian evolution operator is @xmath17.\\ ] ]    we may choose the initial joint ion - cavity state state as being @xmath18 where @xmath19 e @xmath20 are the cavity field state ( arm 1 ) and the vibrational ionic state , respectively , prepared in fock states .",
    "we remark that in order to generate an entangled ( ion + field ) state , the ion s electronic states must be prepared in a superposition of the  ground \" state @xmath21 and the  excited \" state @xmath22 .",
    "we have also included a relative phase @xmath23 between the component states .",

    "in order to establish entanglement between the ion and the moving mirror subsystems , the fields from each cavity may be combined using , for instance , a beam - splitter @xcite , as shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "after impinging the beam splitter , photons leaking from the cavities may be detected by the photocounters @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "firstly we are going to consider the first red sideband preparation for the ionic system .",
    "if no photons are detected by @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) , the joint state in the beginning of the detection stage will be the product of @xmath67 , the ionic - cavity field state ( arm 1 ) in eq.([ionfieldstate ] ) and @xmath68 , the mirror - cavity field ( arm 2 ) in eq.([mirrorfieldstate ] ) .",
    "note that it is required a precise synchronization of the actions during the process .",

    "we have presented a scheme for entanglement generation between a moving mirror and a trapped ion assisted by the quantized fields of two cavities . the mirror as well as the ion independently couple to the quantized fields of their own cavities . after an adequate preparation of the initial states ,",
    "the outgoing cavity fields are combined in a beam - splitter followed by photodetection , which collapses the global state and allows the generation of entangled states involving the ion and mirror subsystems .",
