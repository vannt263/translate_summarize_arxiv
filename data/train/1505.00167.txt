    "7 , we illustrate such a difference by computing the chern number @xmath194 at a given energy on the disordered kagome lattice with translational symmetry breaking ( using non - commutative rules and averaging over disorder configurations ) @xcite .",
    "the common characteristic of the flat middle band and the lower band is that as soon as disorder is turned on @xmath195 starts decreasing from @xmath196 in the close vicinity of the band edge , as indicated in the plots of fig .",
    "we also notice that disorder effects have already been controlled and adjusted in superconducting circuits @xcite .",
    "very recently , another progress was achieved in cqed @xcite , by observing similar topological effects and simulating directly the haldane - type hamiltonian @xmath197 , where @xmath198 corresponds to the second - neighbor hopping ( tunneling ) in a local magnetic field .",
    "this hamiltonian has been implemented with one or two superconducting qubits on the bloch sphere : the bz on a torus is then simply replaced by an integration over the polar and azimuthal angles on the bloch sphere .",
    "a path from north to south pole on the bloch sphere was achieved in time , through microwave pulses .",
    "note that these measurements constitute a dynamical ( direct ) measurement of the berry phase .",
    "these measurements use the general scheme proposed in ref .",
    "other measurements of the berry phase were also done in ref .",
    "motion in a curved space will be deflected from a straight trajectory and the state of the system feels a force leading to deviations from the adiabatic path .",
    "the experiments have directly measured the chern number @xmath199 where the berry curvature component @xmath200 encodes the information of the force and is related to the spin observable @xmath201 ( the experiments work at constant speed allowing a linear response ) .",
    "the two experiments report a quantized chern number @xmath196 for @xmath202 and a topological phase transition for @xmath203 where the chern number drops to zero .",
    "the goal to achieve arbitrary control of photon flows has motivated an increasing recent research on photonic crystals , metamaterials and artificial quantum circuits . here , we first review the theoretical proposal of ref . @xcite and describe the emergence of protected one - way photon edge states that are robust against disorder , without the use of magneto - optical effects @xcite ( see also fig . 6 , top , left ) . using simple protocols , based on particular choices of spatial distribution and modulation phases , one can produce an effective magnetic field for photons , leading to a lorentz force .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form ( see figure 6 , middle left ) @xmath204 in this scheme , two neighboring resonators have different frequencies .",
    "one can simulate various situations by adjusting the modulation frequency @xmath205 .",
    "let us assume that we are close to resonance @xmath206 , then we can build a simple physical argument based on the rotating - wave approximation . assuming that @xmath207 , the evolution in time of the photons is controlled by @xmath208 and @xmath209 mostly .",
    "it is then justified to define the operators @xmath210}a_i(b_j)$ ] .    in the rotating frame , the hamiltonian is equivalent to charged particles subject to a magnetic field @xcite : @xmath211",
    "using this resonant scheme , then one can produce an equivalent of peierls phases on a given lattice , for neutral particles ; here , the nearest - neighbor coupling is dominant . in particular , by adjusting experimentally the phases @xmath212 ( see fig .",
    "6 , middle left ) one can realize for example a uniform magnetic field related to the effective vector potential @xmath213 defined as @xmath214 .",
    "an idea to realize the dynamical coupling in photon ( quantum circuit ) systems has been suggested in ref .",
    "a similar scheme has been used in ultra - cold atoms , based on resonant laser - assisted tunneling and tilted lattices @xcite . in the context of ultra - cold atoms ,",
    "tilts can be achieved in various ways , from magnetic to gravitational gradients .    in the case of a uniform net flux",
    ", the effective hamiltonian then exhibits the same properties as a two - dimensional gas in the presence of a uniform magnetic field .",

    "the original hamiltonian is periodic in time @xmath215 and the eigenstates then take the form @xmath216 where @xmath217 represents the `` quasi - energy '' which can be found using the equation @xmath218 .",
    "the time - dependent hamiltonian here takes the particular form : @xmath219 , where @xmath220 .",

    "we expand the effective floquet hamiltonian in powers of @xmath225 .",
    "to first order in @xmath225 , away from the resonance condition , one obtains @xmath226 we assume that the hamiltonian also contains a constant nearest - neighbor hopping term ( which can be generated through a perturbation of the form @xmath227 ) . here",
    ", @xmath228 is the unique nearest neighbor of both sites @xmath229 and @xmath230 . in fig .",
    "6 ( bottom ) , we show one application of floquet theory to realize an anisotropic haldane model ( in agreement with the relative signs generated in the terms for the a and b sub - lattices ) .",
    "the generated @xmath155 terms are indeed anisotropic : the @xmath155 term parallel to the horizontal axis is formally zero .",
    "we have numerically checked that the chern number is still quantized and currents propagate at the edges despite the anisotropic choice of phases .",
    "a generalization of the haldane model on the honeycomb lattice to spin-1/2 particles has been made by kane and mele in 2005 @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath231 the @xmath232 term ( here , purely imaginary ) mimics an atomic spin - orbit coupling @xmath233 .",
    "more precisely , on a given pair @xmath229 and @xmath228 of next - nearest - neighbor sites within the same sub - lattice , we must satisfy @xmath234 .",
    "similar to the haldane model , the spin - orbit @xmath155 term opens a gap in the system .",
    "the main difference is that now the system respects the t - symmetry and is characterized by a different topological invariant .",
    "a simple picture of the edge states is the kramers pair ( fig .",
    "6 , top right ) : a particle ( electron ) with spin - up propagates to the left whereas a particle ( electron ) with spin - down propagates to the right .",
    "this leads to a spin current at the edges and to a @xmath24 type topological invariant @xcite and a spin chern number @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 invariant can also be expressed in terms of the four time - reversal invariant momenta ( points ) in the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "progress have been accomplished in ultra - cold atoms , with magnetic field gradients , to observe such a quantum spin hall state @xcite .",
    "another important progress from the experimental point of view comes from the discovery of mercury telluride materials which have allowed to observe a similar physics in two dimensions , leading to the discovery of two - dimensional topological insulators @xcite . in refs .",

    "we have reached a similar conclusion using the slave - rotor approach @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note the possibility of chiral bogoliubons in a bec system @xcite .",
    "recently , a spinful version has been realized in photon systems by hafezi et al .",
    "@xcite based on a silicon architecture ( see fig . 6 , middle ) : the two spin - polarizations correspond to the two possible circulations ( clockwise or anti - clockwise ) in a given resonator .",
    "the phase between resonators are carefully adjusted to follow the scheme of fig .",
    "the main difference with the usual quantum spin hall effect is that here the two spin polarizations couple when t is not broken . to decouple the two spin polarizations ,",
    "one requires to break the t symmetry ; in this sense , one realizes two independent copies of a harper - hofstadter model ; as a result , topological protection is only partial and limited to devices with no back - scattering .",

    "we follow the recent experiment realized at muenich on a ladder - type geometry @xcite , and focus on the effective ( time - independent ) hamiltonian : @xmath235 @xmath236 denotes the two chain index , @xmath237 is the lattice spacing in both directions ( parallel and perpendicular to the chains ) and we have considered a general gauge field acting on the boson operators of each chain .",
    "we have also added a chemical potential which is justified in ultra - cold atoms , josephson junction arrays and can be simulated in photon networks , as discussed in sec .",
    ", we also consider the effect of on - site repulsion and repulsion between chains , @xmath238 .",
    "the @xmath239 term represents a josephson coupling between chains favoring ( superfluid ) phase - locking between the chains and the occurrence of a superfluid .",
    "the artificial flux phases can be explicitly derived from a floquet approach @xcite .",

    "the key point is that for strong values of @xmath239 , the superfluid phases are pinned such that @xmath244 and therefore we obtain a meissner effect , meaning that @xmath245 in the bulk ( see fig .",

    ", one sees the emergence of vortices ; similarly to type ii superconductors , there is a critical field strength .",
    "another nice phenomenon is that these meissner currents can subsist when entering into a mott phase .",
    "for example , for one boson per rung in average , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , by adjusting the parameters @xmath253 and @xmath254 , one can enter a mott state where the total density in each rung is fixed but still meissner currents develop : this is an example of chiral mott phase which breaks time - reversal symmetry . in fig .",
    "8 , we show that the meissner currents in the mott phase can be already observed for relatively small systems ( with 8 or 16 rungs for example ; these results are obtained with the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and exact diagonalization ) .",
    "more results have been confirmed independently based on the dmrg @xcite .",
    "other chiral phases have been predicted for other filling factors @xcite .",

    "more precisely , as an order parameter , one can define the average current @xmath257 coupling a pair of next - nearest - neighbors which belong to the same sub - lattice . in the superfluid phase with @xmath165 ,",
    "the meissner response to the phase @xmath258 is @xmath259 . in the chiral superfluid phase , one",

    "<S> we show how josephson junction systems can implement the equivalent of the kondo effect with microwave photons . </S>",
    "<S> the kondo effect can be characterized by a renormalized light - frequency and a peak in the rayleigh elastic transmission of a photon . </S>",
    "<S> we also address the physics of hybrid systems comprising mesoscopic quantum dot devices coupled to an electromagnetic resonator . </S>",
    "<S> then , we discuss extensions to quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) networks allowing to engineer the jaynes - cummings lattice and rabi lattice models through the presence of superconducting qubits in the cavities . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the door to novel many - body physics with light out of equilibrium , in relation with the mott - superfluid transition observed with ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices . </S>",
