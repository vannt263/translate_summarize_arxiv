    "the characteristic polynomials of random matrices have attracted considerable attention in the last few years , one reason being that their correlations seem to reflect the correlations of the eigenvalues @xcite .    in this paper",

    "then the symmetric @xmath14 matrix @xmath19 is called the ( unrescaled ) _ sample covariance matrix _ associated with the distribution @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the  values @xmath20 as @xmath21 , for certain choices of the sequences @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .    in a recent paper @xcite we considered the `` square '' case where the difference @xmath26 is fixed .",
    "we showed that in this situation , the second - order  correlation function of the characteristic polynomial of a complex sample covariance matrix is asymptotically given ( after the appropriate rescaling )  by the sine kernel in the bulk of the spectrum ,  by the airy kernel at the soft edge of the spectrum ,  by the bessel kernel at the hard edge of the spectrum .",

    "( theorems [ bulk-2 ] and [ edge-2 ] may be proved similarly . ) in section  3 we  state some auxiliary results concerning bessel functions which are needed for the proofs .",
    "the starting point for the proofs of theorems [ bulk-1 ] and [ edge-1 ] will be the following exponential - type generating function for the second - order correlation function of the characteristic polynomial of the ( unrescaled ) sample covariance matrix satisfying the moment conditions from section  1 :    [ gf ] for any @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 where @xmath52 and @xmath78 in the complex setting , @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the real setting , and @xmath81 denotes the modified bessel function of order @xmath82 .",

    ", we will always consider the principal branch of @xmath86 .",
    "we only give the proofs for the complex setting , the proofs for the real setting being very similar .",

    "( the case where @xmath87 remains bounded is already considered in @xcite . )",
    "furthermore , we will usually omit the index @xmath88 of the parameters , and also of several auxiliary functions defined below . by proposition [ gf ]",
    ", we have the  integral representation @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes a contour around the origin .",
    "similarly as in @xcite , we will show that the main contribution to the contour integral in comes from a small neighborhood of the point @xmath91 . to determine the asymptotic behavior of the values @xmath92 in theorems [ bulk-1 ] and [ edge-1 ]",
    ", we proceed similarly as in @xcite , but we have to address some additional complications arising from the circumstance that @xmath93 . to deal with the this problem , we will use various well - known _ uniform asymptotics _ for the modified bessel function of large positive order ( see chapters 10  and  11 in olver @xcite ) . for convenience , we state these results ( and several bounds deduced therefrom ) in section  3 of this paper .",
    "we will choose the contour @xmath94 consisting of the following parts @xmath95 , @xmath96 ( see  figure  [ newcontour ] ) :    * @xmath97 , @xmath98 , * @xmath99 , @xmath100 , * @xmath101 , @xmath102 , * @xmath103 , @xmath104 , * @xmath105 , @xmath106 ,    here @xmath107 is a positive real number which will finally be chosen sufficiently large , and @xmath108 for the bulk of the spectrum and @xmath109 for the edge of the spectrum .",
    ".,width=249 ]    the rough idea behind the choice of this contour is the following : after the appropriate rescaling , the main contribution to the integral comes from the part @xmath110 , for which we can use the uniform asymptotics for the modified bessel function in the positive half - plane .",
    "the other parts are essentially error terms , which can be made arbitrary small by picking @xmath111 and @xmath88 sufficiently large . however ,",

    "for the contours @xmath115 and @xmath116 , we can use the uniform bounds and for the modified bessel function _ on _ the imaginary axis , including the vicinity of the turning points @xmath114 .    in the following proofs",
    ", we adopt the convention that all asymptotic bounds may depend on the sequence @xmath117 as well as on the `` shift parameters '' @xmath118 , unless otherwise indicated .",
