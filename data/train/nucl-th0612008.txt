    "about fifteen years ago , we started a project aimed to apply to the description of medium and heavy nuclei the correlated basis function ( cbf ) theory , successfully used to describe the nuclear and neutron matter properties @xcite .",

    "we use two and three - body interactions of argonne and urbana type , and we consider all the interaction channels up to the spin - orbit ones .",
    "the complexity of the interaction requires an analogously complex correlation : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a symmetrizer operator and @xmath11 has the form : @xmath12 in the above equation we have adopted the nomenclature commonly used in this field , by defining the operators as : @xmath13\\otimes [ 1,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}}_i\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}}_j ]   \\,\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the tensor operator .",
    "the binding energies and the charge distributions of @xmath15c , @xmath16o , @xmath17ca , @xmath18ca and @xmath19pb doubly closed shell nuclei have been obtained by solving the fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) equations in the single operator chain ( soc ) approximation @xcite .",
    "these calculations have the same accuracy of the best variational calculations done in nuclear and neutron matter @xcite .",
    "by using this fhnc / soc computational scheme we have investigated the effects of the correlations on some ground state quantities which are related to observables .",
    "a first quantity we have studied is the momentum distribution .",
    "it is well known that the short  range correlations enhance by orders of magnitude the high - momentum components of the momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "we have also studied the spectroscopic factors since , as we have already mentioned , their empirical values are always smaller than the independent particle model ( ipm ) predictions .",

    "the agreement between theory and experiment is better for the deeply bound shells than for those levels closer to the fermi surface .",
    "this could be due to the strong coupling between the quasi - hole wave function and the low - lying surface vibrations .",
    "the effects of this coupling , usually called long - range correlations , not explicitly treated by our theory , are expected to be larger for the external shells than for the internal ones .",
