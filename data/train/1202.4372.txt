    "the thermal control of a spacecraft ensures that the temperatures of its various parts are kept within their appropriate ranges @xcite .",
    "the simulation and prediction of temperatures in a spacecraft during a mission are usually carried out by commercial software packages .",
    "these software packages employ `` lumped parameter '' models that describe the spacecraft as a discrete network of nodes , with one energy - balance equation per node .",
    "the equations for the thermal state evolution are coupled nonlinear first - order differential equations , which can be integrated numerically .",
    "given the thermal parameters of the model and its initial thermal state , the numerical integration of the differential equations yields the solution of the problem , namely , the evolution of the node temperatures .",
    "however , a detailed model with many nodes is difficult to handle , and its integration for a sufficiently long time of evolution can take considerable computer time and resources .",
    "therefore , it is very useful to study simplified models and approximate methods of integrating the differential equations .    many spacecraft missions , in particular , satellite missions , consist of an initial transient part and then a stationary part , in which the spacecraft just goes around a closed orbit , in which the heat inputs are periodic .",
    "these periodic heat inputs are expected to induce periodic temperature variations , with a maximum and a minimum temperature in each orbit .",
    "this suggests a conservative approach that consists in computing only the temperatures for the _ hot _ and _ cold cases _ of the given orbit , defining them as the two steady cases with the maximum and minimum heat loads , respectively . naturally , the real temperature variations in the orbit are smaller , because there is not enough time for the hot and cold cases to establish themselves .",
    "in fact , the temperature variations can be considerably smaller , to such a degree that it is necessary to integrate the differential equations , at least approximately .",
    "the differential equations for energy balance are nonlinear due to the presence of radiation couplings , which follow the stefan - boltzmann quartic law .",
    "a common approach to these equations involves a linearization of the radiation terms that approximate them by heat conduction terms @xcite .",
    "this approach transforms the nonlinear equations into standard linear heat conduction equations . but",
    "this approach has not been sufficiently justified , is of a heuristic nature and does not constitute a systematic approximation .",
    "in fact , nonlinear equations are very different from linear equations and , in particular , a periodic driving may not induce periodic solutions but much more complex solutions , namely , _ chaotic _ solutions .",
    "therefore , we have carried out in preceding papers a full nonlinear analysis of spacecraft thermal models @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of the analysis is that the complexities of nonlinear dynamics , such as multiple equilibria and chaos , do not appear in these models .",
    "while the existence of only one equilibrium state can be proved in general , the absence of chaos under driving by variable external heat loads can only be proved for a limited range of magnitudes of the driving loads .",
    "this range presumably includes the magnitudes involved in typical spacecraft orbits .",
    "the proofs in refs .   and are constructive and are based on a perturbation method that is expected to be sound when the _ linear _ equations corresponding to the first perturbative order constitute a good approximation of the nonlinear equations .",
    "this implies that the fully nonlinear solution describes a weakly nonlinear oscillator .",
    "since the perturbative approximation is mathematically rigorous and systematic , it is worthwhile to study in detail the scope of the perturbative linear equations and , furthermore , to compare them with previous linear approaches of a heuristic nature .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the linear method of predicting the thermal behavior of spacecraft in stationary orbits ( sect .",
    "[ linear ] and [ fourier - anal ] ) and to test it on a minimally realistic thermal model of a satellite in a circular orbit . since the general one and two - node models analyzed in refs .   and",
    ", respectively , are too simple , we define in this paper a ten - node thermal model of a small moon - orbiting satellite ( sect .",
    "[ ten - node ] ) .",
    "this model is simple enough to allow us to explicitly show all the quantities involved ( thermal couplings and capacities , heat inputs , etc . ) and it is sufficient for illustrating the main features of the linear approach . as realistic thermal models have many more nodes , we consider in sect .",
    "[ scale ] the important issue of scalability of the method and , hence , its practical applications .",
    "computational aspects of the steady - state problem have been studied by krishnaprakas @xcite and by milman and petrick @xcite , while computational aspects of the direct integration of the nonlinear equations for the unsteady problem have been studied by krishnaprakas @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the linear equations for the stationary but unsteady case and survey its computational aspects .    a note on notation : in the equations that contain matrix or vector quantities , sometimes we use component notation ( with indices ) while other times we use compact matrix notation ( without indices ) , according to the nature of the equations .",
    "a lumped - parameter thermal model of a continuous system consists of a discrete network of isothermal regions ( _ nodes _ ) that represent a partition of the total thermal capacitance and that are linked by thermal conduction and radiation couplings @xcite .",
    "this discretization reduces the integro - differential heat - transfer equations to a set of energy - balance odes , one per node , which control the evolution of the nodes temperatures @xcite : @xmath66 - r_i\\,({t_i}^4- t_{0}^4 ) , \\quad i= 1,\\ldots , n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the number of nodes and @xmath34 contains the total heat input to the @xmath17th - node from external radiation and from internal energy dissipation ( if there is any ) .",
    "the conduction and radiation coupling matrices are denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath67 , respectively ; they are symmetric ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 ; so there are @xmath71 independent coupling coefficients altogether , but many vanish , usually .",
    "the temperature @xmath72  k is the temperature of the environment , namely , the cosmic microwave background radiation . the @xmath17th - node coefficient of radiation to the environment is given by @xmath73 , where @xmath0 denotes the outward facing area , @xmath74 its ( infrared ) emissivity , and @xmath75 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . the constant term @xmath76 can be included in @xmath34 or ignored altogether , if each @xmath77 .",
    "equations  ( [ ode ] ) coincide with the ones implemented in commercial software packages , for example , esatan@xmath44 @xcite .",
    "there is no systematic procedure for finding the analytical solution of a system of nonlinear differential equations , except in some particularly simple cases .",
    "of course , nonlinear systems can always be integrated numerically with finite difference schemes .",
    "methods of this kind are employed in commercial software packages .",
    "when a nonlinear system can be approximated by a linear system and , hence , an approximate analytic solution can be found , this solution constitutes a valuable tool .",
    "actually , one can always resort to some kind of perturbation method to linearize a nonlinear system .",
    "therefore , we now study the rigorous linearization of eqs .",
    "( [ ode ] ) based on a suitable perturbation method , and we also describe , for the sake of a comparison , a heuristic linearization , which actually is best understood in light of the results of the perturbation method .",
    "if we assume that the heat inputs @xmath78 in the energy - balance eqs .",
    "( [ ode ] ) are periodic , namely , that there is a time interval @xmath79 such that @xmath80 , then it seems sensible to study first the effect of the mean heat inputs in a period .",
    "this _ averaging _ method , introduced in refs .   and",
    ", relies on the fact that the _ autonomous _ nonlinear system of odes for constant @xmath81 can be thoroughly analyzed with analytical and numerical methods .",
    "for example , it is possible to determine that there is a unique steady thermal state and that it is ( locally ) stable @xcite .",
    "the actual values of the steady temperatures can be found efficiently with various numerical methods @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the jacobian matrix of the nonlinear system of odes provides us with useful information about the dynamics , in particular , about the approach to steady - state : the eigenvectors represent independent thermal modes and the eigenvalues represent their relaxation times @xcite .",
    "once the averaged equations are solved , the variation of the heat inputs can be considered as a driving of the averaged solutions .",
    "thus , we can define the driving function @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the mean value of @xmath78 over the period of oscillation .",
    "a weak driving function must not produce a notable deviation from the averaged dynamics .",
    "in particular , the long - term thermal state of an orbiting spacecraft must oscillate about the corresponding steady - state .",
    "to embody this idea , we introduce a formal perturbation parameter @xmath84 , to be set to the value of unity at the end , and write eqs .",

    "the initial conditions for these equations are the same as for the unaveraged equations .",
    "for the first order in @xmath84 , we obtain the following system of linear equations : @xmath88 here , @xmath89 is the jacobian matrix @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the solution of the zeroth order equation",

    "the elements of the jacobian matrix at a generic point in the temperature space are calculated to be : @xmath93.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this matrix has interesting properties .",
    "first of all , it has negative diagonal and nonnegative off - diagonal elements . in other words",
    ", @xmath94 is a @xmath95-matrix @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it fulfills a semipositivity condition that qualifies it as a nonsingular @xmath96-matrix @xcite .",
    "since the eigenvalues of an @xmath96-matrix have positive real parts , the opposite holds for @xmath20 , namely , its eigenvalues have negative real parts .",
    "one more interesting property of @xmath94 , related to semipositivity , is that it possesses a form of _ diagonal dominance _",
    ": it is similar to a diagonally dominant matrix and the similarity is given by a positive diagonal matrix .",
    "naturally , this property is shared by @xmath20 .",
    "these properties are useful to prove some desirable properties of the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ linode - pert ] ) .",
    "the chief property of @xmath20 is that @xmath94 is a nonsingular @xmath96-matrix . in particular",
    ", it implies that @xmath97 is non - negative and , therefore , that the perron - frobenius theory is applicable to it @xcite .",
    "the relevant results to be applied are : ( i ) perron s theorem , which states that a _",
    "strictly _ positive matrix has a unique real and positive eigenvalue with a positive eigenvector and that this eigenvalue has maximal modulus among all the eigenvalues ; ( ii ) a second theorem , stating that if a @xmath95-matrix that is a nonsingular @xmath96-matrix is also `` irreducible '' , then its inverse is strictly positive .",
    "the irreducibility of @xmath20 follows from the symmetry of the matrices @xmath27 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "as the positive ( perron ) eigenvector of @xmath97 is the eigenvector of @xmath20 that corresponds to its smallest magnitude eigenvalue , it defines the slowest relaxation mode ( for a given set of temperatures ) .",
    "therefore , in the evolution of temperatures given by eqs .",
    "( [ bode - pert ] ) , steady - state is eventually approached from the zone corresponding to simultaneous temperature increments ( or decrements ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath98 in eqs .",
    "( [ linode - pert ] ) is obtained by substituting @xmath99 for @xmath100 in eqs .",
    "( [ jij ] ) and ( [ jii ] ) .",

    "the difficulty in applying this formula lies in computing @xmath102 , that is , in computing the solutions of the homogeneous equation .",
    "moreover , this computation demands the previous computation of the solution for @xmath91 .    since we are only interested in the stationary solutions of the heat - balance equations rather than in transient thermal states , it is possible to find an expression of these solutions that is more manageable than eq .",

    "equivalently , we have assumed that the perturbation series converges .",

    "the computation of the stationary thermal state with the linear method relies on an explicit integral , eq .  ( [ t_1_lim ] ) , or a fourier expansion , eq .",
    "( [ d_fourier - sol ] ) . given a sampling of the thermal driving function at equal time intervals",
    ", the periodic solution can be obtained through two discrete fourier transforms : a direct transform to get the fourier coefficients of the driving function and an inverse transform of the coefficient vector multiplied by a suitable matrix ( sect .",
    "[ fourier - anal ] ) .",
    "of course , the discrete fourier transforms are best performed with a fft algorithm .",
    "this computation is more efficient than the numerical computation of the integral , eq .  ( [ t_1_lim ] ) , if we need the values of the temperatures at all the given sampling times .",
    "however , the fourier transform presents the gibbs phenomenon , associated with sudden variations of the heat loads , as occur at eclipse times , for example .",
    "the gibbs phenomenon introduces errors , but these errors could be suppressed with special methods .",
    "the computation of the thermal modes and the stationary thermal state for a satellite ten - node thermal model confirms the validity of the linear method for a minimal but realistic model .",
    "the relaxation times span a considerable range , between 55 seconds and nearly one hundred minutes . of course",
    ", the latter time must be almost independent of the particular thermal model used , whereas the former has no intrinsic significance , and , if the number of nodes grew , that time would shrink ( thus further expanding the range of relaxation times ) .",
    "the slowest mode corresponds to node temperature increments with the same sign ( positive by convention ) , whereas the increments corresponding to other modes have both signs .",
    "the periodic variation in the external heat input ( fig .",
    "[ heat - in ] ) excites the thermal modes and produces a definite pattern of stationary temperature oscillations , well approximated by the first - order solution ( fig .",
    "[ tevol ] ) .",
    "the second - order correction is small compared to the first - order solution , but it is worth computing , as it reaches 1.7  k. higher order corrections are essentially negligible , but the error due to the gibbs phenomenon at the eclipse positions reaches 0.6 k ( at the most ) .    focusing on the computational aspects of the linear approach , we have studied how it scales with the number @xmath30 of nodes and the number @xmath29 of sampling positions on the orbit .",
    "if the jacobian matrix is dense , the complexity of the corresponding matrix operations is of order @xmath265 .",
    "it is convenient to employ just one matrix operation , namely , the diagonalization of the jacobian matrix , because then only a few of the slowest modes are needed for the remaining operations , so these have negligible complexity .",
    "the complexity of a direct numerical integration of the nonlinear equations is of order @xmath259 , @xmath23 being the number of time steps necessary for relaxation . for a low - altitude orbit",
    ", @xmath23 is expected to be on the order of one thousand , as for our moon - orbiting satellite .",
    "therefore , the linear method would be computationally effective as just an integration method only for models with a few hundred nodes . at any rate",
    ", the jacobian matrix can be assumed to be sparse , and its conduction part can be assumed to be especially sparse , in addition to being the larger part of the jacobian matrix and also being independent of the orbit . as the orbit may be subjected to changes in the planning of a mission ,",
    "a convenient strategy probably is to diagonalize the conduction part at the outset and , when needed , add the radiation part within some approximation scheme",
    ". this strategy can be far more efficient than integrating the nonlinear equations each time .",
    "moreover , the strength of the linear approach lies with the insight that it provides about the thermal behavior of the spacecraft , as embodied by the decomposition of its thermal modes , of which only the slowest ones are significant .",
    "these significant modes can actually be obtained with a reduced thermal model using few nodes .",
    "therefore , the linear approach is especially useful in the context of reduced models .",
    "furthermore , it provides a method for model reduction based on the mode decomposition : this decomposition can be used to group nodes .",
    "indeed , there is a technique for graph partitioning based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the laplacian matrix of the graph @xcite . according to sect .",
    "[ heur ] , this technique is applicable to the jacobian matrix , but the details of this application are beyond the scope of the present paper and are left for future work .    finally , our linear approach can surely be applied to other cyclic heating processes that involve radiation heat transfer .",
