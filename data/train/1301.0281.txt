    "the primary goal of quantum information processing is to enable performing tasks that are unable to be accomplished classically .",
    "teleportation @xcite is a typical information processing task where at present there is intense activity in extending the experimental frontiers @xcite . at the practical level teleportation",
    "is implemented through the sharing of quantum entanglement by separated parties involving the transmission of quantum particles over large distances .",
    "environmental interaction is a ubiquitous process here , which unless controlled through well - devised means , leads to an inevitable loss of fidelity of the teleported quantum states . depending upon the magnitude of environmental effects",
    ", the fidelity could fall below the maximum limit attainable using classical means , thereby nullifying the quantum advantage of teleportation .",
    "though decoherence is generally responsible for the decay of quantum correlations in entangled states , and the associated loss of fidelity for the corresponding information processing tasks for which such states are utilized as resources , it has been noted that under certain specially chosen conditions , it could also have a reverse effect .",
    "entanglement between two systems could be created or increased by their collective interactions with a common environment @xcite .",
    "applications of such effects in entanglement generation using trapped ions and cavity fields have been suggested @xcite . for the specific case of teleportation",
    "it has been observed that the effect of amplitude damping on one of the qubits of a shared bipartite state could lead to the enhancement of fidelity above the classical limit for a class of states whose fidelity lies just below quantum region @xcite .",
    "however , such an improvement is possible only for low values of the damping parameter , and occurs only for a restricted class of states @xcite .",
    "the preservation of entanglement in open systems is an important concern , and in the present work we will approach this issue from another suggested direction .",
    "recently , the application of weak measurements has been suggested as a practically implementable method for protecting the fidelity of quantum states undergoing decoherence through the amplitude damping channel @xcite .",
    "the original concept of weak measurements proposed several years ago @xcite showed how it would be possible to get an experimental outcome outside the eigenvalue spectrum of an observable , if a sufficiently weak coupling of the system and the apparatus along with the technique of post - selection is employed .",
    "the idea of weak measurements has more recently been utilized in several interesting applications such as demonstration of wave particle duality using cavity - qed experiments @xcite , superluminal propagation of light @xcite , observations of spin hall effect @xcite , trajectories of photons @xcite , direct measurement of the quantum wave function @xcite , and measurement of ultrasmall time delays of light @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this work is to show how the fidelity of teleportation using the resource of two qubits open to amplitude damping environments could be protected with the help of weak measurement . for this purpose",
    "we utilize the technique of weak measurement and its reversal as employed recently in order to exhibit the suppression of the effect of amplitude damping decoherence in preserving the entanglement of two - qubit states @xcite .",
    "we first study maximally entangled two - qubit channels which are the most widely used resources in teleportation , and the effects of amplitude damping on which have been investigated earlier for the purpose of obtaining fidelity greater than @xmath0 without using weak measurement @xcite .",
    "a fidelity below the classical limit of @xmath0 can be obtained with the help of shared randomness . it may be noted that with the help of classical resources it is never possible to exceed the limit of @xmath0 by employing any possible strategy including post - selection @xcite .",
    "we adapt the technique of weak measurement and its reversal in the context of such a setting through the calculation of the optimal strength of weak measurements required in order to maximize the output fidelity .",
    "finally , in order to show that the protocol of improving teleportation fidelity using weak measurement and its reversal is not restricted to the case of pure states , we also present an example of the mixed werner state .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide a brief review of teleportation through two - qubit amplitude damping channels . in section",
    "iii we present our analysis of employing weak measurements in teleportation . as in any protocol involving weak measurement @xcite , the role of post - selection is important here , since it allows one to work with only a sub - ensemble of all the initial states .",
    "our analysis based on such post - selection shows that an average fidelity greater than @xmath0 is attainable for any strength of decoherence for all maximally entangled two qubits if one of them undergoes damping , while such a result holds for a sub - class of maximally entangled two qubits if both of them are affected by decoherence . in section",
    "iv the werner state is considered when both qubits interact with the environment , and it is shown the teleportation fidelity may be enhanced to the quantum region for a large range of the mixing parameter and the strength of decoherence .",
    "we make some concluding remarks in section v.",
    "in quantum teleportation with the help of entanglement the sender ( say , alice ) is able to transfer the unknown quantum state of a qubit to a receiver ( say , bob ) , stationed at a distant location by performing local quantum operations and communicating two bits of classical information to bob .",

    "due to this interaction , the entanglement between the qubits decreases and the maximally entangled state becomes a mixed state @xmath6 . if the fef @xmath16 , the state @xmath6 is useless for the teleportation , as one can achieve the fidelity @xmath0 on average classically .    in ref.@xcite",

    "<S> we employ the technique of weak measurement in order to enable preservation of teleportation fidelity for two - qubit noisy channels . </S>",
    "<S> we consider one or both qubits of a maximally entangled state to undergo amplitude damping , and show that the application of weak measurement and a subsequent reverse operation could lead to a fidelity greater than @xmath0 for any value of the decoherence parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the success probability of the protocol decreases with the strength of weak measurement , and is lower when both the qubits are affected by decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our protocol is shown to work for the werner state too . </S>",
