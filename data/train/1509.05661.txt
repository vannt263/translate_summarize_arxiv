    "in this paper we investigate the @xmath0 regularity of alexandrov solutions to degenerate monge - ampre equations of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a bounded convex domain in @xmath4 .    in the case that @xmath5 also has a positive lower bound",
    ", @xmath0 estimates were first obtained by de philippis and figalli ( @xcite ) .",
    "they showed that @xmath6 is integrable for any @xmath7 .",
    "it was subsequently shown that @xmath8 is in fact @xmath9 for some @xmath10 depending on dimension and @xmath11 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these estimates are optimal in light of two - dimensional examples due to wang ( @xcite ) with the homogeneity @xmath12    these estimates fail when @xmath5 degenerates . in three and higher dimensions , it is not hard to construct solutions to ( @xmath13 ) that have a lipschitz singularity on part of a hyperplane , so the second derivatives concentrate ( see section [ highdim ] )",
    ". however , in two dimensions , a classical result of alexandrov ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) shows that lipschitz singularities of solutions to @xmath14 propagate to the boundary .",
    "thus , in two dimensions solutions to ( @xmath13 ) are @xmath15 and @xmath8 has no jump part . however , this leaves open the possibility that @xmath8 has nonzero cantor part .",
    "the main result of this paper is the construction of a solution to ( @xmath13 ) in two dimensions that is not @xmath0 .",
    "this negatively answers an open problem stated in both ( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) , which was motivated by potential applications to the semigeostrophic equation .",
    "we also prove that singularities that are logarithmically slower than lipschitz propagate , which generalizes the theorem of alexandrov and is optimal by example .",
    "the @xmath0 estimates mentioned above have applications to the global existence of weak solutions to the semigeostrophic equation ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", the density @xmath5 solves a continuity equation that preserves @xmath16 bounds .",
    "this is the only regularity property of @xmath5 that is globally preserved , due to nonlinear coupling between @xmath5 and the velocity field .",
    "it is therefore useful to obtain estimates that depend on @xmath16 bounds for @xmath5 but not on its regularity .",
    "to apply the results in @xcite and @xcite one must assume that @xmath5 is supported in the whole space .",
    "however , in physically interesting cases , the initial density is compactly supported .",
    "it is thus natural to ask what one can show about solutions to ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "our construction shows that , even in two dimensions , one must rely more on the specific structure of the semigeostrophic equation to obtain existence results for compactly supported initial data .",
    "the idea of our construction is to start with a one - dimensional convex function of @xmath17 in the half - space @xmath18 whose second derivative has nontrivial cantor part , and extend to a convex function on @xmath19 which lifts from these values without generating too much monge - ampre measure . to accomplish this we start with a `` building block '' @xmath20 that agrees with @xmath21 in @xmath22 for some @xmath23 , and in the cusp @xmath24 grows with the homogeneity @xmath25 by superposing vertically - translated rescalings of ( a smoothed version of ) @xmath20 in a self - similar way",
    ", we obtain our example .",
    "our main theorem is :    [ main ] for all @xmath26 , there exist solutions to @xmath27 that are not @xmath0 .",
    "it is obvious that solutions to ( @xmath13 ) in one dimension are @xmath28 .    in our examples ,",
    "the support of @xmath5 is irregular . in particular , in the higher - dimensional examples ,",
    "the support of @xmath5 is a cusp revolved around an axis , and in the two - dimensional example , the support of @xmath5 has a very irregular `` fractal '' geometry .    in e.g. @xcite and @xcite",
    "the authors obtain interesting regularity results when @xmath5 degenerates in a specific way , motivated by applications to prescribed gauss curvature .    our second result concerns the behavior of solutions to @xmath27 near a single line segment .",
    "since lipschitz singularities propagate , @xmath8 can not concentrate on a line segment .",
    "( in our two - dimensional counterexample to @xmath0 regularity , @xmath8 concentrates on a family of horizontal rays . ) on the other hand , by modifying an example in @xcite one can construct , for any @xmath29 , a solution to @xmath27 that grows like @xmath30 , with second derivatives not in @xmath31 ( see section [ propagation ] ) .",
    "it is natural to ask whether one can take @xmath32 .",
    "we show that this is not possible .",
    "indeed , we construct a family of barriers that agree with @xmath33 away from arbitrarily thin cusps around the @xmath34 axis , where we can make the monge - ampre measure as large as we like . by sliding these barriers",
    "we prove that singularities of the form @xmath33 propagate .",
    "our second theorem is :    [ logarithmicpropagation ] assume that @xmath35 is convex on @xmath19 and that @xmath14 .",
    "then if @xmath36 and @xmath37 in a neighborhood of the origin for some @xmath38 , then @xmath35 vanishes on the @xmath34 axis .",
    "note that we assume the growth in a neighborhood of @xmath39 . for a lipschitz singularity",
    "it is enough to assume the growth at a point , which automatically extends to a neighborhood by convexity .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for a short proof that lipschitz singularities propagate . )",
    "theorem [ logarithmicpropagation ] shows , after taking a legendre transform , that a solution to @xmath40 in two dimensions can not separate from a tangent plane more slowly than @xmath41 in any fixed direction .",
    "this quantifies the classical result that such functions are strictly convex .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ highdim ]",
    "we construct simple examples of solutions to ( @xmath13 ) in the case @xmath42 which have a lipschitz singularity on a hyperplane . in section [ mainexample ]",

    "this proves theorem [ main ] . in section [ propagation ]",
    "we first construct examples showing that theorem [ logarithmicpropagation ] is optimal .",

    "more precisely , we show :    [ higherdimex ] in dimension @xmath42 , for any @xmath46 there exists a solution to @xmath27 that is a positive multiple of @xmath47 in @xmath48 .",

    "we search for a convex function @xmath50 in @xmath51 , with @xmath23 , that glues `` nicely '' across the boundary to @xmath47 . to that end",

    "the cylindrical coordinates @xmath60 one easily computes @xmath61 for @xmath46 the right hand side is locally bounded .",
    "the bound on @xmath62 can be understood by looking at the gradient map of @xmath35 , which takes a `` ring '' of volume like @xmath63 to a `` football '' of length of order @xmath64 and radius of order @xmath65 ( see figure [ gradmap ] ) . then impose that it decreases volume",
