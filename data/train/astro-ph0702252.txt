    "the self - similar solution is a powerful method to describe flows of a fluid involving strong shock waves . in a supernova ( sn )",
    "explosion , a shock wave propagates in the stellar interior toward the surface .",
    "this process can be regarded as a self - similar problem as long as the density distribution has a power - law profile with respect to the distance from the center or the surface .",
    "in fact , self - similar solutions for this problem have been discovered and widely known ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite discovered a self - similar solution for the emergence of a strong shock wave from a medium with a power - law density distribution , which was first posed by @xcite .",
    "this solution describes distributions of the velocity , pressure and density of the matter with an eulerian coordinate until the shock wave reaches the surface .",
    "after that , the solution uses a lagrangian coordinate .",
    "@xcite invented another description for a whole evolution of this solution with a lagrangian coordinate .",
    "however , these solutions do not completely reflect on the circumstances . in reality ,",
    "thermal energy can be deposited and/or lost across a shock front ( referred to as the energy variation in this paper ) .",
    "for example , some nuclear reactions can take place in the region behind the shock front when the temperature thereof becomes sufficiently high .",
    "this happens in a detonation wave and might be realized in a type ia supernova ( sn ia ) , which is thought to be a thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf . the thermonuclear explosion model for sne ia",
    "was originally proposed by @xcite , and several models for the propagation of the flame front have been discussed , for example , `` deflagration model''(see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ,  delayed detonation model(see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and  pulsating delayed detonation model\"@xcite . in particular , the ( pulsating ) delayed detonation models suggest that the detonation wave is generated somewhere in the outer layer of a white dwarf and propagates toward the surface .",
    "in addition , a carbon detonation model of a white dwarf with the mass of @xmath0 was proposed @xcite for a peculiar sn ia , sn 1990n .",
    "the detonation wave propagates toward the surface also in this model . furthermore",
    ", thermal energy generated behind the shock front can be transported through the front near the stellar surface where the optical depth is close to unity . in this region , photons diffuse out at velocities close to the speed of light , which is larger than the shock velocity . in other words ,",
    "the energy of the shock wave can decrease by the radiative cooling . @xcite calculated the effect of the cooling using a radiation - hydrodynamics code .",
    "this kind of phenomena in some type i sne accelerates a considerable amount of matter to sufficiently high energies to synthesize light elements , li , be , and b through spallation reactions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the solution derived in this paper might be useful to investigate the chemical evolution of light elements in galaxies .",
    "@xcite studied the treatment of the energy variation at the shock front in the frame work of self - similar solutions and showed that it can be treated by modifying the jump conditions at the front to impose the condition that the energy deposition or loss per unit mass be proportional to the internal energy . in real shock acceleration problem , this condition is rarely satisfied . whether the energy is deposited by nuclear reactions or lost by radiation , it tends to have a characteristic energy per nucleon or a characteristic time scale .",
    "thus the self - similarity of the associated flow might appear in very limited space and/or time if any .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we concentrate on the flow called `` chapmann - jouguet detonation '' that satisfies the chapmann - jouguet condition ; the velocity of the gas relative to the shock front is equal to the local velocity of sound .",
    "@xcite showed that this condition can be expressed as the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we review the procedure and apply it to this study .    from the rankine - hugoniot relations ( [ rh1])-([rh3 ] ) ,",
    "the velocity of the gas relative to the shock front is @xmath3 the velocity of sound is @xmath4 equating the right hand sides of equations ( [ cj1 ] ) and ( [ cj2 ] ) , the condition is expressed as @xmath5 using this expression , @xmath6 and @xmath7 in ( [ front ] ) and ( [ sing ] ) are found to take the same value .",
    "this means that the singular point is located at the shock front .",
    "then by equating @xmath8 defined in ( [ varr ] ) at the shock front to that at the singular point , we obtain the analytic expression for @xmath9 as @xmath10 on the other hand , the following relation is derived from equations ( [ profile ] ) and ( [ shockv ] ) ; @xmath11 in c - j detonation , substitution of the relation ( [ cj ] ) yields @xmath12 which is independent of @xmath13 . therefore this relation can be applied to an arbitrary power - law density profile . for a shock wave without energy variation ( @xmath14 ) , substitution of the values in table [ eigen ] yields @xmath15 which is also independent of @xmath13 .",
    "here we consider the situation that @xmath16 .",
    "however the density diverges for the case that @xmath2 is exactly unity . therefore introducing the parameter @xmath17 as @xmath18 we treat the behavior of the eigen value @xmath9 when @xmath17 is close to zero .",
    "[ lim ] shows the behavior in the range of @xmath19 for @xmath20 . in this range ,",
    "the following empirical relations are derived by interpolation ; @xmath21 these formulae suggest that when the shock becomes radiative , the shock velocity tends to be independent of the initial density .",
    "thus the shock is no longer accelerated due to radiative energy loss and propagates at a constant velocity .     as a function of @xmath17 for @xmath20 [ lim ] ]",
    "in this section , we derive the energy spectrum from the asymptotic behavior of physical quantities described above .",
    "the energy spectrum is defined as the mass whose energy is larger than @xmath22 ; @xmath23 from the relation ( [ asym ] ) and @xmath24 , the dependence on @xmath22 is found to be @xmath25 the values of the power - law exponent for various @xmath2 are shown in table [ spec ] . here @xmath1 is assumed to be @xmath26 .",
    "the results for @xmath27 give the upper limit for the exponent , because @xmath2 takes the maximum value for the chapmann - jouguet detonation and then @xmath9 yields the maximum .",
    "the exponents increase as the energy is deposited at the shock front and converge to the upper limit in the chapmann - jouguet detonation . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy loss decreases the exponents and the exponents diverge at @xmath28 related to the situation when all the internal energy is lost at the shock front .",
    "this result implies that the energy distribution of cosmic rays for the case @xmath29 ( energy deposition ) becomes harder than that for the case @xmath14 .",

    "here we consider some applicable limits of this solution .",
    "first , from the comparisons with some numerical simulations , the treatment of the energy variation in this self - similar solution is found to be valid .",

    "second , we consider the behavior of the energy source @xmath48 near the surface , where the total energy per unit mass diverges because its density becomes zero .",
    "simultaneously , the energy source diverges to @xmath49 for the energy deposition / loss .",
    "we assume that the energy deposition is caused by some nuclear reactions .",
    "then the energy generation rate must decrease near the surface , because the density decreases while the shock front accelerates toward the surface .",
    "therefore , this model becomes unrealistic near the surface .",
    "on the other hand , for the energy loss , the situation is realistic . as the total energy diverges",
    ", the energy source also diverges to @xmath31 .",
    "this situation is understood as the radiative diffusion deprives the stellar matter of the diverging energy .",
