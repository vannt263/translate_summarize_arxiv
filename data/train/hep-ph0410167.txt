    "these are uniquely determined by knowledge of selfenergy absorptive parts @xmath3 s ( note @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a fermion mass and we do not address the question of renormalization here ) . in the case of small coupling constant the later functions can be read from the perturbation theory series of feynman graphs . in many practical cases",
    "the use of perturbation theory is not only very useful , but almost unavoidable tool for meaningful predictions in particle physics .    in this paper",
    "we explore the analytical properties of propagators in strong coupling theories where nonperturbative approaches are necessary and we deal with the quantum field models with dynamical mass generation ( dmg ) . for this purpose",
    "we consider no mass term of given field in the lagrangian quantum field theory , but assume nontrivial solution of the mass function . in the case of fermion field , the mass function @xmath6 is conventionally defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is usually called fermion renormalization function .",
    "the identification with the previous definitions ( [ spek]),([sesmek ] ) is straightforward . for a review of strong interacting models with the effect of dmg studied in the context of gap equations",

    "be particle associated with the field can not live on - shell . as an hopeful convincing nonperturbative tool we use the formalism of schwinger - dyson ( gap ) equations and/or certain numerical analysis of some recent lattice qcd data .",
    "recall , the gap equations are exact consequences of quantum theory and they are derivable from the appropriate path integral @xcite .",
    "the theories with phenomenon of dmg play an important role in the particle physics .",
    "first , let us mention the standard model .",
    "there , the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is clearly inherent ( although approximate ) property of light quark sector in qcd , while the tree or bare masses are generated via usual higgs mechanism .",
    "furthermore , as a very tempting alternatives to the sm the technicolors ( or extended technicolors ) models were developed ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "these typically higgsless models do not require non - zero expectation value of scalar field and the electroweak symmetry @xmath9 is broken dynamically .",
    "this is associated with formation of fermion condensates , which is typically driven by a new , possibly non - abelian strong force and hence it reminds global chiral symmetry breaking @xmath10 in @xmath11 quark s qcd sector . having no direct experimental evidence for technicolor scenario the masses of a techniparticles",
    "should be scaled up to ( at least ) several tev . for a possible indirect experimental evidence and",
    "some recent constrains on technifermion models see the papers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us note for completeness here that the role of scalar field and the usual ( but now strong ) yukawa interaction can be reconsidered for this purpose @xcite,@xcite .",
    "further , there is another set of interesting models which suggests the radiative origin of ( at least the lightest ) massive fermions .",
    "the so called zee model @xcite,@xcite assume the existence of an additional scalar @xmath12 doublet with the ordinary lagrangian mass term .",
    "the origin of small neutrino masses should be economically explained as a pure radiative corrections effect that follows from the yukawa coupling constant matrix . regarding contemporary measurements of neutrino mixing the zee model",
    "is still one of attractive models for neutrino mass matrix . in order to enhance the reliability of the model at high energy scale ,",
    "the zee model has been embedded into the supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "on an example of the simple model we review or mention the standard methods usually used in the literature . for this purpose",
    "we choose the model already investigated by bicudo in @xcite .",
    "this is in fact simplification of schwinger - dyson equation for fermion in gauge theory and/or in the yukawa model with the ( nonhermitian ) interaction @xmath13 where only the scalar field mass term @xmath14 is explicitly included in the lagrangian . for further simplification the ultraviolet divergences are not addressed here and the interaction kernel of gap equation is regularized by a pauli - villars term . having the integral kernel finite , we approximate the field renormalization function , @xmath15 in the equations .",
    "then the mass gap equation is a non - linear integral equation for the mass function @xmath6 ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a boson - fermion interacting vertex , @xmath18 is boson propagator with pauli - villars regulator .",
    "the trace is taken over the dirac indices .",
    "boson propagator as well as the vertex @xmath17 satisfy their own schwinger - dyson equations . for the further technical simplification we take them in their bare form , i.e @xmath19 .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking is associated with a nontrivial solution for a mass function @xmath6 .",
    "depending on the details of the model it typically appears above a certain critical value of the coupling @xmath20 , where as usual we denote @xmath21 . hence to solve the problem of dynamical mass generation is nontrivial task since the kernel of eq .",

    "the inverse of propagator becomes complex from the threshold @xmath36 while @xmath37 is a lower boundary of the spectral integral ( [ spek ] ) , i.e the point where the propagator becomes complex .",
    "this is clear contradiction and the unitary equations have no solution in this case .",
    "hence we assume usual following form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a propagator residuum and @xmath5 is a pole mass .",
    "these two propagator characteristics can be selfconsistently determined as follows @xmath40 as the second and in fact most spread technical method of solution we make our calculation in the euclidean space .",
    "in the euclidean formalism the analyticity domain of propagator functions should be the same as in the previous spectral - minkowski treatment . assuming no poles in the first and third quadrants of complex momenta one can deform the integration contour and perform the so - called wick rotation @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fourth component of euclidean momenta @xmath43(and similarly for @xmath44 ) .",
    "choosing then convenient angular parametrization @xmath45 such that @xmath46 one can integrate over all angles which leave us with only one dimensional integral equation for the function @xmath6 @xmath47 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the equation ( [ euclid ] ) can be easily solved numerically by the method of iteration .",
    "assuming uniqueness of the spectral representation for fermion propagator and using the theorem of uniqueness of the analytical continuation we should find that the function @xmath48 obtained as a solution of the unitary equations ( [ ue ] ) must be also the solution of the equation ( [ euclid ] ) for @xmath49 at spacelike momenta .",
    "the disagreement implies the unexpected position of greens functions singularity .",
    "we should stress here that the spectral and the euclidean solutions actually coincide in weak coupling quantum field models with explicit mass presented @xcite .    before the presentation of the results let us mentioned further possible method of solving gap equations in minkowski space .",
    "this is based on a partial neglecting of the time momentum component in the kernel of the equation .",
    "typically only the assumed dominant part of propagator poles is considered .",
    "these and similar approaches were mostly used in the calculation of bound state equation , while for a given model some review can be found in @xcite . however , the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is deeply nonperturbative -strong coupling- phenomenon and we believe it is difficult to have such an approximations under safe control and we do not employ this method .",
    ", ,    in what follows the numerical iteration of the equations offers stable convergent and accurate solutions in both approaches .",
    "we take the boson mass @xmath50 and all the results are scaled in these units in our actual calculations .",
    "the square of the cutoff is @xmath51 . in the euclidean theory such constellation leads to the expected dynamical chiral symmetry for the coupling larger then @xmath52 .",
    "the infrared value of generated mass , say @xmath53 , has a drastic dependence on the coupling constant .",
    "we did not attempted to parametrize this behaviour but recall here the paper @xcite where , within a zero boson mass the authors of @xcite have found the well - known exponential behaviour ( this so called miransky scaling is explicitly shown in the next section ) .",
    "the appropriate results for the function @xmath54 are displayed in fig.1 . in what concerns the behaviour of the mass at ultraviolet",
    ", bicudo @xcite shows that @xmath55 where the fermion condensate is defined as usual @xmath56=gtr s. this power behaviour seems to be confirmed by our numerical analyzes .",
    "unfortunately , this is not what we do observe from the solution of the unitary equations .",
    "first of all let us mentioned that there is no nontrivial critical coupling .",
    "stable solution for the functions @xmath57 @xmath58 , residuum @xmath39 and pole mass @xmath5 is obtained for any non - zero coupling constant @xmath59 . the mass function for spacelike @xmath60",
    "is then calculated through the appropriate dispersion relation and compared with @xmath54 .",
    "these results are added to the fig . 1 for several values of coupling constant .",
    "from this we can see that these two solutions do not agree for the same coupling .",
    "furthermore , the scaling @xmath53 is approximately linear for our would be minkowski solution . also the ultraviolet behaviour differs , the spectral solution for @xmath6 is driven by the first power of the inverse square of momentum , i.e. @xmath61 .",
    "note , the possibility that this is also a solution of ( non - unique for a while ) the gap equation ( [ euclid ] ) has been excluded by simple substitution and comparison .",
    "using analyticity arguments above we can conclude that the structure of correlation functions at the complex momentum plane prohibits naive backward wick rotation @xmath62 and the propagators does not posses naively expected spectral ( lehmann ) representation . here",
    "we stop our discussion and leave the correct minkowski treatment for a future interesting investigation .",
    "considering _ explicitly massive _ electron , the analytical structure of strong coupling qed electron propagator was subject of the initial study @xcite .",
    "it was found that above the certain value of the coupling constant the branch point of the fermion propagator disappears from the real timelike semi - axis .",
    "this was also confirmed by the later author s study made in the paper @xcite .",
    "furthermore , based on the solution of _ unitary equations _ presented in the previous section , it was argued that spectral representation ( [ spek ] ) is absent in these circumstances ( for a further review of various euclidean solutions in qed and for a review of similar spectral techniques see the list of references in @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "it is very interesting fact that the above mentioned value of the coupling is exactly identical with the critical coupling @xmath63 which is true at least in the ladder approximation of schwinger - dyson equation for @xmath64 .",
    "remind at this place the trivial fact that the existence of free particle moving is necessary associated with a presence of propagator pole at some momentum square @xmath65 . hence ,",
    "if no fermion mass term is considered in the lagrangian and simultaneously free massive fermions are expected then the naive perturbative dispersion law @xmath66 must be nontrivially transformed into @xmath67 . here",
    "the gap is naturally identified with the pole mass @xmath68 , which must be a solution of our gap equation .",
    "on the other hand the absence of a real propagator pole could be a hint for a confinement or resonant behaviour .    from the above arguments one can conjecture that the confinement is somehow intimately related with the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . at the introductory section we enumerate several models that propose the dynamical origin of the particles in the nature . clearly , having the leptons unconfined it is desirable to look for an interaction which spawn dmg but avoid a confinement . in a gauge theory",
    ", the behaviour of the running coupling associated with the proposed new strong interaction plays the key role . as an simple example let us consider massless gauge theory where the coupling is not running but is approximated by a constant value . for further simplification",
    "the fermion - antifermion - photon vertex is approximated by the bare vertex @xmath69 . in this so called ladder approximation",
    "the fermion gap equation reads : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a free massless gauge boson propagator in landau gauge .",
    "recall again the most conventional strategy : after the wick rotation and the angular integration the gap equation in euclidean space is formulated : @xmath72 where @xmath73 when studying chiral symmetry breaking and where we have introduced an euclidean cutoff regulator @xmath74 as the upper boundary of euclidean integral .",
    "note that now , contrary to previous case , @xmath15 as the exact solution because of ladder approximation .",
    "like in the previous section the second alternative possibility is to assume spectral representation ( [ spek ] ) and to solve the unitary equation directly in minkowski space .",
    "the evaluation of selfenergy and its absorptive part @xmath75 is straightforward ( for details see for instance @xcite .",
    "note only that the eq .",
    "( [ ue ] ) is exact now since @xmath76 in ladder approximation .    as a first step , mainly due to the pedagogical reasons",
    ", we exhibit the agreement of both mentioned approaches and present solutions for small ( in fact subcritical ) couplings in an explicit chiral symmetry breaking , i.e. for non - zero @xmath77 . for this purpose",
    "we prefer to show the renormalized results obtained by the manner firstly used in the paper @xcite .",
    "the spectral solutions at the time - like regime are displayed in fig.1a .",
    "the maximum cusps in the real parts of dynamical mass function @xmath78 correspond to the thresholds , i.e. to the physical mass of the electron .",
    "the continuous imaginary part of @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 is the result of the solution of unitary equations .",

    "solid line curves represent the euclidean solutions , the dot - dashed lines are the mass functions obtained via spectral treatment . the coupling constants @xmath80 decrease from top to bottom . for completeness note that zero momentum subtraction renormalization scheme was used . at this place",
    "we should stress that only the pole mass , defined as @xmath81 , is the observable ( it should be independent on the gauge and on the renormalization scheme ) .",
    ", ,    in addition we switch off the electron mass in the lagrangian . in the euclidean formalism",
    "the properties of dmg are well known in this model .",

    "the schwinger - dyson equations in unquenched qed have been solved in several papers @xcite .",
    "the results presented here follows the numerical treatment described in @xcite .",
    "what is the timelike behavior ? it was already shown by fukuda&kugo in 1976 @xcite that there is no evidence for the propagator pole in ladder qed .",
    "the function @xmath86 never cuts the zero axis for @xmath87 .",
    "this observation is valid even for explicit chiral symmetry breaking case and it has been confirmed in the paper @xcite again . yet",
    "more , no evidence for solution of our unitary equations at supercritical regime @xmath87 was found ( the same is observed in unquenched case ) .",
    "it is probably strong hint ( but of course not a proof ) for a changes of propagator s analyticity domain and we argue that fermion propagator does not posses usual spectral representation in ladder qed .",
    "we do not investigate the analytical structure of the fermion propagator in ladder qed further .",
    "recall , that one can expect some but not radical influence from vertex corrections which was neglected in our study .",
    "the quantum chromodynamics is the only experimentally studied strongly interacting relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "this non - abelian gauge theory with a gauge group @xmath88 has many interesting properties .",
    "the dynamical spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry explains why the pions are light , identifying them with the pseudo - goldstone bosons associated with the symmetry breaking of the group @xmath89 to @xmath90 ( in flavor space ) .",
    "asymptotic freedom @xcite implies that the coupling constant of the strong interaction decreases in the ultraviolet region . for less than 33/2 quark flavors the qcd at high energy becomes predictable by the perturbation theory .",
    "however , in the infrared region the perturbation theory does not work and non - perturbative techniques have to be applied .",
    "one of the most straightforward non - perturbative approaches is a solution of the gap equations for qcd .",
    "the extensive studies were undertaken for a quark gap equation , based on various model assumptions for a gluon propagator .",
    "these approximate solutions , often accompanied by a solution of the fermion - antifermion bethe - salpeter for meson states , have become an efficient tool for studies of many non - perturbative problems , e.g. , the chiral symmetry breaking , low energy electroweak hadron form factors , strong form factors of exclusive processes , etc ( see reviews @xcite and also recent papers @xcite ) .    however , to take gluons into account consistently is much more difficult than to solve the quark sde alone . at this place we briefly review the symmetry preserving _ gauge invariant _ solution obtained by cornwall two decades ago @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "this is the best published example , in which the behavior of the qcd green s functions in the whole range of minkowski formalism is addressed within the framework of the gap equations .",
    "cornwall reveal the resulting gluon propagator which is gauge invariant by the construction and the gluon form factor does not depend on the gauge fixing parameter , although it was used at the beginning of the author s calculation . in his approach",
    "the green s functions satisfy the naive ward identities which is a direct consequence of _ gauge _ and _ pinch technique _ introduction . for the details",
    "see the original paper @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the resulting gluon propagator can be rather accurately fitted in spacelike regime as @xmath91bg^2ln\\left[\\frac{-q^2 + 4m^2(q^2)}{\\lambda^2}\\right ] \\label{cornwall } \\\\",

    "@xcite studies of the coupled sdes for gluon and ghost propagators in the landau gauge in euclidean space were performed in various approximations . however the non - abelian character of the qcd makes it difficult to convert the momentum sdes into equations for spectral functions .",
    "we were not able to do this yet since the fadeev - popov ghosts have to be included @xcite in a class of lorentz gauges .",
    "the main obstacle is the ghost sr , mainly due to singular behavior at zero momenta ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "hence , instead of solving the sdes the following generalized spectral representation @xmath97 was used @xcite to fit the spectral function to euclidean solutions obtained in recent lattice simulations and in the gap equations formalism for gluon form factor @xmath98 .",

    "inspection by the inverse substitution @xmath133 we reproduce the original gap equations for @xmath134 ( no matter what @xmath6 is , clearly the splitting of @xmath134 to @xmath135 is meaningless here . )",
    "furthermore , one should note that scalar propagator does not posses a real pole but it describes resonance .",
    "due to the behaviour of @xmath98 for momenta around the resonant mass it is much convenient to make a fit for selfenergy function rather them for @xmath98 directly .",
    "the most general dispersion relation reads : @xmath136 where the function @xmath3 should be non - zero from the zero threshold .",
    "clearly fitting @xmath137 we obtain the information about mass function @xmath78 in the full regime of momenta @xmath44 .",
    "the procedure is limited by the efficiency of numerical method which was minimization procedure in our case .",
    "nevertheless it offers rough numerical estimates when used in practice .",
    "having fitted the quantities in ( [ dispfit ] ) we have calculated the scalar propagators at time - like regime . in principle the matrix element of @xmath138 scattering can be read off . in the figure",
    "3b the typical deformed breight - wigner shape of the square of propagator @xmath139 is shown . in this case",
    "the coupling strength is @xmath140 and the obtained resonant mass is @xmath141 with the width @xmath142 .",
    "these dimensionfull variables are scaled in units of @xmath143 .",
    "we have reviewed examples of euclidean quantum field theory models which provides the effect and examine the validity of standard analytical assumptions . especially in the case of yukawa theory and ( strong , ladder ) qed",
    "we have checked whether the known euclidean solutions of schwinger - dyson equations are consistent with the assumed singularity structure of the particle propagators .",
    "contrary to the soft coupling case with the explicit chiral symmetry breaking we have found that the obtained solutions does not posses spectral ( lehmann ) representation .",
    "although we do not recover the propagator singularity structure at all , the observed absence of propagator pole argues that such theories can not describe free particles .    on the other hand",
    ", it is suggested that the strong coupling theory may not be in contradiction with standard ( rather say then correct ) analytical assumptions .",
    "it was shown that the recent lattice data on numerical simulation for gluon propagator can be fitted by dispersion relation with continuous non - positive spectral function . here",
    ", the proposed absence of particle pole at real positive semi - axis of momenta is welcome and is consistent with the confinement and unobservability of free color objects- the gluons .",
    "the mass generation has been studied in the wzm for the first time .",
    "although the majorana fermion remains massless the nontrivial solution for the selfenergy functions of bosons was observed .",
    "we have also shown the evidence for resonant behavior of processes mediated by the scalar @xmath110 and/or pseudoscalar @xmath111 exchanges . from our numerical investigation",
    "it seems very likely that the boson propagators satisfy the spectral representation .",
    "the main results of this paper is proposal of absence of a real particle pole in the quantum field models with strong coupling .",
    "based on the numerical analyzes , the study presented here suggests that when fermion dmg effect appears then the would be particle modes condense or / and they are confined . in the certain analogy with qcd we can assume that only some composite objects -bound states- can freely move in a space .    of course , it is possible that some more realistic models of dynamical electroweak breaking ( and hence mass generation of standard model particles ) suffer from our simple analyzes .",
    "we have ignored particle mixing .",
    "also the existence of soft and strong interacting sectors has not been properly modeled .",
    "the later property is a typical requirement of the technicolors .",
    "then , if the underlying dynamics is so mysterious and allows free particles to receive their masses dynamically then there is a white space in the road map of gap equations .",
    "otherwise we did not obtain the picture which is self - consistent with the recent sophisticated nonperturbative methods .",
    "one hopeful method of such inspection -the spectral technique- is reviewed in this paper .",
