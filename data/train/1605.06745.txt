    "the experiments of high energy collision of heavy ions are carrying out in both relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which are thought to produce a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "efforts to model this plasma using a full quantum field theory have been proved particularly difficult . since it is hard to deal with particles of different colors for different flavors under the gauge invariance and the renormalization , an appropriate approximation theory is needed urgently .",
    "then a series of work has been carried out in effective classical theories @xcite , and summarized in ref.@xcite .    for the problem of particle production , schwinger developed a proper time method to calculate the particle production via tunneling mechanism in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) theory @xcite .",
    "for qed case , dawson and cooper have studied particle production in semiclassical approach based on a boltzmann - vlasov ( b - v ) transport equation with an instantaneous source term @xcite and compared the b - v results with numerical simulations of the full quantum treatment . we have also made some researches on the relevant pair production problem in qed case . for instances",
    ", we examined carefully the effects of laser pulse envelop shape and carrier phases on produced pairs @xcite .",
    "also recently we studied the nonperturbative signatures on particle momentum spectra of pair production by solving the quantum vlasov equation or in the dirac - heisenberg - wigner formalism , especially for general elliptic polarized fields @xcite . on the other hand , naturally , the problem of particle production is expected to be extended to the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) case . for example , the soft - gluon production @xcite and the quark - antiquark production @xcite in a constant chromoelectric background field were studied by nayak and his coauthor .",
    "recently , dawson , mihaila and cooper have researched this problem in which the backreaction effects is included @xcite .",
    "they had also studied the casimir dependence of transverse distribution in non - abelian particle production @xcite .",
    "similar work in the su(2 ) case has also been carried out by skokov and leva by using the wigner function formalism @xcite .",
    "although it is important to study the final momentum distribution or the energy spectrum , it seems also necessary and meaningful to study the process of the non - abelian particle production for a better understanding of particle production dynamics . for qed case there",
    "exist such studies @xcite .",
    "for qcd case , however , there is still lacking of corresponding studies . in this paper , therefore , we try to fill the gap while it is a little primary study",
    ". we will study the process of particle production in classical way by using the b - v equation .",
    "meanwhile the wong s equations in ref.@xcite are used as motion equations of classical colored point particles . since the non - abelian particle production is related to the casimir invariants",
    ", we will give the distribution of particle production on color charge @xmath0 sphere in su(2 ) case .",
    "and we will discuss the evolution of the distribution in different background fields .",
    "finally , we will give the total number of particle production .",
    "for simplicity we treat the particles as point particles with classical color and the backreaction effect is ignored since its effect is an order lower than the background field @xcite under the assumption of low density approximation .",
    "note that in the realistic situation the collision effect should be taken into account .",
    "however , in our work , a simplicity or / and lacking of enough reality of the model , in our classical calculation , the pre - production process we found , which is our main point , is still exhibiting some interesting features .",
    "and we think it is helpful to deep the understandings of relevant problem . on the other hand we will also use the schwinger source when introducing different fields as in ref.@xcite since that the field can be regards as varying slowly enough .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "we introduce the wong s equation in semiclassical transport theory . in sec .",
    "we give the definition of distribution function with the measures in phase space . in sec .",
    "we derive the b - v equation and introduce a classical source term . in sec .",
    "we give the numerical methods and numerical results in a special case . and in the final section",
    ", we summarize our numerical results and give the conclusions . by the way in appendix",
    ", we give some derivation of the wong s equations and the solution of the b - v equation by using the method of characteristics .",
    "a theory describing the yang - mills ( ym ) field and isotopic - spin - carrying particles in classical limit has been derived by wong in ref.@xcite . within microscopic description ,",
    "the trajectories in space are known exactly , which read as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a general ym field and satisfies @xmath3 after some approximation and introducing the proper time @xmath4 for particles , the equations read @xmath5 the equations are just made replacement by @xmath6 , and will be used as the leading order of motions for point particles in soft gauged fields .",
    "to describe the ensemble of particles in phase space , it is convenient to define distribution function which depend on whole set of coordinates , @xmath7 . here , we introduce the one - particle distribution function @xmath8 and @xmath9 , then the color current density energy - momentum tensor and particle number density are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 are momentum measure and su(2 ) group measure which constraint the mass on - shell condition , positive energy and conservation of the group casimirs . and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are parameters related to particles and their representations . here , different from that in ref.@xcite , we just define one distribution function for both particles and antiparticles in su(2 ) gauge , which are distinguished by color charge @xmath0 . from wong s equations in su(2 ) case we can write @xmath0 in spherical coordinates @xmath14 and we can find that @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 in refs.@xcite .",
    "the b - v equation can be derived by considering the total derivative of the distribution function @xmath8 . considering the proper time @xmath4 we have @xmath18((\\tau)f(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q})\\label{eq17},\\ ] ] where @xmath19((\\tau)=\\mathcal{d}_\\mu [ \\mathbf{a}]-g\\mathbf{q}\\cdot \\mathbf{f}_{\\mu\\nu}(\\tau)\\partial_{p_\\nu}$ ] is",
    "the the b - v differential operator with @xmath20 = \\partial_\\mu - g \\mathbf{a}(\\tau)\\cdot \\mathbf{q}\\times \\partial_\\mu$ ] is a color - covariant derivative operator .",
    "so now requiring that @xmath21 to be on - shell and @xmath0 satisfies the casimir relation , the b - v equation is given by @xmath22(\\tau)f(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q})=p^t \\mathbf{c}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q})\\label{eq18}.\\ ] ] here we ignore the collision effects , and @xmath23 is a source term . inserting eqs.([eq6])-([eq8 ] ) into eq.([eq17 ] )",
    ", the b - v equation becomes @xmath24      by using one - loop approximation of the quantum field theory , the particle production rate for fermions @xcite is @xmath25\\label{eq20},\\ ] ] where the @xmath26 is the mass of the quark and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the gauge invariant eigenvalues .",
    "all these calculations are based on the schwinger tunneling effect in a constant chromoelectric field .    for classical particle production we can make replacement by @xmath30 and replace the sum by integration @xmath0 as in ref.@xcite .",
    "for a chromoelectric field which is varying slowly we can also get a @xmath0-dependent particle production rate @xmath31 which is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35)]\\label{eq24}.\\ ] ] here the @xmath36 is the special distribution function which is defined as @xmath37 .",
    "it is noted that most of the particle production occurs at @xmath38 by the pauli - blocking at @xmath39 .",
    "in this section we give the numerical methods and results . to simplify the calculation , we choose the gauged potential @xmath40 in @xmath41 direction depending only on @xmath42 for all @xmath43 which read as @xmath44 to calculate the distribution of particle production on the @xmath0 sphere , we should solve the trajectory equations numerically for the distribution function . since no particles produced at @xmath45 , we set @xmath46 .",
    "we ignore the pauli - blocking effects in our calculation and set @xmath47 and use the unit of @xmath48 .",
    "we only consider the particles created with zero momentum of @xmath41 , then the initial conditions are given as @xmath49 for the non - abelian gauged vector potential we set @xmath50 at the beginning .",
    "we calculate both constant and cosine chromoelectric fields after giving their amplitude @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and we appropriately choose the constant fields equal their amplitude and the frequency of cosine fields is @xmath53 in unit of @xmath48 .",
    "sphere in a constant chromoelectric field at different time .",
    "the color bar has been multiplied by @xmath54.,width=566 ]     sphere in constant chromoelectric fields at @xmath55 for different field amplitude of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively .",

    "the field amplitudes @xmath62 with @xmath63 to @xmath64 are the same as in fig.[fig2].,width=453 ]    we distribute the color charges on a @xmath0 sphere , and comprehend it as the non - abelian interaction acts when @xmath0 moves on the sphere with the wong s equations .",
    "we take each degree of @xmath65 and @xmath66 on @xmath0 sphere and calculate the produced particle number density as time goes on .",
    "we take @xmath67 , and choose @xmath68 to guarantee the production occurs in the light cone .",
    "also we fix the @xmath0 at each step to guarantee the wong s equations wo nt be violated .    after solving the trajectory equations numerically , finding the distribution function",
    ", we can integrate out the produced particle number density @xmath9 . and especially for su(2 )",
    "case we can distribute color charges on the @xmath0 sphere , and use @xmath65 and @xmath66 as two parameters to show the distribution of produced particle number density in contour maps .    in our calculation , we find that the number density distributes into two islands on @xmath0 sphere . which we regard it as a pair of conjugate particles . and the distribution on the islands is center - symmetrical",
    ". then we will concentrate on describing the phenomena on one island .    in fig.[fig1 ] , the distribution of number density is centered on the island at the beginning .",
    "and distribution center splits into two parts which go to each edge of the island as the time goes on .",
    "the distribution becomes steady when the time is long enough . in fig.[fig2 ] , we find that the steady state , the distribution could reach , is related to the amplitude of the fields . in small amplitude field",
    "the center wo nt split at all , but the split occurs when the amplitude become larger . and the two parts of the center distribute more closely to the edge as the amplitude of the field increases .    in fig.[fig3 ]",
    ", we can also find the same phenomenon in a slow varying field .",
    "the difference is that fluctuation structure appears in the contour map as the time goes on . and",
    "compared to the constant field , the split two parts are closer to the edge when they reach the steady state .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows the contour maps in cosine fields of different amplitude , it gives the same results from the constant field except the delicate fluctuation structure exists .",
    "our calculation on time is lasted to @xmath69 , but we just show the contour maps which describe the splitting process of distribution center . in our calculation on time , we also find that the two parts of split distribution center are close to the edge , but never escape from the island .",
    "the calculation in fields of different amplitude also shows the confinement character . from fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig4 ] , it seems that there is a critical amplitude which leads to the distribution center splitting .",
    "since it is hard to define the splitting strictly in classical calculation , we just choose some discrete amplitudes .    in fig.[fig5 ]",
    ", we show the total particle number evolution .",
    "we find that the total particle number increases quicker in constant field than in cosine field when @xmath70 , but slower when @xmath71 .",
    "compare fig.[fig5 ] with fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig3 ] , we find that the distribution reach the steady state quicker but the total particle number in constant field is less than that in cosine field .    in fig.[fig6",
    "] , we show the total particle number in fields of different amplitude at @xmath55 , which is long enough to form a steady distribution on @xmath0 sphere .",
    "we find that the total particle number increases at first but then decreases as the amplitude grows in both of constant and cosine field .",
    "and we find the most total particle number is in @xmath72 field , the least total particle number is in @xmath73 field , but the distribution center splits inconspicuously in @xmath72 field , conspicuously in @xmath73 field .",
    "we can also find the total particle number in constant fields is lesser than that in cosine fields when the same amplitudes are given .",
    "by calculating the distribution of particle production on @xmath0 sphere , it is interesting to find that the distribution of particle number density is on two islands and has a movement on @xmath0 sphere as it evolutes .",
    "the distribution is centered at the beginning , splits into two parts which go to each edge of the islands , and reaches a steady state at last .",
    "we comprehend it as a pre - production process in classical describing , which means we could comprehend the non - abelian production dose not occur immediately but there is a process . and we regard the two center - symmetrical islands as the color charge space of conjugated particles . from our calculation , we also find that the distribution can reach , is related to the amplitude and the varying of fields in space - time .",
    "the other important aspect is the pauli - blocking effects which is not included in present work .",
    "in fact we have made some calculation for the problem by including the pauli - blocking effects and it is found that the similar pre - production process exist .",
    "certainly the difference of results quantitatively between two cases of with and without pauli - blocking effect is worthy to study further .    for future work",
    ", it seems necessary to define the splitting in a proper way , and find the value of the critical amplitude which leads to the splitting .",
    "meanwhile , extending the problem to su(3 ) case and making the comparison with quantum field theoretic results are also important and requirement .",
    "this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( nsfc ) under grant no",
    ". 11475026 .",
    "the computation was carried out at the hscc of the beijing normal university .",
    "to simplify the formalism , we choose a gauge and require the field @xmath40 in @xmath41 direction depending only on @xmath42 for all @xmath74 , which read as @xmath75 we can easily find the non - vanishing field terms when @xmath76 or @xmath77 which give @xmath78 from eq.([eq5 ] ) , the non - vanishing terms are @xmath79 writing these equations in vector notation @xmath80 and from these eqs.([eqa5])-([eqa7 ] ) we have @xmath81 inserting these equations into eqs.([eq6])-([eq8 ] ) , the wong s equation can be obtained as @xmath82 by a dot product with @xmath83 in eq.([eqa13 ] ) we could easily get @xmath84 is a conserved quantity . and by a dot product with @xmath85 in eq.([eqa13 ] ) we have @xmath86 reminding that @xmath87 then eq.([eqa12 ] ) can be written as a total derivative @xmath88=0\\label{eqa16},\\ ] ] so that @xmath89 is a constant of motion .",
    "we could solve the b - v equation by using the method of characteristics . integrate the source over a classical particle path trajectory from @xmath90 to @xmath4 , and require the field in @xmath41 direction and take @xmath91 distribution only , then the distribution function @xmath92 reads as @xmath93 here @xmath94 are the solutions of the trajectory equations for values between @xmath90 and @xmath4 where the path length is real and @xmath95 , which means the integration is in the light cone as the time goes on . since no particles present at @xmath45 so @xmath96 and eq.([eqb1 ] ) becomes @xmath97 inserting the classical source term ,",
