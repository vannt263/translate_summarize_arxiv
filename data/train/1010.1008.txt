    "transiting exoplanets ( teps ) are tremendously useful objects for studying the properties of planets outside of the solar system because their photometric transits , combined with precise measurements of the radial velocity variations of their host stars , enable determinations of their masses and radii . of",
    "the @xmath17 confirmed teps discovered to date , all but five are saturn or jupiter - size gas giant planets with masses above @xmath18@xmath9 .",
    "the five teps below this limit , including the super - earths corot-7b ( @xmath19@xmath9 , @xmath20@xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and gj  1214b ( @xmath21@xmath9 , @xmath22@xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , hat - p-11b ( @xmath25@xmath9 , @xmath26@xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and kepler-4b ( @xmath27@xmath9 , @xmath28@xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are likely composed primarily of elements heavier than hydrogren and helium , and are therefore assumed to be qualitatively different from the more massive gas giants .",
    "in addition to these five teps , the candidate tep kepler-9d has an estimated radius of @xmath29@xmath30  @xcite , and is most likely a low - mass planet @xcite , but currently lacks a mass determination .    while the gas giant planets exhibit a wide range of radii at fixed mass ( and hence a great diversity in their physical structure at fixed mass )",
    ", the low mass teps , together with the six solar system planets smaller than saturn , appear to follow a nearly monotonic relation between mass and radius .",
    "the two super - neptunes with precise radius measurements ( gj  436b and hat - p-11b ) have radii that are similar to one another ( to within 15% ) as well as to uranus ( @xmath31@xmath9 , @xmath32@xmath11 ) and neptune ( @xmath33@xmath9 , @xmath34@xmath11 ) .",
    "while the mass and radius of kepler-4b given in the discovery paper @xcite are similar to those of gj  436b and hat - p-11b , a reanalysis by @xcite finds that the radius may be @xmath35% larger , though with a @xmath36 uncertainty , it may still be similar to the other super - neptunes .",
    "the lack of significant scatter in the radii among uranus , neptune , and the super - neptunes is perhaps surprising given the vast range of radii permitted by theoretical structure models for planets in this mass range .",
    "for example , the theoretical models by @xcite predict that a @xmath37 nonirradiated neptune - mass planet may have a radius that ranges from 0.14@xmath11 ( pure iron composition ) to 0.29@xmath11 ( pure water ice composition ) or 0.86@xmath11 ( pure gas composition ) .",
    "these same models also predict that the radii of gas - dominated neptune - mass planets should be far more sensitive to stellar irradiation than those of jupiter - mass planets .",
    "for example , a @xmath38 pure hydrogen - helium neptune - mass planet at @xmath39au has a radius of @xmath40@xmath11 compared to @xmath41@xmath11  for a similarly irradiated jupiter - mass planet .    in this paper",
    "we present the discovery of hat - p-26b , a tep orbiting the relatively bright star gsc  0320 - 01027 with a mass similar to that of neptune , but with a radius of @xmath42@xmath11  or 65% larger than that of neptune .",

    "we describe the analysis of the data , beginning with the determination of the stellar parameters , continuing with a discussion of the methods used to rule out nonplanetary , false positive scenarios which could mimic the photometric and spectroscopic observations , and finishing with a description of our global modeling of the photometry and radial velocities .",
    "our findings are discussed in .",
    "the transits of hat - p-26b were detected with the hat-5 and hat-6 telescopes in arizona , and with the hat-8 and hat-9 telescopes in hawaii .",
    "two regions around gsc  0320 - 01027 , corresponding to fields internally labeled as 376  and 377 , were both observed on a nightly basis between 2009 jan and 2009 aug , whenever weather conditions permitted . for field 376",
    "we gathered 11,500 exposures of 5 minutes at a 5.5 minute cadence .",
    "approximately 1500 of these exposures were rejected by our photometric pipeline because they yielded poor photometry for a significant number of stars .",
    "each image contained approximately 17,000 stars down to sloan @xmath44 .",
    "for the brightest stars in the field , we achieved a per - image photometric precision of 4mmag . for field 377",

    "we achieved a similar photometric precision for the brightest stars in this field .",
    "the calibration of the hatnet frames was carried out using standard photometric procedures .",
    "the calibrated images were then subjected to star detection and astrometry , as described in @xcite .",

    "this includes spectroscopic observations at relatively modest facilities to establish whether the transit - like feature in the light curve of a candidate might be due to astrophysical phenomena other than a planet transiting a star .",
    "many of these false positives are associated with large radial - velocity variations in the star ( tens of @xmath53 ) that are easily recognized .    to carry out this reconnaissance spectroscopy",

    "this instrument provides high - resolution spectra which , with even modest signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios , are suitable for deriving rvs with moderate precision ( @xmath54@xmath53 ) for slowly rotating stars .",
    "we also use these spectra to estimate effective temperatures , surface gravities , and projected rotational velocities of the target star . using the medium fiber on tres , we obtained two spectra of hat - p-26  on the nights of 2009 dec 26 and 2009 dec 27 .",

    "given the significant transit detection by hatnet , and the encouraging tres results that rule out obvious false positives , we proceeded with the follow - up of this candidate by obtaining high - resolution , high - s / n spectra to characterize the rv variations , and to refine the determination of the stellar parameters .",
    "for this we used the hires instrument @xcite on the keck  i telescope located on mauna kea , hawaii , between 2009 dec and 2010 june .",

    "* ) , we conclude that the drift is real with 96.6% confidence , making this a @xmath512 detection . while the detection is not significant enough for us to be highly confident that there is at least one additional body in the system , this suggestive result implies that hat - p-26  warrants long - term rv monitoring .",
    "we also searched for a linear time - shift in the rvs due to potential trojans .",
    "we do not detect a significant shift , and may exclude @xmath513d with 95% confidence .",
    "this translates to an upper limit of @xmath514@xmath15  on the mass of a trojan companion , which is greater than the mass of the planet . with the present data we are thus not able to place a meaningful limit on the presence of trojan companions .",
    "hat - p-26  has a number of features that make it an attractive target for potential follow - up studies . at @xmath515 ,",
    "it is bright enough that precision spectroscopic and photometric observations are feasible with moderate integration times .",
    "the equatorial declination of @xmath46 also means that hat - p-26  is accessible to both northern and southern ground - based facilities .",
    "the exceptionally low jitter will facilitate further rv observations , which might be used to confirm and refine the eccentricity determination , to measure the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( r - m ; discussed in more detail below ) and to search for additional planets in the system .",
    "a detection of the occultation of hat - p-26b  by hat - p-26  with irac/ _ spitzer _ would provide a strong constraint on @xmath516 , while the duration of the occultation would provide a constraint on @xmath322 .",
    "we note that the median value of the _ a posteriori _",
    "distribution for the time of occultation that results from our global fit when the eccentricity is allowed to vary ( ) is @xmath517h after the expected time of occultation assuming a circular orbit .",
    "the expected depth of the occultation event is a challenging @xmath518 and @xmath519 at 3.6  and 4.5  respectively .",
    "scaling from tres-4 , a somewhat fainter star at these wavelengths , for which @xcite measured occultations at 3.6  and 4.5  using irac/_spitzer _ with precisions of @xmath520 and @xmath521 respectively , one may hope to achieve a @xmath522 and @xmath523 detection for hat - p-26b  for one event at each bandpass .",
    "one would need to observe 5 and 4 occultations respectively to achieve a @xmath304 detection .",
    "recent measurements of the r - m effect for teps have revealed a substantial population of planets on orbits that are significantly misaligned with the spin axes of their host stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite note that misalignment appears to be more prevalent for planets orbiting stars with @xmath524k , and suggest that most close - in planets migrate by planet - planet or planet - star scattering mechanisms , or by the kozai effect , rather than disk migration , and that tidal dissipation in the convective surfaces of cooler stars realigns the stellar spin axis to the orbital axis of the close - in massive planet . @xcite",
    "also finds evidence that planets orbiting stars with @xmath525@xmath4  are more likely to be misaligned than planets orbiting cooler stars using a method that is independent of the r - m measurements .",
    "one prediction of the @xcite hypothesis is that lower mass planets orbiting cool stars should show a greater degree of misalignment than higher mass planets due to their reduced tidal influence .",
    "the detection of misalignment for hat - p-11b @xcite is consistent with this hypothesis . measuring the r - m effect for hat - p-26b  would provide an additional test .",
    "using equation ( 40 ) from @xcite , the expected maximum amplitude of the r - m effect for hat - p-26b  is @xmath526@xmath244 , which given the low jitter of hat - p-26 , should be detectable at @xmath527 .    by measuring the primary transit depth as a function of wavelength it is possible to obtain a transmission spectrum of an exoplanet s atmosphere .",
    "such observations have been made for a handful of planets ( e.g.  @xcite ; see also the review by @xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite , the expected difference in transit depth between two wavelengths is given approximately by : @xmath528 where @xmath529 is the scale height of the atmosphere , @xmath530 is the planet surface gravity , @xmath531 is the mean molecular weight of the atmosphere , and @xmath532 where @xmath533 and @xmath534 are the opacities per gram of material at wavelengths in a strong atomic or molecular line and in the nearby continuum respectively . assuming a pure h@xmath535 atmosphere , @xmath536 kg",
    ", we find for hat - p-26b  @xmath537 km , and @xmath538 .",
    "if instead we assume that the atmosphere has the same composition as neptune ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have @xmath539 kg , @xmath540 km , and @xmath541 . for comparison , assuming a pure h@xmath535 atmosphere , the planet hd  209458b has @xmath542 , while gj  436b has @xmath543 , hat - p-11b has @xmath544 and kepler-4b has @xmath545 . due to its low surface gravity , hat - p-26b  easily has the highest expected transmission spectrum signal among the known transiting neptune - mass planets .",
    "while it is relatively faint compared to the well studied planets hd  209458b and hd  189733b , we note that @xcite used the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) to detect a @xmath546 absorption level at 7582  due to potassium in the atmosphere of xo-2b , which orbits a @xmath547 early k star . scaling from this observation",
    ", it should be possible to detect components in the atmosphere of hat - p-26b  with @xmath548 at the @xmath549 level using the gtc .      in summary ,",
    "hat - p-26b  is a low - density neptune - mass planet .",
    "its low - density relative to the other known neptune - mass planets means that hat - p-26b  likely has a more significant hydrogen - helium gas envelope than its counterparts .",
    "the existence of hat - p-26b  provides empirical evidence that , like hot jupiters , hot neptunes also exhibit a wide range of densities . comparing to the @xcite models , we find that hat - p-26b  is likely composed of a gas envelope and a heavy - element core that are approximately equal in mass , while the @xcite models prefer a higher heavy - element fraction .",
    "it is also likely that irradiation - driven mass - loss has played a significant role in the evolution of hat - p-26b  we find that the planet may have lost @xmath550 of its present - day mass over the course of its history , though this conclusion depends strongly on a number of very poorly constrained parameters , particularly the xuv flux of hat - p-26  and its evolution in time .",
    "we place a 95% confidence upper limit on the eccentricity of @xmath509 .",
    "if further observations detect a nonzero eccentricity , it would mean that at least three of the four known neptune - mass teps have nonzero eccentricities , which may imply that the tidal quality factor is higher than expected for these planets .",
    "observations of the planetary occultation event for hat - p-26b  with irac/_spitzer _ would greatly constrain the eccentricity , however the low expected depth is likely to make this a challenging observation .",
    "we find suggestive evidence for a linear drift in the rvs which is significant at the @xmath512 level .",
    "if confirmed , this would imply the existence of at least one additional body in the hat - p-26  system . with an expected r - m amplitude of @xmath551@xmath244  and a low stellar rv jitter ,",
    "hat - p-26b  is a good target to measure the r - m effect and thereby test the hypothesis that low - mass planets are more likely to be misaligned than high - mass planets .",
    "the low surface gravity also makes hat - p-26b  a good target for transmission spectroscopy .",
