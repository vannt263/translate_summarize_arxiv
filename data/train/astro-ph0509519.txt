    "the success of milgrom s mond paradigm ( milgrom 1983 ) in explaining the shapes of disk galaxy rotation curves , and correlations between the parameters of such systems ( e.g. tully - fisher law ) with no appeal to dark haloes is by now well known  for a modern review see sanders & mcgaugh ( 2003 ; henceforth s&mcg ) .",
    "this nonrelativistic scheme is summed up by a novel relation between acceleration @xmath1 of each element of an extragalactic system and the local newtonian field @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 , and the @xmath5 function interpolates between @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is this last proviso which guarantees correspondence of mond with newtonian gravity in the laboratory or the solar system , both of which are supra @xmath9 situations .",
    "mond lends itself to reformulation as a gravitational field theory alternative to newton s . in this lagrangian based theory , named aqual ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ; henceforth b&m ) ,",
    "the poisson equation is replaced by @xmath10=4\\pi g\\rho , \\label{aqual}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 the physical gravitational potential ( so that @xmath12 ) . in spherically",
    "symmetric situations eq .  ( [ aqual ] ) has eq .",
    "( [ mond ] ) as a unique solution .",
    "but when symmetry is lower , an extra term appears on the r.h.s .",
    "it is this corrected mond equation which is to be used in place of eq .",
    "( [ mond ] ) : deriving as it does from a lagrangian , it guarantees that momentum , energy and angular momentum will be conserved in mond dynamics .",
    "the original mond formula failed to assure this .",
    "aqual has a number of further advantages over plain mond ( b&m , s&mcg ) .",
    "aqual is thus a fruitful tool for exploring non dark matter ( dm ) resolutions of the missing mass problems .",
    "but it has shortcomings .",
    "for example , like the naive mond formula , it fails to do away with the need for dm in clusters of galaxies , although its requirements for the dark stuff are certainly lower than in newtonian gravity . and",
    "since it is basically nonrelativistic , aqual is unable to address a number of key subjects with relativistic overtones : gravitational lensing , cosmological evolution and the growth of structure , to name a few . how to cast the mond idea in a relativistic mold while retaining the benefits of aqual ?",
    "a relativistic version of aqual ( call it raqual ) was offered in its defining paper ( b&m ) .",
    "the basic idea was to replace the physical potential @xmath11 by a scalar field @xmath13 whose equation is a relativistic reflection of eq .",
    "( [ aqual ] ) .",
    "this equation is written on a metric @xmath14 obeying einstein s equations ( with a contribution to the energy momentum tensor from @xmath13 ) .",
    "one then defines the physical metric as @xmath15 this last describes a spacetime which has been locally stretched in every direction with respect to that described by @xmath14 .",
    "all matter and radiations are supposed to sense only @xmath16 , and the requisite equations must contain only @xmath16 and never @xmath14 by itself .",
    "raqual reproduces nonrelativistic aqual , and so recovers much of the successful mond phenomenology .",
    "however , raqual fails on two counts .",
    "it permits superluminal propagation of @xmath13 waves ( b&m ) . and",
    "it is unable to give an account of gravitational lensing in agreement with the basic observation that lensing by galaxy clusters is anomalously strong compared to what was to be expected in view of their galaxies and gas content .",
    "this last problem is rooted in the conformal relation ( [ conf ] ) between the einstein and physical metrics .",
    "conformally related metrics share the same tracks for photons ( or electromagnetic wave packets ) . and",
    "because @xmath13 s contribution to the source of einstein s equations is weak in clusters of galaxies , the metric relevant for lensing in raqual is nearly that in gr with no dm .    breaking",
    "the conformal relation has been the central theme in attempts to fix this problem .",
    "for example , it is possible to add to eq .",
    "( [ conf ] ) the symmetric tensor @xmath17 multiplied by some scalar ( bekenstein & sanders 1994 ) .",
    "it turns out that in order for gravitational waves ",
    "perturbations of @xmath14to propagate causally , i.e. within the light cone of @xmath16 , the mentioned scalar factor must be negative , and it is then found to _ weaken _ gravitational lensing , rather than enhancing it as intended .    a way out of the _ impasse _ ( sanders 1997 ) is to introduce a constant vector field which points in the time direction , and then to stretch spacetime along the vector by a factor @xmath18 while shrinking it by the same factor orthogonally to the vector .",
    "this does the trick : provided the scalar field @xmath13 used comes from a raqual - type equation , mond phenomenology is recovered while the lensing is augmented to the right proportions .",
    "however , this `` stratified '' theory is not covariant ( one needs the vector to be in the time direction , and this can not be true in all coordinate systems ) .",
    "covariance of equations of a physical theory is so ingrained in modern physics that we have to look further .",
    "is a tensor - vector - scalar covariant field theory ( bekenstein 2004 ; henceforth b04 ) incorporating various motifs already mentioned . just as in raqual ,",
    "the tensor is an einstein metric @xmath14 out of which is built the standard einstein - hilbert action .",
    "one passes to the physical metric as in the stratified theory , but now using an everywhere timelike _",
    "dynamical _ normalized vector field @xmath19 . in equations",
    "@xmath20 together with the normalization requirement @xmath21 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath19 is dictated by the action @xmath22 } { \\cal u}_{[\\beta,\\nu ] } -2(\\lambda / k)(g^{\\mu\\nu}{\\cal u}_\\mu { \\cal u}_\\nu + 1)\\big](-g)^{1/2 } d^4 x , \\label{vector_action}\\ ] ] where the square brackets denote antisymmetrization . the @xmath23 here is a _",
    "dimensionless _ coupling constant , one of the parameters of the theory .",
    "the @xmath24 is a lagrange multiplier field included to enforce the normalization of the vector field ; @xmath24 is to be determined as the equations are solved .",
    "the kinetic part of @xmath25 is that of an abelian gauge field , but the unit norm constraint deprives @xmath19 of the proverbial gauge freedom . in addition , @xmath19 is not coupled to a current of any sort , so it would be incorrect to view the vector as mediating a repulsive coulomb - like force .    the dynamical scalar field @xmath13 required in eq .  ( [ metric ] )",
    "is assigned the action @xmath26(-g)^{1/2 } d^4 x , \\label{scalar}\\ ] ] which involves an auxiliary _ nondynamical _ scalar field @xmath27 , a new dimensionless parameter , @xmath28 , a scale parameter , @xmath29 , and an unspecified function @xmath30 . in the kinetic part of @xmath31 ,",
    "@xmath32 is contracted not with @xmath33 , but with the tensor @xmath34 ; this is introduced to cope with the problem of superluminal propagation of scalar perturbations evidenced by raqual . with @xmath35 the propagation",
    "is found to be subluminal with respect to the physical metric on condition that @xmath36 ( b04 ) .",
    "contrary to appearances , @xmath31 is not a quadratic action .",
    "first @xmath37 must be expressed in terms of @xmath38 by varying @xmath31 with respect to @xmath37 , and inverting the resulting equation . when the result is substituted in both terms of @xmath31 ,",
    "the action becomes aquadratic in @xmath38 , resembling raqual s action , with the scalar @xmath39 replacing @xmath40 .",
    "the form ( [ scalar ] ) is , however , more convenient for calculation .",
    "these pieces of the total action must be supplemented with the matter action @xmath41 . in accordance with the einstein equivalence principle ( will 1993 ) it",
    "must be formed by replacing @xmath42 everywhere in the matter action in use in general relativity ( gr ) , and modifying all covariant derivatives accordingly . in this way",
    "all types of matter respond to gravitational fields in the same way , and it could be said that matter and radiation delineate the physical metric . now because @xmath16 contains @xmath13 as well as @xmath19 , the variations of the total action with respect to these quantities engender variations of @xmath41 which create sources for the equations of @xmath13 and @xmath19 . no direct coupling of these fields to the matter variables is thus required , which is pleasant as no principles are evident for determining such couplings .    is t@xmath0v@xmath0s unique ?",
    "not at all .",
    "for example , one could choose to write @xmath31 and @xmath25 with @xmath16 instead of @xmath14 .",
    "the present approach seems preferable in that evidently @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath19 are all gravitational fields , so their actions should not involve the `` matter s metric '' @xmath16 .",
    "further , one could add to @xmath31 a kinetic term for @xmath27 such as is included in phase coupled gravity ( pcg ) , a theory devised in a partially successful attempt to forestall superluminal propagation ( bekenstein 1986 , 1990 ) .",
    "in addition one could redefine @xmath35 as @xmath43 ( @xmath44 should be positive but not small in order to obviate superluminality ; it could be a constant ) .",
    "an additional freedom is the choice of function @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ scalar ] ) ; each such choice defines a distinct theory .",
    "some of the freedoms mentioned have been used to make a variant of t@xmath0v@xmath0s ( sanders 2005a , 2005b ; henceforth s05 ) .",
    "t@xmath0v@xmath0s has gr as a limit for @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( b04 ) .",
    "thus if @xmath47 and the size of the system of interest falls well short of @xmath29 , predictions of t@xmath0v@xmath0s and gr should not be that different . to verify that t@xmath0v@xmath0s can also give mond in some other limit",
    "one must make a choice for the function @xmath30 in action ( [ scalar ] ) .",
    "b04 makes the choice which is equivalent to the relation @xmath48 this is to be regarded as defining a toy theory .",
    "a better choice would have the r.h.s .",
    "change sign smoothly through @xmath49 , a transition corresponding to the passage between a quasistatic system such as a cluster of galaxies ( @xmath50 ) and cosmology ( @xmath51 ) ( see b04 ) .",
    "imagine linearizing the einstein - like equations of t@xmath0v@xmath0s about flat spacetime ( @xmath52 ) in a quasistatic situation .",
    "the final result for the physical metric after suitable choice of units is ( b04 ) @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the usual newtonian potential of the baryonic matter and @xmath55 is a constant depending on @xmath23 and on the asymptotic ( cosmological ) value of the scalar field @xmath13 ; @xmath55 is expected to be close to unity . with @xmath11",
    "interpreted as the physical gravitational potential , metric ( [ weakmetric ] ) is precisely that used in gr to discuss both dynamics _ and _ gravitational lensing .",
    "an immediate conclusion is that if gr succeeds in describing both the dynamics of , say , a galaxy , and its lensing properties with a _",
    "single _ assumed dm distribution , and if t@xmath0v@xmath0s succeeds in predicting the dynamics everywhere from the observed baryonic distribution , then t@xmath0v@xmath0s will predict the same lensing pattern as gr .",
    "thus the problem that accosted raqual and variants of it ( sec .",
    "[ relativistic ] ) is solved : lensing can be described using mond ideas .",
    "this much was clear earlier from the non - covariant framework ( sanders 1997 ) .",
    "of course the problem with galaxy cluster dynamics ( sec .  [ intro ] ) still looms .",
    "but it is important to realize that the two mentioned problems are distinct .    obviously , to determine @xmath11 requires one to calculate @xmath13 from the baryonic mass distribution using the t@xmath0v@xmath0s analog of eq .",
    "( [ aqual ] ) . in the linearized framework mentioned and assuming spherical symmetry , one can be immediately integrate the said equation once to get ( we assume @xmath56 as well as @xmath57 ) @xmath58 thus we get the mond equation ( [ mond ] ) , as well as a formula for @xmath5 showing the appropriate asymptotic behavior at small and large @xmath59 , and the value of @xmath9 expressed in terms of the t@xmath0v@xmath0s parameters .",
    "mond is recovered .",
    "famaey and binney ( 2005 ) have noted that the galaxy s rotation curve is not fully consistent with this @xmath5 . apparently a better @xmath30 is needed .",
    "( dashed ) , @xmath60 ( in units of @xmath61 cms@xmath62 ) with @xmath63 ( solid ) or @xmath64 ( dotted ) from t@xmath0v@xmath0s plotted vs the distance from the sun . observed constraints on the non - newtonian part of the acceleration , @xmath60 , are ( left to right ) : from the precession of perihelion of mercury , and of icarus , from variation of kepler s constant between earth and mars , between inner planets and jupiter , uranus or neptune , respectively .",
    "the solid bar is the pioneer anomaly range .",
    ", width=226 ]    the approximation inherent in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) is good for all extragalactic applications , but begins to fail when @xmath65 . in such situations ,",
    "e.g. the solar system , it is best to start from the first term of the laurent expansion of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) about @xmath49 .",
    "one then obtains @xmath66 the fact that @xmath5 asymptotes to @xmath67 as @xmath68 means that for arbitrarily strong fields gravity is newtonian , except that the effective gravitational constant is @xmath69 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the salient post - newtonian parameters ( will 1993 ) , important for inner solar system celestial dynamics , agree with those of gr ; in particular @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( giannios 2004 , b04 ) .    notice the slow approach of @xmath5 to its asymptotic value as @xmath72 strengthens .",
    "one consequence is a slow increase of the kepler constant @xmath73 with distance from the sun .",
    "1 illustrates this effect and compares it with the constraints set by measurements of the orbits of diverse planets .",
    "although a better form of @xmath30 is clearly required , the significant point is that , in such theories , the total force in the outer solar system will inevitably deviate from inverse square .",
    "this is of considerable interest in view of the pioneer anomaly ( anderson et al .",
    "1998 , turyshev 2005 ) ."
