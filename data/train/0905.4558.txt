    "it is now widely recognised that strong radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) must be powered by collimated relativistic energy flows ( rees 1966 ) .",
    "the bulk lorentz factors ( @xmath6 ) of these flows may be different in different systems and at different distances from the active nucleus .",
    "if a blob of plasma moving at relativistic speed is observed at small angles to the jet axis ( @xmath7 ) the observed radiation is amplified and the timescales shortened due to relativistic effects .",
    "such systems are generically called blazars ( blandford & rees 1978 ) .",
    "blazars have been often classified in subcategories : flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , characterized by strong and broad optical emission lines , and bl lac objects , when no emission lines are apparent above the optical / uv continuum ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "remarkably , the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( cgro ) together with the first generation of cherenkov telescopes discovered that the sed of a number of the brightest blazars extend to the @xmath5-ray range , showing two broad components : the first one , covering radio to soft x - rays , is thought to be due to the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons , while the second one , covering the hard x-/@xmath0ray band , is generally attributed to inverse - compton ( ic ) emission .",
    "the seed photons for the ic process can originate from the synchrotron radiation itself ( synchrotron self - compton , ssc ; e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "1985 ) or from an external source , like the accretion disk , the broad - line region or a dusty torus ( external compton , ec ; e.g. dermer et al .",

    "( 1998 ) found an interesting trend  the blazar sequence ",
    "whereby for sources with low bolometric luminosity both components peak at high frequencies ( uv / soft x - rays for synchrotron and tev for ic  high - frequency peaked bl lacs , hbl ) , while , for increasing luminosities , both peaks shift to lower frequencies ( low - frequency peaked bl lacs , lbl and fsrq ) .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed to explain the sequence in terms of correlation between the random lorentz factor of electrons emitting at the peaks of the sed ( @xmath8 ) and the global energy density ( @xmath9 ) in the comoving frame .",
    "hbl have low @xmath9 and high @xmath8 , while fsrq have high @xmath9 and low @xmath8 .",
    "the sequence can also be interpreted in an evolutionary frame ( bttcher & dermer 2002 , cavaliere & delia 2002 ) .",
    "it is important to stress that the selection of objects with which the sequence was constructed was admittedly biased by the available samples , within which only a limited number of objects had @xmath5-ray data ( maraschi & tavecchio 2001 ) .",
    "in fact challenges have been raised to the validity of the sequence ( for a review , see padovani 2007 and references therein ) , which however could be overcome ( maraschi et al .",
    "2008 , ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 ) .",
    "today , the ongoing _ fermi _ mission is expected to provide a deeper and unbiased survey of the whole @xmath0ray sky , compared to that available during the _ cgro_/egret era , yielding possible surprises , as we will show in the present work .",
    "although the origin of relativistic jets is presently still not understood , there is increasing evidence that the properties of jets are related to the properties of the accretion flow which feeds the central black hole . in the case of stellar mass black holes the observed phenomenology points to an association of jet launching with accretion `` modes '' characterized by different spectral and timing properties ( fender & belloni 2004 ) . in the extragalactic domain",
    "the separation of radio sources into two broad classes ( fri and frii ) , as well as the properties of their respective `` beamed '' representatives , bl lacs and fsrq , can be basically understood within a scenario based on the accretion mode : in the first class accretion onto the central black hole is sub - critical ( in eddington units ) leading to radiatively inefficient accretion flows and relatively weak jets , while in the second one the accretion rate is near critical , giving rise to bright disks and powerful jets ( ghisellini & celotti 2001 , maraschi 2001 , maraschi & tavecchio 2003 ; see , however , also blandford & levinson 1995 ) .    in this respect ,",
    "the case of radio - loud narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) active nuclei has received increasing attention .",
    "nls1 are characterized by an optical spectrum with narrow permitted lines fwhm(h@xmath2 )  @xmath10  km / s , the ratio between [ oiii]@xmath11 and h@xmath2 smaller than 3 and a bump due to feii ( see , e.g. , pogge 2000 for a review ) .",
    "they exhibit also prominent soft x - ray excesses .",
    "these properties point to very high ( near eddington ) accretion rates and relatively low masses ( @xmath12 ) ( boroson 2002 ; see , however , decarli et al .",
    "2008 , marconi et al .",
    "only a small percentage of nls1 are radio - loud ( @xmath13 ) or very radio - loud ( @xmath14 ) ( 7% and 2.5 % respectively ) .",
    "their flat radio spectra suggest that several of them could host relativistic jets : in fact vlbi variability indicates extremly high brightness temperatures and in some cases superluminal expansion has been observed ( komossa et al .",
    "2006 , doi et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "recently , yuan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) studied a complete sample of radio - loud nls1 selected from the _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) sample .",
    "they find that a large fraction of those for which x - ray data exist show broad band spectra similar to those of hbl , with peaks close to the uv band .",
    "the study of simultaneous optical / uv / x - ray data of a sample of radio - loud nls1 revealed that these sources often display a hard x - ray component , especially in bright optical and ultraviolet states , thus supporting the possible contribution of a relativistic jet , in some cases similar to fsrq ( foschini et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "this class of sources thus is of extreme interest for extending the studies of the properties of relativistic jets to different mass and power scales . while it is clear that the most radio - loud nls1 should host relativistic jets , the properties of such jets at high energy are essentially unknown . observations of a few selected sources in the tev energy range with the _",

    "2007 ) , where is the maximum of efficiency in reprocessing the impinging photons into ir radiation .    for the above choice of parameters ,",
    "the blr is the main producer of the seed photons for the inverse compton scattering in the emitting region . in fig .",
    "[ sed ] , this component is labeled ec .",
    "on the other hand , the synchrotron self ",
    "compton ( ssc ) radiation is important in the x  ray band , where it dominates the radiative output ( the two  peak shape of the ssc curve correspond to the first and second order scattering ) . in this scenario ,",
    "i.e. with the x - ray data due to the ssc emission , the magnetic field @xmath130 is strongly constrained , since it controls the value of the ssc emission . in our case @xmath153 g.    the particle energy distribution of the emitting electrons",
    "is calculated by the continuity equation , assuming the injected electrons are distributed in energy according to a smoothly joining broken power law of slopes @xmath154 and @xmath155 below and above @xmath156 , respectively .",
    "the maximum electron energy corresponds to a random lorentz factor of @xmath157 and the inverse - compton peak corresponds to @xmath158 .",
    "the total power injected in the form of relativistic electrons is @xmath159  erg  s@xmath4 , as calculated in the comoving frame .",
    "once accelerated , the bulk kinetic power carried by the electrons in the jet is @xmath160  erg  s@xmath4 , to be compared with the poynting flux @xmath161  erg  s@xmath4 and the power in radiation , @xmath162  erg  s@xmath4 . as occurs in typical powerful blazars ( see e.g. celotti & ghisellini 2008 ,",
    "also for the exact definitions of these powers ) , the radiation observed carries more power than what is available in magnetic field and electron energy .",
    "thus we require that the jet also carries protons : if we assume one proton per electron , we obtain @xmath163  erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "this value can be reduced , by assuming the presence of pairs .",
    "the impact of the presence of narrow permitted lines in the blr can be evaluated in two ways .",
    "first , there can be a geometrical explanation : if the blr is torus  like and we are observing it face  on , then the doppler broadening is reduced and the line width is smaller than usual .",
    "a similar geometry has been invoked by decarli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to explain why nls1 have not small masses .    this blr geometry ,",
    "although different from what used in the adopted model , does not affect any of the model results , since the important parameter is the angle at which the jet sees the blr .",
    "second , it is still possible to consider a isotropic geometry of the blr and take into account the effect of the radiation pressure , as proposed by marconi et al .",
    "the blr is then moved farther off the central singularity ( @xmath164  cm ) , but the impact in the model parameters mainly results in an increase of @xmath6 from 10 to 13 .",
    "other new values of parameters are : @xmath165 , @xmath166 @xmath167  erg  s@xmath4 , @xmath168  gauss .",
    "the power output of the jet is : @xmath169  erg  s@xmath4 , @xmath170  erg  s@xmath4 , @xmath171  erg  s@xmath4 , @xmath172  erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "it is worth noting that the systematics in the lat data do not affect significantly the results of the modeling .",
    "indeed , in the case of a lat flux equal to the 130% of the observed value ( the worst case ) , it is sufficient to increase a little the injected power @xmath173 ( from @xmath174 to @xmath175  erg  s@xmath4 ) and to decrease a little the magnetic field @xmath130 ( from @xmath176 to @xmath177  gauss ) .",
    "the derived quantities become @xmath178  erg  s@xmath4 , @xmath179  erg  s@xmath4 , @xmath180  erg  s@xmath4 , @xmath181  erg  s@xmath4 . a change in the @xmath5-ray photon index equal to @xmath182 results in very negligible changes in the sed .",
    "the model parameters used to explain the sed of pmn  j0948 + 0022 are rather well constrained , given the basic assumptions of the model .",
    "however , they may not be unique",
    ". another solution might be possible if we assume that the dusty torus contributing to the ir seed photons is hotter and more compact than assumed here .",
    "it must be hotter because otherwise we need too energetic electrons to fit the hard x  ray emission ( by ec ) , and these very same electrons would overproduce ( by synchrotron ) the observed emission in the optical .",
    "a stratified and clumpy torus ( e.g. nenkova et al . 2008 ) could work .",
    "also in this `` hot and clumpy torus '' case we can obtain a reasonable representation of the data ( i.e. the same ratios between the radiation energy densities  both by synchrotron and external photons  and the magnetic energy density ) , at distances one order of magnitude larger than assumed here . as a consequence , the emitting region should be one order of magnitude larger , and thus should vary on longer timescales .",
    "the detection of a typical variability timescale can therefore discriminate between the two possible solutions .",
    "our findings show clearly that pmn  j0948 + 0022 , the first narrow - line quasar detected in @xmath5rays , hosts a relativistic jet with sed very similar to those of `` classical '' fsrq .",
    "the parameters relevant for the spectral shape of the sed derived from the modelling , using the approach by ghisellini and tavecchio ( 2009 ) , are consistent with those of high  power blazars , though at the lower limit in power of the fsrq region as derived , for example , in celotti & ghisellini ( 2008 ) for a large sample of blazars ( cf . their fig .  2 and fig .  6 ) .",
    "the comparison of radio vs @xmath5ray properties shows that in both bands pmn  j0948 + 0022 has a relatively low power with respect to the other fsrq detected by lat to date , although no striking differences appear ( fig .",
    "[ radiogamma ] ) .",
    "effelsberg and ovro radio observations also show characteristics similar to those of fsrq .",
    "we believe that pmn  j0948 + 0022 could be one of the first examples of a fsrq with relatively small mass but high accretion rate in terms of eddington ratio .",
    "this would fit well with the scenario in which the transition between high peaked and low peaked blazars is not related to absolute power but to the eddington ratio as indicated by the fri - frii separation which depends on mass .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the jets in other radio - loud nls1 conform to this scenario .",
    "_ fermi _ is expected to answer this question by measuring the @xmath5-ray luminosity and spectra of the most radio - loud ones .",
    "the _ fermi_/lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france ,",
    "the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden .    additional support for science analysis during the operations phase from the following agencies is also gratefully acknowledged : the istituto nazionale di astrofisica in italy and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation in sweden for providing a grant in support of a royal swedish academy of sciences research fellowship for jc .",
    "this research is partly based on observations with the 100-m telescope of the mpifr ( max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie ) at effelsberg .",
