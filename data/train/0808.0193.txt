    "it is common use to summarize with the term `` star formation '' how stars form from the neutral gas reservoir of a galaxy , and how they evolve and affect the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) . through their winds and supernova explosions ,",
    "stars release kinetic energy and freshly synthesized metals to the ism , with the possible effect of locally suppressing the formation of new stars and triggering it on somewhat larger scales across their host galaxy ( i.e. stellar feedback ) .",
    "the global properties of disk galaxies have been extensively studied by now , to find that the average star formation rate ( sfr ) of a galaxy tightly correlates with its gas surface density ( schmidt 1959 , 1963 , kennicutt 1998a , b ) .",
    "this important result alone , however , does not put strong constraints on the physics of star formation itself ; it has been indeed shown that different mechanisms can produce this observed correlation ( e.g. silk 1997 , kennicutt 1998b , elmegreen 2002 ) . moreover",
    ", our knowledge of star formation is mainly based on local disk galaxies , chemically and dynamically different from local , dwarf irregulars which sometimes undergo intense starbursts ( heckman 1998 ) .",
    "because of their size and low metallicity , dwarf galaxies are considered to be the local analogs to the galaxy population at high redshift , where starbursts are observed to be a rather recurrent phenomenon ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 , pettini et al .",
    "2001 , blain et al .",
    "2002 , scott et al .",
    "therefore , understanding the details of star formation in nearby galaxies of different hubble types is crucial for boot - strapping theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this is now made possible by a new generation of instruments which provide high angular resolution throughout the whole spectral range , and especially for the observations of atomic h gas at 21 cm ( hi ) .",
    "these new data allow us to spatially resolve the star - formation activity and the gas distribution within a galaxy , and to analyze their correlation on small scales and across a wide range of local , physical conditions .",
    "this approach has been recently applied by kennicutt et al .",

    ", we apply a similar method to the dwarf galaxy ic  2574 with the aim of describing its star - formation activity ( i.e. age and mass surface density of its stellar populations ) and comparing those properties with the interstellar medium ( i.e. hi ) on a @xmath1 100 parsec scale .    ic  2574 ( aka ugc  5666 , ddo  81 )",
    "is a gas - rich dwarf , actively forming stars in the m81 group .",
    "miller & hodge ( 1994 ) observed it in the h@xmath2 emission and identified 289 hii regions , each about 50 pc in diameter .",
    "the largest complex of star - forming regions is located in the north - east of the galaxy ( also known as a hi supergiant shell , walter et al .",
    "1998 , walter & brinks 1999 ) .",
    "the authors estimated a global star - formation rate sfr @xmath1 0.08 m@xmath3yr@xmath4 and concluded that ic  2574 is forming stars at roughly its average rate .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy on some hii regions in the ne complex by tomita et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that the h@xmath2 velocity field is chaotic in all regions except two ( ic2574-i and ic2574-iv ) , which are characterized by a v - shaped velocity distribution .",
    "this v - shaped feature is usually representitative of stellar winds blowing out the interstellar medium .",
    "interestingly enough , drissen et al . ( 1993 ) found three candidate wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars in ic2574-i .",
    "wrs are evolved massive stars known to develop stellar winds stronger than o stars of the same luminosity and to make up as much as 50@xmath0 of the total mass and kinetic energy released by all massive stars into the interstellar medium ( cf .",
    "leitherer , robert & drissen 1992 ) .",
    "therefore , their presence in ic2574-i can well explain the bulk motion observed in this hii region , and also date the region to be a few myrs old , given that the wr phase is as short as 2 - 5 myr ( robert et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the most intriguing property of ic2574 is , however , the spatial distribution of its neutral interstellar medium .",
    "the high - resolution vla observations of ic  2574 have resulted in a very structured hi map , with 48 holes ranging in size from @xmath5 100 pc to @xmath5 1000 pc .",
    "these features appear to be expanding with a radial velocity of about 10 km  s@xmath4 , which , in turn , defines dynamical ages and kinetic energies consistent with being driven by stellar winds and supernova explosions ( walter & brinks 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , the comparison of the hi map with ultraviolet ( uit ) and optical images has revealed that the hii regions located in the ne complex are distributed along the rim of the hi supergiant shell , and the shell itself is devoided of neutral and ionized gas , possibly filled with hot x - ray gas ( walter et al .",
    "stewart & walter ( 2000 ) identified a star cluster within the supergiant shell with no associated h@xmath2 emission and with an age ( 11 myr ) comparable to the shell dynamical age of 14 myr .",
    "they dated the h@xmath2-emitting rim of the shell to be about 3 myr old .",
    "the authors thus concluded that the hi supergiant shell was created by this star cluster and the shell expansion triggered the star formation activity along its rim .",
    "as pointed out by walter & brinks ( 1999 ) , the occurrence of h@xmath2 emission along the rim of a hi feature is common to all the hi holes found in ic  2574 , even if no remnant central star cluster has been identified so far .",
    "the question is then whether these holes are the result of stellar feedback as in the case of the supergiant shell or are produced by different mechanisms .",
    "the data collected so far for the magellanic clouds ( kim et al . 1999 ,",
    "hatzidimitriou et al . 2005 ) , m31 and m33 ( cf .",
    "van der hulst 1996 ) and holmberg ii ( rhode et al . 1999 ) offer very little support for a one - to - one correlation between hi holes and ob associations , although the kinetic energy of the hole expansion is consistent with the expansion being triggered by the total energy released by a single stellar population .",
    "one possible explanation that has been put forward is that at least some hi holes ( especially those with no indication of recent star formation ) may have been produced by mechanisms unrelated to young stars .",
    "for example , loeb & perna ( 1998 ) and efremov , elmegreen & hodge ( 1998 ) suggest they arise from gamma - ray bursts .",
    "hi holes may also be produced by the collision of high - velocity clouds of neutral gas with the galactic disk ( cf .",
    "tenorio - tagle 1980 , 1981 ) , or , more simply , by the intrinsic turbulence of the interstellar medium ( elmegreen & efremov 1999 , dib , bell & burkert 2006 ) .",
    "rhode et al . ( 1999 ) proposed the intergalactic uv radiation field as an additional mechanism to create holes in the hi gas by keeping it ionized ( at least in the outskirts of the galactic disk where the hi volume density is lower ) , while bureau & carignan ( 2002 ) suggested that the hi holes detected in holmberg ii may have formed by ram pressure from the intragroup medium .",
    "one could also imagine that the lack of a one - to - one correlation between hi holes and ob associations may be due to the limited photometric depth of the data .",
    "for example , rhode et al . ( 1999 ) reached a limiting magnitude @xmath6 23 mag in holmberg ii and may have failed to detect fainter young stars ( i.e. late b spectral types ) .",
    "we have taken advantage of the high sensitivity and wide field of view of the lbc blue camera mounted on the large binocular telescope to perform deep optical imaging , to study in detail the stellar populations in ic  2574 and to investigate the possible _ stellar origin _ of the hi holes in this galaxy .",
    "our aim is to identify low - luminosity star clusters within these features , to establish how their stellar content may be different from any other position across the galaxy , and whether the energy budget of the young stars in the hi holes can account for the kinetic energy of these structures .",
    "this study allows us also to derive the star - formation history of ic  2574 locally , at different galactocentric radii and in correspondence with different hi column densities .",

    "there is a final aspect to consider in our analysis of the hi holes formation , i.e. the ionization of the hi gas due to stellar radiation .",

    "we estimate the number of ionizing photons , @xmath83 , in each hole and control aperture from the value tabulated by starburst99 at the age of the young component in the hole / aperture scaled by its total mass .",

    "we assume @xmath87 = 4.54@xmath910@xmath88 for a gas temperature of 5000 k. we derive the hi volume density @xmath86 from the relation : @xmath65 = @xmath89 where @xmath90 , the scale height of the hi disk , is 440 pc as obtained by walter & brinks ( 1999 ) for a distance of 4.02 mpc .",
    "if all the stellar photons produced within the control apertures ionized the surrounding hi gas , the radius of the strmgren sphere of the control apertures with @xmath73 70@xmath0 would be on average 4 times bigger than the aperture radius , and the apertures would lie in holes that are well observable .",
    "given that the control apertures are not associated with hi holes by definition , only a much lower fraction of @xmath83 can ionize the hi gas .",
    "this limits the number of ionizing photons to less than 20@xmath0 of @xmath83 ; under this assumption , the ratio of @xmath84 to the aperture radius decreases to an average value of 2 , consistent with an uncertainty on @xmath83 of a factor of 3 which is due to the errors on the stellar ages and masses .",
    "this constraint would make any hi hole formed via ionization less likely detectable .",
    "for the hi holes with @xmath73 70@xmath0 , the uv radiation from the young stellar populations would produce a stromgren sphere 4 times larger than the hole radius if 100@xmath0 of the ionizing photons are available . making the observed hole consistent with the stromgren radius",

    "therefore , such a limit on @xmath83 may be sufficient to explain both the existence of those hi holes whose stellar populations are predominatly young ( @xmath58 16 myr ) , and the lack of observable hi holes around the control apertures .",
    "deep , lbt imaging in the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands has allowed us to spatially map the star formation history of ic  2574 over the last @xmath510@xmath38 yrs .",

    ". however , these values are luminosity - weighted and therefore biased .",
    "given that the @xmath10-band flux emitted by a single stellar population decreases for increasing age and the flux itself is proportional to the stars total mass , the detection of stars above a fixed threshold in the @xmath10-band ( used in this study as a prior ) requires stellar populations progressively more massive as they grow older .",
    "quantitatively speaking , a limiting surface brightness of 26 mag  arcsec@xmath18 allows us to detect stellar populations older than 10@xmath38 yrs with a mass surface density larger than 0.1 m@xmath3pc@xmath18 , while those populations few myr young are detected down to a mass surface density of 0.003 m@xmath3pc@xmath18 ( a factor of @xmath5 30 lower than at 100 myr ) . the fact that we do not detect young stellar populations as massive as 1 m@xmath3pc@xmath18 is not a selection effect of the data ; it possibly hints at a constant star formation rate , at least over the last @xmath510@xmath38 yrs , so that the younger burst has not had time yet to produce the same amount of stellar mass as was assembled during the older burst .",
    "we compare both the stellar ages and the mass surface densities of the recently formed populations with the hi column density all across ic  2574 and do not find any significant correlation between the star formation activity and the hi reservoir in this galaxy .",

    "the lack of correlation between the star formation activity and the hi density in ic  2574 is rather puzzling with respect to the distinct hi holes , as one would expect to systematically detect a central cluster of young stars driving the hole expansion through their stellar winds and supernova explosions . with the possible exception of the supergiant shell ( cf . stewart & walter 2000 )",
    ", we do not observe any concentration of young stellar populations at the center of the hi holes , but rather a mixture of populations formed during the younger and older bursts , with the younger population often in clumps located at the periphery of the hi hole .",
    "we determine the fraction of pixels with a stellar age younger than 16 myr ( @xmath63 ) for 15 of the 48 holes identified by walter & brinks ( 1999 ) ( i.e. those that overlap with the area of the galaxy obtained after the removal of its smooth disk component , see sect .",
    ", the age of 16 myr is assumed to separate the younger from the older star formation episode identified by us .",
    "we also compute the mean age ( @xmath58age@xmath96 ) and the total energy ( e@xmath97 , due to stellar winds and supernova explosions ) of the stars formed during the younger burst in each hole and compare them with the dynamical age and kinetic energy of the hole ( based on its expansion velocity ) .",
    "the relevant results of such a comparison are that :      _ ii ) _ the dynamical ages of the holes are generally higher than the younger burst by a factor of 5 .",
    "the holes dynamical age is though an upper limit as it was computed by walter & brinks assuming a constant expansion rate . in reality",
    ", the holes expansion is expected to have been faster during its earlier phases .",
    "_ iii ) _ the kinetic energy of the holes is on average 10@xmath0 of the total energy released by the younger burst .",
    "this energy ratio ( i.e. the efficiency of stellar feedback ) is in agreement with the value ( 10@xmath0 - 20@xmath0 ) obtained by cole et al .",
    "( 1994 ) from fitting the galaxy luminosity functions and colors , while bradamante et al .",
    "( 1998 ) determined a value of 3@xmath0 for supernovae ii and 100@xmath0 for supernovae ia from the modeling of the chemical evolution of blue compact galaxies .",
    "even at the remarkable photometric depth of the lbt data , we do not find a clear one - to - one association between the observed hi holes and the most recent bursts of star formation .",
    "however , the stars formed during the younger burst do in principle release enough energy to power the expansion of the hi holes . in order to investigate better this apparent discrepancy",
    ", we map ic  2574 in optical and in hi with a set of control apertures equivalent in size to the beam of the radio observations ( 136 pc ) .",
    "no observed hi hole is included among the control apertures . for those apertures with @xmath73 70@xmath0 ( just to focus on the interplay between the younger stellar component and the hi gas )",
    ", we measure their average hi velocity dispersion @xmath71 ( from the second - moment map of walter & brinks ) , their average hi column density @xmath65 , the total stellar energy of their stellar populations younger than 16 myr , @xmath64 , and the hi kinetic energy @xmath67 , defined as @xmath67 = 1.5@xmath98 ( where @xmath69 is the area of the apetures ) . for two thirds of the control apertures the ratio @xmath70 is lower than 100@xmath0 and has an average value of 35@xmath0 ; all the remaining apertures have @xmath99 100@xmath0 and are systematically associated with @xmath74 8 @xmath9 10@xmath35 cm@xmath18 . once again , the stellar populations formed during the younger burst could balance the kinetic energy stored in the hi gas , transform it into an expansion motion and thus produce a detectable hi hole for most of the control apertures . yet , these regions failed to develop a hi hole .",
    "these same stellar populations could also sustain the hi non - circular motions , since their average ratio @xmath80 is 21@xmath0 .",
    "holes in the hi distribution may also be formed by ionization due to the uv emission of the young stars . in the case of those control apertures with @xmath73 70@xmath0 ,",
    "the strmgren sphere produced by their stellar populations younger than 16 myr is 4 times bigger in radius than the apertures and , therefore , would produce a detectable hi hole .",
    "since this is not observed , the fraction of ionizing photons that effectively ionize the hi gas has to be rather small ; a fraction @xmath100 20@xmath0 of the total number of ionizing photons emitted by the young stellar populations reduces the radius of the strmgren sphere to @xmath100 2 times the aperture radius , making any hi hole formed via ionization less likely detectable .",
    "this result is in agreement with the lack of correlation between star formation activity and hi density seen in sect .",
    "4.3 , indicating that star formation does not appear to significantly affect the properties of the hi gas in ic  2574 . from the analysis of the stellar content of the hi holes and the control",
    "apertures it is hard to establish whether stellar / supernova feedback is at work in ic  2574 on local scales of few 100 pc ; this same result has been found for other dwarf galaxies ( lmc and smc , kim et al .",
    "1999 , hatzidimitriou et al . 2005",
    "; m33 , van der hulst 1996 ; holmberg ii , rhode et al .",
    "the ultimate explanation of these findings remains elusive ; it may rest either in an overestimate of the stellar mass loss and stellar winds especially at low metallicity , or in our understanding of how stellar energy interacts with the interstellar medium .",
    "another explanation may be found in a stochastic sampling of the imf in low - mass stellar systems .",
    "stellar - populations synthesis codes usually assume that the imf is a densely sampled probabilistic distribution function , while the imf is in reality poorly and discretely sampled in low - mass stellar systems .",
    "this assumption produces fluctuactions in the predicted properties of these systems which may mislead comparisons with the observations ( cervio & valls - gabaud 2003 ) , by overestimating , for example , the stellar energy realesed to the ism and thus underestimating the efficiency of stellar feedback .",
    "as shown by cervio & molla ( 2002 ) , cervio & luridiana ( 2006 ) and carigi & hernandez ( 2008 ) , stochastic effects on the imf sampling become significant in low metallicity systems such as dwarf galaxies .",

    "oh for making available the map of the kinetic energy associated with non - circular motions in ic  2574 , and p. smith for assisting with the observations . based on data acquired using the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) .",
