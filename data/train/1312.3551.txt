    "further changes in the magnetic field allow navigation through the rich spectrum of near - threshold bound states ( see the lower panel of fig.[fig : sboundspectrum](b ) for example ) , traversing the avoided crossings between molecular states either diabatically or adiabatically depending on the rate of change of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the molecules may be separated from the atomic cloud by exploiting the difference in the magnetic moments of the molecules and the atoms ; time of flight expansion in the presence of an applied magnetic field gradient leads to a stern - gerlach separation of the atoms and molecules @xcite . in bosonic gases ,",

    "the creation and separation of molecules is complicated by the presence of the @xmath49 bound state , which runs parallel to the atomic threshold at a binding energy of 110(2)khz@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this state leads to strong avoided crossings just below threshold as the more deeply bound molecular states responsible for the feshbach resonances approach threshold . as a consequence sweeping across a feshbach resonance from high to low field creates molecules in the near - threshold @xmath49 state with a magnetic moment of @xmath50 .",
    "crucially , the ratio of magnetic moment to mass for molecules in this state is almost identical to that for @xmath0rb in the ( 1,+1 ) state _ and _ @xmath1cs in the ( 3,+3 ) state .",
    "consequently , in order for the stern - gerlach separation to work , the molecules must be transferred into a different state with a substantially different magnetic moment .",
    "we therefore associate the molecules on the feshbach resonance arising from the @xmath37 state at 197.10(3)g and then sweep the magnetic field to 181 g , adiabatically following the avoided crossing below the feshbach resonance at 181.55(5)g and transferring the molecules via the weak - field - seeking @xmath36 state into the high - field - seeking @xmath51 state with a magnetic moment of @xmath52 .",

    "an ultracold atomic mixture is produced by evaporation in the dipole trap at a bias field of 22 g .",
    "the magnetic field is then quickly increased to 212 g to avoid three - body losses induced by crossing several interspecies and intraspecies feshbach resonances ( see fig.[fig : sboundspectrum ] ) . from here the field is decreased to 197.5 g , very close to the upper end of the resonance loss feature ( see fig.[fig : boundstate](b ) ) . after a hold time of 3.5ms to allow the magnetic field to settle , the field is further decreased by @xmath53 g in 2ms . during this ramp ,",
    "molecules in the least - bound state @xmath49 are produced . in the current setup",

    "<S> we report the production of @xmath0rbcs feshbach molecules in a crossed - beam dipole trap . </S>",
    "<S> a mixture of @xmath0rb and @xmath1cs is cooled close to quantum degeneracy before an interspecies feshbach resonance at 197  g is used to associate up to @xmath2 molecules with a temperature of @xmath3nk . </S>",
    "<S> the molecules are confined in the dipole trap with a lifetime of 0.21(1)s , long enough for future experiments exploring optical transfer to the absolute ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecules in a magnetic bias field range between 181 and 185 g to demonstrate the ability to control the character of the molecular state . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we have performed feshbach spectroscopy in a field range from 0 to 1200 g and located three previously unobserved resonances at high magnetic fields . </S>"
