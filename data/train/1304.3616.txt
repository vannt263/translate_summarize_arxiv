    "the recent discovery of a new boson with a mass of 125 gev at the cern lhc @xcite matches many of the properties of the higgs boson from the higgs mechanism within the standard model ( sm ) . with more data analyzed",
    ", the lhc is expected to be able to probe the detailed properties of this new scalar particle , and verify its nature .",
    "a first determination of the couplings , spin and parity properties can be performed with the current results .",
    "the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations have presented that the observed state resembles very closely to the higgs boson .",
    "searching for the properties of this new boson can extend our knowledge of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) sector .",
    "this search has also very important consequences on theories beyond the sm .    from the theoretical side , there could be different ewsb scenarios in which the higgs boson can be elementary and weakly interacting @xcite or composite and related to a new strongly interacting sector @xcite . under the assumption",
    "there is new physics associated with the ewsb sector , its effects on the phenomenology of the higgs boson can be parametrized in terms of an effective lagrangian at the electroweak scale . in this framework",
    ", the corrections from higher dimensional operators to the higgs boson @xmath10 ) couplings to the gauge bosons ( @xmath11 ) can be expressed through an effective lagrangian .",
    "the efffective operators give rise to anomalous @xmath12 couplings , and these operators can modify both the higgs boson production and its decay rates @xcite .",
    "extensive studies about the anomalous @xmath0 couplings described by a model independent effective lagrangian approach have been performed in the literature at hadron colliders @xcite and lepton colliders @xcite .",
    "the predictions on the measurement of ratios of the higgs couplings with an accuracy at the level of a few percent have been given in @xcite for the lhc at @xmath13 tev with a high luminosity of 300 fb@xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the precision measurement of the self - couplings of this new boson is very important for the future experiments since it could well point the new physics beyond the sm .    the lhec could probe the @xmath0 couplings without any assumption on the @xmath15 couplings .",
    "it has the uniqe oppurtunity to probe @xmath0 couplings in higgs production via weak vector boson fusion , in contrast to the production at the lhc where the contributions come from the @xmath15 and @xmath0 couplings .",
    "therefore , it is a particular interest since these couplings could receive sizeable anomalous contributions from physics beyond the sm",
