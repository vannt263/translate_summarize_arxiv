    "financial markets have been receiving increasing attention from physicists [ 1 - 10 ] .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that recent empirical studies on financial time series have found power laws , which emerge from complex systems , for many of these series [ 1 - 4 ] . in the present study , we focus attention on inflationary bubbles which ended in crashes in financial markets . in the last two decades ,",
    "the financial markets have been distinguished by increasingly frequent financial crashes .",
    "unfortunately , although it is extremely important to elucidate the mechanisms of financial crashes , little is yet known [ 10 ] .",
    "we here present the results of an empirical analysis performed by taking a new approach to bubbles and their collapses .",
    "we conducted a quantitative investigation on the statistical properties of price fluctuations in the nikkei 225 index , which is the arithmetic average of the stock prices of 225 large companies listed in the tokyo stock exchange .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the daily series of the nikkei 225 index during the period from january of 1975 to december of 2002 .",
    "the nikkei 225 index reached a high of almost 40,000 yen on the last trading day of the decade of the 1980s , but then declined approximately 14,309 during the period from the first trading day of 1990 to mid - august of 1992 , a drop of about 63 percent .",
    "thus , we divide the time series of the nikkei 225 index into two parts : the period of inflation ( bubbles ) , from january of 1975 to december of 1989 , and the period of deflation ( anti - bubbles ) , form january of 1990 to december of 2002 .",
    "we show that the price fluctuations in the inflationary period can be approximated by asymptotic",
    "_ power laws _ provided by non - extensive statistical mechanics , while the price fluctuations in the deflationary period obey _ exponential laws _ provided by boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics .",
    "we first investigated the basic statistics of the price fluctuations . we define price fluctuations @xmath3 as the _ log return _ , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the nikkei 225 index on the date @xmath6 .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows the daily returns of the nikkei 225 index in the period from january 4 , 1975 to december 30 , 2002 .",
    "table 1 shows differences in the statistical properties between the inflationary period ( january 4 , 1975 to december 29 , 1989 ) and the deflationary period ( january 4 , 1990 to december 30 , 2002 ) .",
    "the mean of the returns @xmath7 is positive in the inflationary period and negative in the deflationary period .",
    "the standard deviation of the returns @xmath8 in the deflationary period is about two times as high as that in the inflationary period .",
    "note that we omit the data of november 20 , 1987 , when the nikkei 225 index had the greatest negative return , as an extreme value because extreme values would strongly affect the estimation of skewness @xmath9 and kurtosis @xmath10 . the return distribution is negatively skewed during the inflationary period , and positively skewed in the deflationary period . finally , the kurtosis of the return distribution in the inflationary period is higher than that in the deflationary period , indicating that the return distribution has a _ fat tail _ in the inflationary period , compared to that in the deflationary period .",
    "that is , there is a higher probability for extreme values in the return distribution in the inflationary period than in the deflationary period .",
    ".*statistics of the return * [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for the purposes of the present study , we define volatility as the absolute value of the log return @xmath11 .",
    "figure 1(c ) shows the absolute log - return @xmath12 for the nikkei 225 index for the 28-year study period .",
    "figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) show the semi - log plots of the complementary cumulative probability distributions of the absolute log - returns for the nikkei 225 index for both the inflationary and deflationary periods .",
    "it follows from figure 2(a ) that the complementary cumulative probability distribution of the absolute log - returns for the period of deflation is accurately described by an exponential distribution , @xmath13 in the whole range of the absolute log - returns @xmath12 .",
    "we estimate the parameter @xmath14 using the least square method , which gives @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "it also follows from figure 2(b ) that the complementary cumulative probability distribution of the absolute log - returns for the period of inflation deviates from the exponential distribution as the absolute log - returns becomes greater .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the log - log plot of the distribution of the absolute log - returns in the inflationary period .",
    "this plot shows an asymptotic power law where the value of the absolute log - return is large , but deviates from the power law where the value of the absolute log - return is small .",
    "one approach to incorporating this deviation from the power law is to consider the @xmath0-exponential function [ 11 ] .",
    "we find that the complementary cumulative probability distribution of the absolute log - returns of the inflationary period is well approximated by the following @xmath0-exponential distribution :    @xmath17^{1/(1-q)}.   % ( 2)\\ ] ]    we estimate the parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath18 using the nonlinear least square method , which gives @xmath19 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that for @xmath20 the @xmath0-exponential distribution has a power - law tail , i.e. , @xmath21 [ 4 ] , and for @xmath2 it becomes an exponential function since @xmath22 .",
    "here , we introduce another possible way of analyzing data by using a generalized mono - log plot based on the inverse function of the @xmath0-exponential function , which is the @xmath0-logarithmic function given by @xmath23 \\equiv ( x^{1-q } - 1)/(1 - q ) $ ] .",
    "this generalized function arises naturally in the framework of tsallis statistics [ 11,12 ] .",
    "it is easy to verify that the plot of @xmath24 $ ] versus @xmath25 leads to a straight line if the data are well described by the @xmath0-exponential distribution ( figure 3(b ) ) .",
    "our results indicate that the absolute log - return is approximated by the @xmath0-exponential distribution where @xmath1 in the inflationary period , while during the deflationary period , the distribution of the absolute log - returns is accurately described by an _",
    "exponential _ distribution , that is , the @xmath0-exponential distribution where @xmath26 .",
    "as has been demonstrated by c. tsallis [ 11 ] , boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics typically provides _ exponential laws _ for describing stationary states , while non - extensive statistical mechanics typically provides asymptotic _",
    "power laws_. the empirical findings presented here indicate that the price fluctuations in the inflationary ( bubble ) period can be described by a power law based on non - extensive statistical mechanics , while the price fluctuations in the deflationary ( anti - bubble ) period can be described by an exponential law based on boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics .",
    "the present study raises the interesting question , left for future research , of whether the empirical facts found here hold true in other stock markets such as the new york stock exchange .",
    "this study will be left for future work .",
    "our empirical results suggest that the momentous structural change was cased and the @xmath0-value changed from greater than unity to unity at the beginning of 1990 when the speculative bubble collapsed in japan s stock markets .",
    "however , to date , no model so far has successfully explained such changes in the statistical properties of price fluctuations .",
    "hence the next step is to model such behavior in stock markets .",
