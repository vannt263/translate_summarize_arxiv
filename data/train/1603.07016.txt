    "the social media platform twitter is popular among scientists to share and discuss their professional thoughts and interests  @xcite .",
    "thus , they are a natural resource for building up a user s professional profile and using it for recommending scientific publications .",
    "recommending scientific publications based on a user s social media items has several advantages : first , users receive recommendations based on their current and ongoing professional interests . in contrast ,",
    "systems like google scholar and sugiyama et al .",
    "@xcite recommend scientific publications based on a user s publication record .",
    "it can take up to two years ( for conferences ) or longer ( for journals ) until a paper is taken into consideration by the recommender system .",
    "second , content - based profiling from a user s social media items mitigates the well - known cold - start problem observed in collaborative filtering systems  @xcite .",
    "the cold - start problem refers to the initial situation where a recommender system yet does not know anything about a user s interests .",
    "collaborative filtering systems need to analyze a large amount of user activities in order to provide reasonable recommendations .",
    "in contrast , content - based recommender systems like our work make recommendations based on similarity scores between a user profile and candidate items .",
    "therefore , they can generate recommendations based on a single user profile already .",
    "there is various research on user profiling from social media items  @xcite and recommending scientific publications  @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear how different profiling methods affect the recommendation performance . in addition",
    ", the age of social media items as well as scientific publications has an influence on profiling  @xcite . but",
    "again , it has not been compared .",
    "finally , we investigate whether it is possible to make reasonable recommendations when using only the publications titles , i.e. , when only short and sparse information about the candidate items is available .",
    "we have conducted an online experiment to evaluate these three factors of top-@xmath1 recommendations of scientific publications based on a user s social media profile . in detail , the factors are :    * ( i ) profiling method : * the first factor is the _ profiling method _",
    ", where we use concept frequency inverse document frequency ( cf - idf )  @xcite as baseline .",
    "cf - idf is a modification of tf - idf where term frequencies are replaced by frequencies of semantic concepts . in an experiment with 19 participants , goossen et al .",
    "have shown that cf - idf outperforms tf - idf for news article recommendations  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have extended the statistical strength of cf - idf with the semantics provided by a hierarchical knowledge base  @xcite .",
    "the resulting hierarchical cf - idf ( hcf - idf ) model is capable of revealing semantic concepts that are not explicitly mentioned in texts but still are highly relevant .",
    "this is achieved by applying a spreading activation over a hierarchical knowledge base , which is typically provided as domain - specific taxonomy .",
    "please note that we also considered using bm25 and tf - idf as profiling method .",
    "however , our earlier work showed that hcf - idf performs better for user profiling from social media items  @xcite .",
    "as third method , we apply latent dirichlet allocation ( lda )  @xcite , a state - of - the - art topic modeling method .",
    "lda is a generative machine learning approach and thus does not require any prior information such as a knowledge base .    *",
    "( ii ) decay function : * as the second factor , we investigate two temporal _ _ decay function__s .",
    "they are based on the idea that the importance of information declines gradually as time passes .",
    "we compare sliding window  @xcite and exponential decay  @xcite .",
    "both decay functions have been used in the past for user profiling  @xcite .",
    "but so far no comparative study was carried out .    *",
    "( iii ) document content : * the third factor defines the richness of _ document content _ used for profiling candidate items ( i.e. , scientific publications ) .",
    "we compare the use of full - texts and titles of scientific publications for profiling versus profiling only based on titles .",
    "we compared twelve recommendation strategies making use of different combinations of the three factors described above .",
    "for the experiment , we have recruited @xmath2 participants who are posting about their professional interests on twitter . for each strategy",
    ", the participants have received recommendations of five publications from a large corpus of @xmath3 scientific publications in the broader field of economics .",
    "we used rankscore  @xcite to measure the recommendation performance .",
    "we also computed mean average precision ( map ) , precision , mean reciprocal rank ( mrr ) , and normalized discounted cumulative gain ( ndcg ) , which show similar results and documented in the tr  @xcite .",
    "the results are very interesting : the strategy that employs the profiling method cf - idf and the decay function sliding window with both titles and full - texts achieves the overall best recommendation performance .",
    "although the strategy using cf - idf shows the highest performance , it has a drawback that it requires full - texts of scientific publications .",
    "thus , it is remarkable that the strategies with hcf - idf can achieve comparable results using only titles .",
    "we observe no significant difference between the best performing strategy and strategies with hcf - idf .",
    "thus , we conclude that the use of the spreading activation function over the hierarchical knowledge base enables hcf - idf to compensate for the sparseness when only titles are available due to e.g. , legal reasons to hinder the use of full - texts",
    ". please note , there is no lack in domain - specific hierarchical knowledge bases such as the one used in the experiment for economics .",
    "in fact , these knowledge bases are freely available for many domains .",
    "furthermore , they are manually crafted by domain experts and thus are of high quality .",
    "in addition , we have applied a correlation analysis between the recommendation performance and the number of tweets a participant has published , the number of concepts extracted from these tweets , the number of concepts extracted per tweet , and the percentage of tweets containing at least one concept respectively .",
    "our results show no significant correlations in any strategies .",
    "thus , the methods are robust against the amount of tweets .",
    "subsequently , we review related work in section  [ sec : related - work ] .",
    "section  [ sec : problem - definition ] introduces the problem definition . in section  [ sec : recommender - system ] , we describe the three experimental factors used in o4ur recommender system .",
    "we present the experiment setup and procedure in section  [ sec : evaluation ] .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] and discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] before we conclude the paper .",
    "recommender systems are categorized into content - based recommender and collaborative filtering  @xcite .",
    "collaborative filtering requires analyzing a large amount of user activities in order to predict items to other users  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we focus on content - based recommender , which suggest items based on similarity scores between a user profile and candidate items",
    ". a content - based recommender can make recommendations based on data from a single user already .",
    "thus it does not suffer from the cold start problem .",
    "recommender systems for scientific publications mostly employed user profiles based on publications  @xcite or clicks  @xcite . instead",
    ", we create user profiles based on social media items .",
    "many works have extracted user interests from social media platforms  @xcite .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite studied a recommender system incorporating twitter , which recommended urls based on a user s tweets and follower - followee relationships . in order to find out the best recommendation strategy",
    ", they evaluated twelve strategies from three factors : content sources , topic interest models for users , and social popularity . referring to the factor content sources , chen et al .",
    "showed that profiling based on one s own tweets performed better than based on tweets by one s followees .",
    "hence , we build up user profiles from social media items produced by the users themselves .    in the past years , profiling methods based on semantic concepts ( i.e. , ontology - based profiling ) extraction have been developed  @xcite .",
    "they extract semantic concepts from texts , using a structured knowledge base , e.g. , dbpedia .",
    "goossen et al .",
    "@xcite proposed cf - idf , as an extention of tf - idf .",
    "cf - idf counts frequencies of a concept instead of a term .",
    "their news arcticle recommendation experiment with @xmath4 participants demonstrated that cf - idf outperforms tf - idf .",
    "lu et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a recommender system for tweets based on what a user tweeted .",
    "they constructed user profiles represented as a set of weighted wikipedia concepts that correspond to wikipedia articles .",
    "the experiment demonstrated that concept - based approaches outperform tf - idf .",
    "other works employed a hierarchical structure of a knowledge base for profiling  @xcite and demonstrated their effectiveness .",
    "these approaches can reveal user interests that are not explicitly mentioned in the texts , using a structure of a knowledge base and spreading activation .",
    "in particular , middleton et al .  @xcite constructed user profiles based on a hierarchical knowledge base using spreading activation for a recommender system of scientific publications .",
    "their user experiment compared a profiling method using the structure of a hierarchical knowledge base and a method not using the structure .",
    "the result demonstrated superiority of using the hierarchical knowledge base .",
    "topic modeling such as lda  @xcite is one of the most popular profiling methods .",
    "it is used in the context of social media  @xcite but particularly suited for document profiling .",
    "time - aware user profiles are constructed based on the assumption that the degree of user interests declines as time passes .",
    "the decline of user interests is modeled by a decay function . in the past ,",
    "the decay functions sliding window  @xcite and exponential decay  @xcite have been employed for user profiling .",
    "however , they have not been compared so far like we do in this work .",
    "we address the problem of taking the social media stream as input in order to recommend items such as scientific publications the user might be interested in .",
    "the problem can be decomposed into three parts : ( 1 )  first , we need to extract the professional interests that a user exposes through his social media stream and represent the interests in a user profile .",
    "( 2 )  likewise , we profile candidate items ( i.e. , scientific publications ) and represent them in a way that they are comparable with the user profile .",
    "( 3 )  we need a ranking function to compute the top-@xmath1 items based on similarity scores between the user profile and each candidate item . in the following , we formalize the three steps required to create a recommender system based on a user s professional interests extracted from the social media stream .",
    "symbols used in this paper are summarized in table  [ tb : notation ] .    *",
    "( 1 ) user profiling from social media items .",
    "* we consider @xmath5 as set of social media items @xmath6 produced by user @xmath7 . a social media item @xmath8 has a certain time stamp @xmath9 .",
    "subsequently , @xmath10 , the user profile of the user @xmath7 , is created over a set of concepts @xmath11 by assigning a specific weight for each concept @xmath12 . generally speaking , a concept @xmath13 is a key subject in a dedicated field , coming from a given domain - specific knowledge base @xmath11 .",
    "for instance ,  financial crisis  is a concept in the field of economics .",
    "we construct @xmath14 by employing different user profiling functions @xmath15 and we compare them . formally , user profiles are defined as : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is an arbitrary weighting function that returns a weight of a concept @xmath13 in a user s social media stream @xmath18 .",
    "thus , it determines how important a concept @xmath13 is for the user @xmath7 . profiling functions @xmath15 and weighting functions @xmath17 are described in sections  [ sec : profiling - method ] and [ sec : temporal - decay - function ] .",
    "specifically , we describe weighting functions @xmath19 that do not consider temporal decay in section  [ sec : profiling - method ] and provide weighting functions @xmath17 which extend @xmath19 with temporal decay in section  [ sec : temporal - decay - function ] .    *",
    "( 2 ) profiling candidate items .",
    "* we have a set of candidate items @xmath20 . a candidate item @xmath21 has a time stamp @xmath22 , indicating its published year .",
    "to determine the similarity scores between a user profile @xmath14 and each candidate item @xmath21 , we need to construct profiles of candidate items in a way that they are comparable with the user profile .",
    "formally , we represent a candidate item @xmath23 as a profile @xmath24 .",
    "since our candidate items are scientific publications , we refer to this process document profiling ."
