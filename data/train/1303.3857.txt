    "several authors have developed methods to count permutations avoiding a given set of patterns ; see , for example , the references in the wikipedia entry @xcite . in particular ,",
    "enumeration schemes have been developed for automated counting @xcite .",
    "when successful , an automated method produces an enumeration scheme that yields the initial terms of the counting sequence ( perhaps 20 or more ) and sometimes these terms appear to have an algebraic that does not follow readily from the enumeration scheme . here , we treat one such case .",
    "the counting sequence for permutations that avoid both of the ( classical ) patterns 1243 and 2134 begins @xmath1 , sequence in the on - line encyclopedia of integer sequences @xcite . in a comment on this sequence dated oct 24 2012 , vaclav kotesovec observed that the @xmath2 fits the known terms of the sequence .",
    "we will show that @xmath0-avoiders do indeed have this . defining a  _ start - small _ permutation to be one that does not start with its largest entry , the proof rests on a bijection @xmath3 from start - small of length @xmath4 to lists of 123-avoiders",
    "whose total length is @xmath5the length of the list . under this bijection @xmath3 , for example , @xmath6 , a list of length 4 with total length of its entries @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , a singleton list .",
    "now , 123-avoiders are famously counted by the catalan numbers and the well known combinatorial interpretation of the transform @xmath9 , defined via generating functions by @xmath10 permits counting these lists of 123-avoiders .",
    "the for start - small thus obtained readily yields the for unrestricted .    in section 2 , we show that @xmath3 is given by iteration of a more basic bijection , which is presented in section 3 .",
    "finally , section 4 gives the bookkeeping details to obtain the desired from @xmath3 .",
    "a  _ mid-123 _ entry in a permutation is an entry that serves as the `` 2 '' in a 123 pattern .",
    "a  _ key _",
    "mid-123 entry is a mid-123 entry @xmath11 whose immediate predecessor is either @xmath12 or a right - to - left maximum ( max for short ) .",
    "for example , the mid-123 entries in 134526 are 3,4,5,2 but only 3,4 , and 5 are key .",
    "[ key ] a permutation with no key mid-@xmath13 entries has no mid-@xmath13 entries at all and so is a @xmath13-avoider .",
    "suppose the @xmath14th entry @xmath15 of a permutation @xmath16 is a mid-123 entry but not key .",
    "then , by definition of key , we have @xmath17 and @xmath18 is not a .",
    "so @xmath18 is also a mid-123 entry .",
    "again , if @xmath18 is not key , then @xmath19 and @xmath20 is not a .",
    "iterating this process , we must eventually arrive at a key mid-123 entry .",
    "hence , every permutation with a mid-123 entry has a key mid-123 entry .",
    "[ uniquec ] suppose @xmath11 is the last mid-@xmath13 entry in a . then there is a unique @xmath21 such that @xmath22 forms the of a @xmath13 pattern .    proof .",

    "if @xmath21 precedes @xmath27 in the permutation , then @xmath21 is a mid-123 , violating the hypothesis on @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath21 follows @xmath27 , then @xmath28 is a proscribed 1243 .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the set of on @xmath30 $ ] , and @xmath31 the subset with @xmath32 key mid-123 entries .",
    "to produce the promised bijection @xmath3 from @xmath29 to lists of 123-avoiders whose total length is @xmath5the length of the list , it suffices to exhibit , for @xmath33 , a bijection @xmath34    & \\textrm{lengths of the $ \\si_{i}$ 's sum to $ n+k$}\\big\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath35 , naturally the bijection is @xmath36 , a singleton list , because , by lemma [ key ] , @xmath16 is already 123-avoiding . for @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "let @xmath39 the result of the next section extracts from a that _ does _ contain 123 s two , both  , the first with _ one fewer _",
    "key mid-123 entries than the original and the second with _ no _ key mid-123 entries .",
    "iteration then gives the desired bijection @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath40 , there is a bijection @xmath41    proof . given @xmath42",
    ", we need to reversibly produce @xmath43 and @xmath44 . write @xmath16 as @xmath45 where @xmath11 is the last mid-123 entry in @xmath16 , and let @xmath23 be the 123 pattern in @xmath16 with smallest @xmath46 ( @xmath21 is uniquely determined by lemma [ uniquec ] ) .",

    "this @xmath50 may need further processing because of two glitches : @xmath50 may still have @xmath32 key mid-123 s instead of the required @xmath52 and @xmath50 can not end with its smallest entry ( which must be possible in @xmath51 ) .",
    "but these glitches cancel out",
    ".    if @xmath11 is a key mid-123 in @xmath16 , then @xmath50 has @xmath52 key mid-123 s because @xmath11 has been lost . in this case , just standardize @xmath50 to get @xmath51 . otherwise , the last entry of @xmath49 exceeds @xmath11 but is not a .",
    "delete from @xmath50 the longest terminal string of @xmath49 that is decreasing but does not contain a of @xmath16 ( equivalently , does not contain an entry @xmath53 ) ; say @xmath54 entries are deleted .",
    "add @xmath55 to each remaining entry of @xmath50 , append the entries @xmath56 and standardize to obtain @xmath51 .",
    "for example , for @xmath57 , we find that the last mid-123 , @xmath58 , is a key mid-123 , and @xmath59 .",
    "so @xmath60 standardize@xmath61 and @xmath62 standardize@xmath63 .    as another example",
    ", for @xmath64 , we find that the last mid-123 , @xmath65 , is _ not _ key , and @xmath66 .",
    "so @xmath60 standardize@xmath67 . here , @xmath68 and the longest decreasing terminal string of @xmath49 that does not contain a of @xmath16 has length @xmath69 .",
    "so @xmath62 standardize@xmath70 standardize@xmath71 .",
    "the invertibility of this map rests on structural properties of evident in the matrix diagrams above : consider scanning the entries leftward from the last mid-123 entry @xmath11 . in case @xmath11 is key , as long as these entries decrease , they decrease by 1 ( in square box at center of yellow region ) . in",
    "case @xmath11 is not key , they increase by 1 until either an entry @xmath53 , a decrease , or a jump @xmath72 to an entry @xmath73 occurs . in the latter case ,",
    "the `` missing '' entries in the jump occur in increasing order immediately to the left of the jump ( again in square box at center of yellow region ) . in both cases ,",
    "the gray regions are empty except for the `` @xmath46 '' and `` @xmath21 '' , and the yellow square box is bisected by the main diagonal .",
    "the preceding observations , all immediate consequences of the patterns 1243 and 2134 being proscribed and @xmath11 being the last mid-123 , validate the following description of the inverse map . for a permutation @xmath74",
