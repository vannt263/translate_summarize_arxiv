    "we analyse the effects of kaluza - klein@xcite excitations on @xmath4 in theories with large radius compactifications@xcite .",
    "such theories are currently being investigated because they might arise in the strong coupling limit of the heterotic string which can yield a string scale in the tev region@xcite .",
    "the framework of the model we work in is discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "our view point is that the fields of the minimal supersymmetric standard model reside in ( 4+d ) dimensions while gravity propagates in the 10 dimensional bulk . in the language of type",
    "i string the mssm fields reside on p=3+d branes and we consider compactifications internal to the brane .",
    "our analysis is in the framework of an effective field theory and we illustrate our procedure for the standard model ( sm ) case for d=5 . here",
    "our sm fields will consist of gauge fields @xmath5 ( m=0,1,2,3,5 ) , the higgs multiplet @xmath6 , and the quarks and lepton multiplets .",
    "we assume a form of v(h ) such that h develops a vacuum expectation value and spontaneous breaking of the electro - weak symmetry takes place so that @xmath7 .",
    "we next choose a five dimensional gauge fixing term of the form @xmath8 in this gauge the bilinear term involving @xmath5 and @xmath9 form a total divergence of the @xmath10 and hence can be dropped .",
    "the remaining terms in the lagrangian have a simple decomposition among the vector bosons , the higgs and the fictitious goldstone bosons . after spontaneous breaking",
    "we compactify the lagrangian on @xmath11 with a radius of compactification r.    we shall assume that the higgs and the gauge fields live in the five dimensional bulk and the fermions live at one of the orbifold points .",
    "thus we will have only zero modes for the fermion fields in this case .",
    "for the 4d lagrangian we shall work in the @xmath12 gauge . in this gauge ,",
    "terms bilinear in @xmath13 and @xmath14 form a total divergence in 4 dimensions and the @xmath15 and @xmath14 decouple at the bilinear level . to normalize the 4d lagrangian a redefinition of the couplings is needed , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "normal mode decomposition on @xmath11 indicates mass terms for the w bosons of @xmath17 , n=0,1,2, ..",
    ",@xmath18 , where the first term arises from spontaneous breaking of the electro - weak symmetry and the second term arises from the compactification , and similar relations hold for the kaluza - klein excitations of the z boson and for the higgs boson .",
    "the above analysis can be extended to include supersymmetry . before compactification",
    "this 5d theory has an n=2 supersymmetry .",
    "after compactification the massless sector of the theory has n=1 supersymmetry while the massive kaluza - klein states maintain an n=2 supersymmetry .",
    "the model can be extended to d dimensions .",
    "the framework of the analysis is as in ref.@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the one loop contribution to @xmath0 can be carried out in the usual fashion and a finite contribution arises from each kaluza - klein mode . neglecting the relatively small contributions from the yukawa couplings , the contributions to @xmath0 at the one loop level from the w and z exchange and from their kaluza - klein excitations for d extra dimensions",
    "is given by    @xmath19    here @xmath20=(@xmath4 - 2)/2 , @xmath21 is the fermi constant as evaluated in the standard model , @xmath22 is the weak angle , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the w ( z ) boson mass , @xmath25 is the common mass scale at which the extra dimensions open up , and the function @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 here @xmath28 for complex @xmath29 is given by @xmath28= @xmath30@xmath31 where ( @xmath32 ) . in the limit c=0",
    "one has @xmath33 and eq.(2 ) reduces to the standard model result@xcite . for the case d=1 eq.(3 )",
    "gives a convergent result .",
    "however , a cuttoff @xmath34 on the lower limit of the integral in eq.(3 ) is needed for the case @xmath35 . as discussed in ref.@xcite this cutoff",
    "is determined consistently by comparison with the truncation on the sum over the kaluza - klein states so that only the states up to the string scale are retained in the sum .",
    "one finds the following results for @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36    as discussed in ref.@xcite one must carry out a redefinition of the fermi constant because of the dressing of the kaluza - klein states and the experimentally observed @xmath37 is to be identified as    @xmath38    using this redefinition we find the contribution of the kaluza - klein modes to @xmath20 is @xmath39 for d=1 @xmath40 is given approximately by @xmath41 while the @xmath35 cases require a cutoff as discussed above and one finds that the following results give a good approximation    @xmath42",
    "in the above we computed the contributions arising from the w and z kaluza - klein excitations to @xmath20 .",
    "there are also contributions to @xmath20 arising from the exchange of the kaluza - klein excitations of the photon . here",
    "our analysis gives for the d extra dimensions the result    @xmath43    where @xmath44 as for the case of the w and z kaluza - klein exchange contributions , for d=1 the photonic kaluza - klein exchange contribution is finite while a cutoff is needed for higher values of d. the cutoff is introduced in the same way as discussed for the case @xmath45 and one gets the following results for various cases    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    the total kaluza - klein exchange contribution to @xmath20 is the sum of the contribution from the w and z kaluza - klein exchange contribution and from the photonic w and z exchange contribution @xmath49 we note that after redefinition of the fermi constant the w and z kaluza - klein exchange contribution @xmath50 as given by eq.(6 ) is negative while the photonic kaluza - klein exchange contribution @xmath51 as given by eq.(8 ) is positive .",
    "thus one has a partial cancellation between these two contributions .",
    "we emphasize here that in any numerical analysis of eq.(13 ) the constraints arising from eq.(5 ) ( which holds only within the current error bars of @xmath21 and experiment on @xmath37 ) should be included .",
    "for the compactifications considered here and in ref.@xcite these constraints on @xmath52 at the @xmath53 level are @xmath54 tev@xcite for d=1 , @xmath55 tev for d=2 , @xmath56 tev for d=3 and @xmath57 tev for d=4 .",
    "we discuss now the prospects for the observation of the kaluza - klein contributions in @xmath4 experiment . for this purpose",
    "we review first the current situation on @xmath20 .",
    "the current experimental value of @xmath20 is  @xcite : @xmath59 , where the quantity in the parenthesis is the uncertainty while the corresponding uncertainty in the theoretical determinations is significantly smaller .",
    "the most recent standard model prediction for @xmath20 is @xmath60 .",
    "this result includes @xmath61 qed contributions@xcite , the hadronic vacuum polarization@xcite and light by light hadronic contributions@xcite , and the standard model electro - weak contributions@xcite .",
    "essentially all of the uncertainty in the standard model result arises from the hadronic contributions which include the hadronic vacuum polarization  @xcite , and the light by light hadronic contribution  @xcite .",
    "the total standard model electro - weak contribution up to two loops  @xcite is given by @xmath62 .    the new @xmath4 brookhaven experiment e821@xcite will be able to reduce the current experimental uncertainty by a factor of 20 to a level of @xmath63 . with this sensitivity the new @xmath4 experiment will be able to test the standard model electro - weak contribution even with the current level of uncertainty in the hadronic contributions .",
    "infact the experiment will be able to probe @xmath20 to a level of @xmath64 ( where we have combined the experimental error and the hadronic error in quadrature ) .",
    "further , it is expected that the uncertainty in the hadronic error may reduce even more by perhaps as much as a factor of 2 from the data from the ongoing and future precision low energy experiments at vepp-2 m , da@xmath65ne and bepc .",
    "of course a further reduction of the hadronic error will sharpen the ability of the brookhaven experiment to probe new physics .    in the analysis of @xmath66 we impose the gauge coupling unification to constrain the ratio @xmath67 the details of which",
    "are discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the results are displayed in fig.1 .",
    "the analysis exhibits a sharp dependence of the contribution of the kaluza - klein excitations to @xmath66 on the number of extra space time dimensions .",
    "the sharp dependence on d arises from the summation over the number of kaluza - klein states because of the combinatorics factors .",
    "as discussed already there is a partial cancellation between the w and z kaluza - klein exchange contribution and the photonic kaluza - klein exchange contribution after a redefinition of the fermi constant is taken into account . as discussed above and in ref.@xcite",
    "the analysis of the kaluza - klein mode contribution to @xmath37 gives strong constraints on @xmath52 .",
    "fig.1 shows that with these constraints on @xmath52 the new @xmath4 experiment will not come even close to exploring the extra dimensions , ie .",
    ", the total kaluza - klein contribution falls more than 1 - 2 orders of magnitude below the sensitivity that will be achievable in the new @xmath4 experiment .    in the above we assumed that all the quark - lepton generations lie on the 4-dimensional wall .",
    "we discuss now a variant of the model considered above where the first quark - lepton generation lies on the wall while the second quark - lepton generation lives in the bulk . in this case",
    "the first quark - lepton generation will have no couplings with the kaluza - klein modes while the second generation will have such couplings . in this model",
    "the process @xmath1 receives no kaluza - klein correction at the tree level and thus @xmath37 is uncorrected at this level .",
    "similarly in this case the atomic parity violating interactions receive no kaluza - klein corrections . consequently there are no constraints arising at the tree level from the experimental accuracy of @xmath37 and from the atomic parity experiments on @xmath52 , although corrections at the loop level can arise which are , however , expected to be much smaller than what one would otherwise expect .",
    "other experimental bounds as those arising from contact interactions using lep data are also evaded in this model .",
    "further , one would also expect here a significant suppression of the production of the kaluza - klein excitations of the w and the z boson at the @xmath68 colliders due to the dominance of the first generation in the quark content of p(@xmath69 )",
    ". however , kaluza - klein corrections to @xmath0 in this model are not suppressed and the analysis of @xmath66 in this case is given in fig.2 again under the unification of the gauge coupling constant constraint .",
    "( the analysis uses eq.2 with the measured value of @xmath21 ) .",
    "the analysis of fig.2 shows that the new @xmath4 experiment will be able to probe two extra dimensions up to scales @xmath70 tev , three extra dimensions up to scales @xmath71 tev , and four extra dimensions up to scales @xmath72 tev .",
    "we note that the scales which can be explored well exceed the mass bound on the kaluza - klein modes of the quarks inferred from the fourth generation quark searches which gives a lower limit of @xmath73 gev@xcite .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the effects of kaluza - klein excitations arising from extra dimensions with large radius compactifications on @xmath0 .",
    "these effects consist of the photonic kaluza - klein exchange contribution and of the w and z exchange contribution . for the case of one extra dimension",
    "the kaluza - klein contribution to @xmath20 is finite .",
    "however , a cutoff is necessary for the case of d extra dimensions , @xmath35 . we have derived approximate relations for the kaluza - klein contributions for these cases ( see eqs .",
    "6,7,10 - 12 ) .",
    "for d=2 these approximate relations are accurate to @xmath74 while for @xmath75 the relations are accurate to @xmath76 . we have given a quantitative analysis of the contributions of the kaluza - klein excitations of @xmath77 , w and z under the constraints of the unification of the gauge coupling constants .",
    "our analysis shows that for the case when all the quark - lepton generations lie on the 4d wall , inclusion of the constraints on @xmath52 arising from the analysis of kaluza - klein mode contributions to @xmath37 lead to effects on @xmath0 which are too small to be observable by the new @xmath4 experiment .",
    "we also considered a model where the first generation lives in the bulk and the second generation lies on the wall . in this case effects from extra dimensions @xmath35 may become visible in the brookhaven experiment . furthermore , a muon collider may be able to explore these extra dimensions directly .",
    "of course a fundamental string model will have to justify such an assignment of generations between the bulk and the wall .",
    "after completion of this work there appeared a paper@xcite where an analysis of the effects of kaluza - klein excitations of gauge bosons on @xmath0 is also given .",
    "however , the constraints arising from the effects of kaluza - klein corrections to the fermi constant are not included .",
