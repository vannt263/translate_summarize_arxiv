    "shells are sharp - edged features , formed during interactions and mergers , through phase - wrapping of debris ( quinn 1984 , dupraz & combes 1986 , hernquist & quinn 1989 ) .",
    "recent hi observations have revealed the existence of associated gaseous shells , slightly displaced from the stellar ones , questioning the validity of the phase - wrapping mechanism ( centaurus a : schiminovich et al 1994 ; ngc 2865 : schiminovich et al 1995 ; ngc 1210 : petric et al 1997 ) .",
    "an intriguing result is that the hi shells follow the curvature of the stellar shells , but are shifted about 1kpc outside .",
    "there are two ways shells can be formed : * -(1)- * in minor mergers , shells correspond to phase - wrapping of the stars liberated from the small companion ( e.g. quinn 1984 ) ; * -(2)- * in major mergers , shells correspond to phase - wrapping of the debris falling back into the merged - object potential ( hernquist & spergel 1992 , hibbard & mihos 1995 ) . but what is the fate of gas ?",
    "due to dissipation , it falls towards the center , as in the simulations of weil & hernquist ( 1993 ) , and there should not exist gaseous shells .",
    "there exists a population of small and dense gas clouds , that have very low dissipation .",
    "this gas has a behaviour intermediate between stars and diffuse gas , and remains available to form shells .",
    "already kojima & noguchi ( 1997 ) have simulated the sinking of a disk satellite into an elliptical , with a sticky particle code , instead of sph , and found no segregation between gas and stars .",
    "we have also simulated the phenomenon , with a cloud - cloud collision code , to be able to control the dissipation rate .    with strong dissipation , the gas component , after a few oscillations back and forth in the primary s potential , settles in the center , as previously .",
    "but with small dissipation , only a small fraction of the gas falls into the potential well , most of it form shells ( cf figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "now it is necessary to explain the spatial displacement between the gaseous and stellar shells .",
    "two possibilities could be tested : * -(1)- * the gas in the companion is not as bound , and does not occupy the same region initially , being in the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "we simulate this , but this results in only a very slight and negligible shift . * -(2)- * in the merging , the gas is liberated early from the companion by the tidal forces , since it is not very bound , while the stars are liberated afterwards . through dynamical friction , the stars have therefore time to lose a lot of energy , contrary to the gas .",
    "dynamical friction also explains the dynamical range of the shell radii ( dupraz & combes 1987 ) .",
    "this second possibility accounts very well for the shift observed between hi and stellar shells , according to simulations .",
    "to check the model , millimeter observations have been carried out , to detect molecular gas in shells , since the dense clumps able to form shells should be on h@xmath0 form .",
    "this led to the surprising detection of co with the sest 15m - telescope in centaurus - a shells ( charmandaris , combes , van der hulst 1999 ) .",
    "there are comparable amounts of h@xmath0 and hi gas in the shells , far away from the galaxy center ( 15 kpc ) , which is completely unusual for a normal galaxy .",
    "this is compatible with the view that the dense clumps have been dragged in the shells by the phase - wrapping mechanism , and the hi diffuse gas has been photo- dissociated from there ."
