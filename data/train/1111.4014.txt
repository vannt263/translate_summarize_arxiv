    "a scale - invariant spectrum of gravitational radiation is a key prediction of inflation @xcite . measuring the ratio of the amplitude of gravitational radiation to the amplitude of density perturbations , @xmath0 , would be a direct probe of the inflationary energy scale . such a measurement has eluded observation in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) thus far @xcite and represents one of the key goals of future cmb observational missions @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "some authors have argued that phase transitions can mimic the scale - invariant inflationary signal @xcite .",
    "the mechanism through which this is accomplished is not trivial .",
    "the phase transition itself is not the source .",
    "rather , energy is deposited into gravitational radiation via the self - ordering of fields as regions of spacetime become causally connected .",
    "the process begins with @xmath1 scalar fields , @xmath2 , subject to a temperature dependent potential , @xmath3 . at high temperatures",
    "the potential looks quadratic with a single minimum at the origin .",
    "this state has @xmath4 symmetry since the state is symmetric any any rotation in the @xmath1-dimensional field space .",
    "once the potential drops below a critical temperature , the field acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "this process spontaneously breaks the @xmath5 to a @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the transition can be very fast , with a duration , @xmath7 , that is much smaller than the hubble time , @xmath8 .",
    "the field configuration of each hubble volume will lie somewhere in the vacuum state , however each causally disconnected volume will be independent of the others",
    ". this process can be quite smooth , and there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe such a process radiates .",
    "however , if the universe is radiation ( and later matter ) dominated after the transition , the growth of the comoving hubble scale continuously brings previously causally disconnected regions into contact .",
    "regions thus acquire field gradients on the scale of the hubble horizon .",
    "these gradients generate anisotropic stresses that source gravitational waves .",
    "the growth of the horizon acts as a high - pass filter on the spectrum of gravitational waves , _ freezing out _ large - wavelength modes until they enter the horizon and become dynamical . as the horizon grows power",
    "is distributed at all scales between the physical horizon size at the time of the transition , @xmath9 , and the horizon size at the time of observation .    in all previous studies",
    ", authors have relied on large-@xmath1 approximations in order to calculate the gravitational wave signal .",
    "here we make no such approximation and approach the problem numerically .",
    "we place @xmath1 scalar fields on a lattice evolving in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker background .",
    "each lattice point is initialized with a field value derived from thermal initial conditions .",
    "if we allow the lattice spacing to be @xmath10 at the beginning of the simulation each lattice point will settle into an independent position in the vacuum manifold .",
    "as the simulation progresses , the fields will evolve and align themselves .",
    "this self - ordering produces anisotropic stresses that source gravitational waves .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ gsb ]",
    "we will introduce a toy model of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "we outline our computational methods in section  [ gwp ] and present the spectra we calculate in our simulations . in section  [ discussion ] we will comment on the differences between the spectra we predict from self - ordering and the spectrum produced during inflation .",
    "the gut scale naturally arises from particle physics as the scale at which the electroweak and strong couplings are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "it is likely that these forces are unified under some larger symmetry above the gut scale and that this symmetry is broken as the universe cools .",
    "nevertheless , the nature of the gut symmetry and how it is broken remains unknown",
    ".    the transition could be first - order , in which case bubbles of the broken phase nucleate and coalesce . in this model",
    "the phase transition happens very rapidly  the entirety of the universe can end up in a unique state in less than a hubble time .",
    "this process is likely to produce gravitational radiation @xcite as bubbles collide and coalesce .",
    "conversely , the phase transition could be second - order . in this case the field smoothly transitions to the broken phase as the temperature of the universe drops .",
    "if the broken phase is not unique , that is if the vacuum state has some symmetry with respect to the field configuration , the effects of the _ existence _ of this phase transition can lead to observational effects for many hubble times .",
    "we begin with two assumptions : ( 1 ) that the universe is radiation dominated at the time when the phase transition occurs , and ( 2 ) that the energy associated with the fields undergoing the phase transition is some small fraction , @xmath11 , of the total energy density at the time of the transition , @xmath12 . the total density , at any time , is @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 since the universe is necessarily dominated by the radiation energy - density , we will only consider cases where @xmath16 so that the universe is well described by assuming @xmath17 .    the potential in eq .",
    "( [ tdeppot ] ) is temperature dependent . to leading order in temperature , @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the temperature dependent effective mass can be parameterized by @xmath20 at temperatures higher than the critical temperature , @xmath21 , the effective mass is positive , the potential has a unique minimum at the origin , and this minimum has full @xmath4 symmetry , and at the origin @xmath22 after the phase transition the potential has an @xmath6 symmetric vev @xmath23    the phase transition occurs at the critical temperature , @xmath21 , when the effective mass of the field vanishes .",
    "although the field has a mean value , @xmath24 , there is a variance associated with this value , @xmath25 that sets the distribution of field values at the time of the transition .",
    "we can assume that at this time , each hubble volume ( sphere of radius @xmath9 ) has a homogeneous field value , drawn from a gaussian distribution ( see appendix  [ thermal ] ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 where the second equality comes from setting @xmath28 .",
    "the temperature of the universe at the beginning of the simulation , @xmath21 , is related to the energy density of the universe at that time , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of ultra - relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of the phase transition .",
    "we take @xmath31 .    the average energy density in the field is well approximated by setting @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , @xmath32 which is some fraction , @xmath11 , of the total energy density @xmath33 this constrains the value of the vev , @xmath34 this provides us with a good self - consistency check , namely , that the variance of the fluctuations of the filed are small compared to the vev , @xmath35 .",
    "this ratio is given by @xmath36 which is , in general , less that one if @xmath37 is significantly below @xmath38 and @xmath11 and @xmath39 are of similar order .",
    "evolving scalar fields on a discrete lattice is now a mature field of study .",
    "scalar fields were first introduced to the lattice , in a cosmological context , by latticeeasy  @xcite and later by defrost @xcite to study the non - linear dynamics of preheating after inflation .",
    "more recently the authors of @xcite re - framed the question by moving the fundamental description of the fields from configuration space to momentum space .",
    "even more recently the author of @xcite introduced a versatile code that allows the user more control over the integrating scheme .",
    "here we chose to use latticeeasy since we are interested in sub- and super - horizon scales , large lattices with efficient storage and a specific associated potential , eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "this software natively evolves scalar fields according to the klein - gordon equation in an expanding background , @xmath40 where we work in units where @xmath41 .",
    "the homogeneous background evolution is determined by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the homogeneous , average , energy density at time @xmath44 .",
    "we couple latticeeasy to a code that evolves the metric perturbation using the methods of  @xcite .",
    "since the lattice realizes the fields at discrete values of time , it is most convenient to perturb the metric , @xmath45 , in a synchronous gauge @xmath46dx^idx^j.\\ ] ] additionally , the radiative part of @xmath45 obeys the transverse - traceless conditions @xmath47 the radiative perturbations obey sourced klein - gordon equations @xmath48 where the source term , @xmath49 is the transverse - traceless projection of the anisotropic stress tensor , @xmath50    we specify our model eq .  ( [ potential ] ) and allow latticeeasy to evolve the fields and the scale factor .",
    "we can then calculate the source term of eq .",
    "( [ equationofmotion ] ) , and evolve the six metric perturbations , @xmath51 .",
    "we can always check our numerical stability by checking to see if the metric perturbations are still transverse - traceless ; transverse - traceless metric perturbations require _ both _ a transverse - traceless source and accurate evolution .    at any point during the simulation",
    ", we can calculate the power spectrum of gravitational radiation .",
    "the stress - energy associated with metric perturbations is @xcite , @xmath52 where the brackets denote a spatial average over at least a few wavelengths .",
    "the @xmath53 component is the energy density , @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "finally , we can invoke parseval s theorem ( see @xcite ) to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ gwdensity ] ) as @xmath56 where @xmath3 is the comoving volume over which the spatial average is being performed .",
    "we can then write @xmath57 which can be transferred to present - day amplitude and frequency by  @xcite , @xmath58 where the @xmath59 and @xmath60 subscripts denote quantities defined today and the end of our simulations , respectively .",
    "we also keep the convention that @xmath61 absorbs the uncertainty in the present value of the hubble parameter , @xmath62 is the current fraction of the energy density in the form of radiation , and @xmath63 is the total energy density at the end of our simulations . the ratio , @xmath64 , is the number of degrees of freedom today to the number of degrees of freedom at matter / radiation equality .",
    "we approximate @xmath65 .",
    "the first major difference between the _ structure _ of the gravitational - wave spectrum from self - ordering and that predicted by inflation is the lack of power at high - frequencies .",
    "this cut - off feature exists because we only considering larger then hubble length fluctuations as sources of gravitational waves as there will be no / short lived gradient terms to source the gravitational waves inside the hubble volumes by second order phase transitions .",

    "[ fig : ncomparison ] .",
    "the characteristic amplitude and scale invariant nature of the spectrum was expected from the analytical approach of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spectrum is scale invariant for all the cases in fig .",
    "[ fig : ncomparison ] , including those for @xmath73 ; the analytical methods employed by @xcite assumed that @xmath1 is large .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : soucomparison ] we observe two important scaling effects .",
    "first , we recover the fact that the high - frequency cutoff predicted by eq .  [ peakeq ] scales with @xmath74 .",
    "we also see that the amplitude of the signal is proportional to the energy density of the universe at the time of the transition , @xmath75 this scaling is also suggested predicted in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a final step is to compare the numerical results here with the analytic arguments of @xcite and @xcite . in both cases",
    "the authors use the model presented here to estimate the gravitational wave signal from reordering .",
    "the two sets of authors use slightly different parameterizations of the model ; however , all authors arrive at the conclusion that there should be a scale - invariant gravitational wave spectrum from this transition    in @xcite , the authors estimate the power in gravitational waves from field reordering to be ( eq .

    "since there is no unique model of physics at this scale , we are forced to look for generic observational consequences at this scale .",
    "second order phase transitions will not produce gravitational radiation over one hubble time , yet the reordering of the fields that mediate the transition could produce characteristic gravitational radiation over a wide range of scales . although this signature could be misinterpreted as the gravitational radiation from primordial quantum fluctuations , it might be possible to distinguish the two at very high frequencies",
