    "after hubble discovery of the cosmic expansion , people needed to make black hole models which are embedded in the expanding friedmann - lematre - robertson walker background .",
    "the 1933 mcvittie solution @xcite was the first attempt to model the point mass black hole in the cosmological background . the mcvittie black hole is embedded in a general flrw background , so that the region between the black hole horizon and cosmological horizon is evolving .",
    "even though this model was used for different black hole modelings , this metric has some basic problems @xcite @xcite @xcite . in this way",
    ", some metrics @xcite which are introduced can not present comprehensive properties of the horizon , singularity or matter type .",
    "+ the main criticism for these metrics is that they manufacture the geometry and attribute it to the black hole models . with this action ,",
    "matter in the right hand side of the einstein equation will be restricted , and the black hole horizon and singularity change their position and properties generally . the standard way to derive",
    "a metric is to know its matter field and its symmetry .",
    "along this way lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) model was introduced which describe the perfect fluid collapse in the spherically symmetric space time @xcite .",
    "apart from its dynamical nature , the flrw is a special case of this metric and can be modeled as a background .",
    "since the geometry is not static , the need for a local definition of black holes and their boundaries ( horizons ) have led to concepts such as an isolated horizon @xcite , ashtekar and krishnan s dynamical horizon @xcite , and booth and fairhurst s slowly evolving horizon @xcite .",
    "inspired by these ltb metric properties , the cosmological black hole ( cbh ) can be built @xcite that its singularity and horizon is formed during collapse .",
    "+ in many respects a cbh shows different properties relative to the stationary black holes .",
    "the first evident difference is that in the cbh at least two horizons appear in the model : first the apparent horizon and second the cosmological horizon @xcite , and the causal structure of the black hole will be different from stationary one .",
    "second , the mass definition of the black hole will need to be extended to the quasi - local masses @xcite rather than like a adm mass .",
    "even though the hawking radiation from the stationary black hole is revised for cbh case @xcite .",
    "now , the question arise as to whether a cbh can be useful relative to the schwarzschild ( stationary metrics ) one .",
    "the first cbh application is in the primordial black hole modeling @xcite .",
    "these black holes form when the flrw background density perturbations exceed some threshold values in the radiation dominated era .",
    "moreover , mcvittie cbh is used to model the cosmological defect in the inflationary phase @xcite .",
    "the second cbh application is to model the structure in the matter dominated era @xcite where these models were used to investigate the dark energy , virialization , rotation curve and week - lensing , etc .",
    "+ in this paper , in section ii we infer the point mass cbh form a big class of cbh which can be used for cosmological structure .",
    "section iii , iv and v is devoted to make a point mass cbh in presence of mass , mass - charge and mass - angular momentum .",
    "then , in section vi we study these black holes mass , horizon , redshift structures and geodesics properties . the conclusion and discussions",
    "are given in section vii .",
    "the main feature of a dynamical black hole is its matter flux .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the black hole apparent horizon growth is proportional to the matter flux which falls to it .",
    "here we are interested in the case that the black hole evolves slowly due to the matter flux .",
    "first we introduce the dynamical case @xcite which is a general slowly evolving horizon and then we consider the slowly evolving case .",
    "geometry of the apparent horizon @xmath0 is expressed by the unit normal to @xmath0 by @xmath1 ; @xmath2 .",
    "the unit space - like vector orthogonal to @xmath3 and tangent to @xmath0 is represented by @xmath4 .",
    "the rescaling freedom in the choice of null normals will be fixed via @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we introduce the area radius @xmath7 , a function which is constant on each @xmath3 and satisfies @xmath8 .",
    "now , the 3-volume @xmath9 on @xmath0 can be decomposed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the gradient on @xmath0 . hence , as we will see , our calculations will simplify if we choose @xmath12 .",
    "we define the flux of energy associated with @xmath13 across @xmath14 as : @xmath15 in the spherically symmetric case @xmath16 is the misner - sharp mass @xcite . with calculating this quantity on the apparent horizon |_ah=(m+ ) .    here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are partial differentials relative to @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively . take a collapsing ideal fluid within a compact spherically symmetric spacetime region described by the following metric in the comoving coordinates @xmath21 : @xmath22 assuming the energy momentum tensor for the perfect fluid in the form @xmath23 with the weak energy condition @xmath24 where @xmath25 describes the equation of state .",
    "einstein equations give ,    [ gltbe2 ] =  ,  p_r=- , where @xmath26 , misner - sharp mass , is defined by    [ gltbe3 ] e^-2(r)^2-e^-2()^2=1- .",
    "we can define the matter flux into the apparent horizon matter flux relative to fluid 4-velocity [ flux ] d_t m=     using the einstein equation @xcite we get d_t m=4r_h^2 ( -u ) where @xmath27 . at first glance , we can see that the matter ( flux ) on the apparent becomes zero when density becomes zero on the apparent horizon .",
    "we define this quantity which characterize the slowly evolving horizon @xcite when ^2=_n^2r_h^2 1 .",
    "this quantity in the spherically symmetric space time becomes @xcite ^2= 4r_h^2 to have an slowly evolving black hole with mass @xmath28 the energy density for this black hole , @xmath29 , must be small . in the special case",
    "the @xmath30 we get the isolated horizon @xcite which the matter flux is zero .",
    "+ _ proposition : _ if a dynamical black hole evolves and finally its horizon becomes isolated , the space time geometry around the black hole horizon becomes schwarzschild metric with the same misner - sharp mass .",
    "+ if the horizon becomes isolated i.e. @xmath31 then the energy density becomes zero , @xmath32 .",
    "hence we have underdensity ( vacuum ) around the black hole horizon . on the other hand we know that the vacuum solutions of the einstein equation around a spherically symmetric mass distribution have schwarzschild form ds^2=-(1-)dt^2 + ( 1-)^-1dr^2+r^2 d^2 .",
    "using the fact the @xmath28 is the apparent horizon for schwartzchild metric ( as boundary condition ) , we get @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , in the isolated horizon case the space time geometry around horizon becomes schwarzschild with the same misner - sharp mass .",
    "+ located in the cosmological background , the cbh collapsing part separates from the expanding part and the density between them decreases .",
    "this underdense region is usually called void in the cosmology . as a result ,",
    "the matter flux can not exist forever and after sometime it decreases @xcite . in this case as inferred above taking the black hole as a point mass is a good model .",
    "in the last section we inferred that since the matter and matter flux around the black hole decrease and the black hole mass is bigger than the total matter around it , the point mass black hole can be a good model for cbh . on the other side the cosmological constant is the best model to describe the cosmic acceleration which we called it dark energy in the matter sector .",
    "the de sitter metric is the einstein equation solution with the cosmological constant .",
    "since the dark energy is the main cosmological matter ( about 70 % ) and all other matter ( dark matter and baryonic matter ) located in the matter flux which have fall in the black hole and made a point mass black hole , then it is sufficient to find the point mass black hole in the cosmological de sitter background .",
    "one may think that the schwarzschild - de sitter is a good metric for the cbh , but schwarzschild - de sitter has been written in the static coordinate .",
    "consequently it is needed find the schwarzschild - de sitter metric in the cosmological coordinate to present the point mass cbh .",
    "+ since the standard cosmological metrics are written in the synchronous coordinate , we first have to transform the schwarzschild - de sitter to the synchronous coordinates .",

    "if we solve the einstein equation with cosmological constant and a point mass with charge we get the de sitter - reissner nordstrom solution . here",

    "<S> , we argue that most of the dynamical cosmological black holes can be modeled by point mass cosmological black holes . considering the de sitter background for the accelerating universe </S>",
    "<S> , we present the point mass cosmological background in the cosmological de sitter space time . </S>",
    "<S> our work also includes the point mass black holes which have charge and angular momentum . </S>",
