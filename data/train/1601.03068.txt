    "the data were reduced with calcos v2.21 and custom software specifically designed for faint hst / cos targets@xcite , improving upon previous results on lyc leakage obtained with the default calcos pipeline products@xcite .",
    "as our spectra were taken at cos detector lifetime position 3 , we did not employ pulse height filtering to preserve source flux in the presence of detector gain sag from previous usage of cos at the nearby cos lifetime position 1 .",
    "we used boxcar extraction in a narrow 25  pixel rectangular window that preserves spectrophotometry for compact sources ( fig .",
    "2 ) while minimising the background .",
    "the cos background is dominated by detector dark current , which was subtracted in post - processing using scaled dark exposures to account for gain sag in the cos aperture . specifically , we co - added dark exposures taken in similar orbital conditions within 3 months of the science observations , smoothed the dark current in the cos aperture with a 500-pixel running average to remove poisson fluctuations , and rescaled the smoothed dark current to the science observations using unilluminated regions of the detector .",

    ", we corrected the line fluxes relative to the h@xmath14 flux for two effects : ( 1 ) reddening adopting the extinction curve@xcite and ( 2 ) underlying hydrogen stellar absorption .",
    "both are obtained simultaneously by an iterative procedure@xcite .",
    "the quantity derived from the hydrogen balmer decrement , is the extinction coefficient @xmath60 , corresponding to the extinction at the h@xmath14 wavelength @xmath61 .",
    "using the @xmath62/@xmath29 fits@xcite , we approximate the ratio @xmath60/@xmath29 by the relation @xmath63 with an accuracy better than 0.1% in the range @xmath64 = @xmath29/@xmath30 = 2.0  4.0 .",
    "we note that @xmath60/@xmath29 is weakly dependent on @xmath64 , decreasing by @xmath2210% with @xmath64 increasing from 2 to 4 .",
    "the correction for reddening was done in two steps .",

    "is detected in the sdss spectrum of j0925@xmath21403 .",
    "this allows for a reliable oxygen abundance determination using the direct @xmath71-method .",

    "we adopt a two - zone photoionised hii region model : a high - ionisation zone with temperature @xmath71(oiii ) , where [ oiii ] lines originate , and a low - ionisation zone with temperature @xmath71(oii ) , where [ oii ] lines originate . for @xmath71(oii ) , we use a model relation between the electron temperatures @xmath71(oiii ) and @xmath71(oii)@xcite .",

    "we note that the weak [ sii ] @xmath56717 , 6731 emission lines , which are used for the electron number density determination , can not be measured because they are located in the noisy part of the j0925 + 1403 spectrum .",
    "therefore , we adopted the value @xmath72 = 100 @xmath73 , typical of extragalactic hii regions .      the luminosity , stellar mass and star - formation rate are important global galaxy characteristics . for the determination of the stellar mass ,",
    "we follow earlier approach for modelling dwarf galaxies@xcite .",
    "the method is based on fitting a series of model seds to the observed one and finding the best fit .",
    "the fit was performed for the sdss spectrum over the entire observed spectral range of 39009200  . as the sed is the sum of both stellar and ionised gas emission , its shape depends on the relative contribution of these two components . in j0925@xmath21403 , with a rest - frame h@xmath14 equivalent width ew@xmath55 = 177  , the ionised gas continuum is strong and should be subtracted before determining the stellar mass .",
    "we carried out a series of monte carlo simulations to reproduce the sed of j0925@xmath21403 . to derive the stellar sed",
    ", we use a grid of instantaneous burst seds in a wide range of ages from 0.0 myr to 15 gyr , calculated with _",
    "we adopted geneva stellar evolution tracks for nonrotating and rotating stars@xcite and padova stellar evolution tracks@xcite .",
    "various models of stellar atmospheres were used@xcite , and we adopt two different stellar initial mass functions@xcite . then the sed with any star - formation history can be obtained by integrating the instantaneous burst seds over time with a specified time - varying star - formation rate .",
    "the sed of the gaseous continuum was taken into account .",
    "it included hydrogen and helium free - bound , free - free , and two - photon emission@xcite .",
    "the star - formation history is approximated assuming a recent short burst with age @xmath74 @xmath22 10 myr , which accounts for the young stellar population , and a prior continuous star formation for the older stars during the time interval between @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 and zero age is now ) .",
    "the contribution of each stellar population to the sed was parameterized by the ratio @xmath78 = @xmath79/@xmath80 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are respectively the masses of the young and old stellar populations",
    ". then the total stellar mass is @xmath81= @xmath79 + @xmath80 .",
    "we calculated 10@xmath82 monte carlo models by randomly varying @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath78 , while other parameters , such as evolutionary tracks , stellar atmosphere models , initial mass function and metallicity are kept fixed .",
    "in all cases we used models with metallicities , which best match the metallicity of j0925@xmath21403 . we also calculate the equivalent width ew@xmath55 for each model .",
    "the best solution is required to fulfill two conditions .",
    "first , only models , in which the modelled equivalent width ew@xmath55 of the h@xmath14 emission line agrees with the observed value within 5 % , were selected .",
    "second , the best modelled sed among selected models for each set of fixed parameters was found from @xmath83 minimization of the deviation between the modelled and the observed continuum in five wavelength ranges , which are free of the emission lines and residuals of the night - sky lines .",
    "we found best solutions for 33 combinations of evolutionary tracks , stellar atmosphere models and initial mass functions to investigate the dependence of the lyc flux density on the input parameters .",
    "all these solutions provide almost equally good fits at rest - frame wavelengths greater 912  and small variations of lyc .",
    "the optical spectrum of j0925@xmath21403 with the overlaid sed of one out of the 33 best models is shown in extended data fig .",
    "here we adopted a salpeter imf@xcite , padova evolutionary tracks@xcite and a combination of stellar atmosphere models@xcite .",
    "the modelled sed in the uv range is shown in fig .",
    "4a by a dash - dotted line .",
    "we note that the amount of the flux decrease at the lyman break at a fixed starburst age depends on the adopted stellar evolution tracks , stellar atmosphere models , and initial mass function . in particular , the lyman break in models with non - rotating stars is stronger , than in models with rotating stars .",
    "however , we find from the sed fitting that the intrinsic flux density @xmath84(@xmath5912 ) of the lyc varies only by @xmath110 % in the various sets of models .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that to fit the observed ew@xmath55 , the starburst age in models with rotating stars should be greater than that in models with non - rotating stars@xcite . for young bursts with the age of 0  3 myr we obtained the approximate relation @xmath84(@xmath5912 ) @xmath1 @xmath84(h@xmath14)/12 , which may be used to estimate the intrinsic lyc flux density in galaxies with @xmath37 @xmath85 1 without modelling .",
    "we also note that this relation is not much changed if continuous star formation is adopted for the young stellar population instead of an instantaneous burst .",
    "this is due to the dominant contribution of the 0  3 myr stellar population to both the lyc and h@xmath14 fluxes , while the contribution of older stars is small .    to derive global characteristics , the observed fluxes were transformed to luminosities adopting the luminosity distance 1620 mpc@xcite and the cosmological parameters @xmath19=67.1 km s@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , @xmath86=0.682 , @xmath21=0.318@xcite .",
    "additionally , for the determination of the h@xmath14 luminosity @xmath87 and star formation rate ( sfr ) , the h@xmath14 flux density corrected for aperture effects using the relation 2.512@xmath88 , where @xmath52 and @xmath52(app ) are respectively the sdss @xmath52-band total magnitude and the magnitude within the round spectroscopic 3@xmath18 diameter aperture .",
    "the aperture correction for j0925@xmath21403 is 1.54 .",
    "the derived h@xmath14 luminosity ( extended data table 3 ) corresponds to a number of ionising photons @xmath38 = 4.94@xmath1010@xmath89 s@xmath13 , in good agreement with the @xmath38 obtained from the integration of the number of ionising photons in the modelled intrinsic spectrum ( it is only @xmath18% lower ) .",
    "the corresponding star - formation rate is derived using the standard kennicutt relation@xcite .",
    "the comparison of the modelled seds with the observed photometric and spectroscopic data in the entire uv and optical range allows to verify , which extinction curve is most applicable to j0925@xmath21403 .",
    "it is known that the extinction curve in the uv range for the small magellanic cloud with oxygen abundance 12+logo / h  @xmath1  8.1 is much steeper than the milky way extinction curve , and is characterised by @xmath64 @xmath1 2.7@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the extinction curve in the optical range is insensitive to variations of @xmath64 .",
    "the oxygen abundance of j0925@xmath21403 is lower , @xmath17.9 .",
    "therefore , we may expect the extinction curve in this galaxy to be characterized by an even lower @xmath64 .",
    "the observed uv and optical spectra are shown in extended data figure  3 by grey lines .",
    "their fluxes are consistent with the sdss and galex photometric fluxes shown by the black symbols . to fit these observational data we reddened the intrinsic modelled sed , keeping the same milky way extinction @xmath67 = 0.039 , @xmath66 = 3.1 , and the internal extinction @xmath68 = 0.175 , but varying @xmath70 = 3.1 ( dotted line ) , 2.7 ( dashed line ) and 2.4 ( solid line ) .",
    "the modelled seds were calculated with padova stellar evolution models@xcite , a combination of stellar atmosphere models@xcite and a salpeter initial mass function@xcite .",
    "it is seen that the seds reddened with @xmath70 = 3.1 and 2.7 do not fit the observed fluxes in the uv range .",
    "a higher extinction coefficient @xmath68 would be needed in the uv .",
    "this is difficult to understand in the framework of a model with an uniform dust distribution , characterised by a single value of the extinction . on the other hand ,",
    "a sed reddened by the same extinction @xmath68 = 0.175 , but with @xmath70 = 2.4 , nicely reproduces the observed fluxes .",
    "if we use different stellar atmosphere models for the sed modelling , we find somewhat larger @xmath70 in some cases , but not exceeding 2.7 .",
    "to compare with other studies , we also estimate the lyc escape fraction from the often - used equation@xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the flux densities at rest - frame wavelengths 900and 1500 , respectively , the subscripts `` int '' and `` obs '' denote mean intrinsic and observed flux densities , @xmath93 = 1.36 from our sed fits , @xmath94 = 5.79 , and @xmath95 = 1.58 mag is the internal extinction at 1500  ( fig .",
    "4a ) . from this",
    "we obtain the relative escape fraction @xmath96% , and the absolute @xmath97% . the latter value is lower than our above determination for two reasons .",

    "2 does not take into account the fact that the expected extinction at 900  is higher than at 1500 . and second",
