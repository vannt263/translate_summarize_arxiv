    "as shown in sec.iii , we have observed the interesting behavior of the aging dynamics . in this section",
    "we discuss the physical origin of the @xmath45 dependence of @xmath75 and @xmath44 observed in the present measurements .",
    "the dynamic dielectric constant , @xmath28 , is obtained by dividing the complex electric capacitance @xmath27 at the temperature @xmath50 by the geometrical capacitance @xmath29 evaluated at @xmath30=273 k.    the evaluation of @xmath36 in this paper is based on the assumption that the @xmath50 and @xmath45 dependence of @xmath37 can be neglected compared with that of the _ intrinsic _ dielectric constant .",

    "however , the @xmath45 dependence of @xmath37 can not be neglected for the following two reasons .",
    "firstly , it is well - known that the physical aging of polymers increases the density with aging time .",
    "this is called densification , which leads to the decrease in film thickness with increasing @xmath45 .",
    "this contraction should be commonly observed independent of film thickness .",
    "in addition to this , recent measurements done by miyazaki _",
    "et  al . _",
    "show that the film thickness of polystyrene ( ps ) thin films supported on si substrate decreases very slowly with time at an annealing temperature above @xmath9 when the initial thickness is less than 20 nm  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that there should be a very slow relaxation process of ps in _ thin film geometry_. if we take into account the above two processes for pmma thin films , it follows that the geometrical capacitance @xmath37 depends on the aging time @xmath45 and that the @xmath45 dependence of @xmath37 of ultra thin films can be different from that of bulk samples .",
    "the effect due to the @xmath45 dependence of @xmath37 is evaluated here . since @xmath165 ,",
    "the relative change in @xmath166 is given by @xmath167 where @xmath35 is assumed not to change with time , and the symbol @xmath168(@xmath169=@xmath166 , @xmath75 , @xmath24 ) is @xmath170 .",
    "the discussions in this paragraph can also be valid for @xmath44 and @xmath171 .",
    "if the sample goes towards an equilibrium state during the aging process at a temperature , the densification proceeds and the thermal fluctuations are suppressed .",
    "the former leads to the decrease in @xmath24 , while the latter leads to the decrease in @xmath75 . in this case",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that @xmath172 and @xmath173 has the same form with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "although the aging strength may be modified , we can evaluate the @xmath45 dependence of @xmath75 through that of @xmath166 . in thin film geometry , however",
    ", the @xmath45 dependence of @xmath75 obtained thus may be affected by a possible existence of the very slow relaxation process of the film thickness .    as shown in fig.1(b ) , we observed that @xmath174 _ increases _ with @xmath45 after decaying up to about 11 h during the aging at @xmath175k for pmma thin films with the initial thickness of 20 nm .",
    "this increase may be due to the existence of the very slow relaxation process of the thickness observed only in thin film geometry  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic time of this very slow relaxation process should be longer than that of the relaxation of the _ intrinsic _ @xmath75 ( @xmath44 ) and the contraction due to the physical aging .",
    "now let us try to estimate the effect of the existence of this very slow relaxation process on the present experimental results . comparing the results in fig.1(a ) and fig.1(b ) , we find that @xmath176 and @xmath177 for @xmath178h at @xmath175k .",
    "an analysis of @xmath172 in the present measurements shows that @xmath179 0.0009 for @xmath178h at @xmath175k .",
    "therefore , even if the increase in @xmath75 exists under some conditions , the effect of this increase on the dynamics of the intrinsic @xmath75 is less than 20% when @xmath45 is limited to @xmath180h .",
    "it should be noted here that this effect can only be observed for @xmath75 near @xmath9 and for ultrathin films ( @xmath181 nm ) . on the basis of this discussion",
    ", we believe that the observed dynamics of @xmath75 and @xmath44 in the present measurements can safely be regarded as those of the intrinsic dielectric constants for pmma thin films , except for some special conditions mentioned above .",
    "the discussions here are based on the existence of the very slow relaxation mode in pmma thin films . in order to check the validity of this assumption",
    ", we should measure the frequency spectrum of dynamics dielectric constant in the lower frequency region .      in the cr and tc modes , we observed the memory and rejuvenation effects .",
    "there are many common properties between polymer glasses and spin glasses . for spin glass systems ,",
    "the memory and rejuvenation effects have been discussed by two different models : one is a hierarchical model  @xcite and the other is a droplet model  @xcite .",
    "the hierarchical model is based on the mean - field picture originating from the sherrington - kirkpatrick model  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the spin glass ( sg ) phase is characterized with a multi valley structure of the free energy surface at a given temperature . at a temperature @xmath2 ,",
    "the system relaxes over the many valleys formed at that temperature . when the system is cooled from @xmath2 to @xmath182(@xmath16 ) , each valley of the free energy splits into new smaller subvalleys . if @xmath6 is large enough , the energy barriers separating the initial valleys are too high to go among different initial valleys within the period of @xmath17 at @xmath15",
    ". only relaxations within the initial valleys can be activated , and hence the occupation number of each initial valleys holds during the aging at @xmath15 . when the system is heated again from @xmath15 to @xmath2 , the small subvalleys merge back into their ancestors .",
    "therefore , the memory at the end of the first isothermal aging process at @xmath2 can be memorized and recalled at @xmath132 .",
    "the rejuvenation effects can also be explained in a similar way .    as for the droplet model ,",
    "the growth of sg ordered domain is taken into account . in a spin glass system , the growth rate of the domain",
    "is very slowed down because of the heterogeneous distribution of the frustration .",
    "furthermore , the memory and rejuvenation effects can be explained within the droplet theory using the _ temperature chaos concept _ , in which the spin configuration or the energy landscape can be changed globally even for any infinitesimal temperature change on a length scale larger than the _ overlap length_.    recent studies based on the droplet model produced more powerful scenarios such as the droplets - in - domain scenario  @xcite and the ghost domain scenario  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , disordered systems showing the memory effects have been classified into 2 categories as follows :    1 .",
    "the system showing strong rejuvenation effects and memory effects : the _ strong rejuvenation _ is due to the temperature chaos effect . the relaxation associated with the strong rejuvenation after the temperature shift from @xmath2 to @xmath3 is the same as that observed after the direct cooling to the aging temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the system showing no strong rejuvenation , but a transient relaxation and memory effects : in this case , the strength of the transient relaxation after the temperature shift by @xmath8 becomes stronger with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "the aging proceeds cumulatively even if the temperature is shifted .    in some systems",
    ", both properties can be observed depending on the temperature shift @xmath8 . for a sufficiently small @xmath8 the aging proceeds cumulatively . when @xmath8 becomes large , the aging is no longer cumulative but the noncumulative and strong rejuvenation is observed just after the temperature shift .",
    "polymeric systems have been so far classified into the type 2 ) .",
    "although the memory effects have been observed , it has been reported in the literature that no strong rejuvenation occurs after the temperature shift  @xcite .",
    "however , the present measurements show that , after the negative temperature shift from @xmath2 to @xmath3 by @xmath5k , the relaxation of @xmath44 due to the aging is reinitialized , @xmath183 , goes back to the value on the reference curve measured during the cooling process .",
    "the values of the @xmath44 , then , begin to decay at @xmath3 along the relaxation curve measured after the cooling directly to @xmath3 , as shown in fig.7 . from this results",
    ", we believe that there is a strong rejuvenation in the case of pmma for @xmath5k . furthermore",
    ", as @xmath8 decreases from @xmath146k to @xmath143k in fig.8 , the contributions of the aging at @xmath3 to that at @xmath2 decrease , and the effective time @xmath140 decreases to 0 with increasing @xmath6 in the negative temperature cycle .",
    "this experimental results imply that there is a crossover from the cumulative dynamics to the noncumulative ones as the value of @xmath6 increases . in order to check whether there is really the crossover from cumulative to noncumulative , @xmath183 , whether there is the temperature chaos effect in polymeric systems ,",
    "the ` twin - temperature shift ' experiments should be performed , which have been developed in spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "comparing polymeric systems with spin glasses , the characteristic time of the microscopic flip motion of dipoles or spins can be expected to be much larger in polymeric systems than in spin glasses .",
    "therefore , polymeric systems may be a model system for investigating the aging dynamics in the shorter time regime , since an experimental time window corresponds to shorter time scales in polymeric systems compared with atomic spin glasses .",
    "superspin glasses ( strongly interacting nanoparticle systems )  @xcite can also be regarded as a model system for the same purpose , because they have the longer microscopic flip time of a superspin than atomic spin glasses have .",
    "the polymeric systems may have a still longer microscopic flip time , and hence we expect that the polymeric systems can be better model systems .",
    "as for the thickness dependence of the aging phenomena , we could obtain several interesting results : 1 ) the relaxation strength due to the aging decreases with decreasing film thickness .",
    "2 ) the width of the dip in @xmath106 during the cooling process in the cr mode becomes smaller with decreasing film thickness .",
    "3 ) the effective time @xmath140 in the tc mode decays to zero more quickly in a thin film geometry with increasing @xmath6 in the negative @xmath8 region than in bulk systems .    as mentioned in sec.iv ,",
    "some of the above results relating to the thickness dependence may be explained by assuming that the fundamental microscopic flip time @xmath158 of dipoles becomes smaller with decreasing film thickness . as shown in fig.5 ,",
    "the width of the dip observed during the cooling process in the cr mode is @xmath184k for @xmath107 nm and @xmath185k for @xmath136 nm in the case of pmma films . in ( atomic ) spin glasses , where @xmath158 is much smaller than in polymer glasses , the width of the dip of @xmath75 in the cr mode is @xmath186k  @xcite , which is even smaller than the value for the thinnest film thickness .",
    "the width of the dip observed in the cr mode does not depend on the cooling rate for the range of cooling rate from 0.08k / min to 0.33k / min , although the depth of the dip strongly depends on the cooling rate  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the aging dynamics in thin films of pmma with @xmath48nm@xmath144514 nm through dielectric measurements .",
    "the results obtained in the present measurements are as follows .    1 .",
    "the relaxation of dielectric constants is observed during the aging process at an aging temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the relaxation strength decreases with decreasing @xmath1 and with decreasing film thickness . in the films of @xmath48 nm and 26 nm ,",
    "the increase in @xmath75 has been observed at @xmath187k , which may be due to the existence of the ultra slow relaxation process of the film thickness observed recently through the x - ray reflectivity measurements .",
    "2 .   in the cr mode ,",
    "the aging at @xmath1 by the way of cooling to room temperature can be memorized as the dip in @xmath106 curve around @xmath1 . during the subsequent heating process",
    "the memory can be recalled .",
    "the width of the dip in @xmath106 decreases with decreasing film thickness .",
    "3 .   in the tc mode with negative @xmath8 ,",
    "a strong rejuvenation effect of the difference between @xmath44 and @xmath121 has been observed just after the negative shift from @xmath2 to @xmath3 by @xmath5k . at the same time , a complete memory effect could also be observed when the temperature goes back from @xmath3 to @xmath2 .",
    "as @xmath6 decreases in the negative @xmath8 region in the tc mode , the contributions of the aging at @xmath3 to that at @xmath2 become larger @xmath183 , the effective time @xmath140 , which is a measure of the contribution , increases from 0 to @xmath17 . a continuous change in @xmath140 with @xmath8",

    "the dependence of @xmath140 on @xmath8 depends on the film thickness .    in this paper",
    ", we focused on the aging dynamics observed in dielectric constants .",
