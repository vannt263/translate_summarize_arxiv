    "using the optimal set of degrees of freedom ( dofs ) in computer simulations of soft matter guarantees efficiency , accuracy and avoids huge amounts of unnecessary detail , which might even obscure the underlying physics .",
    "this very idea is exploited in systematic coarse - graining efforts for modern computational materials science and biophysics problems  @xcite , where atomistic simulations are usually beyond the possibilities of current and near future computers . a similar philosophy of reducing the number of dofs is also employed by representing clusters of molecules with soft particles when simulating fluids on a mesoscopic scale using dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd)@xcite .",
    "however , in typical soft matter systems different time- and length - scales are intrinsically interconnected and a multiscale modeling approach is required to tackle such problems in the most efficient way@xcite .",
    "recently , we have proposed an adaptive resolution scheme ( adress ) that couples the atomistic and coarse - grained levels of detail@xcite . due to the reduction in dofs upon coarse - graining , which eliminates the fluctuating forces associated with those missing molecular dofs",
    ", the coarse - grained molecules typically move faster than the corresponding atomistically resolved ones@xcite .",
    "although the accelerated dynamics is advantageous in some cases it can turn out to be problematic if one is really interested in dynamics in situations where two levels of resolutions are used within one simulation , as in the case of adress . to overcome this problem one can couple different classes of dofs to the langevin thermostat with different friction constants@xcite .",
    "we have shown in the example of liquid water that the coarse - grained dynamics can be slowed down by increasing the effective friction in the coarse - grained system@xcite . however ,",
    "it is well known that the langevin thermostat does not reproduce the correct hydrodynamics , i.e. , the hydrodynamic interactions are unphysically screened . in order to correctly describe hydrodynamic interactions ,",
    "one has to resort to the dpd thermostat@xcite .    in the past years dpd",
    "has established itself as a useful thermostat for soft matter simulations .",
    "the dpd thermostat is known to have several good properties , i.e. , the thermostat satisfies newton s third law by construction and owing to mass , momentum and temperature conservation , hydrodynamics is also correctly reproduced @xcite . as it turns out , however , the dpd thermostat in its standard form is not capable of controlling liquid properties such as viscosity and diffusion constant@xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to extend the dpd equations in such a way that these quantities can be tuned by changing the parameters of the thermostat .",
    "we consider the most general version of dpd@xcite and exploit the terms , which are not used in the standard dpd approach , i.e. , the damping of the perpendicular components of the relative particle velocities .",
    "this allows us to tune the viscosity of the coarse - grained liquid to match that of the all - atom counterpart while conserving the virtues of the standard dpd thermostat .",
    "this should be very useful for both coarse - grained and adaptive resolution simulations of soft matter .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the standard and new dpd thermostats are presented .",
    "the simulation setup is described in sec .",
    "the results of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the lennard - jones fluid and liquid water are reported in sec .",
    "iv , followed by the conclusions in sec . v.",
    "newton s equations of motion are used in microcanonical nve md simulations and generate dynamics with constant energy . in order to run simulations in the canonical nvt ensemble",
    "the equations of motion have to be modified . in langevin dynamics two additional forces",
    "are introduced , a  damping and a  random force , whose ratio defines the temperature .",
    "the dpd equations of motion ( used by the dpd thermostat ) are then given by@xcite @xmath0 and @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the conservative force on the @xmath3th particle .",
    "the damping and random forces , can be split up in particle pair forces as @xmath4 @xmath5 where the dissipative force reads as@xcite @xmath6 and the random force is given by @xmath7 in these equations the relative velocity @xmath8 between the @xmath3th and @xmath9th particle was introduced , while @xmath10 denotes the unit vector of the interatomic axis @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the friction constant and @xmath13 the noise strength . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath16-dependent weight functions .",
    "these are connected by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( see eqn .  ) .",
    "the variable @xmath17 is symmetric in the particle indices ( @xmath18 ) and has the following first @xmath19 and second moment @xmath20 the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite reads as @xmath21 and @xmath22 the above dpd equations conserve the total momentum and reproduce correctly the hydrodynamics interactions in the system .",
    "however , previous studies @xcite have shown that the strength of the friction @xmath12 does not influence the viscosity in linear order . in order to be able to tune the value of the viscosity of the system while preserving all of the virtues of the standard dpd thermostat presented briefly above we introduce in the next subsection its extension named `` transverse dpd thermostat '' .",
    "we generalize eqn .   and eqn .   as @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the friction constant and the noise strength of the generalized thermostat , respectively ( see the text below )",
    "@xmath27 is a  projection operator @xmath28 which is symmetric in the particle indices ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the scalar noise ( see eqn .  ) is replaced by a  noise vector @xmath30 @xmath31 which is antisymmetric in the particle indices ( @xmath32 ) due to the symmetry of the projection operator and the antisymmetry of the pair force ( newton s third law ) .",
    "the corresponding fokker - planck operator @xmath33 is a sum of two parts : the deterministic part @xmath34 @xmath35 and the generalized dpd part @xmath36 @xmath37 \\\\ \\nonumber & & + \\frac{\\upsigma^2}{2}\\sum_{i , j } w^\\text{r}(r_{ij})^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_i}\\cdot \\left[\\overleftrightarrow{p}_{ij } \\left ( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_i}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_j } \\right ) \\right ] .",
    "\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equilibrium condition @xmath38 then yields the dissipation - fluctuation - theorem in the same form as given by eqn .   and eqn .",
    "for the case where we choose the projector along the interatomic axis between particle @xmath3 and @xmath9 @xmath39 we retain the standard dpd thermostat .",
    "alternatively , one can project on the plane perpendicular to the interatomic axis @xmath40 the space defined by the projector ( [ pdpd ] ) is orthogonal to the case of the standard dpd and introduces an extension of the dpd thermostat , i.e. , the transverse dpd thermostat .",
    "note that owing to this orthogonality the new thermostat can be used in combination with the standard one .",
    "this enables us to adjust at the same time two friction constants @xmath12 and @xmath41 for the standard and transverse dpd thermostats , respectively .",
    "galilei invariance remains valid by construction while hydrodynamics is conserved within our error bar@xcite .",
    "our basic assumption is that in contrast to the standard dpd the viscosity is very sensitive to the damping perpendicular to the interatomic axis .",
    "this damping mimics the shear of those dofs that were integrated out in the coarse - graining procedure . in a system with two particles the stochastic forces of the transverse dpd thermostat act in the same direction as the shear forces .",
    "the mean force acting on a particle in the sheared system with more than two particles is hence a sum of two contributions : a force coming from the transverse dpd thermostat and another one originating from the shearing of the probe .",
    "therefore , the shear viscosity in a simulation with the transverse dpd thermostat is always higher than with the standard one . in the green - kubo picture",
    "this additional viscosity arises from the projected velocity - velocity autocorrelation function , which is derived by the mori - zwanzig formalism @xcite .",
    "the exact derivation is beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere . here",
    ", we shall demonstrate this by the results of our numerical experiments presented in the results section .",
    "all simulations of the lennard - jones ( lj ) liquid and liquid water are performed using the espresso package @xcite .",
    "we use the repulsive weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) potential @xmath42 with the cutoff at @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 being the standard lj parameters of length and energy .",
    "we chose as the weight function ( see eqn .  ) for both thermostats a  step function @xmath46    the simulations are carried out with a  system consisting of 1000 , 2000 and 4000 lj particles at a temperature @xmath47 and density @xmath48 in a  cubic box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "all - atom water nvt simulations at ambient conditions are performed using the rigid tip3p water model@xcite .",
    "the electrostatics is described by the reaction field ( rf ) method , in which all molecules outside a spherical cavity of a molecular based cutoff radius @xmath49  are treated as a dielectric continuum with a dielectric constant @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "typically , all - atom water simulations are carried out using global thermostats , e.g. , berendsen@xcite , nos - hoover@xcite , nos - hoover chains@xcite thermostats , that dissipate the energy uniformly in the system .",
    "local thermostats , e.g. , langevin , dpd@xcite , andersen@xcite , lowe - andersen@xcite , nos - hoover - lowe - andersen@xcite thermostats , that dissipate energy on a spatially localized scale are usually used in coarse - grained simulations . here , in order to reproduce the hydrodynamics correctly we employed the dpd thermostat@xcite with the friction constant @xmath51 and cutoff radius @xmath52 .",
    "the constant @xmath12 is small compared to the intrinsic friction coefficient @xmath53 of the tip3p water system , i.e. , @xmath54 , so that the stochastic dynamics yields the correct dynamics@xcite . for the coarse - grained water simulations with the transverse dpd thermostat",
    "we have employed the single - site water model from ref.@xcite , which reproduces essential thermodynamics and structural properties , e.g. , the pressure , density , and radial distribution functions , of the all - atom rigid tip3p water model at standard conditions .",
    "other simulation details are the same as given in ref.@xcite .",
    "first , we checked in an equilibrium simulation the dependency of pressure and temperature on the strength of the friction .",
    "we set the reference temperature to @xmath55 and measured the instantaneous temperature defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the kinetic energy and the number of particles of the system , respectively . the relative deviation between the measured and reference temperature was smaller then @xmath59 for all strengths of friction and all combination of thermostats .",
    "the mean pressure at that temperature turned out to be @xmath60 , which is in a perfect agreement with the results of previous studies @xcite .",
    "next , we studied the dependency of the liquid transport properties , i.e. , the diffusion constant and shear viscosity , on the friction constants @xmath12 and @xmath41 for the standard and transverse dpd thermostats , respectively .",
    "the diffusion constant was computed from the particle displacements using the einstein relation @xmath61 a small influence on this constant from the standard dpd thermostat @xcite is expected , but a  considerable one from the new transverse dpd thermostat .",

    "only the strength of the friction parameter @xmath41 was varied while the friction for the standard one was held constant at the value @xmath63 .",
    "the errors were obtained by averaging over several runs and jackknife analysis@xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the diffusion constant @xmath64 is very sensitive on the friction @xmath41 for the transverse dpd thermostat . by changing @xmath41",
    "it is therefore possible to tune the diffusion constant .",
    "the viscosity was measured in nonequilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd ) simulation by shearing the system with a constant shear rate in the @xmath65-direction@xcite @xmath66 the viscosity can then be determined by the following simple formula @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mean force ( momentum transfer per time unit ) . the apparent shear viscosity @xmath69 measured in nemd simulation approaches the equilibrium viscosity with decreasing shear rate .",
    "we found nearly no dependency on the strength of the friction @xmath12 for the standard dpd thermostat , ( see also ref .",
    "in contrast the friction @xmath41 for the transverse dpd thermostat gives a  very sensitive means of controlling the viscosity ( see fig .",
    "[ nemd_visco ] ) . in the case of the combination of both thermostats the shear viscosity",
    "is mostly controlled by the transverse dpd thermostat . in the limit of a vanishing shear rate a value of @xmath70",
    "was extrapolated , which matches former results @xcite .",
    "this extrapolation has to be done due to short characteristic timescale of the lj system .",
    "additionally , we also checked that the equilibrium correlation of the pressure tensor is in accordance with the green - kubo picture : all ( non - auto ) off - diagonal - ( off-)diagonal elements are uncorrelated , ( 60 of 81 possible elements are zero ) .",
    "shear viscosity measured with the nemd algorithm for different thermostats ( 4000 lj particles ) and the different shear rates ( 0.1 and 0.01 shown ) , which then are extrapolated to vanishing shear rate .",
    "the errors are obtained by jackknife analysis @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for higher values of @xmath41 the apparent viscosity becomes increasingly dependent on the shear rate .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dynamics is controlled in this regime by the thermostat forces ( that are linear in @xmath41 ) and hence we end up measuring the `` viscosity of the thermostat '' .",
    "having shown that the new thermostat enables us to tune the diffusion constant and viscosity of a simple liquid we apply it to an important physical example , i.e. , liquid water at ambient conditions .",
    "we first check that the structural properties do not depend on the thermostat and also that we obtain consistency between the coarse - grained and atomistic simulations .",

    "we used @xmath77 for the transverse dpd thermostat ( @xmath72 ) to match the diffusion constant of the coarse - grained water model to the corresponding value @xmath78 obtained from the all - atom simulation with the standard dpd thermostat . with a friction strength of @xmath79 , which is as desired very close to the above value for matching the diffusion constants",
    ", we were also able to match the viscosity to the desired value @xmath80 for the tip3p water model ( from our atomistic simulation with @xmath51 ) . in this case",
    "the characteristic times for the atomistic model are much longer than the time scale of the shearing ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "therefore even with a shear rate of @xmath82 we are in the no shear limit and hence no extrapolation is required .",

    "in this paper we introduced an extension of the dpd thermostat that allows for controlling the transport properties of molecular liquids , e.g. , water , while preserving the hydrodynamics .",
    "the presented galilean invariant local thermostat can be used in coarse - grained simulations to tune the diffusion constant and viscosity of the system to the desired values .",
    "this opens up the possibility of reproducing the atomistic dynamics by coarse - grained simulations , as it is required , for example , in recently introduced adaptive resolution simulations .",
    "note that due to the transverse dpd thermostat forces between molecules are not central and therefore the local angular momentum is not conserved .",
