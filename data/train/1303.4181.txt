    "the existence and uniqueness of a self - interacting measure - valued diffusion that is either attracted to or repelled from its centre of mass is shown below .",
    "it is natural to consider a super ornstein  uhlenbeck ( sou ) process with attractor ( repeller ) given by the centre of mass of the process as it is the simplest diffusion of this sort .",
    "this type of model first appeared in a recent paper of engl \" ander @xcite where a @xmath0-dimensional binary brownian motion , with each parent giving birth to exactly two offspring and branching occurring at integral times , is used to construct a binary branching ornstein  uhlenbeck process where each particle is attracted ( repelled ) by the center of mass ( com ) .",
    "this is done by solving the appropriate sde along each branch of the particle system and then stitching these solutions together .",
    "this model can be generalized such that the underlying process is a branching brownian motion ( bbm ) , @xmath1 ( i.e. , with a general offspring distribution ) .",
    "we might then solve an sde on each branch of @xmath1 : @xmath2 for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 labels the @xmath5th particle of @xmath1 alive from time @xmath6 to @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the parent of @xmath5 and @xmath9 is the center of mass . here , @xmath10 is the population of particles alive from time @xmath6 to  @xmath7 .",
    "this constructs a branching ou system with attraction to the com when @xmath11 and repulsion when @xmath12 .",
    "it seems reasonable then , to take a scaling limit of branching particle systems of this form and expect it to converge in distribution to a measure - valued process where the representative particles behave like an ou process attracting to ( repelling from ) the com of the process .",
    "though viable , this approach will be avoided in lieu of a second method utilizing the historical stochastic calculus of perkins @xcite which is more convenient for both constructing the sou interacting with its com and for proving various properties .",
    "the idea is to use a supercritical historical brownian motion to construct the interactive sou process by solving a certain stochastic equation .",
    "this approach for constructing interacting measure - valued diffusions was pioneered in @xcite and utilized in , for example ,  @xcite .    a supercritical historical brownian motion , @xmath13 ,",
    "is a stochastic process taking values in the space of measures over the space of paths in @xmath14",
    ". one can think of  @xmath13 as a supercritical superprocess which has a path - valued brownian motion as the underlying process . that is , if @xmath15 is a @xmath0-dimensional brownian motion , then @xmath16 is the underlying process of @xmath13 .",
    "more information about @xmath13 is provided in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "it can be shown that if a path @xmath17 is chosen according to @xmath18 ( loosely speaking  this is made rigorous below in definition  [ dcamp ] ) , then @xmath19 is a brownian motion stopped at @xmath20 .",
    "projecting down gives @xmath21 which is a ( supercritical ) super brownian motion .",
    "a key advantage to projecting down and constructing measure - valued processes is that it is possible to use the historical stochastic calculus to couple different projections together ( and hence couple measure - valued diffusions ) .",
    "one can sensibly define the ornstein  uhlenbeck sde driven by @xmath22 according to  @xmath18 as the solution of a stochastic equation .",
    "let @xmath23 be borel measurable .",
    "we say that @xmath24 is a solution to the strong equation  [ se1 ] if the pair satisfies    @xmath25 \\\\[-10pt ] \\nonumber & & \\mbox{(b)}\\quad    x_t(a ) = \\int1(z_t\\in a)k_t(dy)\\qquad \\forall a\\in\\b(\\r ^d)\\ \\forall t\\ge0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are appropriately adapted .",
    "we will henceforth call the projection  @xmath26 the ordinary super ornstein  uhlenbeck process .    if @xmath11 , @xmath28 is attracted to the origin , and if @xmath12 it is repelled .",
    "the approximate meaning of @xmath13-a.e . in ( a )",
    "is that the statement holds for  @xmath18-a.a .",
    "@xmath22 , for all  @xmath18 , @xmath29-a.s .",
    "the exact definition is given in the next section .",
    "the projection @xmath30 is a sou process with attraction to ( repulsion from ) the origin at rate @xmath31 .",
    "intuitively , @xmath13 tracks the underlying branching structure and @xmath28 is a function transforming a typical brownian path into a typical ornstein  uhlenbeck path .",
    "note that in the definitions of  [ se1 ] and  [ se2 ] given below , part ( b ) is unnecessary to solve the equations .",
    "it has been included to provide an easy comparison to the strong equation of chapter v.1 of  @xcite .",
    "for all the results mentioned in the remainder of this work , the standing assumption ( unless indicated otherwise ) will be that @xmath32    [ tsourep ] there is a pathwise unique solution @xmath24 to  [ se1 ] .",
    "that is , @xmath26 is unique @xmath29-a.s . and @xmath27 @xmath13-a.e .",
    "furthermore , the map @xmath33 is continuous and @xmath26 is a @xmath34-super - critical super ornstein  uhlenbeck process .",
    "similar to the above , we establish a function of the path @xmath22 that is a path of an ou process with attraction ( repulsion ) to the com and project down .",
    "let @xmath35 be borel measurable .",
    "define ( @xmath36 ) as the solution of    @xmath37 \\\\[-10pt ] \\nonumber & & \\textup{(b ) } \\quad   x'_t(a ) = \\int1(y_t\\in a)k_t(dy)\\qquad \\forall a\\in\\b(\\r ^d)\\ \\forall t\\ge0 , \\ ] ]    where the com is @xmath38 we will call the projection @xmath39 the super ornstein  uhlenbeck process with attraction ( repulsion ) to its com , or the interacting super ornstein  uhlenbeck process .    note that by our definitions of @xmath26 and @xmath39 as solutions to @xmath40 , respectively , that ( [ efinmass ] ) is the same as saying that @xmath41 as these quantities equal that in ( [ efinmass ] ) .    [ texuniq ] there is a pathwise unique solution to  [ se2 ] .    one could prove this theorem using a combination of the proof of theorem  [ tsourep ] and a localization argument .",
    "we find it more profitable however , to employ a correspondence with the ordinary sou process @xmath26 .",
    "this correspondence plays a central role in the analysis of @xmath39 , and indeed reveals a very interesting structure : we have that for any @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the com of @xmath26 , defined as @xmath45 the correspondence essentially says that the sou process with attraction ( repulsion ) to its com is the same as the ordinary sou process being dynamically pushed by its com . from this equation ,",

    "show first that the time integral in ( [ ecoupl ] ) converges in some sense and establish limiting behavior for @xmath51 .",
    "one then hopes to combine these two facts with  ( [ ecoupl ] ) to get the desired result .",
    "let @xmath52 be the event that @xmath18 survives indefinitely .",
    "note that this implies that on @xmath52 , both @xmath26 and @xmath39 survive indefinitely by their definitions as solutions of the equations above .",

    "[ tsurvival ] on @xmath52 the following hold :    if @xmath65 @xmath66 and this integral is finite almost surely .    if @xmath67 , then @xmath68 and this quantity converges almost surely .",
    "this says that the coms of ordinary and interacting sou process converge and is the result that allows us to fruitfully use the correspondence of ( [ ecoupl ] ) to show convergence of the interacting sou process .",
    "the next theorem shows that the mass normalized sou process converges almost surely , which is a new result among superprocesses .",
    "englnder and winter in  @xcite have shown that this process converges in probability , and before them , englnder and turaev in  @xcite shown convergence in distribution .",
    "one expects a result of this sort to hold since in the particle picture conditional on survival , at large time horizons , there are a very large number of particles that move as independent ou processes , each of which are located in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "thus , we expect that in the limit the mass will be distributed according to the limiting distribution of an ou process .",
    "[ tsouconv ] suppose @xmath11 .",

    "it is possible to show that theorem  [ tsouconv ] holds for a more general class of superprocesses .",
    "if the underlying process has an exponential rate of convergence to a stationary distribution , then the above theorem goes through .",
    "one can appeal to , for example , theorem 4.2 of tweedie and roberts  @xcite for a class of such continuous time processes .    using the correspondence of ( [ ecoupl ] )",

    "when there is repulsion , matters become more difficult on the survival set .",
    "it is no longer clear whether there exists a limiting random measure , or what the correct normalizing factor is .",
    "we can show however that in some cases the com of the interacting sou process still converges . that there should be a limiting measure comes from the fact that the ordinary repelling sou process has been shown to converge in probability by englnder and winter in  @xcite to a multiple of lebesgue measure .",
    "one may expect something similar to hold for the interacting sou process , given ( [ ecoupl ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the correspondence is rendered ineffectual in this case by part ( b ) of the following theorem .",
    "[ trcom ] the following hold on @xmath52 if @xmath77 :    the process , @xmath55 converges almost surely .",
    "however , @xmath56 diverges exponentially fast .",
    "that is , there is a random variable  @xmath78 , such that @xmath79    this reveals an interesting byplay between @xmath26 and @xmath39 in the repelling case .",
    "that is , if one fixes a compact set @xmath80 , then for the ordinary sou process , @xmath30 , @xmath81 is exponentially distant from the com of the process .",

    "therefore , one might expect that @xmath81 is charged by a different amount of mass by @xmath82 than @xmath30 , and thus we might need to renormalize @xmath82 differently to get a valid limit .",
