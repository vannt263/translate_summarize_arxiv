    "there is a common belief in the field of statistical mechanics that the qualitative properties of the systems living on cayley trees @xmath0 and on the ( tesselations @xmath1 of the ) lobachevsky plane @xmath2 should be the same .",
    "indeed , the behavior of the ratio @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the volume of the ball @xmath5 of radius @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the volume of the sphere @xmath8 of the same radius , is the same for the two families of graphs , as @xmath9 . yet",
    "the models on the cayley trees are studied in much more details , due to the fact that there one can use the recurrent relations , which were used in many papers , like @xcite or @xcite . on the lobachevsky plane no such relations exists , since the graphs @xmath1 have cycles .",
    "in fact , the cayley trees @xmath0 are ` limits ' of the tesselations @xmath10 when @xmath11 see fig.1 . nevertheless , some results for the cayley trees were also obtained for the lobachevsky plane as well  see @xcite , for example .",
    "one such result is about the non translation invariant states of the ising model on the cayley trees and lobachevsky plane . for the cayley trees",
    "the analogs of dobrushin non translation invariant states @xmath12 @xcite , where an interface separates @xmath13-phase from the @xmath14-phase , were constructed by blekher and ganikhodzhaev in @xcite . for the lobachevsky plane",
    "these were obtained by series and sinai , @xcite .     and the cayley tree @xmath15.,width=529 ]",
    "later it was discovered that there are much more non translation invariant states on cayley trees @xmath0 than there are those for the case of the lattice @xmath16 namely , in @xcite the authors constructed gibbs states of the ferromagnetic ising model on @xmath0 , @xmath17 which they called ` weakly periodic ' .",
    "for such a state @xmath18 the expectation @xmath19 of the spin @xmath20 at @xmath21 is a ` periodic ' function on @xmath22 taking finitely many different values .",
    "thus , it is different both from the @xmath13-state @xmath23 and the @xmath14-state @xmath24 , as well as from the dobrushin @xmath25 states . indeed , for every @xmath26 we have @xmath27 @xmath28 while the function @xmath29 takes infinitely many values ",
    "provided the temperature @xmath30 is low enough . here",
    "@xmath31 is the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "then in @xcite we have given a general construction of a grand family of pure states on cayley trees @xmath22 again for @xmath32 one can think of these states as having infinitely many rigid @xmath33-interfaces , and moreover the density of those interfaces is positive .",
    "( the reader should not think that the trees @xmath0 with @xmath34 have properties which the lighter trees @xmath15 and @xmath35 do not enjoy .",
    "indeed , in the section 4 of the present paper we explain how to modify the constructions of @xcite in order to include all the cayley trees @xmath0 , @xmath36 so the trees @xmath0 with @xmath34 are not special in that respect . )",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to construct similar family of states on the tesselations @xmath1 of the lobachevsky plane @xmath37 here @xmath1 is the planar graph , such that each face has @xmath38 edges , every vertex is incident to @xmath39 edges , and @xmath40 .",
    "every such graph can be isometrically embedded into @xmath37 the main result of the present paper is the construction of gibbs states of the ising model on @xmath41 which have infinitely many dobrushin @xmath33-interfaces . in our case",
    "the interfaces are 1d random curves .",
    "they are rigid , as is the interface of the dobrushin state @xmath42 of the ising model on @xmath43 but unlike the 3d lattice , when there can be at most one such interface , on the lobachevsky plane @xmath2 one can have infinitely many of them .",
    "moreover , they can have positive density .",
    "we call these states the * foliated states * , or just the millefeuilles .    in the next section",
    "we introduce special families of geodesics , which we call geodesical families .",
    "we provide examples of such families and establish their properties .",
    "the geodesical families define foliated * * ground state configurations .",
    "we prove in the section 3 that these ground state configurations are stable : the thermal fluctuations do not destroy them . in other words , there are low - temperature gibbs states , which are small perturbations of the foliated * * ground states . in the section 4 we study the foliated states on the cayley trees .",
    "let @xmath44 be a locally compact riemannian manifold .",
    "a ( finite or countable ) family @xmath45 of smooth curves @xmath46 either closed or coming from and going to infinity , will be called a * geodesical family * , if no bounded surgery can decrease its length . by this",
    "we mean the following : let @xmath47 \\subset\\gamma_{i},i=1, ... ,k\\right\\ }   $ ] be a collection of segments of the curves @xmath48 @xmath49 we want to remove the segments @xmath50 and to interconnect the remaining family of curves , @xmath51 in a different way . to do this ,",

    "the family @xmath58 is called geodesical , if for any @xmath59 any collection @xmath60 and permutation @xmath52 and any collection @xmath61 the increment @xmath62 is strictly positive . in particular , each curve",
