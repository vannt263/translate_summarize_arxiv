    "we compare the isoscalar nucleon data , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xf3 ] ( left panel ) . as before ,",
    "the lower and upper curves in the second resonance region correspond to the `` slow '' and `` fast '' fall - offs of the axial form factors , respectively .    to quantify the degree to which the resonance and deep inelastic structure functions are dual , we calculate the ratio of integrals for the @xmath154 structure function as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) .",
    "this ratio , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xf3 ] ( right panel ) , appears to fall off more rapidly with @xmath7 than for the @xmath146 ratio , and reaches @xmath155 at @xmath156 .",
    "the @xmath93 structure function is in general more sensitive to the choice of axial form factors , and our results are consistent with the uncertainty in the axial form factors , which is estimated to be @xmath157 at @xmath156 .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : f12x - nun - na ] ( left panel ) we show the neutrino structure function @xmath158 as a function of @xmath101 for several @xmath7 values .",

    "[ fig : f12x - nun - na ] ( right panel ) , is about 20% above 1 for @xmath160  gev@xmath11 , which again may be an indication that target mass effects need to be removed from the leading twist structure function before comparing with the resonance contributions .",
    "one of the most fundamental results in neutrino scattering is the relation between the difference of the @xmath129 and @xmath133 structure functions for quasi - elastic ( qe ) scattering and for the rest of the higher mass states @xcite , @xmath161 ^ 2 + \\left [ g_{1a}^{(qe)}(q^2 ) \\right]^2 + \\left [ g_{2v}^{(qe)}(q^2 ) \\right]^2",

    "\\label{eq : adlersr}\\ ] ] because it measures the isospin of the target , this relation must hold for all values of @xmath7 .    in the @xmath162 limit , eq .",
    "( [ eq : adlersr ] ) is reduced to the adler - weisberger relation @xcite , which has been verified experimentally to good accuracy . for @xmath163 , it is known as the adler sum rule @xcite , which has also been tested with data for neutrino deep inelastic scattering , and found to hold to @xmath164 accuracy @xcite . at large @xmath7 it has a simple interpretation in the parton model , in terms of integrals of valence quark distributions . using the model @xcite for the resonance form factors ,",
    "we can study how the adler sum rule is satisfied as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "for the qe form factors we use the following simple parametrization : @xmath165 the @xmath166 structure functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adlersr ] ) include contributions from resonance production and from the deep inelastic region .",
    "the resonance contribution is calculated for the first four resonances , as discussed earlier .",
    "the integration is performed in the range of @xmath167 corresponding to the final state mass range @xmath168 . in terms of @xmath101 ,",
    "the integration of the structure function for each @xmath7 corresponds to the area under the resonance curve from @xmath169 to @xmath170 .",
    "the contribution from the remaining @xmath101 interval , @xmath171 , corresponds to the higher @xmath132 region .",
    "for this we assume that the structure functions are given by the leading twist contributions , calculated from the mrst parametrization @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : adlersr ] the individual contributions from the qe , resonance , and dis regions are plotted as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "the ( positive ) qe contribution is large at low @xmath7 but falls rapidly with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the resonant piece of the sum is negative , and partially cancels the qe component .",
    "the deep inelastic component grows with @xmath7 , since @xmath172 as @xmath84 , and for @xmath173 contributes some 80% of the integral . combining the three terms",
    ", the sum rule is found to be satisfied within @xmath174 over the whole range @xmath175 .",
    "since the adler some rule is based on very general grounds , one expects it to be exact .",
    "the 10% deviation of the calculated sum rule from the exact value should therefore be treated as an indication of the accuracy of the model . in practice",
    ", the uncertainty comes mainly from the axial form factors for the second resonance region , and suggests that some of them are underestimated .",
    "the requirement that the adler sum rule is satisfied exactly could therefore serve as a restriction on the currently unknown axial form factors .",
    "motivated by the need to understand neutrino ",
    "nucleon cross sections in the @xmath88  few gev@xmath11 range , and the observation of quark - hadron duality in electron  nucleon scattering , we have performed a detailed phenomenological study of duality in neutrino structure functions . using a recently developed model @xcite for the first four lowest - lying nucleon resonances , we have computed the structure functions @xmath1 , @xmath89 and @xmath97 in the resonance region for proton and neutron targets , and compared these with leading twist parameterizations .    as a check of the resonance model",
    ", we have calculated the electron ",
    "nucleon structure functions and found that for each resonance these oscillate around the leading twist curves down to low values of @xmath7 , in qualitative agreement with duality .",
    "for quantitative comparisons , we defined ratios @xmath109 of resonance to leading twist structure functions , which in the ideal case of duality , should be unity .",
    "our results show that for the @xmath102 structure function this ratio is below unity at low @xmath7 , and slowly grows with @xmath7 , consistent with recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "the agreement with duality for @xmath3 in this case is at the level of 20% . at low @xmath7",
    "the resonance averaged @xmath1 structure function resembles valence quark distributions , apparently oblivious to sea quark effects , which supports the hypothesis of two  component duality @xcite . for the @xmath116 structure function",
    "the ratio is about 40% above unity , but would be reduced after correcting for target mass effects in the leading twist structure function .    for charged current neutrino scattering , duality does not hold for proton and neutron targets separately because of the dominant role played by the isospin-3/2 resonances .",
    "however , averaging over proton and neutron targets leads to large cancellations between @xmath176 and @xmath62 resonances , so that duality holds at the 20% level for isoscalar @xmath123 structure functions .",
    "furthermore , the ratios @xmath177 and @xmath178 appear to reach constant values already for @xmath179 .",
    "another interesting feature of our analysis is that the ratios @xmath180 and @xmath181 of the @xmath116 structure functions are consistently above unity .",
    "this may be an indication of the importance of target mass corrections in the leading twist @xmath0 structure functions , which are known to be more important than those in @xmath1 .    in these comparisons",
    "we have used leading twist structure functions obtained from global parton distributions , which are well constrained by experimental data , especially for @xmath1 . for the resonances , on the other hand , the data are very sparse , and theoretical input needs to be used .",
    "our results therefore have an inherent uncertainty arising from poor knowledge of the transition form factors , particularly at high @xmath7 .",
    "the results obtained here raise the following question : what is the most efficient and quantitative method for comparing the resonance contributions with the scaling curves and their qcd corrections ?",
    "one approach is to compare the various contributions to sum rules , in which integrals over resonance and dis contributions must reproduce physical constants . to this end",
    "we computed the various contributions to the adler sum rule as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "this exercise shows how the relative contributions vary with @xmath7 , and saturate @xmath182 of the sum rule .",
    "the remaining 10% could be accounted for by including more resonances , and by better determining the transition form factors .",
    "overall , our quantitative study of neutrino reactions indicates that duality in structure functions , averaged over protons and neutrons , is expected to work to even better accuracy for neutrino scattering than for electron scattering .",
