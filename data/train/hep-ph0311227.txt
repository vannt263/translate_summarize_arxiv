    "ever since the discovery that quark and gluons in bound nucleons show momentum distributions noticeably different to those measured in free or less bound nucleons @xcite , two decades ago , the precise determination of nuclear parton densities has awakened growing attention , driving both increasingly precise and comprehensive nuclear structure functions measurements @xcite , and more refined theoretical understanding of the underlying physics .",
    "the precise knowledge of nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdf ) is not only required for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms associated to nuclear binding from a qcd improved parton model perspective , but it is also the starting point for the analyses of a wide variety of future and ongoing high energy physics experiments , such as heavy ion collisions at rhic @xcite , proton - nucleus collisions to be performed at lhc @xcite , or neutrino - nucleus interactions in long baseline neutrino experiments @xcite , for example .",
    "consequently , the accuracy of npdf is rapidly evolving into a key issue in many areas of particle physics .    from the point of view of perturbative qcd",
    ", the extraction of npdf can be done in close analogy to what is done for free nucleons : they are considered as non perturbative inputs , to be inferred from data , whose relation to the measured observables and energy scale dependence are computed order by order in perturbation theory . although one can not discard larger higher twist power corrections than in the case of free nucleons , or even some sort of nuclear recombination effect , factorization and universality of npdf are expected to hold in a very good approximation , over a wide kinematical range in the present experiments .    at variance with nucleon pdf , which driven by the demand of more and more precise predictions , have attained in the last years an impressive degree of accuracy and refinement ,",
    "npdf extractions are in a considerably earlier stage of the development .",
    "not only the number and diversity of nuclear data is much more reduced , but the analyses are restricted to leading order accuracy ( lo ) , with rather crude parameterizations of nuclear effects which lead to poor @xmath0 values in global qcd fits to data @xcite .",
    "there are also some caveats inherent to the particular approaches implemented so far , that define npdf in terms of nucleon pdf and a multiplicative nuclear correction factor at a given initial energy scale , from where they are evolved . in the first place , npdf defined in this way have their momentum fraction per nucleon restricted to be less or equal than unity , what excludes from the description , and also from the evolution , a portion of its natural kinematical range . of course",
    ", unless one is specifically interested in that region , this approximation is expected to imply a minor correction , although one can not discard the excluded region as a source of new and interesting information .",
    "much more problematic in these approaches is that the actual shape of the nuclear correction factor required to reproduce accurately the data implies very capricious functions , with a large number of parameters , and which in practice precludes the numerical computation of the scale dependence at next to leading order accuracy ( nlo ) .",
    "the actual computation of structure functions and evolution equations at this order implies several convolution integrals very difficult to evaluate unless mellin transform techniques are applied .    in this paper",
    "we show that a much more convenient alternative to deal with nuclear effects is to define npdf using a convolution approach . in such framework",
    "the free nucleon parton densities are convoluted with very simple weight functions that parameterize nuclear effects .",
    "the convolution method naturally takes into account the actual range of nucleon momentum fractions , allows via mellin transform techniques a straightforward numerical evaluation of the nlo scale dependence , lead to extraordinarily accurate npdf with relatively few parameters , and finally , allow to interpret the nuclear modifications in terms of a very simple mechanism of rebalance of momentum fractions between the distributions .",
    "the success of the convolution approach comes from the fact that the momentum fraction dependence of nuclear effects is strongly correlated to that of partons in free nucleons , as shown in re - scaling models @xcite , feature which is explicitly included by the convolution .    as an example of feasibility of the convolution approach we obtain for the first time a full nlo extraction of npdf from a large number of nuclear dis @xcite and drell yan data @xcite .",
    "we also asses the differences between the lo and nlo extractions , finding that although the quality of fits to present data is comparable in both approximations , there are important differences between the @xmath1 dependence of the nuclear correction factors using either lo or nlo extractions .",
    "this , for example , questions the use of lo factors with nlo nucleon parton densities to generate npdf in nlo computations , as it is common practice .    in the following section we summarize the main motivation and features of the convolution approach . in the third section we present the details and outcome of the nlo and lo npdf extractions ,",
    "comparing our results with previous lo analyses .",
    "in the last section we discuss the differences between lo and nlo extractions of npdf , computing the one hadron production cross section with them as and example , and present our conclusions .",
    "the description of dis processes off nuclear targets , @xmath2 , is customarily done in terms of the hard scale @xmath1 , defined as minus the virtuality of the exchanged photon , and a scaling variable @xmath3 , analogue to the bjorken variable used in dis off nucleons , @xmath4 respectively . here",
    "@xmath5 is the target nucleus momentum and consequently , @xmath3 is kinematically restricted to @xmath6 , just as the standard bjorken variable .",
    "alternatively , one can define another scaling variable @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mass number of the nucleus . under the assumption that the nucleus momentum @xmath5 is evenly distributed between that of the constituent nucleons @xmath9 , this variable resembles the bjorken variable corresponding to the scattering off free nucleons , @xmath10 .",
    "however in nuclear scattering context of course it spans the interval @xmath11 , by definition , and reflecting the fact that a parton may in principle carry more than the average nucleon momentum .    when discussing npdf the usual approach is to propose a very simple relation between the parton distribution of a _ proton _ bound in the nucleus , @xmath12 , and those for free protons @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 in terms of a multiplicative nuclear correction factor @xmath15 , specific for a given nucleus @xmath16 , parton flavor @xmath17 , and initial energy scale @xmath18 .",
    "this description is convenient since the ratio @xmath15 compares directly the parton densities with and without nuclear effects , and is closely related to the most usual nuclear dis observables , which are the ratios between the nuclear and deuterium structure functions .",
    "indeed , we will use this picture to simplify the presentation of the output of our analysis .",
    "however , this is not the best suited way to parameterize the effects in the intermediate steps of the analysis , nor the best alternative for higher order numerical computations , as it was mentioned previously .    since @xmath19 are defined for @xmath20 , npdf defined as in eq.([eq : f1 ] ) are a priori restricted to that same range at the initial scale . in most analyses",
    "the evolution equations are also constrained to @xmath20 , loosing the possibility of analyzing nuclear effects beyond @xmath21 at any other scale .",
    "notice that even if npdf were constrained to be zero for @xmath21 at a given scale , the complete evolution equations would produce non - zero values for other scales in the range of @xmath22 neglected by the approach , leading to a possible violation of momentum conservation .",
    "from another side , the direct parameterization of the ratios @xmath15 require many parameters and even @xmath22-dependencies whose mellin moments can not be put into a closed expression .    a much more adequate alternative to eq.([eq : f1 ] )",
    "is to relate npdf to standard pdf by means of a convolution @xmath23 where the weight function @xmath24 parameterize now the nuclear effects and can be thought as the effective density of nucleons within the nucleus carrying a fraction @xmath25 of its longitudinal momentum . besides allowing the full kinematical range for npdf",
    ", this kind of approach has been shown to lead to remarkably good parameterizations of nuclear effects with very few parameters , and with a smooth @xmath8-dependence @xcite .",
    "for example , neglecting nuclear effects , the effective nucleon density is just @xmath26 , and simple shifts in the momentum fraction carried by nucleons @xmath27 have been shown to reproduce in a very good approximation many features of the known nuclear modifications to structure functions .",
    "the convolution approach also allows to perform the evolution in mellin space , which is much more convenient numerically , and almost mandatory for nlo accuracy . defining @xmath28 eq.([eq : f2 ] ) reads @xmath29 and in mellin space , i.e. taking moments in both sides of eq.([eq : f3 ] ) , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and similarly for @xmath32 with @xmath33 , and @xmath34 notice that the moments are defined in terms of the correct scaling variable @xmath3 , and that the evolution of the npdf moments @xmath35 can be managed with a standard evolution code in mellin space .",
    "nuclear structure functions are defined as the average of the proper combination of the bound proton and neutron structure functions as @xmath36 where both bound nucleon structure functions can be written in terms of the corresponding nuclear parton distributions in mellin space as @xmath37 \\right\\ }   \\nn \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in the right hand side of eq.([eq : ff2 ] ) corresponds to the leading - order contribution while the second represents the next - to - leading order correction .",
    "expressions for the nlo quark and gluon coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be found in @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we consider only 3 active flavors and neglect the contribution from heavy quarks to the structure function .",
    "considering that dis data does not allow to determine all combinations of flavors , and that nuclear effects may be expected to be isospin invariant in a first approximation , it seems to be reasonable to introduce only three independent @xmath24 : one for the valence distributions , another for the light sea , and the last for the gluons . in this way @xmath40 notice that in many proton parton densities , and in particular in grv98 @xcite , the one will be used in the following , the strange and heavy quark densities vanish at the low initial scale and there is no need to introduce additional weight functions for the latter .",
    "the parton distributions for the bound neutron can be obtained from the ones above by isospin symmetry .    an interesting feature in this approach",
    "is that since non - singlet combinations of parton densities , as those for valence quarks , evolve independently , and both @xmath41 and @xmath42 obey the same evolution equations , the moments of the weight function @xmath43 are scale independent . defined in @xmath44space as in eq.([eq : f1 ] ) ] this is not the case for sea or gluon weight functions , since they are affected by singlet evolution resulting in a scale dependence due to quark and gluon mixing and therefore needed to be defined at a particular scale .",
    "charge , baryon number and momentum conservation imply constraints to be satisfied by the weight functions : @xmath45    the best results are obtained using for the valence distributions weight functions like @xmath46\\hspace*{4mm}\\nonumber \\\\ \\hspace*{10 mm } + n_v \\left({\\frac{y}{a}}\\right)^{\\alpha_v } \\left(1-{\\frac{y}{a}}\\right)^{\\beta_v }   + n_s \\left({\\frac{y}{a}}\\right)^{\\alpha_s } \\left(1-{\\frac{y}{a}}\\right)^{\\beta_s } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first two terms may be interpreted as reduction in the parent nucleon longitudinal momentum fraction , and in spite of their simplicity reproduce accurately emc and fermi motion effects .",
    "indeed , with just these three parameters the fit reproduces fairly well the large @xmath22 data , however it fails to account for antishadowing effects at intermediate @xmath22 , where valence distributions still dominate .    in order to include antishadowing effects",
    "we add the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rv ] ) , which induces a small enhancement of the distributions with @xmath47 and a mild @xmath22 dependence given by the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "notice that the convolution integral dilutes the @xmath22 dependence producing an effect similar to those predicted by parton recombination models @xcite",
    ". it would be pointless to try to extract from the data the nuclear modification to valence distributions in the low @xmath22 region , since this region is clearly dominated by sea and gluon densities , however the first three terms in eq.([eq : rv ] ) violate charge conservation . in order to remedy this situation we include the forth term , similar to the third but where charge conservation forces @xmath50 . in this case the weight function can not be interpreted as a probability density but as the result of the mechanism that compensate re - scaling and recombination effects .",
    "the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 are taken to be the parameters used for the sea quark densities , fixed by the low @xmath22 behavior of the data , while both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are fixed by momentum and charge conservation , eqs.([eq : r1 ] ) and ( [ eq : r2 ] ) .    for sea quarks and gluons ,",
    "the argument is just the opposite : the fit to data is not sensitive to any nuclear modification at high or intermediate @xmath22 , so the best choice for sea weight functions is found to be @xmath55 where the first term gives the gluon distribution in free protons and the eulerian function ( specifically the parameter @xmath51 ) drives the low @xmath22 shadowing ( @xmath56 is found to be negative ) .",
    "the three parameters , @xmath56 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are strongly constrained by the structure functions ratios at small @xmath22 and the drell - yan ratios .",
    "@xmath57 is just the normalization of the eulerian function , @xmath58 .",
    "similarly , for gluons @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is strongly constrained by the @xmath1-dependent @xmath61 data , whereas the exponents are taken to be the same as for the sea distributions and @xmath62 .",
    "no significant improvement is found assigning independent parameters for them .",
    "since @xmath53 and @xmath54 are constrained by momentum conservation in eqs.([eq : r1 ] ) and ( [ eq : r2 ] ) , there are 9 independent parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 for each nucleus .",
    "since no data is available on different isotopes of the same nucleus , in the following we drop the dependence on @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath8 dependence of all the parameters can be written @xmath66 the full parameterization of both the @xmath8 and @xmath22 dependence of nuclear effects imply in principle quite a lot of parameters ( 27 ) , however the mild @xmath8 dependence found in some of them allow to reduce their number .",
    "for example , @xmath51 , @xmath48 and @xmath67 can be taken as constant in @xmath8 loosing just a few units in @xmath68 but eliminating 6 parameters .",
    "in the following section we present results from the lo and nlo fits to nuclear data using the convolution approach . the data analysed include the most recent nmc and slac - e139 dis structure functions ratios to deuterium and carbon , selecting those measurements corresponding to @xmath69 gev , and also e772 drell - yan dilepton cross sections from proton nucleus collisions , as listed in table 1 , rendering a total number of 420 data points .",
