    "stellar feedback  the injection of energy and momentum by stars",
    " originates at the small scales of star clusters ( @xmath01 pc ) , yet it shapes the interstellar medium ( ism ) on large scales ( @xmath11 kpc ) . at large scales ,",
    "stellar feedback is necessary in order to form realistic galaxies in simulations and to account for observed galaxy properties . in the absence of feedback",
    ", baryonic matter cools rapidly and efficiently forms stars , producing an order of magnitude too much stellar mass and consuming most available gas in the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "stellar feedback prevents this `` cooling catastrophe '' by heating gas as well as removing low angular momentum baryons from galactic centers , thereby allowing only a small fraction of the baryonic budget of dark matter halos to be converted to stars .",
    "the removal of baryons may also flatten the dark matter mass profile , critical to form bulgeless dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , stellar feedback possibly drives kpc - scale galactic winds and outflows ( see @xcite for a review ) which have been frequently observed in local galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as in galaxies at moderate to high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    at the smaller scales of star clusters and giant molecular clouds ( gmcs )",
    ", newborn stars dramatically influence their environments .",
    "observational evidence suggests that only a small fraction ( @xmath212% ) of gmc mass is converted to stars per cloud free - fall time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this inefficiency can be attributed to stellar feedback processes of h  ii  regions that act to disrupt and ultimately to destroy their host clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the pressure of the warm ionized h  ii region gas itself , there are several other forms of stellar feedback that can drive the dynamics of h  ii regions and deposit energy and momentum in the surrounding ism : the direct radiation of stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the dust - processed infrared radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , stellar winds and supernovae ( sne ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and protostellar outflows / jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    from a theoretical perspective , sne were the first feedback mechanism to be considered as a means to remove gas from low - mass galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and to prevent the cooling catastrophe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , resolution limitations precluded the explicit modeling of individual sne in galaxy formation simulations , so phenomenological prescriptions were employed to account for `` sub - grid '' feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since then",
    ", extensive work has been done to improve and to compare these sub - grid models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the use of `` zoom - in '' simulations ( which can model feedback physics down to @xmath11 pc scale ) has enabled the modeling of several modes of feedback simultaneously ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    while simulations are beginning to incorporate many feedback mechanisms , most observational",
    "work focuses on the effects of the individual modes .",
    "consequently , the relative contribution of these components and which processes dominate in different conditions remains uncertain . to address this issue , we recently employed multiwavelength imaging of the giant h  ii  region n157 ( 30  doradus ; `` 30 dor '' hereafter ) to assess the dynamical role of several stellar feedback mechanisms in driving the shell expansion @xcite .",
    "in particular , we measured the pressures associated with the different feedback modes across 441 regions to map the pressure components as a function of position ; we considered the direct radiation pressure exerted by the light from massive stars , the dust - processed radiation pressure , the warm ionized ( @xmath3  k ) gas pressure , and the hot shocked ( @xmath4  k ) gas pressure from stellar winds and sne .",
    "we found that the direct radiation pressure from massive stars dominates at distances @xmath075 pc from the central star cluster r136 , while the warm ( @xmath5  k ) ionized gas pressure dominates at larger radii . by comparison , the dust - processed radiation pressure and the hot ( @xmath4  k ) gas pressure are weak and are not dynamically important on the large scale ( although small bubbles of the hot gas can have significant pressures ",
    "@xcite ; see appendix  [ app : hot gas ] of this paper for a discussion on how choice of hot gas filling factor is critical when evaluating the dynamical role of hot gas ) .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the methodology applied to 30  dor to a larger sample of 32 h  ii  regions in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , respectively ) , with the aim of probing how stellar feedback properties vary between sources .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sample ] describes our lmc and smc h  ii  region sample and the data we have employed for our analyses .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] outlines the methods we have used to assess the dynamical role of several stellar feedback mechanisms in the 32 sources .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the results from these analyses , and section  [ sec : discussion ] explores implications of our findings related to the importance of radiation pressure ( section  [ sec : radpressure ] ) , the confinement of hot gas in the h  ii  regions ( section  [ sec : leakage ] ) and the momentum deposition of the dust - processed radiation to the warm gas ( section  [ sec : dusty ] ) .",
    "finally , we summarize this work in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "for our feedback analyses , we selected the 16 lmc and 16 smc h  ii  regions of @xcite , who chose sources based on their bright 24@xmath6 m and h@xmath7 emission and which are distributed throughout these galaxies .",
    "we opted to include sources based on both ir and h@xmath7 , since bright h@xmath7 emission alone is not unique to h  ii  regions .",
    "for example , several of the emission nebulae identified by @xcite are now known to be supernova remnants .",
    "furthermore , bright 24@xmath6 m emission arises from stochastically heated small dust grains ( i.e. , dust is heated by collisions with starlight photons : e.g. , @xcite ) , so it is well - correlated with h  ii  regions within the milky way and other galaxies .",

    "we used the narrow - band image ( at 6563@xmath15 , with 30@xmath15 full - width half max ) that was taken with the university of michigan / ctio 61-cm curtis schmidt telescope at ctio as part of the magellanic cloud emission line survey ( mcels : @xcite ) .",

    "the smc was also surveyed by _ spitzer _ with the legacy program surveying the agents of galaxy evolution in the tidally stripped , low metallicity small magellanic cloud ( sage - smc : @xcite ) . this project mapped the full smc ( @xmath230 deg@xmath22 ) with irac and mips and built on the pathfinder program , the spitzer survey of the small magellanic cloud ( s@xmath23mc : @xcite ) , which surveyed the inner @xmath23 deg@xmath24 of the smc .",
    "sage - smc observations were taken at two epochs in 20072008 , and we employed the combined mosaics from both epochs ( plus the s@xmath23mc data ) .",
    "the lmc and smc were observed with the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) as part of 4.8-ghz and 8.64-ghz surveys @xcite .",
    "these programs had identical observational setups , using two array configurations that provided 19 antenna spacings , and the atca observations were combined with the parkes 64-m telescope data of @xcite to account for extended structure missed by the interferometric observations . for our analyses ,",

    "we searched these calibration data and merged all the observations where the _ chandra _ chip array imaged the full diameter of the sources : 52 observations for n76 , and 36 observations for n78 .",
    "we follow the same methodology as in our 30 dor pressure analysis @xcite with only a few exceptions , described below .",
    "instead of calculating spatially - resolved pressure components for the sources , we determine the average pressures integrated over the radii listed in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "thus , these pressure components are those `` felt '' within the h  ii  shells .",
    "we describe the uncertainties associated with the calculation of each term in section  [ sec : uncertainty ] .    to select the radius of each region , we produced surface brightness profiles of their h-@xmath7 emission , and we determined the apertures which contained 90% of the total h-@xmath7 fluxes .",
    "we opted for this phenomenological definition of the radii to reduce the systematic uncertainties between sources .",
    "as seen in figures  [ fig : lmcthreecolor ] and  [ fig : smcthreecolor ] , the h  ii  regions are quite complex , and the calculations below are simple and aimed to describe the general properties of these sources .",
    "the light output by stars produces a direct radiation pressure that is associated with the photons energy and momentum .",
    "the resulting radiation pressure @xmath28 at some position within the h  ii  region is related to the bolometric luminosity of each star @xmath29 and the distance @xmath30 the light traveled to reach that point :    @xmath31    where the summation is over all the stars in the region .",

    "we note that radiation pressure and radiation force do not always follow the same simple relationship as e.g. , gas pressure and force , where the force is the negative gradient of pressure .",
    "in particular , @xcite point out that in a relatively transparent medium ( such as the interior of an h  ii  region ) , it is possible for the radiation pressure to exceed the gas pressure while the local force exerted on matter by the radiation is smaller than the force exerted by gas pressure .",
    "however , at the h  ii  shells where the gas is optically thick to stellar radiation , radiation force and pressure follow the same relationship as gas force and pressure , and the radiation pressure defined by equation  [ eq : pdir ] is the relevant quantity to consider .",
    "to obtain @xmath29 of the stars in our 30 dor analyses , we employed ubv photometry of r136 from @xcite using hst planetary camera observations , and the ground - based data of @xcite and @xcite to account for stars outside r136 .",
    "while several large - scale optical surveys of the lmc have now been done and include ubv photometry ( e.g. , @xcite ) , these data do not resolve the crowded regions of young star clusters , and they focus principally on the ( uncrowded ) field population .",
    "an alternative means to estimate the bolometric luminosities of the star clusters is using the extinction - corrected h@xmath7 luminosities of the h  ii  regions . from @xcite , for a stellar population that fully samples the initial mass function ( imf ) and the stellar age distribution , the bolometric luminosity @xmath36 is related to the extinction - corrected h@xmath7 luminosity @xmath37 by the expression @xmath38 .",
    "we use the shassa and mcels data to estimate the observed h@xmath7 luminosities @xmath39 within the radii listed in table  [ tab : sample ] .    to correct for extinction , we employ the reddening maps of the lmc and smc presented in @xcite , from the third phase of the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle iii ) .",

    "the implication is that the ratio of h@xmath7 to bolometric luminosity of a stellar population evolves with time .",
    "the relation @xmath38 is appropriate for a population with a continuous star formation history over 100 myr , but for a nearly coeval stellar population as in our star clusters , the h@xmath7 to bolometric ratio will start out somewhat larger than kennicutt & evans value , then decline below it over a timescale of @xmath54 myr .",

    "we also note uncertainty related to imf sampling .",
    "stellar populations with masses below @xmath55 @xmath56 do not fully sample the imf , and this makes the h@xmath7 to bolometric luminosity ratio vary stochastically @xcite .",

    ", it has been debated in the literature how much momentum can be deposited in matter by ir photons .",
    "@xcite argued that the imparted momentum would be limited to @xmath228 a few because holes in the shell would cause the radiation to leak out of those pores .",
    "conversely , if every photon is absorbed many times , then all the energy of the radiation field is converted to kinetic energy of the gas ; this scenario imparts the most momentum to the shell .",
    "an intermediate case is in optically thick systems , where photons are absorbed at least once , and the momentum deposition is dependent on the optical depth @xmath229 of the region @xcite .",
    "recent simulations by @xcite indicate that @xmath230 can be large as long as the radiation flux is below a critical value that depends on the dust optical depth .",
    "this critical value corresponds to the radiation flux being large enough so that the pressure of the dust - trapped radiation field is at the same order of magnitude as the gas pressure . at fluxes above the critical value , a radiation - driven rayleigh - taylor ( rrt ) instability develops and severely limits the value of @xmath230 by creating low - density channels through which radiation can escape .",
    "for example , in one case in @xcite where the rrt instability does not develop , they obtain @xmath231 , whereas when the radiation flux is increased so that radiation forces become significant and there is instability , @xmath230 drops to a few . clearly in the case of our sources , we are in the regime where the radiation pressure is not dominant compared to the warm gas pressure , and rrt instability is not expected ( though two of our sources are near the threshold of instability ) .",
    "thus , the high values of @xmath230 we obtain are consistent with these models .",
    "in this paper , we have performed a systematic , multi wavelength analysis of 32 h  ii  regions in the magellanic clouds to assess the role of stellar feedback in their dynamics .",
    "we have employed optical , ir , radio , and x - ray images to measure the pressures associated with direct stellar radiation , dust - processed radiation , warm ionized gas , and hot x - ray emitting plasma at the shells of these sources . we have found that the warm ionized gas dominates over the other terms in all sources , although two h  ii  regions have comparable dust - processed components .",
    "the hot gas pressures are relatively weaker , and the direct radiation pressures are 12 orders of magnitude below the other terms .",
    "we explore three implications to this work .",
    "first , we emphasize that younger , smaller h  ii  regions , such as hypercompact h  ii  regions , should be studied to probe the role of direct radiation pressure and the hot gas at early times .",
    "secondly , the low x - ray luminosities and pressures we derive indicate the hot gas is only partially confined in all of our sources , suggesting that hot gas leakage is a common phenomenon in evolved h  ii  regions .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that the dust - processed component can be significant and comparable to warm gas pressure , even if the direct radiation pressure is comparatively less .",

    "one can attempt to deduce @xmath232 from a combination of morphology and spectral modeling ( as in e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , for the purposes of understanding the global dynamics , this approach can be misleading , as we demonstrate here .",
    "following the reasoning outlined below , we set @xmath234 .",
    "we are interested in the global dynamics of the regions , which are described by the virial theorem . neglecting magnetic fields ( which may not be negligible , but we lack an easy means to measure them ) , the eulerian form of the virial theorem is @xcite :          here , @xmath34 is the volume , @xmath9 is the surface of this volume , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath239 are the gas density , velocity , and pressure , @xmath240 is the fluid pressure tensor , @xmath241 is the frequency - integrated radiation energy density , @xmath242 is the radiation pressure tensor , @xmath200 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath243 is the identity tensor .",
    "the terms @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 , and @xmath247 may be identified , respectively , as the moment of inertia , the total thermal plus kinetic energy , the total radiation energy , and the gravitational binding energy .",
    "the terms subscripted with @xmath248 represent external forces exerted at the surface of the volume , and are likely negligible in comparison with the internal terms for an h  ii region with large energy input by massive stars .    since manifestly @xmath249",
    "either is very positive now , or was in the recent past ( otherwise the shell would not have expanded ) , the goal of this work is to understand the balance between the various positive terms on the right - hand side of the equation .",
    "the terms @xmath60 and @xmath32 are simply two different parts of @xmath246 , corresponding to energy stored in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , while @xmath121 and @xmath115 are part of @xmath245 . writing out the virial theorem in this manner makes the importance of the filling factor clear .",
    "the term we are interested in evaluating is the kinetic plus thermal energy of the x - ray emitting gas ,      where we have dropped the @xmath251 term on the assumption that the flow velocity is subsonic with respect to the hot gas sound speed , and in the second step we have defined the volume - averaged pressure @xmath252 , as distinct from the local pressure at a given point .",
    "the quantity @xmath252 can be understood as the partial pressure of the hot gas , including proper averaging down for whatever volumes it does not occupy .",
    "thus we see that the quantity of interest is _ not _ the local number density or pressure of the hot gas , it is the volume - averaged or partial pressure .",
    "now recall that , for fixed @xmath98 and fixed observed emission measure , local pressure scales with filling factor as @xmath253 , so a small volume filling factor increases @xmath115 .",
    "however , since the volume occupied by the hot gas scales as @xmath254 , it follows that @xmath255 , i.e. , a small volume filling factor implies that the hot gas is less , not more , important for the large - scale dynamics .",
    "this analysis has two important implications .",
    "first , the choice that makes the hot gas as dynamically - important as possible is to set @xmath256 , i.e. , to assume that the hot gas fills most of the available volume . in this case",
    "we simply have @xmath257 , and this is the choice we make in this work . a detailed assessment of @xmath232 that gives a value @xmath258 , as performed by @xcite ,",
    "can imply an even smaller dynamical role for the hot gas , but not a larger one ( although understanding of filling factors is important for other considerations , such as the internal dynamics of h  ii  regions ) .",
    "the second implication is that it is inconsistent to treat @xmath115 as the quantity of interest for the global dynamics while simultaneously adopting @xmath259 .",
    "once can certainly attempt to measure @xmath254 and thus obtain a more accurate assessment of @xmath115 , but in this case the quantities that should be compared with other pressures is @xmath260 , _ not _ @xmath115 .",
    "the volume - averaged pressure is the relevant quantity for global dynamics , not the local pressure .",
    "we note that the above discussion of the filling factor applies to the warm gas as well , and we have also assumed a filling factor of order unity for the warm 10@xmath90 k gas .                                                                    , c.  l. , krumholz , m.  r. , ballesteros - paredes , j. , et al.et  al .",
