    "entanglement , a highly enigmatic feature of quantum mechanics implies a non - local correlation between two ( or more ) quantum systems such that the description of their states has to be done in reference to the each other even when they are separated by space like interval . this is a direct consequence of the fact that a state of composite quantum system can be expressed as a linear supersposition of tensor product of the states corresponding to its different parts",
    "this was first pointed out by e. schrodinger @xcite and around the same time by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite who cited this property to question the compatibility of quantum mechanics with local realism .",
    "almost a half century back in a milestone paper , j. s. bell @xcite addressed this fundamental question raised by epr with the help of bell s inequality(bi ) whose violation denies the existence of local hidden variable ( lhv ) theories and validates the existence of epr like non - local correlation in quantum mechanical states .",
    "the demonstration of the violation of bi in experiments @xcite thus forms a fundamental test to validate quantum mechanics as the the right physical theory .",
    "subsequent works indicates that the bi has more general implication like quantum non - contextuality @xcite which means that the outcome of a particular measurement is determined independently of previous ( or simultaneous ) measurement of any set of mutually commutating observables @xcite .",
    "only when such set of observables commutes due to their space like separation , they correspond to the cases for which epr like non - local correlation is relevant .",
    "a true test of quantum non - contextuality thus requires exploration of entanglement like properties and the test for bi in commutating observables that are not spatially separated .",
    "availability of such experimental systems is not very common@xcite .    in this work",
    "we show that synthetically spin - orbit coupled ( ssoc ) ultra cold bosonic atoms that was recently realized in experiments @xcite provides a quatum system where bipartite entanglement like quantum correlation occurs between motional observables ( momentum ) and intrinsic observable ( spin ) of a given atom and thus provides us an unique opportunity to test the concept of quantum non - contextuality for commutative observables of same object , that are not spatially separated .",
    "ultra cold atomic systems @xcite are very clean , almost bereft of any thermal fluctuation and highly isolated from the classical envirornment and thereby form one of the most ideal quantum systems .",
    "spin - orbit coupled ultra cold atomic system @xcite is one of most significant development in recent times in this direction and particularly being explored extensively for the possibility of quantum simulating novel topological condensed matter phases @xcite with such spin - orbit coupled ultra cold atoms .    in this context",
    "our work extend the outreach of such ultra cold quantum system in a different direction by showing that it has the potential of testifying fundamental question associated with the quantum world such as non - contextuality .",
    "additionally the experiment on ssoc bose einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite already suggest that even though the system is interacting , its phase diagram can be understood from a non - interacting single - boson effective hamiltonian .",
    "therefore our results rigorously derived for spin - orbit coupled ultra cold bosonic atom may also be applied for ssoc bec which is a macroscopic quantum objects consists of a large number of atoms in quantum mechanical ground state .",
    "this provides an opportunity of studying quantum non contextuality , bi violation , entanglement like properties for a macroscopic and massive quantum objects , an instance which is not commonly available @xcite .    using well established definitions for entangled states",
    "we first demonstrate that the general quantum mechanical states of such ssoc ultra cold bosons satisfy the criterion of bipartitite entanglement and we quantify such entanglement with well known entanglement measure like entanglement entropy and concurrence .",
    "we particularly show how the dressed states of such atoms execute a rabi like oscillation between two different energy minimums in the momentum space and how such oscillation leads to the similar oscillation in well known entanglement measure like entanglement entropy and concurrence .",
    "finally we show how such entanglement between motional and spin - degrees of freedom can lead to the bi violation .",
    "the ssoc system considered here was experimentally realized in nist experiment @xcite and consists of ultra cold @xmath0rb atoms in two internal states , @xmath1 available in @xmath2 hyperfine state of @xmath3 electronic levels .",
    "a pair of counterpropagating raman lasers couple these states and the non - interacting / single - atom hamiltonian for the corresponding system can be written as @xmath4 . after performing a suitable pseudospin rotation on the above hamiltonian @xcite it can be rewritten as h_so=    ( k_x+k_o)^2 + & + & ( k_x - k_o)^2-    .",
    "[ hso ] here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are repectively atom and photon momentum , @xmath7 is the rabi coupling strength and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the detuning between the raman lasers and @xmath10 is the zeeman frequency .",
    "since the properties of the ultra cold bec of ssoc bosons can be understood through this non - interacting hamiltonian ( [ hso ] ) @xcite our subsequent discussion will be based on the hamiltonian .",
    "diagonalization of ( [ hso ] ) gives energy eigenvalues @xmath11 and the energy eigenstates as |g & = & c_+| , k_x + k_o + c_-| , k_x - k_o +    @xmath12 . here",
    "the suffix @xmath13 respectively denote ground and excited state of the dressed atom ( dressed states ) , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , such that    e & = & e_x + e_0 + a & = & 2 e_0 [ param ] and the states @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the bare spin - orbit eigenstates .",
    "it may be pointed out that even if the interaction is included in the mean field approximation , the condensate wave - function can be expressed as a linear combination of these bare spin - orbit eigenstates @xcite . since the atoms form a bec @xcite , @xmath5 in expression ( [ param ] )",
    "are determined from the minimum energy condition .",

    "now we investigate the entanglement like properties for this state ( [ ent ] ) and show that it satisfies the criterion for an bipartite entangled state where the entanglement is now not between spatially separated two subsystem for same degrees of freedom , but rather between two different degrees of freedom of the same system .",

    "since @xmath72 has atleast one negative eigenvalue , therefore acording to the ppt criterion it has entanglement between spin and momentum degree of freedom .",
