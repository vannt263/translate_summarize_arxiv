    "the region encompassing the stars hl / xz  tau , in the northeastern part of the l1551 dark cloud , has been the subject of many studies over the years .",
    "this region lies at a distance of 140 pc ( e.g. , kenyon et al . 1994 ; torres et al .",
    "2009 ) and it is particularly rich in hh jets , being one of the regions where this phenomenon was first identified ( mundt & fried 1983 ) .",
    "hl  tau is one of the most intensively studied t tauri stars . since the first proposal that this star is associated with a nearly edge - on circumstellar disk ( cohen 1983 ) , numerous studies have been carried out in order to image the proposed disk ( e.g. , sargent & beckwith 1991 ; wilner et al .",
    "1996 ; looney et al .",
    "this star has been proposed as the exciting source of a molecular outflow ( e.g. , torrelles et al .",
    "1987 ; monin et al .",
    "hl  tau is also the source of a collimated optical jet - counterjet system that has been extensively studied ( e.g. , mundt et al . 1990 ; rodrguez et al .",
    "1994 ; anglada et al .",
    "very recently , greaves et al .",
    "( 2008 ) presented high angular resolution maps at 1.3 cm of the jet - disk system in hl  tau .",
    "these authors reported the detection of a weak 1.3 cm source which they propose is a 14 m@xmath1 proto - planet orbiting at a radius of @xmath265 au around hl  tau .",
    "xz  tau , located @xmath225@xmath3 to the east of hl  tau , is a close binary system composed of a t tauri star and a cool companion separated by 0@xmath03 ( haas et al .",
    "xz  tau is also the source of an optical outflow , as revealed , e.g. , by the studies of mundt et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . the spectacular sequence of hubble space telescope ( hst ) images of krist et al .",
    "( 1999 ) shows evidence of the expansion of nebular emission , moving away from xz  tau with a velocity of @xmath270 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this bubble of nebular emission is different from the collimated jets seen in other young stars , for example hl  tau .",
    "recent new hst observations ( krist et al . 2008 ) revealed a succession of bubbles and a fainter counterbubble .",
    "in addition , they reveal that both components of the xz   tau binary are also driving collimated jets .",
    "krist et al .",
    "( 2008 ) proposed that the bubble is the result of a large velocity pulse in the collimated jet driven by the southern component of the xz  tau system .    in this letter , we present the results of sensitive high - angular resolution very large array ( vla ) observations at 1.3 cm and 7 mm of hl / xz  tau .",
    "these observations allowed us to map the dust emission from the disk of hl  tau at scales of @xmath27 au and reveal that xz  tau is actually a triple - star system with the southern optical component resolved into a close binary with a separation of only 13 au .",
    "observations at 7 mm continuum were made using the vla of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao )  .",
    "the data were taken in a , b and d configurations ( vla project codes : ac0763 , ac0850 and ac0816 ) .",
    "total on - source integration times were @xmath23  h at a configuration ( observed in three runs during 2004 october 15 , 17 and 26 ) , @xmath21  h at b configuration ( 2006",
    "september 19 ) , and @xmath21.5  h at d configuration ( observed in two runs during 2006 january 20 and 22 ) .",
    "the fast - switching technique was used for all the observations .",
    "phase and flux calibrators were 0431 + 175 and 3c286 , respectively .",
    "the same phase center was used for all the observations .",
    "we also used archive continuum data at 1.3  cm taken with the vla in its a configuration ( vla project code : ag0711 ) with a total on - source integration time of @xmath212  h ( observed in two runs during 2006 march 12 and april 1 ) .",
    "phase and flux calibrators were 0431 + 206 and 3c286 , respectively .",
    "the pie town antenna was used originally in these observations , but we did not include it in our analysis .        data editing and calibration were carried out using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) package of nrao , following the standard high - frequency vla procedures .",
    "primary beam corrections were applied using the task pbcor of aips .",
    "maps at 7 mm were made by concatenating the data from all the configurations ( a , b and d ) .",
    "this allowed us to improve by @xmath220% the signal - to - noise ratio of the a configuration data without significant detriment of the angular resolution .",
    "the 7 mm map of hl  tau shown here was made using data with baselines @xmath5150 k@xmath6 in order to resolve out extended emission that surrounds hl  tau .",
    "the nature of this extended emission is not fully understood , but probably originates from diffuse dust in the region .",
    "the 1.3 cm map of hl  tau shown in greaves et al .",
    "( 2008 ) was obtained from the same data , and , as expected , is very similar to our 1.3 cm map .",
    "the rms noises of the natural weighting maps were 13  @xmath7jy at 1.3 cm , and 50  @xmath7jy at 7 mm .",
    "synthesized beams are @xmath20@xmath010 at 1.3 cm and @xmath20@xmath005 at 7 mm .",
    "bandwidth smearing at the position of xz  tau degrades the resolution by @xmath25% in the radial direction , which does not affect our analysis .",

    "as previously noted by greaves et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the alignment of the 1.3 cm emission at p.a.@xmath1050@xmath9 with the optical jet of hl  tau ( e.g. anglada et al . 2007 ) , suggests that the 1.3 cm emission at this p.a . is tracing free - free emission from the shock - ionized gas at the base of the flow .",
    "in contrast , the 1.3 cm emission at p.a.@xmath10140@xmath9 is most probably tracing thermal dust emission from a circumstellar disk perpendicular to the outflow .",
    "this is more evident in our 7 mm map ( see fig .",
    "[ fighl]a ) , where the emission shows an elongated morphology with a p.a . of @xmath2140@xmath9 ( perpendicular to the jet ) and a size of @xmath250 au .",
    "the positions of the 1.3 cm and 7 mm maxima are nearly coincident and define the center of the radio jet .",
    "we also detected two weak compact 1.3 cm features , one @xmath20@xmath04 to the nw ( at a level of 3-@xmath11 ) and the other @xmath20@xmath04 to the s ( at a level of 4-@xmath11 ) of the 1.3 cm emission peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fighl]a ) .",
    "greaves et al .",
    "( 2008 ) identified the 1.3 cm nw feature with a 1.4 mm source detected by welch et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , obtaining a spectral index of 2.5 in this wavelength range .",
    "they proposed that the 1.3 cm nw feature is dust emission arising from a proto - planet with a mass of 14 m@xmath1 and orbiting around hl  tau at a radius of @xmath265 au .",
    "the other 1.3 cm feature to the s , although somewhat stronger than the nw feature , was not discussed by these authors .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fighl]a , we have not detected 7 mm emission at the position of the proto - planet candidate , with a 3-@xmath11 upper limit level of @xmath20.15 mjy .",
    "this upper limit and the 1.3 cm flux density of greaves et al .",
    "( 2008 ) implies a spectral index @xmath121 , suggesting free - free rather than dust emission . on the other hand , the spectral index of 2.5 between 1.3 cm and 1.4 mm obtained by greaves et al .",
    "( 2008 ) would imply a 7 mm flux density of 0.5 mjy , well above our 3-@xmath11 upper limit .",
    "additional , high angular resolution observations in the mm range are necessary to clarify the true nature of this source .    in figure",
    "[ fighl]b we show an intensity profile of the 7 mm emission along the major axis of the disk .",
    "as can be seen in figures [ fighl]a and [ fighl]b , the 7 mm emission is knotty and asymmetric .",
    "the proposed disk extends @xmath225 au to the se , and shows a gap at a radius of @xmath210 au and the emission to the nw appears truncated at a radius of @xmath212 - 15 au .",
    "the gap and the truncation are probably related to a decrease of the density in the disk .",
    "thus , since the disk is observed nearly edge - on ( e.g. cohen 1983 ) , this gap could be associated with an annulus of low density in the disk with a radius of @xmath210 - 15 au , similar to the radius of the orbit of saturn , or twice the orbit of jupiter .",
    "such structures are expected to form as a consequence of the accretion of a planetary object forming in the disk ( see , e.g. bryden et al .",
    "therefore , the gap and the truncation of the disk detected in our 7 mm map could be related to the formation of a proto - planet .",
    "alternatively , this gap could be due to tidal truncation in a binary system ( e.g. , pichardo et al .",
    "2005 ) as in the case of hh30 ( anglada et al . 2007 , guilloteau et al . 2008 ) .",
    "however , with the present data , these suggestions are very speculative , and should be confirmed by subsequent observations and/or modelling of the disk of hl  tau .          in figure",
    "[ figxz]a we show the 3.6 cm continuum map ( angular resolution @xmath100@xmath03 ) of xz  tau , obtained by rodrguez et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , where a single radio continuum source was detected .",
    "figures [ figxz]b and [ figxz]c show our 1.3 cm and 7 mm maps , respectively . at 1.3 cm ( angular resolution @xmath100@xmath01 ) ,",
    "xz  tau is resolved in two radio continuum sources ( labeled n and s ) separated by @xmath20@xmath03 with a p.a . of @xmath2143@xmath9 .",
    "the 7 mm map ( angular resolution @xmath100@xmath005 ) , reveals that the 1.3 cm component s is actually a double radio source ( that we label as components s1 and s2 ) with a separation of 0@xmath009 and a p.a . of @xmath136@xmath9 .",
    "the size of the synthesized beam of the 1.3 cm map ( @xmath20@xmath01 ) , slightly larger than the separation between the s1 and s2 components at 7 mm ( @xmath20@xmath009 ) , does not allow to completely separate the emission of these components at 1.3 cm .",
    "however , the 1.3 cm source s is marginally resolved in our map , showing a slight elongation to the south . in figure",
    "[ figxz]b we show the positions of the components s1 and s2 derived from the 7 mm map .",
    "as can be seen , most of the 1.3 cm emission seems to arise from component s1 , since this is the source nearest to the peak of the 1.3 cm source s. the 1.3 cm source s can be fitted by two unresolved gaussian sources separated by @xmath20@xmath008 , very similar to the separation between sources s1 and s2 in the 7 mm map .    in table",
    "[ tabxz ] we give the position ( derived from the 7 mm map ) , flux density at 1.3 cm and 7 mm , and the spectral index for each component .",
    "for source n , we obtained a spectral index of 1.1 @xmath8 1.0 consistent with free - free emission from this source .",
    "for source s as a whole , we obtained a `` combined '' spectral index of 2.5 @xmath8 0.3 ( obtained from the total flux density of the 1.3 cm source s , and the sum of the 7 mm flux densities of s1 and s2 ) .",
    "this steep spectral index suggests a combination of free - free plus thermal dust emission .",
    "if we use the flux densities obtained from a double gaussian fit to the 1.3 cm source s , for source s1 we obtain a spectral index of 1.9 @xmath8 0.3 which suggests a combination of free - free plus thermal dust emission .",
    "in contrast , for s2 we obtain a spectral index of 3.4 @xmath8 0.7 which suggests that the emission of this source is dominated by thermal dust emission .",
    "as mentioned above , xz  tau is known to be an optical / ir binary system with a separation of @xmath20@xmath03 . following the notation of krist et al . (",
    "2008 ) , we will refer to the optical components of this system as xz  tau  a ( the southern optical component ) and xz  tau  b ( the northern optical component ) .",
    "krist et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2008 ) observed xz  tau with the hst in several epochs , and detected a change in the p.a .",
    "of the binary due to orbital motions .",
    "according to this motion ( @xmath140.9 deg yr@xmath4 ) at the epoch of our radio observations , component xz  tau  b must be still located north of component xz  tau  a. therefore , we identify the radio source n with the optical component xz  tau  b.    the identification of the two radio sources at the south ( s1 and s2 ) with the other optical component ( xz  tau  a ) is not straightforward .",
    "one possibility is that both radio sources have optical emission that could not be resolved by the hst observations of krist et al .",
    "however , another possibility is that only one of the radio sources is the counterpart of the optical component . in order to investigate these possibilities ,",
    "we have plotted in figures [ figorb]a and [ figorb]b the p.a . and separation of the optical binary measured in each epoch together with the p.a.s and separations between the different radio components measured from our 1.3 cm and 7 mm maps . as can be seen , the p.a . and separation between the radio sources n and s1 seems to be the only one compatible with the previous optical / ir data .",
    "this suggests radio source s1 as the sole counterpart to the optical component xz  tau  a ; s2 is optically undetected .",
    "this is similar to the case of the close binary svs  13 , where both components are detected at cm wavelengths , but only one object is detected in the optical regime ( anglada et al .",
    "2004 ) . as we have discussed above",
    ", the radio emission of component s2 seems to be dominated by thermal dust emission .",
    "we believe that this source traces a star since if it not were gravitationally bound , it would quickly dissipate .",
    "the size of sb is smaller than 7 au , that expanding at only 1  km  s@xmath4 , will dissipate in only 30 years .",
    "then , we conclude that this dust must be gravitationally bound to a star and it is most possibly an envelope or a disk .",
    "this suggests that source s2 is a more deeply embedded object so it is not surprising that it is optically very faint .",
    "therefore , we propose that the radio source s2 is an optically invisible third component of the xz  tau system . for consistency with the previous nomenclature , we call this component xz  tau  c.    in summary , the results derived from our 1.3 cm and 7 mm maps suggest that xz  tau , previously known as a binary system , is actually a triple star - system ( see figs . [ figorb]c and [ figorb]d ) . the previously known optical / ir components , xz  tau  a and xz  tau  b , have 1.3 cm and 7 mm counterparts and are separated by 42 au",
    ". a third component , xz  tau  c has been detected for the first time in our 1.3 cm and 7 mm maps , and is found to be a more deeply embedded object , probably undetectable at optical / ir wavelengths , that forms a close binary system with xz  tau  a with a separation of only 13 au .",
    "each optical component of the xz  tau system ( a and b ) is known to drive a collimated jet ( krist et al 2008 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the jet of xz  tau  a underwent a large velocity pulse approximately in 1980 ( krist et al .",
    "2008 ) which , after shocking and heating the gas near the star , would result in the 70 km s@xmath4 expanding bubble detected in the series of hst images of krist et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2008 ) .",
    "these authors explored the possibility that this ejection was triggered by the passage of component xz  tau  b very near component xz  tau  a. however , even assuming a very eccentric orbit ( e@xmath100.9 ) they derived that the last approach of these components would have taken place in 1955 , and thus , they discarded this possibility .",
    "the discovery of a new companion , closer to xz  tau  a , suggests that it is once more feasible to consider the passage of this companion as the ejection trigger . if we assume a face - on , nearly circular ( e@xmath100.1 ) orbit and a total mass of 1 m@xmath15 ( as suggested by the results of krist et al .",
    "1999 and white & ghez 2001 ) , we derive an orbital period of @xmath240 yr . if at the time of our 7 mm observations ( 2004.8 ) the xz  tau  a - c system wass near apoastron , then the last periastron passage must have taken place one half - period before , i.e. nearly 1980 , the date estimated for the ejection .",
    "further observations are needed to produce a more accurate ephemeris for the xz tau system .",
    "the present results predict a new periastron passage around 2020 , and then a new major ejection from xz  tau  a at this epoch .",
