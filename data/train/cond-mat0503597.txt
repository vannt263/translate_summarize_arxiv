    "there appears to be no experimental data available on the bulk moduli of other cubic rare earth sesquicarbides to compare with .",
    "the bulk modulus of la@xmath0c@xmath8 at 30  gpa is about 250  gpa .",
    "this value would be an upper limit for the ambient - pressure bulk modulus @xmath36 of y@xmath0c@xmath1 ; it is much lower than the calculated one ( @xmath36 = 363 gpa ) reported in ref ..    at ambient conditions , the volume per la@xmath0c@xmath1 formula unit ( 85.68 @xmath41 ) is smaller than that of the constituents la metal and carbon in the diamond modification ( la metal 37.5 @xmath41/la , diamond 5.67 @xmath41/c , 2 @xmath42 37.5 + 3 @xmath42 5.67 = 92.0 @xmath41 ) .",
    "so , the @xmath43 term in the free energy difference favors the formation of the compound under pressure .",
    "however , because of the large compressibility of la metal [ @xmath36(la ) @xmath44 25  gpa , ref . ] , the @xmath43 term changes sign at about 5  gpa ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "hence , la@xmath0c@xmath1 is not necessarily a thermodynamically stable phase at all pressures covered in our experiment .",
    "a high - temperature experiment performed above 5  gpa may result in decomposition or , perhaps , the formation of a metal - rich carbide .",

    "the dicarbide anions are centered at the interstitial 12a site ( @xmath47 ) and oriented along the @xmath48 axes of the bisphenoids ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) whose shape depends on the positional parameter @xmath32 @xcite . for la@xmath0c@xmath1 we have @xmath32(la ) @xmath49 which is intermediate between nearly equal lengths of all edges ( @xmath50 ) and equal center - corner distances ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "near @xmath52 the metal - metal coordination is @xmath53 and the bisphenoids can host elongated entities .    within the uncertainty of our data , the positional parameter @xmath32(la ) stays constant under pressure ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this means that the coordination polyhedron around c@xmath0 is compressed isotropically , and there is no change in the second neighbor coordination .",
    "actually , at ambient pressure the @xmath32 parameters of all cubic rare earth and actinide sequicarbides cluster around 0.051 with a quite narrow spread of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the arrangement of metal ions in la@xmath0c@xmath1 is similar to that of the ci16 ( 16-atom body centered cubic ) phase of high - pressure li which can be interpreted as a @xmath55 superstructure of bcc @xcite . in li - ci16",
    "a pseudo - gap is formed , involving a lowering of the density of states @xmath56 at the fermi level , which leads to a decrease of the total energy relative to any of the common high - symmetry phases of elemental metals . despite the pseudo - gap formation ,",
    "the ci16 phase of li is a superconductor with @xmath57 10  k ( see ref . and literature cited therein ) . as for la@xmath0c@xmath1 , the fermi level is calculated to also fall into a local minimum of the dos @xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to what is reported for y@xmath0c@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "the latter value agrees with ref .. despite the larger carbon to metal ratio , the bulk modulus of lac@xmath0 comes out slightly lower compared to la@xmath0c@xmath1 .",
    "this may be explained by the larger metal - metal distance in lac@xmath0 ( 12 @xmath42 3.93    at ambient pressure ) compared to the average value for la@xmath0c@xmath1 ( 3 @xmath42 3.63   , 2 @xmath42 3.81   , 6 @xmath42 4.01   ) .",

    "it is left to a separate study to find out whether lac@xmath0 undergoes a reversible pressure - induced phase transition . already at ambient pressure ,",

    "so , application of pressure should be a strong driving force for a phase change , not ruling out at this point a pressure - induced amorphization as a precursor to phase separation .",
