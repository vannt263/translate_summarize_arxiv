    "strange stars made entirely of strange quark matter ( sqm ) have long been proposed as an alternative to neutron stars ( alcock , farhi , & olinto 1986 ; haensel , zdunik , & schaeffer 1986 ; glendenning 1996 ; cheng , dai , & lu 1998 ; weber 1999 ; cheng & harko 2000 ; alford & reddy 2003 ; lugones & horvath 2003 and references therein ) . the possible existence of strange stars is a direct consequence of the conjecture that sqm , composed of deconfined @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 quarks , may be the absolute ground state of the strong interaction , i.e. , it is absolutely stable with respect to @xmath4fe @xcite .",
    "if sqm is approximated as a noninteracting gas of quarks , chemical equilibrium with respect to the weak interaction , together with the relatively large mass of the @xmath1 quarks imply that the @xmath1 quarks are less abundant than the other quarks . hence in sqm electrons",
    "are required to neutralize the electric charge of the quarks .",
    "the electron density at vanishing pressure is of the order of @xmath5 of the quark density @xcite .",
    "the electrons , being bounded to sqm by the electromagnetic interaction alone , are able to move freely across the sqm surface , but clearly they can not move to infinity , because of the bulk electrostatic attraction to the quarks .",
    "the distribution of electrons extends several hundred fermis above the sqm surface , and an enormous electric field @xmath6 v  @xmath7 is generated in the surface layer to prevent the electrons from escaping to infinity , counterbalancing the degeneracy and thermal pressure @xcite .",
    "the thin layer of electrons with a very strong electric field , which is called the `` electrosphere '' , drastically affects the observational appearance of strange stars .",
    "first , the electrosphere of a hot strange star with a bare sqm surface may be responsible for its thermal emission in a wide range of the surface temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the point is that the electric field at the elecrosphere is a few ten times higher than the critical field @xmath9 v  @xmath7 , at which vacuum is unstable to creation of @xmath10 pairs @xcite .",
    "therefore , a hot strange star with a bare sqm surface may be a powerful source of @xmath10 pairs which are created in the electrosphere and flow away from the star ( usov 1998 , 2001a ; aksenov , milgrom , & usov 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "emission of @xmath10 pairs from the electrosphere dominates in the thermal emission of a bare strange star at @xmath11 k , while below this temperature , @xmath12 k , bremsstrahlung radiation of photons from electron - electron collisions in the electrosphere prevails @xcite . besides",
    ", the flux of photons generated in the surface layer of sqm via any mechanism ( for example , quark - quark bremsstrahlung ) may be strongly reduced in the process of propagation through the electrosphere @xcite .",
    "second , the surface electric field may be also responsible for existence of a crust of `` normal '' matter ( ions and electrons ) at the sqm surface of a strange star @xcite .",
    "this field is directed outward , and the ions in the inner layer are supported against the gravitational attraction to the underlying strange star by the electric field .    recently , it was argued that the properties of the electrospheres may be changed essentially because of the surface effects @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to study the structure of the electrospheres by taking into account the surface effects in details . the different qcd phases of sqm are also considered .",
    "the inclusion of the surface effects drastically modifies the structure of the electrosphere , by modifying the surface electric fields and the number density of the electrons .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we formulate the equations that describe the distributions of the electric fields and the density of the electrons is the electrosphere and the boundary conditions . in ",
    "3 we obtain the solutions of the equations describing the properties of the electrosphere and discuss their properties .",
    "finally , in  4 we summarize our results and discuss some astrophysical applications .",
    "in the electrosphere , electrons are held to the sqm surface by an extremely strong electric field .",
    "the thickness of the electrosphere is much smaller than the stellar radius @xmath13 cm , and a plane - parallel approximation may be used to study its structure . in this approximation all values depend only on the coordinate @xmath14 , where the axis @xmath14 is perpendicular to the sqm surface ( @xmath15 ) and directed outward . to find the distributions of electrons and electric fields in the vicinity of the sqm surface , we use a simple thomas - fermi model considered by alcock et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and take into account both the finite temperature effects and the surface tension of sqm as discussed by kettner et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and usov ( 2004 ) , respectively . in the present paper we use units so that @xmath16 . in these units",
    ", @xmath17 is equal to @xmath18 .",
    "the chemical equilibrium of the electrons in the electric field implies that the value @xmath19 is constant , where @xmath20 is the electrostatic potential , and @xmath21 is the electron s chemical potential . since far outside the star both @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "tend to 0 , it follows that @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the number density of the electrons is connected with the electron s chemical potential by the following expression @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath8 is the temperature of the electron layer , which is assumed constant in the layer and taken equal to the surface temperature of sqm .",
    "this is a very reasonable assumption because the thickness of the electron layer is very small , and the electron density is very high .",
    "therefore , the electrons have to be nearly in thermodynamic equilibrium with the sqm surface .",
    "in the main part of the electrosphere the energy of electrons is significantly higher than the mass @xmath25 , and the ultrarelativistic approximation when the energy of electrons is @xmath26 may be used . in this approximation",
    "the poisson equation takes the form @xcite : @xmath27\\,,\\,\\,z < 0\\ , , \\label{d2v<0}\\ ] ] @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath30 is the quark charge density .    the boundary conditions for equations ( [ d2v<0 ] ) and ( [ d2v>0 ] ) are @xmath31 and @xmath32 as @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 , respectively .    to solve the poisson equation and to find the distributions of electric fields and electrons",
    "it is necessary to know the quark charge density . in the following we consider the quark charge density for different qcd phases of sqm with taking into account the surface effects .      for sqm made of noninteracting quarks the electric charge of",
    "the quarks is positive .",
    "since sqm in bulk has to be electroneutral , electrons are required to neutralize the electric charge of the quarks .",
    "the chemical potential ( @xmath37 ) of these electrons at zero temperature is usually used to characterize the quark charge density , @xmath38 .",
    "below , we use only the chemical potential of electrons for sqm in bulk , and the tilde - sign is omitted .",
    "it is noted above that in noninteracting sqm the quarks are electrically charged because @xmath1 quarks are more massive than @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks .",
    "the mass of @xmath1 quarks is likely between 50 and 300 mev .",
    "the most traditional estimate is @xmath39 mev .",
    "the masses of @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks are less than 10  mev , and we consider these light quarks as massless particles , @xmath40 . since @xmath41 , we neglect the mass of electrons too , @xmath42 .",
    "chemical equilibrium under weak reactions imposes @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the average quark chemical potential .    at low temperatures ( @xmath45 ) , in thermodynamic equilibrium the number density of quarks",
    "are @xmath46    electrical neutrality requires @xmath47    equations ( [ muusd ] ) - ( [ qe0 ] ) yield @xmath48^{3/2}=0\\ , , \\label{eqx}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "figure 1 shows a numerical solution of equation ( [ eqx ] ) .",
    "this solution may be fitted by the following expression @xmath51 with the accuracy more than 1% for @xmath52 .",
    "the analytical estimate @xmath53 performed by alford & rajagopal ( 2002 ) at @xmath54 is well consistent with equation ( [ muefit ] ) .    for strange stars ,",
    "the value of @xmath55 is @xmath56 mev at the surface and @xmath57 mev at the center . taking @xmath58 mev and @xmath59 mev as typical parameters of sqm at vanishing pressure , from equation ( [ muefit ] ) we have @xmath60 mev .",
    "this value of @xmath21 is usually used in consideration of the properties of noninteracting sqm .",
    "however , the range , where @xmath21 may vary , is very wide , from @xmath61 mev to @xmath62 mev .",
    "it is becoming widely accepted that because of an attractive interaction between quarks in some specific channels , the ground state of sqm is a color superconductor ( e.g. , bailin & love 1984 ; alford , rajagopal , & wilczek 1998 ; rapp et al .",
    "1998 ; evans et al .",
    "2000 ; sch@xmath63fer 2000 ; alford 2001 ; alford , bowers , & rajagopal 2001a ) . at asymptotic densities ( @xmath64 ) , this superconductor is likely to be in the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase in which quarks of all three flavors and three colors are paired in a single condensate , where @xmath65 @xmath66 is the normal nuclear density .",
    "unfortunately , at intermediate densities ( @xmath67 ) that are relevant to the sqm surface layers of strange stars , the qcd phase of sqm is uncertain . in this low density regime",
    ", the sqm may be not only in the cfl phase , but also in the `` two color - flavor superconductor '' ( 2sc ) phase in which only @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks of two color are paired in a single condensate , while the ones of third color and the s quarks of all three colors are unpaired .",
    "however , it was recently argued that the density range where the 2sc phase may exist is small , if any @xcite .",
    "if rather low temperatures ( @xmath68 ) the cfl phase in bulk is electrically neutral in the absence of any electrons , i.e. , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 denotes the superconducting gap , @xmath71 mev ( rajagopal & wilczek 2001 ; steiner , reddy , & prakash 2002 ; weber 2004 ) .",
    "the reason for the electrical neutrality is that bcs - like pairing minimizes the energy if the quark fermi momenta are equal . in turn , for equal fermi momenta , the numbers of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 quarks are equal , and the electric charge of the quarks is zero .",
    "this differs qualitatively from the case of noninteracting sqm . at very high temperatures ( @xmath72 )",
    "the chemical potential of electrons in the cfl phase may be roughly estimated as @xmath73 , where @xmath21 is given by equation ( [ muefit ] ) @xcite .    in the 2sc phase the chemical potential of electrons is , as rule , higher that the value given by equation ( [ muefit ] ) for noninteractiong sqm , and it may be roughly estimated as @xmath74 ( huang & shovkovy 2003 and references therein ) . numerically , for the 2sc phase in bulk at vanishing pressure",
    "we have @xmath75 mev .    in the cfl and 2sc phases ,",
    "the cooper pairs are made of quarks with equal and opposite momenta .",
    "another possibility is a crystalline color superconductor ( ccs ) , which involves pairing between quarks whose momenta do not add to zero ( alford , bowers , & rajagopal 2001b ; bowers & rajagopal 2002 ) .",
    "besides , recently it is shown that the gapless color - flavor locked ( gcfl ) and gapless two color - flavor superconductor ( g2sc ) phases may also exist in addition to the regular cfl and 2sc phases @xcite . in the ccs , gcfl , and g2sc phases , electrons are present , and it is plausible that their chemical potential is also in the range from @xmath76 mev to 80 mev .",
    "the density of quark states near the surface of sqm is modified and differs from the density of quark states in bulk @xcite .",
    "this results in sharp increase of quark charge density at the sqm surface .",
    "indeed , the change in number of quarks of flavor @xmath77 per unit area because of surface tension is ( madsen 2000 , 2001 ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 , \\label{psi}\\ ] ] @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the fermi momentum of quarks of flavor @xmath77 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the rest mass of quarks of flavor @xmath77 .",
    "the value of @xmath84 is always negative , approaching zero for @xmath85 ( massless quarks ) .",
    "the rest masses of @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks are very small , and their densities are not modified significantly by the surface .",
    "thus , the only appreciable contribution to the surface corrections arises from the @xmath1 quarks , i.e. , surface effects are highly flavor dependent . because of surface depletion of @xmath1 quarks a thin charged layer forms at the surface of sqm .",
    "the charge per unit area is positive and equals @xmath86    the thickness of the charged layer at the sqm surface of sqm is of order of @xmath87 cm , which is a typical strong interaction length scale .",
    "the thickness of the electron distribution in the electrosphere is about two order more than the thickness of the charged layer formed at the surface of sqm because of surface depletion of @xmath1 quarks ( see alcock et al .",
    "1986 ; kettner et al .",
    "1995 and below ) , and therefore , we assume that the last is infinitesimal . in this case , the @xmath14 component of the electric field @xmath88 is discontinuous at the sqm surface ( @xmath15 ) , and the electric field jump is @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the @xmath92components of the electric field at the external ( @xmath93 ) and internal ( @xmath94 ) sides of the sqm surface , respectively .    for @xmath39 mev and @xmath95 mev , from equations ( [ nis ] ) - ( [ de ] ) we have @xmath96 that is about ten times larger than the surface electric field calculated for sqm in the unpaired phase when the surface effects are neglected @xcite .",
    "therefore , the charged layer formed at the surface of sqm because of surface depletion of @xmath1 quarks changes the structure of electrospheres essentially ( see below ) .",
    "the thermal effects have been neglected in the derivation of equation ( [ nis ] ) . however , since the thermal energy is small in comparison with the energy of quarks even if the temperature is as high as a few ten mev , this approximation does nt affect the conclusions of this paper .",
    "in our study the thermal effects for electrons in the electrosphere are taken into account because a strange star at the moment of formation may have the surface temperature @xmath8 comparable with the fermi energy of electrons inside sqm .",
    "the first integrals of equations ( [ d2v<0 ] ) and ( [ d2v>0 ] ) , which satisfy the boundary conditions at @xmath97 , are @xmath98 @xmath99^{1/2 } \\label{d1v<0}\\ ] ] and @xmath100 at @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .    outside of the sqm surface ( @xmath102 ) the @xmath92component of the electric field is directed outward ( @xmath103 ) to prevent electrons of the electrosphere from their escaping .",
    "therefore , the sign minus has to be chosen in equation ( [ d1v>0 ] ) , and the external electric field is @xmath104    this equation is valid for any numerical values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "the direction of the internal electric field may be different depending on the values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .    at present , the following two cases were considered . in the first case",
    "when @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the internal electric field is directed outward similar to the external electric field @xcite . in the second case",
    "when @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the electric field is symmetric with respect to the sqm surface [ @xmath115 , i.e. , the internal electric field is directed inward @xcite .    in the last case",
    "the electric field is discontinuous at the sqm surface , and its strength is equal to @xmath116 at @xmath15 .",
    "before to consider the internal electric field in a general case when @xmath113 and @xmath117 , we find a value of @xmath118 at which the internal electric field is zero for a given value of @xmath106 .    from equations ( [ ezdvz ] ) and ( [ d1v<0 ] ) , we have a solution @xmath119 if @xmath120 at @xmath121 . at the sqm surface the electrostatic potential @xmath20 is continuous , and therefore , @xmath122 for this solution , while the electric field is discontinuous , @xmath123 .",
    "substituting @xmath90 from this equation into equation ( [ ez>0 ] ) where @xmath120 we get @xmath124    to characterize importance of the surface effects for generation of strong electric fields in the vicinity of the sqm surface we introduce the following parameter : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the strength of the external electric field given by equation ( [ ez>0 ] ) at @xmath120 .",

    "hence , both the cases ( @xmath131 and @xmath153 ) may occur in the electrospheres of bare strange stars depending on the surface temperature and the sqm parameters . since the internal electric field is directed outward at @xmath154 and inward at @xmath155 , the sign @xmath156 or @xmath157",

    "we see that the external field at the sqm surface is extremely high [ @xmath172 that is about ten times more than the same without taking into account the surface effects .",

    "1986 ; kettner et al . 1995 ) where the surface effects were ignored .",
    "then , from equations ( [ nezt ] ) and ( [ ez>0 ] ) taken at @xmath191 we find that at the sqm surface the external electric field ( @xmath192 ) and the density of electrons ( @xmath193 ) increase because of the surface effects by factors 8.6 and 25 , respectively , and they are @xmath194 and @xmath195 @xmath196 .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the structure of extremely strong electric fields and the distribution of the density of electrons in the vicinity of the sqm surface of a bare strange star .",
    "it is taken into account that a very thin ( a few fm ) charged layer forms at the sqm surface because of surface depletion of @xmath1 quarks .",
    "we have shown that the surface charged layer changes significantly both the field structure and the density of electrons as compared with the same calculated in many papers ( e.g. , alcock et al .",
    "1986 ; kettner et al . 1995 ; hu & xu 2002 ; cheng & harko 2003 ) , where the surface effects are ignored .",
    "these changes are especially large if the surface temperature is not very high ( @xmath197 a  few mev ) .    for a bare strange star the structure of electric fields and the density of electrons near the stellar surface depend on @xmath171 , @xmath55 , and @xmath8",
    "[ see equations ( [ nezt ] ) , ( [ ez>0 ] ) - ( [ z0 ] ) , ( [ dvdzf ] ) - ( [ v0sqm ] ) and  2 ] . for sqm at vanishing pressure",
    "the value of @xmath55 is about 300 mev with accuracy of about 20% , and the main uncertainty of the parameters of the electrospheres of bare strange stars is because of uncertainty of @xmath171 that is estimated as 150 mev within a factor of 2 - 3 or so .    the density of electrons in the electrosphere of a bare strange star increases because of the surface effects by a factor of few ten ( see   3 )",
    "this may change significantly the thermal emission from the stellar surface . in the introduction",
    ", the main mechanisms of the thermal emission are mentioned .",
    "they are creation of @xmath10 pairs in a supercritical electric field @xcite , quark - quark bremsstrahlung from the surface layer of sqm @xcite , and electron - electron bremsstrahlung from the electron layer @xcite . in supercritical electric fields , @xmath198 ,",
    "the rate of pair production when electrons are created into the empty quantum states is extremely high @xcite , and all the empty states are occupied by creating electrons practically instantly .",
    "then , the rate of pair production in the electrosphere is determined by the process of thermalization of electrons which favors the empty - state production @xcite . using this , we have roughly the following dependence of the strange star luminosity in @xmath10 pairs on @xmath110 : @xmath199 where we use @xmath110 which is connected with the density of electrons at the electrosphere [ see equation ( [ nezt ] ) ] .    for the most conservative parameters of sqm ( @xmath39 mev and @xmath59 mev ) ,",
    "the value @xmath110 increase @xmath200 times because of the surface effects .",
    "hence , at high temperatures @xmath201 may increase up to a few ten times in comparison with the value calculated by usov ( 1998 ) for the electrosphere model where the surface effects are ignored .",
    "it has been shown by cheng & harko ( 2003 ) that quark - quark bremsstrahlung ( and another radiation from sqm ) may be strongly suppressed in the process of its propagation through the electrosphere . most probably , the increase of the density of electrons by a factor of @xmath202 because of the surface effects results in almost complete suppression of the outgoing radiation from sqm if the surface temperature is not very high ( @xmath203 ) . in this case",
    "practically all radiation of a bare strange star is generated by the electron layer at @xmath102 . in contrary",
    ", we expect that the electron density increase does nt affect significantly the electron - electron bremsstrahlung radiation from the electrosphere at rather low temperature ( @xmath204 ) where this radiation prevails .",
    "indeed , in this case the bremsstrahlung radiation is generated mainly at the distance from the sqm surface where the local plasma frequency of electrons is equal to the frequency of radiation ( jaikumar et al .",
    "2004 ) . since at any temperature the plasma frequency of electrons is connected directly with the density of electrons , the density of electrons in the radiating region is more or less the same irrespective of the structure of the electron layer .",
    "therefore , the electron - electron bremsstrahlung radiation at a given frequency is more or less the same , too .",
    "we hope to deal with detail calculations of the thermal emission from a bare strange star for the electrosphere model developed in this paper elsewhere .",
    "recently , the cooling of young bare strange stars has been studied numerically using the electrosphere model where the surface depletion of @xmath1 quarks is ignored @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the thermal luminosity of such a star in photons and @xmath10 pairs may be up to @xmath205 ergs  s@xmath175 for a few second after the star formation and remains high enough ( @xmath206 ergs  s@xmath175 ) as long as the surface temperature is higher than @xmath150 mev .",
    "the increase of the density of electrons in the electrosphere because of the surface effects has to modify the light curves calculated by page & usov ( 2002 ) .",
    "we expect that at the first stage of the strange star cooling , when the neutrino losses dominate , the thermal radiation from the stellar surface increases in accordance with equation ( [ lpm ] ) , i.e. , by a factor of few ten at @xmath207 . at the second stage ,",
    "when the losses in the surface thermal radiation prevails , the thermal luminosity decreases more fast than in the case of the non - modified electrosphere , especially at low temperatures ( @xmath208 mev ) where the main mechanism of the thermal emission is the electron - electron bremsstrahlung that is ignored by page & usov ( 2002 ) .    at the surface of a strange star a massive normal matter crust may be formed by accretion of matter onto the star . from figure",
    "3 we can see that at rather low temperatures ( @xmath209 mev ) the electrostatic potential of electrons @xmath210 is more than the electron chemical potential ( @xmath211 mev ) at which neutron drip occurs @xcite .",
    "therefore , the maximum density of the crust is limited by neutron drip and is about @xmath212 g  @xmath196 @xcite . in this case , the maximum mass of the crust is @xmath213 .",

    "<S> the quark surface holds the electron layer by an extremely strong electric field , generated in the electrosphere to prevent the electrons from escaping to infinity by counterbalancing the degeneracy and thermal pressure . because of the surface tension and depletion of @xmath1 quarks a very thin ( a few fm ) charged layer of quarks forms at the surface of the star . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of this layer modifies the structure of the electrosphere , by significantly changing the electric field and the density of the electrons , in comparison with the case when the surface effects are ignored . </S>",
