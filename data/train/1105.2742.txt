    "this happens if and only if the function @xmath107 defined above has asymptotic values @xmath56 in @xmath115 .    to prove the second part of theorem 2",
    ", we need to find which part of the spectral locus corresponds to real @xmath58 .",
    "assigning asymptotic values in sectors @xmath116 is not enough to define a nevanlinna function @xmath41 , one needs additional information about the topology of the covering @xmath117 such information is encoded in the following way @xcite .",
    "one chooses a cell decomposition @xmath118 of the riemann sphere @xmath119 such that each 2-cell contains one asymptotic value , and takes the @xmath41-preimage of this cell decomposition .",
    "this preimage is a cell decomposition @xmath120 of the plane which locally looks like @xmath118 .",
    "there are many ways to choose @xmath118 , and here we describe cell decompositions used by nevanlinna , see also ( * ? ? ?",

    "this choice of @xmath118 is fixed in this section .",
    "the preimage @xmath124 is called the _ line complex_. it has the following property : _ the @xmath123-skeleton of @xmath120 is a bipartite connected graph embedded in @xmath42 whose all vertices have degree @xmath78 , and each component of the complement has either two or infinitely many edges on the boundary .",
    "moreover , the number of components having infinitely many boundary edges is finite . _",
    "these properties completely characterize all possible line complexes arising from nevanlinna functions .",
    "this means that for arbitrary line complex , and asymptotic values ( naevanlinna parameters ) , satisfying the restrictions stated in section  [ parameters ] , there exists a normalized nevanlinna function with this line complex and these asymptotic values , and it is unique up to an affine change of the independent variable .",
    "the schwarzian derivative of this function is a polynomial and we compose with an affine change of the independent variable so that this polynomial has leading coefficient @xmath125 and next coefficient vanishing , so that @xmath126 in this paper , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and nevanlinna parameters are asymptotic values @xmath59 and @xmath58 as described in section  [ parameters ] .",
    "function @xmath41 does not change if @xmath59 and @xmath58 are multiplied by the same number . for a fixed line complex , the map that sends the parameter @xmath129 to the nevanlinna triple @xmath24",

    "it gives a parametrization of a part of the spectral locus .",
    "we label the faces of @xmath118 and @xmath120 with the asymptotic values , so that a face of @xmath120 has the same label as its image .",
    "two cell decompositions @xmath130 and @xmath131 are considered equivalent if one can be mapped onto another by a homeomorphism of the plane preserving orientation and labels of faces and vertices . if two nevanlinna functions @xmath41 and @xmath107 have equivalent cell decompositions , then @xmath132 .    the following properties are evident .",
    "the cyclic order of face labels around a vertex of @xmath120 is the same as for the image vertex in @xmath118 .",
    "two faces of @xmath120 with the same labels have disjoint closures . each face is bounded either by two edges of by infinitely many edges .    by erasing multiple edges of the @xmath123-skeleton of @xmath120 and discarding the labels of bounded faces , we obtain a new cell decomposition with labeled faces and vertices , whose @xmath123-skeleton is a tree .",
    "the line complex can be uniquely recovered from its associated tree .",
    "if @xmath41 is real , so asymptotic values are symmetric with respect to complex conjugation , sometimes it is possible to choose a symmetric cell decomposition @xmath118 . then @xmath120 is also symmetric . and",
    "conversely : if the labeled cell decompositions @xmath118 and @xmath120 are symmetric with respect to complex conjugation then @xmath41 can be chosen real by pre - composing with an affine map of @xmath42 .",
    "line complexes are convenient for study of the limits of families of nevanlinna functions when two asymptotic values collide .",
    "we have the following compactness theorem @xcite .",

    "suppose that @xmath135 is a vertex of @xmath136 , and that @xmath133 are normalized by conditions @xmath137 .",
    "then one can choose a subsequence from @xmath133 that tends to a limit , and this limit is a nevanlinna function .",
    "we need only the special case when the cell decompositions @xmath136 corresponding to @xmath133 are all equivalent . if distinct asymptotic values of @xmath133 tend to distinct limits , then @xmath41 has the same cell decomposition @xmath120 . if two asymptotic values of @xmath133 which are labeling adjacent faces of @xmath118 , collide in the limit , then one has to erase from the @xmath123-skeleton of @xmath120 all edges on the common boundaries of faces with these collided asymptotic values .",
    "the component of the remaining graph containing the vertex @xmath138 is the cell decomposition of the limit function .",
    "now we return to nevanlinna functions corresponding to problem ( [ oper ] ) .",
    "one technical problem we are facing is that it is not always possible to choose a symmetric @xmath118 .",

    "we begin with the simplest case when @xmath21 . in this case",
    "the nevanlinna function has an additional symmetry .",
    "the cell decompositions considered in @xcite are _ different _ from line complexes , because in the situation considered in that paper , it is impossible to define a line complex with the required symmetry properties .",

    "function @xmath141 satisfies the differential equation in ( [ oper ] ) with @xmath21 , but does not satisfy the boundary conditions .",

    "_ it is sufficient to prove the lemma for curves in the open half - plane @xmath22 .",
    "the general case follows by continuity .",
    "for @xmath208 all eigenvalues are real and distinct , so we can order them as @xmath209 then each @xmath169 can be analytically continued along @xmath206 for @xmath210 for some @xmath211 .",
    "we denote these analytic continuations by @xmath212 . according to theorems of shin @xcite all but finitely many of the @xmath169 are real and by ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) , all but finitely many @xmath169 can be analytically continued for @xmath213 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath214 be a bounded simply connected neighborhood of @xmath206 in the half - plane @xmath215 . then all but finitely many branches of @xmath216 are holomorphic , distinct and real in @xmath214 .",
    "the remaining branches satisfy a minimal algebraic equation of the form @xmath217 with @xmath218 analytic in @xmath214 .",
    "the zeros of the discriminant of this equation in @xmath214 form a closed subset @xmath219 .",
    "we claim that all solutions of equation ( [ eq ] ) are distinct for all @xmath220 . indeed ,",
    "if any two eigenvalues collide as @xmath221 increases , then some adjacent eigenvalues @xmath222 and @xmath223 must collide at some point @xmath224 .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions will tend to the same limit as @xmath225 .",
    "but this is impossible because one of them has no real zeros and another has one .",
    "thus @xmath226 does not intersect @xmath206 , and there is an analytic continuation of eigenfunctions to @xmath227 .",
    "in this section we consider the general case of real asymptotic values @xmath59 and @xmath58 . in this case",
    "the normalized nevanlinna function @xmath41 has asymptotic values @xmath228 in @xmath197 .",
    "we choose the cell decomposition @xmath118 similar to that in fig .  1",
    ", see figs .  5,7,9 .",
    "there are three generic cases : @xmath229 letters @xmath230 and @xmath231 stand for `` left '' , `` right '' and `` even '' , the meaning of this notation will be clear later ( figs .  11 - 15 ) .",
    "there are also non - generic cases @xmath73 and @xmath110 . assuming that @xmath202",
    ", we classify all possible line complexes .    in all cases @xmath232 and @xmath231 , we first classify all possible bipartite trees symmetric with respect to the real line , with @xmath50 faces labeled by @xmath233 in this cyclic order , the face labeled @xmath56 bisected by the positive ray , and satisfying the condition that faces with the same label have disjoint closures .",
    "there are three types of such trees shown in fig .",
    "they depend on two integer parameters , @xmath234 and @xmath8 , where @xmath157 is the number of edges between two ramified vertices as shown in fig .",
    "parameter @xmath8 takes all integer values , but @xmath235 is the number of edges between ramified vertices as indicated in fig .  4 .",
    "we say that a tree has type @xmath53 if @xmath236 , type @xmath123 if @xmath237 and type @xmath238 if @xmath239 .",
    "now we consider all cases separately , and argue by the following scheme .",
    "first , for a given case of ordering @xmath241 on the real line , and for each tree , we decide whether this tree can come from a line complex , and if it can , we recover the line complex .    to do this , we begin with a ramified vertex @xmath138 of the tree . comparing the cyclic order of the labels around this vertex @xmath138 with the cyclic order around the vertices of the cell decomposition @xmath118 of the sphere we determine whether this vertex of the tree is a @xmath121 or @xmath122 , and add the missing edges , step by step .",
    "when we come to another ramified vertex , either the cyclic order is correct or not .",
    "if it is not correct , the tree does not correspond to a line complex in the considered case .",
    "otherwise , we recover the line complex uniquely .",
    "then we consider possible limits as @xmath243 or @xmath244 on the spectral locus .",
    "this gives degenerations to the intersections of the qes spectral locus with the non - qes spectral locus , and description of these intersections in @xcite permits to recover the value of @xmath1 from the tree in cases 1 and 2 .",
    "then we consider the degeneration as @xmath244 or @xmath245 whenever possible , as it was done in @xcite .",
    "we will conclude that real values of @xmath58 correspond to integer @xmath1 and we obtain the parametrization of the whole spectral locus for integer @xmath1 .",
    "trees @xmath249 of type @xmath123 ( with @xmath237 ) are possible in this case if and only if @xmath250 and @xmath251 is odd .",
    "such line complexes will be called @xmath248 . when @xmath252 , @xmath253 , the corresponding nevanlinna function has a limit on the qes locus .",
    "this limit function has @xmath254 zeros , none of them real .",
    "it follows that @xmath255 for the limit function . by the first part of theorem 2 which we proved in section [ darboux ] ,",
    "@xmath58 is real for integer @xmath1 on the non - qes part of the spectral locus , so we conclude that the whole image of the nevanlinna map @xmath256 belongs to @xmath257 with @xmath255 .",
    "trees of type @xmath238 ( with @xmath239 ) are possible in this case if and only if @xmath159 and @xmath260 is odd .",
    "such line complexes will be called @xmath248 .",
    "the only possible limit on the spectral locus is @xmath261 .",
    "this corresponds to an elementary _ second _ solution of the differential equation in ( [ oper ] ) ( solution which is linearly independent of the eigenfunction ) .",
    "these points are marked in fig .",
    "thus the chart @xmath248 , @xmath260 corresponds to the chart @xmath262 via darboux transform .",
    "we have @xmath263 in this case .",
    "trees @xmath249 of the type @xmath123 ( with @xmath237 ) are possible with @xmath159 and @xmath8 positive odd .",
    "we call the complex @xmath266 . degeneration @xmath243 , @xmath267 is possible , and the limit belongs to the qes spectral locus .",
    "the limit nevanlinna function has @xmath254 zeros , so @xmath255 for this limit function .",
    "again , using the first part of theorem 2 , we conclude that @xmath255 on the whole image of the nevanlinna map @xmath268 degeneration @xmath269 ( that is @xmath270 ) gives a nevanlinna function for the harmonic oscillator with @xmath271 zeros .",
    "as @xmath248 and @xmath266 have common limit of the qes spectral locus , their nevanlinna images form a single curve .",
    "the results in @xcite about qes spectral locus together with counting of zeros of degeneration to harmonic oscillator show that @xmath248 lies on the left and @xmath266 lies on the right from the intersection point with the qes spectral locus .",
    "see figs .",
    "11 , 13 , where nevanlinna images of @xmath248 and @xmath266 are shown with the solid lines , and the qes locus with the dotted line .",
    "trees @xmath249 of type @xmath238 ( with @xmath239 ) give line complexes when @xmath159 and @xmath8 negative odd .",
    "we call these complexes @xmath266 .",
    "degeneration @xmath244 is possible on the spectral locus .",
    "these charts correspond to the charts @xmath272 by darboux transform .",
    "thus cases @xmath246 and @xmath264 and trees of types 1 and 2 cover all cases when @xmath1 is odd .",
    "we conclude from this : a ) @xmath1 is constant on the nevanlinna images of @xmath248 and @xmath266 , namely @xmath255 .",
    "b ) even values of @xmath1 must be covered by the remaining trees from our classification .",
    "trees @xmath275 of type @xmath53 have parameter @xmath276 , and we denote the corresponding line complex by @xmath277",
    ". this line complex represents nevanlinna functions from section [ j=0 ] which correspond to @xmath21 .",
    "trees @xmath249 of type @xmath238 have @xmath159 and @xmath8 negative even .",
    "we call the corresponding line complex @xmath274 .",
    "no degeneration on the spectral locus is possible . we know that for even @xmath1 the non - qes spectral locus consists of graphs of functions .",
    "degeneration as @xmath278 and @xmath245 gives a nevanlinna function for the harmonic oscillator with @xmath158 zeros .",
    "thus these trees parametrize the whole spectrum for negative even @xmath1 .",
    "trees @xmath249 of type @xmath123 have @xmath159 and @xmath8 positive even .",
    "we call the corresponding complex @xmath274 .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath279 by the darboux transform .",
    "degeneration as @xmath278 and @xmath245 gives a nevanlinna function for the harmonic oscillator with @xmath158 and @xmath280 zeros , respectively .",
    "these arguments show that real @xmath58 and @xmath202 correspond to integer @xmath1 and that we obtain a parametrization of the whole non - qes spectral locus in this way .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem 2 .",
    "the parametrization of the spectral locus for integer @xmath1 is represented in figs .",
    "the symbols of line complexes are written below the corresponding curves .",
    "the qes spectral locus is shown with dotted lines .",
    "it was parametrized with different cell decompositions ( not with line complexes ! ) in @xcite .",
    "symbols @xmath249 in the figures refer to the charts on the qes locus described in @xcite",
