    "the presence of boundaries is usually an obstacle to extracting the bulk properties of a system in the thermodynamic limit from analytical or numerical calculations .",
    "since the conventional wisdom is that the thermodynamic properties are not affected by the boundary conditions imposed , the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are often used to suppress the finite - size effect caused by the presence of open edges . in analytical studies , the boundary conditions other than pbc usually spoil the integrability and/or solvability of models . however , in practice , in numerical methods such as the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , the open boundary conditions ( obc ) are more preferable than the pbc , because the calculations under the pbc require some additional computational resources .",
    "there is a way to reduce the effect of boundaries in the dmrg scheme by turning off the interactions smoothly around the edges , which is called smooth boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "similar but modified boundary conditions apply to calculations of transport properties such as the conductance of one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting systems  @xcite .",
    "more recently , another efficient scheme , which is called the sine - square deformation ( ssd ) , has been proposed  @xcite .",

    "as seen from @xmath7 for @xmath8 ( mod @xmath5 ) , the ssd breaks the link between the sites @xmath9 and @xmath5 . in various 1d systems including free - fermion chains  @xcite , quantum spin chains and ladders  @xcite , the hubbard model  @xcite , and kondo - lattice model  @xcite ,",
    "the performance of the ssd has been examined numerically .",
    "it was found for critical systems that the ssd completely suppresses the boundary effects , i.e. , the ground - state expectation values of local observables such as the bond strength are translationally invariant . furthermore , hikihara and nishino revealed that the wave - function overlap between the ground state of an open system with ssd and that of a uniform system with pbc is very close to ( almost exactly ) unity .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that the ground state of a uniform 1d system at criticality remains almost unchanged even if we introduce the ssd that is spatially modulating by the function @xmath10 .",
    "motivated by this , a rigorous proof of the correspondence for the spin-@xmath11 xy chain , which is equivalent to the system of 1d free fermions , was given by the present author  @xcite .",
    "a simpler and more physical explanation for the success of the ssd in free - fermion systems was given  @xcite , which allows us to extend the idea of the ssd from one dimension to two and higher dimensions .",
    "although the efficiency of the ssd has been established for free - fermion systems , the success of the ssd even in systems with strong interactions such as the xxz and hubbard models still remains a puzzle and requires further analysis . in this paper , we reveal the underlying mechanism of the correspondence between the systems with pbc and ssd from the perspective of solvable models and conformal field theories ( cfts ) a central role is played by _",

    "in conclusion , we have investigated solvable spin chains , the massless dirac model , and conformal field theories with ssd . for the isotropic xy and the transverse field ising chains at criticality , the unique ground state of an open chain with ssd is obtained as the ground state of a uniform chain with pbc , i.e. , the ssd leaves the periodic ground state unchanged . for the model of massless dirac fermions , we showed that the hamiltonian for the system with ssd is positive semidefinite , and found that the dirac sea of the uniform system remains an exact ground state .",
    "for generic cfts , we saw how the hamiltonian of a system with ssd is expressed in terms of the @xmath28 subalgebra of the virasoro algebra .",
    "this allowed us to show that the vacuum state , which is invariant under @xmath28 , is an exact eigenstate of the ssd hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , for a certain class of cfts associated with affine lie ( kac - moody ) algebras , it is revealed that the hamiltonian is expressed as a positive semidefinite operator , similar to the case of the massless dirac fermions .",
    "thereby , we showed that the vacuum state is not only an eigenstate but also a ground state of the ssd hamiltonian for this class of cfts , including @xmath3 gaussian model .",
    "although we are not able to prove that there are no further ground states , our findings provide a reasonable explanation for the previous observations in numerical studies that the ssd well suppresses the effect of open boundaries on the ground state properties in a wide class of critical one - dimensional systems .    it should be stressed that the key to understanding the remarkable correspondence observed in all the examples is that the chiral hamiltonians , in terms of which the ssd hamiltonian is expressed , annihilate the ground state of the uniform hamiltonian , i.e. , it is a zero - energy eigenstate of the chiral hamiltonians .",
    "this strongly suggests that the original , chiral , and ssd hamiltonians have further common eigenstates other than the ground state .",
    "in fact , we have some numerical evidence that the uniform and ssd xy chains have common excited eigenstates .",
    "this might be understood from the perspective of the theory of macdonald polynomials , as suggested in previous work  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to ask whether we can obtain some of eigenstates other than the vacuum state or even the whole spectrum of the ssd hamiltonian for a given cft .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the simultaneous eigenstate of @xmath224 and @xmath225 of the virasoro algebra ( the coherent state of @xmath225 ) plays an important role in connection with the relationship between 4-dimensional gauge theory and 2-dimensional cft  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask whether we can diagonalize linear combinations of @xmath224 and @xmath226 , including the ssd hamiltonian for generic cfts .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that conformal mappings relating the ssd and the periodic hamiltonians may not be restricted to the one used in the paper .",
    "different mappings may provide a cft interpretation of other deformations such as the hyperbolic  @xcite , exponential  @xcite , and sinusoidal  @xcite deformations .",
    "the author would like to thank toshiya hikihara , isao maruyama , tomotoshi nishino , and shintarou yanagida for their valuable comments and suggestions .",
    "the author was supported in part by grant - in - aid for young scientists ( b ) ( 23740298 ) .",
    "in this appendix , we extend the lieb - schultz - mattis argument  @xcite to the isotropic xy ( or an equivalent free - fermion ) chain with ssd and find that the lowest excitation energy is @xmath102 . as we will see below ,",
    "the proof does not rely on the translational invariance of the hamiltonian but on that of the ground state . therefore , with a reasonable assumption that the ground state of the ssd hamiltonian is almost exactly translationally invariant as observed in the previous numerical studies , it is plausible that the same argument holds for interacting cases such as the xxz chain .",
    "this implies the gapless excitation in the limit of @xmath103 when the ssd is applicable .",
    "let us consider the spin-@xmath11 isotropic xy chain in a field with ssd : @xmath227 where @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath228 . since @xmath229 commutes with @xmath27 , @xmath27 is block - diagonal in the eigenvalue @xmath230 of @xmath229 .",
    "it follows from the perron - frobenius theorem that the ground state in each @xmath230 sector is unique .",
    "we now prove that the lowest excitation energy is @xmath102 in each @xmath230 sector . to show this , we follow @xcite and introduce the twist operator @xmath231 and construct a trial state as @xmath232 , where @xmath114 denotes the ground state of the sector with fixed @xmath230 . a straightforward calculation yields @xmath233 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\ ] ] where @xmath69 .",
    "although the second term would appear to give @xmath234 contribution , @xmath235 { \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle}=0 $ ] for any eigenstate of @xmath27 and hence @xmath236 this implies the existence of gapless excitations in the limit @xmath103 if the trial state is orthogonal to @xmath114 .",
    "it should be noted that our proof does not rely on any symmetry of @xmath27 .",
    "we can , therefore , apply the above argument to a large class of deformed models in which the function @xmath237 is @xmath234 .",
    "the above argument also applies to the interacting cases with the @xmath238 coupling since it commutes with @xmath239 .",
    "let us next show the orthogonality @xmath240 and thus that the estimate ( [ eq : exc_eng ] ) gives an upper bound on the excitation energy . to this end , we make use of the translational invariance of the ground state @xmath114 that is a direct consequence of the result shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and sec .",
    "[ sec : lattice ] of the present paper .",
    "let @xmath241 be the translation operator by one site .",
    "then , from the translational invariance of @xmath114 and the fact that @xmath242 , we have @xmath243 therefore , the orthogonality @xmath240 holds except for @xmath244 , i.e. , the fully polarized cases .",
    "in this appendix , we show that the hamiltonian with ssd can be expressed in terms of fermionic generators in superconformal field theories ( scft ) .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath245 superconformal algebra .",
    "an example of the lattice model whose continuum limit falls into this class is the tricritical ising model with the central charge @xmath246 .",
    "the algebra of @xmath245 scft contains fermionic generators besides the virasoro ones and is defined by the following commutation and anti - commutation relations  @xcite : @xmath247 where @xmath248 while @xmath249 are either half - integer indices ( neveu - schwarz sector ) or else are integer indices ( the ramond sector ) . @xmath250",
    "have the meaning of the fourier components of the field @xmath251 with the conformal dimension @xmath252 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1scft_3 ] ) , one easily finds @xmath253 in the neveu - schwarz sector while @xmath254 for the ramond sector . since @xmath255 is positive semi - definite and @xmath256 for @xmath257 , the vacuum @xmath65 can not be in the ramond sector for unitary cfts .",
    "note that we required @xmath258 .",
    "let us first focus on the ssd hamiltonian for the neveu - schwarz sector .",
    "similarly , using eq .",
    "( [ eq:1scft_3 ] ) , we find that the hamiltonian @xmath185 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cft_l_ham ] ) is expressed as @xmath259 this immediately implies that the eigenvalues of @xmath185 is nonnegative .",
    "we have similar expressions for the right - moving part of the hamiltonian ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "therefore , the ground state energy of the ssd hamiltonian is bounded below by @xmath260 and @xmath65 is an exact ground state in the neveu - schwarz sector , which is consistent with what we found for the cfts associated with affine lie algebras in sec .",
    "4 . for the ramond sector",
    ", we have @xmath261    let us next examine the @xmath262 scft .",
    "it has been shown that the continuum field theory describing the supersymmetric quantum critical lattice models has this symmetry  @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison of the lattice model and @xmath262 scft is presented in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath262 superconformal algebra contains two fermionic fields @xmath263 with the conformal dimension @xmath252 and a u(1 ) current @xmath264 with the dimension @xmath9 , and is defined by the following relations .",
    "@xmath265 where @xmath248 .",
    "similar to the @xmath245 scft , @xmath266 in the neveu - schwarz sector and @xmath267 in the ramond sector .",
    "note that hermitian conjugation of @xmath268 is defined by @xmath269 . from the fact that the operators @xmath270 generate the algebra isomorphic to @xmath245 superconformal algebra , we find that the ssd hamiltonian in the neveu - schwarz sector is expressed as @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the supercharge satisfying @xmath273 .",
    "one can explicitly confirm the above relation using eq .",
    "( [ eq:2scft_6 ] ) .",
    "it is now apparent that @xmath185 in the neveu - schwarz sector is written as the anti - commutator of the supercharges as usual in the supersymmetric quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "nice corollaries of this result are as follows : i ) all the eigenvalues of @xmath185 are nonnegative , ii ) states with a positive energy come in pairs , iii ) any state with zero energy is a ground state and is annihilated by both @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the original uniform theory ( @xmath25 ) , this supersymmetric structure is realized not in the neveu - schwarz sector but in the ramond sector @xcite .",
    "let us finally consider the ssd hamiltonian for the ramond sector . again using the isomorphism",
