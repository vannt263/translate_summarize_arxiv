    "star formation shapes the observable properties of galaxies but involves a variety of complicated dynamical , thermal , radiative , and chemical processes on a wide range of scales ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "observed galaxies exhibit large - scale correlations between their global star formation rate ( sfr ) surface density @xmath9 and average gas surface density @xmath10 @xcite , and these global correlations serve as the basis for treatments of star formation in many models of galaxy formation . while such models have supplied important insights , detailed observations of galaxies have recently provided evidence that the molecular , rather than the total , gas surface density is the primary driver of global star formation in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we adopt an approach in which empirical and theoretical knowledge of the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) in dense , molecular gas is used as the basis for a star formation model in hydrodynamical simulations of disk galaxy evolution .",
    "this approach requires modeling processes that shape properties of the dense phase of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present such a model .",
    "stellar populations in galaxies exhibit salient trends of colors and metallicities with galaxy luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the hierarchical structure formation scenario these trends should emerge through the processes of star formation and/or stellar feedback in the progenitors of present - day galaxies .",
    "observationally , ample evidence suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of gas into stars depends strongly and non - monotonically on mass of the system .",
    "for example , the faint - end of the galaxy luminosity function has a shallow slope ( @xmath11 , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) compared to the steeper mass function of dark matter halos ( @xmath12 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating a decrease in sfe in low - mass galaxies .",
    "at the same time , the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) and baryonic mass functions may be steeper than the luminosity function ( @xmath13 , e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the baryonic @xcite relation is continuous down to extremely low - mass dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that the fractional baryonic content of galaxies of different mass is similar .",
    "hence , low - mass galaxies that are unaffected by environmental processes are gas - rich , yet often form stars inefficiently .    while feedback processes from supernovae and agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the efficiency of gas cooling and accretion @xcite , may account for part of these trends , the sfe as a function of galaxy mass may also owe to intrinsic ism processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . to adequately explore the latter possibility , a realistic model for the conversion of gas into stars in galaxies is needed .",
    "traditionally , star formation in numerical simulations of galaxy formation is based on the empirical schmidt - kennicutt ( sk ) relation @xcite , in which star formation rate is a _",
    "universal _ power - law function of the total disk - averaged or global gas surface density : @xmath4 with @xmath14 describing the correlation for the entire population of normal and starburst galaxies .",
    "however , growing observational evidence indicates that this relation may not be universal on smaller scales within galaxies , especially at low surface densities .",
    "estimates of the slope of the sk relation within individual galaxies exhibits significant variations .",
    "for example , while @xcite and @xcite find @xmath14 for the molecular - rich galaxy m51a , similar estimates in other large , nearby galaxies ( including the milky way ( mw ) ;",
    "* ) range from @xmath15 to @xmath16 @xcite depending on dust - corrections and fitting methods .",
    "the disk - averaged total gas sk relation for normal ( non - starburst ) galaxies also has a comparably steep slope of @xmath17 , with significant scatter @xcite . while the variations in the @xmath18 correlation may indicate systematic uncertainties in observational measurements , intrinsic variations or trends in galaxy properties",
    "may also induce differences between the global relation determined by @xcite and the @xmath18 correlation in individual galaxies .",
    "galaxies with low gas surface densities , like dwarfs or bulgeless spirals , display an even wider variation in their star formation relations .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that in low - mass galaxies the sfr dependence on the total gas surface density exhibits a power - law slope @xmath19 that is considerably steeper than the global @xcite relation slope of @xmath14 .",
    "further , star formation in the low - surface density outskirts of galaxies also may not be universal .",
    "average sfrs appear to drop rapidly at gas surface densities of @xmath20 @xcite , indicating that star formation may be truncated or exhibit a steep dependence on the gas surface density .",
    "the existence of such threshold surface densities have been proposed on theoretical grounds @xcite , although recent galex results using a uv indicator of star formation suggest that star formation may continue at even lower surface densities @xcite .",
    "star formation rates probed by damped lyman alpha absorption ( dla ) systems also appear to lie below the @xcite relation , by an order of magnitude @xcite , which may indicate that the relation between sfr and gas surface density in dla systems differs from the local relation measured at high @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , observations generally show that star formation in galaxies correlates strongly with _",
    "gas , especially with the highly dense gas traced by hcn emission @xcite .",
    "the power - law index of the sk relation connecting the sfr to the surface density of molecular hydrogen consistently displays a value of @xmath3 and exhibits considerably less galaxy - to - galaxy variation @xcite .",
    "molecular gas , in turn , is expected to form in the high - pressure regions of the ism @xcite , as indicated by observations @xcite .",
    "analytical models and numerical simulations that tie star formation to the fraction of gas in the dense ism are successful in reproducing many observational trends ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "recently , several studies have explored star formation recipes based on molecular hydrogen . @xcite and @xcite implemented models for @xmath1 formation in gaseous disks and used them to study the molecular content and star formation in galaxies .",
    "however , these studies focused on the evolution of galaxies of a single mass and did not address the origin of the sk relation , its dependence on galaxy mass or structure , or its connection to trends in the local molecular fraction .",
    "our study examines the sk relation critically , including its dependence on the structural and ism properties of galaxies of different masses , to explain the observed deviations from the global sk relation , to investigate other connections between star formation and disk galaxy properties such as rotation or gravitational instability , and to explore how the temperature and density structure of the ism pertains to the star formation attributes of galaxies .    to these ends ,",
    "we develop a model for the ism and star formation whose key premise is that star formation on the scales of molecular clouds ( @xmath21  pc ) is a function of molecular hydrogen density with a universal sfe per free - fall time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". molecular hydrogen , which we assume to be a proxy for dense , star forming gas , is accounted for by calculating the local @xmath1 fraction of gas as a function of density , temperature , and metallicity using the photoionization code cloudy @xcite to incorporate @xmath1-destruction by the uv radiation of local young stellar populations .",
    "we devise a numerical implementation of the star formation and ism model , and perform hydrodynamical simulations to study the role of molecular gas in shaping global star formation relations of self - consistent galaxy models over a representative mass range .    the results of our study show that many of the observed global star formation correlations and trends can be understood in terms of the dependence of molecular hydrogen abundance on the local gas volume density .",
    "we show that the physics controlling the abundance of molecular hydrogen and its destruction by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) play a key role in shaping these correlations , in agreement with earlier calculations based on more idealized models of the ism @xcite . while our simulations focus on the connection between the molecular ism phase and star formation on galactic scales , the formation of molecular hydrogen has also been recently studied in simulations of the ism on smaller , subgalactic scales @xcite .",

    "to examine molecular gas and star formation in disk galaxies , we develop a model that accounts for low temperature coolants ( @xmath23 ) , calculates the equilibrium abundance of @xmath1 in dense gas , and estimates the local sfr based on the local @xmath1 density with a universal sfe per free fall time .",

    "results presented in the previous sections indicate that star formation prescriptions based on the local abundance of molecular hydrogen lead to interesting features of the global star formation relations .    we show that the inclusion of an interstellar radiation field is critical to control the amount of diffuse @xmath1 at low gas densities .",
    "for instance , without a dissociating isrf the low mass dwarf galaxy eventually becomes almost fully molecular , in stark contrast with observations .",

    "this relation is non - trivial because the molecular fraction is controlled by pressure and isrf strength , and can thus vary between different regions with the same total gas surface density . the relation can also be different in the regions where the disk scale - height changes rapidly ( e.g. , in flaring outer regions of disks ) , as can be seen from equation  [ equation : structural_schmidt_law ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we show that the effect of radial variations in the molecular fraction @xmath8 and gas scale heights ( @xmath359 and @xmath234 ) on the sfr can be accounted for in terms of a structural , sk - like correlation , @xmath360 , that trivially relates the local sfr to the consumption of molecular gas with an efficiency that scales with the local dynamical time .",

    "while our simulations of an m33 analogue produce a steep sk power - law , the overall sfe in our model galaxies lies below that observed for m33 .",
    "however , as recently emphasized by @xcite , the highest surface density regions of m33 have unusually efficient star formation compared with the normalization of the @xcite relation and so the discrepancy is not surprising . given that dwarf galaxies generally have low surface densities and are poor in molecular gas , it will be interesting to examine sk relation in other small - mass galaxies .",
    "another example of a low - molecular fraction galaxy close to home is m31 , which has only a fraction @xmath363 of its gas in molecular form within 18 kpc of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "our model would predict that this galaxy should deviate from the total gas sk relation found for molecular - rich galaxies .",
    "observationally , the sk relation of m31 measured by @xcite is rather complicated and even has an increasing sfr with decreasing gas density over parts of the galaxy .",
    "low molecular fractions can also be expected in the outskirts of normal galaxies and in the disks of low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the latter have molecular fractions of only @xmath364 @xcite , and we therefore predict that they will not follow the total gas sk relation obeyed by molecule - rich , higher surface density galaxies . at the same time , lsbs do lie on the same relation between @xmath1 mass and far infrared luminosity as higher surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies @xcite , which suggests that the dependence of star formation on molecular gas may be the same in both types of galaxies .",
    "an alternative formulation of the global star formation relation is based on the angular frequency of disk rotation : @xmath365 .",
    "that this relation works in real galaxies is not trivial , because star formation and dynamical time - scale depend on the local gas density , while @xmath281 depends on the total mass distribution _ within _ a given radius .",

    "our simulations further demonstrate the importance of accounting for all mass components in the disk to predict correctly which regions galactic disks are gravitationally unstable .",
    "given that our star formation prescription is based on molecular hydrogen , the fact that @xmath371 is a good threshold indicator may imply that gravitational instabilities strongly influence the abundance of dense , molecular gas in the disk .",

    "we find that in our model galaxies , the shear instability criterion of @xcite does not work as well as the toomre @xmath371-based criterion .",
    "almost all of the star formation in our model galaxies occurs at surface densities @xmath372 , which is formally consistent with the @xcite constant surface density criterion for gravithermal instability .",
    "however , as figure  [ fig : kennicutt.gas ] shows , we do not see a clear indication of threshold at a particular surface density and our gd - sf models that have an effectively isothermal ism with @xmath340 ( and hence do not have a gravithermal instability ) still show a good correlation between regions where @xmath373 and regions where star formation operates .",

    "first , low molecular fractions in dwarf galaxies mean that only a small fraction of gas is participating in star formation at any given time .",
    "this connection between sfe and molecular hydrogen abundance may explain why dwarf galaxies are still gas rich today compared to larger mass galaxies @xcite , without relying on mediation of star formation or gas blowout by supernovae . note that a similar reasoning may also explain why large lsbs at low redshifts are gas rich but anemic in their star formation .",
    "understanding the star formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies is critical because they serve as the building blocks of larger galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "such small - mass galaxies are also expected to be the first objects to form large masses of stars and should therefore play an important role in enrichment of primordial gas and the cosmic star formation rate at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the star - forming disks at @xmath374 that may be progenitors of low - redshift spiral galaxies are observed to lack centrally - concentrated bulge components @xcite . given that galaxies are expected to undergo frequent mergers at @xmath375 ,",
    "bulges should have formed if a significant fraction of baryons are converted into stars during such mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the absence of the bulge may indicate that star formation in the gas rich progenitors of these @xmath376 systems was too slow to convert a significant fraction of gas into stars .",
    "this low sfe can be understood if the high cosmic uv background , low - metallicities , and low dust content of high-@xmath377 gas disks keep their molecular fractions low @xcite , thereby inhibiting star formation over most of gas mass and keeping the progenitors of the star - forming @xmath376 disks mostly gaseous .",
    "gas - rich progenitors may also help explain the prevalence of extended disks in low - redshift galaxies despite the violent early merger histories characteristic of @xmath26cdm universes , as gas - rich mergers can help build high - angular momentum disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "mergers of mostly stellar disks , on the other hand , would form spheroidal systems .",
    "our results may also provide insight into the interpretation of the results of @xcite , who find that the sfr associated with neutral atomic gas in damped lyman alpha ( dla ) systems is an order of magnitude lower than predicted by the local @xcite relation .",
    "the dlas in their study sample regions with column densities @xmath378 , or surface gas densities of @xmath379 , assuming a gas disk with a thickness of @xmath380  pc .",
    "suppose the local sk relation steepens from the local relation with the slope @xmath381 to a steeper slope @xmath382 below some surface density @xmath383 .",
    "then for @xmath384 , the sfr density will be lower than predicted by the local relation by a factor of @xmath385 .",
    "for @xmath381 and @xmath386 the sfr will be suppressed by a factor of @xmath387 for @xmath388 .",
    "thus , the results @xcite can be explained if the total gas sk relation at @xmath389 steepens below @xmath390 .",
    "we suggest that if the majority of the molecular hydrogen at these redshifts resides in rare , compact , and dense systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then both the lack of star formation and the rarity of molecular hydrogen in damped ly@xmath264 absorbers may be explained simultaneously .",
    "our results also indicate that the thermodynamics of the ism can leave an important imprint on its density probability distribution . each thermal phase in our model galaxies has its own log - normal density distribution .",
    "our results thus imply that using a single lognormal pdf to build a model of global star formation in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is likely an oversimplification . instead",
    ", the global star formation relation may vary depending on the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the ism .",
    "we can thus expect differences in the sfe between the low - density and low - metallicity environments of dwarf and high - redshift galaxies and the higher - metallicity , denser gas of many large nearby spirals .",
    "note that many of the results and effects we discuss above may not be reproduced with a simple 3d density threshold for star formation , as commonly implemented in galaxy formation simulations .",
    "such a threshold can reproduce the atomic - to - molecular transition only crudely and would not include effects of the local interstellar radiation field , metallicity and dust content , etc .",
    "a clear caveat for our work is that the simulation resolution limits the densities we can model correctly . at high densities ,",
    "the gas in our simulations is over - pressurized to avoid numerical jeans instability .",
    "the equilibrium density and temperature structure of the ism and the molecular fraction are therefore not correct in detail .",
    "note , however , that our pressurization prescription is designed to scale with the resolution , and should converge to the `` correct '' result as the resolution improves . in any event , the simulations likely do not include all the relevant physics shaping density and temperature pdfs of the ism in real galaxies .",
    "the results may of course depend on other microphysics of the ism as they influence both the temperature pdf and the fraction of gas in a high - density , molecular form .",
    "future simulations of the molecular ism may need to account for new microphysics as they resolve scales where such processes become important .",
    "using hydrodynamical simulations of the ism and star formation in cosmologically motivated disk galaxies over a range of representative masses , we examine the connection between molecular hydrogen abundance and destruction , observed star formation relations , and the thermodynamical structure of the interstellar medium .",
    "our simulations provide a variety of new insights into the mass dependence of star formation efficiency in galaxies .",
    "a summary of our methodology and results follows .    * a model of heating and cooling processes in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , including low - temperature coolants , dust heating and cooling processes , and heating by the cosmic uv background , cosmic rays , and the local interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) ,",
    "is calculated using the photoionization code cloudy @xcite .",
    "calculating the molecular fraction of the ism enables us to implement a prescription for the star formation rate ( sfr ) that ties the sfr directly to the molecular gas density .",
    "the ism and star formation model is implemented in the sph / n - body code gadget2 @xcite and used to simulate the evolution of isolated disk galaxies .",
    "* we study the correlations between gas surface density ( @xmath10 ) , molecular gas surface density ( @xmath289 ) , and sfr surface density ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we find that in our most realistic model that includes heating and destruction of @xmath1 by the interstellar radiation field , the power law index of the sk relation , @xmath391 , ( measured in annuli ) varies from @xmath5 in massive galaxies to @xmath6 in small mass dwarfs .",
    "the corresponding slope of the @xmath392 molecular - gas schmidt - kennicutt relation is approximately the same for all galaxies , with @xmath393 .",
    "these results are consistent with observations of star formation in different galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the different @xmath18 relations in galaxies of different mass and in regions of different surface density in our models therefore owe to the dependence of molecular fraction @xmath8 and scale height of gas on the gas surface density . *",
    "we show that the @xmath304 and @xmath369 correlations describe the simulations results well where the molecular gas and total gas densities are comparable , while the simulations deviate from @xmath304 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at low @xmath10 owing to a declining molecular fraction .",
    "we demonstrate that these relations may owe to the fact that the angular frequency and the disk - plane gas density are generally related as @xmath286 for exponential disks if the potential is dominated by either the disk , a @xcite halo , @xcite halo , or an isothermal sphere .",
    "the correlation of @xmath9 with @xmath281 is thus a secondary correlation in the sense that @xmath286 is set during galaxy formation and @xmath281 does not directly influence star formation . *",
    "the role of critical surface densities for shear instabilities ( @xmath396 ) and @xcite instabilities ( @xmath397 ) in star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is examined in the context of the presented simulations .",
    "we find that the two - component toomre instability criterion @xmath373 is an accurate indicator of the star - forming regions of disks , and that gravitational instability and star formation are closely related in our simulations .",
    "further , the @xmath325 criterion works even in simulations in which cooling is restricted to @xmath175  k where gravithermal instability can not operate . * our simulations that include @xmath1-destruction by an isrf",

    "* ) , but we find that simulations without an isrf have a weaker scaling @xmath399 .",

    "we present a method for mitigating numerical jeans fragmentation in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations that uses a density - dependent pressurization of gas on small scales to ensure that the jeans mass is properly resolved , similar to techniques used in grid - based simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we also demonstrate that isothermal galactic disks with temperatures of @xmath24 may be susceptible to numerical jeans instabilities at resolutions common in cosmological simulations of disk galaxy formation , and connect this numerical effect to possible angular momentum deficiencies in cosmologically simulated disk galaxies .",

    "the quantity @xmath524 closely tracks @xmath525 throughout the disk , demonstrating that deviations from the @xmath303 correlation are typically @xmath526 .",
    "hence , the @xmath514 relation may be understood in terms of the scaling of the local density in exponential disks with the angular frequency of realistic galaxy potentials , rather than some more fundamental relation connecting star formation processes in the ism with global disk properties .",
    "regions of galaxies with large molecular gas fractions ( @xmath527 ) are then expected to follow the @xmath514 relation , as demonstrated by our simulations ( see  [ section : results : sfr_rotation ] ) .",
    "we note that while a different normalization would reduce the typical deviation from the @xmath525 scaling , the high - density portion of the relation corresponding to the region where the rotation curve is rapidly increasing should produce a shallower relation than @xmath528 .",
    "weak evidence for this may exist in the available data ( e.g. , the inner - disk region of figure 9 of * ? ? ? * ) ."
