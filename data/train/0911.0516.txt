    "the study of nuclear matter properties at high densities and temperatures is one of the main objectives in relativistic heavy - ion physics . in this context",
    ", the paramount aim of measuring the particle yields emitted from heavy - ion collisions is to learn about the k - n potential , production mechanism of strange particles or the nuclear equation of state .",
    "strangeness production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at sis / bevelac energy range has been extensively studied by various groups including experiments at the bevelac@xcite and at sis , kaos@xcite , fopi@xcite , and in recent years also hades .",
    "+ recently , the hades@xcite collaboration measured charged particle production in the ar+kcl system@xcite at 1.756 agev .",
    "although hades was designed primarily for di - electron measurements , it has also shown an excellent capability for the identification of a wide range of hadrons like @xmath0 , @xmath1 , k@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 , @xmath5@xmath3p@xmath6 , @xmath7@xmath3@xmath8@xmath9@xmath8@xmath10 and even @xmath11@xmath3@xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "the measured yields and slopes of the transverse mass of kaons and @xmath5 particles have been found to be in good agreement with the results obtained by kaos@xcite and fopi@xcite .",
    "the dependencies of the measured @xmath12 ratio on the centrality and on the collision energy follow the systematics measured by kaos @xcite too . + a combined and inclusive identification of @xmath13 and @xmath7 mesons was performed for the first time in the same experimental setup at subthreshold beam energy for @xmath0 and @xmath7 production . the obtained @xmath14 ratio of 0.37@xmath150.13@xmath16 indicates that 18@xmath157@xmath16 of kaons stem from @xmath7 decays . since the @xmath7 mesons reconstructed via @xmath13 channel",
    "are those coming mainly from decays happening outside the nuclear medium , this value should be considered as a lower limit .",
    "in addition the non - resonant @xmath13 production can contribute to the measured @xmath0 yield .",
    "unfortunately , this part is not known in heavy - ion collisions , but it has been measured to be about 50@xmath16 of the overall @xmath13 yield in elementary p+p collisions@xcite . in this view , the @xmath0 production in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies can not be explained exclusively by the strangeness exchange mechanism and the processes mentioned above must also be taken into account to achieve a complete description .",
    "the yields of reconstructed hadron species have been extrapolated to the full solid angle and compared to the result from a fit with the statistical model thermus@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermus ] .",
    "the measured yields nicely agree with the results of the model , except for the @xmath17 .",
    "one should note that in this approach a good description of the @xmath7 meson yield is obtained without assuming any strangeness suppression ( net strangeness content of the @xmath7 is s=0 ) .",
    "this is very different as compared to higher energies where @xmath7 meson does not behave as a strangeness neutral object but rather as an object with net strangeness between 1 and 2 @xcite .",
    "+        the @xmath17 baryon yields measured in heavy - ion collisions above the production threshold at rhic@xcite , sps@xcite and ags@xcite nicely agree with the statistical model predictions . on the contrary",
    "the result of the first @xmath17 measurement below the production threshold published by hades@xcite , shows a deviation of about an order of magnitude from the calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thermus ] ) . using the measured hadron multiplicities",
    "the statistical model predicts that the chemical freeze - out of the ar+kcl collision at 1.765 agev occurs at a temperature of t=73@xmath156mev and at chemical baryon potential of @xmath18=770@xmath1543mev .",
    "the strangeness correlation radius@xcite of r@xmath192.4@xmath150.8fm was used which is significantly smaller than the radius of fireball r@xmath20=4.9@xmath151.4fm . +",
    "this result nicely follows the striking regularity shown by particle yields at all beam energies @xcite , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : statmodel ] . for all available energies , starting from the highest at rhic down to the lowest at sis ,",
    "the measured particle multiplicities are consistent with the assumption of chemical equilibrium which sets in at the end of the collision phase .",
    "only two parameters ( the temperature and baryon chemical potential ) are needed within a thermal - statistical model to describe particle yields in a very systematic way at a given collision energy @xcite",
    ". as one can also see , all experimental results are in good agreement with a fixed - energy - per - particle condition @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 , which is one of the available freeze - out criteria@xcite .",
    "the new hades results on strangeness production shed new light on the understanding of kaon production mechanisms in hi collisions , namely the results have provided compelling evidence that the contribution from the @xmath7 decay to the @xmath0 yield has to be also taken into account .",
    "the measured hadron yields have been found in general to be in good agreement with statistical model predictions , besides the @xmath17 , which is produced far below the production threshold and shows a considerable deviation from the statistical model .",
    "the already performed experiments p+p at 3.5 gev and p+nb at 3.5 gev and further planned hades experiments with heavier systems , like au+au will deliver new valuable data on strangeness production . the on - going upgrade of the hades spectrometer will increase its performance and capability and the installed forward wall detector will allow for reaction plane reconstruction in all upcoming runs , allowing to study kaon flow observables as well .",
