    "using @xmath76 in the range -0.4 to 0 , we find that the iterative method converges to the qs distribution slightly faster than the direct approach ( it typically requires about 30% fewer steps ) .",
    "in contrast with the continuous - time case , in which the iterative method can be orders of magnitude faster than integration of the master equation @xcite , here the gain in efficiency is quite modest .",
    "this is not surprising , since the enormous gain in efficiency for continuous - time processes is associated with the small time step required to maintain numerical stability , in the usual direct integration schemes . in the present case , the direct method has an effective time step of unity .",
