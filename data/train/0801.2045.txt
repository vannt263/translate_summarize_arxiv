    "tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 belong to a group of compounds which undergo a structural phase transition induced by the cooperative jahn - teller effect . both tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 exhibit a transition from the tetragonal _ _ i__4@xmath6/_amd _ structure at high temperatures to the twinned orthorhombic _ fddd _ phase at temperatures below 35 k@xcite . at room temperature the low - lying crystal electric field levels for the tb@xmath7 ions in the tbvo@xmath8 environment consist of two singlets separated by",
    "2.23 mev and a degenerate , non - kramers doublet midway between the singlets@xcite .",
    "the jahn - teller phase transition changes the local tb@xmath7 environment , with a concomitant splitting of the doublet , and increase of the singlet separation to 6.32 mev@xcite .",
    "the resulting magnetic ground state for the tb@xmath7 ions can then order magnetically at much lower temperatures@xcite .",
    "the structural phase transitions have also been studied in disordered systems wherein the non - magnetic cations are mixed .",
    "such disordered materials as tbv@xmath0as@xmath9o@xmath8 are characterized by the presence of quenched random strains introduced by the ionic radius mismatch between v@xmath10 and as@xmath10 , which is quite large @xmath11 20@xmath12 .",
    "these materials and their jahn - teller phase transitions have been known and studied for some time .",
    "for example , optical birefrigence studies of the critical properties of tbvo@xmath8 and dyvo@xmath8 showed that the former displayed mean field criticality near its jahn - teller transition , while the latter displayed 3d ising - like universality near its transition@xcite .",
    "early x - ray experiments measured the order parameter relevant to these jahn - teller transitions , the orthorhombic strain , but were not able to give accurate critical property measurements for this family of terbium oxides@xcite .",
    "an x - ray scattering study of the related tbv@xmath0p@xmath9o@xmath8 system@xcite has been carried out , although again , the emphasis was not on the critical regime .",
    "the role of quenched disorder on the jahn - teller phase transitions in the tbv@xmath0as@xmath9o@xmath8 system has more recently been the subject of further optical birefrigence studies , which also show changes in criticality induced by the presence of impurities@xcite .",
    "the change in criticality has been discussed in the context of the random field ising model@xcite and how it may be realized in a structural analogue of the more - familiar case arising in magnetism - that of the dilute ising antiferromagnet in the presence of a uniform magnetic field@xcite .",
    "we have carried out a high resolution x - ray scattering study of the tetragonal to orthorhombic jahn - teller phase transitions in the tbv@xmath13as@xmath9o@xmath8 system , with particular emphasis on the critical regime , where the orthorhombic strain is small and fluctuations in the strain may be expected to be large .",
    "this will enable a quantitative microscopic understanding of the critical phenomena in the pure , end members of the family , and show the extent to which the critical behaviour in the mixed system is modified by the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "single crystals of tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 and their solid solutions were grown from pbo / pbf@xmath14 flux by the slow cooling method .",
    "pre - annealed starting materials tb@xmath14o@xmath15 and x@xmath14o@xmath16 where x is either v or as were weighed and combined with pbo and pbf@xmath14 , which act as high temperature solvents . the mix was then melted in a pt crucible at 1300@xmath17c and slow cooled ( 1 - 2 deg / h ) to 900@xmath17c @xcite .",
    "single crystals in the form of elongated rods with typical dimensions of 5x2x2 mm were separated from this melt .",
    "the tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath8 single crystal studied was the same one previously studied by schriemer et al @xcite . in that study the relative as concentration in tbv@xmath0as@xmath9o@xmath8",
    "is given as x=0.15 , in good agreement with the value x=0.17 which we have determined from the current x - ray measurements .",
    "x - ray scattering measurements were performed using a rotating - anode , cu k@xmath20 x - ray source and a four circle diffractometer employing a two dimensional area detector .",
    "the single crystals were mounted within a helium - filled sample cell which was attached to the cold finger of a closed - cycle helium refrigerator .",
    "scattering measurements were carried out as a function of temperature with a temperature stability of @xmath11 0.005 k , appropriate for critical scattering studies .",
    "cuk@xmath21 radiation from the 18 kw rotating anode x - ray generator was selected using a perfect single crystal ge ( 110 ) monochromator .",
    "the diffracted beam was measured using a bruker histar area detector , mounted on the scattering arm at a distance of 0.7 m from the sample .",
    "this configuration allowed for high resolution characterization of the bragg peaks .",
    "the scattered intensity was measured as a function of temperature for both the ( 6,6,0 ) bragg reflection in the tetragonal phase , which splits into the ( 12,0,0 ) and ( 0 , 12 , 0 ) reflections in the twinned orthorhombic phase , as well as for the ( 8,0,0 ) bragg reflection in the tetragonal phase , which splits into ( 8 , 8 , 0 ) and ( 8 , -8 , 0 ) reflections in the same twinned orthorhombic phase .    ,",

    "related measurements of the orthorhombic strain have been measured previously as a function of temperature for the tbv@xmath0p@xmath9o@xmath8 system@xcite . however , the present measurements are taken sufficiently close to the phase transitions such that an accurate determination of t@xmath4 and a quantitative study of the critical properties of these phase transitions is possible .",
    "it is clear from the data that the order parameter , the orthorhombic strain , rises very sharply with decreasing temperature , such that little of this data would reside in the asymptotic critical regime , where the order parameter is small compared with its saturation value .",
    "therefore we fit this data to a full mean field solution , eq .",
    "1 , rather than simply to the asymptotic expression for small values of the order parameter . this gives a mean field critical exponent for the order parameter , @xmath25 = 0.5 , but the full data sets are accurately described .",

    "1 . for tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 ,",
    "a single majority and minority domain is visible at most temperatures .",
    "however the tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 data sets are qualitatively different with many domains visible even at temperatures well removed from t@xmath4 .",
    "for example , the data set for tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 at t=26.3 k ( t@xmath4 - 4 k ) shows a total of 5 twin domains ; 2 majority twin domains at high scattering angle and 3 minority twin domains at low scattering angle . moreover the dynamic range in domain orientation angle spanned by the multiple twin domains is considerably larger than is found in either tbvo@xmath2 or tbaso@xmath2 below t@xmath4 .",
    "figure 3 ( b ) quantifies this behaviour , following the splitting of the majority and minority twin domain orientation angles ( @xmath23 ) below t@xmath4 .",

    "this is very likely a manifestation of the quenched impurities on the jahn - teller driven phase transition in tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 .",
    "the behaviour of the twin domains below t@xmath4 in tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 can be qualitatively understood in terms of pinning of the twin domains by random strains due to the quenched impurities .",
    "clearly , this does not influence the critical properties of the order parameter , the orthorhombic strain , which remains well described by mean field behaviour at all temperatures , as is the case for both tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 .",
    "the influence of quenched impurities on twin domain interfaces has been investigated by light scattering techniques@xcite , which is expected to be sensitive to such large scale structure .",
    "the present results are qualitatively consistent with these results , showing stable multi - domain twin states in tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 , distinct from tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 , and therefore a larger volume fraction taken up by domain interfaces in tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 . however , the change in critical properties previously reported@xcite on introduction of quenched impurities is not observed .     for each of the three samples : tbvo@xmath2 ( closed symbols ) , tbaso@xmath2 ( open symbols ) and tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 ( crossed symbols ) .",

    "close examination of the scattering data sets at the ( 12 , 0 , 0)/(0 , 12 , 0 ) bragg positions in both tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 revealed a very interesting longitudinal broadening in the vicinity of t@xmath4 .",
    "representative longitudinal scans near the ( 6 , 6 , 0 ) bragg position in the tetragonal phase and ( 12 , 0 , 0 ) bragg positions in the orthorhombic phase of tbvo@xmath2 are shown in fig .",
    "very similar data was obtained for tbaso@xmath2 , but it is not displayed .",
    "figure 4 ( a ) shows a longitudinal scan through ( 6 , 6 , 0 ) well above t@xmath4 at t=47.05 k ( t@xmath4 + 13.8 k ) , while fig . 4 ( d ) shows a longitudinal scan through ( 12 , 0 , 0 ) at t=26.75 k , 6.51 k below t@xmath4 . both of these scans have approximately the same intrinsic width , and we consider them to be resolution limited .",
    "figures 4 ( b ) and ( c ) however , show longitudinal scans much closer to t@xmath4 .",
    "figure 4 ( b ) shows data just above t@xmath4 at t=33.58 k ( t@xmath4 + 0.32 k ) while fig .",
    "4 ( c ) shows the same scan just below t@xmath4 , at t=32.82 k ( t@xmath4 - 0.44 k ) .",
    "it is clear that both of these longitudinal scans near t@xmath4 are appreciably broader than those well removed from t@xmath4 , and therefore are not resolution limited .",
    "we associate this broadening with fluctuations in the order parameter , similar to that observed near continuous magnetic phase transitions . however , in the present case , fluctuations in the orthorhombic strain lead to a longitudinal broadening of bragg peaks of the form ( 6 , 6 , 0 ) in the tetragonal phase . rather than narrowing in angle or reciprocal space as the phase transition",
    "is approached , these peaks broaden and decrease in peak intensity as t@xmath4 is approached from above .",
    "broadening is also observed below t@xmath4 , but the widths of the bragg peaks fall off quickly , such that all the scattering in both tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 is resolution limited for temperatures more than 2 k below t@xmath4 .",
    "data of the form shown in fig .",
    "4 was fit to an ornstein - zernike form , eq .",
    "2 , convoluted with the resolution function appropriate to the measurement .",
    "we employed the scattering well above t@xmath4 , at t @xmath11 50 k , as the resolution function , assuming that all fluctuation effects are gone at such high temperatures .",
    "the results of fitting the tbvo@xmath2 data is shown as the solid lines in fig .",
    "4 , and this clearly provides an excellent description of the longitudinal scans at all temperatures , similar quality fits to the tbaso@xmath2 were also obtained .",
    "the resulting intrinsic widths to the longitudinal scans are shown as a function of temperature for tbvo@xmath2 in fig . 5 ( a ) and for tbaso@xmath2 in fig . 5 ( b ) .",
    "data is shown for both independent warming and cooling runs for both materials , although no significant history dependence to the widths of the scattering were observed . for temperatures below t@xmath4 , longitudinal scans through both majority and minority twin domains",
    "were investigated . over the narrow range of temperature below t@xmath4 for which a finite width can be observed ,",
    "the intrinsic widths of the majority and minority twin domain peaks differ , with the minority twin peak showing a greater intrinsic width than the majority twin domain , consistent with the interpretation of the minority twin domains as being relatively small .",
    "a related set of data near t@xmath4 was acquired for tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 , however the relevant longitudinal lineshapes were more complicated than those observed in tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 , and these results are not discussed here .",
    "@xmath28    the most striking and interesting result is that the intrinsic width of the bragg peaks , interpreted as an inverse correlation length , displays a pronounced peak at t@xmath4 , reminiscent of @xmath29 anomolies in the heat capacity of systems undergoing continuous phase transitions .",
    "the temperature dependence of the divergence of the intrinsic width , or inverse correlation length , is examined on a log - log plot in fig .",
    "6 , wherein data above t@xmath4 in tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 is plotted vs reduced temperature ( t - t@xmath4)/t@xmath4 .",
    "again independent warming and cooling runs are shown , with no history dependence observed .",
    "this plot , which employs the same t@xmath4s used to describe the critical properties of the order parameter shown in fig .",
    "3 , clearly brings out the power law nature of the divergence of the intrinsic width of the scattering as t@xmath4 is approached from above .",
    "figure 6 ( a ) shows this data for both tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 , and it is clear that both materials display a very similar power law divergence over at least one and a half decades in reduced temperature .",
    "figure 6 ( b ) shows the intrinsic width of the longitudinal scan in tbaso@xmath2 alone , where a single power law describes its divergence over almost three decades in reduced temperature .",
    "the exponent characterizing the divergence is x=0.45 @xmath30 0.04 .",
    "while we have characterized the power law divergence of the inverse correlation length , or intrinsic width , at t@xmath4 , we do not have a precise interpretation for this critical phenomenon . in their high - resolution",
    "gamma - ray diffraction experiments on tbvo@xmath2 , smith and tanner@xcite observed a broadening in the rocking - curve widths , that is the transverse width of the bragg peaks , as the phase transition was approached from above that somewhat resembles the broadening that we measured .",
    "they did not analyze it in detail , but suggested that it arose from the strains associated with random internal stresses relaxing as the elastic constant c@xmath31 tends to zero .",
    "while such a mechanism could contribute in our case , it is difficult to believe that it would exhibit critical behaviour over such a wide range and with such well defined power law behaviour as we observe .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "our observed longitudinal broadening of the ( 6 , 6 , 0 ) ( tetragonal ) and the ( 12 , 0 , 0)/(0 , 12 , 0 ) ( orthorhombic ) bragg peaks in fig . 5 greatly resembles heat capacity anomolies associated with continuous phase transitions .",
    "this may be a natural explanation of the intrinsic width , as the width is inversely proportional to the fluctuating domain size , and thus proportional to the volume fraction of the material occupied at any one time by interface .",
    "the energy of such a system would scale as the amount of interface , and a longitudinal bragg peak width scaling as a derivative of the energy , the heat capacity , seems physically resonable",
    ". the critical exponent x may be close to that describing fluctuations near a mean field , or mean field tricritical point , for which a large heat capacity exponent characteristic of a divergence is appropriate . at present",
    "we can not be more precise , but hope that the observation and characteriozation of this critical behaviour informs and motivates further work and understanding .",

    "we can compare the present results on the order parameter and fluctuations near the jahn - teller tetragonal to orthorhombic structural phase transitions in tbvo@xmath2 , tbaso@xmath2 and tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 , to those in related systems .",
    "the principal characteristics of the present results are mean field critical behaviour for the orthorhombic strain , and the observation of clear fluctuation effects in the vicinity of t@xmath4 .",
    "two topical and well studied systems which undergo tetragonal to orthorhombic structural phase transitions are the high temperature superconductors la@xmath32ba@xmath9cuo@xmath2 and la@xmath32sr@xmath9cuo@xmath2 .",
    "critical x - ray and neutron scattering on these materials do not show mean field behaviour , but rather the orthorhombic strain goes like the square of the order parameter@xcite , which is well described by three dimensional universality .",
    "theoretical expectations for these systems are for 3d xy critical behaviour@xcite , and this is consistent with what is observed@xcite .",
    "even qualitatively , it is clear that the growth in the orthorhombic strain with decreasing temperature in tbvo@xmath2 , tbaso@xmath2 and tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 is different from that observed in la@xmath32ba@xmath9cuo@xmath2 and la@xmath32sr@xmath9cuo@xmath2 . comparing to a recent high resolution x - ray scattering study on the la@xmath32ba@xmath9cuo@xmath2 system@xcite",
    ", we can see that the orthorhombic strain grows in a relatively gentle manner with decreasing temperature compared with what is observed in tbvo@xmath2 , tbaso@xmath2 and tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 .",
    "figure 3 shows that the latter orthorhombic strains grow to @xmath11 half of their saturation values at 0.9 @xmath33 t@xmath4 .",
    "the same growth in the la@xmath32ba@xmath9cuo@xmath2 system requires lower temperatures and half of saturation is only achived by @xmath11 0.7 t@xmath4 .",
    "there are differences of course , between the high temperature superconducting copper oxides and the terbium based oxides we report here .",
    "the cuprates are quasi - two - dimensional , for example , while tbvo@xmath2 , tbaso@xmath2 and tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 are three dimensional .",
    "most notably however the magnetic cu@xmath34 ion in la@xmath32ba@xmath9cuo@xmath2 and la@xmath32sr@xmath9cuo@xmath2 is not jahn - teller active - a single hole resides in a non - degenerate d orbital .",
    "this would appear to be the most likely source for the difference in critical behaviour .",
    "tbvo@xmath2 , tbaso@xmath2 and tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 possess tb@xmath7 ions whose orbitals and the occupation of the orbitals change on going through t@xmath4 , likely generating long range strain fields with concomittant mean field behaviour .    another interesting comparison is to other tb@xmath7-based transition metal oxides . here",
    "an interesting comparison can be made with a very recent high resolution x - ray scattering study of the cubic pyrochlore tb@xmath35ti@xmath35o@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this geometrically - frustrated magnetic material does not undergo a structural phase transition at finite temperature , but recent x - ray scattering measurements observe broadening of the allowed structural bragg peaks at low temperatures .",
    "these have been interpreted as fluctuations above a very low temperature jahn - teller phase transition , which is either never realized , or only realized at unattainably low temperatures .",
    "indeed , to our knowledge , the present work is the only other study of structural phase transitions which show such critical broadening of the bragg peaks in the vicinity of t@xmath4 .",
    "the temperature scale over which these fluctuations are observed is quite different in tb@xmath35ti@xmath35o@xmath36 as compared with tbvo@xmath2 , tbaso@xmath2 and tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 . in the present case",
    ", the broadening of the bragg peaks appears as critical phenomena and the strongest fluctuation effects fall off within a few degrees of t@xmath4 . in contrast , the jahn - teller - like fluctuations in tb@xmath35ti@xmath35o@xmath36 occur coincident with the formation of a spin liquid state , and are measureable over an extended regime of temperature from 20 k to 0.3 k.    finally we return to the issue of mean field criticality vs criticality associated with random fields .",
    "we did not observe a departure from mean field criticality associated with random fields in tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 .",
    "this may be because the random fields associated with the disorder are too weak to influence the critical behaviour in the range of reduced temperatures that we could access .",
    "a measure of the strength of the disorder and associated random fields is the extent to which they depress the transition temperature .",
    "the observed t@xmath4 for our mixed sample was 30.32 k , lower than the value 32.25 k expected from a linear variation in t@xmath4 between the two end members .",
    "this depression in t@xmath4 confirms that disorder is relevant and that associated random fields are present . in some related systems that have been studied , dyas@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath2@xcite and kh@xmath14as@xmath1p@xmath0o@xmath2@xcite , however , as well as dilute antiferromagnetic systems@xcite the depressions in t@xmath4 were larger and random - field critical behaviour",
    "was clearly observed .",
    "we have studied the critical properties near jahn - teller , tetragonal to orthorhombic structural phase transitions in tbvo@xmath2 , tbaso@xmath2 and tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 using high resolution x - ray scattering .",
    "these results show the order parameter , the orthorhombic strain , in all three materials to exhibit mean field criticality .",
    "the disordered member of this series , tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 is distinguished only in so far as it exhibits a wide dynamic range of majority and minority orthorhombic twin domain orientations , and these are stable to low temperatures .",
    "we ascribe this to the pinning of the domain structure by random strains arising from the quenched disorder in tbv@xmath18as@xmath19o@xmath2 .",
    "we also observe very interesting fluctuation effects in tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 in the vicinity of t@xmath4 .",
    "these are manifest in longitudinal broadening of the ( 6 , 6 , 0 ) bragg peaks in the tetragonal phase , which split to become ( 12 , 0 , 0 ) and ( 0 , 12 , 0 ) bragg peaks in the orthorhombic low temperature phase .",
    "this broadening exhibits a power law divergence at t@xmath4 , in tbvo@xmath2 and tbaso@xmath2 , with a critical exponent , x=0.45 @xmath30 0.04 . we hope that this latter work informs and motivates a full theoertical understanding of this fluctuation phenomena .",
