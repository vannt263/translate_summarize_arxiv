    "type iia ( iib ) string theory supports even - dimensional ( odd - dimensional ) stable bps d - branes and odd - dimensional ( even - dimensional ) unstable nonbps d - branes  @xcite .",
    "the physics of unstable d - branes involves various nonperturbative aspects of string theory .",
    "specifically , two representative examples are the tachyon solitons interpreted as lower - dimensional d - branes  @xcite and the rolling tachyon describing homogeneous real - time decay process of the d - brane  @xcite .",
    "the instability of a nonbps d@xmath0-brane in superstring theory or a d@xmath0-brane in bosonic string theory results in the appearance of a tachyonic degree . in the context of boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) , the tachyon vertex operator with a single spatial dependence which represents the exactly marginal deformation is given by a sinusoidal function with a single multiplicative parameter . when the parameter has the value 1/2 , the deformation is interpreted as an array of d@xmath9-branes in bosonic string theory or as a periodic array of a pair of a d@xmath9-brane and a @xmath10-brane in superstring theory  @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous rolling tachyon in bcft is described by introducing a marginal deformation corresponding to the tachyon profiles of hyperbolic sine , exponential , or hyperbolic cosine type .",
    "the physical quantities like the energy - momentum tensor suggest real - time decay of an unstable d - brane when the tachyon is displaced from the maximum of the tachyon potential and rolls down towards its minimum .    both homogeneous rolling tachyons and lower - dimensional d - branes from an unstable d - brane",
    "have also been studied in the context of effective field theories ( efts ) such as dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) type eft @xcite and boundary string field theory ( bsft ) eft @xcite .",
    "compared with the bcft approach , physical quantities such as energy - momentum tensor obtained from these efts are qualitatively the same as , but slightly different from that in bcft @xcite@xcite . for the case of the half",
    "s - brane with the exponential type of the tachyon profile  @xcite which is a special case of homogeneous rolling tachyons , the energy - momentum tensor based on the formula in ref .",
    "@xcite coincides exactly with that of dbi type effective action with 1/cosh potential  @xcite .",
    "when the fundamental strings exist in the worldvolume of unstable d@xmath0-brane , they couple to the second - rank antisymmetric tensor field ( or equivalently to the electromagnetic field strength tensor on the d - brane  @xcite ) and the string current density is given by the lorentz - covariant conjugate momentum of u(1 ) gauge field  @xcite .",
    "then one may study the effect of the electromagnetic field . for rolling tachyons ,",
    "the three types of deformations mentioned above are not changed by the presence of constant electric  @xcite , or both electric and magnetic  @xcite fields as far as they satisfy the physical condition , @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the electromagnetic field strength tensor .",
    "the situation is more interesting for the case of tachyon kinks which are identified as lower - dimensional d - branes of codimension one .",
    "the spectrum of the tachyon kink is not changed when the constant electric field is turned on with keeping @xmath11 ; only the period of d@xmath13 in the array becomes large as the electric field increases .",
    "however , when the electric field eventually reaches the critical value for which the determinant vanishes , the period becomes infinite and we obtain a single regular bps tachyon kink with constant electric flux .",
    "it is interpreted as a thick bps d@xmath9-brane in the background of fundamental string charge density .",
    "this has been checked in various languages including dbi eft  @xcite , bcft  @xcite , noncommutative field theory ( ncft )  @xcite , and bsft  @xcite .    in the presence of both constant electric and constant magnetic fields in an unstable d@xmath0-brane with @xmath14 ,",
    "it turns out that other types of deformations are possible .",
    "this is because the 11-component of the cofactor @xmath15 of @xmath16 can have either negative or positive value while keeping @xmath17 .",
    "( here , @xmath1 denotes the coordinate on which the tachyon depends . ) for small electromagnetic fields the cofactor @xmath15 is negative . in this case",
    "the species of tachyon kinks are essentially the same as those without electromagnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath14 , electromagnetic fields can take large values for which @xmath15 becomes positive while maintaining the condition @xmath17 . in this case , three new codimension - one objects are supported , which correspond to tachyon profiles of hyperbolic sine , exponential , and hyperbolic cosine types .",
    "these objects have been obtained in aforementioned efts including dbi eft  @xcite , ncft  @xcite , and bsft  @xcite .",
    "they , however , have not yet been reproduced in the context of bcft for type ii superstring theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze these three kinks in the context of bcft .    in section  [ section2 ] ,",
    "we describe new tachyon vertices of hyperbolic sine , exponential , and hyperbolic cosine types with the dependence on a single spatial coordinate , and show that they give marginal deformations in the context of bcft .",
    "in addition , these tachyon profiles are obtained as static solutions of the linearized tachyon equation in the background of a nontrivial open string metric and a noncommutativity parameter of open string field theory ( osft ) . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we construct the boundary states corresponding to the marginal deformations given in section  [ section2 ] .",
    "we utilize lorentz transformation and t - duality in subsection [ subsection3 - 1 ] while the overlap condition is directly solved in subsection [ subsection3 - 2 ] to construct the boundary states . in section  [ section4 ]",
    "we read the corresponding physical quantities , specifically the energy - momentum tensor @xmath18 and the fundamental string current density @xmath19 . for the case of hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine types of tachyon profiles ,",
    "they are slightly different from those in efts as expected  @xcite , but , for the exponential type , they coincide exactly with the results of efts .",
    "they are interpreted as negative tension branes for hyperbolic sine and cosine profiles and tensionless half brane for exponential profile in the huge constant background of positive energy density .",
    "we conclude in section  [ section5 ] . in the appendix",
    ", we give an alternative derivation of the energy - momentum tensor for the exponential type deformation by calculating the partition function of the worldsheet action following ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section we show that there exist three new tachyon vertices as marginal deformations in the presence of the constant electromagnetic field .",
    "they are hyperbolic sine , hyperbolic cosine , and exponential types which depend on a single spatial coordinate .",
    "we shall show this first in the scheme of bcft and then in the context of linearized osft .    in the bcft description of bosonic string theory ,",

    "note that when @xmath119 , @xmath15 becomes positive while @xmath106 remains negative as long as the magnetic field @xmath109 is sufficiently strong .",
    "then the tachyon profile becomes of the hyperbolic type @xmath120 where @xmath121 this is in contrast with the rolling tachyons in which @xmath122 is always negative .",
    "actually @xmath123 is positive irrespective of the values of constant electromagnetic field and the dimension @xmath0 of d - brane . therefore turning on the electromagnetic field",
    "does not give rise to a new type of deformation for the case of rolling tachyons .",
    "without loss of the generality , the tachyon profile may be classified into the following three cases depending on the asymptotic behaviors , @xmath124 where @xmath125 for bosonic string and @xmath126 for superstrings .",
    "note that the coordinate @xmath30 is a spatial direction along the d - brane .",
    "nevertheless the form of the operator looks like that of rolling tachyons thanks to the strong electromagnetic field .",
    "this deformation is however entirely physical and can be obtained through a chain of maps involving t - duality , lorentz boost , and rotation  @xcite as discussed in subsection [ subsection3 - 1 ] where the corresponding boundary state is constructed .",
    "one comment is in order . for bosonic string ,",
    "the boundary term is the same as the tachyon profile ( [ lv ] ) . for superstrings ,",
    "tachyon vertex operators corresponding to ( [ lv ] ) in the @xmath127-picture are of the form @xmath128 .",

    "let us consider the linearized equations of motion in osft ignoring the interaction among various fields except the coupling to constant electromagnetic field .",
    "near the perturbative string vacuum , the tachyonic degree due to the instability of an unstable d - brane can be described by a real scalar field @xmath130 and its action in the presence of the constant electromagnetic field is expressed in terms of an open string metric @xmath53 and a noncommutativity parameter @xmath54 in ( [ op ] ) , @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 denotes star product between the tachyon fields .",
    "@xmath134 is the square of the tachyon mass which is equal to @xmath127 for bosonic string theory and @xmath135 for superstring theory in our convention .",

    "depend on @xmath143 .",
    "when @xmath15 is positive , the solution is given by ( [ lv ] ) . in the absence of the electromagnetic field , @xmath144 and",
    "although the obtained tachyon configurations ( [ lv ] ) are static solutions of the linearized tachyon equation with the coupling of constant electromagnetic field , the linear tachyon system is obtained through a consistent truncation of full open string field equations restricting the fields to a universal subspace and then the obtained solutions ( [ lv ] ) are expected to be solutions of full open string equations  @xcite .",
    "in this section we construct the boundary state for the hyperbolic type of marginal deformation ( [ lv ] ) along a spatial direction in the presence of a strong constant electromagnetic field . for definiteness",

    "we denote the worldsheet fields of the brane by @xmath149 and assume that the constant electric field denoted by @xmath150 is along the @xmath145-direction .",
    "the rolling tachyon is then described by the exactly marginal boundary operator  @xcite @xmath151 we compactify the @xmath146-direction on a circle of radius @xmath33 and wrap the d25-brane on it .    under the t - dualization of the @xmath146-direction ,",
    "the right - moving part of @xmath152 changes its sign while the other fields remain unchanged , @xmath153 the d25-brane is then turned into an array of d24-branes on the dual circle . taking the decompactification limit",

    "as mentioned previously , this can easily be understood by unbounded nature of the tachyon potential in bosonic string theory for the region of negative tachyon in ( [ lv ] ) .    though we considered only the case of d1 from an unstable d2 , but the extension to the higher dimensional case of d@xmath9 from d@xmath0 is straightforward . the aforementioned negative - tension branes and tensionless half brane are obtained only with a component of overcritical electric field . as we have discussed , such configurations with overcritical electric field seem to be unavoidable in the context of bcft and may need further study in the context of string theory beyond bcft .",
    "recently the topic of marginal deformations is systematically dealt in the osft  @xcite , so will be the case of the obtained new tachyon vertices with the development of constant electromagnetic field . when the quantum radiations are taken into account including perturbative closed string modes such as gravitons , dilatons , and antisymmetric tensor fields , dynamical evolution of the negative - tension branes and tensionless half brane may become a more intriguing topic .",
    "finally , let us comment on the results in other approaches such as dbi eft and ncft with 1/cosh tachyon potential  @xcite . if we compare the physical quantities @xmath390 and @xmath391 in the bcft for superstrings with those in dbi eft and ncft with @xmath392 tachyon potential , the bcft results coincide exactly with the eft results for the case of exponential type tachyon profile ( ( ii ) of ( [ lv ] ) )  @xcite . for hyperbolic sine ( ( i ) of ( [ lv ] ) ) and hyperbolic cosine ( ( iii ) of ( [ lv ] ) ) cases , the @xmath141-dependent part of physical quantities match qualitatively but do not exactly coincide with those of dbi eft and ncft",
    "in this paper , we considered a flat unstable d@xmath0-brane ( @xmath14 ) in the presence of a large constant electromagnetic field in the framework of bcft .",
    "specifically , we studied the case that the electromagnetic field satisfies the following three conditions : first , a constant electric field is turned on along the @xmath1 direction ( @xmath2 ) ; second , the determinant of the matrix @xmath3 is negative so that it lies in the physical region ( @xmath4 ) ; third , the 11-component of its cofactor is positive to the large electromagnetic field ( @xmath393 ) . for the simplest case , @xmath71",
    ", these conditions reduce to @xmath2 , @xmath394 , and @xmath395 , respectively . in the background of such electromagnetic fields",
    ", we identified exactly marginal deformations depending on the spatial coordinate @xmath1 , which correspond to tachyon profiles of hyperbolic sine , exponential , and hyperbolic cosine types .",
    "the corresponding boundary states were constructed by utilizing t - duality approach and also by directly solving the overlap conditions in bcft .    for these boundary states , we calculated the energy - momentum tensor and the fundamental string current density .",
    "boundary states for the tachyon profiles of hyperbolic sine , exponential , and hyperbolic cosine correspond to nonbps topological kink , half kink , and bounce in the effective field theories ( dbi , ncft , bsft ) , respectively . in superstring theories , the first and third configurations have negative tensions and the second configuration gives tensionless half brane connecting the perturbative string vacuum and one of the true tachyon vacua .",
    "the result obtained here in the bcft description completes identifying all possible codimension - one static solutions on an unstable d@xmath0-brane in the presence of a constant electromagnetic field . without an electromagnetic field",
    ", there exists a unique static solution of which the tachyon profile is sinusoidal with the period @xmath396  @xcite .",
    "when a constant electromagnetic field is turned on , the spectrum of static solutions becomes rich ; there are five types of solutions for @xmath14 , as summarized in the table  1 .",
    "this result coincides with that from dbi type eft  @xcite , ncft  @xcite , and bsft  @xcite .",
    "the detailed forms of the energy - momentum tensor and the fundamental string current density in the bcft are qualitatively in agreement with those of the efts for cosine ( sine ) , hyperbolic sine , and hyperbolic cosine types of tachyon profiles . for the linear and the exponential types , the physical quantities in the bcft",
    "are exactly the same as those in the efts .",
