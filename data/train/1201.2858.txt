    "its ultimate goal is to detect primordial gw backgrounds , but it has promising astrophysical sources such as binary stellar - mass black holes .",
    "it is also sensitive to merging signals from binary intermediate - mass black holes .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid to the surrounding environment of the gw sources .",
    "several types of possible electromagnetic ( em ) signatures associated with gw emissions have been proposed , such as afterglows @xcite , precursors @xcite and periodic emission @xcite in the context of a massive black hole coalescence",
    ". those em signatures will be also very useful in localizing the position of a gw source in the sky and in identifying its redshift . by combining the redshift information with a luminosity distance determined by the gw signal",
    ", one can obtain a distance - redshift relation .",
    "this will be one of the best observational probes of the dark energy @xcite",
    ". however , there are not so many works discussing em signals from coalescing binary black holes in the stellar / intermediate mass range @xmath8 .",
    "obviously , no black holes can emit em radiation , unless they interact with their environmental gas .",
    "thus , our interest is naturally led to binary stellar / interstellar - mass black holes in a dense gaseous medium .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of hydrodynamic interactions between an advection - dominated accretion flow onto a supermassive black hole and inspiraling stars on gw signals .",
    "this effect was shown to be negligible as long as the advection - dominated accretion flow is concerned .",
    "the effects of the interaction with a gaseous disk on the gw phase evolution have been also discussed in the context of an extreme mass ratio inspiral ( emri ) , where a compact object inspirals into a supermassive black hole @xcite . in this case",
    "the situation is more similar to a planet migration .",
    "it has been claimed that the existence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole is detectable for a certain parameter range with _",
    "lisa_.    in contrast , a binary composed of black holes with nearly equal masses residing in a gaseous environment will form a triple disk system : two accretion disks around the respective black holes and one circumbinary disk surrounding both of them @xcite . then",
    ", the binary black holes and the circumbinary disk should mutually interact , which inevitably affects the orbital evolution of the binary .",
    "the gas surrounding the binary acts on the orbital motion through a drag force ( tidal / resonant interaction ) , leading to the angular momentum transfer from the binary to the gas .",
    "conversely , the angular momentum is carried from the circumbinary disk to the binary by gas accretion . since _",
    "decigo / bbo _ will detect many cycles of gws from the binary inspiral , a rather tiny correction in the gw phase is detectable .",
    "therefore signature of the circumbinary disk can arise in the gw signal even if the circumbinary disk is extremely less massive by many orders of magnitude than the binary . in this paper",
    ", we give an estimate how large the mass accretion rates of the circumbinary disk should be , so that we can detect the effect of the binary - disk interaction on the gw phase evolution at a statistically significant level with _ decigo / bbo_. note that we evaluate the effect of the binary - disk interaction at the first order in a mass accretion rate of the circumbinary disk throughout this paper .",
    "although our current understanding of the binary - disk interaction is poor , we assume here that we knew how the gw phase evolution is modified and hence the standard matched filtering analysis is applicable .",
    "based on our estimate of the mass accretion rate required for detection , we also give a prediction for the number of merger events under detectable influence of the circumbinary disk .",
    "in this section , we first briefly explain the basics about how the phase of gws from a binary evolves as a result of the radiation reaction due to the gw emission .",
    "second , we present the picture that we have in mind about the interaction between the binary and the circumbinary disk , providing a quantitative estimate for the correction due to the binary - disk interaction in the gw phase evolution .",
    "we relate the magnitude of the correction to the mass accretion rate of the circumbinary disk .",
    "then , we evaluate the determination accuracy of the mass accretion rate of the circumbinary disk .",
    "let us first briefly review the evolution of the gw phase of a coalescing binary , neglecting the interaction between the binary and the circumbinary disk .",
    "close enough binaries are expected to evolve their orbits by losing the energy and angular momentum due to the gw emission . here , we assume that binary black holes are in a circular orbit , because the orbital eccentricity decreases rapidly in proportion to @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the semi - major axis of the binary . at the leading order of the post - newtonian ( pn )",
    "expansion , the binding energy and orbital angular momentum of a circular binary are , respectively , given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath13 is the reduced mass with @xmath14 representing the total mass of binary black holes , @xmath15 is a non - dimensional quantity of @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is an orbital frequency of the binary .",
    "the leading terms in the gw energy and angular momentum fluxes emitted from a binary are given by the well - known quadrupole formulas as @xmath18 with @xmath19 and a dot represents differentiation with respect to time .",
    "for an equal - mass binary , @xmath20 is set to be @xmath21 .",
    "the orbit of the binary gradually decays as a result of the loss of its energy and angular momentum due to the gw emission . equating the time variation of the orbital energy or angular momentum with the loss due to the gw emission , one can derive , to the lowest pn order , @xmath22 , which is translated into the evolution equation for the gw frequency @xmath23 as @xmath24 where we introduced the chirp mass , @xmath25 .    integrating this equation with the coalescence time set to @xmath26 ,",
    "the time evolution of the gw frequency is computed as @xmath27\\ , \\eta_{0.25}^{-3/8 } { \\it m}_{10}^{-5/8 } \\left(\\frac{\\it t_{\\rm{0}}-t}{1yr}\\right)^{-3/8 } \\ , , \\label{fobs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use @xmath28 and @xmath29 for brevity .",
    "one can translate this frequency evolution into the evolution of @xmath10 , using the relation @xmath30 , that is , @xmath31\\ , \\eta_{0.25}^{1/4 } { \\it m}_{10}^{3/4 } \\left(\\frac{\\it t_{\\rm{0 } } - t}{1yr}\\right)^{1/4}\\ , .",

    ". when the mass of each black hole is @xmath35 and the observation starts one year before the coalescence , the initial gw frequency and the initial semi - major axis are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . in the typical case",
    "one can observe @xmath38 cycles of gws .",
    "such a large number of orbital cycles allow us to precisely measure the gw phase correction possibly to the level sensitive to the tiny effect of the circumbinary disk .",
    "the observed waveform of gws from the binary at the leading pn order is given by @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a factor of at most order unity that depends on the direction and orientation of the binary and @xmath41 is the distance from the earth to the gw source . the gw phase @xmath42 is defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the gw phase at the coalescence .      in this subsection , we consider the correction to the phase evolution of gws emitted from an inspiralling binary caused by the interaction with the circumbinary disk .",
    "such binary - disk interaction induces additional extraction of the orbital angular momentum from the binary .",
    "this effect will be tiny compared to the phase evolution driven by the gw emission when the binary separation is close enough to be observable by future gw detectors . even in that case",
    ", however , the correction might be observable because of a large number of cycles of gws in the frequency range of observations .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the orbital evolution is dominated by the radiation reaction due to the gw emission . in this case it would be natural to assume that the orbit is well approximated by a quasi - circular one .",
    "although the circumbinary disk is not necessarily aligned to the binary orbital plane , here we also assume a simple aligned configuration .    the exchange between the orbital angular momentum of the binary , @xmath45 , and the angular momentum of the circumbinary disk is in two ways .",
    "one is the angular momentum transfer through the tidal / resonant interaction @xcite .",
    "the other is through the overflow of the gas from the inner edge of circumbinary disk onto the central binary @xcite .",
    "the transferred gas will form accretion disks around respective black holes  @xcite . during this accretion process",
    ", some fraction of the angular momentum of the transferred gas will temporally go to the accretion disks associated with respective black holes . however , since the specific angular momentum of gas at the inner edges of the accretion disks is so tiny , only little fraction of the angular momentum of the accretion disks is transferred to the black hole spins .",
    "thus , most of this angular momentum is transferred outward via the viscous process and is finally added to the orbital angular momentum of the binary @xmath45 via the tidal interaction  @xcite .",
    "therefore we can neglect the angular momentum that ends up with the spins of the black holes .",
    "thus , the net angular momentum extracted from the binary orbital one due to interaction with the circumbinary disk , @xmath46 , should be almost identical to the net angular momentum flow inside the circumbinary disk , @xmath47 , which simply follows from the conservation law .",
    "( we take the flow of the angular momentum to be positive when it flows outward . )",
    "now , we roughly estimate the order of magnitude of @xmath47 , without relying on a specific model of the circumbinary disk . for a quasi - stationary disk",
    ", @xmath47 should be independent of the radius @xmath48 , which should be equal to the sum of the flows of angular momentum by the viscous torque @xmath49 and by the mass accretion @xmath50 , @xmath51 except near the inner edge of the disk located at @xmath52 , where the tidal / resonant torque is non - negligible .",
    "note that @xmath53 is negative when the mass is accreting inward . since @xmath54 increases with @xmath48 like @xmath55 for a keplerian disk , @xmath56 and @xmath54 approximately balance with each other except near the inner edge of the circumbinary disk .",
    "if we were discussing an accretion disk around a single central object , the radius of the inner edge of the disk would be much smaller than that of the circumbinary disk . in this case",
    ", @xmath56 should be almost balanced with @xmath54 near @xmath52 . in the present situation , however , the binary exerts the tidal / resonant torque , which truncates the disk at @xmath52 .",
    "then , the surface density of the disk is enhanced near the inner edge by a factor of two or so compared with the case without the tidal / resonant torque  ( e.g. , see figure  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , the viscous torque is also locally enhanced by about the same ratio .",
    "this implies that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the keplerian frequency of the circumbinary disk measured at @xmath59 and @xmath60 is set to be positive when the mass flux is inward . in the last approximate equality @xmath59",
    "was approximated by @xmath61  @xcite . since currently we are not able to make the estimate of @xmath62 more precise , we introduce a parameter @xmath63 that represents the efficiency of angular momentum transfer from the binary to the circumbinary disk ( recall that @xmath64 ) .",
    "the angular momentum transfer from a circular equal - mass binary to the circumbinary disk has been recently studied by performing hydrodynamic simulations with @xmath65-prescription @xcite and magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations @xcite . in both simulations",
    "the sound velocity was set by hand instead of solving the energy equation .",
    "in such a numerical setup , one can freely scale the binary mass @xmath66 , the semi - major axis @xmath10 , and the surface density of the circumbinary disk @xmath67 . @xcite",
    "derived the averaged mass accretion rate @xmath68 and the angular momentum flux carried by the circumbinary disk @xmath69 from the simulated result after @xmath70 binary orbital cycles , where @xmath71 is a typical value of @xmath67 introduced for the normalization . on the other hand , @xcite derived @xmath72 and @xmath73 after @xmath74 binary orbital cycles . substituting these values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 into equation  ( [ dotjoverj ] )",
    ", we can estimate the efficiency parameter @xmath3 to be @xmath77 for the former simulation and @xmath78 for the latter simulation , independent of @xmath10 , @xmath66 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the scatter of @xmath3 between these two simulations will be mainly attributed to the difference in the strength of shear viscosity .",
    "@xcite assumed that the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter @xmath79 to be @xmath80 , whereas the effective value of @xmath79 derived from the mhd simulation by @xcite was @xmath81 .",
    "namely , @xmath3 becomes larger for smaller viscosity .",
    "one can explain this tendency qualitatively as follows : when the mass accretion rate is fixed , the circumbinary disk becomes more massive for smaller viscosity , while a more massive disk gains larger resonant torque from the binary .",
    "the black hole growth due to the mass accretion from the circumbinary disk to each of the black holes via accretion disks can also modify the binary orbital evolution .",
    "we note from equation  ( [ dotjoverj ] ) that the growth rate of binary mass @xmath82 is the same order as the rate of the angular momentum transfer @xmath83 , if @xmath3 is the order of unity .",
    "hence , for simplicity , we absorb this mass growth effect into the coefficient @xmath3 in equation  ( [ dotjoverj ] ) and neglect the time variation of the binary mass in the following discussion .    from the angular momentum conservation @xmath84 we can derive the increasing rate of the gw frequency from equations  ( [ binde ] ) , ( [ gwflux ] ) , ( [ dotjoverj ] ) , and ( [ ecl ] ) as @xmath85 . \\label{fdot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in the square brackets of equation  ( [ fdot ] ) is the leading contribution from the quadrupole gw radiation given in equation  ( [ quadrupoledotf ] ) .",

    "it can be evaluated by substituting @xmath204 into the expression of @xmath67 given in equation  ( [ sig ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : dm ] shows the inner - most disk mass of the circumbinary disk that is detectable by gws .",
    "they are evaluated at the beginning of the observation period of @xmath134@xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 yr , respectively .",
    "we also adopt @xmath208 .",
    "it shows that the existence of the circumbinary disk can be confirmed , even if the disk mass is less than the binary mass by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this is because we can observe many ( @xmath209 ) cycles of gws .",
    "we can understand the binary mass dependence of @xmath210 in figure  [ fig : dm ] in the following way .",
    "the semi - major axis for a fixed value of @xmath95 is proportional to @xmath211 from equation  ( [ acoales ] ) and the surface density at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk is proportional to @xmath212 from equation  ( [ sig ] ) .",
    "when @xmath60 is given in equation  ( [ mdot : low ] ) , we find @xmath213 in the mass range @xmath0 for five year observation .",
    "this is roughly in agreement with the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : dm ] .",
    "when @xmath214 of the binary is shorter than the viscous timescale evaluated at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk , the binary is decoupled from the circumbinary disk .",
    "after the decoupling , no binary - disk interaction occurs so that it is impossible to detect the effect of the circumbinary disk by the gw observation .",
    "the viscous timescale measured at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk is given by @xmath215 where we used the relation for the disk viscosity @xmath216 and @xmath217 with equations  ( [ hr ] ) and ( [ cs ] ) .",
    "the decoupling radius at which @xmath218 is given by @xmath219 even when @xmath214 is shorter than @xmath220 , the binary continues to gravitationally interact with the circumbinary disk until the binary orbit decays down to @xmath221 . in the mass range of @xmath222 ,",
    "the condition @xmath223 is satisfied even at one year before the coalescence .",
    "namely , the binary continues to gravitationally interact with the circumbinary disk , as we described , at least at the early stage of the gw phase evolution during the observation period .",
    "thus , although we take no account of the decoupling effect in figure  [ fig : da ] , this neglect has been justified in the mass range @xmath224 . for the larger mass range ,",
    "the determination accuracy is deteriorated by taking into account the decoupling effect . however , for @xmath225 , _ decigo / bbo _ is completely insensitive to the circumbinary disk when the mass accretion rate is smaller than the eddington rate .",
    "the bhl accretion rate can exceed the eddington rate depending on parameters : @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath66 .",
    "x - ray observations have detected the bright x - ray sources , such as grs  1915 + 105 in our galaxy , with a luminosity over the eddington one ( cf .",
    "such large luminosities can be explained by a supercritical accretion flow onto stellar - mass black holes .",
    "if the circumbinary disk is in a super - critical state , equation  ( [ ad ] ) does not apply .",
    "since the accretion timescale is much shorter than the viscous timescale in the super - critical state , the binary will not be decoupled from the circumbinary disk until the coalescence , although it is still unclear how such a circumbinary disk evolves @xcite .",
    "we have derived the minimum mass accretion rate of a circumbinary disk around binary stellar / intermediate - mass black holes necessary for the detection by future space - borne gw detectors such as _ decigo / bbo_. our main conclusions are summarized as follows :    1 .   the circumbinary disk with @xmath228\\,{\\it j}^{-1 } ( { \\it m}/10{\\it m}_\\odot)^{33/23}$ ] with @xmath2 mass - to - energy conversion efficiency , where @xmath3 represents the efficiency of the angular momentum transfer defined by equation  ( [ dotjoverj ] ) , within @xmath177 from the earth is detectable at a statistically significant level with _",
    "decigo / bbo _ by observing for five years before the coalescence .",
    "the determination accuracy of the mass accretion rate is higher at a closer distance from the earth , and is also higher for a longer observation time . 2 .",
    "if binary stellar - mass black holes are residing in sufficiently dense molecular clouds , the influence of the circumbinary disk will be detectable . the number of merger events of such binaries within @xmath177 for five year observation , is approximately estimated to be @xmath229 by assuming typical values for the event rate of the black hole coalescence and that molecular clouds have the number density from @xmath230 to @xmath174 given in equation  ( [ nmc ] ) .",
    "this suggests that there might be a possibility to detect the circumbinary disk around binary stellar - mass black holes with _",
    "decigo / bbo_.    in the estimate presented in this paper , we still have a lot of uncertainties , _",
    "e.g. , _ the formation rate of binary black holes , the molecular hydrogen number density , the relative velocity to the molecular cloud , the efficiency of angular momentum transfer ( @xmath231 : see equation  ( [ dotjoverj ] ) ) , and so on .",
    "therefore , we should understand that there remains a possibility that the event rate is one or two orders of magnitude larger than our estimate .    for the idealized situation that we discussed in this paper ,",
    "the correction to the gw phase evolution shows @xmath232pn frequency dependence .",
    "this dependence is the same as the one for a braneworld model discussed in @xcite .",
    "similarly , the cosmic acceleration @xcite and the alternative theories of gravity in which the gravitational constant @xmath233 is not a costant @xcite also give the corrections with @xmath232pn frequency dependence .",
    "furthermore , the acceleration acting on a binary in time - independent external gravitational field gives the correction with the same frequency dependence @xcite .",
    "therefore , once the deviation from the standard template is discovered , discriminating the effect of the circumbinary disk from the others will be a difficult task .",
    "however , for example , the binary - disk interaction rapidly decays after the decoupling of the circumbinary disk as we discussed in section  [ sec : decoupling ] .",
    "this is a signature unique to the interaction with the circumbinary disk .",
    "in addition , there can be a method to distinguish the effect of the circumbinary disk from that of modified gravity theory by detecting the gw signals from multiple sources .",
    "this is because the effect of modified gravity theory is universal , whereas that of circumbinary disk is not .",
    "therefore , further detailed studies may provide some ways of distinctions .",
    "in this paper we have assumed that the binary is in a circular orbit .",
    "the orbital eccentricity also gives the frequency dependence of negative pn order ( -19/6pn ) @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the orbital eccentricity as a parameter of the waveform reduces the determination accuracy of @xmath232pn order term by some factors .",
    "however , we expect that we can determine both the orbital eccentricity and the mass accretion rate for the large mass parameter range with errors of @xmath229 for typical binary parameters .",
    "@xcite calculated the determination accuracies of full seventeen binary parameters including an initial orbital eccentricity for binary massive black holes with _",
    "lisa _ , using a bayesian analysis under markov chain monte carlo simulations .",
    "they conclude that the _ lisa _ could distinguish between circular orbit and eccentric orbit with a very small orbital eccentricity @xmath234 .    furthermore",
    ", we would like to point out that the effect of the circumbinary disk can be important , even if it is suppressed to the undetectable level for each event .",
    "the primary mission of the space - borne gw antennas such as _ decigo / bbo _ is to measure the primordial gw background radiation . in order to achieve this goal ,",
    "abundant binary gw sources become the foreground noises . to remove them , the expected gw signals for the events identified by the matched filtering",
    "will be subtracted from the data . however , if the theoretical templates contain some unknown elements , the subtraction leaves residuals that remain to contribute to confusion noises @xcite .    finally , we briefly mention the relevance of our discussion to the ground - based gw detectors . with these detectors , the distance to which we can detect gws from binary black holes",
    "is reduced , and hence the expected event rate is extremely small . using the third - generation - ground - based gw detector : einstein telescope ( et ) , and assuming",
    "high signal - to - noise ratio corresponding to an accidentally nearby event at @xmath235mpc , the effect of the circumbinary disk will be detectable only for the mass accretion rate @xmath236 times higher than the eddington rate .",
    "even if stellar - mass binary black holes are at rest in a dense molecular cloud core , the expected bhl accretion rate is @xmath237 times as much as the eddington rate .",
    "hence , we would be able to safely conclude that the effect of the circumbinary disk becomes relevant only for space - borne gw detectors such as _ decigo / bbo_.    the authors are grateful to the members of the regular meeting on gravity and gravitational waves ( gg seminar ) at department of physics , kyoto university for helpful and continuous discussions .",
