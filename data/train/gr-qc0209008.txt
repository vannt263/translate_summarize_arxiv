    "the words `` quantum gravity '' have become associated by physicists over the years with `` difficult problem '' . attempts to quantize general relativity started almost immediately after quantum mechanics was establishes ( see the article by rovelli @xcite for a concise history of the field ) . among the people involved",
    "are the most stellar names in physics .",
    "indeed , one should expect problems when attempting to apply the rules of quantum mechanics to general relativity .",
    "although general relativity was developed before quantum mechanics , the latter was introduced in the context of newtonian physics .",
    "already the incorporation of special relativity required some effort and in fact , the introduction of quantum field theory , which in many ways is an extension of quantum mechanics .",
    "general relativity however , is a much more radical revision of physics than special relativity .",
    "it is a theory of space - time itself as opposed to a theory of entities living in a spacetime .",
    "quantum mechanics was firmly based on the latter viewpoint .",
    "this key element separates general relativity from almost all other physics theories .",
    "the invariance of the theory under coordinate redefinitions , which is more clearly viewed as invariance of the variables under diffeomorphisms , is not present in any other significant physical theory .",
    "in fact , we have only learnt how to apply the rules of quantum mechanics to theories invariant under diffeomorphisms relatively recently @xcite . and the theories in question , like bf theory or chern  simons theory , are remarkably simpler than general relativity",
    ". these theories are only superficially field theories , in that they are described in terms of fields , but the true degrees of freedom of the theories are finite in number .",
    "they are , in fact , mechanical systems instead of field theories . solutions of the equations of motion are given by fields that are `` trivial '' , the only non - trivialities coming from possible topological features of the manifolds the theories live on .",
    "once one realizes this fact , it should not be surprising that their quantization becomes relatively straightforward .",
    "there is a strong sociological element involved in quantum gravity as well .",
    "after the many successes of quantum field theory following world war ii , it could only be expected that the application of the same powerful techniques to general relativity should finally conquer the problem .",
    "but this was not so .",
    "the application of perturbation theory to general relativity taught many interesting lessons , consolidating the ideas of gauge and ghosts .",
    "but it ultimately appeared to fail .",
    "general relativity appears to be perturbatively non - renormalizable .",
    "the practitioners of quantum field theory became so discouraged by this fact , that they adopted the point of view that general relativity should be abandoned as a physical theory .",
    "it is not that the successes of the theory explaining the classical world are in question .",
    "it is the fundamental nature of the theory . in this point of view",
    "general relativity would play the role of an effective theory .",
    "the lagrangian and field equations of general relativity should be viewed as , for instance , those of the navier  stokes theory of fluids . a highly successful and useful theory , but not one that anyone would care to quantize , for instance , to describe a quantum fluid .",
    "just like in the case of quantum fluids one quantizes a theory underlying the navier ",
    "stokes one , one would quantize a theory underlying general relativity . a theory that reproduces general relativity only in certain regimes , but is richer in other regimes .",
    "another analogy that comes to mind is the fermi theory of weak interactions , non - renormalizable and just a low energy manifestation of a richer theory , the theory of weak interactions .",
    "this point of view led to the development of supersymmetric theories , supergravity , kaluza - klein theories , superstrings and m - theory .",
    "is this point of view the only one ? strictly speaking ,",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "general relativity only describes gravity , and therefore a richer theory should come into play in order to have a unified picture of all interactions , so general relativity indeed should be the limit of a larger theory . but even if one ignores all other interactions , are we completely sure that general relativity can not be quantized",
    "? this appears as an academic question .",
    "after all , if we know we need a larger theory , why bother with determining if general relativity can be quantized ?",
    "the reason this question is , in the view of some people , not of purely academic interest , is that general relativity has features that we would all desire in a unified description of nature .",
    "most notably , the fact that space - time is dynamical and invariant under diffeomorphisms . in a sense ,",
    "general relativity is perhaps the simplest theory incorporating these features with non - trivial content .",
    "lessons learnt from attempting to quantize it should therefore be very valuable at the time of quantizing a richer theory .",
    "these are the reasons propelling a small but non - trivial ( see @xcite for some statistics ) minority of physicists to study the quantization of general relativity .    but is nt the fact that the theory is non - renormalizable an indictment of this program ?",
    "how could one quantize such a theory ?",
    "to understand this we need to separate an intrinsic question ( is the theory quantizable or not ) from a procedural question ( can we quantize it using perturbation theory ) .",
    "these two questions are different . in fact , we know of examples of theories that admit a quantum description and that we do not know how to treat perturbatively .",
    "de witt s group @xcite studied sigma models that have this feature . but more striking is the example of general relativity in @xmath0 dimensions . in dimensions",
    "lower than four , the einstein equations just state that the metric is flat .",
    "general relativity in such a situation is only an apparent field theory , since the only solution to the equations is `` constant '' .",
    "one can have degrees of freedom if the topology of the manifold is non - trivial .",
    "yet , when perturbative quantization of general relativity in @xmath0 dimensions was attempted , the theory appeared to be non - renormalizable more or less in the same way the four dimensional version was .",
    "it was only when witten @xcite noticed that one should be able to perform a non - perturbative quantization , and carried it out , that people realized one could find ways to treat the theory perturbatively @xcite .    the general relativity in @xmath0 dimensions example exhibits in a dramatic way the pitfalls expecting anyone attempting to quantize these kinds of theories .",
    "the lesson is that the symmetries of these theories are far more elaborate than usual . in the case of @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "the symmetry group is so large that the theory is rendered trivial by it .",
    "quantization schemes that do not take this into account , fail . in @xmath0 dimensions ,",
    "unravelling the symmetry was easy because one has full control of the theory .",
    "the general exact solution of the equations of motion is not only known in closed form , but a good intuitive handle on its meaning is available .",
    "nothing like this occurs in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "learning how to gain a comparable handle is the task at hand .",
    "it is obviously a difficult task .",
    "we will never have the general solution of the einstein equations in four dimensions in closed form . that may prevent us from ever getting the kind of intuitive handle on the theory that is needed in order to quantize it .",
    "the non - perturbative quantization of gravity was pioneered by dewitt in the 60 s , following the early efforts of dirac and bergmann .",
    "an immediate problem that was encountered is that the kind of variables in terms of which gravity is usually described , is very different from the ones used in the successful quantum field theories of particle physics . in the latter ,",
    "the fundamental variable is a connection .",
    "this made many of the techniques that had been developed for handling particle physics theory not applicable to general relativity .",
    "a change in this situation occurred when ashtekar introduced a formulation of general relativity in terms of a connection that had a very elegant and simple canonical structure .",
    "in fact , the theory resembled a yang ",
    "mills theory and opened the possibility of introducing the techniques so successfully used in that context to general relativity .",
    "these lectures will give glimpses onto some of the results that have arisen ever since .",
    "these notes are based on lectures . due to the finite lecture time ( further compressed by a two day plane delay ! ) and lack of expertise of the author in some areas it was not possible to cover many topics . a big , broad topic i missed is spin foam approaches to the path integral .",
    "this will be covered soon by a forthcoming review paper by perez @xcite .",
    "i will not discuss the beautiful results on black hole entropy .",
    "these are of great importance , since they are precise calculations that do not shy away from taking into account the full dynamics of the theory .",
    "the paper by ashtekar et al .",
    "@xcite has references to all the early literature .",
    "very recent work by varadarajan @xcite and others @xcite , showing a connection between the loop representation and more traditional fock pictures and the work of thiemann s group @xcite on semi - classical states could not be covered .",
    "the beauty of these results requires a level of detail that was not possible in the format of the lectures . finally ,",
    "although the notes attempt to guide a newcomer to the literature , they have not been prepared carefully enough as to attempt to be a comprehensive review .",
    "loll @xcite , rovelli @xcite and thiemann @xciteliving reviews articles covering lattice approaches , loop quantization and canonical quantum gravity respectively .",
    "carlip @xcite has a superb review on quantum gravity in general , giving the essentials of all approaches . for a lighter reading , smolin s @xcite recent",
    "book covers several aspects of quantum gravity .",
    "detailed discussion of the early results are found in ashtekar s books @xcite , other topics can also be seen in the book we wrote with gambini @xcite .",
    "baez and muniain have an introductory book to knot theory with applications to gravity @xcite .",
    "canonical quantization is the oldest and most conservative approach to quantization .",
    "it demands one to control the theory well , not allowing to bypass several detailed questions , namely what is the space of states of the theory , what is the inner product , what is observable .",
    "every physicist has performed a few canonical quantizations in courses on quantum mechanics .",
    "to canonically quantize one roughly follows the following steps : a ) one picks a poisson algebra of classical quantities that is large enough to span the physics of interest ( in ordinary mechanics @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for instance ) ; b ) one represents these quantities as operators acting on a space of wavefunctions and the poisson algebra as an algebra of commutators ; c ) if the theory has constraints , that is , quantities that vanish identically classically , one has to impose that they vanish quantum mechanically as operators ; d ) an inner product has to be introduced on the space of wavefunctions that are annihilated by the constraints ; e ) predictions for the expectation values of observables ( quantities that have vanishing poisson brackets with the constraints ) can be worked out .",
    "notice that several of these steps involve choices .",
    "for instance , there is no unique way to choose an inner product , or to choose a certain set of classical quantities to be promoted to operators .    for general relativity",
    "one has to start by casting the theory in a canonical form .",
    "this was done by dirac and bergmann in the 50 s and 60 s ( for a more modern discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental canonical variable is the metric of a spatial surface @xmath4 ( people normally use @xmath2 instead of @xmath5 to avoid confusion with the space - time metric ) .",
    "its canonically conjugate momenta is usually denoted @xmath6 and the tilde denotes that it is a density , as momenta usually are .",
    "the momenta are closely related to the extrinsic curvature , which is also closely related to the time derivative of the three metric .",
    "the theory has four constraints .",
    "these are relationships among the variables at a given instant of time .",
    "three of them form a vector and are called the `` vector '' or diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "when one has constraints in canonical theories , it is due to the presence of symmetries .",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint can be shown to be associated with the invariance of general relativity under spatial diffeomorphisms .",
    "the remaining constraint is associated with the invariance of general relativity under diffeomorphisms off the spatial surface .",
    "it is usually called the scalar or hamiltonian constraint . unfortunately , the canonical treatment breaks the symmetry between space and time in general relativity and the resulting algebra of constraints is not the algebra of four diffeomorphisms , the hamiltonian constraint is singled out and behaves differently .",
    "the algebra of constraints is closed in the sense that poisson brackets of constraints are proportional to constraints , but the poisson bracket of two hamiltonian constraints is proportional to a diffeomorphism constraint through a function of the canonical variables .",
    "this we will see , will cause difficulties at the time of quantization .",
    "if one performs a legendre transform one finds that the hamiltonian of general relativity is just a combination of the above mentioned constraints .",
    "that is , the hamiltonian of the theory vanishes .",
    "this is due to the fact that the notion of time introduced in order to set up the canonical theory is a fiducial , arbitrarily introduced time .",
    "the canonical formalism `` knows '' that relativity does not really single out a preferred time and responds back by saying that the hamiltonian associated with any artificial time vanishes .",
    "physical time can only be retrieved in the canonical theory through an elaborate process with many difficulties ( kucha s @xcite article contains a detailed discussion of the `` problem of time '' )    one can attempt a canonical quantization by considering wavefunctions of the metric @xmath7 . one can represent the metric as a multiplicative operator and its canonically conjugate momentum as a functional derivative .",
    "one can then attempt to promote the constraints to operatorial equations .",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint , which is linear in the momenta , is relatively simple to implement .",
    "it implies that the wavefunctions are really only functions of the diffeomorphism invariant content of @xmath2 and not of @xmath2 itself .",
    "this is natural and elegant , but is also problematic : we do not know how to code in a simple way the diffeomorphism invariant information of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore the solution to constraint presented is natural but also quite formal ; we can not write it or handle it in an explicit way .",
    "a worse situation arises when one considers the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the latter is a non - polynomial function of the canonical variables that requires regularization .",
    "most regularizations used in particle physics depend on the presence of a background ( c - number ) metric , which we do not have available in quantum gravity .",
    "no satisfactory treatment of the hamiltonian constraint in this context has ever been found .",
    "worse , the lack of control on the space of functions considered also implies that we do not know any kind of useful inner product to be introduced .",
    "finally , in the last step we were supposed to compute expectation values of the observables ( see @xcite for references on the observables problem ) of the theory .",
    "observables have to be quantities that have vanishing poisson brackets with the constraints .",
    "this implies they are invariants under the symmetries of the theory and that as quantum expressions they will act upon the space of physical states ( solutions to the constraints ) in such a way as to keep us within that space .",
    "unfortunately no such quantities are known for general relativity in a generic situation .",
    "if one reduces the theory by introducing additional symmetries , sometimes observables can be found .",
    "for instance in cosmological models or if the space - times considered are asymptotically flat .",
    "what is happening here is that since the hamiltonian of the theory is a combination of constraints , finding observables is tantamount to finding the constants of motion of the theory .",
    "but the constants of motion can be seen as re - expressing the initial conditions for a given solution of the equations of motion as functions of phase space .",
    "this , of course , requires solving the equations of motion , something we can not do for general relativity in closed form , unless we have symmetries present .",
    "this has suggested the possibility that the problem could perhaps be tackled in an approximate form .",
    "progress has been recently made on this issue in the new variable context as well @xcite .",
    "the introduction of ashtekar s new variables generated the new momentum that has invigorated the field in the last 18 years . for pedagogical reasons ,",
    "the new variables are best introduced in a two stage process .",
    "the first stage is to use , instead of the metric of space as a fundamental variable , a set of triads @xmath8 ( the tilde denotes a density weight , introduced for convenience , @xmath9 is a spatial index and @xmath10 labels the three frame fields ) .",
    "people had considered using the triad as a canonical variable .",
    "the description closest to the notation used in these days is given by barbero @xcite .",
    "extra constraints arise since the theory is now invariant under frame field transformations ( rotations ) as well .",
    "the hamiltonian is still a complicated non - polynomial function of the canonical variables .",
    "so the introduction of triads per se is not too helpful .",
    "the real breakthrough was the realization by ashtekar that the sen @xcite connection could be used as a canonically conjugate momentum to the triad .",
    "usually the canonically conjugate momentum considered for the triad is proportional to the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the sen connection adds a piece given by the spin connection of the triad .",
    "actually the sum of these two terms can be done while multiplying the extrinsic curvature times a constant ( this constant is called the immirzi parameter ) , yielding a one - parameter family of possible canonically conjugate variables ( all members of the family are related by a canonical transformation ) .",
    "we call this the generalized sen connection .",
    "if one rewrites the constraints in terms of the triads and the generalized sen connection several things happen .",
    "the set of constraints introduced due to the symmetry of the theory under triad rotations now takes the form of `` divergence of the triad equal zero '' .",
    "the divergence is taken with respect to the generalized sen connection .",
    "if one writes the connection as @xmath11 and the triads as @xmath12 the resulting equation is exactly a gauss law @xmath13 , like the one present in @xmath14 yang  mills theory ( the @xmath14 arises due to the symmetry under rotations of the triads ) .",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint takes a form that resembles a poynting vector @xmath15 .",
    "this is nice , since the latter is clearly associated with the momentum of the fields and fields without net linear momentum are the only ones invariant under diffeomorphisms .",
    "finally the hamiltonian constraint still is a complicated non - polynomial function of the variables .",
    "however , if one chooses the immirzi parameter equal to the imaginary unit ( this is if one considers a lorentzian signature space - time , for an euclidean signature the immirzi parameter should be chosen equal to one ) , the non - polynomialities cancel out .",
    "one is left with a hamiltonian constraint that takes a simple , polynomial ( in fact at most quadratic ) form in terms of the canonical variables @xmath16 .",
    "another appealing aspect is that written in terms of these new variables , general relativity appears as a yang ",
    "mills theory with a set of extra constraints ( and with a different hamiltonian ) .",
    "this opened the possibility of introducing in general relativity tools that were used in yang ",
    "mills theory for its quantization .",
    "one of these tools is the use of loops .",
    "we could now attempt a canonical quantization of the theory we just discussed .",
    "one could pick wavefunctions that are functionals of the connection @xmath17 $ ] just like in yang ",
    "mills theory and promote the connection and the triad to canonically conjugate operators .",
    "notice that this is already quite a departure from the traditional quantization where one took functionals of the metric .",
    "one now has to impose the constraints as operator equations .",
    "the gauss law as an operator just demands that the wavefunctions be @xmath14 invariant ( gauge invariant in the yang ",
    "mills language ) .",
    "an interesting set of gauge invariant functionals of the connection is given by considering the trace of the holonomy of the connection along a loop .",
    "@xmath18 these quantities are called `` wilson loops '' .",
    "a very attractive feature is that these quantities constitute a basis for all gauge invariant functions @xcite .",
    "that is , given any gauge invariant function of a connection it can in principle be expressed as a linear combination of wilson loops based on different loops .",
    "the coefficients of this expansion therefore contain all the gauge invariant information of the wavefunction .",
    "therefore whenever we think of a gauge invariant functional of a connection @xmath17 $ ] one can alternatively think of the coefficients @xmath19 of its expansion in the wilson loop basis ( @xmath20 is a loop ) . representing the functions in this way is what is known as the `` loop representation '' . in this",
    "representation wavefunctions are functions of loops and operators are geometric operators that act on loops . such representation was first proposed for yang  mills theory by gambini and trias @xcite and for general relativity in terms of the new variables by rovelli and smolin @xcite .",
    "a caveat is that the basis provided by wilson loops is really an overcomplete basis .",
    "the coefficients in the expansion @xmath19 are therefore constrained by certain relations , known as the mandelstam identities @xcite . for a function of a loop to be admissible as a wavefunction in the loop representation",
    ", it should satisfy these identities .",
    "this can be challenging to achieve .",
    "as we will see a solution to this problem was eventually found in terms of spin networks .    since one is automatically considering gauge invariant functions only when one works in the loop representation , gauss law identically vanishes .",
    "we are therefore left with the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints only .",
    "the beauty of the loop representation lies in the natural action the diffeomorphism constraint acquires in this representation .",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint acts on wavefunctions by shifting infinitesimally the loop .",
    "therefore it is immediate to solve the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "one simply has to consider wavefunctions of loops such that they are invariant under deformations of the loops .",
    "such functions are studied by the branch of mathematics called knot theory and are known as knot invariants .",
    "we therefore see that we can solve the diffeomorphism constraint in terms of a set of functions on which there is a lot of mathematical knowledge .",
    "a further surprise that the loop representation yielded was that it appeared to also help in solving the hamiltonian constraint @xcite .",
    "in retrospect , this result appears as of quite limited importance , but it provided a quite significant boost of interest in the subject at the time it was found , so we will review it here .",
    "let us go back briefly to the connection representation .",
    "suppose we want to promote the hamiltonian constraint to a quantum operator .",
    "we choose a factor ordering such that the triads are to the right .",
    "one needs to regularize the operator .",
    "let us choose a simple minded point splitting , putting the two triads and the curvature at slightly different points .",
    "the triads operating on the wilson loop produce a result that is proportional to the tangent to the loop at the point where they act ( one can see this simply by noting that it is the only vector present at that point ) .",
    "that means that the two functional derivatives , viewed as a tensor , produce as a result a symmetric tensor , since the result is proportional to a vector times itself .",
    "this tensor is contracted with @xmath21 , which is antisymmetric .",
    "therefore the result vanishes . notice that this result does not depend on the details of the regularization .",
    "this result was first noticed by jacobson and smolin @xcite .",
    "one caveat is that for it to be true , the loops in question have to be smooth . if a loop is not smooth , it contains points where there is more than one tangent and the constraint is not automatically zero , since the two functional derivatives could be proportional to different vectors and do not yield a symmetric tensor anymore .",
    "if we now go back to the loop representation , the previous result suggests that if we consider knot invariants @xmath19 that have support on smooth loops only , one would appear to solve all the constraints of quantum gravity .",
    "this result by rovelli and smolin @xcite generated a lot of excitement .",
    "but there are problems in attempting to solve the constraints in such a way .",
    "first of all , generic knot invariants with support on smooth loops only fail to satisfy the mandelstam identities .",
    "this can be fixed by using spin networks as we will see later . but more importantly",
    ", smooth loops appear to be too simple to carry interesting physics .",
    "as we will see , operators like the volume of space vanish identically unless one has intersections .",
    "therefore this space of solutions of the constraints is very likely a `` degenerate '' subspace that is not large enough to do meaningful physics .",
    "it was however , of great historical importance .",
    "another early result of interest in the loop representation was based on an observation due to kodama @xcite .",
    "the observation is that if one considers the exponential of the integral over space of the chern ",
    "simons form built from the sen connection @xmath22\\right)$ ] , it automatically solves the hamiltonian constraint in the connection representation if one introduces a cosmological constant .",
    "the cosmological constant produces an extra terms in the hamiltonian of the form @xmath23 . to see that the kodama state solves the constraint we only need to know that when one acts with @xmath24 on it , one gets something proportional to @xmath25",
    "; this one can see through a calculation . to put it in simpler terms , for this state `` @xmath26 , '' that is the triad is proportional to the magnetic field built from the sen connection .",
    "therefore the two terms in the hamiltonian constraint , which can be schematically written as `` @xmath27 '' can be made to cancel each other by a choice of the constant @xmath28 in the kodama state .",
    "the kodama state has been found to have connection , in the cosmological context , with the hartle  hawking and vilenkin vacua @xcite .",
    "of interest as well is its expression in the loop representation . to transform this state to the loop representation we wish to find its expansion in the basis of wilson loops , that is , the coefficients ,",
    "@xmath29 this integral has been extensively studied in a different context , that of chern ",
    "simons theory @xcite . that is ,",
    "consider a theory whose action is @xmath30 .",
    "then the integral can be viewed as the computation of the expectation value of the wilson loop in a chern  simons theory .",
    "the result is a function of a loop that is diffeomorphism invariant , that is , it is a knot invariant .",
    "this invariant is the kauffman bracket , which is closely related to the jones polynomial , a knot invariant of great interest in the mathematical literature .",
    "since this invariant is the transform of a state that is annihilated by the hamiltonian constraint in the connection representation , it should be annihilated by the hamiltonian constraint in the loop representation .",
    "this has been checked explicitly @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that this invariant from the mathematical literature , which was developed in completely independent fashion from any idea related to the gravitational field , manages to solve the quantum einstein equations .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , the early years after the introduction of the new variables and the loop representation were ripe with intriguing and promising results , that appeared to be a significant step forward in the construction of a canonical theory of quantum gravity . however , many of the results were of formal nature only .",
    "there was not a good control on the space of states that one was operating on . here",
    "we will mention some formal developments that took place in the mid 90 s that helped gain better control on the calculations being performed .      as we discussed before ,",
    "wilson loops are an overcomplete basis for gauge invariant functions .",
    "they are constrained by a set of nonlinear identities called mandelstam identities .",
    "the simplest such identity comes from the following identity of @xmath31 matrices in the fundamental representation @xmath32 . in terms of wilson loops",
    "this would read @xmath33 with @xmath34 denoting loop composition .",
    "now , it is clear that these identities stem from the fact that we are working in the fundamental representation of @xmath31 to construct the wilson loops .",
    "one does not need to do so .",
    "consider a diagram like the one in the figure .",
    "one could construct holonomies along all the links in the diagram , in principle , with different representations of @xmath31 on each link ( the representations are labeled by an integer ) . at each of the vertices",
    "one would use invariant tensors in the group to `` tie up '' the holonomies in such a way as to have at the end of the process a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "such a quantity is a natural generalization of the wilson loop .",
    "the diagrams like the one in the figure are called spin networks . since the invariants so constructed do not depend on any particular representation , there are no relations between them as when we were working in the fundamental representation only",
    ". therefore the mandelstam identities are automatically solved .",
    "this was first realized by rovelli and smolin @xcite .",
    "spin networks also allow to do calculations in a natural and simple way , as we will see in the following sections .",
    "calculations like the ones needed to transform states to the loop representation require a measure of integration in the space of connections modulo gauge transformations .",
    "such integrations are also of interest to construct inner products .",
    "these are really functional integrals in spaces of infinite dimensionality .",
    "there is little experience on how to construct such integrals .",
    "ashtekar and lewandowski @xcite among others have pioneered the construction of measures of integration in such spaces .",
    "they begin by choosing a given set of functions that will be integrable .",
    "the functions chosen are `` cylindrical functions '' .",
    "these are functionals on the infinite dimensional space that really only depend on certain `` directions '' or `` projections '' of the space against a set of schwarz test functions .",
    "the projection is achieved through the use of wilson loops , or even more easily , spin networks .",
    "it might appear that cylindrical functions are too simple to be able to capture interesting physics .",
    "but for the case of a scalar field , for instance , the fock measure can be constructed with cylindrical functions . in the case of spin networks",
    "the resulting measure of integration is really simple , it just states that spin networks are actually an orthogonal basis , ie , @xmath35 where the delta on the right hand side is one if the spin networks are equal or zero otherwise .",
    "the measures constructed are naturally diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "if one considers the class of spin networks related by diffeomorphisms with @xmath36 and the class related with @xmath37 one can construct an inner product on the classes simply by demanding that their inner product be zero if no member of the @xmath36 class coincides with at least one member of the @xmath37 class .",
    "the subject of measures of integration has several mathematical subtleties .",
    "physicists can get a very readable succinct account in the paper by ashtekar , marolf and mourao @xcite .",
    "most quantities of physical interest will involve products of the fundamental fields and therefore will require regularization .",
    "the latter is a non - trivial subject in quantum gravity .",
    "most regularization procedures used in particle physics require the use of metric information . in particle physics",
    "the metric is a c - number .",
    "but this is not the case in gravity .",
    "if one insists in using regularization procedures that involve the metric , one should consider it an operator .",
    "this can complicate quite a bit the task of regularizing expressions .",
    "alternatively , one can introduce an external c - number metric into the formalism , and hope that after one regularizes , there is no trace left of this artificial element in the construction .",
    "it is of interest to notice that some operators of ( limited ) physical interest can indeed be computed that are well defined in spite of the use of regularizations .",
    "these operators represent the area of a surface and the volume of a region of space . at first",
    "it appears that these operators will be difficult to regularize .",
    "the classical expression for the area of a surface @xmath38 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the normal to the surface .",
    "the presence of the square root might at first suggest that regularization will be problematic .",
    "however , partitioning the area in small elements of area one can quickly see that for the quantity inside the square root spin network states are actually eigenstates .",
    "the end result for main portion of the spectrum of the area operator is @xmath41 where the sum is over all links of the spin network that pierce the area and @xmath42 is the valence of the link @xmath43 .",
    "we see that areas are quantized in terms of the planck length squared @xmath44 .",
    "this was first noticed by rovelli and smolin @xcite .",
    "later ashtekar and lewandowski @xcite did a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum of the area operator .",
    "the quantization of the area reveals another surprise .",
    "most people expected areas to be quantized , but the expectation was that the spectrum would be equally spaced , i.e , @xmath45 .",
    "it is not .",
    "this has consequences .",
    "bekenstein and mukhanov @xcite have shown that assuming that the spectrum of the area is equally spaced has serious implications for the validity of the thermal spectra of black holes .",
    "rovelli and collaborators @xcite have shown that these problems can be solved by considering the correct spectrum .",
    "for the volume operator results are quite similar .",
    "the volume operator acting on a spin network gives a nonzero result if within the region considered there are intersections of valence equal or larger than four .",
    "one gets a picture of spin networks in which each links carries `` quanta of area '' and each intersection of valence four or larger carries `` quanta of volume '' .",
    "both operators are finite and well defined without reference to any background metric structure in spite of the fact that they had to be regularized .",
    "several calculations of the spectrum of the volume can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that one can not really discuss any physics emerging from quantum gravity until one has dealt with the hamiltonian constraint . attempting to do so would be equivalent to trying to do physics after handling two of the three components of gauss law in @xmath31 yang  mills theories .",
    "one can attempt to do some calculations `` at the kinematical level '' ( i.e. ignoring the constraints ) in the hope that some of the basic features of the calculations will persist when the constraints are enforced , but this is not guaranteed .",
    "it is important to preface the discussion of this section with these caveats since they very much apply to what we will discuss .",
    "it took everyone by surprise when amelino - camelia and collaborators @xcite at cern argued that in the detection of gamma ray bursts one could find traces of quantum gravity phenomenology .",
    "for years it had been common lore that quantum gravity required energies so high that it could only have relevant effects in the big bang or inside black holes .",
    "the possibility of detecting quantum gravity effects via gamma ray bursts goes as follows : the gamma rays that arrive on earth have travelled a very long distance , since gamma ray bursts are expected to be cosmological .",
    "that distance appears even larger if one measures in terms of the number of wavelengths of a gamma ray .",
    "if one assumes that when a wave propagates through the `` quantum foam '' each wavelength gets disturbed by an amount of the order of the planck length , then the smallness of this number can be compensated by the huge number of wavelengths involved in traveling from the burst to earth . if one inputs numbers it turns out that detectable dispersions ( differences in times of arrival ) of @xmath46 seconds in gamma rays that differ by @xmath47 as those detected by the batse experiment imply that quantum gravity has to happen at energies larger than @xmath48 in order not to be visible .",
    "this is only three orders of magnitude away from the planck scale !",
    "this led to a lot of interest in these observations .    within loop quantum gravity some calculations",
    "have been performed to attempt to estimate these effects , at a kinematical level @xcite .",
    "the calculations require a number of simplificatory assumptions .",
    "otherwise one would have to deal with einstein - maxwell theory and work out a semiclassical limit .",
    "in general the assumptions have been that the electromagnetic field has been treated classically and only the maxwell part of the hamiltonian constraint is considered .",
    "one finds modified maxwell equations that imply that there is birefringence in the propagation of waves .",
    "similar results can be found for neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the birefringence for photons has been severely constrained experimentally @xcite .",
    "a much more careful recalculation of the effects done recently confirms several of the general features of the original calculations @xcite .",
    "the main problem with these predictions is that in order to have a non - vanishing effect at the lower order in terms of the energy of the gamma rays , one needs to introduce rather unnatural assumptions in terms of the quantum state considered ( otherwise one could not generate a birefringence , which is tantamount to a parity violation ) .",
    "if one does not make these assumptions , then the effects only arise at the next order in @xmath49 and are completely undetectable . in terms of the original work of amelino camelia et al .",
    "they postulated a non - standard dispersion relation of the form @xmath50 and the effects would be observable if @xmath51 is non - vanishing .",
    "a non - vanishing @xmath51 implies a fractional power in a dispersion relation , which is unusual .",
    "more importantly , all these calculations are implying that one is violating lorentz invariance .",
    "this is a huge step to take .",
    "there is significant discussion of the implications in the current literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the initial encouragements that the new variables introduced was that the hamiltonian constraint appears as a polynomial function of the fundamental variables .",
    "this suggested that one could perhaps promote it to a quantum operator and several attempts to regularize it were carried out .",
    "however , there is an obvious fundamental flaw in attempting this .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is quadratic in the triads .",
    "the triads are densities of weight one , meaning that the constraint is a density of weight two . more precisely , the version of the constraint that is nice and polynomial is a density of weight two .",
    "one could turn it into a density of weight one by dividing by the determinant of the metric , but then the resulting operator would be complicated and non - polynomial .",
    "why is it a problem that it is a density of weight two ?",
    "suppose we wished to promote it to an operator in the loop or spin network representation . what could such an operator be",
    "? we have at our disposal a manifold , and a set of lines in it .",
    "we have available a density of weight one , the dirac delta , which is naturally defined on any manifold .",
    "but we do not have a density of weight two .",
    "and we can not multiply dirac deltas . therefore if one found a regularization of the doubly densitized hamiltonian constraint",
    ", what has to be happening is that one provided the extra density weight via the regulator . and",
    "therefore the imprint of the regulator will not disappear upon regularization .",
    "all these difficulties were bridged when thiemann @xcite discovered how to handle the single - densitized hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the expression for the constraint is , @xmath52 and thiemann noticed that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the volume of the three manifold .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint can therefore be written as , @xmath55    when we first discussed the hamiltonian constraint with the new variables , we noted that it was important that we take the immirzi parameter to be the imaginary unit . that made certain non - polynomial terms disappear , but at the price of making the variables complex .",
    "thiemann noted that through a similar use of identities as the one we discussed , these non - polynomial terms could also be reexpressed in terms of poisson brackets .",
    "therefore there is no need anymore of taking the immirzi parameter to be imaginary and from now on one can work with variables that are completely real .",
    "thiemann proposed a quantization for the above mentioned hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the procedure consists in introducing a lattice .",
    "he chooses an irregular lattice ( tetrahedral ) . in terms of this lattice ,",
    "he approximates the expression for the classical hamiltonian constraint using holonomies . omitting many details",
    ", the idea is that the `` @xmath21 '' term is represented by a closed loop going around a triangle on one of the faces of the elementary tetrahedron and the `` @xmath56 '' is represented by a line holonomy that is retraced to recover gauge invariance .",
    "the classical hamiltonian constraint discretized on the lattice is therefore only a function of holonomies and the volume of the manifold .",
    "the attractive aspect of this is that both holonomies and the volume of the manifold can be represented by well defined finite operators in the spin network representation . therefore producing a",
    "well defined , finite hamiltonian constraint is tantamount to `` putting hats on the classical expression '' since all the ingredients can be naturally quantized without divergences !",
    "there are a couple of caveats that need to be noted .",
    "the `` @xmath21 '' can be constructed by many different kinds of elementary loops . as long as they shrink to a point when the lattice is refined they all will represent properly the curvature .",
    "this indicates that there is therefore huge ambiguity in how to define the operator .",
    "an additional ambiguity is the valence of the holonomy that represents the curvature @xcite .",
    "moreover , a crucial element for the hamiltonian to be well defined is that it act on diffeomorphism invariant states . on such states",
    "the details of how the holonomy that represents the curvature is placed with respect to the spin network are immaterial .",
    "this , in turn , ensures that the resulting quantum theory is consistent .",
    "if one acts with two hamiltonian constraints , the two loops added are indistinguishable from each other and therefore if one acts in the opposite order the final result is the same .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint therefore commutes with itself .",
    "now , the classical poisson algebra of constraints stated that the poisson bracket of two hamiltonians should be proportional to a diffeomorphism . if one promotes this to a quantum operatorial expression and acts on diffeomorphism invariant states , the right hand side will give zero since they are annihilated by diffeomorphisms .",
    "therefore the commutator of two hamiltonians should vanish as well @xcite .",
    "thiemann goes on to show that similar constructions can be carried out for general relativity coupled to fundamental matter fields : yang  mills , higgs , fermions @xcite .",
    "this achievement is quite remarkable .",
    "we are in the presence of the first finite , well defined , anomaly - free , non - trivial theory of quantum gravity ever presented .",
    "the theory fulfills the promise of acting as a `` natural regulator of matter fields '' in the sense that no divergences are present when the theory is coupled to matter .",
    "is quantum gravity finally achieved ?",
    "the answer is still not known .",
    "what has been found is a theory ( more precisely infinitely many theories due to the ambiguities ) that are well defined .",
    "although this is no small feat in this context , we do not know if any of these theories contains the correct physics of gravity .",
    "this will only be confirmed or contradicted when a semiclassical approximation is worked out so we can make contact with more familiar results .",
    "active investigations along these lines are being pursued by thiemann and collaborators @xcite and ashtekar and collaborators @xcite .",
    "there are some aspects of thiemann s construction that appear somewhat troubling .",
    "the same construction can be worked out in @xmath0 dimensional gravity @xcite .",
    "if one studies the solutions of the quantum hamiltonian constraint one finds many more states than the ones allowed by witten s theory .",
    "however , if one demands that they be normalized with the inner product we discussed , the witten sector is all that is left .",
    "this can be seen as a positive result ( after all , we get the correct theory ) or as a negative one ( the correct theory only is recovered after choosing carefully an inner product ) .",
    "it appears that in @xmath1 dimensions thiemann s hamiltonian also admits too many solutions .",
    "the fact that the constraint algebra can only be recovered on diffeomorphism invariant states , where it is only abelian , is also troubling .",
    "though again , there is no genuine interest in states that are not diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "other worries were expressed in a paper by smolin @xcite .",
    "the general consensus at the moment is that there appear to be worries that the hamiltonian does not capture the correct physics , but no one can make a theorem out of the worries to prove that thiemann s hamiltonian is wrong .",
    "the verdict will come when further explorations of the semiclassical approximation are worked out .",
    "the idea of exploring quantum gravity effects in the simplified context of cosmological models has held appeal over the years . yet ,",
    "due to the lack of a theory of quantum gravity , the approach taken was rather bizarre .",
    "people would consider general relativity , then reduce the classical theory to only cosmological metrics ( which in the case of homogeneous cosmologies reduces the equations to ordinary differential equations , losing the field theoretical nature of general relativity ) .",
    "the resulting theory was then quantized and some interpretations were attempted .",
    "the main criticism that was levied against this kind of investigations is that `` imposing a symmetry then quantizing '' does not have to agree with `` a sector of the quantum theory with a given symmetry '' .",
    "that is , there is no guarantee that what one sees in quantum cosmology will appear at all when one gets a handle of the full theory and studies cosmological situations .    with thiemann s introduction of viable theories for quantum gravity",
    ", it therefore became ubiquitous to attempt to study quantum cosmology `` properly '' .",
    "that is , study the sector of the full quantum theory of gravity that approximates homogeneous cosmologies .",
    "this is what bojowald @xcite set out to do .",
    "he finds that in isotropic and homogeneous quantum cosmology states reduce to `` spin networks with only one link '' .",
    "this is understandable since everything happens `` at a single point '' in a homogeneous model .",
    "the presence of the link is needed to make sense of the operators involving connections ( one needs more than a point to have a notion of a connection ! ) .",
    "the quantum states therefore are labeled by an integer @xmath57 which corresponds to the valence of the single link of the spin network .",
    "bojowald constructs a version of thiemann s hamiltonian acting on these states .",
    "he also finds a well defined version of the volume operator .",
    "one of the long held beliefs in quantum cosmology is that quantum effects will eliminate the big bang singularity . in bojowald s case",
    "this is actually realized in practice .",
    "considering the case of a flat robertson ",
    "walker metric @xmath58 , he finds that he can find a finite , well defined expression for the operator @xmath59 .",
    "this is done through similar identities as those that led to equation ( [ thiemid ] ) .",
    "since the resulting operator is finite , it suggests that the singularity can be avoided .",
    "remarkably , if one analyzes the relationship of @xmath60 with the volume operator ( which should be @xmath61 such relationship does hold quantum mechanically when the universe is `` large '' .",
    "but when the universe becomes of the size of a few planck volumes , the relationship is broken , the volume goes to zero but @xmath62 remains finite @xcite .",
    "the avoidance of the singularity can be implemented concretely in this approach through discrete equations of motion that actually never become singular . and",
    "the theory can be coupled to various matter sources without introducing singular behaviors through the use of the defined @xmath59 to implement the couplings .",
    "bojowald goes on to introduce a notion of time for these cosmologies .",
    "since everything is discrete , his notion of time is discrete too .",
    "the evolution equations are recursion relations and he shows that for large universes they reproduce the results of usual wheeler - dewitt - based quantum cosmology @xcite . and these evolution equations also allow to evolve non - singularly through the point where one expects the singularity classically .",
    "remarkably , even an argument for inflation being generated by quantum gravity can be found in this context @xcite .",
    "the fact that the cosmological reduction of thiemann s hamiltonian appears to give the correct physics of quantum cosmology is considered by some as an indication that the right physics of gravity is contained .",
    "one should be aware of the fact , however , that bojowald s construction implies a limiting procedure .",
    "quantum states peaked on homogeneous cosmologies are really distributions and therefore one needs to extend the operators defined for other states to them .",
    "this extension is non - trivial and there might be ambiguities in it that allow to `` correct '' things in order to get the right physics .",
    "although this is not what bojowald set out to do , it might have accidentally happened .",
    "moreover , part of the worries about thiemann s hamiltonian have to do with the constraint algebra .",
    "in homogeneous cosmologies , since everything takes place `` at a point '' there is only one hamiltonian constraint that therefore is obviously abelian , which agrees with thiemann s general result .",
    "nevertheless , it is striking that detailed attractive predictions in the cosmological context can be extracted from the proposed hamiltonian constraint .",
    "when we discussed thiemann s hamiltonian constraint we mentioned that he started from a given classical theory in the continuum and introduced a lattice to discretize the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the lattice hamiltonian is then promoted to a quantum operator naturally .",
    "the idea of using lattices to regularize gravity is not new .",
    "the novelty is the use of the recently acquired knowledge about well defined operators and states .",
    "lattice approaches , however , are plagued by difficulties to which thiemann s approach may not be immune .",
    "the difficulty has to do with the fact that in the case of general relativity lattice regularizations breaks the symmetry of the theory under diffeomorphisms ( on the contrary , in the yang  mills case , lattice gauge theory has the advantage of providing a gauge invariant regularization ) .",
    "the theories one gets on the lattice therefore have a considerably different structure than the theory they attempt to approximate in the continuum .",
    "it is the personal impression of the author that at the time of quantizing the discrete theories , one needs to take their structure seriously .",
    "in particular , most discrete approximations that one constructs for general relativity , end up being inconsistent ( their equations do not admit a single solution ) .",
    "this is well known , for instance , in numerical relativity .",
    "when one wishes to integrate the einstein equations on a computer , they are approximated by finite difference equations .",
    "whereas in the continuum theory if one solves the constraint equations initially , the evolution equations guarantee the constraints will hold at all time , this is not true of the discrete equations .",
    "there is therefore no way to satisfy simultaneously the constraint equations ( at all times ) and the evolution equations .",
    "most people in numerical relativity use `` free evolution '' that is , they accept that they will fail to satisfy the constraints at later times as part of the numerical error of the solution they incur",
    ".    in quantization the last argument does not work .",
    "if a theory is inconsistent , there is little sense in attempting a quantization .",
    "most attempts to lattice quantum gravity suffer from this problem .",
    "for instance , when one discretizes the hamiltonian constraint , the discrete constraints fail to close an algebra ( this is reasonable , since algebras are associated with infinitesimal symmetries and nothing can be infinitesimal in a discrete theory ) .",
    "if the constraints do not close an algebra one can generate further constraints by taking poisson brackets .",
    "if one is not careful one ends up with too many constraints and the theory has no solutions .",
    "this is the canonical manifestation of the inconsistency .",
    "these kind of problems are very basic and are even present in very simple systems .",
    "for instance , if one considers a newtonian particle and discretizes newton s equations , it is a well known fact that energy fails to be conserved .",
    "in fact astronomers who wish to follow planetary motion have known this for a long time and construct special discretizations of newton s laws that automatically conserve energy and angular momentum .",
    "our goal is to find something similar in the gravitational context , that is , a discretization scheme that automatically preserves the constraints .",
    "lee @xcite proposed a way to fix the problems of the newtonian particle that can be easily translated to the gravitational case .",
    "the idea consists in enforcing the constraints through a suitable choice of lagrange multipliers . in the case of general relativity ,",
    "one chooses the lapse and shift in such a way that in the next step the constraints are satisfied .",
    "this has no counterpart in the continuum theory .",
    "one has four constraints to enforce and four quantities to solve for ( the equations to be solved are coupled algebraic non - linear equations ) .",
    "we have recently worked out @xcite the canonical theory for such consistent discretizations and applied it to yang  mills and bf theory and presented the prescription for the gravitational case . in this approach , since the constraints are automatically satisfied , most of the conceptually hard problems that arose due to attempting to impose the constraints disappear . quantum gravity become a conceptually clear yet computationally challenging problem .",
    "there are many attractive features in this approach .",
    "since the initial data fixes the lapse and the shift , and quantum mechanically one generically has a superposition of initial data , one automatically has a superposition of discretizations .",
    "the goal of `` averaging out '' over all discretizations is implemented naturally .",
    "we have applied these ideas to a cosmological model .",
    "classically one finds that if one runs the model backwards , unless one fine tunes the initial data , no singularity is present .",
    "this is natural , generically the singular point will not fall on the lattice .",
    "when one quantizes however , the fact that the singularity classically only occurs for a set of measure zero in the possible initial data implies that the singularity is not present .",
    "we see a remarkable agreement with bojowald s prediction , although the details and motivation are different .",
    "much more will have to be explored to see if the consistent discretizations are a viable route for quantization .",
    "in particular we have little experience with the complicated non - linear equations that fix the lapse and the shift .",
    "what if they quickly generate negative lapses or singularities ?",
    "it is imperative that experience be gained , particularly in midi - superspace examples where there are field theoretic degrees of freedom .",
    "even these cases are computationally challenging given the complexity of the algebraic non - linear coupled equations that determine the lapse and the shift .",
    "the last 18 years have seen a renaissance of canonical quantum gravity .",
    "the field has been brought to a complete new level in terms of mathematical sophistication and possibilities for discussing physical consequences and applications .",
    "it is becoming more evident by the day that not only it is not clear that general relativity has a problem at the time of its quantization , but that actually the quantization of einstein s theory has a lot to teach us about physics .",
    "this physics might be of interest just in the context of pure general relativity or in the context of proposed unified theories of all interactions , like string theory",
