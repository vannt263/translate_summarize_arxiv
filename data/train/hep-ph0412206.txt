    "in this talk some results following from the covariant quark - parton model ( qpm ) will be shortly discussed , details of the model can be found in our recent papers@xcite @xcite @xcite . in this version of qpm valence quarks",
    "are considered as quasifree fermions on mass shell .",
    "momenta distributions describing the quark intrinsic motion have spherical symmetry corresponding to the constraint @xmath0 , which represents the total angular momentum - generally consisting of spin and orbital parts .",
    "i shall mention the following items :    \\1 . what sum rules follow from this approach for the spin structure functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 ?",
    ". how can these structure functions be obtained from the valence quark distributions @xmath4 and @xmath5 - if the @xmath6 symmetry is assumed ?",
    "why the first moment @xmath7 calculated in this approach can be substantially less , than the corresponding moment calculated within the standard , non covariant qpm , which is based on the infinite momentum frame ?",
    "calculation of the transversity distribution .",
    "the model is based on the set of distribution functions @xmath8 , which measure probability to find a quark in the state:@xmath9where@xmath10 coincides with the direction of the proton polarization @xmath11",
    ". correspondingly , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are quark mass and momentum , similarly @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the proton .",
    "*  * with the use of these distribution functions one can define the function @xmath16 , which in the target rest frame reads:@xmath17 in the previous study it was shown@xcite , how the spin structure functions can be obtained from the generic function @xmath16 . if one assume @xmath18 then:@xmath19@xmath20let me remark , that procedure for obtaining the functions @xmath21 from the distribution @xmath16 is rather complex , nevertheless the task is well - defined and unambiguous . for the transversity the corresponding expression reads@xmath22where the factor",
    "@xmath23 depends on the approach applied in the calculation@xcite .",
    "one can observe , that the functions above have the same general form@xmath24and differ only in kinematic term @xmath25 .",
    "this integral , due to spheric symmetry and presence of the @xmath26function term , can be expressed as a combination of the momenta : @xmath27one can prove@xcite , that these functions satisfy@xmath28this relation then gives possibility to obtain integral relations between different functions having form ( [ s2 ] ) or ( [ s1 ] ) , in particular for @xmath29 and @xmath30 one gets for @xmath31 :    @xmath32@xmath33another rule , which is obtained in this approach , reads:@xmath34 dx=0,\\]]which is valid for _ any _ @xmath35 , for which the integral exists . for @xmath36",
    "the relation corresponds to the wanzura - wilczek sum rules@xcite .",
    "other special cases correspond to the burkhardt - cottingham@xcite ( @xmath37 ) and the efremov - leader - teryaevelt ( elt , @xmath38 ) sum rules . for the transversity one gets@xmath39",
    "now i shall apply the suggested approach to the description of the real proton . for simplicity",
    "i assume :    \\1 ) spin contribution from the sea of quark - antiquark pairs and gluons can be neglected , so the proton spin is generated only by the valence quarks .",
    "the negligible contribution from the quark sea was recently reported in@xcite .",
    "\\2 ) in accordance with the non - relativistic _",
    "su(6 ) _ approach , the spin contribution of individual valence terms is given by the fractions:@xmath40if the symbols @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote momenta distributions of the valence quarks in the proton rest frame , which are normalized as@xmath43then the generic distribution ( [ t4 ] ) reads@xmath44    in the paper@xcite , using a similar approach ,",
    "i studied also the unpolarized structure functions .",
    "structure function @xmath45 can be expressed as@xmath46on the other hand , for proton valence quarks one can write@xmath47so combination of the last two relations gives:@xmath48since this is again the integral having the structure ( [ s1 ] ) , one can apply the technique of integral transforms and ( instead of relations between @xmath49 ) obtain the relations between @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for @xmath31 these relations read : @xmath52@xmath53@xmath54where @xmath55 is corresponding @xmath56 factor .",
    "now , taking quark charges and the @xmath56 factors as in eq .",
    "( [ t71 ] ) , one can directly calculate @xmath21 and @xmath57  only using the input on the valence quark distributions @xmath58 .",
    "more detailed discussion of obtained results is done in our cited papers . here",
    "i mention our ( a.efremov , o.teryaev and p.zavada ) quite recent result on double spin asymmetry @xmath59 , which is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fgr1 ] ) .",
    "calculation is done in an accordance with the recent study@xcite , but with the use of quark trasversities obtained in the presented approach , which gives slightly lower estimation of the @xmath60 .",
    "it is expected , that this function could be accessible in the pax experiment@xcite , which will measure spin asymmetry of the lepton pairs produced in collisions of transversely polarized  protons and antiprotons .",
    "further , in this talk i want concentrate on the discussion and explanation , why intrinsic quark motion substantially reduces the first moment of the spin function @xmath2 .",
    "i have shown@xcite , that    @xmath61    which , in the @xmath56 approach gives@xmath62where left limit is valid for the static and right one for massless quarks . in other words , it seems : @xmath63all right , this is a mathematical result , but how to understand it from the point of view of physics ?    first ,",
    "forget structure functions for a while and calculate completely another task .",
    "let me remind general rules concerning angular momentum in quantum mechanics :    \\1 ) angular momentum consist of orbital and spin part : * j = l+s *    \\2 ) in the relativistic case * l * and * s * are not conserved separately , only total angular momentum * j * is conserved .",
    "so , one can have pure states of @xmath64 only , which are for fermions with @xmath65 represented by the relativistic spheric waves@xcite :    @xmath66@xmath67this wavefunction is simplified for the state with total angular momentum ( spin ) equal 1/2 :    @xmath68@xmath69which gives@xmath70let me remark , that @xmath71 is minimum angular momentum for particle with @xmath72 now , one can easily calculate the average contribution of the spin operator to the total angular momentum :    @xmath73@xmath74\\]]if @xmath75 is the probability amplitude of the state @xmath76 , then @xmath77which means , that :    _ i ) _ for the fermion at rest ( @xmath78 ) we have @xmath79 which is quite comprehensible , since without kinetic energy no orbital momentum can be generated .",

    "in which @xmath80 , we have in general : @xmath81where left limit is valid for the energetic ( or massless ) fermion , @xmath82 . in other words , in the states @xmath76 with @xmath83 part of the total angular momentum @xmath71 is _ necessarily _ created by orbital momentum .",
    "this is a simple consequence of quantum mechanics .",
    "now , one can compare integrals ( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) . since both integrals involve the same kinematic term , the interpretation of dependence on ratio @xmath84 in ( [ v2 ] ) is valid also for ( [ v1 ] )",
    ". otherwise , the comparison is a rigorous illustration of the statement , that @xmath85 measures contributions from quark spins ( and not their total angular momenta ) .",

    "in particular , the momenta @xmath7 corresponding to the static ( massive ) fermions and massless fermions , can differ significantly : @xmath86 .",
    "it is due to splitting of angular momentum into spin and orbital part , as soon as intrinsic motion is present .",
