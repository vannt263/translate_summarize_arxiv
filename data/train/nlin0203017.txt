    ", the coexistence of several attractors and multistability enables such systems to act as memory devices @xcite , an idea first suggested by ikeda and matsumoto @xcite . on the other ,",
    "the study of delay systems is motivated by the fact that these systems exhibit high - dimensional chaos and therefore can be used in communication systems based on chaotic synchronization , to securely encrypt information into their chaotic outputs @xcite .",
    "several authors have recently shown the existence of two different regimes of synchronization in nonidentical coupled time - delayed differential equations , in a master - slave configuration @xcite .",
    "when the master and the slave systems have both the same amount of delayed intrinsic feedback and the delay time @xmath3 is the same for both systems , the slave system variables synchronize with the master system variables with a lag time that is equal to the delay of the coupling , @xmath4 . in other words , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the states of the master and slave systems respectively .    on the other hand ,",
    "when the master and the slave systems have the same amount of delayed intrinsic feedback and the feedback coefficient of the master system is equal to the sum of the feedback coefficient of the slave system and the coupling coefficient , the systems synchronize with a different lag - time . in this case @xmath8 .",
    "two synchronization regimes are therefore possible for appropriate choices of the slave map parameters , as shown analytically in specific instances @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that these two synchronization regimes can also occur in time - discrete dynamical systems . in section 2",
    "we consider generic nonidentical delayed maps , unidirectionally coupled , and define the two synchronization regimes . as an illustration , in section 3 we analyze logistic and hnon delayed maps .",
    "finally , section 4 presents our conclusions .",
    "we consider a generic master map of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are parameters .",
    "the slave map is given by @xmath12    if the parameters of the slave map are tuned in such a way that @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( case i ) , the slave map reduces to @xmath15 . \\label{lag1}\\ ] ] full synchronization can be expected for sufficiently large @xmath16 on the synchronization manifold @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",

    "therefore , depending on the parameters of the slave map , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , full synchronization can take place with two different lag times , @xmath24 in the case of eq .",

    "the actual possibility of observing full synchronization in either case is determined by the stability of the synchronized state .",

    "equation ( [ delta ] ) can be formally integrated by introducing a linear @xmath34-dimensional map , with @xmath35 , for a variable @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "this equivalent map is given by @xmath38 where the elements of the matrix @xmath39 are given by the ( time - dependent ) coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) @xcite .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) reads @xmath40 so that the state of full synchronization is linearly stable if all the eigenvalues of the evolution matrix @xmath41 vanish for @xmath42 .",

    "note that all the elements of matrix @xmath39 , given by the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) , involve a delay @xmath1 which thus acts as a uniform time shift .",
    "this fact implies that , in the limit @xmath43 , the eigenvalues of @xmath41 become independent of @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the value of @xmath1 is irrelevant to the stability of full synchronization ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note carefully that , generally , full synchronization for the two cases considered above will be stable on two different ranges of the coupling constant @xmath16 .",
    "if the master map is chaotic , we expect that for sufficiently small and large @xmath16 full synchronization is unstable and stable in both cases , respectively , while for intermediate values only one of the cases admits full synchronization .",
    "we have seen above that full synchronization is possible at two points in the ( @xmath22,@xmath23 ) parameter space , with different lag times in each case . to encounter such synchronized states ,",
    "the slave - map parameters must be exactly tuned on one of those synchronization points .",
    "their location is schematically shown in fig .",
    "though when the slave system is slightly detuned with respect to the synchronization points full synchronization will not occur , it is expected that the slave - map orbit follows approximately the master - map orbit with the same lag time , @xmath44 or @xmath45 . to quantitatively characterize the degree of synchronization between the two orbits and the respective lag time",

    "the evolution of the master coordinates @xmath90 is given by the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 , so that the master system is @xmath93 cf . eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) . in the following",
    "we choose @xmath94 .",
    "the slave system , with coordinates @xmath95 , is governed by the equations @xmath96 so that coupling acts on the first coordinate only .",
    "the synchronization manifold is given by @xmath97 where , as before , @xmath29 in case i and @xmath30 in case ii .",
    "next we study in which regions of parameters the different synchronization regimes occur .",
    "we take parameters for the master map @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath0 such that its dynamics is chaotic .",
    "figure 4 displays the minimum of the similarity function and the lag - time for which the minimum occurs , in the parameter space ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the results are similar to those found with the logistic map . for weak coupling the synchronization regions",
    "are not well defined , but as the coupling increases their size grows and the boundary between them becomes well defined . for large @xmath16 both synchronization regimes",
    "are stable .",
    "thus , it can be though that a small variation of the slave map parameters @xmath22 or @xmath23 near the boundary region might induce a transition from synchronization with lag - time @xmath44 to synchronization with lag - time @xmath45 or viceversa .",
    "however , near the boundary region we find @xmath99 , which indicates bad synchronization .",
    "therefore , while the lag - time at which the minimum value of @xmath46 occurs changes abruptly ( from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ) , there is no sharp transition between one regime of synchronization to the other .",
    "if the slave map parameters are gradually modified from point i to point ii , synchronization with lag - time @xmath100 is gradually lost , and as we enter the region ii , synchronization with lag - time @xmath45 is gradually established .",
    "we have studied two regimes of synchronization of delayed nonidentical maps .",
    "we have shown analytically that , by suitably tuning the slave map parameters , two distinct synchronization regimes can occur . in one regime the lag time between the slave and the master maps is given by the delay of the coupling , @xmath1 , while in the other regime is given by the difference between the delays , @xmath2 .",
    "we have also shown that these two regimes are actually two particular cases of synchronization with a slave map that is identical to the master map but that has two delayed feedback terms .",
    "the two synchronization regimes has been exemplified by considering delayed logistic and hnon maps . in both cases ,",
    "the synchronization regimes are simultaneously stable only for large values of the coupling @xmath16 , and therefore , they occur at parameters of the slave map , ( @xmath22,@xmath23 ) , which are far away from each other . in other words ,",
    "our results show that in the case of delayed logistic and hnon maps , a small variation of a parameter of the slave map can not induce a transition from regime i to regime ii or viceversa , since they occur in distant regions of the parameter space . on the contrary , in the case of semiconductor lasers with optical feedback",
    ", it has been shown numerically @xcite that close to the lasing threshold , by carefully tuning a parameter of the slave laser one can induce a transition from one regime of synchronization to the other .",
    "it will be interesting to study a delayed map which shows this type of transition , and allows an analytical investigation of the phenomenon .",
