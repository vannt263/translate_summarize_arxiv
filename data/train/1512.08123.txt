    "higgs mechanism generates mass to gauge bosons with respecting the gauge invariance based on the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "it plays the crucial role in the standard model @xcite .",
    "the mechanism predicts existence of a particle , so called higgs boson .",
    "the experimental search for the boson has been carried out for a long time . recently a new boson has been discovered at large hadron collider ( lhc ) by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite .",
    "the measured properties of the discovered boson is consistent with the higgs boson assumed in the standard model @xcite .",
    "other new particles expected beyond the standard models have not been observed yet at lhc .",
    "the scalar sector assumed in the standard model seems to effectively work well , at least up to tev region even if the scalar sector is described by something more fundamental one at high energies .",
    "however , there are some theoretical problems in the scalar sector , for example , the quadratic divergence in the quantum correction to the mass of the scalar field and its naturalness @xcite , the stability of the scalar potential at high energy scale @xcite .",
    "hence it is a good time to consider the scalar sector again based on a different point of view and to see a different aspect of the scalar sector .",
    "it is more instructive to start from a similar system described by an anharmonic potential in the classical mechanics .",
    "we suppose one - dimensional motion of a point particle with a mass @xmath0 , in the following anharmonic potential @xmath1 the potential is stable at @xmath2 .",
    "its classical solution is known as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is jacobian elliptic - function with an argument @xmath5 and a modulus @xmath6 . substituting the above function - form into the equation of motion ( eom )",
    ", we obtain the time frequency @xmath7 and the modulus @xmath6 as @xmath8 , @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the above solution describes a non - trivial oscillation allowed by eom , i.e. , elliptic oscillation around the stable point @xmath11 and satisfies the initial condition @xmath12 .",
    "the above @xmath13-type oscillation describes the behavior for @xmath14 .",
    "the form of the oscillation changes to @xmath15-type oscillation with a different frequency and a modules for @xmath16 , and it changes to @xmath17-type oscillation for @xmath18 .",
    "the `` center of the oscillation '' is @xmath11 for @xmath19 while it changes to the origin for @xmath20 .",
    "if the initial point @xmath21 is larger than @xmath22 , then the point particle has enough energy to climb up the potential wall towards the other stable point .",
    "the last @xmath17-type oscillation describes this case and _ the other two _ @xmath23-type oscillations show non - trivial and classical oscillations allowed by eom around the stable point , @xmath11 .    in the quantum mechanics or quantum field theories , according to the path integral formalism , the classical solution realized as a special path with fixed initial and final points gives stationary of the action .",
    "the quantum effect can be introduced as a fluctuation around the classical path .",
    "the classical solution dominates the path integral .",
    "therefore it is interesting to study an application of this elliptically oscillating solution to a self - interacting scalar field with higgs potential in the standard model .    in the standard perturbation we introduce the quantum field",
    "@xmath24 as the excitation around the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath11 , as @xmath25 .",
    "if we take into account both a classical component @xmath26 and a quantum field @xmath27 with vev , @xmath11 , for example , @xmath28 , such a perturbation method contains a non - trivial nature of the potential ( we call it higgs potential in this paper ) , and it may reveal a new aspect of the scalar sector . if the classical behavior plays an important role in a physical system , such an analysis should be adopted .",
    "recently the elliptic solution and its phenomenological effects are actually considered with the higgs potential @xcite .",
    "the idea to embed the elliptic oscillating solution in the quantum field theory is worthy to consider again .",
    "we push forward the idea to naturally formulate the quantum field theory in the context of the analogues of the classical theory .",
    "we note that the elliptic function is applied many phenomena and the effects of the anharmonic potential is evaluated for a different purpose , for example , see ref .",

    "we consider the following model lagrangian to extract a non - trivial classical behavior : @xmath29 where this lagrangian has @xmath30 symmetry @xmath31 .",
    "the stationary condition , @xmath32 , determines the stable ground state , i. e. vacuum , at @xmath33 . to simplify our discussion",
    "we do not consider couplings between the scalar @xmath34 and other particles like fermions , gauge bosons , or other different scalars .",
    "if we introduce the gauge field , the brout - englert - higgs mechanism @xcite can generates the gauge boson mass under the potential @xmath35 .",
    "thus we call the potential as the higgs potential .    in the original lagrangian",
    "the mass of the field @xmath36 seems to be tachyonic .",
    "we usually shift the field @xmath36 to describe the excitation around the vacuum @xmath11 as @xmath37 and rewrite the lagrangian in terms of the new field @xmath38 , then we obtain @xmath39 where the mass of the field @xmath24 is real and given by @xmath40 . the @xmath30 symmetry , @xmath41 , no longer holds for the new field , @xmath42 , hence the symmetry is spontaneously broken , alternatively hidden by the vacuum as known well .",
    "we consider the solution of eom @xmath43 in the original field , @xmath34 , it reads @xmath44 since it is not easy to find the general solution of this non - linear differential equation , we focus on the elliptically oscillating solution motivated by the analogue of the classical mechanics .",
    "according to the approach developed in @xcite , the solution can be obtained by assuming the following description @xmath45 where @xmath46 is jacobian elliptic function , @xmath47 denotes a constant parameter with the mass - dimension one and it will be regarded as an initial value of the field @xmath34 at a particular point , @xmath48 is the four momentum of the classical solution , @xmath6 is called as the modulus of this elliptic function , @xmath49 is an integration constant which does not affect our discussion .",
    "these parameters are determined later to satisfy eom .    by using the chain rule of the derivative and mathematical formula of the elliptic functions @xmath50 ( see @xcite ) and substituting eq .",

    "if we consider the case @xmath54 , then we can determine @xmath47 in this case as @xmath55 , due to the identity @xmath56 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath47 coincides with the vev , @xmath57 , which is the constant solution of eom and it gives the minimum of the higgs potential . since the field , @xmath24 , vanishes for @xmath54 , we focus on the other case ( @xmath58 ) to obtain a non - trivial result . for @xmath58",
    "we obtain @xmath59 we can convert the solution of @xmath34 to that of @xmath24 as @xmath60 .",
    "it is notable that the modulus @xmath6 can become imaginary ( i.e. negative @xmath61 ) for @xmath62 .",
    "we discuss the possible parameter - space of the parameter , @xmath47 , which is related to the initial condition @xmath63 and @xmath64 . here",
    "we assume a non - trivial field value ( @xmath65 ) as the initial condition and set @xmath66 , @xmath67 . in principle one can consider a more general case @xmath68 .",
    "thanks to the mathematical nature of the elliptic functions for different modulus @xmath6 , the solution is categorized into the following three regions for @xmath61 ; @xmath69 .",
    "we introduce a dimensionless parameter , @xmath71 , which helps us to classify the parameter - space of @xmath47 .",
    "the condition @xmath72 is equivalent to @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in this case",
    "the solution is rewritten as @xmath75 to rewrite the solution we used gauss transformation @xmath76 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the solution has a property of the elliptic oscillation described by the function , @xmath15 . besides it is notable that @xmath36 does not have the infinite value for arbitrary space - time points due to the property of non - zero behavior of @xmath13 function .",
    "this behavior guaranties non - zero and finite field - value around the vacuum for arbitrary space - time points .",

    "the condition , @xmath84 , is equivalent to @xmath85 and @xmath86 and we obtain @xmath87 this case shows a good behavior to guarantee non - zero and finite field - value around the vacuum as well as the previous @xmath15-type - solution .",

    "the condition , @xmath91 , is equivalent to @xmath92 and @xmath93 and we rewrite the solution as @xmath94 where we used jacobi s transformation @xmath95 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this case has the physically `` worse '' behavior which can not guarantee non - zero and finite field - value for arbitrary space - time points , contrary to the previous two cases .",
    "the elliptic function , @xmath96 , becomes zero periodically with a certain oscillation period .",
    "here we impose three conditions ( global excitation , closed excitation , vacuum stability ) for the expected classical behavior , namely :    1 .",
    "the solution should have a non - trivial and global excitation over whole space - time , 2 .",
    "the solution should be defined on a bounded interval , 3 .",
    "the bounded interval should contain the true vacuum .",
    "the 1st condition requires that the classical solution should not localize in a particular space - time point , i.e. , not instanton - like .",
    "the 2nd condition guarantees a periodic `` oscillation '' , i.e. , anharmonic oscillation allowed in the non - linear eom .",
    "the 3rd condition requires a stability of the vacuum , i.e. , the oscillation should not be bound around the false vacuum .",
