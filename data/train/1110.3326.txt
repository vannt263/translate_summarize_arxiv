    "we would like to be able to determine directly how much growth occurs in supermassive black holes in the early universe .",
    "unfortunately , however , only the most luminous quasars at @xmath10 have ever been detected individually ( e.g. , fan et al .",
    "2006 ; willott et al .  2010 ; mortlock et al .",
    "2011 ) , and these sources are so massive that their evolutionary histories are far from typical .",
    "we would also like to know the relative contributions of the galaxy and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) populations to the uv and x - ray ionizing radiation in the early universe .",
    "estimates from optical data were that agns could not account for the required uv ionizing flux at @xmath11 ( e.g. , bolton et al .",
    "2005 ; meiksin 2005 ) .",
    "it is now recognized that complete samples of agns  or at least those which are not compton thick  are most easily obtained with x - ray observations .",
    "direct searches for high - redshift ( @xmath12 ) agns carried out using combined deep _",
    "chandra _ x - ray samples and optical imaging data ( e.g. , barger et al .  2003 ; fontanot et al .",
    "2007 ) also found that the ionization from agns was insufficient to maintain the observed ionization of the intergalactic medium at high redshifts .",
    "this result was conclusively established at @xmath11 by cowie et al .",
    "( 2009 ) by measuring the contribution of agns to the ionizing flux as a function of redshift using x - ray , optical , and uv observations .",
    "however , even if the space - density of high - redshift , unobscured agns is not sufficiently high to reionize the universe , it does not rule out the possibility that substantial accretion onto supermassive black holes is occurring behind veils of obscuring material .",
    "the only way to determine this is by probing the faintest x - ray fluxes .",
    "thus , the continued deepening of the deepest x - ray images of the sky is essential for studying this important issue .",
    "the latest of these deepenings is the now nearly 4  ms of exposure on the _ chandra _ deep field - south ( cdf - s ; giaconni et al .",

    "the 4  ms exposure is deep enough to detect all sources above a luminosity of @xmath13  erg  s@xmath4 in the rest - frame @xmath14  kev band at @xmath15 .",
    "thus , almost all luminous agns , even at very high redshifts , will be included in the catalog of directly detected sources .",
    "however , only one source with a redshift greater than @xmath16 has been spectroscopically identified ( barger et al .",
    "2003 ) in the _ chandra _ deep field - north ( cdf - n ; brandt et al .  2001 ; a03 ) and cdf - s fields .",
    "fainter sources are likely to be dominated by star formation , low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) , or highly obscured agns .",
    "such sources should have strong breaks in the rest - frame uv owing to the ly@xmath17 forest of the intergalactic gas or to the intrinsic lyman continuum break and should be included in optical or near - infrared dropout samples identified from the break properties .",
    "we can attempt to measure the properties of these fainter sources through averaging ( sometimes referred to as `` stacking '' ) analyses of optically or near - infrared selected galaxy samples ( e.g. , brandt et al .",

    "hickox & markevitch 2006 , 2007 ; treister et al .",
    "this is of particular interest for the highest redshift samples , where we may be probing supermassive black holes at times very close to their formation .",
    "however , it also allows us to examine the x - ray properties of star - forming galaxies over a wide range in redshifts ( out to beyond @xmath18 ) and to test whether the properties of these galaxies change with time .",
    "treister et al .  (",
    "2011 ; hereafter t11 ) used the cdf - n and cdf - s data to perform sensitive x - ray stacking analyses on @xmath10 galaxy candidates that could not be detected individually to look for detectable x - ray signal from the population as a whole .",
    "the high - redshift samples they used ( @xmath19 from bouwens et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter bo06 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 from bouwens et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter bo11 ) were selected with the drop - out technique using _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ acs and wfc3 data .",
    "for the @xmath19 bo06 sample , t11 found significant detections ( @xmath22 ) in both the observed soft ( @xmath1  kev ) and the observed hard ( @xmath23  kev ) bands .",
    "the stacked hard - to - soft x - ray flux ratio that they found was a relatively high factor of @xmath24 , which they said could only be explained by very high levels of obscuration . moreover , since the ratio was a ratio of the stacks , they inferred that there must be very few sources with significantly lower levels of obscuration .",
    "this led them to the conclusion that black holes grow significantly at early times but are heavily buried in gas and dust .",
    "these results are rather surprising .",
    "galaxies selected by the drop - out technique are generally classic starburst galaxies ; i.e. , they are small , blue , and compact with high surface brightnesses ( e.g. , stanway et al .  2004 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the masses of local supermassive black holes are generally correlated with the bulge luminosities of the host galaxies ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; tremaine et al .  2002 ) .",
    "at @xmath25 , this would be akin to finding agns in lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , which is not very common ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "2004 ) . moreover , if there were a lot of gas and dust present to obscure the central black hole ( t11 argue that the sources must be nearly compton - thick along most directions ) , then one might expect the dust to also affect the properties of the host galaxy , unless it were somehow confined to the region around the agn itself .    indeed , fiore et al .",

    "more recently , willott ( 2011 ) provided an independent critique of t11 that parallels some of the results of the present paper .    here",
    "we argue that the t11 result is a consequence of an incorrect background subtraction procedure . in our analysis",
    "we find a @xmath26 upper limit on the x - ray luminosity at @xmath6 of @xmath7  erg  s@xmath4 , which is consistent with any x - ray production in the galaxies being solely due to star formation .    at lower redshifts",
    "we find significant weighted mean x - ray fluxes in many samples of sources over the redshift range @xmath9 .",
    "we use these to argue that ( 1 ) the relation between star formation and x - ray production remains invariant over this redshift range , ( 2 ) x - ray sources below the direct detection threshold are primarily star - forming , and ( 3 ) there is full consistency between uv and x - ray estimations of the star formation history .",

    "x11 presented the x - ray images from the 3.872  ms total exposure of the cdf - s , which covers an area of 464.5  arcmin@xmath30 .",
    "they provided a main _ chandra _ source catalog containing 740 x - ray sources detected with wavdetect at a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath31 in at least one of three x - ray bands : full ( @xmath32  kev ) , soft ( @xmath1  kev ) , and hard ( @xmath23  kev ) .",
    "the catalog also satisfies a binomial - probability source - selection criterion of @xmath33 , which means that the probability that the sources not are real is less than 0.004 .",

    "a fully optimally weighted determination of the mean x - ray flux in a sample from the _ chandra _ data would involve using variable elliptical apertures that are dynamically adjusted to match the local psfs and background .",

    "even at these small off - axis angles the optimal weighting of the _ chandra _ data involves several issues , most particularly which aperture to choose and how far out in off - axis angle to include sources ( e.g. , lehmer et al .",

    "we show this quantity for the @xmath23  kev band in figure  [ sn_figure ] as a function of @xmath58 ( black solid : @xmath59 or on - axis ; red : @xmath60 ; blue : @xmath61 ; green : @xmath62 ; black dashed : @xmath63 ) and @xmath55 , assuming @xmath48 is roughly constant within the region . as t11 point out",
    ", the optimal @xmath55 to maximize the s / n increases with increasing @xmath58 , rising from @xmath64 at @xmath65 ( black solid ) to approximately @xmath66 at @xmath67 ( black dashed ) .",
    "however , as can also be seen from figure  [ sn_figure ] , the dependence on @xmath55 at larger @xmath58 is very soft , so choosing a smaller aperture radius has little effect on the s / n .",
    "moreover , using a smaller aperture radius has the advantage of minimizing contamination by neighboring sources .",
    "a very small aperture is optimal close to on - axis , but the use of such a small aperture places stress on the astrometry ( see t11 ) .",
    "we have therefore chosen to use a constant @xmath68 aperture within an off - axis angle of @xmath69 and a constant @xmath70 aperture at larger @xmath58 .",
    "this roughly brackets the optimal radius for @xmath69 ( see blue curve in figure  [ sn_figure ] for the @xmath23  kev band ) , namely @xmath71 in the @xmath1  kev band and @xmath72 in the @xmath23  kev band .",
    "the noise in typical samples computed with this procedure only differs from that computed with a fully optimized aperture as a function of radius by a few percent .",
    "we include sources out to @xmath73 , which , in conjunction with the samples lying within the well covered areas of the goods fields , is our definition of the core region .",
    "we stress that the results are quite insensitive to the choice of the maximum @xmath58 , because the high off - axis sources have low s / n in an optimally weighted mean . decreasing",
    "the off - axis angle at which we include sources to @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) would raise the noise in typical samples by 5% ( 15% ) .",

    "@xmath80 may be negative or positive .",
    "we take the error on this quantity to be @xmath81 , since , in general , the number of background counts in the aperture , @xmath82 , is high enough to justify the gaussian approximation .    for a given sample we form the optimally weighted mean x - ray counts  s@xmath4 , @xmath83 , and the corresponding error , @xmath84 . to do this",
    ", we first exclude all sources with a known x - ray source within @xmath85 or a bright ( @xmath32  kev counts above 1000 ) x - ray source within @xmath86 in the existing catalogs ( x11 for the cdf - s and a03 for the cdf - n ) to remove any contamination from these sources .",
    "these two values ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) correspond to the 90% and 95% enclosed light radii , respectively , at an energy of 5  kev and an off - axis radius of @xmath45 .",
    "this ensures that the contribution from the extended wings of the known sources is less than about a count in any aperture , even for the hard band . when averaged over the ensembles , this level of contamination is negligible .",
    "our contamination radii are smaller than the values adopted by hickox & markevitch ( 2006 , 2007 ) or by t11 , but tests with random samples show that there is little sensitivity to increasing them , and choosing the smallest possible contamination radii minimizes the number of sources excluded by this step .",
    "the adopted procedure reduces the core area from 101  arcmin@xmath30 to 86  arcmin@xmath30 .",
    "we form the optimally weighted mean x - ray counts  s@xmath4 , @xmath87 , by summing over the remaining sources in the sample .",
    "the corresponding error is @xmath88 .",
    "the final issue is how to compute the background counts per unit solid angle , @xmath48 .",
    "there are two possible approaches to this .",
    "one can compute a local background for each source using either a surrounding annulus ( t11 ) or a wavelet approach ( hickox & markevitch 2006 , 2007 ) , or one can compute the average background by randomizing the positions of the sources and measuring the values obtained in the blank - field apertures generated ( e.g. , lehmer et al .  2005 ) . here",
    "we use both procedures : we use annular measurements as our primary background determination , and then we use randomized position measurements to test that the procedure is not introducing offsets .    before we continue , we note that the background we are measuring is composed of several elements : an approximately uniform instrumental background , a truly diffuse component containing contributions from hot interstellar or intergalactic gas , and contributions from individual sources below the direct detection threshold of the deep cdf images . while a local estimate of the background contributions from the instrument and the diffuse background should provide a good average measure , such estimates could be more problematic for the unresolved sources , which may be clustered . clustering",
    "could , in principle , result in an underestimate in determining the background subtraction , since the annulus in which the background is measured lies further from the source than the aperture in which the signal is measured .",
    "however , in practice , the surface density of x - ray sources at a given redshift is small , and the average contribution of these sources to the background is also small .",
    "( contributions from sources at other redshifts may be viewed as random with respect to the sources whose signal is being measured . )    we may use the results of section  [ photzsamp ] to estimate that the total contribution of all the sources in our photometric redshift sample is approximately 2% of the observed background in the cdf - s . in smaller redshift intervals , these contributions are correspondingly less and drop rapidly with increasing redshift ( see section  [ discuss ] ) . thus , the redshift interval from @xmath89 produces about 0.001 of the background , and that at @xmath90 produces less than 0.0003 of the background .",
    "these contributions are too small for clustering in the galaxy population to perturb the background in any significant way .    in determining @xmath48",
    ", we use an annulus of radius @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "this choice of inner boundary avoids any contribution from the target , and this choice of outer boundary provides a large enough number of pixels . in order to eliminate any contribution to @xmath48 from bright neighboring sources ,",
    "we exclude @xmath85 regions around known sources ( @xmath86 regions around very bright sources ) , and we clip pixels with high counts .",
    "considerable caution must be taken in performing the clip .",
    "because the average number of counts in each pixel is small , the counts distribution is poissonian .",
    "too severe of a clip can introduce a downward bias in the estimation of the average background in the annulus , which would result in a spurious signal when that background is subtracted from the counts in the aperture .",
    "this appears to be the cause of the @xmath19 weighted mean signal found by t11 .",
    "2.5 cm     to test both the present procedure and the t11 procedure , we ran 100 realizations of randomly located apertures in the goods - s core region for a sample with a size equal to that of the bo06 sample of @xmath19 galaxies . in figure  [ counts_hist ] we show the two distributions of the @xmath23  kev counts  s@xmath4 , @xmath80 , that we measured . in one case we clipped the background pixels above 2 counts ( red dashed curve ; this corresponds to the t11 procedure ) , while in the other case we only clipped the background pixels above 4 counts ( blue dashed curve ; present procedure ) .",
    "the more severe clipping ( red ) produces a systematic offset in the measured counts , while the less severe clipping ( blue ) does not .",
    "the 4 counts clip used in the present paper is the most stringent clip possible that does not produce a significant offset .",
    "however , we note that the results are not sensitive to choosing higher values for the clipping .",
    "we can see this offset even more clearly when we plot the two distributions of weighted mean @xmath23  kev counts  s@xmath4 , @xmath83 .",
    "( red solid for the t11 procedure ; blue solid for the present procedure . )",
    "the offset of the red solid histogram ( @xmath93 counts  s@xmath4 ) is almost identical to the weighted mean signal found by t11 for the bo06 sample ( downward pointing arrow ) .",
    "in contrast , the offset of the blue solid histogram ( @xmath94 counts  s@xmath4 ) is consistent with the zero weighted mean signal expected for random realizations if the background subtraction is correct .",

    "we can more directly constrain any evolution in @xmath154 as a function of redshift by comparing how the x - ray flux depends on the uv flux as a function of redshift . since the star formation histories , particularly at the highest redshifts , are generally computed from extinction corrected uv luminosity densities ,",
    "this is the most direct test we can make .    for each galaxy in the goods - s core region with a photometric redshift",

    "this only affects the high flux bins ( @xmath165  )@xmath166  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 ) . retaining in the averaging procedure the directly detected low x - ray luminosity ( @xmath167  erg  s@xmath4 ) sources in the x11 catalog , as in figure  [ xray_uv](c )",
    ", extends the relation for the low - redshift sources to higher fluxes .",
    "the underlying reason for the linear relation between the x - ray flux and @xmath165   ) is the linear relation between the x - ray flux and the sfr .",
    "however , since the conversion from the uv flux to a total sfr requires an extinction correction , it also shows that the average extinction correction is similar for all sources regardless of the near - uv flux .",
    "second , there is little variation in the normalization with redshift . for the full data set we find @xmath168 ( black solid line ) .",
