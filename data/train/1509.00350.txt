    "we present a detailed study of the hi  in ngc  3079 and in its environment .",
    "ngc 3079 is well - known for its intense starburst in the central regions and an associated outflow of ionised gas , while it also harbours a seyfert nucleus .",
    "although it has been the target of many detailed studies , we have obtained new hi  data that are much more sensitive than those from previous observations with the aim to do a more detailed study of the role of the environment in the elevated activity in this galaxy and , vice versa , the effect of ngc 3079 on it companion galaxies .",
    "ngc  3079 is a nearby spiral galaxy which has been studied extensively in different wavelengths and resolutions because it is known for its several unique properties .",
    "one of the most spectacular features of ngc 3079 is the ionised gas outflow ( super - wind ) forming a  super - bubble \" at the eastern side of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the outflow appears to originate from the nucleus and reaches velocities up to @xmath0 1500 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2@xcite .",
    "chandra x - ray observations also show a clear correspondence between x - ray emission and the optical h@xmath3 filaments extending @xmath0 1.3 kpc from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "large - scale outflows have also been observed in the radio continuum as two , kpc - scale , radio lobes extending on both sides of the major axis of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "ngc  3079 is classified as seyfert 2 @xcite or liner ( low ionization narrow emission line region , @xcite ) .    the  super - bubble \" can be caused by either an agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or a nuclear starburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , various studies of the nucleus of the galaxy have provided evidence for the presence of both a weak agn and a nuclear starburst .",
    "several x - ray observations provide compelling evidence for the existence of an obscured agn .",
    "for instance , the presence of an x - ray continuum excess in the @xmath4 kev band and a 6.4 kev fe k@xmath5 line emission @xcite , and the detection of both soft and hard x - ray emission showing a high hydrogen column density ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) towards the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the presence of an agn is also indirectly supported by very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of @xcite at 5 ghz which revealed aligned multiple - components a , b and c ( along p.a.@xmath8 ) consistent with a pc - scale nuclear radio jet .",
    "this was later supported by several high resolution radio continuum observations @xcite .",
    "these high resolution observations also revealed additional components ( e and f ) to the central vlbi source with varying spectral indices .",
    "although the additional components have similar orientation and spacing as the components detected by @xcite , they are not aligned with either the kpc - scale radio lobe or the proposed pc - scale jet @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also suggested that the jet may exist with a pc - scale wide angle outflow , which goes to show that the central source is far more complex than reported in @xcite .",
    "strong fir emission @xcite , colour excess @xcite , and unusually high - density core of molecular gas relative to other starburst galaxies or agn ( @xmath07200 @xmath9pc@xmath10 ; @xcite ) all point towards a nuclear starburst ( but see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for counter - arguments ) ) .",
    "previous vla hi  observations of ngc 3079 by @xcite showed a smooth disk of hi  with however some signs of perturbation , e.g.  in the southern part .",
    "one of the main aims of our study is to investigate whether deeper hi  observations would provide further evidence for such perturbations and whether these may be related to the activity observed in ngc 3079 .",
    "@xcite detected hi  and hydroxyl ( oh ) multi - component absorptions towards the centre .",
    "the results from these observations suggest a combination of rotation and gas outflow to be present in the nuclear region @xcite .",
    "the second aim of our work is , exploiting the high spectral stability of the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) , to see whether deeper observations would provide more information about this outflow of cold gas .",
    "ngc 3079 is seen edge - on ( @xmath11 ; @xcite ) and is at a distance of @xmath0 16 mpc ( i.e.  1 arcsec = 85 pc ) .",
    "ngc  3079 has two known nearby companion galaxies , ngc  3073 ( dwarf s0 ) and mcg  9 - 17 - 9 ( small sb - sc ) .",
    "the optical appearances of both companions do not show any disturbance .",
    "however in hi , ngc  3073 appears to be affected by the nuclear activity in ngc  3079 @xcite .",
    "this is observed as an elongated hi  tail coming from ngc  3073 pointing away from the nucleus of ngc  3079 in the data from @xcite .",
    "interestingly , as @xcite argue , this tail may be caused by ram - pressure stripping of hi  from ngc 3073 by the starburst - driven superwind of ngc 3079 .",
    "our deeper hi  data allow us to study this tail in more detail .",
    "our observations and the results are presented in sections [ s : reduction ] and [ s : result ] followed by discussion in sections 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "ngc  3079 was observed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) .",
    "five 12-hr observations were performed on 4 , 5 , 9 , 12 and 28 jan 2004 .",

    "the improved sensitivity of the new data highlights the more extended hi  distribution resulting in @xmath025% more hi  detected compared to what reported by @xcite .",
    "this difference is particularly due to the much larger extent of the galaxy west of ngc 3079 in the new data .",
    "several new hi  extensions and plumes of emission are also visible to the south - west and north - east .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the previous data the galaxy appeared more extended towards the east than to the west , while our deeper observations now show that the reverse is true and the hi  is much more extended to the west , in the direction of mcg 9 - 17 - 9 .",

    "although the outer contours in the channel maps look disturbed , the extended gas still shares the disk kinematics ( e.g. , @xmath24 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the more likely source of the disturbance is an interaction between the two galaxies ( see fig .",

    "the position - velocity diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ f : abspv ] shows the absorption as blue contours . the deep part of the absorption profile exhibits a multiple - component structure with a mixture of broad and narrow components , consistent with what found by previous studies at higher resolution @xcite .",
    "the strongest absorption extends in velocity from @xmath0850 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2  to @xmath01440 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "the peak optical depth is high , @xmath25 , even when assuming that the absorption is observed against the entire continuum source in the inner region ( i.e.  the covering factor @xmath26 ) .",

    "their detected hi  absorption covers a similar velocity range and shows an even higher optical depth , suggesting that the covering factor for our data is not unity and that the absorbing screen is concentrated in the nuclear regions ( i.e.   not in front of the diffuse continuum emission which is included in the relatively large central beam of our observations ) . @xcite identified three distinct absorption components associated with the nuclear disk , the inner and the outer disk structures .",
    ".,width=302 ]    although our observations can not provide a comparable spatial resolution , the sensitivity and bandwidth of our data have allowed us to explore the presence of hi  ( in absorption ) not part of a regularly rotating structure .",
    "in addition to the deep absorption covering the range of rotation velocities of the hi  emission , we detect a faint , additional component that covers a velocity range between @xmath0450 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2  and 800 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2 , well outside the velocity range of the regularly rotating disk . at the extreme velocities",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : abs ] .",
    "interestingly , evidence for a blueshifted hi   component was also reported by @xcite based on their vla observations .",
    "the kinematics of the gas producing this shallow component is not consistent with gas in a simple rotating disk , rather it indicates the presence of outflowing gas . since both starburst winds and agn",
    "are known to be able to drive outflows , the superwind or the sub - arcsec radio jet might power such this outflow in this galaxy .",
    "both mechanisms are discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : outflow ] .",
    "this broad and shallow component has a maximum depth of @xmath00.35 mjy .",
    "broad and shallow absorption components can be the result of errors in calibration caused by , for example , temporal instability of the bandpass of the telescope . in order to exclude this possibility ,",
    "the stability of the bandpass was carefully verified by investigating whether similar broad features appear in the spectra of the calibrators when the bandpass derived from one calibrator observed before ngc 3079 was applied to a calibrator observation taken after the science observation .",
    "in this way we find that the level of instrumental variation of the bandpass is a factor ten below what would be needed to explain the faint absorption component , which implies that the broad absorption is not an instrumental effect .",
    "we can estimate the parameters of the broad absorption . if we assume that this component is observed against the peak of the continuum , its optical depth is @xmath29 . because there is a large uncertainty when using higher resolution data due to the variability of the core radio flux density reported in some observations ( e.g. ,",

    "this gives us as lower limit of @xmath32 cm @xmath10 ( for @xmath28 = 100 k and covering factor @xmath26 ) .",
    "it might well be that , if the absorbing gas is located close to the centre of ngc 3079 , that the spin temperature of the gas is well above the 100 k assumed here and that these column densities have to be increased accordingly .      figure [ f : cont ] shows the continuum image of ngc  3079 overlaid onto the optical dss2 red image .",
    "the continuum structure of ngc  3079 has been well studied at various resolutions and frequencies @xcite . at high spatial resolution ,",
    "it shows two radio lobes ( extending about 2 kpc from the nucleus ) extending perpendicularly to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "these relatively large , extended radio lobes , likely connected to the nuclear outflow , are quite unusual for seyfert galaxies . on larger scales",
    ", @xcite found that the radio continuum follows the galaxy disk .",
    "this emission is surrounded by a radio halo ( extending at least 4.8 kpc from the disk ) together with other extension / loops particularly clear at low frequencies .    at the resolution of our observation",
    "( @xmath131 kpc ) , we see some indication for the nuclear lobes in the form of small extension perpendicular to the disk , although these can not be well separated from the extended disk emission .",

    "the disk emission extends to radii similar to what observed by @xcite .",
    "one outcome from our radio continuum data is that the halo appears asymmetric , with the emission on the w side being more extended than on the e. on the e side , the extent is about 5 kpc while on the s - w side it reaches about 7 kpc .",
    "this extension to the s - w side was also seen in the 1.2  ghz image from @xcite , while the remaining emission looks smoother ( and larger ) in our image .",

    "moreover , a tidal encounter often leads to two arms , one leading and one trailing , while here we observe only one arm . that tidal effects are not the dominant origin of the hi  bridge is reinforced from an estimate of the tidal radius of mgc 9 - 17 - 9 .",
    "the radius @xmath44 beyond which matter is tidally stripped due to an interaction between two galaxies can be estimated using @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the mass of the satellite , @xmath47 the mass of the main galaxy and @xmath48 the projected separation between the two ( @xcite ) .",
    "the un - equality is due to the fact that the projected separation gives a lower limit to the true separation .    the ratio of the masses of the two galaxies we estimate from their rotation velocities and their relative sizes . for the rotation velocity at the edge of the regular hi  disk of ngc 3079 ( @xmath05 arcmin = 23.3 kpc radius )",
    "we find 200 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2  ( see fig .",
    "[ f : abspv ] ) while for mcg 9 - 17 - 9 we find 40 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2  at a radius of @xmath00.7 arcmin = 3.3 kpc .",
    "this gives a mass ratio of 166 .",
    "the projected separation between the two galaxies is 33 kpc .    using these values in eq .",
    "1 gives a tidal radius of @xmath49 kpc , larger than the radius of the regular , unaffected disk of mcg 9 - 17 - 9 .",
    "however , this estimate is not very much larger than the size of the disk of mcg 9 - 17 - 9 and it might well be that , e.g.  during those phases of the encounter between where the satellite may have been closer to ngc 3079 , tidal effects have played some role .",
    "the distortion of the outer disk of ngc 3079 also points to this .",
    "however , given that the bridge connects to mcg 9 - 17 - 9 , the formation of the bridge seems to be still ongoing and , given the estimated tidal radius , it is unlikely that tidal effects are the main reason for the hi  stream near mcg 9 - 17 - 9 .",
    "another scenario is that the hi  bridge is caused by ram pressure stripping of hi  from mcg 9 - 17 - 9 by the halo of hot gas ngc 3079 is known to posses @xcite .",
    "the gas in a galactic disk is stripped if the the ram pressure of the hot halo gas is greater than the restoring gravitational force per unit area of the galaxy s disk @xcite .",
    "the density of the hot gas , @xmath50 , required for stripping gas at a disk radius @xmath48 can be estimated , assuming a gas disk sitting in a uniform spherical stellar / dark matter system , from @xmath51 where @xmath52 is surface mass density of the gas disk , @xmath53 the rotational velocity , @xmath54 the velocity of the galaxy through the hot halo , and @xmath48 the radius of the disk under consideration @xcite .    from the total hi  image",
    ", we see that the disk of mcg 9 - 17 - 9 appears disturbed for column densities below @xmath55 @xmath7 at a radius @xmath48 of 3.3 kpc . for the rotation velocity we use , as before , 40 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2 , while for the velocity @xmath54 of the galaxy w.r.t .",
    "the hot medium we assume 200 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2 , somewhat larger than the observed velocity difference between ngc 3079 and mcg 9 - 17 - 9 .",
    "this gives us an estimate for the density of the hot gas required for ram pressure stripping to occur at the column density level and radius observed of @xmath56 @xmath57 .",
    "this value should be compared with estimates of the density of the hot halo of ngc 3079 .",
    "an extensive x - ray halo , with a luminosity of @xmath58 erg  s@xmath2 and a temperature of @xmath59 k , has been detected around ngc  3079 ( rosat ; @xcite , chandra ; @xcite ) .",
    "from the parameters derived for an exponential distribution of the hot gas ( well - fit ) by @xcite , we get , for the location of mcg 9 - 17 - 9 , an observed density of @xmath60 @xmath57 , where @xmath61 is a volume filling factor .",
    "a very similar density was derived by @xcite for the hot halo of ngc 3079 assuming a simple spherical distribution .",
    "these densities are quite close to that required for ram pressure to occurring at the column density and radius we observe the hi  disk of mcg 9 - 17 - 9 to be affected .    from the above analysis of both tidal and ram - pressure stripping , we conclude that the stripping that is currently occurring for mcg 9 - 17 - 9 is mainly due to the interaction with the halo of hot gas known to surround ngc 3079 .",
    "the observed densities of the halo match quite well the estimated required densities for the stripping to occur at the observed column densities and radius .",
    "the estimated tidal radius is larger than the size of the disk of mcg 9 - 17 - 9 .",
    "however , the difference is not very large and it is conceivable that , during an earlier phase of the encounter where possibly mcg 9 - 17 - 9 was closer to ngc 3079 , tidal effects may have been important .",
    "the distorted outer hi  disk of ngc 3079 also suggest that this is the case .",
    "the ` cometary ' appearance of the hi  in ngc  3073 was first observed and discussed by @xcite .",
    "our deeper data reveal that the hi  tail of ngc 3073 is not only more extended , but also that it appears to be composed of two tails superimposed ( fig .  [",
    "f : tail ] ) .",
    "irwin et al .",
    "discuss the interesting possibility that this tail of ngc 3073 is due to ram - pressure stripping by the fast star - formation driven wind coming from the central regions of ngc 3079 .",
    "this possibility was also discussed by @xcite .",
    "before we discuss this option in more detail , we first consider the alternatives of tidal effects and ram - pressure stripping by the hot halo of ngc 3079 .",
    "the first option can likely be excluded . in the previous section we showed that tidal effects are currently not very strong for mcg 9 - 17 - 9 and there are a number of reasons why for ngc 3073 this is even more the case . in the first place because the distance between ngc 3079 and ngc 3073 is likely to be larger , given the larger projected separation of 50 kpc .",
    "moreover , ngc 3073 is more massive than mcg 9 - 17 - 9 , reducing the tidal impact of ngc 3079 . using the results from @xcite",
    ", we estimate the rotation velocity of ngc 3073 to be 86 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2 , compared to 40 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2  for mcg 9 - 17 - 9 . taking this together , we find that the tidal radius for ngc 3073 is likely to be larger than about 17 kpc , which is much larger than the size of the galaxy ( @xmath01.2 kpc radius ) , ruling out a tidal origin for the hi  tail .    similarly , we can also rule out that the general halo of hot gas is stripping the hi  from ngc 3073 . in an similar way",
    "as done for mcg 9 - 17 - 9 , we estimate that the required density of the hot halo in order to be able to strip the gas from ngc 3073 is @xmath62 @xmath7 which is much larger than the observed densities .",
    "however , as @xcite remark , it is possible that the ram pressure from the wind coming from ngc 3079 is stripping ngc 3073 .",
    "this is mainly , since ram pressure depends on velocity as @xmath63 , because of the high velocity of the wind ( 1000 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2  @xcite ) . for this velocity , the required density to strip the hi  at the column density observed ( @xmath64 @xmath7 ) ,",
    "is about @xmath65 @xmath57 .",
    "the lower limit for the electron density of the super - wind , near the starburst in the centre of ngc 3079 , is estimated to be @xmath66 @xmath57 ( strickland et al .",
    "assuming that the density of the wind declines with distance from the starburst according to @xmath67 , we obtain a density of about @xmath68 at the location of ngc 3073 .",
    "given the uncertainties , this matches the required density for stripping and we reiterate the suggestion made by @xcite that the cometary hi  tail of ngc 3073 is due to ram - pressure stripping by the fast , starburst driven wind from the centre of ngc 3079 .",
    "the finding of the hi  outflow seen in absorption can be added to the many interesting features of the nuclear region of ngc  3079 .",
    "the broad and shallow blueshifted hi  absorption component is blueshifted up to 600 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2  with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "being detected in absorption , this ensures that the gas is in front of the radio continuum and the blueshifted velocities indicate that the absorbing gas is outflowing .",
    "such a broad , blueshifted component has been tentatively seen also in the vla observations of @xcite . a component with such large velocities",
    "must be associated to extreme , non - gravitational radial motions .",
    "fast hi  outflows have been detected in several other radio sources with a range of agn power .",
    "many cases detected so far have been found to be associated to powerful radio jets ( e.g. , @xcite , 2013 ) , although cases associated to low - power radio sources ( e.g. , ngc  1266 ; @xcite , mrk  231 ; @xcite ) are also known . in a number of these objects , the most likely origin for the outflow",
    "is considered to be the kinetic push by the radio plasma jet following its interaction with a dense ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this has also been suggested to occur in lower - power radio sources such as ngc  1266 @xcite , a source with a radio power more similar to that of ngc  3079 .    in the case of ngc  3079",
    ", it is hard to identify the origin of the outflow .",
    "this is due to the difficulty to disentangle the effects due to the starburst from those caused by the agn , as it has been discussed in detail for the outflow of ionised gas by @xcite and @xcite . according to these studies ,",
    "the starburst component is the most likely driver , although an agn component can not be excluded . indeed , while the high infrared luminosity and the morphology of the well - known bubble observed in ngc 3079 suggest the stellar wind to be important@xcite , it has been suggested that the energy output of the agn and starburst activities are comparable @xcite .    the possibility of the existence of a molecular outflow driven by the active nucleus was already suggested by @xcite .",
    "molecular outflows have now been observed in a number of objects .",
    "the multi - phase character of gas outflows , and the co - presence of molecular and atomic hydrogen ( as well as ionized gas ) , has been established in a growing number of cases where the outflows are driven by agn .",
    "thus , the hi  outflow detected in our observations may represent the counterpart of the outflowing molecular gas ( e.g.  as in the case of the radio - loud seyfert 2 ic  5063 , @xcite ) .",
    "the limited spatial resolution of our observations can not add information about the precise location of the outflow .",
    "however , in order to shed light on its origin , we can at least derive the energetics of the outflow and compare this with what is associated with the starburst and the non - thermal radio emission .",
    "this should tell us whether any of them can be ruled out because of insufficient energy .    from the lower and upper limit of the column density as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : absorption ] , a range of values for the mass outflow rate can be obtained following @xcite and @xcite : @xmath69 where the gas is outflowing at a velocity @xmath70 from radius @xmath71 over a solid angle @xmath72 .",
    "if we assume the outflow originates from the nuclear region , @xmath73 pc , @xmath72 to be @xmath74 steradians and @xmath75 @xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2 , the above equation yields a lower limit to the mass outflow rate of @xmath76 ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 @xmath77 yr@xmath2 where we have allowed @xmath28 to range between 100 k and 1000 k. these mass outflow rates are low compared those derived for ulirgs ( ranging between 10 to 1000 @xmath77 yr@xmath2 , @xcite and for radio galaxies , ranging between 1 and 50 @xmath77 yr@xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite derived an upper limit for the ionised gas outflow in ngc  3079 of @xmath78 @xmath9  yr@xmath2 ( for @xmath79 @xmath57 ) .",
    "thus , the ionised gas outflow rate in ngc  3079 is relatively modest compared to ulirgs , but of similar amplitude as the hi  outflow rates .    with the hi  mass outflow rates , we can derive the kinetic power of the outflow using the approach of @xcite , including both the radial and turbulent component of the gas motion .",
    "@xmath80 the estimated values range between a few @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xmath1erg@xmath1s@xmath2 , again reflecting the range of column densities .",
    "the energy associated with the nuclear starburst as derived by @xcite is estimated to be @xmath13@xmath83 @xmath1erg@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite quote that for values of @xmath84 @xmath57 , the injection rate of the nuclear starburst would have been able to produce the hi  outflow ( i.e.  providing a power of @xmath85 @xmath1erg@xmath1s@xmath2 ) .",
    "recent results ( e.g.  nyland et al .",
    "2013 ) have shown that fast hi  ( and molecular gas ) outflows can also be driven by low - power radio sources due to the high efficiency of the coupling between the radio plasma with the surrounding ism / igm e.g.  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is worth exploring the energetics connected to the radio plasma also for ngc  3079 .",
    "indeed , the presence of an interaction of the parsec - scale jet with ambient gas in ngc  3079 has been shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a number of studies have recently addressed the crucial issue of the conversion between radio luminosities and jet power .",
    "we use the relations proposed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . despite the different approaches used by these authors in deriving these relations",
    ", we obtain a reasonable agreement from these different methods , indicating a jet power of @xmath0@xmath86 @xmath1erg@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , also the jet power appears to be large enough to drive the hi  outflow .",
    "this is further supported by the presence of jet - cloud interactions in the galaxy , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , a caveat to the radio plasma driving the outflow is whether the putative vlbi jet is really connected to the radio lobes . interestingly",
    ", the position angle of the vlbi scale radio jet is close to the plane of the galaxy @xcite , and misaligned by about @xmath87 with respect to the large - scale lobes . in this situation",
    ", one could hypothesise that this is due to a deflection partly caused by the interaction with the medium : this would be supported by the presence of broad blue - shifted hi  absorption . a similar ( albeit not so extreme ) misalignment",
    "was found in at least an other spiral galaxy - ic  5063 - where the jet is seen in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "interestingly , ic  5063 also hosts massive outflows of ionised , hi  and molecular gas ( @xcite , 2015 ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our considerations show that it is plausible for the radio jet to have a role in driving the hi  outflow .",
    "however , the connection between the complex radio continuum structure in the inner pc region @xcite and the large - scale disk , and also the connection between the pc @xcite and kpc - scale outflows in this galaxy still remains ambigiuous .",
    "we have presented deep hi  observations of the famous starburst / seyfert galaxy ngc  3079 and its surroundings .",
    "the improved sensitivity of the data compared to those in the literature have allowed to uncover new and interesting features which give an improved picture of the hectic evolution of ngc 3079 and its environment :    1 .",
    "ngc  3079 has a more extended ( out to @xmath022 kpc radius ) and disturbed hi  disk than previously observed .",
    "the hi  disk is lopsided on all scales , both morphologically and kinematically , and shows a mild warp on both the north and south sides .",
    "the strong kinematical lopsidedness in the central regions , and the non - circular motions associated with that , are possibly connected to the high levels of star formation in the central regions .",
    "ngc 3079 is clearly interacting with its neighbours .",
    "large streams of gas and tails are visible in the ngc  3079 group . the disk of ngc 3079 is strongly affected by these interactions .",
    "in addition to the two previously known companion galaxies ( ngc 3073 and mcg  9 - 17 - 9 ) , hi  gas has been detected from five more galaxies ( three with previously unknown redshift ) which are likely associated with the ngc  3079 group . among these ,",
    "two of them ( [ ygk81 ] 078 and sdss  j100311.18 + 553557.6 ) seem to be taking part in the interactions in the group .",
    "a long hi  bridge is visible between ngc 3079 and mcg 9 - 17 - 9 spanning over a projected length of @xmath033 kpc .",
    "we suggest that ram pressure due to the hot x - ray halo of ngc  3079 is most likely responsible for the stripping of gas from mcg  9 - 17 - 9 , although also tidal effects may have been relevant in the past .",
    "the cometary hi  tail of ngc 3073 , earlier discovered by @xcite , extends even further , while a second , shorter tail is now also revealed .",
    "our result agrees with the conclusion of @xcite that ram pressure by the super wind coming from ngc 3079 is responsible for this tail .",
    "an hi  counterpart to the ionised gas outflow of ngc  3079 has been detected in the form of a blueshifted wing of the hi  absorption profile against the central continuum source , extending to velocities well outside the range of rotational velocities .",
    "however , we can not distinguish between the starburst and agn driving this outflow , with both having comparable power sufficient to drive the outflow .",

    "<S> we present deep neutral hydrogen ( hi ) observations of the starburst / seyfert galaxy ngc  3079 and its environment , obtained with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope . </S>",
    "<S> our observations reveal previously unknown components , both in hi  emission and in absorption , that show that ngc  3079 is going through a hectic phase in its evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the hi  disk appears much more extended than previously observed and is morphologically and kinematically lopsided on all scales with evidence for strong non - circular motions in the central regions . </S>",
    "<S> our data reveal prominent gas streams encircling the entire galaxy suggesting strong interaction with its neighbours . a 33-kpc long hi  bridge is detected between ngc  3079 and mcg  9 - 17 - 9 , likely caused by ram - pressure stripping of mgc  9 - 17 - 9 by the halo of hot gas of ngc  3079 . </S>",
    "<S> the cometary hi  tail of the companion ngc  3073 , earlier discovered by irwin et al . , extends about twice as long in our data , while a shorter , second tail is also found . </S>",
    "<S> this tail is likely caused by ram - pressure stripping by the strong , starburst driven wind coming from ngc  3079 . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect , in absorption , a nuclear hi  outflow extending to velocities well outside what expected for gravitational motion . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely an atomic counterpart of the well - studied outflow of ionised gas present in this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate that also large amounts of _ cold _ gas are blown out of ngc  3079 by the starburst / agn . </S>",
    "<S> our estimates of the jet energy and kinetic power suggest that both the agn and the starburst in ngc  3079 are powerful enough to drive the atomic outflow .    </S>",
