    "this is seen in the photometric metallicity distribution by @xcite .",
    "the vertical abundance gradient was initially interpreted as inconsistent with the formation of the bulge from the disk via dynamical instabilities , which results in a boxy / peanut morphology similar to that already observed in the milky way @xcite .",
    "this large abundance gradient was instead interpreted as evidence for a bulge formed via mergers or dissipational collapse @xcite .",
    "subsequently , however , bulge metallicity gradients in @xmath15 like those measured for the milky way have been shown to be a natural consequence of bulge formation via instability of the disk , due to the preferential redistribution of stars according to their initial phase space energies in the disk @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the overall large negative gradient in the mean of the mdf is now believed simply to reflect the changing contribution of populations which have different spatial distributions in the innermost regions .",

    "the three populations a - c with  @xmath29 have peaks at metallicities of about + 0.15 , -0.25 , -0.7 dex , respectively and provide about 95% of stars in the bulge .",

    "this implies that stars with  @xmath2 that are present in the inner region are not part of the boxy / peanut bulge morphology and are not on x - profile - supporting x1 orbit families .",
    "the most metal - rich stars show the largest minima between peaks in the k - magnitude distribution of stars and are the most strongly involved in the x - shape @xcite .",

    "the rotation and dispersion profiles reported by @xcite and shown in figure [ fig : kinematics ] as a function of  support the differentiation of the populations .",
    "the kinematics of stars in populations a & b are related and are different from the other components .",
    "the stars in populations a and b , which are part of the split clump and the boxy / peanut bulge , show the same characteristic peaked pattern of velocity dispersion in the two left hand panels of figure [ fig : kinematics ] , with population a being a colder replica of population b. population c , associated with the thick disk in the inner galaxy , is rotating as rapidly as the more metal - rich populations ( all show the latitude - independent rotation profiles that are commonly seen in boxy bulges ) but its velocity dispersion profile has a different shape .",
    "the most metal - poor stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath34 have the slow rotation profile and high dispersion that might be expected of a population that had no ancestral association with a disk , such as a spheroidal population in the bulge or the stars of the inner halo or an underlying merger component .",
    "other studies @xcite have proposed that the mdf of the bulge comprises two populations , a metal - rich population that is part of the boxy / peanut bulge and a metal poor population that is an old spheroid ( i.e. with a possible formation history that is distinct from the disk and halo components of the milky way ) .",
    "although note that @xcite concludes that whether their two mdf components have different formation histories is yet to be determined .",
    "the decomposition of stars into two roughly equal components from @xcite is shown in figure [ fig : gonzalez ] , from the gibs survey @xcite , where these two populations peak at [ fe / h ] of about + 0.25 dex and -0.3 dex .",
    "the 2-component decomposition places fewer stars within the boxy / peanut or x - shaped structure , attributing approximately 50% to an old spheroid @xcite .",
    "the 5-population model of @xcite attributes 95% of stars to be disk stars , with the population c ( at  = 0.7 ) being disk stars but simply not part of the x - shaped morphology ( possibly because they were originally part of a hotter thick disk which was dynamically less responsive to the instability ) .",
    "these two interpretations therefore have different implications for the stars in the inner region in terms of their origin from the disk and the contribution of any additional population that is distinct from any other milky way population and specifically from the bulge , such as an old spheroid formed via mergers at high redshift . whereas a large fraction , up to 50% of stars in the two - component decomposition ,",
    "are associated with an old - spheroid component , only @xmath35 5% of the population in the 5 population decomposition is associated with any old spheroid component , and this component may simply be metal - poor halo stars in the inner region and not a unique population of the bulge .",
    "the alpha - enhancement of stars in the bulge shows similar trends to that of the thin and thick disk in the solar neighbourhood , as reported by alves brito et al .",

    "comparing the  trends and the individual abundance patterns ( [ x / fe ] ) for bulge stars with stars at other galactic radii is important for understanding the detailed formation of the bulge and its relationship with the disk .",
    "a large fraction of the bulge stars is likely to have come from the disk , and therefore the broad expectation would be that disk and bulge abundance trends will be similar . however , there are a number of perturbing processes that may show abundance signatures .",
    "these include the star formation rates in the inner and outer disk and the growth of the disk over time , gas inflow driving star formation , and radial migration .",

    "the stellar parameters have been obtained with the cannon @xcite and demonstrate that the inner galaxy has the narrowest alpha sequence , which is offset to higher metallicity than in the outer galaxy .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ fig : apogee_alpha ] marks the approximate trend of the high - alpha sequence that is seen in the innermost region .",
    "the density distribution shows that , in the zones further from the galactic plane at a given radius , more stars are found in the low metallicity / high alpha sequence than in the high metallicity / low alpha sequence .",
    "figure [ fig : apogee_alpha ] shows that there is a smooth transition from the outer to inner region at a given height from the plane , with an increasing mean metallicity .",
    "the low - alpha sequence dominates in the outer region and a narrower sequence extending to lower  and higher  dominates in the inner region . at intermediate radii , near the sun , both low and high alpha sequences are present .",
    "the narrower and high - alpha sequence seen in the inner galaxy implies that the star formation and chemical evolution rate was high at the early epoch in the disk at which the bulge stars were forming .",
    "the star formation continued over a relatively brief period , and this single sequence is a snapshot in time of the rapid chemical evolution of the early disk from which the bulge was formed .",
    "@xcite showed that bulges form early on after the disk , and over a short period of 1 - 2 gyr .",
    "this rapid formation at early times is consistent with the single continuous alpha sequence seen in the inner 3kpc of the milky way that is observed in apogee data .",
    "the simulations of @xcite show that stars are mapped into the bulge from the disk according to their initial phase space location .",
    "stars now in the bulge that reside nearest to the plane originate from the innermost region of the disk .",
    "similarly , the stars in the bulge whose orbits take them to higher @xmath1 came from larger radii in the disk and preferentially at larger heights above the plane .",
    "simulations that include star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it also has a high and relatively latitude - independent velocity dispersion as seen in fig .",

    "@xcite measured the individual abundances of microlensed dwarf bulge stars and found that the stars with @xmath38 1.0 have very similar chemical abundance trends to the nearby thick disk stars .    the bulge rr lyrae population , whose mdf peaks around @xmath39 @xcite , has been used to trace the distribution of the old metal - poor population of stars in the bulge .",
    "the rr lyrae stars are ideal tracers of structure because their distances can be accurately estimated .",
    "although @xcite reported the spatial distribution of the rr lyrae to be spheroidal with only a slight elongation , the survey of @xcite showed that the metal - poor rr lyrae very closely trace the barred structure of intermediate - age red clump giants .",
    "@xcite show that the spatial distribution of the rr lyrae population is barred but that these stars are not part of the x - shape structure .",
    "they also report two sequences of rr lyrae with marginally different metallicities , proposing evidence for the role of mergers in the initial formation of the bulge .",
    "although they may follow the elongated distribution of the bar , the rr lyrae stars may still be part of the halo but which has been pulled into a bar shape by the potential of the other stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the high - resolution detailed chemical abundance analysis of a handful of the most metal - poor bulge stars with  @xmath40 by @xcite and @xcite reported similar individual element enhancement and alpha - enhancement trends to halo stars of the same metallicity ( although @xcite noted an abundance scatter that may be larger ) . from the analysis of the dynamics and detailed chemical abundances of three bulge stars with  @xmath41 , @xcite report that these stars follow the abundance trends identified previously for metal - poor halo stars , except for scandium .",

    "the abundance patterns of this rare stellar population which is concentrated to the bulge could provide critical insight into the composition of the universe at the highest redshift and the conditions at the beginning of the milky way s formation .",
    "numerous studies , including small programs and large surveys observing the bulge across a broad spatial extent ( e.g. argos , gibs , vvv ) have characterised the overall metallicity distribution of the bulge . until recently , most spectroscopic studies have looked off the plane , at @xmath43 . although a small number of fields nearer to the plane have been observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "has also shown the trends of alpha and individual element abundances for stars of the bulge , at all metallicities , to be comparable with those of disk and halo stars of similar metallicity in the local neighbourhood .",

    "6 illustrates the rapid history of chemical evolution that occurred in the inner galaxy , probably before the bulge structure was in place .",
    "the anomalous scandium abundance of the most metal - poor bulge stars ( @xmath44 ) may indicate that these very metal - poor stars in the bulge may indeed be among the first stars to have form in the very early galaxy .",
    "coupling the stellar metallicity distribution data with the kinematics and morphological structure @xcite is key to understanding the relationship between the bulge and the other populations of the milky way that were present at the time that the bulge was formed .",
    "specifically this is important for understanding what fraction of the bulge was formed from pre - existing disk material , and what is the nature of the bulge stars that are not associated with the boxy bulge .",
