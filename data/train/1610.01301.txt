    "the parametric instabilities @xcite and electron acoustic modes @xcite excited by the intense laser pulse may significantly perturb its propagation .    although the experiments show promising results concerning ion acceleration in near critical plasmas @xcite , there is no clear understanding of the mechanisms of laser energy transfer and ion acceleration .",

    "the simulation of the interaction of a circularly polarized laser pulse with the same intensity and duration , with the same plasma , gives very similar results .",

    "[ fig_these-6_eyright - trans ] and [ fig_these-6_electronheating ] .",
    "however , a larger part of the laser pulse is transmitted through the plasma without being absorbed so that the cumulated transmission eventually reaches 38.8 % .",
    "the total electron energy reaches around 42 % of the total laser pulse energy when the laser pulse goes out of the plasma .",
    "this represents 2.8 times as much energy as the energy transferred to electrons in the @xmath37-case since the intensity and the energy of the laser pulse are multiplied by 4 .",
    "the ion energy cut - off then reaches 64.7 mev ( plasma front side ) and 83.9 mev ( plasma rear side ) at the end of the simulation .    in the case",
    "where the laser intensity is divided by four ( @xmath198 w.@xmath1 ) , the plasma absorption is reduced to 22.3 % .",
    "a large part of the remaining laser pulse energy is backscattered by the plasma ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_polarlin_comparison ] ) . in this case",
    ", the laser intensity is not sufficiently high to excite the srs instability , the absorption is strongly reduced and the backscattered wave has a frequency close to the laser frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the reduced laser energy deposition is readily manifested in the reduced ion energy cut - off which is 7.9 mev and 5.0 mev for the plasma front and rear side respectively .",
    "the chosen plasma density of @xmath2 is optimal for the efficient laser absorption , which is reduced for both lower and higher plasma densities . for the lower densities",
    ", absorption is still related to the srs instability , but it is less efficient and more laser energy is transmitted through the plasma . in the case of interaction of a laser pulse with the intensity @xmath199 w.@xmath1 with a denser plasma",
    "whose density equals @xmath200 , the absorption is reduced to 44.7 % .",
    "similarly as for the @xmath2 case , the srs instability is the main process responsible of the electron heating , however , it leads for a stronger back - scattering , which represents 53.7 % of the total laser pulse energy .",
    "besides , in this case , the frequency of the plasma wave excited by the srs instability equals @xmath201 . since this frequency is lower than the one excited in the @xmath2 plasma ( @xmath202 ) , the fraction of energy @xmath203 transferred to the plasma wave and then to the electrons is also lower than for the @xmath2 case .",
    "the laser pulse is progressively depleted in the plasma as the zone of srs activity extends with a lower velocity @xmath204 so the laser pulse is almost totally absorbed along the first @xmath205 of the plasma length and the transmission equals only 0.7 % .",
    "consequently , the laser energy deposition is rather inhomogeneous leading to a less efficient ion acceleration .",
    "the protons reach a higher energy , 28.0 mev , at the front side and a lower energy , 18.4 mev , at the rear side than for the @xmath206-case .",
    "this example confirms that the target areal density @xmath207 should be optimized for an efficient and homogeneous electron heating and an efficient ion acceleration .",
    "these comparisons show that the particular case presented in this paper corresponds to the optimal choice of parameters , which leads to the highest energy transfer to the plasma .",
    "it corresponds to a case where the srs instability leads to a very efficient and homogeneous electron heating and low rate of reflectivity ( below 30 % ) .",
    "these conditions are favourable for ion acceleration at the plasma edges and in the cavities .",
    "the present study is limited to 1d simulations , which allow us to have a high numerical precision along with a high spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "thanks to large arrays of data , the features in real space can be compared with the detailed spectral properties of the fields thus allowing a clear identification of the physical mechanisms in play . in particular , this is the first clear demonstration of the dominant role of the srs instability in plasmas with the density larger than the quarter of critical density .",
    "we believe the physical processes discussed in this paper are also operational in the real three - dimensional space .",
    "although the microscopic features may look different in 2d or 3d simulations due to other competing processes such as laser filamentation and plasma wave modulation , the characteristics averaged over the transverse directions should not be much different from the 1d simulations .",
    "this has been demonstrated for lower laser intensities for the case of sbs @xcite and srs @xcite parametric instabilities .",
