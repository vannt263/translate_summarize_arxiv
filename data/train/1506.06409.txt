    "primordial gravity waves are expected to be produced during cosmic inflation in addition to scalar perturbations .",
    "if indeed present , they would leave a characteristic footprint on the polarized anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , as they are considered to be essentially the sole source of the so - called primordial @xmath0-mode residing at the super - horizon scales at the time of the last scattering .",
    "a detection of the @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum at large angular scales would be then treated as a smoking gun of inflation , while a precise measurement of its amplitude would constrain the energy scale of inflation , or , geometrically speaking , the expansion rate of the universe during inflation @xcite .",
    "this amplitude is expressed by the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath2 , defined as the relative power of primordial gravity waves with respect to that of the scalar perturbations at some pivot scale @xmath8 , chosen here to be equal to @xmath9 mpc@xmath10 .",
    "currently , the most stringent upper bound on @xmath2 using temperature anisotropies has been derived by the planck  collaboration : @xmath11 at 95% cl @xcite , while a recent joint analysis of the planck  and  polarized data set an upper limit @xmath12 at 95% cl @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 could allow to discriminate between different inflationary models .",
    "in particular , if this upper bound @xmath13 is indeed realized in nature , this would imply a rather high amount of primordial gravity waves thus favoring large - fields inflationary models @xcite .    at smaller angular scales , the @xmath0-mode is dominated by the lensing induced signal .",
    "this signal is generated by the gravitational lensing of the cmb photons due to the large scale structure @xcite .",
    "the lensing contribution is well - understood from a theoretical point of view and can be uniquely predicted given the primary @xmath1-modes anisotropies and the lensing deflection field @xcite .",
    "such predictions have been been recently confirmed by the sptpol  @xcite and polarbear  experiments  @xcite , with also constraints on the cmb lensing @xmath0-mode power spectrum  @xcite . the lensing @xmath0-mode signal does not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "it therefore acts as a source of an additional noise masking the primordial , @xmath2-dependent @xmath0-mode , and making its detection more difficult . striving for a detection of @xmath2 ,",
    "one has to either try to remove this lensing signal  @xcite or rely solely on the large angular scales . in this latter case",
    "two features of the primordial @xmath0-mode spectrum are of particular interest as they are anticipated to be particularly prominent .",
    "these are so - called reionization and recombination bumps peaking at @xmath14 and at @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "+ measuring @xmath0-mode is made even more difficult by the fact that measurements as performed by the majority of current experiments , which scan the sky in order to produce its maps , are straightforwardly expressed only in terms of the stokes parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath1- and @xmath0-mode are mathematically related to the stokes parameters  @xcite and can be therefore recovered from the observational data .",
    "this however is only simple , if full - sky data were available .",
    "in contrast , realistic cmb experiments provide maps of polarized anisotropies , which only cover a reduced fraction of the celestial sphere , ranging from @xmath18 for balloon - borne and ground - based experiments to @xmath19 for satellite missions . in the context of pseudospectrum estimation of the angular power spectra on an incomplete sky part of the @xmath1-mode signal",
    "is unavoidably mislabelled as @xmath0-modes and vice verse .",
    "though such leakages can be corrected on average , the leaked signal inevitably contributes to the sampling variance of the other reconstructed spectrum .",
    "this dramatically increases the uncertainties of the estimated @xmath0-mode spectrum since the cosmological @xmath1-mode is expected to be at least two orders of magnitude higher than the @xmath0-mode in terms of their power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the leakages and approaches to their removal were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite and a relevant pseudospectrum estimator , referred to as the pure pseudospectrum estimator , was proposed subsequently in ref .",
    "this estimator has been thoroughly investigated and extended to include an optimization of the sky apodization  @xcite , cross - spectrum approaches  @xcite , and , @xmath20 and @xmath21 cross - correlations  @xcite .",
    "alternative constructions of pseudospectrum estimators correcting for @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakages have been also proposed  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the pure pseudospectrum method has been found the most mature and efficient one , particularly due to its ability of optimizing the sky apodizations  @xcite , making it a method of choice for many practical applications .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the leakages are indeed ubiquities and correcting for them is as mandatory for small - scale experiments , covering @xmath18 of the sky , as for satellite - like missions , with access to as much as @xmath19 of the sky  @xcite .",
    "though the impact of the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage on the variance of the @xmath0-mode power spectrum is generally acknowledged , it is rarely included in projecting performance of planned cmb experiments or instrumental concepts from the point of view of their setting constraints on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath2 .",
    "instead , the major body of work ( see  @xcite for some recent examples ) in this area is based on simplified mode - counting arguments ( see , however e.g. ,  @xcite for some exceptions ) .",
    "this stemmed mostly from the practical reasons , as the impact of the leakage is neither calculable analytically nor analysis method independent .",
    "+ the objective of this work is to fill this gap and present a more systematic study of the impact of the presence of the leakage on the performance forecasts of cmb b - mode experiments .",
    "the paper consists of two parts . in the first part , sec .",
    "[ sec : cap ] , we consider idealized observations of azimuthally symmetric sky areas with homogenous noise and study differences between performance forecasts derived applying three different approaches for different assumed sky area sizes .",
    "subsequently , from these three different perspectives we revisit the issue of the optimal sky area , which would permit setting the most stringent constraints on the scalar - to - tensor ratio , @xmath2 , given a fixed length and sensitivity of the experiment .    in the second part ,",
    "[ sec : realistic ] , we complete those considerations by discussing more realistic sky areas defined for three types of experiments : small - scale observations covering @xmath22% of the sky , an array of ground - based telescope covering @xmath23% and a satellite - like mission capable of delivering up to @xmath24% of the foreground clean sky .",
    "our conclusions are drawn out in sec . [",
    "sec : conclu ] , where we also briefly sketch the implications for constraining inflationary models .    throughout this work",
    "we neglect complications such as polarized diffuse foregrounds , e.g. ,  @xcite and account for resolved points sources only by appropriately tailoring the adopted mask .",
    "we also assume that no subtraction of the lensing @xmath0-mode has been attempted  @xcite .",
    "we consider first the case of small - scale experiments in an idealized way .",
    "the observed part of the celestial sphere is assumed to be azimuthally symmetric , given by a spherical cap .",
    "we however let vary the sky coverage from 0.5% to 10% .",
    "the noise is an homogeneous , white noise , and its level is fixed at @xmath25k - arcminute for @xmath26 ( a typical level for ongoing small - scale experiments ) . for a fixed sensitivity and a fixed time of observation , the noise level ( in @xmath27k - arcminute )",
    "scales as : @xmath28}{1\\%}}\\times n_p(1\\%).\\ ] ] the instrumental noise reprojected on the sky thus varies from @xmath29k - arcminute to @xmath30k - arcminute for an observed fraction of the sky of 0.5% and 10% , respectively .",
    "finally , the angular resolution is given by an azimuthally symmetric , gaussian beam with a width of 8 arminutes .",
    "we subsequently investigate the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath31 , as a function of the sky coverage .",
    "this will be done considering four values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we note that the last two values are disfavored by the current data , nevertheless we include them in our considerations as they are useful in demonstrating some of the effects we describe hereafter .      translating the uncertainties on the @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum reconstruction into error bars on the measured tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath34 , can be done using a fisher matrix formalism .    for the rather small observed fractions of the celestial sphere",
    "here - considered , the @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum is reconstructed within bandpowers , labelled @xmath35 hereafter , with bandwidths @xmath36 .",
    "the binned power spectrum is given by @xmath37 , where the binning operator is defined as : @xmath38 ( our specific choice of the binning will be given in sec .",
    "[ ssec : powspec ] . )",
    "the error bars on @xmath2 are then derived from the fisher matrix via : @xmath39 with @xmath40 , which stands for the covariance matrix of the reconstructed , binned angular power spectrum of the @xmath0-mode .",
    "( note that @xmath41 denotes the _ estimator _ of the angular power spectrum , @xmath42 . )",
    "the @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum as a function of @xmath2 is modeled as : @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 two fiducial angular power spectra , which do not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "the former is just obtained as the contribution of primordial gravity waves for @xmath46 ( taking into account that the primordial @xmath0-mode is itself lensed ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to the contribution of primary @xmath1-mode transferred into @xmath0-mode because of the gravitational lensing of large scale structures .",
    "we do not consider here a potential _ delensing _ of the @xmath0-mode anisotropies , and such a contribution will be assumed to act as an additional gaussian noise for the measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "this is a simplifying assumption since the lensing - induced @xmath0-mode is non - gaussian leading to an additional , non - gaussian contribution to the covariance @xcite .",
    "gaussianity remains however a good approximation for bandpowers which are narrow enough ( @xmath47 ) @xcite , which is the case in our study .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath48 is estimated using three different approaches , as described here .",
    "first , we rely on a nave mode - counting expression ( or so - called @xmath49-formula ) . in this case",
    ", the covariance on @xmath50 is approximated by : @xmath51 with @xmath52 the noise power spectrum , @xmath53 the beam of the telescope , and , @xmath49 the portion of the celestial sphere , which is observed ( or kept in the analysis ) .",
    "the noise power spectrum scales linearly with the sky coverage .",
    "the covariance matrix for the binned power spectrum is thus given by : @xmath54\\delta_{b , b'}.       \\label{eq : mcountcov}\\ ] ] this is essentially used as a benchmark as such an evaluation of the statistical error bars on the @xmath0-mode reconstruction underestimates the error bars coming from any numerical methods to be applied to the data .",
    "second we consider the error bars that could be incurred by using a minimum variance quadratic estimator @xcite .",
    "the estimator is defined as follows : @xmath55-\\tilde{n}_{\\ell'}\\right\\}.      \\label{eq : copt}\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath56 is the covariance matrix of the maps of the stokes parameter , and @xmath57 is the column vector composed of @xmath58 ( the trace operation is across pixels ) . the quantity @xmath59 stands for the noise debias . finally , @xmath60 is the fisher information matrix given by : @xmath61 .",
    "\\label{eq : fishopt}\\ ] ] it is then shown that the covariance of the above estimator is given by the inverse of the fisher matrix , i.e. @xmath62 .",
    "we remind that this estimator is precisely built to be the quadratic estimator with the lowest variance .",
    "if the @xmath0-mode power spectrum is indeed estimated for each multipole , @xmath63 ( that is chosing @xmath64 ) , this directly gives the following expression for the error bars expected on @xmath2 : @xmath65,\\ ] ] with @xmath66 the same covariance matrix _ but _ assuming that only @xmath67 does depend on @xmath2 , in line with our approach consisting in constraining the tensor - to - scalar ratio from the @xmath0-mode s measurements only given by : @xmath68,\\ ] ] with @xmath69 the covariance matrix assuming that all the angular power spectra do depend on @xmath2 , the equation ( [ eq : fisher ] ) is therefore replaced by : @xmath70 in the above , the indices @xmath71 runs over @xmath72 and @xmath21 .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : fisher ] ) is finally obtained assuming that only @xmath67 in @xmath69 does depend on the tensor - to - scalar ratio . ] . in the case of azimuthally symmetric patches , the numerical computation of such fisher matrices ( either @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) ,",
    "can be performed in a reasonable time using the expression found in the appendix f of ref .",
    "@xcite , and by using the s@xmath75hat package to perform spherical harmonic transforms @xcite .",
    "( the use of this massively parallel package allows for a rapid computation of the covariance matrix for large sky coverages . ) . in the standard case , for brute force calculation",
    "the fisher matrix requires @xmath76 operations to be evaluated , but in this calculation , evaluating the spin harmonics by recursion in @xmath63 makes the computational cost as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the number of rings actually used .    practically speaking , one should nonetheless include the impact of binning , done as follows .",
    "first one defines the so - called _ optimal pseudospectrum _ : @xmath79-\\tilde{n}_{\\ell}.\\ ] ] one easily checks that @xmath80 ( where we also include the impact of an azimuthally symmetric beam ) .",
    "one then introduces the matrix : @xmath81 with the interpolation operator , @xmath82 : @xmath83 the binned estimator , @xmath84 , is finally defined as : @xmath85 with @xmath86 the binned , optimal pseudospectrum . from that last definition , and making use of eqs .",

    "+ we note that this way of estimating the uncertainties on the power spectrum reconstruction is also relevant for maximum - likelihood approaches , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "third , we make use of the x@xmath75pure code and monte - carlo simulations to estimate the covariance matrix expected for the pure pseudospectrum approach",
    ". details on the pure pseudospectrum estimator can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in practice",
    ", the power spectrum is estimated within bandpower and the covariance matrix reconstructed from the mc simulations is directly @xmath91 .",
    "the numerical cost of this scales as @xmath92 , allowing for rapid mc simulations .    for each sky coverage and for each value of @xmath2 here -",
    "considered , we compute optimized sky apodizations to apply to the maps of @xmath16 and @xmath17 . those optimized sky apodizations are described in refs . @xcite and they allow for having the smallest error bars on the @xmath0-mode power spectrum reconstruction within the context of pure pseudospectrum techniques .",
    "those sky apodizations are a set of spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 window functions to be applied to the maps of the stokes parameter .",
    "they can be interpreted as the window functions , which make the pure pseudospectrum estimator as close as possible to the minimum - variance quadratic estimator @xcite .",
    "numerically speaking , computing those optimized sky apodizations may be long , especially for intricate shape of the observed region and/or low level of noise . using an iterative method ,",
    "the numerical cost is @xmath93 , with @xmath94 a number of iterations ranging from few tens to few hundreds for simple patch geometry and noise level considered here ( see sec .",
    "iii in @xcite ) .",
    "we stress that for a given sky patch , those sky apodizations are to be optimized for each value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio and bin - by - bin . taking into account the number of bins ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : powspec ] ) , the number of sky fractions and the number of values of @xmath2 , which are sampled in this study , this means that 1664 of such sky apodizations have to be computed .",
    "fortunately , in the case of homogeneous noise and patches with relatively simple contours ( which is obviously the case for a spherical cap ) , it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that an approximated but numerically fast computation of those sky apodizations in the harmonic domain is possible , and indeed leads to error bars equal to those obtained thanks to a direct , pixel - based computation of the optimized sky apodizations .",
    "the numerical cost of this technique is reduced to @xmath92 which allows us to derive optimized sky apodizations for each value of the sky coverage , and for each value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "our chosen bandpowers for reconstructing @xmath67 are the following .",
    "the first bin starts at @xmath95 and we use a constant bandwidth , @xmath96 .",
    "our last bin extends up to @xmath97 .",
    "the value of the maximum multipole is chosen in order to include all the relevant contributions from the primordial @xmath0-mode , that is until the lensing @xmath0-mode be the dominant contribution to the total @xmath0-mode power .",
    "in addition , for the experimental cases under consideration in this paper , we use beamwidths up to 8 arcminutes , corresponding to a cut - off of @xmath98 .",
    "the choice of the bandwidth is mainly motivated by the use of the pure pseudospectrum estimator .",
    "especially , it is mandatory for the numerical inversion of the mode - mixing matrices to be possible .",
    "we also note that the bandwidth is wide enough so that the correlations between different bins are nearly uncorrelated in the covariance of pure pseudospectrum estimator .",
    "we discuss the role of the bin width later on .",
    "we stress that the multipoles ranging from @xmath99 to @xmath95 ( corresponding to the reionization peak , and gathered in one bandpower ) are actually used in the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimation of @xmath67 . however , given the limited sky coverages considered here such low multipoles are difficult to estimate and hardly constrained by the data .",
    "this bin is therefore not included in our analysis of the signal - to - noise ratio .    the uncertainties on the estimated power spectrum of the @xmath0-mode as functions of the sky fraction ,",

    "each panel corresponds to a different approach to derive the covariance matrix , @xmath91 : mode - counting , minimum variance quadratic estimator , and , pure pseudospectrum estimator ( from left to right ) .",
    "as expected , we do observe that the lowest error bars are the ones from the mode - counting estimation of the uncertainties , while the highest error bars are obtained from the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimator .",
    "the error bars from the minimum variance , quadratic estimator lie between those two . at the largest accessible scales , @xmath102 , the error bars from the pure pseudospectrum estimator",

    "similarly , the error bars from the pure pseudospectrum estimators are at most @xmath103 higher than the ones derived from the minimum variance , quadratic estimators . at the smaller angular scales where lensing dominates , the three approaches lead to almost the same uncertainties .",
    "+ the behaviour of the uncertainties as a function of the sky fraction is common to the three approaches . at the smaller angular scales",
    "first ( for multipoles greater than @xmath104 ) , the behavior is monotonic since the uncertainties systematically increase with the value of @xmath49 .",
    "this is because at these scales , the variance is dominated by the noise , which increases with the sky fraction . at larger scales",

    "this means that for @xmath108 , the noise is now dominating the variance .",
    "once this transition value of @xmath109 is crossed , the noise contribution dominates the variance for all our considered angular scales , @xmath110 $ ] .",

    "<S> we find , however , that the mode - counting overestimates the detection significance by a factor @xmath3 as compared to the lossless maximum variance approach and by a factor @xmath4 as compared to the lossy pure pseudo - spectrum estimator . in a second time </S>",
    "<S> , we consider more realistic experimental configurations . with a pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of @xmath0-modes and considering only statistical uncertainties , we find that a detection of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 at 99% of confidence level is within the reach of current sub - orbital experiments , future arrays of ground - based telescopes and a satellite mission , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this means that an array of telescopes could be sufficient to discriminate between large- and small - field models of inflation , even if the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage is consistently included but accounted for in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> however , a satellite mission will be required to distinguish between different small - field models depending on the number of e - folds . </S>"
