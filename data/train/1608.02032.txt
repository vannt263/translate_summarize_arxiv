    "consider a wireless cellular network consisting of small , densely scattered base stations , each with limited processing capability .",
    "( in @xcite and the related engineering literature , the small base stations are called _ remote radio heads_. ) in such a network , a user @xmath0 is _ uniquely covered _ by a base station @xmath1 if @xmath0 is the only user within distance @xmath2 of @xmath1 .",
    "this makes it possible to assign the user @xmath0 to the base station @xmath1 without interference from any other user @xmath3 .",
    "ideally , we would like to assign a base station to every user .",
    "however , the underlying stochastic geometry will prevent this . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the maximum possible proportion of users who can be uniquely assigned base stations , as the communication range @xmath2 varies , for each pair of densities of both users and base stations .",
    "although we have just referred to _ two _ densities , only their ratio is significant ; in other words , the model can be scaled so that we expect one user per unit area .",
    "accordingly , we set the intensity of users to be one .",
    "thus the only parameters we need to consider are the density @xmath4 of base stations , and the range @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , we note that our analysis also solves the problem , considered in  @xcite , of uniquely assigning users to base stations ( so as to avoid _ pilot contamination _ ) ; to see this , simply interchange the roles of users and base stations .",
    "all logarithms in this paper are to base @xmath5 .",
    "our model is as follows .",
    "fix @xmath6 , and let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be independent poisson processes , of intensities @xmath4 and 1 respectively , in @xmath9 .",
    "the main case of interest is @xmath10 .",
    "the points of @xmath7 represent the base stations , and the points of @xmath8 represent the users . a user @xmath11 is uniquely covered by a base station @xmath12 if firstly @xmath13 , and secondly @xmath14 for every other user @xmath15 .",
    "we wish to calculate ( or estimate ) the proportion @xmath16 of users who are uniquely covered by base stations ; note that this proportion is also the probability that an arbitrary user is uniquely covered by a base station .",
    "in order to state our main result , we need some notation . first",
    ", for simplicity , we will initially consider just the case @xmath10 .",
    "next , let @xmath17 be the fixed open disc of radius @xmath2 , centered at the origin @xmath18 . write @xmath19 for the probability density function of the fraction @xmath20 of @xmath21 which is left uncovered when discs of radius @xmath2 , whose centers are a unit intensity poisson process , are placed in the entire plane @xmath22 .",
    "there is in general no closed - form expression for @xmath19 ; however , the function is easy to estimate by simulation .    in two dimensions , we have @xmath23    the main idea of the proof is to put down the users first , and then , for a fixed user @xmath0 , calculate the probability that a base station @xmath1  lands \" in such a way that @xmath0 is uniquely covered by @xmath1 . to this end ,",
    "place a disc @xmath24 of radius @xmath2 around each user @xmath0 , and then a fixed user @xmath0 is uniquely covered if there is a base station @xmath25 such that @xmath26 for all other users @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the random variable representing the uncovered area fraction of @xmath24 when all the other discs @xmath29 are placed randomly in the plane .",
    "then @xmath30 since for @xmath0 to be covered we require that some base station @xmath1 lands in the uncovered region in @xmath24 , which has area @xmath31 .",
    "( here , by  uncovered \" , we mean  uncovered by the union of all the other discs @xmath32 \" . ) consequently , @xmath33 as required .",
    "the same argument yields the following result for the general case . for @xmath34 , write @xmath35 for the @xmath36-dimensional ball of radius @xmath2 centered at the origin @xmath18 , and @xmath37 for the probability density function of the fraction @xmath20 of @xmath35 which is left uncovered when balls of radius @xmath2 , whose centers are a unit intensity poisson process , are placed in @xmath9 .",
    "finally , let @xmath38 be the volume of the unit - radius ball in @xmath36 dimensions .    in @xmath36 dimensions , we have @xmath39",
    "unfortunately , @xmath37 is only known exactly when @xmath40 .",
    "the result is summarized in the following lemma , in which for simplicity we consider the closely related function @xmath41 , which represents the total uncovered length in @xmath42 .    in one dimension ,",
    "we have @xmath43    consider the interval @xmath44 .",
    "the uncovered length @xmath45 of @xmath46 is determined solely by the location of the closest user @xmath47 to the left of the origin @xmath18 , and the closest user @xmath48 to the right of @xmath18 .",
    "suppose indeed that @xmath47 is located at @xmath49 and that @xmath48 is located at @xmath50 .",
    "then it is easy to see that if @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 ; in other words , all of @xmath46 is covered by @xmath53 when @xmath51 . at the other extreme ,",
    "if both @xmath54 and @xmath55 , then @xmath56 ; in this case the entire interval @xmath46 is left uncovered by @xmath53 , and so by the union @xmath57 . in general",
    ", a lengthy but routine case analysis gives @xmath58 this immediately yields the point masses of @xmath59 , since @xmath60 has a gamma distribution of mean 2 , and @xmath61 and @xmath50 are each exponentially distributed with mean 1 . for @xmath62",
    "we find , using the above expression , that @xmath63 completing the proof of the lemma .",
    "using this lemma , we obtain the following expression for @xmath64 .    in one dimension , we have @xmath65    from theorem 2 and lemma 3 we have @xmath66    @xmath64",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : one_dim ] .",
    "the value of @xmath2 that maximizes @xmath67 is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the ( principal branch of the ) lambert w - function .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath70 and that @xmath71 decreases with @xmath4 .    , where @xmath71 is given in .,width=302 ]",
    "in two dimensions , although the function @xmath72 is currently unknown , it can be approximated by simulation , and then the integral can be computed numerically . while this still involves a simulation , it is more efficient than simulating the original model itself , since @xmath73 can be used to determine the unique coverage probability for many different densities @xmath4 ( and the numerical evaluation of the expectation over @xmath28 is very efficient ) .",

    "interestingly , @xmath76 for a wide range of values of @xmath4 ; the average of @xmath77 over @xmath78 $ ] appears to be about @xmath79 .",

    "the vertical lines near @xmath82 and @xmath83 indicate the point masses .",
    "the dashed line is the uniform approximation for @xmath97.,width=302 ]        next , we turn to bounds and approximations .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain a simple lower bound for @xmath74 .",
    "[ t : p2_bound ] @xmath98 .",
    "a given user is covered if there is a base station within distance @xmath2 ( this event has probability @xmath99 ) , and if there is no other user within distance @xmath2 of that base station ( this event has probability @xmath100 ) .",
    "these last two events are independent .",
    "this bound should become tight as @xmath96 ( with @xmath2 fixed ) , or as @xmath101 ( with @xmath4 fixed ) , since , in those limiting scenarios , if there is a base station within distance @xmath2 of a user , it is likely to be the only such base station .",
    "finally , here is an approximation for @xmath74 when @xmath2 is large .",
    "we use standard asymptotic notation , so that @xmath102 as @xmath103 means @xmath104 as @xmath103 . in our case",
    ", we will have @xmath105 with @xmath4 fixed .",
    "[ t : p2_asymptote ] as @xmath105 with @xmath4 fixed , @xmath106 .",
    "( sketch ) we recall theorem 1 , which states that @xmath107 and attempt to approximate @xmath19 as @xmath105 .    to this end , it is convenient to describe the geometry of the union of discs @xmath108 in some detail .",
    "such coverage processes have been studied extensively in the mathematical literature  @xcite ; our approach follows that in  @xcite . the main idea is to consider the boundaries @xmath109 of the discs @xmath24 , rather than the discs themselves .",
    "consider a fixed disc boundary @xmath109 .",
    "this boundary intersects the boundaries @xmath110 of all discs @xmath29 whose centers @xmath3 lie at distance less than @xmath87 from @xmath0 .",
    "there are an expected number @xmath111 of such points @xmath15 , each contributing two intersection points @xmath112 , and each intersection is counted twice ( once from @xmath0 and once from @xmath3 )",
    ". therefore we expect @xmath111 intersections of disc boundaries per unit area over the entire plane ; note that these intersections _ do not _ form a poisson process , since they are constrained to lie on various circles .",
    "the next step is to move from intersections to regions .",
    "the disc boundaries partition the plane into small  atomic \" regions . drawing all the disc boundaries in the plane",
    "yields an infinite plane graph , each of whose vertices ( disc boundary intersections ) has four curvilinear edges emanating from it .",
    "each such edge is counted twice , once from each of its endvertices , so there are almost exactly twice as many edges as vertices in any large region @xmath113 .",
    "it follows from euler s formula @xmath114 for plane graphs  @xcite that the number of atomic regions in @xmath113 is asymptotically the same as the number of intersection points in @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , each vertex borders four atomic regions , so that the average number of vertices bordering an atomic region is also four .",
    "note that this last figure is just an average , and that many atomic regions will have less than , or more than , four vertices on their boundaries .",
    "the third step is to return to the discs themselves and calculate the expected number of _ uncovered _ atomic regions per unit area .",
    "it is most convenient to calculate this in terms of uncovered intersection points .",
    "a fixed intersection point is uncovered by @xmath108 with probability @xmath100 ( using the independence of the poisson process ) , so we expect @xmath115 uncovered intersections , and so @xmath116 uncovered regions , per unit area in @xmath113",
    ". therefore the expected number of uncovered regions in @xmath24 , which has area @xmath117 , is @xmath118 .",
    "how large are these uncovered atomic regions ? to answer this ,",
    "recall that the expected uncovered area in @xmath24 is @xmath116 .",
    "the uncovered atomic regions form an approximate poisson process , so that the probability of seeing two uncovered regions in @xmath24 is negligible .",
    "now let @xmath119 , with density function @xmath19 , be the uncovered area fraction in @xmath24 .",
    "we have @xmath120 , but @xmath121 .",
    "writing now @xmath122 for the expected uncovered area fraction in @xmath24 conditioned on @xmath123 , and @xmath124 for the density of @xmath122 , we see that @xmath125 .",
    "in other words , if there is uncovered area in @xmath24 , it occurs in one atomic region of expected area @xmath126 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath127    note that this is the same result that we would have obtained from the incorrect argument that @xmath119 is concentrated around its mean , whereas in fact its density @xmath19 has a large point mass at @xmath128 . indeed , the thrust of the above argument is that , for the relevant range of @xmath20 ( namely , for @xmath129 ) , @xmath130 , which is asymptotically negligible compared to the remaining terms .",
    "[ fig : p2_bounds ] shows @xmath74 , together with the lower bound from theorem  [ t : p2_bound ] and the asymptote from theorem  [ t : p2_asymptote ] . as predicted , theorem  [ t : p2_bound ] is close to the truth when @xmath2 is small , while theorem  [ t : p2_asymptote ] is more accurate for large values of @xmath2 .     for @xmath131 , with the lower bound from theorem  [ t : p2_bound ] and the approximation from theorem  [ t : p2_asymptote ] .",
