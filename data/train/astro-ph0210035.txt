    "recurrent novae ( rn ) are a rare subclass of cataclysmic variables , showing repeated outbursts with typical recurrence times of 50100 yrs .",
    "these outbursts are thought to be thermonuclear runaways on the surface of a white dwarf that has accreted enough material from the companion star to ignite the surface hydrogen .",
    "if the hot white dwarf could be observed directly , it would have the characteristics of a supersoft x - ray source ( sss ) ; i.e. , its luminosity would lie between @xmath0 ergs / s and @xmath1 ergs / s , with @xmath2 on the order of tens of ev ( nomoto 1982 , fujimoto 1982 , iben 1982 ) .",
    "the short recurrence times require either or both small envelope masses and high accretion rates of the order of @xmath310@xmath4 /yr ( warner 1995 ) . since the ejecta of rn typically are not metal - enriched , the white dwarfs in rn are not significantly eroded but may grow in mass ( starrfield  1985 ) .",
    "the fitting of rn optical light curves suggests that the white dwarf masses are high , near the chandrasekhar limit ( e.g. hachisu & kato 1999 , hachisu  2000 ) , suggesting that rn may be progenitors of type ia supernovae .",
    "though only 8 other recurrent novae are known , three subclasses are defined ( warner 1995 ) according to the nature of the companion and , consequently , the length of orbital period : the t pyx subclass with dwarf companions ( @xmath5 hrs ) , the u sco subclass with evolved main - sequence or subgiant companions ( @xmath6 day ) , and the rs oph subclass with red giant companions ( @xmath7  100 days ) .",
    "ci aql was discovered when it showed a @xmath8 m = 4.6 mag outburst in 1917 ( reinmuth 1925 ) .",
    "it was classified as a dwarf nova with long cycle length ( duerbeck 1987 ) , but this was cast in doubt ( szkody and howell 1992 , greiner  1996 ) until a second outburst , discovered in april 2000 ( takamizawa 2000 ) , revealed ci aql to be a rn . a subsequent search in the harvard plate collection led to the discovery of another outburst in 1941/1942 ( schaefer 2001b ) .",
    "ci aql is an eclipsing binary system with an orbital period of 14.84 hrs ( mennickent & honeycutt 1995 ) and therefore belongs to the u sco subclass .",
    "recurrent novae are expected to emit soft x - rays during a short interval after the ejected shell has become optically thin and before the hydrogen shell - burning ceases and during an interval of cooling . during this time",
    ", the effective radius should be somewhat larger than the radius of the white dwarf , and the luminosity should therefore be larger than 10@xmath9 erg / s .",
    "thus it should fit the profile of a sss .",
    "the only previous recurrent novae observed with x - ray detectors were t pyx and u sco .",
    "t pyx has had its last outburst in 1967 , but was argued to be a quasi - persistent supersoft x - ray source because optical data suggested a luminosity of @xmath310@xmath10 erg / s ( patterson  1998 ) .",
    "t pyx was not detected , however , in a rosat pspc observation carried out in december 1998 ( greiner , unpublished ) .",
    "a bepposax observation carried out 20 days after the u sco outburst revealed a luminous ( @xmath310@xmath10 erg / s ) soft x - ray component with a best - fit temperature of @xmath39@xmath1110@xmath12 k , consistent with steady nuclear burning continuing for at least @xmath31 month after the nova outburst ( kahabka  1999 ) .",
    "further observations of the evolution of the soft and hard x - ray emission in other sources are crucial to better test theoretical models and also to test the conjecture that rn are sn ia progenitors .    based on the observed optical light curve of ci aql over the first year after the 2000 outburst , hachisu and kato ( 2001 ) predicted that ci aql should have been active at soft x - ray wavelengths between december 2000 until august 2001 .",
    "this motivated us to observe ci aql using .",
    "we obtained two  observations using acis - s . the first one was performed on june 1 , 2001 for 2.15 ksec , and the second one on august 1 , 2001 for a total of 19.88 ksec ( see tab .",
    "[ obslog ] for details ) .    during the first  observation , we detected ci aql with a count rate of ( 6.0@xmath132.3)@xmath1110@xmath14 cts / s , collecting a total of 15 photons . in the august observation ,",
    "the mean count rate is ( 8.6@xmath130.7)@xmath1110@xmath14 cts / s , thus ci aql exhibited the same x - ray intensity as on 1 june 2000 ,    no single - component model fits the x - ray spectrum of ci aql ( second observation ; figs .",
    "13 ) . as a first approximation , and since the spectrum looks thermal , we have used a blackbody spectrum plus a power law , and find a reasonably good fit with @xmath15=50@xmath1320 ev and a power law photon index of 1.78@xmath130.72 .",
    "note , though , that due to the small number of photons the fit parameters are correlated , and therefore the reduced @xmath16 is smaller than one .",
    "using a white dwarf atmosphere model ( van teeseling  1994 ) gives a similar value of @xmath15=38@xmath1315 ev .",
    "the best - fit absorbing column is 3.6@xmath1110@xmath17 @xmath18 ( for the blackbody model ) or 5.5@xmath1110@xmath17 @xmath18 ( for the white dwarf atmosphere model ) , consistent with the foreground extinction of e(b - v ) = 0.85 ( kiss  2001 ) , but considerably less than the total galactic column in this bii=08 direction of 1.5@xmath1110@xmath19 @xmath18 ( dickey & lockman 1990 )",
    ". the unabsorbed luminosity of the blackbody ( white dwarf atmosphere ) component is 1.0@xmath1110@xmath20 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath21 erg / s ( 8.0@xmath1110@xmath22 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath21 erg / s ) .",
    "physically , such a high - temperature optically thick emission at such a low luminosity is difficult to explain",
    ". the corresponding radius of the emitting area would be 40 km , a minute fraction of the white dwarf radius .",
    "we therefore turned to other spectral models .    in some recent x - ray grating observations of novae ,",
    "the spectra show a wealth of narrow emission lines in the 0.22 kev range . though most of the identifications of these lines and their origin are not settled",
    ", we considered the possibility that pure line emission at soft energies could model the spectrum of ci aql : to model the main emission around 0.5 kev we need only one gaussian line with a width corresponding to the energy resolution of acis - s . the best - fit line energy is 0.358 kev .",
    "the spectrum at high energies ( above @xmath34 ) can similarly be fit by models other than a power law .",
    "a raymond - smith model gives a best - fit temperature of @xmath15 = 2.7@xmath132.4 kev a thermal bremsstrahlung model gives @xmath15 = 3.1@xmath133.0 kev .",
    "of course , the spectrum could also be explained by a superposition of several lines , but we do not have enough photons and/or spectral resolution to resolve this issue .",
    "the first - epoch spectrum can be fit by the model parameters of the fit to the second - epoch observation .",
    "this is not a great surprise given the few photons in the first - epoch spectrum .",
    "yet , we can conclude that ( 1 ) the intensity was seemingly steady , and ( 2 ) no major spectral change ( change in the emission mechanism ) occurred between the two  observations both in the soft as well as in the hard component  this also excludes any dramatic decrease of absorption which is expected once the expelled shell gets optically thin for x - rays , or cooling of the soft component ( though this can not be directly proven with the 15 detected x - ray photons ) .",
    "the second  observation covers about 40% of the orbital period of ci aql .",
    "we therefore analyzed the temporal behaviour of the x - ray emission , but did not find orbital variability .",
    "after our  observations occurred , more optical data became available ( schaefer 2001a ) , leading hachisu & kato ( 2002a ) to revise their modelling of the optical decay light curve of ci aql .",
    "the important new result of their revision for the interpretation of our  data is that the supersoft x - ray phase should have lasted only until may 2001 , thus ending even before the first of our  observations .",
    "but the source would have remained hot and several orders of magnitude more luminous than observed had nuclear burning ended as recently as may 2001 .",
    "the faintness of the detected x - ray emission and the fit results of a blackbody ( or white dwarf atmosphere ) model indeed suggest that ci aql was not in the nova plateau phase during our  observations . instead , the luminosity derived for an optically thick emission model explaining the soft part of the x - ray spectrum is only of the order of 10@xmath20 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath21 erg / s .",
    "however , even beyond the plateau phase the system should have be observable as a sss , because the cooling of the hot white dwarf and the concordant luminosity decay is expected to last months to years .",
    "model calculations ( hachisu & kato 2002b ) show that the temperature should have declined by a factor of @xmath32 ( from 55 ev to 30 ev ) between our two  observations , whereas the  data do not allow a temperature change by more than 10 ev .",
    "these model calculations also suggest that in the june  august 2001 time frame the luminosity of the cooling white dwarf would still be in the 10@xmath23 erg / s range , at least a factor of 1000 more than the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "thus , we find it very unlikely that the soft x - ray component around 0.5 kev is an optically thick component from the ( cooling ) white dwarf .",
    "this implies that nuclear burning ended earlier than indicated by even the revised prediction .",
    "alternatively , the soft component could be composed of ( a ) non - resolved emission line(s ) . after fitting a gaussian line to the soft component",
    ", one realizes that the spectral resolution of @xmath3100 ev makes this gaussian line broad enough to fit perfectly the soft component , and not even a second gaussian line is necessary to explain the x - ray emission below 0.7 kev .",
    "the best - fit line energy for this gaussian is 0.358@xmath130.058 kev , and the unabsorbed line luminosity 2.7@xmath1110@xmath22 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath21 erg / s .",
    "we suggest this line to be the h - like cvi line ( nominal energy at 0.3676 kev ) .    rebinning the spectrum into only 1@xmath24 confidence level bins ( fig .",
    "[ xsp4sig ] ) , the search for possible further excess emission above the broad band continuum emission at higher energies reveals marginal evidence for possible lines at 0.8 kev , 1.28 kev and 6.3 kev .",
    "these could be interpreted as ovii , neix or mgx and fexxvi lines .",
    "given the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum , this is speculative .",
    "the hard spectrum is not constrained : it could be fit by either a power law , a raymond - smith model or a bremsstrahlung model .",
    "also the marginal fe detection does not provide a clue for its origin ( e.g. reflection off the disk , or thermal plasma ) .",
    "indeed , the fe emission could be due to matter from the white dwarf , consistent with the strong feii lines seen in the optical spectra ( kiss  2001 ) . the small temperature of order of 3 kev ,",
    "if interpreted as thermal emission , is consistent with ci aql having had a very slow nova outburst , and a rather low expansion velocity , a correlation which has been found already in earlier novae ( e.g. mukai & ishida 2001 for nova v382 vel ) .",
    "we note , on the other hand , that the unabsorbed luminosity of this hard component of @xmath310@xmath25 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath21 erg / s ( 0.510 kev ) is in the range of x - ray luminosities usually found in cataclysmic binaries during quiescence . however , ci aql during quiescence is definitely fainter : rosat observations in 1992 and 1993 failed to detect ci aql , implying an upper limit on the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of 5@xmath1110@xmath26 erg / s ( d/1 kpc)@xmath21 in the 0.12.4 kev range ( greiner  1996 ) . thus , 16 months after its outburst , ci aql had not yet returned to its quiescent level of x - ray emission .",
    "thus , it seems clear that we observed the ci aql system when it had ended both the phase of shell burning and cooling as well as the phase in which the wind was obscuring the soft emission . in the cases of nova v382 velorum ( burwitz  2002 ) and v1494 aql ( krautter  2002 ) it has recently been possible to observe the dramatic changes of the x - ray emission of novae from a highly absorbed spectrum during the very early times , over the development and subsequent fading of a luminous supersoft x - ray component towards a completely line dominated spectrum with hardly any detectable continuum . while the first two stages of this evolution are physically well understood in terms of the expanding shell blocking less and less of the x - ray radiation of the white dwarf until burning on its",
    "surface ceases , the origin of the line dominated spectrum is not clear .",
    "one possibility is that during the late phase of a nova , when the shell has become transparent , the medium around the system is ionized by the still uv - euv bright white dwarf .",
    "it would require far less than one part in a thousand conversion efficiency of photoionization of the c vi line to explain , e.g. , the spectrum of ci aql as observed with , consistent with photoionization models around supersoft ionizers ( rappaport  1994 ) .",
    "however , because of the steep and rapidly changing density profile due to the expanding shell / wind , the recombination emission may be rapidly suppressed .",
    "alternatively , the line dominated spectrum could result from the interaction of the expanding shell with the circumstellar matter , shocks within the expanding shell , or from shocks due to collisions of a fast wind with the interstellar matter .",
    "detailed investigations of the complex emission line spectra have just begun , and promise a better understanding in the near future .",
    "we are indebted to h. tananbaum for granting ddt time for the observations .",
