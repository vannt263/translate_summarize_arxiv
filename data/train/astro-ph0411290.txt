    "various observational and theoretical studies have been carried out which aimed at the investigation of possible ionization mechanisms of the diffuse ionized gas ( dig , also called interstellar froth @xcite ) in the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as in external galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . as a main result of these studies , photoionization by ob - stars turned out to be the main ionization mechanism of this gas .",
    "it soon became obvious that existing photoionization models can not predict the observed dig spectrum correctly . in order to reconcile theory with observations ,",
    "the current strategy is to include additional heating and ionization mechanisms , such as shock ionization , turbulence or magnetic reconnection ( to name only a few ) .",
    "even this did nt solve the inconsistencies completely .",
    "therefore , we decided to analyze the existing models critically according to the radiative transfer and the geometry they consider",
    ". the most commonly used codes to model dig are cloudy @xcite and the one written by mathis @xcite with its two modifications presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , an implementation of ferland s cloudy has been published by @xcite for the edge - on galaxy ngc891 .",
    "there are two severe shortcomings common to all these codes : ( 1 ) the problem of the radiative transfer is solved analytically which requires unrealistic approximations ( ots , owo , etc . ) and underestimate the _ diffuse _ ionizing radiation field .",
    "( 2 ) the geometry assumed by these codes is spherically symmetric which is not realistic to model galaxies with three dimensional stellar disks and extended gaseous halos .",
    "hence , photoionization by ob - stars as the main heat source of the dig should not be abandoned , unless realistic pure photoionization models have proven to be unsuccessful in reproducing the observed line ratios .",
    "since the radiative transfer can only be solved correctly by means of statistical methods , a new self - consistent 3d monte carlo ( mc ) code , called _ soap _ ( simulations of astrophysical plasmas ) , has been developed .",
    "mc techniques are a proven means of calculating the radiative transfer in an inhomogeneous medium . as an example",
    ", @xcite and @xcite developed a self - consistent mc code which successfully models the multi - line transfer in the wind of wolf - rayet and other early - type stars .",
    "this model was modified by @xcite in order to self - consistently simulate spherical steady state gaseous nebulae with arbitrary densities .",
    "a comparison of their results with those produced by independent analytical photoionization codes for the standard _",
    "meudon h@xmath0-region _",
    "@xcite evidenced the correctness of the mc model code .    based on this work",
    ", we extended the 1d model grid to 3d , introduced a 3d stellar distribution , assigned individual gas densities to every grid point , and adapted the radiative transfer , correspondingly . as a result , new comprehensive data , such as the ionization structure of h",
    ", he , and heavier ions at high distances above the disk plane as well as first line ratios , could be obtained .",
    "we are aware that the interaction of the radiation field with dust particles is currently neglected .",
    "however , contributions from dust will be modeled as soon as the effects of pure photoionization for different parameter settings are investigated and can be disentangled from a dusty plasma .",
    "before the modeling of gaseous galaxy halos was started , we made sure that the standard _",
    "meudon h@xmath0-region _ results obtained with the och - model could be fully reproduced by _",
    "soap_. a detailed description of the code is given in @xcite .      since we want to investigate the ionization conditions mainly along the @xmath1 direction , cartesian coordinates are used rather than spherical or cylindrical ones .",
    "our model galaxy extends from the center 15kpc in each direction .",
    "the disk is assumed to have a radial extend of 9kpc and a height of 1.5kpc .",
    "the whole geometry is subdivided into 1400 cells , with 10 cells in @xmath2 and @xmath3-direction , respectively , and 14 cells along the @xmath1-axis . except for the disk region",
    "all cells have constant lengths of 1.5kpc and identical volumes . within the disk , there are 5 vertical layers with heights of 100 , 100 , 200 , 400 , and 700pc .",
    "stars are assumed to be present only in a thin disk which occupy the innermost 100pc .",
    "the remaining layers are filled up with gas of pre - selected density and metal abundance . above the disk ,",
    "gas densities are significantly lower and drop exponentially as a function of @xmath1 , the distance above the disk .",
    "although the selected geometry underestimates the radial dimensions of a `` real '' spiral galaxy by a factor of 2 and is only sensitive to changes of the radiation field on scales of 1.5kpc the chosen setup represents the best compromise between spatial resolution and computing time .",
    "_ soap _ has been developed to primarily investigate dig properties in edge - on galaxies .",
    "this would be similar to spectroscopic observations where the slit is aligned along the minor axis of a galaxy . here ,",
    "a typical offset of @xmath4kpc from the galactic center was assumed . at this position , all relevant emission coefficients from recombination and forbidden",
    "lines are summed up and volume averaged along the @xmath3-axis for each of the 14 @xmath1-layers , separately .",
    "a model halo with exponentially decreasing densities is simulated assuming the relative elemental abundances of the _ meudon h@xmath0-region _ ( h=1.0 , he=0.1 , c=2.2@xmath5 , n=4.0@xmath6 , o=3.3@xmath5 , ne=5.0@xmath6 , and s=9.0@xmath7 ) .",
    "densities in the lowermost layer start at @xmath8 and drop to @xmath9@xmath10 at @xmath11kpc .",
    "given the symmetry of the problem , it is sufficient to model only one octant of the galaxy . within the volume occupied by the disk , approximately 640 o6 stars ( blackbody ) are distributed in a thin ( 100pc ) stellar layer with a radius of 9.0kpc .",
    "a typical model run consists of @xmath12150 iterations with 10@xmath13 photons per iteration .",
    "we made sure that the solution remained stable even after 450 model runs .    in figures",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ionization fractions are plotted for the most important elements ( h , he , o , n , and s ) as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath1 . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "only data of 4 disk and 4 halo layers is shown , where each symbol / line addresses a certain distance above the galactic plane .",
    "the ionization structures for h@xmath14 and o@xmath14 are nearly identical due to very similar ionization potentials . for @xmath15kpc ( radial direction )",
    "low fractions indicate that most of the hydrogen and oxygen is ionized . at distances",
    "@xmath16kpc from the center the disk ends and the ionization structures change , implying that h and o are now almost completely neutral .",
    "similar effects are well known in normal hii - regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the steep increase between 7 and 9kpc indicates that all photons are absorbed and can not ionize the gas at larger @xmath3-distances .",
    "this is the equivalent case to the strmgren radius which determines the outer boundary of a classical hii - region .",
    "between @xmath17kpc there is a local minimum in both ionization fractions which demonstrates that h and o are partly ionized .",
    "the reason is most likely due to ionizing photons which are created in the halo and are re - emitted at angles that allow them to reach the galactic plane .",
    "in other words , the diffuse radiation field is responsible for the ionization of the shadowed outer - disk region .",
    "if one moves along the minor axis the corresponding ionization fractions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 become more and more independent from the disk . beyond 9.0kpc the ratios",
    "drop continuously , implying that _ with decreasing densities of the dig , the fraction of ionized gas gets larger_. the corresponding curves for higher ionization stages of o , s , and n also support this finding .",
    "this surprising result is explainable as follows : stellar and diffuse ionizing photons that traversed the disk get dilute as they expand into the halo .",
    "decreasing halo densities lead to decreasing opacities and enable photons to reach the outer halo border .",
    "this in turn implies low recombination rates and higher temperatures in the halo ( cf .",
    "lower left panel of fig .",
    "typical recombination times for hydrogen at gas temperatures of 8000k and densities of about @xmath20@xmath10 yield : @xmath21yr . apparently , the geometric dilution of the radiation field is not a severe obstruction for the photons to ionize nearly all atoms within a given cell volume .",
    "once the gas is ionized , it remains ionized for about 100 million years .",
    "if one considers the constant stream of ionizing photons from the disk it appears likely that recombination time scales are even longer .",
    "nevertheless , dig seems to be far from ionization equilibrium .",
    "the same qualitative results and arguments also apply to heavier ions ( for a discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "high ionization fractions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 close to 1 at large distances from the disk might suggest that the adopted radiation field produced by o6 stars is too hard . changing the spectral type of the ionizing sources to o7 or o8 ,",
    "would restrict the energy distribution function to less energetic photons and lead to a reduced amount of he@xmath24 in the halo without substantially altering the ionization structure of the lower ionization species .",
    "line ratios presented in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] are normalized to h@xmath25 or h@xmath26 and have been computed by summing up the volume averaged line intensities of all cells along the line of sight for each @xmath1-layer .",
    "it turns out that our simple model is well suited to reproduce observed line ratios for ngc891 , especially those of [ oiii]/h@xmath26 and [ oii]/h@xmath26 .",
    "deviations between predicted and observed ratios , as e.g. , visualized in hei@xmath275876/h@xmath25 and [ oi]@xmath276300/h@xmath25 , suggest that the adopted incident radiation field is too hard .",
    "however , pure photoionization by ob - stars seems to be appropriate to explain all observed line ratios consistently .",
    "finally , the photon statistics shown in fig .  [ f4 ] allows to extract the artifical spectrum which leaves the disk and the halo .",
    "this plot also reveals a critical average density of about 8 @xmath28 at which no ionizing radiation escapes the galaxy . below this value ,",
    "a significant fraction of ionizing photons leave the halo and contributes to the intergalactic radiation field .",
    "a quantification of this fraction can be achieved after dust has been modeled in . although estimates @xcite indicate that only a few percent of the ionizing photons contribute to the ionization of the igm , this represents a significant contribution in view of the large number densities of normal spiral galaxies .",
    "first results from a 3d self - consistent monte carlo model that accurately simulates dig in galactic halos with respect to the geometry and the radiative transfer have been presented .",
    "the main conclusions can be summarized as follows :      \\(2 ) all ionization fractions in the disk at @xmath29kpc are in good agreement with predictions from model hii - regions @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the disk can be approximated by a single huge hii - region .",
    "\\(6 ) dig seems to be in an extreme non - equilibrium condition .",
    "+ forthcoming work will involve a comprehensive parameter study in order to investigate the dependence between line ratios , gas densities , stellar photon luminosities , and gas phase abundances .",
    "after dusty plasmas can be simulated , detailed modeling of individual dig properties of well observed galaxies , such as ngc5775 or ngc891 , can be started . in case theory and observations",
    "should reconcile , final proof would be given that photoionization by o stars can serve as the only ionization mechanism of the dig if the physics of radiative transfer is calculated accurately and a realistic geometry is considered .",
