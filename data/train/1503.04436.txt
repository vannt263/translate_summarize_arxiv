    "nearly @xmath7 of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) possess two oppositely - oriented collimated beams which emit photons up to the tev energy range .",
    "when one of the beams is oriented towards us , the agn is called a blazar .    thanks to the observations carried out with the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) like h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , magic  @xcite and veritas  @xcite , according to the tevcat catalog 43 blazars with known redshift have been detected in the very - high - energy ( vhe ) range ( @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "we stress that 40 of them are in the flaring state , whose typical lifetime ranges from a few hours to a few days . as it will explained below , 3 of them 1es 0229 + 200 , pks 1441 + 25 and s3 0218 + 35",
    "will be discarded for the sake of the present analysis .",
    "all observed spectra of the considered vhe blazars are well fitted by a single power - law , and so they have the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the observed energy , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the normalization constant and the observed slope , respectively , for a source at redshift @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , the observational results do not provide any _ direct _ information about the intrinsic properties of the sources , as the vhe gamma - ray data strongly depend on the nature of photon propagation . indeed , according to conventional physics the blazar spectra in the vhe range",
    "are strongly affected by the presence of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , namely the infrared / optical / ultraviolet background photons emitted by all galaxies since their birth ( for a review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that if some yet - to - be - discovered new physics changes the photon propagation , then some intrinsic source properties that are currently believed to be true may actually be incorrect .",
    "we restrict our discussion to the two standard competing models for vhe photon emission by blazars , namely the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) mechanism  @xcite and the hadronic pion production ( hpp ) in proton - proton scattering  @xcite .",
    "both predict emitted spectra which , to a good approximation , have a single power - law behavior @xmath12 for all the considered vhe blazars , where @xmath13 is the normalization constant and @xmath14 is the emitted slope .",
    "the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be expressed in general terms as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the photon survival probability from the source to us , and is usually written in terms of the optical depth @xmath19 as @xmath20    before proceeding , a remark is compelling .",
    "a few years ago , a radically different mechanism has been put forward in order to explain the iact observations . basically , the idea is that _ protons _ are accelerated inside blazars up to energies of order @xmath21 , while vhe emitted photons are neglected altogether .",
    "when the proton distance from the galaxy is in the range @xmath22 , they scatter off ebl photons through the process @xmath23 , so that the immediate decays @xmath24 produce an electromagnetic shower of secondary photons : it is _ these photons _ that replace the emitted photons in such a scenario  @xcite .",
    "two characteristic features of this mechanism should be stressed in connection with the present analysis .",
    "* it is expected this effect to be important for sources at redshifts @xmath25 and energies @xmath26  @xcite . *",
    "observed blazars variability shorter than @xmath27 can be explained only for @xmath28 at @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "now , a glance at the values of @xmath2 for the considered sources reported in table  [ tabsource ] shows that we have 28 blazars with @xmath29 , and so  owing to the first item  these blazars can not be explained by the mechanism in question .",
    "let us next turn to the issue of variability .",
    "the overwhelming majority of the sources considered here are flaring , with a lifetime typically ranging from a few hours to a few days .",
    "only the blazars 1es 0229 + 200 , 1es 0806 + 524 and 1es 1101 - 232 have a constant @xmath30-ray luminosity  @xcite .",
    "a look at the energy range @xmath31 over which each source is observed ( reported in table  [ tabsource ] ) shows that the lowest values of @xmath9 are much below @xmath32 ( with one exception to be addressed below ) . because the shapes of the observed spectra do not exhibit any peculiar feature , it is evident that a _ single",
    "blazar is explained by the a _ single mechanism _",
    ", and so we must conclude that the considered approach can explain at most 3 sources .",
    "thus , here we do not address such an alternative possibility  whose relevance can become important at much larger energies  up to an exception .",
    "an analysis of the properties of the blazar 1es 0229 + 200 has shown that it can hardly be explained by the ssc mechanism .",
    "moreover , since its vhe luminosity is constant , this source is more likely to be explained by the proton emission model  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we discard it from our discussion .    the main issue we are concerned with in this paper is a possible correlation between the distribution of blazar vhe _ emitted spectra _ and the _",
    "redshift_.    superficially , the reader might well wonder about such a question .",
    "why should a correlation of this kind exist ?",
    "cosmological evolutionary effects are certainly harmless out to redshift @xmath33 , and when observational selection biases are properly taken into account no such a correlation is expected to show up .",
    "as we shell see , this is not the case , and it is indeed this fact that has prompted our analysis .",
    "we are now in position to outline the structure of the paper . in section",
    "ii we report all observational information needed for the present analysis .",
    "section iii is devoted to inferring for each considered source the emitted slope @xmath34 and the emitted flux normalization @xmath35 starting from the observed ones @xmath11 and @xmath10 assuming conventional physics , namely taking into account the effect of the ebl absorption alone .",
    "we next plot the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 as a function of redshift @xmath2 for all considered blazars . after performing a statistical analysis of the @xmath36 distribution",
    ", we end up with the conclusion that the resulting best - fit regression line _ decreases with increasing redshift_. while this trend might be interpreted as an observational selection effect , a deeper scrutiny based on observational information shows that this is by no means the case .",
    "so , we are led to the conclusion that such a behavior is at odd with physical intuition , which would instead demand the best - fit regression line to be redshift - independent . in section",
    "iv we try to fit the same data in the @xmath37 plane with a horizontal straight line , but we conclude that it does not work . as an attempt to achieve a physically satisfactory scenario , in section v we introduce axion - like particles ( alp ) ( for a review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "they are spin - zero , neutral and extremely light pseudo - scalar bosons predicted by several extensions of the standard model of particle physics , and especially by those based on superstring theories  @xcite .",
    "they interact only with two photons . depending on their mass and two - photon coupling",
    ", they can be quite good candidates for cold dark matter  @xcite and give rise to very interesting astrophysical effects ( to be discussed in section vi ) , so that nowadays alps are attracting growing interest .",
    "specifically , we suppose that photon - alp oscillations take place in extragalactic magnetic fields of strength about @xmath38  in agreement with the predictions of the galactic outflows models  @xcite  as first proposed in  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "photon propagation gets affected by ebl as well as by photon - alp oscillations , whose combined effect is to _ substantially reduce _ the cosmic opacity brought about by the ebl alone , thereby considerably widening the conventional @xmath30-ray horizon  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we re - derive for every source the emitted slope @xmath39 and the emitted flux normalization @xmath40 starting from the observed ones @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "proceeding as before , we plot again the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 as a function of redshift @xmath2 for all considered sources .",
    "a statistical analysis of the @xmath41 distribution now shows that for a realistic choice of the parameters the corresponding best - fit regression line turns out to be indeed _ independent _ of redshift .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath39 for the individual blazars exhibit a small scatter about such a best - fit straight regression line .",
    "we stress that the fact that the best - fit regression becomes a straight line horizontal in the @xmath42 plane is an amazing fact , which is the only one in agreement with physical intuition and provides a strong hint of the existence of alps . finally , in section vi we briefly discuss a new view of vhe blazars emerging from our result , its relevance  also in connection with other vhe astrophysical achievements employing alps  and its implications for the future of vhe astrophysics .",
    "finally , in order to avoid breaking the main line of thought by somewhat involved technicalities concerning the evaluation of the photon survival probability in the presence of alps , we report this matter in the appendix .",
    "the observational quantities concerning every blazar which are relevant for the present analysis are : the redshift @xmath2 , the observed flux @xmath15 and the energy range @xmath31 where each source is observed .",
    "some care should be payed to the normalization constant entering the expression of @xmath15 , which is usually written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an arbitrary energy value needed to make the exponential dimensionless , and in general _ varies _ from source to source .",
    "manifestly , for the sake of comparison among the flux normalization constants for the different sources we have to recast eq .",
    "( [ a313 ] ) into a form such that @xmath44 gets replaced by a quantity which is equal for all sources . choosing as a fiducial normalization energy @xmath45",
    ", it amounts to defining the new normalization constant as @xmath46 so that eq .",
    "( [ a313 ] ) becomes @xmath47 note that we have @xmath48 .",
    "henceforth , we shall deal exclusively with the values of @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , we need to know both @xmath49 and @xmath11 for any source .    the values of @xmath2 , @xmath11 , @xmath31 and @xmath49 for all considered blazars are reported in table  [ tabsource ] .",
    "observe that while the error bars associated with @xmath11 are quoted , those referring to @xmath49 are not because of their lack in many of the published papers , but for our consideration this is not a big problem ( nevertheless , the reader should keep this point in mind throughout the paper ) . the observed slope @xmath50 and the normalization constant @xmath51 as a function of @xmath2 are plotted in the left and right panels of fig .",

    "incidentally , we neglect error bars in the values of @xmath63 because they are not quoted by frv .",

    "[ fig2 ] but with superimposed the best - fit straight regression line given by eq .",
    "[ a31427 ] . ]",
    "actually , one of the effects of the obtained best - fit straight regression line is that blazars with harder spectra are found _ only _ at larger redshift .",
    "what is the _ physical meaning _ of this fact ?",
    "since we have intentionally neglected the two blazars pks 1441 + 25 and s3 0218 + 35 both at @xmath79 , our set of sources extends up to @xmath80 ( 3c 279 ) .",

    "[ fig2r.pdf ] would naturally arise provided that @xmath67 _ tightly correlates _ with @xmath34 in such a way that _",

[ fig2r.pdf ] entails .    in order to get a deeper insight into the issue addressed in the second item , we proceed by plotting @xmath82 versus @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fluxvsslopecp ] .",
    "we see that @xmath82 and @xmath70 are _ totally uncorrelated_. as a consequence , the cheap explanation outlined in the second item concerning the behavior of the best - fit straight regression line in fig .",
    "[ fig2r.pdf ] is doomed to failure .",
    "@xmath82 is plotted versus @xmath70 . ]    finally , the possibility contemplated in the third item can also be excluded very easily by comparing the values of @xmath34 as reported in table  [ tabgammal4 ] with those estimated for @xmath81 in  @xcite .",
    "what turns out is that no correlation whatsoever between @xmath81 and @xmath34 exists .",
    "it is very difficult to imagine an intrinsic mechanism which could explain the best - fit straight regression line in fig .",
    "[ fig2r.pdf ] in a physically satisfactory way within conventional physics",
    ". otherwise stated , how can a source get to know its redshift @xmath2 in such a way to adjust its emitted slope @xmath34 so as to reproduce the distribution with best - fit straight regression line reported in fig .",
    "[ fig2r.pdf ] ?",
    "we are therefore led to regard the situation emerging from the above discussion as in manifest disagreement with physical intuition , which would instead demand the best - fit straight regression line to be _ horizontal _ in the @xmath37 plane .",
    "in spite of our previous finding , let us nevertheless try to _ impose by hand _ that the same data set @xmath36 considered before is fitted by a horizontal straight line , and see what happens .",
    "the result is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in this case , we have @xmath83 and @xmath73 .    manifestly , this scenario does not work , since the value of @xmath72 is unduly large .",
    "this fact hardly comes as a surprise , since we are not best - fitting the data .",
    "still , this is a useful exercise , since it quantifies the price we have to pay in order to have a horizontal fitting straight line within conventional physics , and will be a benchmark for comparison when the alp scenario will be considered .",
    "much for the same reason , it is instructive to encompass @xmath84 of the observed sources inside a strip centered on the horizontal fitting line @xmath83 .",

    "as an alternative possibility to achieve a physically satisfactory situation , we invoke new physics in the form of axion - like particles ( alps ) .",
    "as discussed in the appendix , their most characteristic feature is to couple only to two photons with a coupling constant @xmath88 according to the feynman diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ feyalp ] . clearly , in the presence of the extragalactic magnetic field @xmath89 one photon line in fig .  [ feyalp ] represents the @xmath89 field , and so we see that in such a situation energy - conserving oscillations between vhe photons and alps take place  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , photons acquire a split personality , traveling for some time as real photons  which suffer ebl absorption  and for some time as alps , which are unaffected by the ebl ( as explicitly shown in the appendix ) . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath19 gets replaced by the effective optical depth @xmath90 , which is manifestly _ smaller _ than @xmath19 and is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath9 and @xmath2 .",
    "the crux of the argument is that since the photon survival probability is now @xmath91 , even a _ small _ decrease of @xmath90 with respect to @xmath57 gives rise to a _",
    "large _ increase of the photon survival probability , as compared to the case of conventional physics .",
    "so , the main consequence of photon - alp oscillations is to _ substantially attenuate _ the ebl absorption and consequently to considerably enlarging the conventional @xmath30-ray horizon  @xcite .",
    "actually , @xmath92 can be computed exactly as outlined in the appendix , where it is explained that the extragalactic magnetic field likely has a domain - like structure ( at least in first approximation ) , namely that @xmath89 is homogeneous over a domain of size @xmath93 and has approximately the same strength @xmath94 in all domains , but its direction randomly changes from one domain to the next  @xcite ( more about this , in the appendix ) .",
    "furthermore , it will be shown that the considered alp scenario contains only two free parameters @xmath95 and @xmath93 : they obviously show up in @xmath92 even though such a dependence is not explicitly exhibited for notational simplicity .",
