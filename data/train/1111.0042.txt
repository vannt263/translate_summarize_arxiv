    "ls i + 61 303 is a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) that consists of an optical star with spectral type b0 ve and an unknown compact companion in a highly eccentric , 26.5 day orbit @xcite . while the system has a relatively low x - ray luminosity for a hmxb , ls i + 61 303 is the 15th brightest @xmath0-ray source included in the _ fermi _ lat 1-year point source catalogue ( @xcite ) . the be disk interacts with the compact companion , producing emission that has been observed to vary with orbital phase at every wavelength across the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio to tev ( eg .  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found periodic radio outbursts that peak near @xmath2 , and they defined the arbitrary reference for zero phase at hjd 2,443,366.775 that remains the conventional definition for ls i + 61 303 .",
    "periastron occurs at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "during 2008 october and november , we performed an intense multiwavelength observing campaign on ls i + 61 303 supported by a _",
    "cycle 1 program .",
    "we obtained optical h@xmath1 spectra of ls i + 61 303 at the kpno coud feed telescope over 35 consecutive nights to study the evolution of the emission during a complete orbit @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath1 line profile exhibits a dramatic emission burst near @xmath4 , observed as a redshifted shoulder in the line profile ( see fig .",
    "[ gray ] ) as the compact source moves almost directly away from the observer .",
    "smaller temporal changes in the red spectra suggest additional h@xmath1 emission variability , so we subtracted the mean emission line profile to investigate the residuals carefully ( see fig .",
    "[ diff ] ) .",
    "during about half of the orbit , @xmath5 , the difference spectra reveal a partial s - shaped pattern similar to a spiral density wave that is commonly observed in be star disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite also observed a strong blue peak near @xmath6 , which supports the development of a spiral density wave near periastron .",
    "after this phase , the peculiar red shoulder develops .",
    "we measured the equivalent width of h@xmath1 , @xmath7 , for each spectrum by directly integrating over the line profile .",
    "( we use the convention that @xmath7 is negative for an emission line . )",
    "the errors in @xmath7 are typically about 10% due to noise and placement of the continuum .",
    "figure [ eqwidth ] shows that during our coud feed run , @xmath7 decreased slightly just before periastron .",
    "since @xmath7 is correlated to the radius of a be star s circumstellar disk @xcite , we interpret the decline in emission as a slight decrease in disk radius as gas is stripped away by the compact companion .",
    "@xmath7 then rises dramatically with the onset of the red shoulder emission component near @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ eqwidth ] also compares our recent @xmath7 with those measured by @xcite .",
    "their data were accumulated over six different observing runs over 19982000 , and the long term differences in emission strength are substantial .",
    "also during 2008 october and november , g.  pooley obtained nearly simultaneous radio flux coverage with the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) array .",
    "the 15 ghz ami light curve ( fig .",
    "[ radio ] ) reveals emission that peaks at the same time as the h@xmath1 `` red shoulder '' outburst .",
    "contemporaneous _ rxte _",
    "light curves from @xciteand _ fermi _ light curves ( @xcite ) also reveal orbitally modulated emission that peaks just before the h@xmath1 red shoulder , although their wide phase bins may mask a true correlation .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission clearly traces the high energy emission region in this system .",
    "the unusual broadness of the h@xmath1 red shoulder emission is consistent with a balmer - dominated shock ( bds ; @xcite ) .",
    "bds are traditionally observed around supernova remnants but are also sometimes produced within pulsar wind nebulae and other evolved stellar systems .",
    "they form when high velocity ( 2009000 km s@xmath8 ) shocks collide with the interstellar medium , manifesting themselves as optically emitting filaments .",
    "energetic particles and/or photons may be generated in the post - shock region of the collisionless , non - radiative shock .",
    "direct collisional excitation of the pre - shock atoms produces a narrow emission line component that reflects thermal conditions within the pre - shock gas .",
    "if the energetic particles exceed the shock velocity , the pre - shock hydrogen atoms also exchange electrons with post - shock protons , manifesting themselves as broad neutral hydrogen lines ( widths @xmath9 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the h@xmath1 line structure in ls i + 61 303 is complicated by the superposition of emission from the circumstellar disk ; however , the broad red shoulder is consistent with such a bds .",
    "the temporary nature of the red shoulder , as well as the correlated gev ",
    "radio emission , suggests that the bds only forms when a high density tidal mass stream interacts with a pulsar wind in ls i + 61 303 .",
    "we thank di harmer and the staff at kpno for their hard work to schedule and support the coud feed observations .",
    "guy pooley , christina aragona , tabetha boyajian , amber marsh , and rachael roettenbacher helped collect the data presented here and should be cheered for their heroic efforts .",
    "this work is supported by nasa dpr numbers nnx08av70 g , nng08e1671 , nnx09at67 g , and an institutional grant from lehigh university ."
