    "controlling the dynamics of quantum systems is a problem of great recent interest with many applications from quantum chemistry to quantum computing . since the dynamics of a quantum system",
    "is essentially determined by its hamiltonian , a central theme in quantum control is hamiltonian engineering .",
    "this is typically accomplished by the application of external fields , whose interaction with the system modifies its effective hamiltonian , thereby changing its dynamical evolution .",
    "the type of control fields that are available tends to vary significantly depending on the type of system and the actuators available . in traditional applications such as nuclear spin engineering and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , the fields are often radiofrequency pulses , while in applications involving transitions between electronic states in atoms or vibrational modes of molecules , the control fields are usually laser pulses . in more recent applications such as various solid - state architectures based on semi - conductor quantum dots or josephson junctions , the controls are often electric fields produced by external electrodes . despite the disparate physical realizations , all of these applications share important similarities , in that the external fields modify the hamiltonian in a certain way , and",
    "the objective generally is to find a particular control that modifies the dynamics in a certain way , and achieves a certain objective , e.g. , of steering the system to a particular state or realizing a desired quantum process .",
    "there are many differences in the specifics , however , which can be very important for the design of effective and experimentally feasible controls . in nmr applications , for example , we can often approximate the system well by assuming that the control fields induce rapid local rotations of individual spins , which interact through a fixed , weak coupling between them that is not affected by the control fields .",
    "furthermore , we can often assume that we can selectively address individual spins by frequency - selective control pulses , and that we can perform local rotations about orthogonal axes .",
    "the same approximations , however , are not necessarily valid for other systems such as solid - state architectures . in particular for systems controlled by local voltage gates , it is often difficult to perform rotations about orthogonal axes , and a voltage applied to a local electrode may have non - negligible effects on the dynamics of nearby quantum dots , and in the presence of multiple control voltages there can be signficant cross - talk effects , all of which can signficantly complicate effective control design . in this paper",
    "we attempt to incorporate some of these effects to derive more realistic control system models for two types of systems of practical interest , and apply optimal control theory to find control solutions to implement a set of elementary gates for the resulting more complex control system models .",
    "the starting point for many optimal control problems in quantum computing such as optimal implementation of quantum gates has often been a control system model inspired by liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) . using the common shorthand @xmath1 to denote an @xmath2-factor tensor product in which the @xmath3th factor is the pauli matrix @xmath4 for @xmath5 and all other factors are the identity @xmath6 , the hamiltonian for a system consisting of @xmath2 spin-@xmath7 nuclei ( qubits ) in this model is usually given by @xmath8            = \\hbar\\sum_{n < n ' } j_{nn ' } \\sz^{(n ) } \\sz^{(n ' ) }            + \\hbar\\sum_{n=1}^n \\left(u_{2n-1}(t)\\sx^{(n ) }             + u_{2n}(t)\\sy^{(n)}\\right),\\ ] ] where the first term is a fixed inter - qubit coupling term , in this case of ising type , and we have @xmath9 independent control fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 capable of performing local @xmath12 and @xmath13 rotations on the @xmath3th spin , respectively .",
    "if the interqubit couplings @xmath14 are controllable , or at least can be switched off , then it is very easy to see that we can implement any local unitary operation @xmath15 on the @xmath3th qubit , e.g. , by performing a sequence of three local rotations about the orthogonal axes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , e.g. , using the standard euler decomposition @xmath18 with @xmath19 , etc , for suitable values of the rotation angles @xmath20 , and two - qubit gates can be implemented using the cartan decomposition  @xcite , @xmath21\\ ,              [ \\op{u}_x^{-1}\\ , \\op{z}(\\alpha_2 ) \\ , \\op{u}_x]\\ ,              \\op{z}(\\alpha_1 ) \\ , \\op{u}_2,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 corresponds to free evolution under the ising - coupling hamiltonian for a suitable time , @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to local operations on both qubits , which can be implemented using the euler decomposition , and @xmath25 correspond to local @xmath12-rotations by @xmath26 on both qubits , and similarly for @xmath27 .",
    "if the inter - qubit coupling terms @xmath14 are fixed and not controllable then this gives rise to a drift term , which complicates the situation .",
    "if the coupling is weak and we can apply `` hard pulses '' , e.g. , if we can ensure @xmath28 then the drift term is negligible ( as far as the implementation of local gates is concerned ) , and the geometric control pulse sequences derived from the euler and cartan decomposition are often a good approximation .",
    "however , if the coupling is stronger or hard pulses are not available , neglecting the drift term will result in inaccurate gates . moreover , in realistic applications , hard pulses may lead to other problems such as off - resonant excitation .",
    "although we can in principle try to find geometric decompositions that take the drift term into account  @xcite , geometric control pulse sequences derived from lie group decompositions are usually not optimal even when the drift is negligible , and optimal control has been shown to be able to produce more effective or efficient control pulses with regard to various perfomance indices such as gate operation timesor average fidelity even for cases where geometric decompositions are valid , at least theoretically [ see e.g.  @xcite ] .",
    "the success of optimal control theory in finding more effective control pulse sequences for various model problems has fueled a surge of interest in this area .",
    "however , the control system models on which many of the optimal control calculations so far have been based are generally too simple and often unrealisitc for the systems they are supposed to model . the model described in the previous section , for example , is based on many approximations that may be questionable even in nmr settings , and certainly for other applications .",
    "for instance , in the ideal case the control fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 induce only an @xmath12-rotation and @xmath13-rotation , respectively , on the @xmath3th qubit , but the desire to speed up gate implementation times may produce strong control fields likely to induce off - resonant excitations not accounted for the in model .",
    "off - resonant excitation means that the fields are not only felt by the target qubit but also by other qubits . in the simplest case we can try to model off - resonant excitation by replacing the individual interaction hamiltonians @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the independent control fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 by linear combinations of the coupling terms    [ eq : lin_xtalk ] @xmath29    the new interaction hamiltonians @xmath30 for @xmath31 no longer correspond to local rotations about mutually orthogonal axes , which makes finding geometric decompositions for this case very challenging in general .",
    "however , even arbitrary ( linear ) cross - talk need not be an obstacle for optimal control as shown in  @xcite for a model system of this type .",
    "provided the cross - talk hamiltonians are known , based on a combination of theoretical models and experimental characterization , it still appears to easy to find effective control pulses using optimal control algorithms .",
    "the main drawback is that this simple model does not accurately model real cross - talk .",
    "the intrisic system hamiltonian for a system of @xmath2 spins with resonance frequencies @xmath32 with static ising coupling @xmath14 in a fixed laboratory frame is @xmath33 if we apply a global electromagntic field @xmath34 with components @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , the resulting control hamiltonian is @xmath37\\ ] ] transforming to a multiply rotating frame defined by @xmath38 , the interaction picture rotating wave approximation hamiltonian is  @xcite @xmath39\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "it is questionable , however , whether these approximations are still valid in general , especially if we simultaneously apply @xmath9 control fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 , all of which may be strongly modulated in time as a result of an optimization procedure , and thus not slowly varying .",
    "furthermore , the interaction picture rwa hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sys1c ] ) is not a very good starting point for a general optimization either because each of the independent control hamiltonians @xmath58\\ ] ] with @xmath59 for a field @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , in the total hamiltonian @xmath63 is time - dependent , containing rapidly oscillating sine and cosine terms .",
    "therefore , we might as well let the component functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the field be completely arbitrary and work with the general hamiltonian @xmath66 with @xmath67 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sys1a ] ) , instead .      in some applications such as nmr the only type of control",
    "we have is globally applied control fields . however ,",
    "for many systems , especially solid - state systems such as the nuclear spins of donor atoms embedded in a substrate  @xcite , or electron spins in quantum dots  @xcite , for example , some local control in the form of control electrodes is available , and in a typical setting , control is achieved by combining globally applied electromagnetic fields with local fields provides by control electrodes  @xcite . in this case",
    "we often have a global electromagnetic field @xmath34 with components @xmath68 , @xmath69 , in addition to a static magnetic field in the @xmath70 direction , and a hamiltonian of the form @xmath71 ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] as before , but in addition we now have some degree of control over the resonance frequency @xmath32 of the @xmath3th qubit via local control electrodes .",
    "note that unlike in the previous model we have assumed isotropic heisenberg coupling , i.e. , @xmath72 , instead of @xmath73 ising coupling as this seems to be more appropriate for solid - state systems , although the assumption of isotropy may not be appropriate for some systems .",
    "one control approach is to simultaneously vary the voltages applied to the local control electrodes as well as the globally applied field .",
    "however , it practice it is much simpler to apply a global field @xmath34 with a fixed amplitude @xmath74 and fixed frequency @xmath44 and only vary the voltages applied to the local control electrodes . in this case",
    "we can introduce a rotating frame , this time rotating at the field frequency @xmath44 , @xmath75 , to obtain the slightly simpler interaction picture hamiltonian @xmath76 where we set @xmath77 and take @xmath78 to be the coupling constants @xmath79 in units of some coupling strength @xmath80 , so that for a homogeneous system consisting of a chain of spins that couple identically to the field we have @xmath81 for @xmath82 .    in this model the constants @xmath14 and @xmath79 are usually fixed and determined by the physics of the system .",
    "the frequency @xmath44 and rabi frequency @xmath83 of the field can be chosen initially but are then fixed .",
    "thus , all the dynamic control is achieved by dynamically changing the control voltages and thus @xmath84 .",
    "this type of control therefore leads to a different partitioning of the total hamiltonian into a fixed drift and variable control part @xmath85 in general , due to cross - talk effects  @xcite the energy level shift of the @xmath3th qubit may be a complicated function of all the voltages applied , not only to the electrode directly above it , but to neighbouring control electrodes as well , i.e. , @xmath32 may be a function of all the control voltages @xmath86 applied , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "one way to solve the problem of finding controls @xmath88 that implement a desired set of quantum gates , especially for control systems that are not amenable to simple geometric decomposition schemes , such as the ones discussed in the previous section , is to formulate the task as an optimization problem .",
    "this typically involves ( a ) choosing a target function to be optimized , ( b ) finding a suitable parametrization for the set of admissible ( and experimentally feasible ) controls , and ( c ) finding a solution to the resulting , possibly constrained , optimization problem based on application of pontryagin s maximum principle  @xcite .    for the task of implementation of quantum gates or processes , a natural choice for the objective function",
    "is the gate fidelity  @xcite @xmath89 the reason for the factor of @xmath90 , where @xmath2 is the system dimension , is to ensure that @xmath91 varies between @xmath92 ( for @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 ( for @xmath95 ) independent of the system dimension . in general , maximizing the gate fidelity is equivalent to minmizing the gate error @xmath96 this is very to see if the target operator @xmath97 and the actual operator @xmath98 are both unitary ( and thus @xmath99 ) as @xmath100 \\\\     & = \\tr[\\op{u}^\\dagger\\op{u } + \\op{u}_t^\\dagger\\op{u}_t          -\\op{u}^\\dagger\\op{u}_t -\\op{u}_t^\\dagger \\op{u } ] \\\\     & = 2n - 2\\re\\tr(\\op{u}_t^\\dagger\\op{u } ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] noting that the implemented operator @xmath101 is a function of the control @xmath102 , the control objective is to find an admissible control @xmath103 such that @xmath104 and of course , @xmath105 has to satisfy the schrodinger equation @xmath106 \\op{u}_{\\vec{u}}(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath107 $ ] is the control - dependent hamiltonian of the system .",
    "once the hamiltonian @xmath107 $ ] , the target time @xmath108 and the target operator @xmath97 have been chosen , the fidelity depends only on the choice of the control @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath109 now let @xmath102 and @xmath110 be two controls . noting that @xmath111 and that for a control - linear hamiltonian @xmath107=\\op{h}_0+\\sum_m u_m(t ) \\op{h}_m$ ] we have @xmath112 we obtain immediately @xmath113\\\\ & = \\frac{2}{n\\hbar }       \\im \\tr \\left[\\op{u}_t^\\dagger\\int_{t_0}^{t_f }              \\op{u}_{\\vec{u}}(t_f , t )      \\sum_m \\delta u_m(t ) \\op{h}_m \\op{u}_{\\vec{u}+\\delta\\vec{u}}(t)\\ , dt \\right ] \\\\ & = \\frac{2}{n\\hbar } \\sum_m \\int_{t_0}^{t_f } \\delta u_m(t )       \\im \\tr \\left[\\op{u}_t^\\dagger              \\op{u}_{\\vec{u}}(t_f , t )              \\op{h}_m \\op{u}_{\\vec{u}+\\delta\\vec{u}}(t)\\right ] \\ , dt \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows that setting @xmath114\\ ] ] with @xmath115 for all @xmath116 will increase the fidelity .",
    "thus , starting with any initial guess @xmath117 , iteratively solving the schrodinger equation while updating the control in each iteration according to the rule @xmath118 , with @xmath119 chosen as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltau ] ) , will monotonically increase the fidelity in each iteration , and as the fidelity is of course bounded , the iteration must converge to some limiting fidelity @xmath120 , although we can not guarantee that the limiting value will be equal to the global maximum of the fidelity .",
    "in fact , many optimal control algorithms are based precisely on this iterative update scheme .      to solve the schrodinger equation numerically",
    ", we still require some discretization .",
    "the simplest approach is to assume piecewise constant fields @xmath121 for @xmath122 , in which case the exact solution of the schrodinger equation is explicitly @xmath123 where @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126\\ ] ] is a simple matrix exponential and the update rule becomes @xmath127.\\ ] ] with this type of discretization there are two ways of implementing the update rule . in the global update approach all the matrix exponentials for all times",
    "@xmath128 are evaluated to solve the schrodinger equation , and the fields are updated for all times @xmath128 simultaneously at the end of each iteration step .",
    "this is essentially the well - known grape algorithm as described in  @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to update the fields @xmath129 at each time step @xmath128 .",
    "our analysis above shows that both approaches will monotonically increase the fidelity provided @xmath130 for all @xmath128 , although they will tend to converge to different solutions for the fields .    in our limited numerical experiments for the systems considered here",
    ", both approaches seemed equally effective in finding satisfactory control fields but the local update approach tended to converge faster in terms of the computational time required to find a solution .",
    "the main reason for this appears to be that in the local update approach only a single @xmath131 is incremented at a time , and hence we can optimize the multiplier @xmath132 with very little computational overhead to speed up the convergence , as any local change of @xmath132 requires only re - evaluation of a single matrix exponential ( and two matrix multiplications and a trace operation ) to assess its effect on the fidelity , while in the global update any change in @xmath133 requires the re - evaluation of all the @xmath134 matrix exponentials and @xmath135 matrix multiplications to assess the fidelity of the new control .",
    "an alternative to this simple step - size control is to use higher derivatives to predict the optimal step - size but this also involves potentially significant computational overhead to find the best step size , in addition to the need to calculate analytical expressions for these derivates , thus it is not clear if this will yield a computational advantage or not , although it is worth investigating .",
    "a general shortcoming of this simple optimization procedure is that it does not take constraints into account or include penalities for less desirable fields .",
    "simple constraints such as upper bounds on the field amplitudes can easily be incorporated into the algorithm .",
    "more complex constraints such as limiting the frequency bandwidth of pulses or minimizing the overall pulse energies etc require augmentation of the objective functional by constraint or penalty terms and modifications to the update rules . for some types of penalty terms iterative algorithms very similar to the algorithm above exist [ see e.g.  @xcite ] , but a detailed discussion of appropriate penalty functions , resulting iterative update rules , and comparison of the resulting optimal fields is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the specific task we wish to accomplish here is finding controls @xmath88 that implement the following complete set of universal gates ( i.e. , target operators ) @xmath136 for a two - qubit system , where we employ the common appreviations @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the phase factor for the @xmath140 is necessary to ensure that the target operators are in @xmath141 since our model hamiltonians have zero trace and hence can only generate operators in @xmath141 . as a second ,",
    "more challenging task we consider the implementation of the toffoli - like three - qubit gate @xmath142    for the simulations we assume uniform nearest - neighbour coupling , i.e. , @xmath143 .",
    "since the coupling constants @xmath144 in our model have units of frequency , by choosing time in units of @xmath145 , we can set the coupling constants to unity . all other frequencies , unless otherwise states , are also chosen in units of @xmath144 .",
    "we can furthermore choose the units of energy such that @xmath146 , which has units of energy @xmath147 time , equals @xmath148 , and can thus be omitted .",
    "for the two - qubit gates we set the target gate operation time to @xmath149 , while for the three - qubit gate we choose @xmath150 as a toffoli gate normally requires five two - qubit gates .",
    "we choose these values as reasonable target times although we were able to find solutions for smaller @xmath108 for many gates , suggesting that the gate operation times could in fact be improved .      for our first model system with hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) , assuming @xmath151 for all @xmath3 , and setting @xmath152 and @xmath153 , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath154 for a two - qubit system , and for a three - qubit system we have @xmath155    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the actual control field solutions for a system with @xmath156 and @xmath157 , i.e. , a system with ising coupling frequency about 10% of the smaller qubit frequency , i.e. , strong enough to be non - negligible for single qubit operations , and a qubit frequency difference large enough to allow some selectivity but still small enough so that off - resonant excitation is a concern for pulses of the magnitude and duration required for to achieve the desired gate operation times . for this model system",
    "we choose a relatively large number of time steps , @xmath158 , motivated by the assumption that the @xmath12 and @xmath13 components of the globally applied electromagnetic field could be varied more or less arbitarily , although simulations suggest that we can find piecewise constant solutions with much fewer steps , if necessary .",
    "the solutions are not unique and in fact different initial fields or update rules generally produce different solutions . again , despite the increased complexity of the model ( off - resonant excitation , no rwa ) and the reduced number of control fields ( two vs four in the simpler model  ( [ eq : sys0 ] ) ) , it appeared easy to find solutions that achieved the target fidelity of @xmath159 , or gate errors @xmath160% . however , as the figure shows , the magnitudes of the fields for at least some of the gates are relatively large .",
    "further analysis also shows that the spectral range of the optimal controls produced by this algorithm tends to be rather broad , which may be a concern in practice when there are bandwidth limitations as filtering of high or low frequency components will reduce the gate fidelity .",
    "some numerical simulations for related problems suggest that solutions with much lower spectral bandwidth often exist but it appears that a different parametrization of the fields and optimization approach are required to find such solutions .",
    "finding controls to implement the three - qubit gate proved more of a challenge for this system , in part because convergence was extremely slow .",
    "[ fig](left ) shows a solution with fidelity @xmath161% .",
    "notice that the fields have high amplitudes and are very noisy .",
    "[ fig4](left ) also shows that the fields have very large spectral bandwidth as expected , which would make faithful implementation in the laboratory challenging .      for our second model system with hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sys2 ] ) , assuming again @xmath151 for all @xmath3 , and setting @xmath162 for @xmath163 , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath164 for a two - qubit system , and for a three - qubit system we have @xmath165 notice that we take @xmath166 to be independent controls here to circumvent the complex and highly architecture specific problem of mapping the actual control voltages @xmath167 onto the frequency shifts @xmath84 , although it must be stressed that optimal control solutions for @xmath88 will only be useful for a specific system if the @xmath88 can be actually realized through proper choice of the voltages , which is likely to impose additional , non - trivial constraints .",
    "again , we chose target gate operation times of @xmath149 and @xmath150 for the two- and three - qubit gates , respectively , but in this case we tried to minimize the number of steps @xmath134 , assuming that frequent switching of the control voltages would be experimentally more challenging and increase errors . as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows for @xmath168 ( in units of @xmath144 ) we were able to find satisfactory solutions for all six two - qubit gates with only @xmath169 switches .",
    "we note that @xmath170 appeared to be optimal in the sense that we had to increase @xmath134 significantly for larger or smaller values of @xmath83 . for @xmath171 ,",
    "for example , we had to increase the number of steps to @xmath172 and double the target time to be able to implement the first five two - qubit gates ( corresponding to local operations ) with fidelity @xmath173 , and for the final cnot gate the fidelity we achieved was still only @xmath174 , i.e. , below threshold .",
    "for @xmath175 we were able to find solutions above threshold fidelity for all target gates for @xmath176 ; for @xmath169 the fidelity of the cnot gate remained below threshold ( @xmath177% ) . similarly , for @xmath178 we were able to find solutions above the threshold fidelity for all gates for @xmath176 but not for @xmath169 .",
    "for even larger @xmath83 , such as @xmath179 or @xmath180 , @xmath134 had to be increased to @xmath179 , and for @xmath83 in the 50 - 60 range @xmath181 steps were required .",
    "these results can be partially explained considering that if @xmath83 is on the order of the fixed coupling strengths then the weight of the drift term makes it harder to implement local operations hence the increase in the time required . for large @xmath83 local operations",
    "become easier to implement but entangling gates such as the cnot , which rely on generation of entanglment via the fixed ising coupling term , become more challenging , requiring more complex pulse shapes , hence necessitating a larger number of steps @xmath134 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for this system we had no trouble finding solutions to implement the three - qubit gate with fidelity @xmath161% .",
    "a possible solution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](right ) .",
    "although the pulse profiles appear more complicated , their magnitudes are actually lower than for some of the two - qubit gates , and although @xmath181 , the number of switches per time unit is still only @xmath182 . unlike for the previous model fig .",
    "[ fig4](right ) shows that the spectral profile and bandwidth of the solutions are much more desirable .",
    "starting with the most basic control system model commonly used in applications such as ( liquid - state ) nmr , we have derived more realistic control system models for two types of control of special interest for many applications : ( a ) control of qubits with fixed inter - qubit coupling using globally applied electromagnetic fields in the regime where off - resonant excitation by the control fields is non - negligible , and ( b ) control of qubits with fixed coupling using a combination of a fixed globally applied control field and local control electrodes to shift the resonance frequencies of the qubits . despite the substantially increased complexity of the resulting models , reduced number of independent controls , and non - trivial constraints on the allowed frequency of voltage changes in the latter model , optimal control techniques even in the rather basic form implemented , overall still proved very effective in finding solutions that achieved the target fidelity of @xmath183% for almost all cases , although there appears to be scope for further improving the controls with regard to amplitude and bandwidth considerations , and for improving the overall convergence of the algorithm , which even with some of the modifications discussed , appears to be rather slow especially for the three - qubit gates .",
    "a somewhat unexpected conclusion of the calculations is that our second model system , which is controlled mainly by local voltage gates that can only alter the detuning of the qubits from the fixed ( unmodulated ) global field appears to be easier to control , even when constraints on the number of voltage changes are imposed , than the first model system , which is controlled by global fields with arbitrary pulse envelopes .",
