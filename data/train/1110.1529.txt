    "galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally collapsed objects in the universe . historically , the kinematical study of the coma cluster provided the first indication for the existence of dark matter  @xcite .",

    "e.g. _  in stellar rotation curves of spiral galaxies or as baryon acoustic oscillations imprinted in the cosmic microwave background ( for reviews on particle dark matter see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . by now , the @xmath5cdm scenario is the standard framework for cosmology , leaving open the question of what the nature of the dark matter particles is .",
    "theoretical models for dark matter predict a large variety of possible non - gravitational signatures that would help to reveal its properties . however , despite lots of efforts , none of these signals has been unambiguously detected so far .",
    "if dark matter is made out of wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) , their efficient self - annihilation in the early universe would explain the observed dark matter density .",
    "today , the same annihilation process could contribute to the measured cosmic - ray fluxes ; a clear detection of the annihilation products would reveal information about the dark matter particle s mass and interactions .",
    "similar signatures could be produced if dark matter is unstable and decays , providing us with information on the lifetime of the dark matter particle .",
    "indirect searches for dark matter are aiming at seeing such annihilation or decay signals above the astrophysical backgrounds .",
    "these searches typically concentrate on photons or neutrinos , which carry spatial and spectral information about their origin , and on different anti - matter species with their relatively low astrophysical backgrounds .",
    "together with satellite galaxies of the milky way  @xcite and the galactic center  @xcite , nearby massive galaxy clusters are among the most promising targets for indirect dark matter searches by means of gamma rays  @xcite .",
    "a theoretically well motivated example for _ decaying dark matter _ is the gravitino @xmath6 , which appears in locally supersymmetric extensions of the standard model . in scenarios",
    "where @xmath4-parity is mildly violated and the gravitino is the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) , thermal leptogenesis , gravitino dark matter and primordial nucleosynthesis are naturally consistent  @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "the gravitino would decay with cosmological lifetimes  @xcite , making its decay products potentially observable in the cosmic - ray fluxes  @xcite . for gravitino masses",

    "exist in the literature , see refs .",
    "@xcite , and their null results were used to put lower limits on the gravitino lifetime around @xmath9  @xcite . however , for larger gravitino masses @xmath10 , the branching ratio into gamma - ray lines is strongly suppressed , and instead decay modes like @xmath11 and @xmath12 produce a gamma - ray flux with a broad continuous energy spectrum .",
    "it is this flux that could potentially show up in observations of galaxy clusters , whereas the observation of the gamma - ray line in galaxy clusters would be difficult due to the limited statistics .",
    "in general , dark matter lifetimes of the order of @xmath13@xmath14s , which is in the ballpark of what is accessible experimentally , are obtained when the symmetry responsible for the dark matter stability is violated by dimension six operators generated close to the grand unification scale  @xcite .",
    "indeed , models of this kind were proposed to explain the @xmath15 `` excesses '' observed by the pamela  @xcite , fermi  lat  @xcite and h.e.s.s .",

    ", the decay should be mostly leptophilic ( see _ e.g. _  refs .",

    "inside galaxy clusters , due to inverse compton scattering ( ics ) on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , almost all of the kinetic energy of the produced high - energetic electrons and positrons is transferred into gamma rays , with energies up to @xmath19 .",

    "@xcite these results were translated into limits on the dark matter decay rate , and it was demonstrated that galaxy cluster observations give strong constraints on the dark matter lifetime , superior to the limits that could be obtained from satellite galaxy observations , and of the order of the limits that can be derived from the extragalactic gamma - ray background .",
    "this makes galaxy clusters promising targets when searching for signals from dark matter decay .",
    "concerning wimp dark matter , taking into account the expected boost of the annihilation signal due to dark matter substructures in the cluster halo , limits can potentially go down to the cross - section expected from thermal freeze - out  @xcite .",
    "further studies of the galaxy cluster emission as seen by the fermi lat , h.e.s.s . and",

    "@xcite .",

    "proton - proton collision as well as the ics of an energetic electron population can produce a possibly observable gamma - ray flux ( see _ e.g. _  refs .",

    "@xcite the dark matter signal was approximated to be point - source like .",
    "importantly , this approximation becomes problematic in the case of dark matter decay or substructure - boosted annihilation , since the extend of the expected signal starts to exceed the angular resolution of the fermi lat . to account for this",
    ", we model the dark matter emission as an extended source . in absence of a clear signal",
    ", we derive limits on the dark matter lifetime and annihilation cross - section as function of the dark matter mass , for different hadronic and leptonic final states .",
    "cluster masses and the expected decay or annihilation signals are derived from the extended hiflugcs catalog  @xcite which is based on rosat pspc x - ray observations  @xcite , and the corresponding uncertainties are consistently taken into account .",
    "we compare the obtained lifetime limits with the limits that can be derived from the extragalactic gamma - ray background , and we discuss the implications of our limits on the decaying or annihilating dark matter interpretation of the @xmath15 excesses .",
    "furthermore , we will illustrate how the limits improve when a boost of the annihilating signal due to substructures is included .",
    "finally , we apply our findings to the scenario of decaying gravitino dark matter , and derive new constraints on the gravitino lifetime for masses above about @xmath21 .",
    "we comment on implications for the possible observation of long - lived superparticles at the lhc .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present our galaxy cluster analysis of the fermi lat data .",

    "we shortly review how limits on the dark matter lifetime from the extragalactic gamma - ray background are obtained .",
    "our results and their discussion are presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 is devoted to gravitino dark matter , where we present limits on the gravitino lifetime for gravitino masses above @xmath21 , as well as the implied limits on the decay lengths of next - to - lightest superparticles ( nlsp ) at particle colliders .",
