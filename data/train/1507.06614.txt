    "the mathematical modeling of the entire immuno - oncology dynamics is an enormously difficult and complex task . in consequence ,",

    "tumor - induced angiogenesis is a crucial mechanism for cancer survival and proliferation , allowing a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients needed for tumor growth and progression @xcite .",

    "the main feature of our model is the modeling of the interplay between functional tumor - associated vasculature and effector cell dynamics as described in @xcite .",

    "we find that an efficient modulation of the immunostimulating and immunosuppressive phases could induce long - term tumor control .",
    "the present model describes the interactions between growing tumors and induced immune system dynamics .",
    "more precisely , the proposed tumor - effector cell model is a combination of a radial tumor growth model and an effector cell recruitment model originally proposed in @xcite and @xcite respectively , see also @xcite .",
    "the main feature is the low dimensional modeling of the complex interplay between tumor - associated functional vasculature and immune recruitment dynamics as described in @xcite .",
    "this model can be interpreted as the temporal evolution of the average tumor radius , since radially symmetric growth is not a realistic behaviour .",
    "the system variables are the average tumor radius @xmath0 and effector cell concentration @xmath1 in the tumor vicinity .",
    "the temporal evolution of the average tumor radius is considered , where for simplicity invasive and diffusive tumor properties are not taken into account .",
    "the tumor is modeled as an incompressible fluid flowing through a porous medium , where tissue elasticity is simplified .",

    ", we assume that the non - negative and dimensionless parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , represents the net effect of functional tumor - associated vasculature on the tumor radius evolution . in the limit of avascular tumor growth @xmath6 ,",
    "such tumor - effector interactions take place only at the tumor surface . at the other extreme , for @xmath7 effector cells can potentially interact with any cancer cell within the tumor bulk .",
    "moreover , we consider an intrinsic length scale @xmath8 representing the average length of nutrient gradient , i.e. supply , diffusion and consumption .    the efficacy of immune killing depends on the ability of effector cells to penetrate the tumor bulk via the functional tumor - associated blood vessels . with improved vascularization , the effectors kill tumor cells not only on the surface of the tumor , but also further inside @xcite .",

    "this function modulates the term related to tumor - effector cell interactions , such as killing of tumor cells due to effectors represented by a rate @xmath11 .",
    "such scaling functions have been also considered in the classical von bertalanffy approach , and more recently in allometric models @xcite .",
    "taking these factors into account , we deduce the tumor radius @xmath0 dynamic under the assumption of radial symmetry according to the following ode equation :    @xmath12    where the time coordinate @xmath13 has been omitted for notational simplicity , and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath11 are non - negative constants .",

    "effector cells die at a rate @xmath16 , and become inactivated a rate @xmath17 due to their antitumor activity . in particular , the inactivation of effectors by tumor cells is modeled through the function @xmath18 described above .",
    "as functional vascularization increases , effectors can kill cancer cells throughout the tumor bulk and tumor - immune cell interactions increase resulting in more inactivated immune cells .",
    "moreover , innate immunity or base immuno - surveillance is represented as a minimum presence of active effector cells at any time given by an innate immune growth rate @xmath19 , even in the absence of tumor cells .",
    "the resulting ode equation for the effector cell concentration @xmath20 dynamic is given by :    @xmath21    where the time coordinate @xmath13 has been omitted for sake of simplicity in the notation , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 are non - negative constants .      under the small tumor radius assumption ,",
    "the very early tumor growth is always of exponential nature and does not depend on the vascularization effects , i.e. parameter @xmath4 , @xcite .",

    "in this article , we investigate the therapeutic potential of immunomodulatory interventions against tumor growth . to that end",
    ", we consider a model introduced in @xcite that describes the dynamic interplay between vascularized tumor growth and effector cell responses .",
    "our goal is to identify an external modification of effector cell dynamics that allows for controlling tumor growth . with the help of bifurcation analysis",
    ", we identified a unstable oscillatory regime that induces tumor evasion from immuno - surveillance .",
    "the characteristic feature of this regime is the oscillations occur at a faster time scale than the amplitude dynamics . exploiting this time scale separation and via temporal multiscale analysis ,",
    "we map our model onto a weakly negatively damped harmonic oscillator . this approximation allowed us to identify an analytical expression for the additive control term to the effector cell dynamics .",
    "this term acts as an external immunomodulatory therapy where the numerical simulations evidence its efficacy in controlling tumor growth .",
    "the crucial question concerns the translational potential of our theory - driven therapeutic proposal into clinical practice .",
    "our suggested immunomodulatory strategy is relevant to small enough , non - invasive tumors that are initially controlled by the immune system but eventually evade immuno - surveillance .",
    "the latter occurs when tumors exceed a critical size where immune responses are unable to confer any control .",
    "as stated above , our model suggests that such tumor evasion may take place in the form of oscillations of slowly increasing amplitude .",
    "the proposed therapeutic strategy is based on the synchronization of immuno - stimulating and -suppressive phases with tumor growth dynamics .",
    "although immuno - stimulating therapies seem to be expected and plausible @xcite , immuno - suppression sounds counter - intuitive and dangerous .",
    "however , the latter occurs in clinical practice during chemotherapeutic interventions @xcite .",
    "therefore , a potential realization of our proposed strategy could be mediated by a combination of state - of - the - art immunotherapies @xcite and chemotherapeutic modules .",
    "the latter not only will play the role of immuno - suppressor , but also will slow down tumor growth dynamics .",
    "needless to state that such a therapeutic suggestion requires experimental validation and further investigation .    finally , we conclude by pointing out the limitations of the present work .",
    "paramount among them , introducing vascularization dynamics should be not only a natural , but also an insightful extension of the proposed model . at this state tumor vascularization @xmath4",
    "is considered as a constant parameter in time .",
    "thus , making vascularization dynamic would make sense to model further hypoxic effects , such as necrosis or hypoxic - induced invasion .",
    "moreover , the immune system is much more complicated than its description in the current model , involving much more cell types and interactions . in particular ,",
    "immune system is often regarded as acting to suppress tumor growth , however it is now clear that it can be both stimulatory and inhibitory , as in the case of tumor - associated macrophages @xcite . moreover",
    ", our model needs be extended for invasive tumors .",
    "nevertheless , mathematical modeling can help to improve our understanding of the interplay between the several competing factors that have complex implications for cancer therapy .",
    "we hope that the model presented here could provide a step towards this direction .",
