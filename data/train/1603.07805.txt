    "to create a usable memory system , classical or quantum , one must be able to write , store , and read out information reliably .",
    "the main difficulty in this endeavour is the protection of the information written against thermal noise during storage .",
    "therefore , one natural question is the feasibility of self - correcting quantum memory , a device which would correct itself by dissipating energy to the thermal bath  @xcite . instead of requiring active error - correction",
    ", the device would only require initialization of the system in a ground state and a final round of error - correction upon readout .",
    "such a self - correcting quantum memory device could serve as the equivalent hard drive quantum computing technology . here",
    "we define a self - correcting quantum memory as a system with local interactions , non - divergent terms , perturbative stability and diverging quantum memory time at nonzero temperature  @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews .",
    "the mechanism by which self - correction could be implemented is inspired by memory systems in classical physics . in classical memory , such as the two - dimensional ising ferromagnet below a critical temperature , the energy cost associated with the erroneous flip dominates its entropic advantage so that it is likely to flip back and avoid proliferating .",
    "thus a necessary ingredient for self - correcting quantum memory would be that the topologically ordered ground states of a quantum memory system are separated by large energy barriers .",
    "these ideas have inspired several proposals for self - correcting quantum memory  @xcite .",
    "however , at this time , these are not verified or are not fully self - correcting in light of the aforementioned definition .",
    "we refer to these as `` marginally '' self - correcting . additionally , several no - go results are known  @xcite .",
    "namely , it has been shown that systems with both translation and scale invariance can not be self - correcting in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "implementation of codewords as topologically ordered ground states of quantum many - body systems is especially attractive as codewords store logical qubits non - locally with stability against local perturbations .",
    "however , presence of topological order in the ground states is not sufficient for self - correcting behaviors .",
    "for example , the ground states of the two - dimensional toric code are topologically ordered as ground states are locally indistinguishable and can not be prepared from product states via a short - depth circuit . yet ,",
    "due to point - like mobile excitations associated with string - like logical operators , it is not self - correcting  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the four - dimensional toric code , which is provably a self - correcting quantum memory  @xcite , is also topologically ordered above zero temperature in a sense that its gibbs ensemble can not be prepared via a short - depth circuit  @xcite .",
    "this raises another important question concerning whether topological order can survive above zero temperature in three spatial dimensions , or in other words , whether gibbs ensembles of three - dimensional physical systems can be prepared immediately , in light of the definition of thermal topological order proposed by hastings  @xcite .",
    "it is currently not known whether aforementioned proposals of self - correcting quantum memories are topologically ordered at nonzero temperature or not .",
    "the question of topological order at nonzero temperature is expected to be equivalent to that of the feasibility of self - correcting quantum memory .",
    "however , the connection has been established only for simple models such as the two - dimensional and four - dimensional toric code . in this paper , we study static and dynamical properties of marginally self - correcting quantum memory models and further establish the connection between these two notions .",
    "we shall mainly focus on two specific examples , the cubic code and the welded code , but our techniques may extend to a larger class of systems .",
    "our work also serves as a non - trivial test of the definition of thermal topological order proposed by hastings .",
    "* main results : * the cubic code is a three - dimensional stabilizer code with fractal - shaped logical operator and @xmath0 energy barrier .",
    "we begin by proving that the cubic code , which breaks scale invariance , is not topologically ordered above zero temperature .",
    "more precisely , we show that the thermal gibbs ensemble of the cubic code can be approximated from some classical ensemble via an @xmath0-range quantum circuit .",
    "( note that non - constant range is necessary since the approximation error is assessed by trace norm ) .",
    "further , this result extends to a larger class of quantum codes with fractal shaped logical operators .",
    "although the result itself is perhaps not surprising , as evidences of thermal instability of the cubic code have been known , what may be new is the proof technique and also the physical intuition therein .",
    "first , we introduce the concept of an imperfect hamiltonian @xmath1 where interaction terms are removed from a stabilizer hamiltonian @xmath2 with some probability @xmath3 which is set by the temperature : @xmath4 .",
    "we then show that , if there ( almost surely ) exists a short - depth quantum circuit to disentangle @xmath1 , then the system is not topologically ordered at a given temperature .",
    "second , we observe that the missing terms in an imperfect hamiltonian @xmath1 act as sinks for excitations so that by moving excitations to locations of missing terms , they can be eliminated from the system .",
    "this observation allows one to identify the gibbs ensemble approximation problem as evaluations of free energies , enabling us to employ the peierls argument to heuristically assess the absence and the presence of topological order at nonzero temperature . finally , we prove that isolated excitations in the cubic code can be eliminated by moving them to nearby sinks .",
    "the proof utilizes polynomial representations of translation invariant stabilizer hamiltonians in a crucial manner .",
    "next , we turn our attention to the welded code which is free from string - like logical operators , has @xmath5 energy barrier and breaks translation invariance .",
    "we show that quantum memory time of the welded code is upper bounded by @xmath6 for a fixed temperature .",
    "namely , we show that quantum memory time of the welded code is upper bounded by classical memory time of the ising model supported on a sparse lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sparse - lattice ] ) .",
    "we then argue that memory time can be computed from the peierls argument .",
    "our derivation of memory time is not mathematically rigorous , and we back up our analytical result by numerical simulations of memory time of the sparse ising model and confirm doubly exponential behavior .    again , although the result itself is perhaps not surprising , as relations between the one - dimensional ising model and the two - dimensional toric code have been noticed , what may be new is the proof technique and also the physical intuition therein .",
    "the key idea is to choose a minimal set of davies generators that ensure ergodicity in the weak - coupling limit since the gap of the lindblad operator ( in other words , the inverse of memory time ) is lower bounded by that of a minimal choice .",
    "thermal dynamics under minimal generators can be effectively described by a simpler classical system which enables a formal reduction to a classical problem .",
    "we will provide an algorithm to find such minimal generators which applies to arbitrary css stabilizer codes .",
    "this generalizes the work by alicki _",
    "et al _ on davies generators for the two - dimensional toric code to arbitrary css stabilizer codes  @xcite .",
    "applications of this algorithm to the welded code enable reduction to problems concerning the ising model on a sparse graph .",
    "we also reveal that the procedure of the welding has an interesting interpretation as attaching several copies of topological codes along the same gapped boundary .",
    "* plan of the paper : * the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : topo ] , we develop key theoretical tools to study topological order at nonzero temperature . in section  [ sec : cube ] , we prove that the cubic code is not topologically ordered at nonzero temperature . in section",
