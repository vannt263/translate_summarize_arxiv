    "this paper is devoted to describing atmospheric trapped modes extending to large heights .",
    "a description of these modes at higher altitudes , above all , is extremely important in terms of their experimental identification .",
    "the energy of the waveguide modes is mainly concentrated in low heights , into their trapping region . however ,",
    "if the disturbance amplitude at these heights is very small compared with the background atmospheric parameters , then we have a possibility of indirect observation the disturbance in the upper atmosphere only , where , due to an increase of relative disturbance amplitude because of the atmospheric density drop , it can lead to significant changes in the charged component of the ionosphere .",
    "it is because of the `` invisible '' igw propagation in the lower atmosphere we can observe such a phenomenon as the traveling ionospheric disturbances ( tid ) , @xcite .",
    "the problem of describing the atmospheric trapped modes can be solved , using a dissipative solution above source ( dsas ) @xcite .",
    "actually , any dsas satisfies the upper boundary condition for trapped modes , that is , the absence of the flow of energy towards the earth in the upper layers of the atmosphere , and , because there is no source , is applicable up to the earth .",
    "therefore , the problem of trapped mode finding reduces to the problem of selection of a dsas that satisfies the lower boundary condition for trapped modes - the zero displacement on the earth s surface .",
    "thus , the condition of the equality to the zero of vertical velocity for dsas on the earth s surface is the dispersion equation for trapped mode",
    ". this dispersion equation can be regarded as an equation for a horizontal wavenumber at known frequency or vice versa .",
    "we consider igw waveguide modes , which exist due to the temperature inhomogeneity of the lower atmosphere , and lamb modes .",
    "given a real frequency , we find the complex horizontal wavenumber .",
    "the complexity of horizontal wavenumbers is a consequence of dissipation and presence of subbarrier leakage from the igw waveguide .",
    "the horizontal wavenumber found , we can obtain a vertical structure of the mode , which gives relationships of the disturbance parameters in the lower atmosphere with its parameters in the upper isothermal atmosphere .",
    "we organize our paper as follows . a model of the atmosphere applied for calculations",
    "is described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to construction and analysis of waveguide modes of the igw spectral range .",
    "we compare the solutions of the waveguide problem , constructed from a dsas , to solutions obtained in the frames of the dissipationless approximation by both the wkb method and numerical ones .",
    "such comparisons aim at two things at once .",
    "first , they allow us to reach clarity in understanding of dissipation effect on the main characteristics of the waveguide propagation : the dispersion relations , the waveguide leakage , and the horizontal attenuation of the waveguide modes .",
    "second , they serve as additional tests to the tests of @xcite , of both method for dsas and corresponding codes .",
    "we obtain dispersive properties and a description of a height structure of all disturbance parameters .",
    "all special features of trapped igws are present in the obtained waveguide solution in the real atmosphere : localization due to the temperature stratification ; the leakage through the opacity area ; qualitative changes of the wave structure related to dissipative nature of the disturbances in the upper atmosphere .",
    "we obtain complete information on all the height structure of waveguide modes , which can be directly used to reveal a quantitative compliance of igw modes with tids .",
    "we show that the properties of the obtained waveguide solutions are in good agreement with the main characteristics of tids following from their observations : the periods to space scales ratios , the weak horizontal attenuation , the values of full phase velocity ; the inclinations of the phase fronts .",
    "it should be noted that the waveguide modes were investigated in @xcite and their results are widely used both in theoretical works and in the interpretation of observations of various disturbances , including those in the upper atmosphere @xcite in papers @xcite , the dispersion characteristics and vertical structures of the waveguide modes were obtained . in @xcite , it was shown that one or two lower igw modes are able present , due to the waveguide leakage , at ionospheric heights .",
    "method of francis allows to calculate well enough the structure of wave disturbances in the lower part of the atmosphere and the dispersion characteristics of the modes captured by the temperature inhomogeneity of the lower atmosphere . in details ,",
    "method of francis is discussed in terms of its applicability in the upper atmosphere in @xcite . here",
    "we note only the fact that the specificity of the method of francis to use everywhere reduction of order of the differential equations , allowable only in the weak dissipation case , really do not give a possibility to obtain a correct description of disturbances in the upper atmosphere .",
    "in contrast to the method of francis , in our method of constructing of drni , we use reduction of order of the wave equation to the second ( in our own way ) for the small dissipation altitudes only , where it is justified . by virtue of this , our method , unlike the method of francis , allows to describe disturbances of the upper atmosphere adequately .    the calculations for the lamb waves , analogous to those for the igw waveguide modes , are presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is a conclusion .",

    "it is important that the obtained dispersion dependence fairly faithfully reproduces the observed ratio of horizontal scales to periods of tids and gives reasonable estimates for their full phase velocities obtainable in measurements @xcite these results are quite consistent with the concept of the waveguide nature of the tids .",
