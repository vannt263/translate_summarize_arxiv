    "topological effects on statistical and dynamical properties of ring polymers should be quite nontrivial .",
    "the topological state of a ring polymer is described by a knot type , and it is invariant after its synthesis .",
    "knotted ring polymers or knotted dnas have been discussed theoretically since the 1960s @xcite , and recently they are synthesized in several experiments @xcite .",
    "various topological effects on ring polymers have been explicitly studied through numerical simulations of random polygons under topological constraints @xcite . however",
    ", many questions still remain unsolved even on the average size of a knotted ring polymer in solution , which should be the most fundamental quantity in the physics of ring polymers .",
    "recently , it has been suggested @xcite that the average size @xmath9 of a random polygon with the trivial knot should scale as @xmath10 with respect to the number @xmath2 of polygonal nodes , where the exponent @xmath11 is given by the exponent @xmath12 of the asymptotic scaling - behavior of the the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) where @xmath13 . here",
    "we remark that random polygons correspond to ring polymers with no excluded volume .",
    "there has also been a conjecture @xcite that the effect of topology on the average size of ring polymers could play a similar role as the excluded - volume effect , since the topological constraint should effectively lead to an entropic repulsion among the monomer segments . here",
    ", we note that the trivial knot ( or the unknot ) is such a knot that is equivalent to an unknotted circle",
    ".    the conjecture on the entropic repulsion seems to be quite interesting , and the anomalous scaling behavior with an enhanced exponent should be effective at least for some numerical simulations .",
    "however , it is not trivial to understand the consequence that the scaling exponent should be enhanced and given by that of saw .",
    "first of all , under no topological constraint , the average size @xmath14 of a random polygon scales as @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear whether the scaling exponents of nontrivial knots should be enhanced similarly as that of the trivial knot .",
    "if they might have the same exponent of saw , then why the total average over all knot types can have the exponent @xmath17 of random walk ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss these questions explicitly through numerical simulations .",
    "we evaluate the mean square radius of gyration @xmath18 of gaussian random polygons with a fixed knot type @xmath1 . discussing the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath19 for several different knot types ,",
    "we show that the anomalous scaling behavior should be considered as a strong finite - size effect which could be valid for very large values of @xmath2 such as 2000 .",
    "we now review some relevant results on the topological effects of ring polymers .",
    "let us take a model of random polygons of @xmath2 nodes @xcite , which describes ring polymers consisting of @xmath2 kuhn units at the theta condition .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 the probability of a given configuration of the random polygon of @xmath2 nodes having a fixed knot type @xmath1 . for the trivial knot",
    ", it was numerically shown @xcite that the probability is given by an exponential function of @xmath2 : @xmath21 .",
    "for nontrivial knots , the probability is well described by the following function of @xmath2 : @xmath22 , where we call @xmath7 and @xmath23 the characteristic length of random knotting and the topological exponent of the knot , respectively @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath7 is model - dependent , and is roughly given by 340 for the gaussian random polygon @xcite .",
    "we remark that the number @xmath7 is important in the analysis of topological effects with the blob picture @xcite .",
    "the mean - squared gyration radius @xmath19 under the topological constraint of knot @xmath1 has been discussed for some models of self - avoiding polygons ( saps ) in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the lattice model",
    ", it is shown that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath19 is consistent with that of the rg theory where in the large @xmath2 limit the ratio @xmath24 comes close to 1.0 for any knot . however , for the cylinder model of saps @xcite , it is found @xcite that the limit of the ratio depends on the cylinder radius which controls the excluded - volume . for a lattice model of random polygons",
    "@xcite , @xmath19 has been evaluated for the trivial and trefoil knots with small polygons of @xmath25 .",
    "we now introduce the gaussian random polygon @xcite .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the position vectors of the nodes of a configuration of the gaussian random polygon of @xmath2 segments , and @xmath27 the jump vectors such that @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "then , the gaussian random polygon has the following distribution function of the jump vectors : @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 denote dirac s delta function in three dimensions .",
    "we construct @xmath32 configurations of the gaussian random polygon with @xmath2 nodes by the conditional probability distribution @xcite @xmath33    let us consider @xmath32 samples of randomly constructed polygons with @xmath2 nodes .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the number of polygons with knot @xmath1 .",
    "we determine the number @xmath34 by enumerating such polygons in the set of @xmath32 polygons that have the same set of values of the following two invariants for knot @xmath1 : the determinant of knot @xmath35 and the vassiliev invariant @xmath36 of the second degree @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the numerical data of our simulations . for gaussian random polygons with several different numbers @xmath2 up to 1900 , numerical estimates of @xmath37 and @xmath19",
    "have been obtained for the four knots : the trivial , trefoil ( @xmath38 ) and figure - eight ( @xmath39 ) knots , and the composite knot consisting of two trefoil knots ( @xmath40 ) . here , we take @xmath41 in all the simulations .",
    "we recall that under no topological constraint , the mean square radius of gyration @xmath37 of a random polygon with @xmath2 nodes is defined by @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is the position vector of the @xmath44-th node and the symbol @xmath45 denotes the statistical average , which is given by the average over @xmath32 polygons in the simulations . for a knot @xmath1 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath19 is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 denotes the gyration radius of the @xmath48-th gaussian random polygon that has the knot type @xmath1 , in the set of @xmath32 polygons . in terms of @xmath19 , @xmath37 is given by @xmath49 .    in fig .",
    "1 , the graphs of the ratio @xmath50 against the the number @xmath2 are depicted for the trivial , trefoil and figure - eight knots . the fitting curves in fig .",
    "1 are given by @xmath51 .",
    "the best estimates of the fitting parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "1 that the ratio @xmath50 is not constant with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "the ratio @xmath50 increases monotonically for all the knots . for the trivial knot ,",
    "the ratio @xmath52 is always larger than 1.0 . on the other hand , for the other three knots (",
    "@xmath1=@xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , the ratio @xmath50 is smaller than 1.0 when @xmath2 is small .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath50 becomes larger than 1.0 when @xmath2 is large .",
    "thus , the topological constraint gives an effective swelling for the case of large @xmath2 .",
    "here we have a conjecture that for any nontrivial knot @xmath1 , @xmath19 should be larger than @xmath37 if @xmath2 is large enough .",
    "let us consider the plot of the trivial knot shown in fig .",
    "1 . there is a nontrivial finite - size behavior : the ratio @xmath52 is constant wit respect to @xmath2 when @xmath2 is very small , while when @xmath53 , it can be approximated by a scaling behavior as @xmath54 , at least up to @xmath55 .",
    "this crossover phenomenon should be consistent with the recent theory given by grosberg @xcite .",
    "however , the effective exponent @xmath56 is much smaller than the exponent @xmath12 with respect to the errors .",
    "in fact , we have the numerical estimate : @xmath57 .    for the case of nontrivial knots ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) ,",
    "the ratio @xmath50 is well approximated by the power law : @xmath58 for the range from @xmath59 to @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , there is no crossover for the nontrivial knots : we do not find any change in the slope of the graphs near @xmath60 .",
    "it is also remarkable from table 1 that the exponent @xmath61 strongly depends on the knot type .",
    "in particular , the effective scaling exponent of the composite knot @xmath62 is almost as large as the exponent @xmath12 , while that of the trefoil knot is given by 0.561 , which is rather smaller than @xmath12 with respect to the errors .",
    "let us consider the three fitting lines of fig .",
    ", we see that the three lines become very close to each other at around @xmath55 . furthermore , it is suggested from the simulations that when @xmath2 becomes close to 2000 , the values of @xmath19 for the four knots ( @xmath1=trivial , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath63 ) should become almost equal to each other .",
    "in fact , up to @xmath64 , the values of @xmath19 for the nontrivial knots are always smaller than or equal to that of @xmath65 in our simulations . if the power - law approximation might be valid also for @xmath66 , then @xmath65 would become much smaller than @xmath67 of the three nontrivial knots for large @xmath2 and it would be inconsistent with the numerical results obtained so far .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the approximation of @xmath19 with the power law should be valid only when @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , in order to study the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath19 for @xmath66 , we need another independent analysis .",
    "let us discuss the asymptotic behavior of @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath2 is very large , we may assume the following expansion : @xmath68 .",
    "it is consistent with renormalization group arguments , and hence it should be valid when @xmath2 is asymptotically large . for the ratio @xmath50 we have the following expansion : @xmath69 where @xmath70 . here",
    "we recall that @xmath16 . for each of the four knots ,",
    "we have applied the formula ( [ asympto ] ) to the 10 data points with @xmath71 shown in fig . 1 . here , when we assign the condition of @xmath71 , we have taken into account the strong finite - size effects of @xmath67 such as the crossover of the trivial knot .",
    "another recent study @xcite on the cylinder model of saps @xcite shows that the asymptotic scaling behavior is seen only when @xmath72 for the case of very thin cylinders with the cylinder radius @xmath73 .",
    "the best estimates of the fitting parameters of the formula ( [ asympto ] ) and the @xmath74 values are listed in table 2 . from the results",
    ", we may conclude that the asymptotic expansion ( [ asympto ] ) is consistent with the numerical values of @xmath75 for @xmath71 .",
    "it is remarked that the @xmath74 values in table 2 are less than 10 for the four knots .",
    "moreover , the best estimates are compatible with several different viewpoints .",
    "for instance , the estimate of @xmath76 is given by about 0.03 and independent of the knot type .",
    "this leads to an estimate of the exponent : @xmath77 .",
    "the value can be considered as equivalent to the exponent @xmath17 , with respect to the errors of the analysis .",
    "the fact that the exponent @xmath78 is independent of the knot type is consistent with the interpretation on the lattice model of refs . @xcite .",
    "the estimated values of the amplitude ratio @xmath79 for the four knots also seem to be independent of the knot type .",
    "we note that we have assumed @xmath80=0.5 in constructing table 2 .",
    "when we set @xmath80=1.0 , similar values are obtained for the best estimates of the fitting parameters .",
    "let us consider a formula which effectively describes the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath19 for @xmath66 .",
    "assuming @xmath81 in the asymptotic formula ( [ asympto ] ) , we have the following : @xmath82 . here",
    "we have replaced by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath79 and @xmath85 , respectively . applying the formula to the numerical data of @xmath19 of the gaussian random polygon for @xmath71",
    ", we see that it gives good fitting curves to the data .",
    "the best estimates of the parameters are shown in table 3 .",
    "interestingly , they are rather close to the best estimates for the cylinder model of saps with a very small cylinder radius , which are obtained by applying the same formula to the data of @xmath19 in ref . @xcite . in table 3 , the parameter @xmath83 is roughly given by 1.5 for the gaussian random polygon .",
    "on the other hand , we have the similar value for the cylinder model with the cylinder radius @xmath86 as shown in fig . 3 of ref .",
    "we also find in table 3 that @xmath87 for the four knots .",
    "it follows that the mean size @xmath88 of random polygons with a specified knot @xmath1 , such as the trivial , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath62 knots , is larger than the average size @xmath14 of random polygons over all knots in the asymptotic regime .",
    "however , it is consistent with the observation in fig .",
    "1 that the ratio @xmath50 increases monotonically and approaches 1.3 or 1.4 when @xmath89 ( see also ref .",
    "we have shown that @xmath19 of gaussian random polygons have strong finite - size effects which should be valid for extremely large values of @xmath2 such as @xmath55 .",
    "if we remove the finite - size effects from the data analysis , then the asymptotic behavior of @xmath19 is given by the standard one with the critical exponent @xmath17 of random walks .",
    "here we note that the main result should be valid also for the numerical data of other models of random polygons @xcite .",
    "thus , the studies @xcite associated with the conjecture of the effective entropic - repulsion should be important for describing the strong finite - size effects of random polygons , which could appear practically in any system of ring polymers in solution at the theta condition .",
