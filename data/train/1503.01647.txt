    "the paper discusses the decentralized recommender systems , which is in contrast to the typical recommender systems built on centralized infrastructures ( the `` cloud '' , etc . ) .",
    "the decentralized network @xcite had been thoroughly investigated in control and communication fields , defined as a set of distributed but connected agents , who are generally not strongly connected in a graph theoretic sense .",
    "each agent collects data by itself , and executes computation via limited communication within only local neighborhoods .",
    "1 shows a comparison of centralized versus decentralized network structures .",
    "specifically , in a decentralized recommender system , individual users / user - groups can be viewed as network agents .",
    "each user holds his or her own ratings as partially observed data .",
    "the data can not be accessed by any intermediate point or centralized server in the network .",
    "therefore , it has a potential effect on protecting user data privacy against both the cloud server and some malicious eavesdropping over uploading channels . for a large - scale network of mobile users ,",
    "the decentralized models own a better scalability since users are only locally connected .",
    "since data storages and computations are fully distributed , the decentralized systems also become robust to center ( cloud ) or individual agent ( user ) failures .    to our best knowledge ,",
    "we are the first studying and designing a decentralized recommender system .",
    "there have been some recent interests in investigating algorithms in a decentralized fashion @xcite , and moreover , preliminary literatures to reveal the convergence @xcite and dynamics @xcite properties .",
    "all above make it solid and promising to build application scenes on a decentralized network structure .",
    "as a most popular tool in recommender system , collaborative filtering ( cf ) is usually formulated as matrix factorizations problem  @xcite @xcite . it predicts user rating @xmath0 ( of @xmath1-th user on @xmath2-th item ) as a dot product of the user profile of the @xmath1-th user , denoted as a row vector @xmath3 , and the item profile of the j - th item denoted as a column vector @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "the recommendation problem can be formulated as solving the following matrix factorization problem : @xmath6 here @xmath7 denotes the projection over the set of available ratings , and @xmath8 is an auxiliary matrix .",
    "@xmath9 , ( @xmath1 = @xmath10 ) ; initializations of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 for each @xmath1-th user ( @xmath1 = @xmath10 ) ; step size @xmath14 ; iter    for t=1 to iter do    each @xmath1-th user updates @xmath12 : @xmath15    each @xmath1-th user updates @xmath13 : @xmath16    each @xmath1-th user propagates @xmath11 to its one - hop neighborhood @xmath17 .",
    "each @xmath1-th user updates @xmath11 : + @xmath18 + @xmath19    end    @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , @xmath1 = @xmath10    it is assumed that cf is performed by @xmath20 users jointly in a decentralized manner , and @xmath21 is segmented into @xmath20 non - overlapped parts , denoted as @xmath22 , @xmath1 = @xmath10 .",
    "for example , the easiest case to segment @xmath21 is to divide by columns .",
    "the @xmath1-th user ( @xmath1 = @xmath10 ) observes @xmath22 . note some level of synchronization is still required to collaboratively utilize information from all users .",
    "the trade - off strategy is * to share partial data only among users in the local neighborhood*. after observing the problem structure , authors in @xcite suggested an variant of nonlinear gauss - seidel ( gs ) iterations , named _ decentralized matrix completion _ ( * dmc * ) algorithm .",
    "the @xmath1-th user will hold @xmath22 , as well as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 based on its own computations . note",
    "@xmath11 here is of the same size as @xmath23 , and @xmath13 of the same dimension as @xmath22 , so in other words , @xmath24 . in each iteration ,",
    "the @xmath1-th user first updates @xmath12 and @xmath13 independently , then exchanging @xmath11 with its one - hop connected neighborhood users , and finally update @xmath11 via the average consensus algorithm@xcite .",
    "the algorithm is summarized in algorithm i. it obtains similar reconstruction errors , compared to centralized solutions @xcite .",
    "we compare our proposed algorithm with state - of - the - arts in this section , including probabilistic matrix factorization ( _ pmf _ ) @xcite , and collaborative topic modeling ( _ ctr _ ) @xcite , on a collected image recommendation dataset from flickr .",
    "* flickruserfavor dataset * : the dataset contains @xmath25 images collected from flickr , from 140 user groups and uploaded by 20,298 users .",
    "we use the _ `` like '' _ feedback provided by users as binary ratings .",
    "@xmath26 of the rating matrix is used as training , and @xmath27 as testing .",
    "* evaluation measurement * : we use the averaged ranked order of all the rated images in the testing dataset for a specific user to evaluate performances . among these ranked images ,",
    "we determine those for which a user has exhibited a _ `` like '' _ preference in the _ test data _ , and report the _ average percentile score _ ( aps ) of the ranked images which are indeed preferred by the user .",
    "the lower the aps , the better the algorithm is , which means the user preferred images are ranked in top positions .",
    "finally , the _ maps _ is reported with the mean of the aps scores for all target users .",
    "* performance comparision * : pmf @xcite is the most classical collaborative filtering algorithm for recommender system .",
    "wang et.al .",
    "also proposed the collaborative topic model @xcite which involves both content and user ratings , where we use the hierarchical gaussianization ( hg ) @xcite as the image features .",
    "for the proposed decentralized algorithm , we set the rank as 64 , and using 8 agents . detailed _ maps _ comparisons are shown in table  [ tab : performance ] .",
    "it is shown that dmc is capable to achieve competitive performance as _ ctr _ , while is far better than _",
    "pmf_. moreover , we do not use any content information in our algorithm , while _ ctr _ uses content to indicates similarities between items .",
    "that suggests a further direction improve our algorithm too .",

    "this paper discusses a decentralized recommender system . we formulate the popular collaborative filleting model into a decentralized matrix completion problem .",
    "each user , with only partial rating data , can exchange user profile factors with its local neighborhood , while keep item profile factors private .",
