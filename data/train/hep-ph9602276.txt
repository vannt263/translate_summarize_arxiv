    "the literature on the perturbative treatment of the quark - antiquark potential is very abundant .",
    "but even for the bottom quark these calculations suffer from the drawback that non - perturbative contributions can be estimated to be as large as the leading coulomb part , and thus that their perturbative inclusion is not justified . on the other hand ,",
    "phenomenological potentials with a large number of free parameters are used extensively @xcite .",
    "the situation is completely different for the top quark . with its mass of @xmath3 gev",
    "it is heavy enough to allow a completely perturbative treatment .",
    "the drawback of this heavy mass is that , owing to its weak decay , individual bound state levels are not directly observable .",
    "however , this turns into a virtue since this large decay width effectively cuts off non - perturbative contributions in the calculation of the cross sections near threshold @xcite . for computations in this region",
    "the input of a perturbative qcd potential is justified and it is thus desirable to investigate to which extent we are able to calculate such a potential . unfortunately , despite the large amount of literature , the number of studies including reliable qcd perturbative calculations beyond the lowest orders is actually small .",
    "for example in most cases higher order corrections are derived from on shell scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this is not a consistent approach since different powers give contributions to the same order in the energy shift of bound states .",
    "the present article is also intended to shed some light on the calculation of spin - dependent forces up to @xmath4 where perturbation theory is likely to be applicable even for lighter quarks .",
    "recently a consistent treatment on the basis of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation was given @xcite where the level shifts themselves have been used as ordering parameter .",
    "there it was emphasized that it would be incorrect to extrapolate from the absence of corrections to @xmath5 other than the tree graphs in the qed case to qcd because gluon splitting allows new types of graphs .",
    "therefore we will discuss here possible sources of new corrections to that particular @xmath5 in some detail .",
    "the two - loop box graphs on which we concentrate in this letter are represented in fig .",
    "[ dfig5 ] .",
    "as we adopt the coulomb gauge , the full gluon propagator ( graphically represented by a wavy line ) can be split , as usual , into a coulomb part ( broken line ) and a transverse part ( curly line ) .",

    "[ dfig5 ] , may be checked to give higher - order corrections .    in @xcite",
    "an exact zeroth - order solution has been derived for the toponium bs equation , generalizing the barbieri - remiddi equation @xcite to the case of unstable particles . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to consider the corresponding zeroth - order wave functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 in a non - relativistic approximation : ( p)^nr & = & _ nlm ( ) s = -_0 |(p)^nr _ 0 , [ xapp ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the bohr levels , @xmath10 , @xmath11 the schrdinger - coulomb wave functions , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are written as spinor matrices with @xmath12 a @xmath13 matrix representing the spin state of the particle - antiparticle system : s & = & \\ {    l@:l _ 5 ^- & + * a*_m * * ^- & ( m=0,1 _ m^2 = 1 )    .",

    "[ spin ] all the following contributions are evaluated between @xmath12 and @xmath14 ( times a normalization factor @xmath15 ) .",
    "first we will consider the qcd box graph of fig .",
    "[ dfig5]a .",
    "let @xmath16 , @xmath17 , be the incoming and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , the outgoing momenta of the particle and antiparticle .",
    "we define the total momentum @xmath20 , the relative momentum of the incoming particles @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "our present correction is put between bs wave functions , in agreement with the general approach of bs perturbation theory . in that formalism , after performing the colour and spinor indices traces , the perturbation kernel of graph [ dfig5]a can be written as -i h_[dfig5].a & = & 12 ig^6 d^4t(2)^4d^4k(2)^4 + & & q(-,,- ) , [ hgraph ] with q ( , , ) : = - . in the centre - of - mass frame @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the integrations over @xmath26 and @xmath27 are quite simple , but the complicate angular structure seems to be a serious obstacle to the exact evaluation of the remaining integral . observing that for the bound state the scales of the momenta are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , it is natural to introduce rescalings as follows : p_0 & & ^2 p_0 , + & & , + & & , [ scaling ] + & & , + & & .as a consequence , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hgraph ] ) is easily seen to retain a single power of @xmath30 times an integral which is finite in the limit @xmath31 , remembering that the centre - of - mass energy is @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the leading contribution in @xmath30 of ( [ hgraph ] ) is simply obtained by putting @xmath33 in this integral .",
    "the resulting expression is h_[dfig5].a & = & 162 ^3 d^3t(2)^3 d^3k(2)^3 q(-,,- ) [ hgraph2 ] which only depends on @xmath34 .",
    "the trick to simplify this expression is to write the inner products in terms of quadratic expressions that partly cancel the denominators : q(- , , - ) & = & .",
    "[ trick ] while the original integral ( [ hgraph2 ] ) is finite , the integrals one obtains from a single summand in ( [ trick ] ) are not , so the evaluation of them requires some care . in the appendix",
    "we give the list of integrals necessary to evaluate ( [ hgraph2 ] ) .",
    "the divergent integrals have been regularized with a cut - off in the integration region , but , as a check , we have verified that the same result can be obtained within dimensional regularization .",
    "removing the auxiliary regulators , obviously all divergent terms cancel in the final expression , which can be written as h_[dfig5].a = -(12- ^2 ) , [ h5a ] where we have restored the initial definition of @xmath34 ( before scaling ) . taking into account the factor @xmath35 from the wave functions , we find , as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ h5a ] ) , that the graph [ dfig5]a indeed yields contributions of @xmath1 to the energy levels .",
    "therefore it must be included in an @xmath1 evaluation of the qcd potential @xmath36 .",

    "in fact the insertion of a transverse gluon propagator between the wave function and the free quark propagator @xmath12 annihilates its leading contribution .",
    "but additional powers in the spatial momenta and consequently ( see ( [ scaling ] ) ) in powers of @xmath37 remain : s ( + p ) & & i p_0 + p_0/2 - e_p + i ( ^ - 2 e_p +  ) +  , [ sf ] + ^ _ j s ( + p ) & & ^ _ j i p_0 + p_0/2 - e_p + i ( - 2 e_p ) +  , with @xmath38 . however , we note that this graph contributes to the spin - dependent part of the interaction .",

    "graphs like fig .",
    "[ dfig5]a and [ dfig5]b with crossed coulomb lines ( fig . [ dfig5]d ) are irrelevant because they vanish due to group theoretical factors .    by connecting the quark lines between the interactions in the non - abelian vertex correction graph and graph [ dfig5]a , as shown in fig .",

    "( [ iiigraph ] ) after scaling .",
    "since it can be shown that the leading contribution of the derivative of @xmath48 with respect to @xmath30 is proportional to @xmath49 ( scaling @xmath40 a second time and putting @xmath50 in the integral ) , the leading contribution of @xmath47 is h^(1)_[dfig5a].a = c_[dfig5a].a^2 .",

    "thus a short remark on the coupling constant to be used seems in order .",
    "it is customary to take the strong coupling constant @xmath60 in the @xmath59 scheme . in particular experimental determinations",

    "clearly it should be possible to relate the two schemes .",
    "the quark - antiquark potential in the @xmath59 scheme with only light quarks to @xmath62 in the self - energy function of the coulomb gluon can be taken for instance from @xcite .",

    "we can thus write for the potential in momentum space _ = - .",
    "comparison with the potential @xmath36 gives ^bs= _ , [ alrel ] where bs denotes our bound - state scheme .",
    "it should be emphasized that we have explicitly included the dependence on massive flavours in this formula .",
    "numerically , eq . ( [ alrel ] )",
    "means that our @xmath37 is slightly smaller than the usual one , which is advantageous for our perturbative calculation . for @xmath63 gev , @xmath64",

    "remember that the above values for @xmath67 differ by a factor of @xmath68 from @xmath60 .    for the comparison of the two schemes , the terms of the form",
    "@xmath69 have been important . to compare to relative @xmath70 ,",
