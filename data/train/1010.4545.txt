    "<S> strong candidates for experiments are the two magnetically trappable clock states in @xmath0rb  @xcite , in part because they experience equal trapping potentials and have nearly spin - independent interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the drawback is that no convenient feshbach resonances are available for these states , preventing precise control of the three relevant ( inter and intra - state ) interaction strengths .    in the two - component ( `` spin-1/2 '' ) 1d bose gas , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of spin - independent ( symmetric ) interactions is of particular interest . for all interaction strengths ( weak and strong ) the dispersion relation of spin waves is quadratic here  @xcite , and the low - energy spin velocity vanishes . as a consequence the usual luttinger - liquid description  @xcite </S>",

    "<S> we show that radio - frequency - dressed potentials on atom chips offer a new way to tune the effective interactions in 1d and to control spin motion . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of the fact that , for elliptical rf polarizations , different hyperfine states experience different dressed potentials , allowing for state - dependent manipulation  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the dependence of the 1d coupling strength on the transverse confinement frequency @xmath1  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> differences between experiment and simulation can be explained by the limited optical resolution of our imaging system and a small tilt of the trap , leading to a slight spatial asymmetry in the experiments . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we first discuss our results on the one - dimensional non - equilibrium dynamics for state-_in_dependent potentials , highlighting the importance of small differences in interaction parameters . </S>",

    "<S> the spin dynamics can be interpreted as a `` focusing '' of state @xmath9 in the presence of state @xmath7 , resulting in a negative spin polarization ( @xmath10 ) toward the center of the trap .    we find good agreement with the experimental data using the coupled 1d gross - pitaevskii equations ( 1d - gpe ) with solutions also shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the 1d - gpe is obtained by integrating the full 3d - gpe over the transverse ground - state wavefunctions  @xcite , with interaction parameters derived from the intra- and interstate scattering lengths taken from ref .  </S>",

    "<S> . similarly we use values for the scaled rate constants for inelastic two - body and three - body losses derived from the 3d values in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 1d - gpe simulations reproduce the features of the experiment , i.e. absence of dynamics in the total density and the overall structure of the spin dynamics including the time of maximum state separation around @xmath19ms . </S>",
    "<S> the decay in atom number on a @xmath20  ms timescale is dominated by two - body losses in intrastate interactions and between @xmath9 atoms ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the rate of spin focusing / defocusing is critically dependent on the precise differences in 1d interaction strengths for the respective internal states , a fact that is readily confirmed by changing these differences in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the observed general behavior can be understood as follows : in the initial state ( an interacting trapped quantum gas in a single internal state in equilibrium ) the repulsive interactions balance the external confining potential . suddenly transferring a fraction of the population to a second internal state with weaker intra- and interstate interactions results in a net contracting force ( a confining effective curvature , @xmath23 in equations   below ) on the population in this second state that dominates the dynamics in the spin polarization . because the spin - dependent part of the interactions is relatively small , the dynamics in the _ total _ density </S>",
    "<S> are dominated by the ( relatively large ) average scattering length which remains nearly constant . </S>",
    "<S> hence the total density shows only weak dynamics ; the focusing in @xmath4 is accommodated by `` pushing '' @xmath5 to the sides ( red in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : data&gp ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now describe the state - dependent radio - frequency - dressed potentials that we use to control the spin motion . </S>",
    "<S> we consider near - resonant coupling ( @xmath24 ) of the rf field with tuneable polarization determined by the relative phase of two independently controlled rf - fields . </S>",
    "<S> a cross section of the wire geometry used is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : trapbottom](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fields originate from direct digital synthesis ( dds ) supplied currents in two wires neighboring the z - shaped trapping wire  @xcite . with these two fields </S>",
    "<S> we can readily control the ellipticity of the total rf field at the trap position by controlling the relative phase @xmath25 of the rf currents in the two wires . </S>",
    "<S> this includes linear ( horizontal and vertical ) and circular ( @xmath26 ) polarizations .    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding dressed - state potential for state @xmath18 ( with @xmath27 ) has the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bare magnetic ( harmonic ) potential . </S>",
    "<S> the state - dependent part of the potential enters through the coupling rabi frequency @xmath30  @xcite , which acts to weaken the overall confinement near the trap bottom by an amount given by the dressing parameter @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> taking the second derivative of the potential @xmath32 around the origin yields new trap frequencies , @xmath33 with detuning @xmath34 and larmor frequency @xmath35 .        </S>",
    "<S> the state - dependent rf potential is characterized using dressed - state rf spectroscopy with a weak additional rf probe  @xcite . figure  [ fig : trapbottom](b ) shows the measured trap bottom as a function of the dressing phase @xmath25 , for @xmath36  mhz . for @xmath37 and @xmath38 the potential is maximally state - dependent , corresponding to the pure circular polarizations @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively ( dressing only state @xmath7 and only state @xmath9 , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the potentials are state - independent for linear polarization at @xmath41 ( equal dressing of state @xmath7 and @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation from a simple @xmath42 behavior is due to the wire geometry , as the two rf fields are not quite orthogonal at the trap position . </S>",
    "<S> a fit to the data ( solid and dashed curves ) taking into account the wire geometry is used to precisely calibrate all parameters of the rf field coupling ( see methods ) .    to control the spin motion we turn on the state - dependent dressing , by ramping up the rf currents in @xmath43  ms with @xmath36  mhz , directly after preparing the equal superposition of @xmath7 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the ramp time is slow compared to the inverse larmor frequency and the inverse radial trap frequency , but sudden with respect to any axial motion . </S>",
    "<S> we use the two circular rf polarizations and various rf amplitudes , corresponding to @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for each time step </S>",

    "<S> results for the full range of dressing parameters are depicted in figure  [ fig : scaledinteractions ] . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : scaledinteractions](a ) shows the calculated interaction strengths taken from equation   as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared the measured widths of the distributions as a function of time with solutions of the coupled 1d - gpe . </S>",
    "<S> these widths and the corresponding simulations for one fixed hold time of 44  ms are shown in figure  [ fig : scaledinteractions](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measured widths follow the 1d - gpe simulations closely ( taking into account the finite optical resolution ) , with the biggest uncertainties originating from atom number fluctuations which cause the peak linear density to vary between @xmath57m@xmath58 and @xmath59m@xmath58 throughout the entire data set ( systematic uncertainty shown by shaded regions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid vertical line at @xmath60 indicates the point where the difference in interaction strengths is minimized [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scaledinteractions](a ) ] with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 differing by less than 0.05% ( 100 times reduction in differences when compared to the unmodified interactions ) . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are of interest for comparing to bethe ansatz solutions which require spin - independent interactions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to explain the data we have to consider both the effect of rf - dressing on the collisional interaction strengths as well as the state - dependent modification to the axial potential . </S>",
    "<S> a simple analytical description can be obtained using a thomas - fermi description near the cloud center where the cloud shape is an inverted parabola . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of the state - dependence of the axial trapping frequency and of the interactions can then be expressed as a net harmonic potential characterised by an effective state - dependent curvature @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we solve for the effective curvatures ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scaledinteractions]c ) for @xmath62 in our experiments in terms of @xmath31 , and find @xmath63 here the first term on the right - hand side reflects the modification to the external axial potential and the second and third terms deal with the modified interactions @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the axial curvature of the bare potential is @xmath64 and @xmath65 corresponds to the fraction of the population transferred to state @xmath9 ( @xmath66 for our experiments ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line at @xmath67 in fig .  [ fig : scaledinteractions ] indicates the point where the difference in interactions is compensated by the state - dependent longitudinal potential and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this point is characterized by small equal curvatures of the effective potentials ( including interaction energy ) for both states [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scaledinteractions](c ) ] , which result in frozen spin dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are important for applications with on - chip atomic clocks , to minimize inhomogeneous broadening due to mean field shifts . for @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> the difference in interaction strengths is further enhanced and the time evolution of the spin dynamics becomes inverted , with focusing of state @xmath7 while state @xmath9 is pushed outward , as is visible in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scaledinteractions](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : dressedevo ] shows the full time evolution of the spin polarization for two selected rf - dressing parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the selected cases are : dressing of state @xmath7 alone ( @xmath37 , @xmath70 ) [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dressedevo](a ) ] and dressing state @xmath9 alone ( @xmath38 , @xmath71 ) [ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> qualitatively state @xmath9 focuses faster with rf dressing applied to state @xmath7 , when compared to the case of state independent potentials [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : data&gp](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the simulated density profiles reveal a rich and dynamic nonlinear evolution of the spin polarization , reminiscent of filament propagation in optical systems with competing nonlinearities @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this detailed structure depends sensitively on the precise values of the dressing . </S>",
    "<S> the development and propagation of this fine structure in the spin polarization is partially observed in the experimental data , but is not fully resolved due to the finite imaging resolution . </S>",
    "<S> convolving the simulated profiles with the point - spread function of our imaging system yields excellent agreement with all of the data . with weak dressing of state @xmath9 ( @xmath71 ) it is possible to freeze spin dynamics altogether such that the two states maintain their overlap and the widths remain constant ( apart from a small in - phase quadrupole oscillation and decay from state @xmath9 ) , see figure  [ fig : dressedevo](b , d ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) shows the evolution with rf parameters corresponding to equal inter - atomic interactions ( @xmath74 ) , and ( c ) equal effective potentials ( @xmath75 ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that by introducing a small state - dependence to the radial trapping potential using rf dressing we can precisely tune the 1d interaction parameters in a two - component quantum gas by more than 10% , over an experimentally significant range . in our experiments </S>",
    "<S> this modification competes with the state dependence of the axial trapping and provides a new `` knob '' to control spin motion , leading to tuneable nonlinear behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> our method can be naturally extended in several ways . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , control over the interactions _ without _ the accompanying state - dependence of the axial trapping can be obtained by using one - dimensional box - shaped potentials  @xcite . by introducing an additional displacement of the transverse potential in a state - dependent way it is possible to further reduce @xmath56 , allowing all three interaction parameters to be tuned independently , something that is not generally possible with a magnetically controlled feshbach resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed spin dynamics depend critically on the precise differences in interaction strengths . for @xmath0rb , </S>",
    "<S> the three relevant scattering lengths are nearly equal and therefore weak dressing is sufficient to tune the system parameters to the point of symmetric interactions or to where the spin dynamics become frozen . since the rf parameters can be precisely known , such experiments could also allow precision determination of the scattering length differences . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , tuning the system parameters around the point of spin - independent interactions strongly affects the dispersion relation of the spin excitations @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> this allows the spin velocity to be tuned around zero , providing a new handle for the study of spin waves in one - dimensional atomic gases .    </S>",
    "<S> tunable interactions in two - component quantum gases have important applications in the areas of spin - squeezing and quantum metrology  @xcite , and the ability to control spin motion opens new avenues for future studies of quantum coherence in interacting quantum systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our current experiments are performed in the weakly interacting 1d regime and at low temperature , and we find that a description based on two coupled 1d gross - pitaevskii equations is sufficient to describe our data . </S>",
    "<S> the methods presented here to tune interactions are not limited to this regime , however . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we plan to apply these methods to systems with stronger interactions ( e.g. , by lowering the 1d density ) and with higher temperatures </S>",
    "<S> . this will provide experimental tests of ( and challenges to ) more sophisticated theoretical methods , for both equilibrium and non - equilibrium phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it will be possible to experimentally explore predictions of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz for the two - component bose gas  @xcite and to explore quantum quenches in strongly interacting 1d systems by dynamical control over the spin - dependent interactions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we expect that the experimental control over spin motion and interactions , as demonstrated here , will benefit the realization of spin-``charge '' separation in a bose gas @xcite .    </S>",
