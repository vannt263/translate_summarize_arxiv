    "in 2012 , the atlas and cms collaborations at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) discovered a new particle whose mass is approximately 125 gev @xcite .",
    "its spin and cp properties as well as its couplings with other particles have been analyzed .",
    "so far , no clear evidence that contradicts the properties of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson has been found .",
    "the sm is now confirmed as a low energy effective theory that successfully explains phenomena below the tev scale .",
    "the sm , however , bears problems and puzzles that should be solved in a more fundamental theory .",
    "these include the hierarchy problem and the charge quantization problem . to keep the mass of the higgs boson to the electroweak scale , an unnatural huge cancellation between its bare mas squared and quadratically divergent contributions from radiative corrections is required .",
    "although the electric charges of the sm particles can be theoretically arbitrary , they must be fractionally quantized to account for the neutrality of atoms .",
    "it is a natural idea to employ larger symmetries to tackle such problems .",
    "indeed , the above - mentioned problems can be resolved by supersymmetry ( susy ) and grand unification @xcite . in supersymmetric extensions of the sm",
    ", the quadratically divergent contributions from sm particles to the higgs boson mass squared are canceled with those from their partner particles , and therefore the hierarchy problem is avoided .",
    "grand unified theories ( guts ) give a unified description of the three sm gauge groups and sm fermions .",
    "if the gauge group of a gut is ( semi-)simple , the electric charges of the sm particles are automatically quantized .",
    "therefore , models that have both susy and a grand unified symmetry are well - motivated candidates for physics beyond the sm .",
    "although susy gut models contain such appealing features , there are several unattractive points .",
    "the typical gut scale where the three gauge couplings are unified is around @xmath2 gev in usual susy guts . according to the decoupling theorem ,",
    "the effects of the heavy gut particles are negligible at the tev scale @xcite .",
    "one can obtain information on physics realized at the gut scale only through the relations among the mass and coupling parameters measured at the tev scale .",
    "in addition , an unnaturally huge mass splitting between the colored higgs triplets and the electroweak higgs doublets are assumed to suppress the proton decay rate adequately .",
    "many mechanisms have been proposed to solve this doublet - triplet splitting problem @xcite .",
    "recently , a susy gut model that predicts the existence of new particles accessible at collider experiments is proposed @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the doublet - triplet mass splitting is naturally realized by supersymmetrizing the grand gauge - higgs unification ( ghu ) model @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric grand gauge - higgs unification ( sgghu ) is constructed on an extra dimension whose compactification scale is around @xmath2 gev , where the gut gauge symmetry is broken by the hosotani mechanism @xcite : the non - trivial vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the fifth component of one of the gauge fields is responsible for the symmetry breaking . in the sgghu model , a color octet superfield , an @xmath1 triplet superfield with hypercharge zero and",
    "a neutral singlet superfield appear at the tev scale as a by - product .",
    "as compared to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the higgs sector is extended by the triplet and singlet superfields .    in this talk , we discuss the properties of the sgghu higgs sector , and investigate its phenomenological signatures expected at collider experiments .",
    "we evaluate the masses and couplings of the higgs sector particles solving renormalization group equation ( rge ) from the gut scale to the electroweak scale .",
    "our emphasis is that precision measurements of the masses and couplings of the higgs bosons at the lhc and future electron - positron colliders such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite and the clic @xcite play an important role in distinguishing particle physics models .",
    "the sgghu model is a good example to show that low - energy collider experiments are capable of testing gut scale physics .",
    "here , we briefly discuss the structure of the higgs sector of the low energy effective theory of the sgghu model , which contains an @xmath1 triplet chiral superfield @xmath3 and an neutral singlet chiral superfield @xmath4 as well as the two mssm higgs doublets @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the superpotential of the sgghu higgs sector is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the pauli matrices .",
    "the fact that @xmath4 and @xmath3 stem from the gauge supermultiplet leads to the following remarkable features .",
    "although trilinear self - couplings among @xmath4 and @xmath3 are not forbidden in the general higgs superpotential that contains the triplet and singlet superfields , such terms are absent in our model .",
    "the newly introduced higgs couplings @xmath10 and @xmath11 are unified with the sm gauge coupling constants at the gut scale .",
    "therefore , this model can predict the properties of the higgs bosons with less ambiguity .",
    "the soft susy breaking terms in the higgs potential read @xmath12.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the values of the soft parameters at the tev scale are also determined by solving the rges .",
    "due to the top yukawa contributions to the rges , radiative electroweak symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "then , in the higgs sector , four cp - even , three cp - odd and three charged higgs bosons appear as physical particles .",
    "the vev of the neutral component of the triplet higgs boson @xmath13 is obtained from the minimization conditions of the higgs potential , and must be less than @xmath14 to satisfy the rho parameter constraint . since this value is sufficiently small compared to @xmath15 , @xmath16 is neglected in our computation of the higgs boson masses and couplings .",
    "let us turn to discussions about rg evolution of the coupling constants and mass parameters in the sgghu model . as a consequence of introducing the light adjoint multiplets , the successful gauge coupling unification is disturbed . in our model , by adding extra incomplete @xmath0 matter multiplets , the gauge coupling unification can be easily recovered .",
    "an successful example for the matter multiplets is a set of two vectorlike pairs of @xmath17 @xmath18 , one of @xmath19 @xmath20 and one of @xmath21 @xmath22 , where the numbers in the parentheses are @xmath23 , @xmath1 and @xmath24 quantum numbers , respectively @xcite .",
    "[ fig : couplings ] shows the evolution of the higgs triplet and singlet coupling constants @xmath10 ( red line ) and @xmath11 ( blue ) , as well as the gauge coupling constants @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( green ) at the one loop level as a function of the energy scale .",
    "the coupling constants are normalized such that @xmath28 for the singlet higgs coupling and @xmath29 for the @xmath24 gauge coupling .",
    "the higgs trilinear coupling constants at the tev - scale are @xmath30     ( red line ) and @xmath31 ( blue ) as well as the gauge coupling constants @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( green ) at the one loop level as a function of the energy scale.,width=340 ]    the soft breaking parameters at the susy breaking scale are evaluated by solving the rges .",
    "[ fig : couplings ] shows that we have strong gauge couplings at the gut scale . to satisfy the gluino mass limit @xcite , the unified gaugino mass at the gut scale needs to be large",
    "consequently , soft sfermion and higgs masses at the susy breaking scale are typically multi - tev .",
    "this means that one needs some tuning to have successful radiative electroweak symmetry breaking . in spite of the difficulties",
    ", we will show that one can also obtain soft higgs masses of the order of @xmath35 gev by tuning among the input parameters at the gut scale .",
    "first , let us discuss the prediction about the sm - like higgs boson mass , which is affected by the @xmath1 triplet and singlet higgs multiplets .",
    "when the soft scalar masses of the triplet and singlet are relatively large , the mass of the sm - like higgs boson is approximately given by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath38-boson mass , @xmath39 is the top quark mass , @xmath40 is the averaged stop mass , and @xmath41 . in the mssm , for the sm - like higgs boson mass to reach @xmath42 using the large stop loop contribution , one needs very large stop masses even in the maximal stop mixing scenario @xcite . as in the next - to - mssm ( nmssm ) @xcite , in our model",
    "the sm - like higgs boson mass is lifted up by the higgs trilinear couplings with the triplet and singlet superfield , in particular , for small @xmath43 region . in our numerical computation of the masses of the higgs scalars and superparticle ,",
    "we have used the public numerical code ` suspect ` @xcite after including the contributions from the triplet and singlet higgs superfields , instead of the approximate formula eq.([eq : higgs_mass ] ) . since fine tuning for the gut - scale input parameters",
    "is required , we show results based on some benchmark points that reproduce the correct sm - like higgs boson mass . taking theoretical uncertainties into account , we allow the mass range @xmath44 .",
    "we consider the following three typical scenarios :    * mixings between the sm - like higgs boson and the other higgs bosons are small .",
    "* mixings between the sm - like higgs boson and the triplet and singlet higgs bosons are small . *",
    "the triplet and singlet higgs bosons affect the sm - like higgs boson couplings .",
    "three successful benchmark points for the gut - scale input parameters and the resulting tev - scale parameters obtained after rg evolution are shown in tab . [",
    "tab : benchmark - gut ] and [ tab : benchmark - tev ] , respectively .",
    ".benchmark points for the gut - scale input parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     above discussions show that new physics models can be distinguished through exhaustive analysis of the masses and couplings of the higgs sector particles at the lhc and future electron - positron colliders .",
    "even when the additional higgs bosons are beyond the reach of direct discovery , their effects can be indirectly probed by precise measurements of the sm - like higgs boson couplings and the mssm higgs boson masses .",
    "a new electron - positron collider is mandatory for exploring the higgs properties and the underlying theory .",
    "in the susy @xmath0 gut model where the hosotani mechanism is responsible for the @xmath0 gauge symmetry breaking , the higgs sector at the tev scale contains a higgs triplet and singlet chiral superfields as well as the two mssm higgs doublets .",
    "we have computed the couplings between the sm - like higgs boson and sm particles .",
    "the deviations of these coupling constants from the corresponding sm predictions are shown to be @xmath45 when the triplet and singlet higgs boson masses are smaller than @xmath46 .",
    "such deviations can be measured at future electron - positron colliders .",
    "when the masses of the mssm - like charged higgs boson and the mssm - like cp - odd higgs boson are below @xmath47 , their mass difference is larger than the mssm prediction by @xmath45 - @xmath48 , and measurable at the lhc . by combining these observations",
    ", we can distinguish our model , mssm and nmssm .",
    "we emphasise that the supersymmetric grand gauge - higgs unification model is a good example to show capability of colliders for testing gut scale physics .",
