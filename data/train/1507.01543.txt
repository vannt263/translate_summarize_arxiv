    "the analysis on singular manifolds has a long history , and the subject is to a large degree motivated by the study of partial differential equations ( with or without boundary conditions ) and generalizations of index theory to the singular setting , e.g. atiyah - singer type index theorems .",
    "one particular approach is based on the observation first made by a. connes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that groupoids are good models for singular spaces .",
    "the outlines for a pseudodifferential calculus on singular foliations were made precise for the general case of ( longitudinally smooth ) groupoids later by b. monthubert , v. nistor , a. weinstein and p. xu ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "such a calculus can be defined on manifolds with singularities of various types in a unified and general setting .",
    "a notion of global ellipticity with fredholm conditions is then also possible . on the other hand",
    "it is important for applications in the study of pde s to also pose boundary conditions and a parametrix for general boundary value problems .",
    "it has been a hard problem to incorporate boundary conditions in the singular context .",
    "the construction of a refined parametrix , with appropriate fredholm conditions , in such a setting is particularly difficult for technical reasons ( the small calculus is not sufficient ) . in this work",
    "we will enlarge the groupoid pseudodifferential calculus and develop a notion of general pseudodifferential boundary value problems for the groupoid calculus .",
    "the most natural approach seems to be a generalization of the boutet de monvel calculus .",
    "boutet de monvel s calculus ( e.g. @xcite ) was established in 1971 .",
    "this calculus provides a convenient and general tool to study the classical boundary value problems . at the same time parametrices",
    "are contained in the calculus and it is closed under composition of elements .",
    "the elements of boutet de monvel s algebra consist of matrices of operators which act in a suitable sense as pseudodifferential operators but have non - pseudodifferential components .",
    "it is thus our aim in this paper to first describe the calculus in terms of groupoids and groupoid actions on suitable spaces .",
    "we start by recalling a characterization of boutet de monvel operators in terms of conormal distributions due to grubb / hrmander .",
    "then we recover the characterization by letting groupoids act on suitable spaces .",
    "we apply this understanding to the following problem : given a manifold with corners and a lie structure encoding geometric singularities ( the boundary _ at infinity _ ) our objective is to pose boundary conditions on _ regular _ strata which may intersect the _ singular _ boundary at infinity . a convenient way to do",
    "this is to construct a boutet de monvel calculus adapted to this situation .",
    "similar problems have been considered in the literature before .",
    "the closest approach to our problem is a work by t. krainer ( cf .",
    "there he considers from our view a special case of the problem on a manifold with polycylindrical ends and cusp type singularities .",
    "the approach is also considerably different from our own : first a local boutet de monvel calculus is constructed using the collar neighborhood structure of the manifold with corners .",
    "then the calculus is obtained iteratively and closedness under composition is proven via induction on the codimension of the manifold .",
    "the inductive approach is also employed for manifolds with fibered corners in the construction of a pseudodifferential calculus in @xcite .",
    "the inductive step in these proofs depends strongly on the particular type of singularities ( e.g. fibred or generalized cusps etc . ) . therefore this will not be the right approach in the more general setting we are considering here .",
    "in our case we consider the following data : a lie manifold @xmath7 with boundary @xmath6 which is an embedded , transversal hypersurface @xmath8 and which is a lie submanifold of @xmath9 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "from @xmath9 we define the double @xmath10 at the hypersurface @xmath6 which is a lie manifold @xmath11 .",
    "transversality of @xmath6 in relation to @xmath0 is briefly described by the following equality @xmath12    for each given hyperface @xmath13 .",
    "introduce the following notation for interior and boundary : by @xmath14 we mean the singular , stratified boundary of the manifold with corners @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath15    the hypersurface @xmath6 is endowed with a lie structure as in @xcite : @xmath16    the goal is to construct a boutet de monvel calculus for general pseudodifferential boundary value problems adapted to this data .    the pseudodifferential calculus on a lie manifold was constructed in @xcite via representations of pseudodifferential operators on a lie groupoid .",
    "this representation also yields closedness under composition .",
    "we enlarge the calculus to take boundary conditions into account by first working on the groupoid level .    in this approach at first we proceed as usual , i.e. find a lie algebroid @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .    via integrating the algebroid @xmath19",
    "we obtain a lie groupoid @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .    on the boundary lie structure on @xmath6",
    "we also obtain a groupoid @xmath22 in the same fashion with an associated lie algebroid @xmath23 .",
    "the other essential ingredient in our construction is a _ refined _ blow - up @xmath24 of @xmath25 with regard to the diagonal @xmath26 and @xmath27 of @xmath28 with regard to @xmath26 as manifolds with corners .",
    "the singularities at the ( codimension @xmath29 ) intersection of @xmath6 with the singular boundary of @xmath0 essentially are _ blown - up _ and the boundary problem is posed on the blown - up version of the submanifolds .",
    "we require there to be an isomorphism @xmath30 between these longitudinally smooth spaces @xmath24 and @xmath27 .",
    "since the hypersurface @xmath6 divides the double @xmath10 we denote by @xmath31 the _ right _ half and by @xmath3 the _ left _ half .",
    "these halves have corresponding lie structures and hence corresponding groupoids @xmath32 .    on the symbols of pseudodifferential operators from the groupoid calculus we impose a _ fiberwise _ or @xmath33-transmission property with regard to the subgroupoids @xmath34 .",
    "the compatibility requirements we will state particularly imply that @xmath35 have fiberwise boundaries consisting of the fibers @xmath36 for @xmath37 .    the boutet de",
    "monvel operators are defined and adapted to data given by the tuple @xmath38 .",
    "this tuple merely depends on the initial lie structure and integrability properties of the corresponding lie algebroids . in this sense",
    "the closedness under composition is ultimately equivalent to the fact that the lie algebroids occuring in the theory are integrable .",
    "the boutet de monvel calculus adapted to this data should then be an algebra @xmath39 ( of order @xmath40 and type @xmath40 ) which is a subalgebra of : @xmath41    the first objective of this work is the proof of the following result .",

    "this means that given the order @xmath43 we have @xmath44 [ athm : bm ]    in the next section we describe a _ vector - representation _ of our algebra .    just as in the case of a pseudodifferential operator on a groupoid",

    "<S> starting with the example of @xmath5-vector fields we show that there are two groupoids integrating the lie structure on @xmath0 and @xmath6 respectively which form a bimodule structure ( a groupoid correspondence ) and in mild cases these groupoids are isomorphic inside the category of lie groupoids ( morita equivalent ) . with the help of the bimodule structure and </S>",
    "<S> canonically defined manifolds with corners , which are blow - ups in particular cases , we define a class of extended boutet de monvel operators . </S>",
    "<S> then we describe the restricted transmission boutet de monvel calculus by truncation of the extended operators . </S>",
    "<S> we define the representation for restricted operators and show closedness under composition with the help of an analog of the ammann , lauter , nistor representation theorem . </S>",
