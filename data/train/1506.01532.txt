    "the flow of heat is a common phenomenon in nature .",
    "however , how to macroscopically manipulate the heat flow at will remains poorly explored in the literature , which , however , is very important for human life or military uses , say , efficient refrigerators , solar cells , energy - saving buildings , or infrared camouflage .",
    "it is known that our world has been changing by _ intelligent _ electronic components or _ intelligent _ materials . here",
    "intelligent _ means that the component or material has properties that can be tuned in a controllable manner by external stimuli .",
    "for example , electronic diodes belong to intelligent electronic components , which have much lower resistance to electric current along one direction than the other ; shape memory alloys are a kind of intelligent materials , which can recover their original shapes by stimuli ( say , heating  @xcite or adding an external magnetic field  @xcite ) after big deformations . manipulating thermal conduction equations to achieve desired temperature distributions or heat flux patterns in thermal metamaterials",
    "is promising for thermal extensions of _ intelligent _ electronic components or _ intelligent _ materials . as a result",
    ", this manipulation might produce a unique class of intelligent thermal metamaterials , thus yielding a novel ( intelligent ) way for macroscopically controlling the flow of heat at will .",
    "for this purpose , let s trace back to the birth of transformation optics theory  @xcite .    in 2006 , leonhardt and pendry _ et al .",
    "_ independently established the transformation optics theory , which leads to a new concept of invisibility cloaking  @xcite .",
    "such a significant progress soon enlightened a lot of scientists in different fields since it offers a powerful method for designing metamaterials with new properties like optical illusions  @xcite .",
    "in essence , this theory demands the form invariance of domain equations under linear coordinate transformations .",
    "this characteristic serves as the foundation of transformation optics theory .",
    "inspired by it , some researchers extended the transformation mapping theory to the domain of thermal conduction , and then proposed a type of thermal metamaterials , which are called thermal cloaks , for steady state heat flow ( i.e. , the temperature , @xmath0 , is independent of time ) by using inhomogeneous anisotropic materials  @xcite .",
    "the original intention of designing such type of thermal metamaterials is to hide an object inside the cloak from the detection through measuring the external temperature distribution , and thus these metamaterials can thermally protect the central region containing the object .",
    "so far , the steady - state thermal cloak  @xcite and its theoretical extensions  @xcite have been experimentally realized or developed  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , researchers also designed a lot of thermal metamaterials with novel thermal characteristics beyond cloaking  @xcite , such as concentrators  @xcite .",
    "the concentrator helps to focus heat flux in a particular region , and thus yields a higher temperature gradient inside the region , which can be used to improve the efficiency for thermal - to - electrical conversion ( the seebeck effect  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the existing thermal metamaterials published in the literature  @xcite do nt have the essential feature of intelligence , namely , they lack the ability to automatically sense and respond to the change of environmental temperature .",
    "the reason is that within the framework of transformation thermotics ( or thermodynamics as also named by some other famous scholars )  @xcite , the property of thermal metamaterials can influence the temperature field , but not vice versa due to temperature - independent thermal conductivities under consideration .",
    "evidently , it becomes necessary to develop the theory of nonlinear transformation thermotics  @xcite , which takes into account the fact that many materials have a temperature - dependent thermal conductivity .",
    "this theory suggests that new function can be introduced into thermal metamaterials by using a temperature - dependent transformation . in this work",
    ", we shall show that thermal metamaterials can be made intelligent indeed based on the above idea by presenting a new thermal metamaterial  intelligent thermal cloak - concentrator , which can automatically change from a cloak ( concentrator ) to a concentrator ( cloak ) when the applied temperature field decreases ( increases ) .",
    "the traditional thermal cloak helps to prevent heat from traveling inside the central region without disturbing the temperature distribution outside , and thus thermally hides an object inside it . as schematically drawn in fig .",
    "1(a ) , a two - dimensional thermal cloak is designed according to a compression transformation which maps a circle of radius @xmath1 to a ring with interior radius @xmath2 and exterior radius @xmath1 . in a polar coordinate system ,",
    "the transformation between original coordinates ( @xmath3 ) and transformed ones ( @xmath4 ) is written as @xmath5 according to this transformation , the thermal conductivity @xmath6 of the cloak is calculated from the equation of traditional transformation thermotics , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the jacobian matrix of the transformation written in cartesian coordinate system , @xmath9 is the thermal conductivity of the background , and @xmath10 is the determinant of @xmath8 .",
    "the traditional thermal concentrator guides more heat flux into the central region and increases the temperature gradient inside . as fig .",
    "1(b ) shows , the corresponding transformation of a two - dimensional concentrator maps a ring with interior radius @xmath11 and exterior radius @xmath1 to a ring with interior radius @xmath2 and exterior radius @xmath1 .",
    "the formulas of this transformation in a polar coordinate system are @xmath12 the thermal conductivity of the concentrator can also be calculated by substituting the jacobian of eq .",
    "( [ concen1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ kappa1 ] ) .    a comparison between eq .",
    "( [ cloak1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ concen1 ] ) reveals an interesting fact : if we replace the @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ concen1 ] ) with @xmath13 , we get exactly the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ cloak1 ] ) .",
    "the reason behind it is that the original configuration of the transformation is a circle , and can be regarded as a ring with interior radius @xmath13 .",
    "this resemblance between the principle of the cloak and the concentrator inspires us to combine these two thermal metamaterials together and design a new kind of intelligent materials .",
    "this device will automatically switches from a concentrator to a cloak or vice versa as environmental temperature changes .",
    "however , the traditional transformation thermotics does not serve as a proper tool to design it because the temperature wo nt affect the behavior of the device .",
    "thus an extension of the traditional theory is needed .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we ve shown that the transformation thermotics can be generalized by introducing the nonlinear effect of temperature - dependent thermal conductivities .",
    "this theory enables us to make use of a certain temperature - dependent transformation to achieve novel functions such as switchable thermal cloaking and macro thermal diodes based on the cloaking  @xcite .",
    "the foundation of this approach is the equivalence between such transformation and a normal transformation applied on nonlinear materials ( whose conductivity depends on temperature ) .    since we can change a concentrator into a cloak by simply replacing @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ concen1 ] ) with @xmath13 , the cloak - concentrator can be designed on the basis of a function @xmath14 which switches between @xmath11 and @xmath13 at different temperature @xmath0 .",
    "then the @xmath0-dependent transformation is @xmath15 the thermal conductivity @xmath16 of our device is calculated from a relation similar to eq .",
    "( [ kappa1 ] ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the jacobian matrix corresponding to the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ concen - cloak ] ) written in the cartesian coordinate system .",
    "the result expressed in the polar coordinate system is @xmath19 ,       \\kappa_{\\theta}(t)=\\kappa_0\\left[{1+\\dfrac{r_{2}(r^*(t)-r_1)}{r'(r_2-r^*(t))}}\\right]^{-1 } ,      \\label{kappa2}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the radial and azimuthal components of @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the specific term of function @xmath14 is determined according to the desired behavior of the cloak - concentrator . in this study , we want the device to behave like a concentrator when the environmental temperature is lower than a critical temperature , @xmath22 , such that the central region inside it receives more heat flux from the heat source . and when the environmental temperature increases to be higher than @xmath22 , we want the device to behave like a cloak in order to avoid heat flux from coming inside the central region . in this case , an object located in the central region is able to experience a relatively more stable thermal environment . to achieve the above function",
    ", we resort to the following form of @xmath14 , @xmath23^{-1}\\right\\ } ,      r^*(t)=r_3/\\left[1+\\mathrm{e}^{\\beta(t - t_c)}\\right ] ,      \\label{r*}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a scaling factor which determines the sensitivity of the device to temperature .",
    "in order to show the effect of the bifunctional device , we perform finite element simulations based on the commercial software comsol multiphysics to see if the metamaterials work when the applied temperature fields change . without loss of generality , the units of length , temperature and thermal conductivity are defined as @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the width of the simulation box ) , the initial temperature and the conductivity of background , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the scales of the length , temperature and conductivity are nondimensionalized throughout this work .",
    "an annulus with interior radius @xmath27 and exterior radius @xmath28 is set in a box with size @xmath29 as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the thermal conductivities of the background and the central region are set as @xmath30 .",
    "the thermal conductivity of the device is calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ kappa2 ] ) for @xmath31 .",
    "heat diffuses from the left boundary with high temperature @xmath32 to the right boundary with low temperature @xmath33 .",
    "meanwhile , the upper and lower boundaries of the simulation box are thermally isolated .",
    "the simulation results of the switchable device are shown in fig .",
    "2(a , b ) where the critical temperature @xmath22 is set to be @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "2(a ) for low temperature ( @xmath35 ) , we observe that the concentrator is focusing the heat flow into the central region and the temperature gradient is raised . on the other hand , when the environmental temperature is high enough ( @xmath36 ) as in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the cloaking effect is `` turned on '' . the heat flux in the cloak",
    "are guided to detour around the core ( namely , the central region ) and the temperature inside this core is turned to be a constant .",
    "due to the antisymmetry , a switchable device between a cloak in low temperature and a concentrator in high temperature can also be worked out on the same footing .    although the thermal conductivity of such a device is inhomogeneous and anisotropic [ fig .",
    "2(a , b ) ] , for future experimental realization we may resort to the effective medium theory ( emt ) @xcite which utilizes a laminated structure as an approximation of anisotropic materials .",
    "according to the emt , one layer contains two alternating homogeneous isotropic sub - layers of thicknesses @xmath37 and @xmath38 with conductivities @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in a polar coordinate system , the effective parameters for a layer can be obtained from @xmath41 where @xmath42 . in this work , we set @xmath43 for simulations .",
    "the method based on the emt has been successful in the experimental demonstration of thermal cloaks  @xcite . for the case of concentrators ,",
    "the transformation is based on extensions ; therefore , the array orientation of the alternating sub - layers should be rotated with an angle of @xmath44 .",
    "considering both the aforementioned transformations , as shown in fig .",
    "2(c , d ) , we divide the device into 400 grids ( which contain 5 layers consisting of 10 sub - layers in the radial direction and 20 layers consisting of 40 sub - layers in the azimuthal direction ) .",
    "( [ emt1 ] ) is considered to be a reliable tool in realizing the theoretical design , but the resulting forms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ emt1 ] ) are too complicated .",
    "so in this study , we propose that instead of getting the thermal conductivities directly from eq .",
    "( [ emt1 ] ) , we solve two limiting cases of concentrators and cloaks separately , @xmath45 in the above equations , the superscript , co ( or cl ) , denotes the case of traditional concentrators ( or cloaks ) without temperature dependency .",
    "then , according to the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ emt2 ] ) , we find the desired relations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 with respect to temperature , @xmath46^{-1}.      \\label{emt3}\\ ] ]    now we are in a position to assemble the facility . evidently , fig .",
    "2(c , d ) displays the same switching effect between concentrators and cloaks as presented in fig .",
    "2(a , b ) .    furthermore , for clarity , in fig .  3",
    ", we choose the temperature gradient inside the device to characterize the state of the intelligent thermal metamaterial . since @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the heat flux and @xmath6 is the thermal conductivity of the central region ( @xmath49 ) , the temperature gradient represents the amount of heat flux in @xmath50-direction .",
    "a high value of gradient in the central region indicates the device is working as a concentrator , while the near zero value denotes that the cloaking effect is activated .",
    "for different temperature fields applied , the variation of the temperature gradients are displayed in fig .",
    "the results show that the new thermal metamaterial can make a quick response to the change of environmental temperature , and the transition process is sharp around the critical point @xmath22 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the simulation results based on the emt are also provided and the behaviors of the metamaterial are in good agreement with the theory .",
    "the slight amount of temperature gradient at the cloak side is due to a relatively few number of layers ( 5 layers as plotted in fig .",
    "3 ) in the radial direction .",
    "this non - zero temperature gradient can be further reduced to approach zero with more alternative rings of thinner thickness . as an evidence ,",
    "the concentrator effects for the nonlinear transformation theory and emt are very close to each other because we used 20 layers of materials in the azimuthal direction ( fig .",
    "by taking into account the role of nonlinearity in thermal conduction , we have designed a unique class of intelligent bifunctional thermal metamaterials  thermal cloak - concentrators with intelligence .",
    "the cloak - concentrator is able to function as two traditional metamaterials ( namely , a cloak and a concentrator ) at different environmental temperatures and quickly switches from one to the other as temperature changes . with this new device , the heat flux amount of a certain region can be automatically adjusted according to the environmental temperature . for the convenience of future experimental demonstration",
    ", we have performed simulations based on the design of assembling homogeneous isotropic materials according to the emt ( effective medium theory ) ; see fig .  2(c , d ) .",
    "the thermal conductivities of theses materials vary with temperature as determined by eq .",
    "( [ emt3 ] ) , indicating that the value of conductivities should increase or decrease rapidly with temperature .",
    "fortunately , researchers have found several kinds of materials whose thermal conductivities have this behavior  @xcite , which provide a viable approach to realize the intelligent thermal cloak - concentrator proposed in this work .",
    "owing to the compression transformation of the original coordinate system , the perfect cloaking effect provides a dead core inside the device , where the temperature gradient are reduced to zero . on the contrary",
    ", the concentrator can raise the gradient in the central region due to the extension transformation of the shell .",
    "since for a given thermal conductivity the temperature gradient determines the amount of heat flux , the thermal cloak can significantly reduce the heat flux inside it , but the thermal concentrator can raise the heat flux amount inside to an abnormally high value . naturally , if one device can switch between a cloak and a concentrator , the amount of its inner heat flux can vary in a wide range ; if the switching effect can be triggered by changing the environmental temperature , the desired intelligence is achieved .",
    "such a bifunctional thermal metamaterial can automatically cause its central region to heat ( or cool ) in case of a low ( or high ) environmental temperature .",
    "in particular , it can be used to switch on or off the seebeck effect  @xcite when the applied temperature varies , thus achieving a so - called switchable seebeck effect .",
    "besides , it provides guidance for macroscopically manipulating heat flow at will in many thermal management problems , which are related to heat preservation , dissipation , camouflage  @xcite or illusions  @xcite in various kinds of areas ranging from energy - saving machines / buildings to military uses .",
    "in addition , due to the similarity between the governing equations , our consideration adopted in this work can be extended to obtain the counterparts of such intelligent multifunctional thermal metamaterials in other disciplines like optics , electromagnetics , acoustics , and elastodynamics .",
