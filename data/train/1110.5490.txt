    "with the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern collecting plenty of data , tests of the standard model ( sm ) have entered a new era . concerning the exploration of the quark - flavour sector",
    ", the study of cp violation in @xmath3-meson decays at the lhcb experiment is one of the most exciting aspects of this endeavor .",
    "in addition to various , by now",
    " standard \" , @xmath3 decays @xcite , another interesting probe is offered by the @xmath18 channels .",
    "in these decays , new physics ( np ) can enter through cp - violating contributions to @xmath4@xmath5 mixing , which is a strongly suppressed loop phenomenon in the sm ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a determination of the angle @xmath19 of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) of the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix was proposed that relates the @xmath20 decays to @xmath18 through the @xmath8 flavour symmetry of strong interactions .",
    "this method is a variant of the @xmath21 strategy proposed in ref .  @xcite . as was recently shown @xcite , the extraction of @xmath19 from the @xmath21 system is possible at lhcb but can not compete with other strategies @xcite ; the situation for @xmath22 looks even more challenging",
    "however , the @xmath23 mode will still play an important role at lhcb as a  control channel \" , allowing us to take hadronic sm corrections in the extraction of the ut angle @xmath24 from the cp violation in @xmath25 into account @xcite .    in the present paper , we shall follow a similar avenue , assuming that @xmath19 will be measured at lhcb with a precision of a few degrees by means of the corresponding benchmark decays in the next couple of years @xcite .",
    "we will then use the @xmath20 decays to control the hadronic corrections to observables of the @xmath18 modes , which are sensitive to np effects in @xmath4@xmath5 mixing . to be specific , we will study the effective lifetimes and cp - violating rate asymmetries of the @xmath18 decays .",
    "in contrast to the rate asymmetries , the lifetime analysis utilizes the sizable width difference @xmath26 between the @xmath3 mass eigenstates and requires only untagged @xmath3 data samples . here",
    "one does not distinguish between initially present @xmath4 or @xmath5 mesons , which is advantageous from an experimental point of view .",
    "the power of the @xmath18 observables to reveal cp - violating np contributions to @xmath4@xmath5 mixing is limited by doubly cabibbo - suppressed contributions to the decay amplitudes .",
    "we will explore the impact of the relevant non - perturbative parameters , which can not be calculated reliably in qcd , and discuss how they can be determined from @xmath20 data through the @xmath8 flavour symmetry of strong interactions .",
    "thanks to their different ckm amplitude structure , the hadronic parameters are not doubly cabibbo - suppressed in these channels , thereby leading to significant effects in the corresponding observables .    using @xmath27 branching ratio measurements by the belle collaboration , we introduce quantities to probe @xmath8-breaking effects , obtain first constraints on the relevant penguin parameters , and discuss strategies to extract the @xmath1@xmath2 mixing parameters .",
    "we also point out that the @xmath27 and @xmath28 decays are  from a formal point of view ",
    "analogous to the quark  antiquark and tetraquark descriptions of the scalar @xmath13 state in @xmath29 , respectively @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we shall from here on abbreviate the @xmath13 as @xmath30 .    unfortunately , the experimental analyses of the @xmath18 modes are complicated by the reconstruction of the @xmath31 decays .",
    "the most prominent channels are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xcite , which have challenging signatures for studies at hadron colliders . at the future",
    "@xmath39 superkekb and superb projects the prospects of measuring these decays may be more promising .",
    "the outline is as follows : in section  [ sec : ampl ] , we give a brief overview of @xmath1@xmath2 mixing and discuss how it is implemented in the @xmath18 decay amplitudes . in section  [ sec : obs ] , we turn to the effective lifetimes and the cp - violating observables of the @xmath18 transitions . in section  [ sec : contr ] , we focus on the @xmath20 decays and their role as control channels .",
    "finally , we discuss determinations of the @xmath1@xmath2 mixing parameters from the @xmath7 branching ratios in section  [ sec : mix ] , and summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "before focusing on the @xmath18 decays , we will first give a brief overview of @xmath1@xmath2 mixing . the physical @xmath40 and @xmath41 states",
    "are mixtures of the octet and singlet states @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , and can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath44 where latexmath:[\\[|\\eta_8\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\left(|u\\bar u\\rangle + |d\\bar d\\rangle - 2 |s\\bar s\\rangle\\right ) , \\quad    the mixing between the octet and singlet states is a manifestation of the breaking of the @xmath8 flavour symmetry of strong interactions . alternatively , @xmath1@xmath2 mixing can be described in terms of the isospin singlet states @xmath46 into account , we can write the following expressions ( for a recent detailed discussion , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath47 here it has been assumed , for simplicity , that the heavier @xmath48 contains a larger gluonic admixture than the lighter @xmath1 and that the coupling of the latter state to @xmath49 is negligible .",
    "estimates give @xmath50  @xcite , i.e.  @xmath51 , which indicates that the impact of this contribution is suppressed .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath52 is still subject of ongoing studies , using data for processes such as @xmath53 decays and the two - photon width of the @xmath31 mesons ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the full spectrum of results correspond to @xmath54 , with the majority of analyses converging at values of @xmath52 around @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , the relations @xmath56 where the numerical values correspond to @xmath57 , are affected by uncertainties of @xmath58 .",
    "these approximate relations result in the simple expressions @xmath59 which are useful for @xmath8 analyses of non - leptonic @xmath60-meson decays with @xmath31 mesons in the final states @xcite . in our study",
    "we shall follow a similar conceptual avenue , keeping , however , @xmath52 as a free parameter .",
    "the @xmath61 mode has dynamics very similar to @xmath62 with a quark ",
    "antiquark description assumed for the @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the decay topologies are the same , and to obtain the transition amplitude we only need to make the following substitutions in the relevant formulae : @xmath63 i.e.   @xmath64 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite should be replaced by @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath30 mixing angle corresponding to , @xmath66 , is consistent with phenomenological analyses of the scalar @xmath30 state in the quark  antiquark picture ( see ref .",

    "@xcite by making the simple substitution @xmath79 .",

    "as indicated , the gluonic component can only contribute through exchange and penguin annihilation topologies , which are expected to be small in comparison to the tree and penguin topologies , respectively @xcite .",
    "a further suppression comes from @xmath83 .",
    "it is interesting to note in passing that the dynamics are different in @xmath84 decays , where a gluonic component of the @xmath2 can contribute in the leading penguin topologies .",

    "do not indicate any anomalous behaviour , although the currently large errors preclude us from drawing stronger conclusions . in section  [ sec : mix ]",
    ", we will return to the @xmath18 branching ratios , using them to extract the mixing angles @xmath52 and @xmath104 .",
    "a simple observable that is offered by the @xmath18 decays is their effective lifetime , which is defined through the time expectation value @xcite @xmath105 of the untagged rate @xmath106,\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where l and h denote the light and heavy @xmath3 mass eigenstates , respectively , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this lifetime is equivalent to that resulting from a fit of the two exponentials in to a single exponential @xcite .",

    "the most recent update for the theoretical calculation of the @xmath3 width difference is given as follows @xcite : @xmath111    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the evaluation of @xmath112 has been discussed in detail for the @xmath62 channel , which has a cp - odd final state and offers an interesting probe of cp violation @xcite . since the @xmath31 are pseudoscalar mesons with quantum numbers @xmath113 , the final states of @xmath7 are cp even",
    "this sign difference results in @xmath114 here @xmath115 describes direct cp violation , whereas @xmath116 denotes the @xmath117@xmath118 mixing phase , where @xcite @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the sm and np pieces , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath121 is a hadronic phase shift , which can be obtained from @xmath122    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     once the @xmath123 branching ratio has been measured , we can use @xmath124 to determine the mixing angles up to fourfold discrete ambiguities .",
    "it is interesting to note that the 4th powers in these expressions result in precise determinations of @xmath125 and @xmath126 even for branching ratio measurements with significant errors .",
    "if we assume , for illustration , future measurements of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , i.e.  with precisions of 30% , we would obtain @xmath129 and @xmath130 $ ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixangles ] , we have illustrated this method , showing the contours for the current experimental value of @xmath131 in ( [ trig ] ) and our illustrative value of @xmath128 .",
    "it is interesting to include also the constraint from the following ratio @xcite : @xmath132 here penguin annihilation and exchange topologies were again neglected .",
    "the penguin parameters of the @xmath133 decay @xcite are then the same as in the @xmath20 modes . in particular , we expect also the same direct and mixing - induced cp asymmetries . as ( [ r0-def ] )",
    "does not depend on @xmath104 , we can straightforwardly convert the belle result in ( [ bdjpsieta - belle ] ) with br@xmath134  @xcite into @xmath135 the intersection of the corresponding band in fig .",

    "the @xmath18 decays offer interesting insights into the @xmath4@xmath5 mixing parameters through their effective lifetimes and mixing - induced cp asymmetries .",
    "we have performed an analysis of these observables , focusing on hadronic sm corrections which enter in a doubly cabibbo - suppressed way .",
    "it turns out that the effective lifetimes are particularly robust with respect to these effects .",
    "once they have been measured , we can convert the corresponding experimental results into contours in the @xmath137@xmath26 plane .",
    "as far as the mixing - induced cp asymmetries are concerned , measured values within the range @xmath138 would not allow us to distinguish cp - violating np contributions to @xmath4@xmath5 mixing from sm effects , unless we can control the hadronic sm corrections .",
    "we have shown that this can be accomplished with the help of the @xmath20 channels and the @xmath8 flavour symmetry . in these decays ,",
    "the relevant hadronic parameters are not doubly cabibbo - suppressed .",
    "only a branching ratio measurement for @xmath139 is available from the belle collaboration , which we have used to obtain the first value of the @xmath140 observable .",
    "this observable implies ( still pretty poor ) constraints for the hadronic parameters .",
    "the next important step to constrain them in a more stringent way would be the measurement of direct cp violation in @xmath139 .",
    "other interesting control channels in this respect are @xmath23 and @xmath133 . if exchange and penguin annihilation topologies are neglected , they depend on the same penguin parameters @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "it is important to obtain stronger experimental constraints on these topologies in the future through decays such as @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "in addition to exploring cp violation , the @xmath145 and @xmath146 decays allow us to probe non - factorizable @xmath8-breaking effects and offer interesting strategies for determining the @xmath1@xmath2 mixing parameters from their ratios of branching ratios , @xmath131 and @xmath147 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath10 branching ratio , which we predict at the @xmath11 level , has not yet been measured . but using the other currently available @xmath7 data in combinations with @xmath148 , we obtain a picture for the mixing angles @xmath52 and @xmath104 in good agreement with other information .",
    "future measurements of @xmath131 and @xmath147 with 30% precision would result in uncertainties of @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we have seen that the amplitude structures of the @xmath27 and @xmath151 decays correspond formally to the quark  antiquark and tetraquark descriptions of the @xmath30 in @xmath152 , respectively . from the theoretical point of view , the situation in the @xmath7 system is more favourable than in @xmath152 as the hadronic composition of the @xmath30 is still not settled . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter system is more promising from an experimental point of view because of the dominant @xmath153 channel .",
    "the most prominent @xmath31 decays involve photons or neutral pions in the final states , which is a very challenging signature for @xmath60-decay experiments at hadron colliders and appears better suited for the future @xmath39 superkekb and superb projects , which is also reflected by the previous belle and babar analyses of the @xmath154 modes .",
    "we hope that our experimental colleagues will eventually meet the practical challenges , thereby putting yet another system on the roadmap for testing the cp - violating sector of the sm , probing non - factorizable @xmath8-breaking effects and exploring @xmath1@xmath2 mixing .",
