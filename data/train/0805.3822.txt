    "in the past years many new mesons have been discovered through b meson decays .",

    "this structure is denoted as @xmath14 .",
    "the breit wigner fit for this resonance yields the peak mass @xmath15 mev and the width @xmath16 mev .",
    "the product branching fraction is determined to be @xmath17 . since the g - parity of both @xmath18 and @xmath19 is negative",
    ", @xmath20 is a isovector with positive g - parity .",
    "however , @xmath20 is far from being established , no significant evidence for @xmath21 has been observed neither in the total @xmath22 or @xmath23 mass distribution by the babar collaboration @xcite .",
    "there are already many theoretical investigations for the possible structures and the properties of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "because it is very close to the threshold of @xmath24 , and the width of @xmath14 is approximately the same as that of @xmath25 , it is suggested that @xmath14 could be a @xmath26 molecular state @xcite .",
    "other interpretations such as tetraquark state @xcite or a cusp in the @xmath27 channel @xcite are proposed as well . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we suggested how to distinguish the molecule and the tetraquark hypothesis , and @xmath14 as a @xmath1 molecule was studied from the effective field theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors investigated dynamically whether @xmath14 could be a s - wave @xmath1 or @xmath28 molecular state by one - pion exchange and @xmath29 exchange .    in principle , nothing in qcd prevents the formation of nuclear - like bound states of mesons and speculation on the existence of such states dates back thirty years @xcite .",
    "t@xmath30rnqvist suggested that two open flavor heavy mesons can form deuteron - like states due to the strong @xmath31 exchange interaction @xcite , and the monopole form factor is introduced to regularize the interaction potential at short distance . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author investigated the possible heavy flavor molecules base on long distance one pion exchange and short distance quark interchange model .",
    "however , the dynamics of hadronic molecule is still unclear so far . in this work",

    "we shall discuss the interaction between two hadrons at the quark level instead of at the hadron level .",
    "the effective interactions between quarks including the screened color - coulomb , screened linear confinement and spin - spin interactions are employed to describe the interactions between the components of the interacting hadrons .",
