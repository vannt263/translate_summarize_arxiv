    "our identification of na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 as a model nanofilamentary superconductor was motivated by a combination of electronic structure calculations and crystal growth considerations .",
    "firstly , strong crystalline anisotropy ( _ i.e. _ a weak transverse coupling ) is an essential prerequisite for accurately simulating a nanofilamentary superconductor . using _",
    "ab initio _ density functional theory , we have calculated transverse josephson coupling temperatures @xmath23  4.4  k , 3.0  k , 1.0  k for tl@xmath21mo@xmath1se@xmath1 , in@xmath21mo@xmath1se@xmath1 and na@xmath21mo@xmath1se@xmath1 respectively ( see si section i for details ) .",
    "the ground state of na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 has until now remained unknown ; however the extremely weak transverse coupling implies that any superconducting order parameter in this material will be highly anisotropic and exhibit a low phase stiffness .",
    "secondly , the small na atomic radius and elevated growth temperature ( 1750  @xmath24c ) are expected to increase the na ion mobility during crystal synthesis , resulting in a substantially larger na deficiency than the usual @xmath25% observed in tl@xmath21mo@xmath1se@xmath1  @xcite . increasing the na vacancy concentration ( and hence the disorder ) will result in crystals which are more realistic analogies to an inhomogeneous nanofilamentary array .",
    "we therefore synthesized a series of needle - like na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 single crystals with typical lengths 2 - 3  mm ( see methods for details ) .",
    "synchrotron x - ray diffraction measurements indicate a typical 10% na deficiency , _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath2  0.2 , although the ( mo@xmath1se@xmath1)@xmath18 crystal superstructure remains highly ordered .",
    "[ a complete structural refinement is included in the supporting information . ] the influence of the na vacancy - induced disorder can clearly be seen in the electrical resistivity @xmath26 , which rises due to localization at low temperature ( fig .",
    "s6 ) before the crystals undergo a transition to a superconducting ground state ( figs .",
    "[ fig2],[fig3 ] ) .",
    "here we focus on the extent and control of phase - coherent superconductivity as a function of @xmath22 alone .",
    "a brief discussion of the possibility of tuning the superconducting ground state by varying the disorder level may be found in si section viii .",
    "we first demonstrate that na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 displays the 2-step transition outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the superconducting transitions in @xmath27 for a typical na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 single crystal with @xmath28  2.7  k. na vacancy disorder will reduce the coherence length @xmath29 and hence the energy barrier to topological defect formation  @xcite in the 1d regime ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we therefore anticipate an important contribution to @xmath27 from thermally - activated phase slips ( taps ) along individual ( mo@xmath1se@xmath1)@xmath18 nanowires within this temperature range .",
    "to model our data , we adapt the well - known langer - ambegaokar - mccumber - halperin ( lamh ) taps model to describe an array of superconducting nanowires and proceed to fit the @xmath27 superconducting transitions ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . a detailed discussion of the lamh model may be found in si section iiib , c . directly below @xmath11",
    ", our model accurately reproduces @xmath27 independently of the excitation @xmath31 : this indicates a universal onset of fluctuating 1d superconductivity . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 is the first bulk q1d superconductor to be accurately described by any 1d phase slip theory .",
    "however , 1d lamh theory can only describe our data over a finite temperature range @xmath32  0.4  k. as the temperature is reduced further , an anomaly appears in each @xmath27 curve whose position is displaced to lower temperature as @xmath31 increases . for @xmath33",
    "ma , the lamh regime in @xmath27 is terminated by a sharp peak : this corresponds to a suppression of single - particle tunnelling between phase - incoherent superconducting filaments , followed by the onset of phase coherence ( _ i.e. _ inter - chain cooper pair tunnelling ) at lower temperature .",
    "@xmath27 subsequently forms a finite - resistance plateau instead of falling to zero , which we attribute to isolated barriers such as micro - cracks and twin boundaries separating macroscopic phase - coherent superconducting regions ( si sections iiid , viii ) .",
    "eventually @xmath27 rises again as @xmath34 : this is the first experimental signature of reentrance .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath35  ma the resistance begins to diverge from the lamh model around @xmath36  k but continues to fall without forming a plateau , and eventually saturates with no upturn in the @xmath34 limit .",
    "the sharp peak is smeared into a broad hump ( fig .",
    "s3 ) , which we attribute to pair - breaking effects from the increased current . together",
    ", these features indicate the emergence of a phase - coherent q3d superconducting state composed of coupled 1d filaments .",
    "our electronic structure calculations predict that a 1d@xmath14q3d dimensional crossover for two - particle hopping ( _ i.e. _ josephson coupling ) should occur at temperature @xmath23  1.0  k",
    "( si section i ) .",
    "however , the anomaly in the @xmath27 data and the deviation from lamh fits suggest that transverse coupling develops at higher temperature 1.4  k  @xmath37  2.0  k. this increase in @xmath38 relative to our theoretical expectations may be attributed to two factors : firstly , any defects ( including na vacancies ) strongly reduce the effective @xmath9 due to the ease of blocking electron motion along a single ( mo@xmath1se@xmath1)@xmath18 filament .",
    "although it may initially seem counter - intuitive for inter - chain defects to influence intra - chain transport , each na vacancy not only removes one electron from the conduction band ( which is predominantly of mo @xmath20 character ) , but also locally modifies the crystal field . in such intensely anisotropic materials , even minor crystal field inhomogeneities",
    "can lead to an enhanced back - scattering at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "secondly , @xmath38 is believed to be enhanced to higher temperatures by increasingly strong electron - electron interactions  @xcite , although the behavior of q1d electron liquids below the single - particle dimensional crossover temperature ( @xmath39  120  k in na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 ) remains to be completely understood .",
    "interestingly , our experimental @xmath27 and voltage - current @xmath40 data share all the features of the well - known berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition , which establishes long - range order in 2d materials .",
    "this suggests that an exponential divergence in the transverse phase correlation length occurs close to @xmath38 in q1d materials .",
    "the similarity between 2d systems exhibiting bkt transitions and q1d superconductors becomes apparent upon considering the phase of the order parameter on each 1d filament ( fig .",
    "s4(a ) ) . in the plane",
    "perpendicular to the filaments , the spatial variation of the phase satisfies 2d  @xmath41 symmetry .",
    "however , the validity of bkt physics in q1d materials is neither obvious nor trivial , since it would imply that phase fluctuations parallel to the filaments do not influence the onset of transverse phase coherence .",
    "nevertheless , a bkt - type analysis ( si section iiie ) of our transport data yields @xmath42  1.71  k , in good agreement with the anomalies which we observe in our @xmath27 data .    combining our lamh fitting parameters and @xmath38 enables us to estimate a typical filament diameter @xmath32  0.4 - 0.7  nm ( si section iv ) .",
    "this corresponds closely to the ( mo@xmath1se@xmath1)@xmath18 chain diameter of 0.60  nm and the hexagonal lattice parameter @xmath43  0.86  nm , indicating that single ( mo@xmath1se@xmath1)@xmath18 chains behave as 1d superconducting nanowires .",
    "our analysis also indicates that current flows inhomogeneously through na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 and is supported by simulations of a disordered q1d conductor with an anisotropic random resistor network ( si section v ) .",
    "we attribute the inhomogeneous flow to the enhanced influence of disorder in 1d materials : above @xmath38 , defects ( e.g. na vacancies ) restrict transport along individual ( mo@xmath1se@xmath1)@xmath18 chains , forcing the current to follow a highly percolative route .      aside from the 2-step 1d  @xmath14  q3d transition , the major feature of interest in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the rise in resistance as @xmath44 for @xmath33  ma .",
    "this reversion to a fluctuation - dominated state suggests that the transverse phase coherence is fragile and reentrant .",
    "we track the evolution of the reentrance with current in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , where three important trends may be identified .",
    "firstly , the superconducting transition is conventionally suppressed to lower temperature as @xmath31 increases .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of the critical current @xmath45 does not follow the standard bardeen relation derived for bulk superconductors  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) inset ) , remaining unusually large at high temperature .",
    "secondly , for @xmath46  k the resistance falls as @xmath31 rises .",
    "this indicates that elevated currents induce reentrant phase coherence even in the @xmath34 limit .",
    "thirdly , the resistance rises ( signalling a loss of phase coherence ) upon reducing the temperature for @xmath33  ma .",
    "long range superconducting order is therefore only stable within a well - defined region of non - zero @xmath47 phase space .    to determine whether the phase coherence is also reentrant in magnetic fields",
    ", we measure the magnetotransport perpendicular and parallel to the @xmath19 axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b - e ) ) . a clear dichotomy is observed between data acquired using low ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b , d ) ) and high ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](c , e ) ) currents .",
    "the @xmath27 transitions in @xmath48  0.6  ma resemble those of a conventional superconductor ( albeit substantially broadened ) and no trace of reentrance is visible . in this case",
    ", transverse phase coherence has already been stabilized by the large current and hence the magnetic field exhibits a purely destructive effect on superconductivity .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath49  1  @xmath50a , @xmath27 rises at low temperature , indicating field - induced reentrance . for @xmath51  0.75  t",
    ", @xmath27 falls again below @xmath52  0.5  k , indicating double - reentrant behavior  @xcite .",
    "crucially , both phase coherence and double - reentrance are absent as @xmath34 in our zero - field data acquired at low current .",
    "this implies that a sequence of superconducting fluctuations , suppression of quasiparticle tunnelling and eventual macroscopic phase coherence ( which has been suggested to create `` double dips '' in @xmath53 in other inhomogeneous superconductors  @xcite ) can not be responsible for these data . instead",
    ", the double - reentrance may be a signature of a divergent @xmath5 caused by mesoscopic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "regardless of the applied current , the magnetotransport varies strongly with the field orientation , as expected for a q1d superconductor .",
    "we quantify this anisotropy _ via _ the temperature dependence of the upper critical fields @xmath54 , which we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3](f ) . using the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) model to estimate @xmath55 and subsequently applying anisotropic gl theory ( si section vi ) , we extract coherence lengths 14.4  nm  @xmath56  21.0  nm , 4.28  nm  @xmath57  4.58  nm and an anisotropy @xmath58 of 3.14  @xmath59  4.90 .",
    "this value is lower than the 12.6 reported for tl@xmath21mo@xmath1se@xmath1  @xcite , in spite of the increased electronic anisotropy : @xmath60  86 for na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 , _ versus _",
    "31 for tl@xmath21mo@xmath1se@xmath1 .",
    "two factors are responsible for this : firstly , disorder from the high na vacancy density strongly suppresses @xmath61 and hence @xmath62 .",
    "this is exposed by the orbitally - limited values for @xmath63 in tl@xmath21mo@xmath1se@xmath1 and in@xmath21mo@xmath1se@xmath1 : 0.47  t and 0.25  t respectively  @xcite , an order of magnitude lower than the 3.7 - 5  t measured for na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 .",
    "[ note that this reduction in @xmath62 also supports the previously - discussed enhancement of @xmath38 above @xmath64  1.0  k. ] secondly , our estimated @xmath65  16 - 18  t exceeds the weak - coupling bcs pauli limit @xmath66  5.0  t. this means that paramagnetic rather than orbital limiting is likely to suppress superconductivity for @xmath67 and hence gl theory may only provide an upper limit for @xmath68 .",
    "a striking divergence of @xmath27 is observed at low current for @xmath69  k and @xmath70  t ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) ) .",
    "this is a signature of magnetic field - induced anderson localization , predicted to occur in q1d materials when a field is applied perpendicular to the high - conductivity axis  @xcite . in the normal state ,",
    "the conditions for localization are @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is the cyclotron frequency @xmath74 ) .",
    "since electrons are paired for @xmath75 , josephson tunnelling supplants single - particle hopping as the transverse coupling mechanism and we replace @xmath8 in the above conditions with @xmath76 .",
    "cooper pair localization is therefore expected for @xmath77  1.3  t and @xmath78  1.7  k , in good agreement with our data . the resistance does not diverge for high currents ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](e ) ) due to the pair - breaking effect of the increased current : in this case , field - induced localization is only expected for @xmath79  t.      the reentrance visible within our @xmath27 data in figs .",
    "[ fig2],[fig3 ] may be summarized by independently scanning @xmath27 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ) . in the superconducting phase of na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1",
    ", @xmath82 is always minimized at non - zero @xmath22 : this is in direct contrast to the behavior of a conventional bulk superconductor , where phase fluctuations in @xmath82 are invariably minimized as @xmath83 .",
    "we highlight the fact that the @xmath84 and @xmath81 curves were acquired at @xmath85  k , thus confirming that transverse phase coherence is reentrant even as @xmath34 for sufficiently large magnetic fields or currents .",
    "we also note that the magnetoresistance ( mr ) is initially positive for @xmath80 , before falling steeply to its minimum value as transverse coupling is established .",
    "conversely , quasiparticle tunnelling contributions to the transport would be expected to yield a gradual , monotonic negative mr prior to reentrance at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "the absence of such a feature from our data provides further evidence that quasiparticle tunnelling does not play a major role in the reentrant behavior of na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 .",
    "we map the extent of phase coherence in na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 by assembling our experimental data into a single phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) . @xmath86 and @xmath45 ( circles ) from figs .",
    "2,3 accurately describe the evolution of the superconducting transition , but do not capture the loss of phase coherence at lower temperature .",
    "to track this loss of coherence , we therefore define a `` reentrance threshold '' temperature @xmath87 ( stars ) using the minima in @xmath88 from figs .",
    "@xmath89 varies from zero to 1.6  k , illustrating how the reentrant regime spans a broad temperature range as @xmath90 are tuned . at temperatures below @xmath87 , neighboring filaments are phase - incoherent and na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 exhibits the finite resistance characteristic of a fluctuating 1d superconductor .",
    "the volume enclosed by @xmath86 , @xmath45 and @xmath87 in @xmath22 phase space hence contains a reentrant `` shell '' of phase - coherent superconductivity ( dark red shading in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) , which surrounds a phase - incoherent regime as @xmath83 ( pink shading in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) .",
    "even if two of @xmath22 fall to zero , reentrance can still occur if the third parameter is sufficiently large : for example , phase coherence is still reentrant as @xmath91 above a threshold @xmath92  ma .      in an inhomogeneous superconductor , reentrance may occur if the josephson energy @xmath93 rises with respect to the thermal energy @xmath94 ( or the coulomb energy @xmath95 in granular materials )  @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 is a measure of the phase stiffness ( and hence the coupling strength ) between neighboring superconducting regions : microscopically , @xmath3 is proportional to the spatial overlap of the cooper pair wavefunctions from each region .",
    "a rise in @xmath3 increases the energy cost of creating phase discrepancies , hence facilitating cooper pair ( josephson ) tunnelling between the regions .",
    "once @xmath3 exceeds a threshold value of the order of @xmath96 , global phase coherence is established .",
    "previous experimental observations of reentrance attributed to josephson effects have generally occurred in amorphous , ultra - thin or granular films  @xcite .",
    "na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 is not an inhomogeneous or granular superconductor in the traditional sense , where phase coherence is determined by the ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath95 for individual grains  @xcite .",
    "instead , it is a crystalline superconductor whose normal state is a localized metal , due to the combination of na vacancy disorder and intense 1d anisotropy .",
    "signatures of localization are clearly visible in the normal - state resistance @xmath97 , which diverges as @xmath44 and displays a large negative magnetoresistance ( fig .",
    "localization causes electronic states which lie close in energy to become widely separated in space  @xcite , leading to a characteristic activation energy  @xcite @xmath98 .",
    "although we deduce the presence of localization from the normal - state transport , its influence persists within the superconducting phase , where pairing occurs between localized electrons ( provided that @xmath61 remains shorter than the localization length  @xcite ) . as the temperature falls , the electron wavefunctions become increasingly localized and the inter - filamentary pair hopping energy begins to fall below the @xmath12 limit imposed by the electronic anisotropy .",
    "this implies a progressive reduction in the wavefunction overlap between neighbouring filaments : localization is suppressing the transverse coupling and hence @xmath3 .",
    "eventually , @xmath93 falls below the threshold for phase coherence @xmath99 at @xmath100 .",
    "the influence of localization is accentuated by an emergent spatial inhomogeneity in the superconducting order parameter  @xcite which may locally suppress pairing , leading to further reductions in @xmath3 . to achieve reentrant phase coherence ,",
    "it is necessary to increase @xmath3 by delocalising the electrons . in principle , this may be achieved by thermal activation ( raising @xmath101 ) , reducing the barrier height between localized states ( raising @xmath31 ) or zeeman - splitting localized energy levels  @xcite ( raising @xmath102 ) .",
    "let us now attempt to model the effects of localization on the transverse phase coherence .",
    "the @xmath22 evolution of the inter - filamentary pair hopping energy can not be determined experimentally : even if the transverse resistance @xmath103 could be accurately measured ( an extremely challenging task due to the crystal morphology , anisotropy and disorder ) , it would contain inseparable contributions from single - particle and pair hopping , and fall to zero ( depriving us of information ) upon establishing phase coherence . instead , we estimate the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath3 within an analytical framework originally proposed by belevtsev _",
    "et al . _ for inhomogeneous superconductors  @xcite : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the resistance between superconducting filaments and @xmath106 is the pairing energy . for reentrant superconductivity , a peak is expected to form in @xmath3 at finite @xmath22 .",
    "since @xmath107 falls monotonically to zero as @xmath22 increase , a peak in @xmath3 at non - zero @xmath22 can only develop if the drop in @xmath107 is initially compensated by a larger reduction in @xmath105 ( see fig .",

    "was originally derived , the origins of this reduction are well understood .",
    "energy levels in individual grains are quantized , creating an activation energy for electron transfer : @xmath105 therefore falls exponentially as @xmath101 rises .",
    "increasing @xmath31 also reduces @xmath105 , since the associated increase in voltage diminishes the effective barrier height between grains .",
    "if @xmath105 furthermore exhibits negative magnetoresistance , then reentrance may occur upon raising @xmath101 , @xmath102 or @xmath31 . applying a similar scenario in na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 ,",
    "we extract @xmath98 from @xmath108 and treat this term analogously to the granular activation energy discussed above .",
    "we do not consider any coulomb contribution to the reentrance , since na@xmath0mo@xmath1se@xmath1 is crystalline and @xmath109 does not obey the efros - shklovskii hopping law  @xcite indicative of strong coulomb repulsion . using a similar current dependence for the inter - filamentary electron transfer rate to that in granular superconductors",
    "( see si section vii ) , we may then utilize the framework of equation  [ eq1 ] to estimate the evolution of @xmath93 .",
