    "however , the fundamental question as to the relevance of the related spin @xcite , charge @xcite or orbital @xcite fluctuations remains open .",
    "in fact , it is rather difficult to derive the dynamics and momentum dependence of the critical fluctuations with finite characteristic wavelengths @xcite and to identify which of the ordering phenomena drives the instabilities .",
    "raman scattering provides experimental access to all types of dynamic nematicity but only the charge sector has been studied in more detail @xcite . however , also in the case of spin - driven nematic order the technique can play a prominent role for coupling to a two - spin operator whereas a four - spin correlation function is the lowest order contribution to the neutron cross section @xcite .",
    "we exploit this advantage here and study the low - energy raman response of @xmath0 experimentally and interpret the results in terms of a microscopic model for a spin - driven nematic phase .",
    "in addition to the temperature dependence @xcite we address the spectral shape and the selection rules enabling us to explain the structural and magnetic transitions in a unified microscopic picture .",
    "we study @xmath0 single crystals having @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 as a function of photon polarization in the temperature range @xmath13k . for the symmetry assignment we use the 1fe unit cell making the fluctuations to appear in @xmath2 symmetry .",

    "in contrast , for ferro - orbital ordering with @xmath51 as found in fese @xcite the fluctuation response would appear in all symmetries .",
    "however , the lowest - order diagrams alone can only account for the spectral shape whereas the variation of the intensity around @xmath4 remains unexplained .",

    "we argue @xcite that @xmath70 and , according to eq .  , the raman amplitude is smaller than in the disordered ( tetragonal ) state but different from zero .",
    "this explains the continuous reduction of the raman response of spin fluctuations upon entering the nematic state .",

[ fig:2.5al ] to fit the data , whereas the intensity is dominated by the prefactor @xmath62 .",
    "since the theoretical model is valid only in the limit of small frequencies we argue that the initial slope reflects the temperature dependence of the intensity and is proportional to @xmath61 , at least close to the transition . for generally reflecting the spectral shape above @xmath7 ( eq .

    "this result shows that @xmath131 is the leading order .",
    "we note that @xmath131 predicts a stronger mixing of the particle - hole response from the electron and hole bands than @xmath130 as already outlined by mazin _",
    "the fluctuation response is superposed on the particle - hole continuum that essentially reflects symmetry - resolved transport properties @xcite .",
    "since the contribution of the fluctuations is relatively strong here they can be isolated with little uncertainty .",
    "the simplest way is to use the continuum at or slightly above the crossover temperature @xmath41 and subtract it from all spectra measured below @xmath41 .",
    "this was sufficient for erte@xmath135 @xcite but created negative intensities in the case of @xmath136 @xcite . here",
    ", we wish to compare the temperature dependence of the fluctuations to a theoretical prediction and have to improve on the subtraction of the continuum . to this end",
    "we make the analytical phenomenology for the @xmath2 continuum temperature dependent in a way that yields @xmath137 .",
    "this seems sensible since the proportionality holds for the @xmath14 results in the entire temperature range above @xmath7 and for the @xmath2 spectra above @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : synthetic_e - h ] shows the steps and checks necessary for the procedure .",
    "the analytical function used reads @xmath138 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\tilde\\gamma_0(t)}\\right ) + \\nonumber\\\\    & & [ \\beta_1+\\beta_2\\cdot t]\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\tilde\\gamma_0(t)}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which obeys @xmath139 as required by causality .",
    "@xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 depend only on doping @xmath32 .",
    "for @xmath11 we used @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 .",
    "@xmath148 is a fitting parameter that is selected in a way that the inverse slope @xmath149 of @xmath150 follows the resistivity ( orange diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig : synthetic_e - h]d ) .",
    "if a constant continuum is used the fluctuations can be isolated in a qualitatively similar fashion",
    ". however , the experimental data in fig .  2 vary more slowly close to @xmath4 .    below @xmath4",
    "the uncertainties increase since surface layers accumulate rapidly in the presence of twin boundaries where the surface assumes a more polar character .",
    "this can be seen directly in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - spot](c ) .",
    "( @xmath11 ) below @xmath41 .",
    "this figure is a reproduction of fig .",
    "[ fig:2.5al ] with the fluctuation response divided by the energy @xmath55 plotted against a logarithmic energy scale . ]    for being a causal function the raman response is antisymmetric and , as long as there is no gap , linear around the origin .",
    "then eq .   can be approximated as @xmath151 the temperature dependence ( not the magnitude ) of the initial slope can then directly be read off a graph if the response is divided by the energy @xmath55 and plotted against a logarithmic energy scale .",
    "if @xmath28 was known @xmath152 could be determined directly . with @xmath28 unknown",
    "only the relative change can be derived in this way .",
    "[ fig : r0/w ] shows that the fits reproduce the overall data rather well at low energy .",
    "the phenomenological curves can be extended to arbitrarily low energies providing a simple way to directly visualize the temperature dependence of @xmath152 .",
    "[ fig : r0/w ] shows also that the experimental data close to zero energy are not very stable .",
    "this problem arises from accumulating surface layers and the influence of the laser line .",
    "therefore , the error bars become excessively large if the slope is directly extracted from the data .",
    "here we use a wide spectral range to improve the reproducibility .",
