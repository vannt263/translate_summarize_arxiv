    "triply periodic minimal surfaces are objects of great interest to physical scientists , biologists , and mathematicians . a minimal surface , such as a soap film , is one that is locally area - minimizing .",
    "minimal surfaces are defined as surfaces with zero mean curvature .",
    "a remarkable class of minimal surfaces are those that are triply periodic ( i.e. , periodic in three directions ) .",
    "a triply periodic minimal surface is infinitely extending , has one of the crystallographic space groups as its symmetry group and , if it has no self - intersections , it partitions space into two disjoint but intertwining regions that are simultaneously continuous @xcite .",
    "if one thinks of each of these disjoint regions as the phase of a composite , then those two - phase composites in which the interface is a triply periodic minimal surface are a special class of bicontinuous two - phase composites .",
    "the schwartz primitive ( p ) , the schwartz diamond ( d ) and the schoen gyroid ( g ) minimal surfaces partition space into two disjoint but congruent regions , i.e. , the volume fraction of each phase is @xmath1 ( see fig .  [ fig : tpms ] ) .",
    "triply periodic minimal surfaces arise in a variety of systems , including block copolymers @xcite , nanocomposites @xcite , micellar materials @xcite , and lipid - water systems and certain cell membranes @xcite .",
    "= 2.1 in = 2.1 in = 2.1 in    one of us has very recently shown that triply periodic two - phase bicontinuous composites with interfaces that are the schwartz p and d minimal surfaces are not only geometrically extremal but extremal for simultaneous transport of heat and electricity @xcite .",
    "more precisely , these are the optimal structures when a weighted sum of the effective thermal and electrical conductivities is maximized for the case in which phase 1 is a good thermal conductor but poor electrical conductor and phase 2 is a poor thermal conductor but good electrical conductor .",
    "the demand that this sum is maximized sets up a _ competition _ between the two effective transport properties , and this demand is met by the schwartz p and d structures .",
    "we note that for reasons of mathematical analogy , the optimality of these bicontinuous composites applies to any of the pair of the following scalar effective properties : electrical conductivity , thermal conductivity , dielectric constant , magnetic permeability , and diffusion coefficient .",
    "since triply periodic minimal surfaces arise in certain cell membranes , it stands to reason that such structures must also be relatively stiff elastically in order to withstand mechanical loads .",
    "the topological property of bicontinuity of these structures suggests that they would be mechanically stiff even if one of the phases is a compliant solid or a liquid , provided that the other phase is a relatively stiff material .",
    "motivated by this biological example , torquato and donev @xcite asked what are the two - phase composite structures that maximize a weighted sum of the dimensionless effective bulk modulus and effective electrical ( or thermal ) conductivity .",
    "thus , they set up a competition between a mechanical property and a transport property .",
    "they demonstrated that triply periodic two - phase bicontinuous composites with interfaces that are the schwartz p and d minimal surfaces are again optimal , further establishing the multifunctionality of such two - phase systems .",
    "based on the aforementioned considerations , it is reasonable to inquire whether the minimal surfaces are optimal for other effective properties , such as flow characteristics .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study stokes ( slow viscous ) flow through triply porous media whose interfaces are the schwartz p , the schwartz d , and the schoen g minimal surfaces . in particular , we are interested in computing the fluid permeability @xmath2 , which is the key macroscopic property for describing stokes flow through porous media @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 is the proportionality constant between the average fluid velocity and applied pressure gradient in the porous medium as defined by darcy s law : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the average fluid velocity , @xmath5 is the applied pressure gradient and @xmath6 is the dynamic viscosity .",
    "our expectation is that the schwartz p porous medium will have the highest fluid permeability among the three minimal surfaces because it has the smallest _ specific surface _",
    "( i.e. , interface area per unit volume ) .",
    "surface area alone of course does not necessarily inversely correlate with fluid permeability @xcite .",
    "we will show that the schwartz p porous medium does indeed have the highest fluid permeability among the three minimal surfaces . a natural question to ask",
    "is whether the fluid permeability of the schwartz p porous medium is maximal in any sense .",
    "although we do not answer this challenging question here , we also compute fluid permeabilities for other triply periodic geometries , such as flow over spheres arranged on the sites of a simple lattice and flow inside two different pore - channel models at a porosity ( volume fraction of pore space ) @xmath7 .",
    "we find that the schwartz p porous medium has the highest fluid permeability among all of the six triply periodic porous media considered in this paper .",
    "we demonstrate that the fluid permeabilities are inversely proportional to the corresponding specific surfaces for these structures .",
    "this leads to the reasonable conjecture that the maximal fluid permeability ( scaled by the cell length squared ) for a triply periodic porous medium with a simply connected pore space at a porosity @xmath0 is achieved by the structure that globally minimizes the specific surface .    due to the numerical difficulties in generating complex meshes of various minimal surfaces ,",
    "the immersed body finite volume method was adopted in this paper @xcite .",
    "momentum forcing is applied on the body surface or inside the body to satisfy the no - slip boundary condition on the immersed boundary and also to satisfy the continuity for the each control volume element containing the immersed body .",
    "this procedure is based on a finite - volume approach on a staggered mesh with a fractional step method .",
    "the unit domain is chosen to be a cube and is digitized into small cubic subvolumes .    in section [ section2 ] , we review some procedures to represent triply periodic minimal surfaces . in section [ section3 ] , the immersed - boundary finite volume method for flow through triply periodic porous media is described . in section [ section4 ] , we verify the accuracy of our numerical methods by computing the fluid permeability for flow over spheres arranged on the sites of a simple cubic and compare them to corresponding analytical / numerical results of sangani and acrivos @xcite . here",
    "we also present our evaluations of the fluid permeabilities for other triply periodic porous media , including schwartz p and d surfaces and the schoen g surface and two different pore - channel models .",
    "concluding remarks and a discussion are given in section [ section5 ] .",
    "triply periodic minimal surfaces can be characterized exactly using an enneper - weierstrass ( complex integration ) representation only for several cases . for schwartz p and d and schoen g ,",
    "analytic surfaces are constructed in terms of elliptic functions by the enneper - weierstrass representation @xcite , but in practice this is difficult to use numerically .",
    "recently , it was shown that triply periodic minimal surfaces can be generated as the local minima of the scalar order parameter landau - ginzburg functional for describing ordering phenomena in microemulsion @xcite .",
    "this landau - ginzburg free - energy functional @xcite can be utilized to calculate numerically a discretization of a potential @xmath8 such that @xmath9 for points in phase 1 and @xmath10 for points in phase 2 . at the phase interface , @xmath11 , which in this case is a schwartz p , d or schoen g minimal surface",
    "moreover , the minimal surfaces can be approximated by the periodic nodal surface ( pns ) of a sum defined in terms of the fourier series @xcite , because any periodic surface can be expressed as the sum of an infinite number fourier terms .    in this paper , the schwartz p and d and the schoen g surfaces are produced by both the landau - ginzburg minimization @xcite and pns approximations with a few fourier terms @xcite on a @xmath12 unit cell .",
    "> from these potentials , one can readily make discretizations of triply periodic bicontinuous two - phase composites in which the two - phase interface is a minimal surface .",
    "because phase 1 is topologically and geometrically identical to phase 2 , either phase can be chosen to be the fluid phase . indeed",
    ", triply periodic minimal surfaces have the special property that the fluid permeability of phase 1 is equal to the fluid permeability of phase 2 .",
    "such phase interchange relations are rare in the case of the fluid permeability .",
    "by contrast , phase interchange relations in the case of the effective conductivity and effective elastic moduli of two - phase composites have been known for a long time ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we then used an immersed boundary finite - volume method ( described below ) to calculate numerically the fluid permeabilities of these composites .",
    "we consider the flow field in an infinite porous medium .",
    "the navier - stokes equations are nondimensionalized with @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the time , @xmath6 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath16 is the density , @xmath17 is the characteristic length , @xmath18 is the pressure , @xmath19 is the pressure at a reference , @xmath20 is the characteristic speed .",
    "dropping the primes leads to the dimensionless navier - stokes equations @xmath21 where @xmath15 is the dimensionless time , @xmath22 s are the dimensionless cartesian coordinates ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 s are the corresponding dimensionless velocity components , @xmath18 is the dimensionless pressure and @xmath26 is the reynolds number @xcite .",
    "= 5.5 in    in the limit @xmath27 , we obtain the dimensionless unsteady stokes flow equations , which is of central concern in this study .",
    "these unsteady stokes equations recover the steady stokes formulation for infinite time advancement . due to the numerical difficulties in generating complex meshes of various minimal surfaces ,",
    "the immersed boundary finite volume method was adopted in this paper @xcite .",
    "the discrete - time momentum forcing , @xmath28 , is applied to satisfy the no - slip condition on the immersed boundary .",
    "the forcing points are located in a staggered fashion like the velocity components defined on a staggered grid ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stagger ] ) .",
    "therefore , the governing equations for unsteady incompressible stokes flow becomes @xmath29 where @xmath28 s are the dimensionless momentum forcing components defined at the cell faces on the immersed boundary and inside the body .",
    "the stokes equations represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : stokes ] ) are advanced with a fully implicit , fractional step method @xcite with the crank - nicholson method in convection term .",
    "the fractional step , or time - split method , approximates the evolution equation by decomposition of the operators in it .",
    "a four - step time advancement @xcite is modified for time integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : stokes ] ) as follows : @xmath30 here , the solution @xmath31 at time step @xmath32 is advanced to @xmath33 at time step @xmath34 through intermediate velocities @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "explicit direct forcing scheme for the momentum equation is utilized to obtain the momentum forcing value in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolv ] ) which should be known _ a priori _ for time advancement @xcite . discretizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolv ] ) explicitly in time and rearranging it for @xmath37 at a forcing point results in @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the velocity imposed at forcing point to enforce @xmath40 on the immersed boundary . to satisfy the no - slip boundary condition on the immersed boundary , @xmath39 is zero when the forcing point is at the immersed boundary or inside the body .",
    "all the spatial derivatives are resolved with the second - order central - difference scheme using a staggered mesh system .",
    "the discretized momentum equations are factorized into three operators which requires inversion of tridiagonal matrices .",
    "time advancement is achieved by sweeping @xmath41- , @xmath42- , and @xmath43-direction tridiagonal matrix algorithm at time intervals of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath34 .    to drive flow in a unit cell of a triply periodic porous medium",
    ", a pressure drop is applied from the inlet to the outlet of the channel in one of the three directions ( @xmath41 in this paper ) . in the other two directions (",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , standard treatment for velocity and pressure periodic boundary conditions are applied . to solve the elliptic pressure eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson ] ) , the alternating direction implicit ( adi ) method is applied with a relaxation .",
    "non - uniqueness of a pressure solution due to applying a pressure drop condition can be resolved with a point constraint which imposes an arbitrary pressure value at an arbitrary position .",
    "in fact , the pressure gradient only is necessary to solve for velocity field . when the triply periodic surface possesses simple cubic symmetry , the periodic boundary conditions can be exploited further .",
    "because of the mirror image of the flow and pressure field across @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the unit size channel simulation , the simple cubic symmetry motivates setting the velocity and pressure at the reflection position across the middle cross - section .    in general , the forcing point of an arbitrary immersed body",
    "does not coincide with the immersed boundary , but rather inside the body in the non - body fitted cartesian mesh .",
    "this requires a velocity interpolation to impose the correct @xmath39 at a forcing point .",
    "however , no velocity interpolation scheme is necessary to satisfy the no - slip boundary condition on the immersed boundary in this paper because in the digitized triply periodic surfaces the forcing point of an immersed body always coincides with the immersed boundary .",
    "in this section , we will apply the immersed boundary method to determine stokes flow velocity fields in triply periodic porous media with cubic symmetry .",
    "we begin by computing the flow field for a periodic array of spheres in order to validate the procedure and the numerical results .",
    "subsequently , we apply the numerical procedure to two different pore - channel models as well as the bicontinuous structures with interfaces that are the schwartz p and d minimal surfaces and the schoen g minimal surfaces . the permeability results for all six cases",
    "are compared at the porosity @xmath7 .",
    "the fluid permeabilities are obtained from the imposed pressure drop @xmath48 and average velocity @xmath4 of the flow field in the cubic periodic cell of side length @xmath17 .",
    "because of the cubic symmetry , the second - order fluid permeability tensor is isotropic ( i.e. , it is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the identity tensor)@xcite , and therefore the determination of the permeability along the @xmath41 axes is sufficient to characterize @xmath2 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : darcy ] ) , the fluid permeability @xmath2 can be made dimensionless by dividing it by @xmath51 .",
    "henceforth , all permeabilities will be reported in this dimensionless form .",
    "the computational domain is chosen to be a unit cube and staggered cartesian meshes were generated , depending on the required resolution .",
    "all initial velocities and pressures are set equal to zero .      to verify the numerical accuracy of the immersed boundary method",
    ", we compare our calculations to the analytical / numerical results of sangani and acrivos @xcite for flow past periodic arrays of spheres centered on the sites of a simple cubic lattice . the immersed body ( sphere in this case )",
    "is constructed using the following criterion .",
    "the immersed sphere is identified if the center of each voxel constituting a single sphere centered at ( @xmath52 ) satisfies the equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the radius of the sphere . as explained in section [ section3 ] , a pressure drop is applied in @xmath41 direction , and standard treatment for velocity periodic boundary conditions are applied in @xmath42 and @xmath43 direction .",
    "the fluid permeability @xmath2 obtained from numerical simulations are listed in table [ table:1 ] for various values of the scaled particle volume fraction @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the particle volume fraction and @xmath57 is the maximum particle volume fraction corresponding to the case when the spheres are in contact .",
    "our fluid permeability calculations are in good agreement with the results of sangani and acrivos @xcite .",
    "= 5.0 in    non - uniform ( stretching ) staggered meshing is used toward the body over the computational domain to get the required spatial accuracy for the immersed boundary method , which is important for comparison of our permeability data to corresponding analytical / numerical results over a smooth sphere ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mesh ] ) .",
    "the discretization of a continuous body with a finite resolution obviously affects the numerical accuracy of the computed fluid permeability @xmath2 , which depends on the value of the grid mesh spacing @xmath58 or the mesh resolution @xmath59 .",

    "the specific surface does not necessarily correlate with the permeability .",
    "however , the pore spaces of structures with large permeabilities are expected to be _ simply connected _ and therefore it would not be unreasonable for the permeability to be inversely proportional to the specific surface in these instances .    the determination of the structure that globally optimizes the fluid permeability is a highly challenging problem .",
