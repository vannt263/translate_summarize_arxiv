    "the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) was launched in 2003 and renamed the spitzer space telescope . following the in - orbit checkout",
    ", it began the first - look survey ( fls ) of selected areas to characterize the far - infrared ( fir ) sky two orders of magnitude deeper than was reached by previous instruments ( see http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/fls/ ) .",
    "the extragalactic portion of the fls covers about @xmath13 centered on j2000 @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "most of the extragalactic fir sources are expected to have radio continuum counterparts obeying the fir / radio correlation , so this region has been imaged by the vla with matching sensitivity at 1.4ghz @xcite . because there is a good correlation between galactic fir emission and the column density of hi at high galactic latitudes @xcite",
    ", high - quality 21 cm hi data from this region can be used to estimate foreground galactic cirrus emission which might confuse extragalactic studies .",
    "the hi data are also useful for studying properties of galactic dust seen in the fir ( e.g. , boulanger et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we have observed the area of the fls survey in the 21 cm line of hi with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "the data give accurate values of the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath9 throughout the field and reveal interesting interstellar structures , most of which are visible in existing fir data .",
    "we used the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) @xcite to measure the 21 cm hi emission over the fls field six times during three observing sessions in 2002 , 2003 , and 2004 .",
    "the gbt has a half - power beam width of @xmath16 in the 21 cm line at 1.420  ghz .",
    "the total system temperature toward the fls field was @xmath17k , and the receiver recorded both circular polarizations .",
    "for this experiment the telescope was scanned in right ascension at a constant declination , then the declination was stepped by @xmath18 and the scan direction was reversed .",
    "the resulting images cover an area of @xmath19 in right ascension and declination centered on j2000 @xmath1 , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) . within this area hi spectra",
    "were measured every 3  in both coordinates .",
    "the integration time was 3s per pixel for each of the six maps , and data were taken by frequency switching out of the band .",
    "the spectra cover about 520kms@xmath5 centered at @xmath23kms@xmath5 with a channel spacing of 0.52 km s@xmath5 and an effective velocity resolution of 0.62kms@xmath5 .",
    "the spectral brightness temperature scale was determined from laboratory measurements of the noise diode and checked with frequent observations of the standard regions s6 and s8 @xcite .",
    "we used aips++ to regrid and average the spectra into a single data cube with a pixel size of @xmath24 .",
    "third - degree polynomials were fit to line - free regions of the spectra and subtracted , and a correction for stray radiation was applied as described below , yielding a final data cube with the properties given in table 1 .",
    "the regridding broadened the effective angular resolution to a fwhm of @xmath4 .",
    "ideally , all signals received by a radio telescope would come through the main antenna beam .",
    "real telescopes , however , always have sidelobes .",
    "these sidelobes cause special problems for observations of galactic hi because there is galactic 21 cm hi emission from every direction on the sky .",
    "all telescope sidelobes not falling on the ground thus contribute `` stray '' radiation which must be subtracted if accurate hi spectra are to be obtained . unlike all other large antennas ,",
    "the gbt has an unblocked optical path and should have a minimum of stray hi radiation .",
    "however , the feed horn currently used for 21 cm observations is part of a general purpose l - band system covering 1.15ghz ",
    "1.73ghz from the gregorian focus .",
    "because of structural limitations on its size and weight , this feed over - illuminates the 8 m diameter secondary reflector at the 1.420ghz frequency of the 21 cm line , creating a broad and diffuse forward spillover lobe which contains about 4% of the telescope s response ( norrod & srikanth 1996 ; s.  srikanth , private communication ) .",
    "efforts are underway to model and measure this sidelobe .",
    "its importance for observations of the fls field is illustrated by figure 1 , which shows the striking difference between two gbt hi spectra of the same sky area observed at different local sidereal times ( lsts ) .",
    "the differences between the spectra are due entirely to changes in the stray radiation . in figure 2",
    ", the the two ovals show the gbt subreflector in galactic coordinates as seen from the focal point at the times the two observations were made .",
    "when the upper rim of the subreflector lies at low latitude , e.g. , at 23@xmath25 lst , the spillover lobe picks up the very bright hi emission from the galactic plane , whereas at 10@xmath25 lst the subreflector rim lies primarily on faint hi at high galactic latitude .",
    "the general characteristics of the profiles in figure 1 suggest that this understanding of the origin of the difference between the spectra is correct .",
    "the best way to compensate for stray radiation entering a telescope s sidelobes is to determine the telescope s response in all directions , estimate the contribution from hi in directions away from the main beam , and subtract that from the observed spectra .",
    "this method has been used successfully to correct data from several instruments @xcite , but it is quite laborious and requires knowledge of a telescope s sidelobes in directions where they are very weak . moreover ,",
    "it is not certain that developing this technique for the gbt will be worth the effort because , unlike conventional reflectors whose sidelobes are caused by aperture blockage which can never be eliminated , the strongest sidelobes of the gbt are consequences of the specific feed and are not at all fundamental .    for the immediate purposes of this work",
    ", we estimated the stray component in the fls field by `` bootstrapping '' the gbt data to the leiden - dwingeloo survey data in the general manner described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this method assumes that the stray component of a 21 cm spectrum , which typically arises from broad sidelobes , does not change significantly with changes in main - beam pointing of a few degrees , and is also approximately constant during the few hours it takes to make one map .",
    "each gbt map of the fls field was made over 3 hours , so it is plausible that over this period the stray radiation spectrum can be approximated by a single average profile .",
    "that profile can be determined by convolving the gbt hi image to the angular resolution of the leiden - dwingeloo ( hereafter ld ) survey , which was made by a 25 m telescope having 36  resolution @xcite and was corrected for stray radiation using an all - sky model of its response @xcite .",
    "any difference between the gbt data convolved to 36  resolution , and the ld survey spectra at the same position , can be attributed to stray radiation in the gbt data .",
    "we applied this technique to the gbt observations of the fls .",
    "the gbt data were convolved to the 36resolution of the ld survey and compared with ld observations in the central area of the fls field using a revised version of the ld survey with an improved stray - radiation correction kindly supplied by p. kalberla .",
    "the difference spectra have the expected characteristics of stray radiation given the location of the gbt spillover lobe on the sky at the times of the observations .",
    "there are two exceptions , however : ( 1 ) the high - velocity cloud at @xmath26kms@xmath5 and ( 2 ) the narrow , bright , spectral feature near @xmath27 which appears in many directions over the fls field .",
    "for both features the naive `` bootstrapping '' procedure gives inconsistent , implausibly large , and sometimes unphysically negative corrections to the gbt data .",
    "we believe that these problems are caused by limitations in the ld survey and its stray - radiation correction .",
    "the ld survey used its own data as the hi sky for determining stray - radiation corrections in an iterative procedure , but that hi sky was undersampled , being measured only every @xmath28 .",
    "thus real features near their main beam that have angular structure or velocity gradients on scales @xmath29 will be aliased into an erroneous stray - radiation correction .",
    "the potential for this sort of systematic effect was noted by the ld survey group @xcite , and we believe it occurs at velocities that have the greatest fractional variation in @xmath30 across the fls field : those of the high - velocity cloud and those of the bright , low - velocity , narrow lines .    in the bootstrapping technique that we adopted after much experimentation , a gbt hi image was convolved with a circular gaussian function to 36  angular resolution and compared to ld survey spectra at eight locations near the field center . because stray radiation is expected to be significant only at velocities @xmath31kms@xmath5 , the observed gbt data were taken to be correct at @xmath32kms@xmath5 . to compensate for the unphysical estimate of the stray radiation at the velocity of the narrow bright line",
    ", the stray spectrum was interpolated over the velocity range @xmath33kms@xmath5 which contains this feature .",
    "the stray column densities derived in this way vary from @xmath34@xmath7 for the data taken at lst 10@xmath25 to @xmath35@xmath7 for the data taken at 23@xmath25 . on the whole ,",
    "the correction procedure appears to produce consistent results for all six images when they are processed separately , so we averaged them to produce the final data cube .",
    "figure 3 shows the uncorrected 21 cm spectrum averaged over the central part of all the maps of the fls , and the average spectrum of the stray radiation which was subtracted from it , which has an equivalent @xmath36 @xmath7 .",
    "work is now underway on projects that we hope will eliminate the gbt s forward spillover lobe at 21 cm , greatly improving its performance for hi observations , and making procedures like this unnecessary in the future .",
    "we note that the forward spillover lobe is important only at frequencies 1  2 ghz . over most of its frequency range",
    "the gbt has an exceptionally clean antenna pattern .      for @xmath37 km s@xmath5 uncertainties in the final spectra",
    "are dominated by random noise , while for velocities closer to zero the uncertainties arise mainly from the correction for stray radiation .",
    "an estimate of the latter was derived by comparing data cubes that had quite different amounts of stray radiation removed .",
    "the comparison suggests that our correction for stray radiation may introduce an rms error of 0.1k for @xmath38 km s@xmath5 , and as much as 0.25k for the brighter emission near zero velocity . at the eight positions across the final image where the stray correction was derived , the integrated correction has a standard deviation equivalent to @xmath39@xmath7 , which should be a reasonable estimate for this error term .",
    "we checked for temporal variations in the stray correction by looking for systematic offsets in corrected spectra as a function of time , but found nothing significant .",
    "the rms instrumental noise @xmath40k was derived from fluctuations in emission - free channels and is in good agreement with theoretical estimates .",
    "table 2 summarizes these uncertainties .",
    "after correction for stray radiation , the spectra were converted from units of brightness temperature @xmath41 to hi column density per channel @xmath42 .",
    "this step requires knowledge of the excitation temperature ( called the spin temperature @xmath43 ) of the 21 cm transition , which usually can not be determined from the 21 cm emission spectra themselves @xcite .",
    "two conversions were therefore made : one assuming @xmath44k , which corresponds to optically thin emission , and the other for @xmath45k , a value appropriate for diffuse clouds @xcite and one which is more realistic for the narrow line at low velocity which must arise from gas with @xmath46 k ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "most of the hi emission has a @xmath41 of only a few kelvins , so the difference in assumed @xmath43 affects the total @xmath9 by only a few percent .",
    "however , at the velocities of the brightest lines , e.g. , around @xmath48 km s@xmath5 , @xmath49 can be as large as 1.2 . in all likelihood",
    ", @xmath43 varies across every 21 cm hi spectrum @xcite .",
    "uncertainty in the conversion of @xmath30 to @xmath9 affects the interpretation of dust - to - gas ratios in parts of the fls field (  4 ) .",
    "the fundamental data cube of @xmath50 is available for anyone who wishes to make a different conversion to @xmath42 .",
    "the final data product is three cubes , available via http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fls@xmath51gbt in fits format .",
    "data at the extreme ranges of velocity which contain no emission have been omitted from the final cubes .",
    "the data before correction for stray radiation are also available from f.  j.  lockman upon request .",
    "hi spectra from the fls field ( e.g. , fig .  3 ) typically contain four components : ( 1 ) a broad line near zero velocity which contains most of the emission in most directions , ( 2 ) a bright , narrow line also near zero velocity which has a patchy though spatially correlated structure , ( 3 ) several clouds at intermediate negative velocities , and ( 4 ) a high - velocity cloud .",
    "the high - velocity cloud appears over much of the fls field , particularly at the higher declinations .",
    "it has a strong velocity gradient from @xmath52kms@xmath5 in the east , where it is brightest , to @xmath53kms@xmath5 in the west .",
    "this is part of high - velocity complex c , a large sheet of gas which extends @xmath54 across the sky and is at least 5kpc distant @xcite .",
    "the hi column density integrated over the velocity of the cloud is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the peak @xmath9 of @xmath55@xmath7 is about one - quarter of the total @xmath9 in that direction .",
    "several hi clouds at an intermediate negative velocity are visible in the fls field ( figs .  5 and 6 ) .",
    "properties of these clouds are listed in table 3 .",
    "some are smaller than the gbt beam .",
    "they contribute 10%  25% to the total @xmath9 in their directions .",
    "unlike high - velocity clouds , which do not show fir emission @xcite , intermediate - velocity clouds are highly correlated with @xmath56 , though sometimes with a smaller @xmath57 ratio than quiescent gas @xcite .",
    "of special interest is the rather simple cloud shown in figure 6 , which seems to be part of the draco nebula , an object @xmath58pc distant .",
    "the draco nebula is quite distinct at @xmath59 m and is seen in absorption against the soft x - ray background @xcite .    finally , the integrated @xmath9 image of fig .",
    "7 shows an arc of emission to the south - west ( lower right ) which arises in a narrow line at @xmath48kms@xmath5 .",
    "the line - width of 2.7kms@xmath5 fwhm implies that the gas has a kinetic temperature @xmath60k .",
    "this is the brightest line in the field , reaching a peak @xmath61  k , corresponding to @xmath62 and @xmath63@xmath7 for @xmath64 k. most of the emission in the arc appears to be resolved by the beam of the gbt , though there may be small unresolved components .",
    "the hi column density for @xmath45k integrated over all velocities is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the visible structure is caused by specific interstellar objects , many of which have been discussed above .",
    "table 4 lists values of @xmath9 averaged over various areas centered on the fls central position . over 9deg@xmath0",
    "the total @xmath9 varies by only a factor of two , with an rms scatter 13% of the mean . as in most directions at high galactic latitude , structure in hi over the fls field",
    "is highly spatially correlated ; significant fluctuations in total @xmath9 do not arise randomly or from tiny clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite hereafter sfd , have derived the dust column density across the sky from temperature - corrected @xmath59 m data , and have expressed it as a reddening @xmath10 .",
    "figure 8 shows their values of @xmath10 over the fls field at full resolution .",
    "( the sfd maps have an angular resolution of @xmath65 , but quantitative comparisons with hi are made using the sfd maps smoothed to the angular resolution of the hi maps . )",
    "most dust features have exact counterparts in hi .",
    "the correlation is shown explicitly in the left panel of figure 9 , where the fir - derived reddening @xmath10 is plotted against @xmath9 .",
    "the hi spectra consist of many components , and correlations performed between @xmath10 and @xmath9 in various velocity intervals show that high - velocity complex c must have a @xmath59 m emissivity per hi atom at least an order of magnitude smaller than the other hi components . for complex c , the @xmath66 limit is @xmath67 mjy sr@xmath5 cm@xmath0 , while the ratio ranges between 50 and 70 in the same units for hi at other velocities in the fls field , values comparable to those found in other studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this confirms previous findings of only upper limits on @xmath56 from high - velocity clouds @xcite .",
    "complex c has low metallicity and contains little dust @xcite which can account for its low fir emissivity .",
    "the right panel of figure 9 shows the @xmath10 vs.  @xmath9 when hi associated with the high - velocity cloud is not included .",
    "the scatter is greatly reduced .    the lines in fig .",
    "9 are fit to @xmath69 k ) and the coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 are listed in table 5 .",
    "the lower panel of figure 8 shows @xmath9 for @xmath45 k without the high - velocity cloud .",
    "in contrast to the hi map of fig .  7 , which includes all hi , this @xmath9 map appears nearly identical to the dust map , though there remain interesting anomalous regions . a map of the ratio @xmath72 over the fls field is shown in figure 10 .",
    "the ratio varies between 0.9 and 1.5 with a mean of @xmath73 mag @xmath74 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the gas and dust in the fls field is beyond the scope of this paper , for there issues of dust properties and temperature , the conversion between @xmath75 and @xmath10 , and the dust associated with ionized gas @xcite . here",
    "we will consider only what can be learned from the hi about possible sources of the variation in @xmath11 across the fls field , for some variations in the ratio seem tied to the properties of the 21 cm line .",
    "a significant aspect of fig .",
    "10 is that spatial structure in the dust - to - gas ratio is highly correlated , a fact that has been known for some time ( e.g. , sfd ) . perhaps surprisingly , high dust - to - gas ratios come preferentially from areas of high @xmath9 .",
    "one can see in the right panel of fig .",
    "9 that high @xmath9 directions are redder than a strict linear relationship would suggest .",
    "table 5 includes results of a linear fit to only that data with @xmath76 , equivalent to @xmath77 @xmath7 ; the slope is significantly flatter than when all reddenings are included .",
    "but higher reddening per unit @xmath9 does not simply track areas of high @xmath9 : the greatest @xmath9 in the fls field is in the upper left , yet it has an average value of @xmath72 and is not at all conspicuous in fig .",
    "we find , instead , that the best predictor of a high @xmath72 over the fls field is the peak brightness temperature in the 21 cm line , as shown in figure 11 .",
    "there seems to be excess reddening when spectra have a peak @xmath78 k , and the discrepancy increases as the line gets brighter .",
    "the spectra with the highest @xmath30 are those toward the ` arc ' at @xmath79 .",
    "similar , and possibly related line components cover much of the map . assuming that the values of @xmath10 are accurate",
    ", we consider three possibilities which might explain the increased reddening in this component .",
    "first , the values of @xmath9 we derive would be underestimates if the gas in the brighter lines is cooler than the assumed @xmath80 .",
    "for example , if the brightest location in the ` arc ' is evaluated for @xmath81 k instead of 80 k , its derived @xmath9 would be increased enough to give it an average dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "this however , does not help other directions on the map very much : for @xmath82 k there still remain large correlated areas of high dust - to - gas ratio , and the standard deviation of the ratio across the map is reduced by only @xmath83 from the @xmath84 k values . adopting even lower values of @xmath85",
    "would create areas of below - average ratios in the map .",
    "we believe that the features of figs .  10 and 11 can not simply be the result of an incorrect @xmath85 .",
    "second , it is possible that @xmath9 does not reflect the total @xmath86 because some gas is in the form of h@xmath87 .",
    "while it has long been known that significant amounts of molecular hydrogen are seen in directions with total @xmath88@xmath7 @xcite , the total @xmath9 along most sight - lines is most likely an integration over gas of very different properties , diffuse and dense ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and h@xmath87 might be found in individual clouds at smaller values of @xmath9 . if the ` arc ' in the fls field has a line - of - sight size similar to its tranverse size , then it has an average hi density @xmath89 @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is its distance in hundreds of pc .",
    "although the distance to this gas is not known , it is almost certainly local , within a few hundred pc , and thus @xmath92 @xmath90 . at these densities , and for its @xmath93 @xmath7 , theoretical calculations show that it should have @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "this amount would be sufficient to account for the apparent excess of dust in the feature and in similar objects in the fls field . in this interpretation , the brightest hi",
    "lines are coming from the densest clouds , which have some molecules , an inference supported by other ir  hi correlations @xcite .",
    "finally , it is possible that the dust - to - gas ratio , or the character of the dust , or its infrared emission , really does vary as illustrated in fig .  10 , and that the connection to the hi spectrum peak @xmath95 simply identifies a particular interstellar cloud , and does not have physical significance .",
    "in this regard it is interesting that the mean dust - to - gas ratio in the fls field derived from the sfd reddening values implies that one magnitude of reddening requires an @xmath9 of @xmath96 @xmath7 , almost @xmath97 higher than the canonical value of @xmath98 @xmath7 @xcite , which resulted from direct observations in the ultraviolet and optical .",
    "in fact , if we adopt the @xcite relationship as the correct one , then the anomaly in the fls field is that there is too little dust except in the arc and related regions .",
    "the hi data presented here should be useful for estimating the effects of galactic foreground emission on the spitzer fls data .",
    "we find that for @xmath99 @xmath7 there is a linear relationship between @xmath10 derived from fir emission and @xmath9 , provided that high - velocity hi is omitted .",
    "directions where the 21 cm line has a peak brightness @xmath78 k show above - average reddening per unit @xmath9 and may contain some h@xmath87 .",
    "the correlation between excess dust per hi atom and peak @xmath41 , rather than with the total @xmath9 , may arise because a high @xmath41 can signify pileup of gas at a specific volume in space , and hence a high density and local shielding , whereas a high total @xmath9 can result from the sum of many unrelated , low density regions .",
    "comparison of the individual hi spectral components with infrared data from the spitzer fls may find variations in the fir emissivity of different spectral features , and possibly even reveal a component connected with the high - velocity cloud .",
