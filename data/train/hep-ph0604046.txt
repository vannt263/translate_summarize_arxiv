    "despite the impressive success of the standard model ( sm ) in describing a plethora of high - precision experimental data @xcite , a number of important theoretical issues related to its structure remain largely unexplored .",
    "perhaps the most prominent among them is the nature of the very mechanism which endows the elementary particles with their observed masses .",
    "the best established way for introducing masses at tree - level , without compromising renormalizability , is the higgs mechanism @xcite , where the crucial ingredient is the coupling of all would - be massive particles to a complex scalar field with a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value .",
    "the most characteristic physical remnant of this procedure is a massive scalar particle in the spectrum of the theory , the higgs boson .",
    "in addition to the minimal sm , the higgs mechanism is employed in many popular new physics scenaria , most notably in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and its variants @xcite , leading to yet richer scalar sectors . however , to date , neither the higgs boson of the minimal sm , nor the additional scalars predicted by its supersymmetric extensions have been observed , and their discovery and subsequent detailed study is considered as one of the main priorities for the upcoming collider experiments .",
    "several of the aforementioned scalars , and especially the `` standard '' higgs boson , are expected to be discovered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the past few years a significant amount of technical and theoretical research has been invested in the evaluation of the feasibility and physics potential of muon colliders @xcite .",
    "such machines will have the particularly appealing feature of variable centre - of - mass energy , which will allow the resonant enhancement of @xmath2-channel interactions in order to produce higgs bosons copiously .",
    "thus , muon colliders are expected to operate as higgs factories , in the energy range of up to .5 tev .",
    "given the additional features of small energy spread and precise energy determination , these machines offer a unique possibility for studying the line - shape of the sm higgs boson , and determining its mass and width with an accuracy of about .1 mev and .5 mev , respectively .",
    "in addition , if supersymmetric particles will be discovered at the lhc , then the muon colliders would play the role of a precision machine for studying their main properties , such as masses , widths , and couplings , and delineating their line - shapes @xcite .    in the two - higgs doublet models in general  @xcite , and in most susy scenarios in particular  @xcite ,",
    "the extended scalar sector contains five physical fields : a couple of charged higgs bosons ( @xmath3 ) , a cp - odd scalar @xmath1 , and two cp - even scalars @xmath4 ( the lightest , which is to be identified with the sm higgs ) and @xmath0 ( the heaviest ) .",
    "the detailed study of the @xmath0-@xmath1 system is particularly interesting because in most _ beyond the sm _ scenarios ( such as susy ) the masses of these two particles are almost degenerate , and therefore their resonant production is expected to give rise to nearly overlapping resonances  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the tree - level mass eigenvalues of the higgs mass matrices are given by @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and therefore one will have the tree - level bounds @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , in the decoupling limit @xmath8 , the neutral sector ( tree - level ) masses satisfy the relations  @xcite @xmath9 which , for @xmath10 ( and thus @xmath11 ) , imply the degeneracies @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    in general ,",
    "the inclussion of radiative corrections is known to modify significantly the above tree - level relations , mainly due to the large yukawa coupling of the top - quark .",
    "such corrections are particularly important for the lower bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson @xmath4 : for the largest bulk of the parameter space , @xmath4 is in fact heavier than the @xmath14 boson , and can be as heavy as 130 gev  @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that the inclusion of radiative corrections does _ not _ lift the mass degeneracy in the @xmath0-@xmath1 system under consideration , especially in the parameter space region where @xmath15 and @xmath10   @xcite .",
    "in particular , as we will see in detail below , quantum effects do shift the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but by amounts that are numerically comparable ; as a result , the small mass splitting between @xmath0 and @xmath1 remains still valid ( but is not described quantitatively by eq .",
    "( [ deg ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , as was shown by pilaftsis  @xcite , the near degeneracy of the @xmath0-@xmath1 system may give rise to a resonant enhancement of cp violation due to particle mixing . specifically ,",
    "if the cp symmetry is exact , the @xmath0 can not mix with @xmath1 , at any given order .",
    "however , in the presence of a cp - violating interactions @xcite , in addition to a variety of interesting implications  @xcite , the @xmath0 can mix with the @xmath1 already at one - loop level , giving rise to a non - vanishing mixing self - energy @xmath18 . such mixing , in turn , can be measured through the study of appropriate cp - odd observables , such as left - right asymmetries . as has been explained in @xcite , in general the cp - violating amplitude",
    "is particularly enhanced near resonace , if the two mixing particles are nearly degenerate , a condition which is naturally fullfilled in the @xmath0-@xmath1 system .",
    "furthermore , the mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 has an additional profound effect for the two masses : the near degeneracy of the two particles is lifted , and the pole masses move further apart @xcite ; as a result , the originally overlapping resonances of the cp - invariant theory tend to be separated .",

    ", @xmath22 allows for smaller ( upper - left panel , @xmath23 ) or larger ( lower panels , left @xmath24 and right @xmath25 ) values of @xmath21 which are consequently plotted in th blue dashed - dotted curves .",
    "also in these cases one can distinguish the cp - invariant and cp - breaking phase of the theory due to the very different energy behavior of the cross section ; also notice that too lower values of @xmath21 predicts , in the parameter range chosen here , a too low mass for the lightest higgs , and therefore would be in any case excluded ( _ e.g. _ when @xmath23 , @xmath26 gev ) . for smaller values of the cp - breaking phase @xmath27",
    "we get a somewhat different situation . in fig.[cross - sec30 ] , the same set of plots as before is shown for @xmath28 : for small values of @xmath21 ( upper panels ) it is still possible to discriminate the phase of the theory , while for larger values ( lower panels ) the effects of @xmath29 mixing vanishes much more rapidly than in the previous case .",
    "the cp - even and cp - odd neutral higgs scalars , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , together with their charged companions and the `` standard '' higgs boson , constitute the extended scalar sector of generic two - higgs doublet models , and appear naturally in supersymmetric extensions of the sm .",
    "therefore it is expected that their discovery and subsequenet study of their fundamental physical properties should be of central importance in the next decades .",
    "in addition to the lhc , where their primary discovery might take place , further detailed studies of their characteristics have been proposed in recent years , most notably in the context of muon-@xcite and photon colliders  @xcite .    of particular interest",
    "is the possibility of encountering cp violation in the higgs sector of two - higgs doublet models , induced by the one - loop mixing of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the latter is produced due to cp - violating ( tree - level ) interactions of each one of these two higgs bosons with particles such as scalar quarks or majorana neutrinos , to name a few , which will circulate in the ( otherwise vanishing ) @xmath0-@xmath1 transition amplitude ( fig.1 ) .",
    "a most appealing feature of the @xmath0-@xmath1 system is that , due to their relative small mass - difference , possible cp - mixing effects undergo resonant enhancement  @xcite .",
    "such effect may be observed in appropriately constructed left - right asymmetries , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "since these observables are odd under cp , a non - vanishing experimental result would constitute an unequivocal signal of cp violation .",
    "in this paper we have explored the possibility of detecting the presence of cp - mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 through the detailed study of the cross - section of the @xmath2-channel process @xmath30 as function of the center - of - mass energy . although the lineshape is a cp - even quantity , there are certain characteristics that signal the presence of a cp - violating mixing . in the context of the photon colliders",
    ", ref.@xcite also discusses both cp - even and cp - odd observables in terms of photon polarizations .",
    "as has been explained in a series of papers   @xcite , the high - resolution scanning of the lineshape of this process is expected to reveal two relatively closely spaced , or even superimposed , resonances , corresponding to the nearly degenerate @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "as was recognized in @xcite , the presence of cp - mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 modifies the position of the pole mass , and tends to push the two resonances further apart . of course",
    ", this fact by itself could not serve as a signal for the presence of cp - mixing ; one could simply envisage the situation where all fundamental interactions are cp - conserving and there is no cp - mixing , and the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 assume simply from the beginning their shifted values .",
    "the result of our analysis is very positive and represents , in our opinion , a significant step in the search of the cp - properties of two scalar - doublet models : _ either the mass - splitting of the h and a higgs boson , in a cp - mixing scenario , can not be accounted for in absence of cp - mixing , and/or the detailed energy dependence of the line - shape allows to discriminate between both scenarios_.    even though in our analysis we have considered only the mssm due to its phenomenological relevance , we however expect that our analysis will hold in general for two higgs doublet models , independently from the specific type of mechanism which will give rise to the cp - breaking loops of fig.[feyndiag ] ( a ) . for example",
    "similar results are expected in the case of a two higgs doublet model in which the particles circulating in the loop are three generations of heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) for which the mixing amplitude will be given by @xcite @xmath33,\\nonumber \\\\ & & b_1(s , m_i , m_j ) = \\frac{m_j^2 - m_i^2}{2s}b_0(s , m_i , m_j ) - b_0(0,m_i , m_j ) - \\frac12b_0(s , m_i , m_j),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 playing the role of the mssm cp - breaking phase @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the combined study of cp - odd observables , such as left - right asymmetries , together with the @xmath0-@xmath1 lineshape , may furnish a powerful panoply for attacking the isssue of cp violation in two - higss doublet models .",
