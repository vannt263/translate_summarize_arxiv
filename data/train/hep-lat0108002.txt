    "the observation of an asymmetry between @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks in the proton sea @xcite , to take just one example , has served to highlight the important role that the pion cloud of the nucleon and the chiral symmetry of qcd @xcite plays in hadronic structure , even at high energies .    more generally",
    ", studies of pdfs can help with the task of identifying the appropriate effective degrees of freedom of qcd at low energies . through the application of the operator product expansion ( ope ) to qcd",
    ", high energy processes such as deep inelastic scattering can be factorized into short and long distance contributions , allowing one to calculate the former in perturbation theory , while isolating all of the nonperturbative physics in the latter . over the past two decades considerable",
    "experience has been accumulated with various nonperturbative , low energy models of the nucleon which have been used to study pdfs @xcite .",
    "initial studies focused on the valence quark distributions as a means of constraining valence quark model parameters , although recently more ambitious efforts have attempted to describe sea quark and gluon distributions from low energy models .",
    "although the model studies have been helpful in exploring the relationship between high energy processes and low energy phenomenology , ultimately one would like a more exact connection of pdfs with qcd .",
    "a mathematically more rigorous approach is provided through lattice qcd .",
    "indeed , the determination of the moments of the pdfs is one of the benchmark calculations of hadron structure in lattice qcd .",
    "modern computational advances have allowed large scale simulations to be undertaken which are progressively improving the errors associated with finite lattice spacings and finite volume effects . however , until recently @xcite large differences between lattice results and experiment have remained .    because pdfs are light cone correlation functions , it is not possible to calculate them directly on the lattice in euclidean space .",
    "instead one calculates moments of pdfs , defined ( for bjrken @xmath0 ) as : @xmath5 which are related through the ope to matrix elements of local twist - two operators .",
    "a number of calculations of pdf moments have been performed over the last decade , most notably by the qcdsf group @xcite in the quenched approximation .",
    "more recently , the mit group @xcite has confirmed the earlier quenched results , and in addition made the first unquenched simulations .",
    "these results indicate that at the relatively large quark masses at which the calculations were made , the unquenched results are indistinguishable from the quenched within the current errors .    despite the impressive progress of lattice calculations of moments of pdfs",
    ", there has been a long standing problem in reconciling the lattice data with experiment , which has posed a serious threat to the credibility of current lattice calculations .",
    "namely , for the unpolarized moments all of the calculations to date , which have been made at quark masses of between 30 and 190  mev , have yielded results which are typically 50% larger than the experimental values when linearly extrapolated to the physical quark masses .",
    "this discrepancy was recently resolved with the observation @xcite that a linear extrapolation in quark mass omits crucial physics associated with the long range structure of the nucleon in the form of the pion cloud . in particular",
    ", the inclusion of the nonlinear , nonanalytic dependence on the quark mass in the extrapolation of the moments from the region of large quark masses to the physical , light quark masses allows one to fit both the lattice data and the experimental values with good accuracy @xcite .",
    "it therefore restores confidence in the extraction of all hadron observables from current simulations .    in this paper",
    "we go one step further and ask what can the lattice data tell us about the @xmath0 dependence of the pdfs themselves ?",
    "in particular , we shall extract the valence nonsinglet distribution @xmath6 by extrapolating the lattice data to the physical region using a form that ensures the correct behavior in the chiral and heavy quark limits . in section  ii we examine the initial question of the extent to which the @xmath0 dependence can be determined from just a few low moments of a pdf .",
    "after establishing the accuracy to which the pdf can be reconstructed , we then extract the valence @xmath6 distribution from the calculated lattice moments in section  iii . using the chiral extrapolation formula , we compute the @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath6 distribution as a function of quark mass . in section",
    "iv we discuss the implications of the results for masses of mesons lying on the @xmath2 regge trajectory .",
    "finally , in section  v we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the reconstruction of the complete @xmath0 dependence of a pdf in principle requires infinitely many moments , so that _ a priori _ the task of building up a pdf from only a few , low moments may seem rather ambitious .",
    "this is especially true for pdfs at large @xmath0 , information on which is contained in higher moments . on the lattice , because of problems with operator mixing for operators with spin @xmath7 , all lattice calculations have so far been restricted to @xmath8 .",
    "it is crucial , therefore , if one is to ever make use of lattice data to learn about pdfs , to see which features of the pdfs can be reconstructed from just the lowest 3 or 4 moments .",
    "formally , the @xmath0 dependence of the pdf can be obtained by performing an inverse mellin transform of the moments .",
    "if enough moments are known ( and can be continued to complex @xmath9 ) , one can make a reliable reconstruction of the distributions numerically ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , since lattice data available at present ( and in the foreseeable future ) only exist for the first three nontrivial moments , this procedure becomes impractical .",
    "alternatively , one can reconstruct the parameters in a given pdf parameterization by working with the moments directly .",
    "a similar method was applied to the reconstruction of polarized parton distributions in ref.@xcite , while in ref.@xcite the @xmath0 dependence of pdfs was investigated subject to constraints on their small- and large-@xmath0 behavior . in the present work , however , we wish to determine what constraints on the @xmath0 dependence of the valence distribution are imposed by the actual lattice data .    a typical parameterization of quark ( or antiquark ) distributions used in global fits @xcite is of the form : @xmath10 for which the corresponding moments are given by : @xmath11\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the @xmath13-function .",
    "for a given set of pdf moments , the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be fitted using eq .",

    "while the present analysis can be easily extended to the singlet sector , the singlet quark distribution on the lattice receives contributions from disconnected diagrams , corresponding to operator insertions in quark lines which are disconnected ( except through gluon lines ) from the nucleon source .",
    "disconnected diagrams are considerably more difficult to compute , so only exploratory studies of these have so far been completed @xcite . on the other hand , since the disconnected contributions are flavor independent ( for equal @xmath17 and @xmath18 quark masses ) , they cancel exactly in the nonsinglet @xmath1 combination .    to enable comparison with the reconstructed distributions , we employ eq .",
    "( [ param ] ) to construct an ` average parameterization ' from the global pdf analyses .",
    "note that the pdf fits in refs.@xcite are given for @xmath19 and @xmath20 separately , whereas here we require a parameterization of the difference .",
    "using an equally weighted numerical fit to the @xmath21 difference ( at next - to - leading order in the @xmath22 scheme , at a scale @xmath23  gev@xmath24 ) from the parameterizations of ref.@xcite , we find an average fit : @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and with @xmath30 determined by the normalization condition , @xmath31 .",
    "figure  [ reconstruct ] shows the average distribution ( long - dashed line ) , with the spread between the three parameterizations indicated by the shaded region .",

    "the parameters determined by @xmath37 fits with each of the remaining forms give rise to similar distributions .",
    "we use the differences in the values of the parameters found from the various fits as an indication of the systematic error in the reconstruction procedure .",
    "in particular , for the parameter @xmath38 ( which is of special interest because of its relation to regge phenomenology  see section  iv below ) , we find the best fit value @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ reconstruct ] shows the reconstructed @xmath40 distribution ( short  dashed line ) which is generated by the fit form ( i ) using all six moments above . with just the lowest 4 moments , however ( as are available from lattice data )",
    ", this form does not produce an accurate fit , as one is attempting to constrain more parameters than the number of data points permit . in our parameter counting .",
    "] this is illustrated by the dotted line in the fig .",
    "[ reconstruct ] .",
    "in contrast , with fit ( vii ) , which has only 3 free parameters , one can obtain a fairly reliable reconstruction even when fitting to only the @xmath41 moments , as indicated by the solid curve in figure  [ reconstruct ] .    as well as understanding the systematic uncertainty associated with the functional form of the distribution to be reconstructed , one must also quantify the error arising from the use of only a fixed number of moments .",
    "when the number of moments used with fitting form ( vii ) is increased to 4 , 5 or 6 the fit improves by only a few percent . with four moments , fits ( ii ) , ( v ) and ( vi ) also give acceptable results , similar to those shown for fit ( vii ) . for simplicity , however , we will concentrate on fit form ( vii ) hereafter .    the overall agreement between the original and reconstructed distributions",
    "is clearly excellent , and comparable to the difference between different parameterizations ( shaded region in fig .",
    "[ reconstruct ] ) . having confidence that a reliable reconstruction is possible from just the lowest few moments ,",
    "we next ask what do extrapolations of lattice data on the @xmath42 moments tell us about the @xmath0 dependence of the distribution @xmath43 ?",
    "a crucial question for relating lattice calculations to phenomenology is the reliability of the extrapolation from the region of large quark masses ( @xmath44 ) to the physical value .",
    "typically , lattice data have been analyzed assuming a linear dependence on the quark mass . however , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , if one is to extrapolate the lattice moments into a region where pion loops play an important role , it is vital to use an extrapolation formula which has the correct chiral behavior . in this section",
    "we first motivate an extrapolation formula which ensures both the correct chiral and heavy quark limits . following this",
    ", we use the values of the moments at physical quark masses extracted from the lattice data to reconstruct the @xmath0 dependence of the nonsinglet distribution .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the chiral su@xmath45(n@xmath46)@xmath47su@xmath48(n@xmath46 ) symmetry of qcd generates the nearly massless goldstone bosons ( pions ) , whose importance in hadron structure is well documented . at small pion masses , hadronic observables can be systematically expanded in a series in @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the expansion coefficients are generally free parameters , determined from phenomenology or obtained from low energy models .",
    "one of the unique consequences of pion loops , however , is the appearance of so - called chiral logs . from the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation one finds that @xmath50 at small @xmath49 , so that these terms are nonanalytic functions of the quark mass . because the nonanalytic terms arise from the infra - red behavior of the chiral loops , they are generally model independent .",
    "for some observables these nonanalytic terms give rise to large deviations from linearity near the chiral limit @xcite .    the leading order ( in @xmath49 )",
