    "exclusive high - energy processes can be factorized into hard and soft subprocesses , where the hard subprocess can be evaluated perturbatively and is characteristic for the reaction in question .",
    "the soft subprocess , described by the nucleon distribution amplitude @xmath2 , contains the information about the distribution of the three valence quark momentum fractions @xmath3 inside the nucleon @xcite .",
    "the great interest in this quantity stems from its importance for , e.g. , the calculation of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and their scaling behavior .",
    "these form factors describe a nucleon absorbing a virtual photon of squared momentum @xmath4 while remaining intact . according to @xcite , for @xmath5 , the magnetic form factor of the nucleon",

    "distribution amplitudes are genuinely non - perturbative quantities .",
    "hence they are inaccessible for perturbation theory and must be calculated by other means , e.g. , by lattice qcd . after a pioneering study in the late 1980s @xcite only recently the first quantitative results from lattice qcd have been published @xcite . after performing an expansion near the lightcone",
    ", moments of the nucleon distribution amplitudes are expressed in terms of matrix elements of local three - quark operators that are evaluated between a nucleon state and the vacuum .",
    "these three - quark operators typically consist of a combination of covariant derivatives acting on the three quark fields , which are located at a common space - time coordinate @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the operators for the nucleon are color singlets and have isospin @xmath13 .    as the three - quark operators pick up radiative corrections and are subject to mixing with other operators , their renormalization is a vital ingredient for any lattice calculation . in a previous paper @xcite we have derived irreducible multiplets of three - quark operators with respect to the spinorial hypercubic group @xmath14 and",
    "have discussed the mixing properties of these operators in detail .",
    "the present work will focus on the non - perturbative renormalization of these three - quark operators in the isospin-@xmath13 sector .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first section",
    ", we will introduce an ri - mom renormalization scheme which will be implemented in our lattice calculations .",
    "then we will explain how to perform a perturbative scheme matching to @xmath0 and derive the anomalous dimensions of the operators in question .",
    "the following two sections will focus on a discussion of our results for the renormalization matrices , which are finally quoted at @xmath1 in the @xmath0 scheme . in the final section",
    "we will demonstrate how to renormalize moments of the nucleon distribution amplitude and present the results of consistency checks between the renormalized moments .",
    "our main aim is the derivation of non - perturbative renormalization coefficients for three - quark operators in lattice qcd and their application to the renormalization of moments of the nucleon distribution amplitude .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , a subsequent convolution with the hard scattering kernel leads then , e.g. , to estimates for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
    "therefore the renormalization of the hard scattering kernel and the three - quark operators inside the nucleon distribution amplitudes must be carried out in a consistent way , i.e. , the same renormalization scheme has to be applied .",
    "as the perturbative results for the hard subprocess are usually given in the @xmath0 scheme , the distribution amplitudes must also be renormalized in this scheme .    on the lattice , however , it is not possible to implement the @xmath0 scheme .",
    "therefore one introduces the ri - mom renormalization scheme @xcite .",
    "it is applicable both on the lattice and in the continuum .",
    "then one first renormalizes the matrix elements on the lattice within this scheme .",
    "afterwards one applies continuum perturbation theory to calculate a matching function between both schemes and extracts non - perturbatively renormalized lattice operators in the @xmath0 scheme . in this section",
    "we will discuss the setup and implementation of the lattice renormalization .",
    "we are interested in three - quark operators for the nucleon . choosing the flavors @xmath15 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for definiteness , their general form is @xmath17 with analogous definitions for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "after projection onto isospin 1/2 one ends up with operators for the proton , and subsequent exchange of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 fields leads to neutron operators . the color indices @xmath20 will be suppressed when not required .",

    "we have derived multiplets of three - quark operators that transform irreducibly under the spinorial symmetry group of the hypercubic lattice @xmath14 .",
    "these operators reduce the problem of mixing under renormalization to mixing among multiplets belonging to equivalent representations of @xmath14 .",
    "hence they define our choice for the coefficient tensors @xmath21 .",

    "note however that this continuum relation holds only up to discretization errors on the lattice .",
    "let us finally give an example of a typical three - quark operator belonging to an irreducibly transforming multiplet .",
    "we have , e.g. , the following operator with two derivatives : @xmath35 the superscript ma ( standing for `` mixed antisymmetric '' ) indicates that the operator has isospin 1/2 while the subscript @xmath36 means that the derivatives act on the first and second quark , compare @xcite .",
    "pauli matrices @xmath37 are used to contract the covariant derivatives .",
    "the curly braces denote independent total symmetrization in the dotted and undotted indices of the weyl representation .",
    "we introduce a correlation function for the non - perturbative renormalization of the three - quark operators by contracting the operators with three external quark sources , namely @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath41 we have two @xmath15-quark lines and one @xmath16-line running from the three space - time coordinates @xmath42 into a vertex at @xmath12 .",
