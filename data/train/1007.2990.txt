    "an important feature of black hole spacetimes is the existence of trapped and marginally trapped surfaces .",
    "these surfaces are a key element in the penrose singularity theorem and are frequently used in numerical relativity to indicate the existence of a black hole .",
    "recent work has introduced related concepts such as trapping horizons and dynamical horizons both of which , ignoring certain technical conditions , can be viewed 3-surfaces obtained by time - evolutions of marginally trapped surfaces .",
    "it has been shown that these surfaces have many properties similar to event horizons , in particular their thermodynamic properties @xcite . trapping and dynamical horizons",
    "can also be used to extract data about the black hole , such as its mass and angular momentum , directly from the strong gravity region without needing to rely on the asymptotic behaviour or exact isometries @xcite .",
    "however , it has been known for a long time that the location and existence of trapped surfaces depends on the choice of spacetime foliation , i.e. on the choice of the time coordinate , and this is the main reason why event horizons have often been preferred over trapping and dynamical horizons as a definition of the surface of a black hole . in particular this",
    "means that any given , suitably general , spacetime that contains a trapping horizon is likely to contain , in principle , an infinite number of trapping and dynamical horizons that intersect but are distinct @xcite .",
    "the key results for quasi - local horizons , for example the laws of black hole mechanics and the energy and angular momentum balance laws @xcite , are sufficiently general and are applicable to all of these different horizons . nevertheless ,",
    "if we wish to assign say mass and spin to the black hole quasi - locally , the time evolution of these quantities will depend on which horizon we choose to use .",
    "thus , to use quasi - local horizons to extract meaningful data from black hole spacetimes it is important to investigate the location of these distinct horizons and how this affects their related properties such as mass , angular momentum , linear momentum etc .",
    "this issue is potentially relevant for gravitational wave astronomy when one seeks to infer the physical parameters of the source from the observed gravitational wave signal .",
    "for example , in modeling binary black hole coalescence it becomes important to combine results from post - newtonian theory and numerical relativity .",
    "numerical relativity can in principle evolve a binary black hole system starting from the inspiral phase all the way through the coalescence ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "however , this becomes computationally impossible if we start the black holes very far apart , and if we wish to cover a large parameter space .",
    "post - newtonian theory on the other hand treats the black holes as point particles endowed with a mass and spin , and solves the field equations in powers of @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the orbital velocity of the black holes .",
    "this approximation works best when the black holes are far apart and breaks down near the coalescence .",
    "thus , in order to fully solve the binary black hole problem it becomes essential to combine the two frameworks .",
    "the literature on this topic is large and a full discussion is beyond the scope of this paper ; see e.g. @xcite . for our purposes",
    ", we note that the two frameworks treat black holes very differently ; post - newtonian theory treats the black holes as point particles while numerical relativity deals with the horizons non - perturbatively .",
    "it turns out that using different flavors of post - newtonian approximants leads to biases in the values of physical parameters @xcite ( as infered from the gravitational waveforms )",
    ". numerical relativity on the other hand deals with black hole horizons , and if we decide to use quasi - local horizon measures for calculating physical quantities , the values of the black hole parameters will be affected by the choice of foliation .",
    "this effect is absent when the black holes are isolated ; thus we expect it to be negligible in the inspiral phase and to be larger in the dynamical coalescence phase . in comparing the results from the two frameworks ,",
    "it is useful then to quantify this source of uncertainty and to show that errors in the physical parameters are smaller than the biases between , say , different post - newtonian approximants .",
    "another area where the location of horizons is important is in black hole thermodynamics .",
    "if the area of a black hole horizon is to play a role analogous to entropy via the bekenstein - hawking relation it is important to know which area this relation should be applied to in which situations . for stationary black holes ,",
    "cross - sections of the event horizon are marginally trapped surfaces and thus the different notions of black hole horizons ( i.e. event horizons and trapping horizons ) coincide . however , in a dynamical spacetime the event horizon will not coincide with the location of any of the trapping horizons . in general",
    "they will have different areas on a given spacelike hypersurface @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although the location of the event horizon does not depend on the choice of spacetime foliation , when the event horizon is growing or shrinking , its area will depend on the choice of foliation .",
    "non - stationary spacetimes with dynamical black holes are complicated , and only a few exact dynamical black hole solutions are known .",
    "one class of solutions is the vaidya solutions , which describe the evolution of a spherically symmetric , radially moving , pressureless null fluid with a freely specifiable mass function @xmath4 .",
    "this is a useful and non - trivial toy - model for a dynamical black hole .",
    "these spacetimes can be used to qualitatively model the physical accretion of matter by a black hole .",
    "some authors @xcite have even suggested using the vaidya spacetimes to simulate the decrease in area of a black hole due to hawking radiation , by allowing the infalling matter to be negative .",
    "the uniqueness of dynamical horizons in general spacetimes was investigated in @xcite where it was shown that the foliation of a given dynamical horizon by marginally trapped surfaces is unique , and that it is not possible to foliate a region with dynamical horizons since they intersect . in the vaidya solution",
    "it has already been shown explicitly that marginally outer trapped surfaces ( mots ) can be found at various different locations depending on the slicing @xcite , although this reference did not investigate how the parameters of the black hole , such as area , mass and angular momentum vary with slicing and did not consider the case of timelike trapping horizons .",
    "ben - dov @xcite showed how to find marginally outer trapped surfaces arbitrarily close to the event horizon .",
    "it was also shown that there are flat regions inside the event horizon ( the region contained within the shell ) where no trapped surface passes .",
    "bengtsson and senovilla @xcite analytically constructed trapped surfaces that pass through the flat region .",
    "this is not a contradiction ; while there are some flat regions where no trapped surface can be located , there are trapped surfaces in other parts of the flat region . in spherically symmetric spacetimes",
    "spherically symmetric marginally trapped surfaces are easy to find and in the case of vaidya are given by the condition @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the areal coordinate ( @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the area of the mots ) of the surfaces of spherical isometry .",
    "it is also easy to show that such surfaces foliate a trapping horizon which we will refer to as the spherically symmetric trapping horizon . due to results in @xcite",
    ", any other dynamical horizon will lie partially outside the spherically symmetric dynamical horizon somewhere .",
    "for example , in @xcite analytic solutions were presented where closed trapped surfaces extend into the region between the spherically symmetric trapping horizon and the event horizon .",
    "the surfaces we find here do the same .",
    "in this article we will look at the variation of black hole parameters for horizons located on various different slicings of the same spacetime .",
    "we will examine several different spherically symmetric mass functions ; a linear mass function designed to see the behaviour for slowing evolving black holes and a tanh log mass function , designed to see the behaviour in a short collapse of a shell to a black hole .",
    "we compare marginally outer trapped surfaces found on non - spherically symmetric hypersurfaces with those found on the spherically symmetric slicings .",
    "we are able to locate the spherically symmetric horizons analytically but the non - spherically symmetric horizons are located numerically using the ahfinderdirect thorn @xcite of the cactus framework @xcite .",
    "a number of useful analytic relations for the vaidya spacetime are given in the appendix .",
    "background detail on the properties of trapping horizons and their thermodynamics can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to examine the slicing dependence of quasi - local horizons we need to consider dynamical spacetimes .",
    "the vaidya solutions have a number of nice properties that make them popular for investigations of this type @xcite .",
    "the vaidya spacetimes @xcite are a class of spherically symmetric , non - vacuum spacetimes with line element in advanced null eddington - finkelstein coordinates @xmath9 : s^2 = - ( 1- ) v^2 + 2vr + r^2 ^ 2 + r^2 ^ 2 ^ 2 .the function @xmath4 is a a freely specifiable mass function ; it coincides with the misner - sharp mass @xcite in this case . in",
    "advanced eddington - finkelstein coordinates the metric is well defined across future horizons .",
    "the vaidya metric solves the einstein equations with an energy - momentum tensor of the form t_ab = e n_a n_b , where @xmath10 is an ingoing radial null direction and @xmath11 is a function that depends on the normalization of @xmath10 .",
    "for example , for the case where @xmath12 then we have [ nec ] t_ab^a^b= , when @xmath13 and defining @xmath14 .",
    "the vaidya solution can be interpreted as describing the radial collapse of pressureless null dust ( i.e.  infalling radiation ) . from the appendix",
    "we can see that , in a spherically symmetric foliation , trapping horizons will occur at @xmath5 provided we keep @xmath15 .    here",
    "we will study various mass functions for @xmath4 .",
    "the simplest is a linear mass function of the form [ linearmass ] m(v ) = m_0 + v .the linear mass function is suited to situations where the black hole is accreting matter at a constant rate ( for a finite time duration to ensure that the mass stays finite ) . while the assumption of spherical symmetry is somewhat artificial , real astrophysical black holes do have very small mass accretion rates whether from the accretion of surrounding stars and gas or purely from the accretion of photons from the cosmic microwave background . in the vaidya solutions the misner - sharp mass on each ingoing constant @xmath3 surface is a constant .",
    "this reflects the fact that the mass is flowing inwards at the speed of light and the mass contained within a shell of radius @xmath6 is constant as the radius decreases .",
    "although the spacetime is dynamical we can still define observers who remain at a fixed areal radius @xmath6 and fixed @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in terms of the proper time @xmath18 of such observers we have = .at large distances from the black hole @xmath19 we can use this to relate directly the mass flux in terms of the null coordinate @xmath3 to the mass flux as seen by constant @xmath20 observers who would be static observers in an exactly static spacetime , ~ .we can give a very rough indication of the order of magnitude for @xmath21 that might be expected for certain astrophysical cases .",
    "the eddington rate is used to estimate the maximal rate at which infalling matter can be supported by its own radiation pressure and large , luminous black holes are typically found with luminosities between @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the eddington limit @xcite . for a black hole accreting at a tenth of the eddington limit",
    "the dimensionless accretion rate is approximately @xcite 10 ^ -22 ( ) .this is @xmath24 ergs per second for a solar mass black hole .",
    "the matter falling into the black hole is ten times the energy being emitted as light . since this accretion is usually associated with a disk though it will not be spherically symmetric . for a black hole accreting purely from the cosmic microwave background , which is assumed to be isotropic",
    ", we have from the stefan - boltzmann law , approximately 10 ^ -50()^4()^2 .for a black hole whose dynamics are dominated by evaporation through hawking radiation we have -10 ^ -81()^2",
    ".for numerical purposes we will investigate evolutions with mass rates much higher than astrophysical rates , typically @xmath25 .",
    "to the extent that @xmath26 , the spherically symmetric trapping horizon will still be a slowly evolving horizon in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we will also look at mass functions of the @xmath27 form , with @xmath28 for @xmath29 and for @xmath30 [ tanhlogmass ] m(v ) = ( 1 + ( ( ) ) ) = the first derivative of this tanh log mass function vanishes at @xmath31 . therefore the metric and its first derivative are contiunous at @xmath31 . for @xmath32 and @xmath33 greater than zero ,",
    "this mass function models the collapse of a hollow spherical shell of matter @xmath34 that asymptotically settles down to an isolated black hole of mass @xmath33 for @xmath35 . these types of mass functions model situations where the black hole grows initially quite rapidly and then asymptotically settles down to its final static state .",
    "the mass function reaches half its asymptotic value when @xmath36 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath21 for these tanh log functions occurs at @xmath37 and takes a value @xmath38 . therefore these solutions will not be slowly evolving in the sense of @xcite for @xmath33 and @xmath32 of similar sizes .",
    "the trapping horizons are three - dimensional surfaces @xmath39 , foliated by closed spacelike two surfaces for which the future directed null normals @xmath40 and @xmath10 satisfy _ ( ) = 0 , _ (",
    "n ) < 0 , _ n _ ( ) < 0 . here @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the expansions of @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , and @xmath45 is the lie derivative along @xmath44 .",
    "dynamical horizons are also three - dimensional surfaces foliated , as above , by spheres with @xmath46 , @xmath47 . however , @xmath48 is replaced by the requirement that @xmath39 be spacelike . for the spherically symmetric horizons in vaidya ,",
    "these notions coincide @xcite .    for spherically symmetric slicings",
    ", the null normals associated with the trapping horizon will be radial null vectors and the location of the trapping horizon is just given by r=2m(v ) [ r_is_two_m ] .this is a spacelike surface for @xmath49 , a null surface for @xmath50 and a timelike surface for @xmath51 .",
    "for the linear mass function , in terms of the timelike coordinate @xmath52 , the horizons will be located at r = [ r_is_not_two_m ] . for the @xmath53 mass function",
    "the horizons are located at the solution of the cubic r^3 + ( 2t-2m_0)r^2 + ( t^2+t^2 - 4m_0t)r - 2m_0t^2 = 0",
    ".the equation for the horizon @xmath5 has a single unique solution on each surface of constant @xmath3 .",
    "but it can have multiple solutions , corresponding to multiple horizons , on surfaces of constant @xmath54 . for @xmath55",
    "this cubic function always has at least one positive real root and guarantees that there will always be at least one horizon .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that there will only be a single horizon for @xmath56 . for small values of @xmath54",
    "there are multiple horizons and this will also be the case for other mass functions .",
    "we will use numerical methods to solve the trapping horizon equations for non - spherically symmetric slicings and postpone discussion of them until the next section . due to results in @xcite",
    "we expect that the non - spherically symmetric trapping horizons will intersect the spherically symmetric ones .",
    "the event horizons are defined as the past causal boundary of future null infinity and are generated by null geodesics that fail to reach infinity .",
    "the event horizon is always a null surface since it is a causal boundary . in the vaidya",
    "spacetimes it is generated by radial outgoing null vectors that satisfy = ( 1- ) .[ehlocation ] this first order ordinary differential equation generates the path of all outgoing radial null geodesics . in order to give the location of the event horizon it requires a boundary condition that corresponds to the known location of the event horizon at some particular point . in practice",
    "this is usually given by the position of the event horizon at some future point , either when the black hole evaporates entirely or settles down to a stationary state .",
    "if the black hole at some point settles down to a schwarzschild black hole with no further matter accreting , then the event horizon can be located by tracing back the null rays from the future schwarzschild radius .",
    "however , in the situation where the black hole is accreting matter at a steady rate and is a suitably long way from changing to a different state one can find the approximate location of the event horizon by imposing the condition = 0 .this just reflects the fact that the event horizon is growing at a steady rate @xcite .",
    "in this case , equation ( [ ehlocation ] ) has the general solution r = ( 1- ) .for @xmath57 this gives [ rehsmallmdot ] r = 2m(v)(1 + 4 + ( ^2 ) ) and thus we expect that the event horizon will be outside the spherically symmetric trapping horizon for @xmath49 but inside for @xmath51 .",
    "for a solar - mass black hole accreting at a tenth of the eddington rate the difference in areas between the event horizon and the spherically symmetric trapping horizon will be around @xmath58 in units of planck area , while for a supermassive black hole of mass @xmath59 solar masses , accreting purely form the cmb , the difference in areas will be around @xmath60 in planck units @xcite . in terms of the coordinate @xmath52 for the linear mass function",
    "the event horizon has radial coordinate r ~ + .this is just the location of the spherically symmetric trapping horizon with a constant offset of @xmath61 provided @xmath57 . in this approximation the generators of both the trapping horizon and the event horizon",

    "we consider a simple axisymmetric slicing of the form [ eq : tvralphaz ] |t = v - r - z , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is a parameter that determines how far away from spherically symmetry the constant @xmath65 surface is .",
    "we reserve the symbol @xmath54 for spherically symmetric surfaces where @xmath66 , which just gives the usual eddington - finkelstein time coordinate ( although not the schwarzschild time coordinate ) .",

    ". the orbit of spherical rotations of each point will lie entirely in the hypersurface .",
    "this will lead to mots that are spherically symmetric , where each surface is just the orbit of spherical rotations .",
    "commonly used slicings in numerical relativity such as constant mean curvature surfaces will typically be spherically symmetric in the vaidya spacetime . in this case",
    "the horizons will be located uniquely at @xmath5 and every point on the surface will have the same value of the advanced time @xmath3 .",
    "this will not be the case for surfaces with @xmath76 . in these cases",
    "the mass parameter @xmath4 will not necessarily take the same value on different points of the surface .",
    "the mots will then extend into regions where the matter is more compact and regions where it is less compact .",
    "surfaces with @xmath77 will be the same as surfaces with @xmath78 , with the north pole ( @xmath79 ) interchanged with the south pole ( @xmath80 ) or , equivalently @xmath81 .",
    "each different choice of @xmath65 will lead to different mots than can be stacked to form different trapping horizons .",
    "each of these trapping horizons will have an associated natural foliation , the one that makes each two dimensional surface a mots .",
    "however we can also consider the intersection of a given trapping horizon with a spacelike hypersurface of a given @xmath64 value different from the natural one .",
    "we can compute the area of the these closed two spheres , although for @xmath76 they are not mots .",

    "the choice of different foliations leads to different mots that can be deformed into each other . using these deformations",
    "it is possible to examine how certain geometric properties of surfaces change with the deformation @xcite .",
    "for example , it is possible to see how the area element , @xmath84 , changes as mots are deformed into one another .",
    "we can search for mots on slices with different values of @xmath65 but because these marginally trapped surfaces do not lie on the same hypersurface it is difficult to compare them .",
    "if they do not intersect ( and typically they do nt ) it may or may not be possible to find a trapping horizon that connects both surfaces .",

    "[ fig : eh_ah_area ] compares the area of the event horizon ( or more precisely , the intersection of the event horizon with the spatial slices corresponding to different values of @xmath64 ) with the area of the mots as functions of @xmath64 .",
    "it is interesting that the variation in the event horizon area is much larger than for the apparent horizon .",
    "( dashed line ) and the mots @xmath125 for different values of @xmath64 for the linear mass function with @xmath126 .",
    "the y - axis on the left refers to the area of the event horizon and the axis on the right to the mots ; the scale of @xmath125 has been expanded to better show its variation .",
    "the variation of @xmath127 is much larger than the variation of @xmath125 and the variation of @xmath125 is small relative to the difference between @xmath127 and @xmath125 . ]      for the linear mass function the @xmath128 surfaces seem to have the same rate of change of area as the @xmath66 surfaces , at least to within numerical accuracy . for the tanh log mass function , as depicted in fig.([fig : areatime_tanhlogmass ] ) , the area of tilted horizons grows at a greater rate than the untilted areas and both converge to the asymptotic isolated horizon area , which will also be the asymptotic area of the event horizon . in this sense",
    "the spherically symmetric trapping horizon plays a special role as it is the one with the smallest rate of increase of area .",
    "this would seem to contradict the conjecture made in @xcite that the preferred trapping horizon should be the one where the area increases the most and approaches the event horizon the fastest .",
    "however , it is not known whether this behaviour is repeated in more general situations with other mass functions or other slicing conditions .",
    "we have investigated the slicing dependence of the apparent horizons in the vaidya spacetime . for a given slice",
    "we have looked at three types of horizons ; the mots that lie on the slice , the intersection of the slice with the event horizon and the intersection of the slice with the spherically symmetric trapping horizon .",
    "we have examined rather simple axisymmetric slicings in this simple spacetime .",
    "these simple slicings do not exhaust all possible axisymmetric slicings and there are many other possible slicings that are not axisymmetric .    explicitly",
    "the location of the horizons is different for different choices of horizon and different choices of slicing .",
    "however , for slowly evolving horizons , the areas do not vary by much , although the larger the rate at which the black hole accretes matter the larger the difference in the areas . for",
    "the @xmath1 vaidya solution with linear mass function the area can vary by approximately @xmath129 as @xmath64 is varied from @xmath130 to @xmath131 . beyond @xmath87 the cauchy surface becomes timelike for certain values of @xmath16 .",
    "this is the smallest value of @xmath21 that we investigated but it is still much larger than the mass accretion rate expected for astrophysical black holes .",
    "from a purely practical point of view we ve found evidence that the parameters of the black hole , derived from its trapping horizon , do not change significantly when looking at reasonably simple slicings .",
    "it is still unknown whether the properties would change drastically for certain unusual slicings , but these are unlikely to occur in normal numerical simulations .",
    "it is also reassuring that these differences are much smaller than the parameter biases of up to @xmath132 found between different post - newtonian models @xcite .",
    "this variation of the parameters with foliation will also occur if one uses the event horizon .    from a conceptual point of view",
    ", we have demonstrated explicitly the known result that the location of the black hole surface and some of its properties such as the area depend on the choice of the spacetime slicing .",
    "there are a variety of different possible responses to the issue of non - uniqueness of the trapping horizons in a given spacetime .",
    "the oldest approach is to focus purely on the event horizon as the unique indicator of the black hole and its properties .",
    "the location of the event horizon is independent of the choice of foliation .",
    "this approach however causes trouble in certain quantum inspired spacetimes @xcite where no event horizon exists .",
    "in numerical settings , the acausal definition of the event horizon means that it is only known after a simulation is finished , preventing it from being used to analyse the simulation s state as it proceeds .",
    "another approach is to accept all horizons on an equal footing as purely a property of the geometry . in this picture",
    "it is not clear how to associate unique properties to the black hole such as a horizon area or horizon angular momentum . because the horizons intersect one can not rely on specifying , for example , the outermost trapping horizon",
    "however , it may be possible to formulate a generalized second law for each possible foliation of spacetime and in this context use the horizon defined by the chosen foliation .",
    "a third approach is to look for the boundary of the region that admits trapped surfaces",
    ". this surface should be spherically symmetric in a spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "if this surface lies strictly outside the spherically symmetric trapping horizon then , by the results of @xcite , it can not itself admit the structure of a dynamical horizon .",
    "this surface will have a location that is independent of any given foliation , although it may not have a simple thermodynamic interpretation .",
    "a fourth approach is to look for properties that select out a certain preferred trapping horizon in the spacetime @xcite , such as the spherically symmetric horizon in a spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "this would require some additional condition to be imposed that selects out a unique trapping horizon from the many that occur in dynamical black hole spacetimes .    despite their quasi - local nature , closed marginally trapped surfaces",
    "do have some non - local behaviour .",
    "their dependence on the slicing is but one manifestation of this behaviour .",
    "the fact that marginally outer trapped surfaces can be found all the way to the event horizon @xcite is another manifestation .",
    "although the event horizon is a fully non - local teleologically defined surface , it still acts as the boundary of outer trapped surfaces in a vaidya spacetime that satisfies the null energy condition and asymptotes to a static schwarzschild solution in the far future .",
    "this behaviour is related to both the choice of the surface null normals and the requirement that the marginally trapped surface be closed .",
    "closed trapped surface can not be found entirely in a flat spacetime .",
    "however , parts of a closed marginally trapped surface can be found passing through a region of flat space where both null expansions are negative @xcite . it may be that in the quantum context only an effective horizon is meaningful or that the existence of many intersecting horizons contribute to the full path integral . for purely classical situations one may be able to refine the definition of the surface of a black hole",
