    "the studies of massive star formation are essentially important for astrophysics . because of their powerful protostellar or stellar winds and radiation , their formation is deeply concerned with activities of local star formation in galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "once massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) are formed , their strong activities immediately interact with surrounding clouds .",
    "this interaction often results in fragmentation and dispersion of the parental cloud , and sometimes stops following star formation .",
    "however , another star formation is triggered frequently in such compressed fragment . in spite of numerous observations and numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , quantitative and detailed studies on such interaction are still insufficient",
    ".    direct observations of local kinematics around mysos would give intrinsic decision for such studies .",
    "if detailed information of the motion of gas in these interactions is available , we can examine the triggering effect quantitatively .",
    "however , observational studies of their kinematics have some serious difficulties .",
    "first , all of mysos are still deeply embedded in the parental molecular clouds because of their rapid evolution .",
    "second , they are usually seen in crowded star clusters .",
    "third , they are far distant from the sun ( @xmath6500@xmath3pc ) . in such deep and crowded massive star forming regions ,",
    "star formation process is complex since several effects , such as stellar winds , radiations and stellar or interstellar magnetic fields , etc , are mixed .",
    "consequently , high angular resolution is essential to resolve into individual effects and local kinematics .",
    "observations of @xmath0 maser emission with a very long baseline interferometre ( vlbi ) is very suitable for such studies . because the maser excitation requires a high density ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) and a temperature ( @xmath9600@xmath3k ) , @xmath0 maser emission in a massive star forming region is usually associated with strong shock front induced by mysos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "each maser source is composed of small gas clumps called maser feature , which has typically a size of 1@xmath3au and line of sight velocity width of a few @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this scale is enough to resolve the spatial and kinematical structure mentioned above .",
    "moreover , extremely high spatial resolution of vlbi obsevations enable us to detect small proper motions of a few milli - arcseconds ( mas ) per year , which reflects the local kinematics projected onto the celestial plane . for these reasons ,",
    "@xmath0 maser emission is a good tracer of three - dimensional kinematics around mysos .",
    "in fact , many vlbi observations have shown highly systematic and directional proper motions of @xmath0 maser features ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which are thought to trace propagation of shock fronts induced by a bipolar outflow , a protosteller wind , or an expansion of ultra - compact ( uc)h*ii * region .    in this paper , we report results of the vlbi observations of @xmath0 maser source wb755 in the massive star forming region _ iras",

    "this value is rather faster than a typical expanding velocity of uch*ii * regions @xcite , although such a bload line width of @xmath0 maser emission is seen in several star forming regions ( e.g. , w49n ; @xcite ) in addition to this , the velocity - coverage is about six times larger than the coverage of doppler velocity .",
    "this difference is possible in the case of a highly inclined outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) rather than a spherically - symmetrical expanding flow . with these reasons ,",
    "this expanding motion seems to trace a bipolar outflow rather than a spherical expansion of uch*ii * region .",
    "this is still indeterminate at this point and our model fitting gives more decision ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "the dynamical time scale of the maser expansion estimated from the relative motions and the spatial distribution of about 1@xmath3is ranged from 10@xmath27 to 10@xmath28 yr .",
    "if their expanding motions trace a expansion of the ionization front , this small ionized region may be extremely young .",
    "+    a velocity gradient of the southern group is especially noteworthy .",
    "the v - wing shows remarkably fast motions ( 90180 km@xmath3s@xmath17 ) at the early epochs , while the h - wing shows relatively slow motions ( 3065 km@xmath3s@xmath17 ) .",
    "of course , this large gradient clearly results in the change of their alignment mentioned above .",
    "there exists steep inverse correlation between relative proper motion and intensity of the features ( fig 4 ) .",
    "this is reasonable , since a feature with larger proper motion has larger internal velocity gradient @xcite , which prevents itself from obtaining coherent length . as a result",
    ", it may has shorter lifetime and weaker intensity .",
    "in fact , averaged intensity of the v - wing is relatively weaker than h - wing at all epochs , and the h - wing seems to be more stable than the v - wing which disappeared in the later epoch .",

    "in fact , several features of the v - wing show strong deceleration as they come down ( see table 3 ) . this difference can not be explained by an internal motion of single gas layer or a geometry of typical gas flow swept - up with a simple bipolar outflow .     in the top ; @xmath30 in the bottom).v - wing shows far steeper inverse correlation than h - wing.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "these two wings show clearly different properties in their proper motion velocities and velocity gradient along the alignment .",
    "but their continuous alignment strongly suggests that they are excited in a single gas layer . with this point of view",
    ", we try to explain these differences with highly clumpy structure of their parental cloud .      as a first step ,",
    "we examine analytical treatment of motion of gas layer with simple plane parallel approximation , where a bipolar outflow strikes a uniform plane of parental cloud and sweeps up the gas into thin layer . in this compressed layer ,",
    "one side is pressed by ram pressure and another side is supported by thermal pressure .",
    "an equation of motion for the gas layer is given by @xmath31 where , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the density , velocity and compressed length of the parental cloud , respectively .",
    "the left side corresponds to time derivation of momentum per unit area of the layer .",
    "the right side of the equation corresponds to the ram pressure of the flow .",
    "we simply assume @xmath34 as constant .",
    "then , equation ( 1 ) is transformed into @xmath35 where , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the number densities of molecular hydrogen in bipolar outflow and the parental cloud , respectively .",
    "@xmath33 is still small in a short time after the interaction , hence we can assume @xmath38 and the equation ( 2 ) directly gives an initial velocity of the layer , @xmath39 this means if the parental cloud has a density gradient , then single layer also has a gradient in an initial velocity .",
    "such a velocity gradient simply affects maser intensity , since maser coherent path naturally increases in the slow part of gas layer , where gas density is likely to be dense , and maser excitation itself directly increases .",
    "consequently , maser features in the slower part of gas layer is thought to show smaller proper - motions , stronger intensity and longer lifetime than the fast part .    because flow is not always perpendicular to gas layer , oblique shock wave is possible to occur .",
    "such shock can bend the motion vector of gas layer , and these interactions can be directly detected as systematic change of radial velocity of features . in the case of",
    "_ iras _ 06061 + 2151 , the v - wing seems to be more red - sifted than the h - wing at the early epochs , on the other hand , several high velocity features were decelerated at the later epochs as mentioned above .",
    "their line of sight velocities are blue - shifted comparable to the h - wing after the deceleration .",
    "this change of velocity vector can be interpreted as the effect of oblique shock .",
    "however , such deceleration itself is also possible to be explained by the increase of compressed length @xmath33 , and the change of line of sight velocity might be an effect of internal motion of feature . in order to distinguish these effects , we need more sensitive observation enough to monitor faint part of thin gas layer .    molecular flow or",
    "protosteller wind is not a steady flow in practice .",
    "some flows or winds have fluctuation , which causes time dependency of its ram pressure .",
    "it is well known that h@xmath40o maser emission in star forming regions generally has strong time variability ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that such variability is influenced by time dependence of ram pressure .",
    "the velocity of gas layer also depends on time in this case .",
    "if relaxation time of interaction is enough shorter than a cycle of fluctuation , a change of ram pressure immediately reflects in motion of compressed gas .",
    "we might be able to detect some correlation between systematic change of velocity and intensity in such a case .",
    "fig 6 shows the schematic view of our interaction model .",
    "denser gas clump is located at the southern side of cloud in this model .",
    "the kink of the arc corresponds to the densest part of clump , while density becomes lower with distance from the kink in the h - wing , as shown by proper - motion velocity gradient . on the other hand",
    ", the v - wing corresponds to diffuse part of cloud and faster than the h - wing , hence , the arc - like alignment is changed to straight - line . in this way , our model has given a reasonable explanation for change of alignment and proper - motion velocity gradient in the h - wing .",
    "if this qualitative explanation is correct , these behaviors of maser gas layer tell us a distribution of a very small and dense gas clump surrounding a massive star forming region . since the difference of proper - motion velocity is up to 5 times in the case of _ iras",
    "_ 06061 + 2151 , corresponding density gradient is estimated to be up to 25 times from equation ( 2 ) .",
    "we discuss about this very clumpy structure in scale of several tens of au in the following subsection 4.1.2 .",
    "maser excitation requires volume density of 10@xmath41@xmath42 .",
    "this density is thought to be achieved by shock propagation . in this case ,",
    "pre - shock density is over 10@xmath43@xmath42 @xcite , which is slightly higher than that of typical molecular cloud core in scale of 0.1@xmath3pc .",
    "such an extremely dense `` bed '' of maser is probably not intrinsic but induced by external effect such as expansion of uch*ii * region .",
    "even more , our result means this `` bed '' is not uniform but extremely clumpy in scale of several tens of au . the lower limit of pre - shock density and the density ratio , which estimated from equation ( 2 ) ,",
    "indicate that the density of clump is order of 10@xmath4410@xmath45@xmath42 .",
    "there are two possibilities about the origin of such a dense and clumpy structure .",
    "one case is due to some external triggering .",
    "previous simulations have shown that several types of instability of ionization front have been able to produce such dense and clumpy `` bed '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these instabilities arise as a result of expansion of uch*ii * region , and induce strong density gradient in surrounding neutral gas layer , which is thought to give effects on evolution of morphology from uch*ii * region to extended uch*ii * region @xcite .",
    "the most dense part becomes over ten times denser than the most diffuse part in these instabilities . besides this",
    ", gravitational instability also arises in shocked gas layer itself @xcite .",
    "all of these instabilities are thought to be mainly caused by anisotropic pressure ( ram , magnetic , etc ) on a shock front ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". however , typical scale of these simulations , which generally intend to study pc - scale structure , is not suitable for our observational scale smaller than 100@xmath3au .",
    "the other case is due to internal cause of self - gravity in the parental cloud core .",
    "if several high density parts are produced in the self - contracting cloud core at the same time on the formation of massive cluster , the parental cloud core have been intrinsically clumpy .",
    "such high density clumps may be formed by splitting of high density core . whether or not , there is no observational result which negates such a dense and small clump .",
    "we fit the maser motions with a our three - dimensional model . from a bipolar - like distribution of maser features ,",
    "we assume typical biconical outflow model ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "all maser features move along the surface of a cone .",
    "in addition , we also assume that the myso is located within the distribution of maser features .",
    "the free parametres in our model fitting are inclination of a cone from the line of sight , position angle on the celestial plane , opening angle , and position of vertex ( i.e. location of myso ) as following @xcite . because of large uncertainty of position error among epochs ,",
    "we also fit position of vertex as the free parametre for each epoch . from equation ( 1 )",
    ", the velocity of the gas layer that includes maser features is clearly related with the swept - up length @xmath33 .",
    "since the density of molecular cloud core in hydrostatic equilibrium generally shows power law distribution , we assume a velocity field on the surface of the cone under the constant or simple ram pressure , which decreases with @xmath33 , as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is distance from the vertex at au scale and index @xmath48 , which we also fit as a free parametre , is changed from -2 to 2 .",
    "the best fit solution is looked for minimizing the @xmath49 given by the sum of the square differences between the model and measured relative motions .",
    "we calculate the @xmath49 from the equation ( a.2 ) in @xcite .",
    "the best fit solution is found to have a large opening angle of 54 .",
    "the cone axis is inclined at 37  from the line of sight and its position angle is 60  east from north .",
    "it is worth noting that this nw - se axis coincides very well with the large scale jet seen in 2.1@xmath5 hydrogen emission @xcite .",
    "the position of the vertex is ( @xmath48,@xmath50)@xmath51 = ( @xmath52 , + 215041.3872 ) .",
    "this position has an offset of 150@xmath3mas from the peak position of the vla continuum source to sw direction , but barely within the error of the absolute coordinates .",
    "this position is completely inside the continuum emission .",
    "the best fit @xmath48 is -1.7 , but , this may be a mean value of each location , because @xmath53 in equation ( 2 ) is also a function of the density of parental clump . hence we need more detailed model , which includes flow - geometry and density gradient of clump , to determine the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath53 .    this large opening angle solution and axis geometry can be interpreted by a dual structure of highly collimated jet and massive , large opening angle molecular outflow .",
    "each types of flow is often observed in massive star forming region ( e.g. , the former in @xcite ; the latter in @xcite ) , and sometimes , they actually co - exist associated with single myso @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that this co - existance can arise among the intermidiate phase on an evolutionary stage of early b - type star or b - type stage of mass accreting early o - type star .",
    "recent mhd simulations also show that such a dual structure can be formed by a combination of acrretion and deflection of infalling matter(e.g . , @xcite ) .",
    "in this case , the maser emission is more likely to be associated with the molecular outflow , since the jet is too collimated to excite the whole of the widely distributed maser features .",
    "in addition to this , the density of such a jet is significantly lower than that of an outflow in these mhd simulations , hence , massive outflow is more suitable than a jet for a maser excitation in terms of mass supply which supports to produce extremely dense gas layer widely .",

    "this length is slightly short to achieve a typical maser cloud density ( 10@xmath41@xmath42 ) with the compression only , but if we take into account a mass conservation of the massive outflow , sufficient mass is provided for a gas layer .",
    "equation ( 5 ) indicates that if molecular flow has a typical velocity of a few tens of @xmath3km@xmath3s@xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , then its density is more than 10@xmath58@xmath42 .",
    "this is the most dense case in the observed massive outflows .",
    "such a molecular flow is , however , has not been detected in this region , yet @xcite .",
    "this may mean the driving source of molecular flow is still compact and deeply embedded in a dense clump , and we can only see an collimated jet which can penetrates surrounding cloud .",
    "@xcite regards their s4 source as the driving source of the jet , because it is thought to be a class * i * b - type protostar which is thoght to form protostellar jet intrinsically and it is also located at the middle of the two knots .",
    "our model fitting , however , suggests that the root of these jet / outflow system is located within the small uch*ii * region , g188.794 + 1.031 ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "in fact , two _ ks_-band sources , s1 and s4 in @xcite , and g188.794 + 1.031 are almost in alignment with the two knots ( see figure 4 in @xcite and also figure 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "but if collimated jet and massive , embeded outflow actually co - exist , s4 seems to be inadequate for their driving source .",
    "because s4 can be seen in near - infrared ( _ ks_-band ) emission , it should not be deeply embeded .",
    "g188.794 + 1.031 is , on the other hand , only seen in 3.6@xmath3 cm continuum and located at the blank of _ ks_-band emission .",
    "this indicates that g188.794 + 1.031 is still deeply embedded and not seen in near - infrared wave - length .",
    "this is consistent with our model mentioned above , and hence , the ionization source of g188.794 + 1.031 is more likely to be the driving source of the jet / outflow system .",
    "we estimate the dynamical time scale of the jet which is a rough measure of the lower limit on the age of driving source .",
    "the jet is traced by two , nw - se , knots seen in 2.1 @xmath59 hydrogen emission which is a good tracer for moderate shocks @xcite .",
    "we assume a moderate shock velocity ( 1030 km@xmath3s@xmath17 ) as a lower limit on the jet velocity , because this is only a terminal velocity after the deceleration on their travel of 0.5 pc ( from end to end ) in dense molecular gas @xcite .",
    "we also assume the largest proper motion of maser features as an initial velocity of the jet , because it is seemed to reflect the molecular outflow velocity which is usually slower than the co - existing collimated jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with these assumption ,",
    "estimatied time scale is ranged from 3.0@xmath210@xmath28 to 1.5@xmath210@xmath60 yr .",
    "the upper limit is not so small value , but it is still smaller than typical lifetime of ultra - compact phase of an ionized region around a massive star ( @xmath910@xmath61yr ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the geometry in _ iras _ 06061 + 2151 suggests that the three sources on the jet axis ( g188.794 + 1.031 , s1 and s4 ) may have some dynamical relation through the jet / outflow system .",
    "we can not estimate the age of these three sources directly , but an absence of associated ionized region is rough measure of their growth .",
    "in addition to this , comparison of a spectral type between these sources give some decision on their formation sequence .",
    "the spectral type of the ionizasion source of g188.794 + 1.031 can be estimated from the excitation parameter which is calculated with 8.4@xmath3ghz continuum emission and equation ( 3 ) in @xcite .",
    "calculated parameter is described as , @xmath62,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where d is a source distance from us and we assumed the electron temperature as 10@xmath63 .",
    "an excitation parameter of 1.92 corresponds to that for a little more massive star than b3-type star @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the ionization source of this small uch*ii * region has lower limit mass that can produce a ionized region ( 7 - 8@xmath64 ) .",
    "in contrast to g188.794 + 1.031 , other two _ ks_-band sources have no overlayed radio counterpart @xcite , and hence , no detectable uch*ii * region is associated with them .",
    "nevertheless , the spectral type of these two _ ks_-band sources , which is estimated from colour - magnitude diagram by @xcite , is b1-b0 type which is enough early to produce an ionized region .",
    "this indicates that these two _ ks_-band sources are more massive than the ionization source of g188.794 + 1.031 which have lower limit mass for an ionization .",
    "if these spectral - type estimation is correct , the absence of any ionized region around these b1-b0 type sources suggests that they are younger than the ionization source of g188.794 + 1.031 , because they should evolve more rapidly than , or at least as rapid as , b3-type source .",
    "taking into account this result , the ionization source of g188.794 + 1.031 seems to be born at first in these three sources . in this case , if the ionizing source actually drives the jet , the formation of two b - type protostars , especially s4 source which adjoins g188.794 + 1.031 , may be affected by the jet / outflow system . in this case",
    ", it can be a good example of sequential star formation in a massive cluster . in order to prove such a sequential process in _ iras",
    "_ 06061 + 2151 quantitatively , we have to determine their geometry more accurately , in particular , the shape and the size of the uch*ii * region and the absolute location of the maser .",
    "we made vlbi observations of h@xmath65o masers in massive star forming region _ iras",
    "_ 06061 + 2151 with jvn from 2005 may to 2007 october .",
    "the h@xmath65o masers are clustered within 1@xmath21  area around extremely young uch*ii * region .",
    "they are divided into several groups based on their radial velocities , and show expanding motions .",
    "their alignment and detected three - dimensional motion indicate they are associated with a bipolar outflow from the source in the uch*ii * region .",
    "the southern blue - shifted group shows an arc - like alignment within several tens of au .",
    "their continuous alignment indicate they are excited in a single gas layer .",
    "they also show two clearly different kinematics , which are the vertical part ( v - wing ) of 90180@xmath3km@xmath3s@xmath17 and the horizontal part ( h - wing ) of 3065@xmath3km@xmath3s@xmath17 .",
    "this may be caused by far small ( several tens of au ) and clumpy ( 10@xmath44@xmath66@xmath42 ) structure of parental cloud core .",
    "such a clumpy structure is expected to be induced by strong instability of shock front ( e.g. , expansion of uch*ii * region ) .",
    "further high - resolution mhd simulation is desirable to examine this effect .",
    "the biconical flow has an opening angle of 54  and the axis along nw - se direction based on our model fitting .",
    "this nw - se axis coincides very well with the large scale jet seen in 2.1@xmath5 hydrogen emission .",
    "these geometry and large opening angle are thought to indicate the dual structure of highly collimated jets and massive and largely opened molecular flow in this region .",
    "we estimate density of the outflow from the deceleration of the v - wing of @xmath910@xmath67@xmath42 , although such a massive outflow has not been detected in this region yet .",
    "this may mean such a flow is still compact and deeply embedded in the dense clump , and we can only see an collimated jet which can penetrates surrounding cloud . in this point of view , we conclude that these two types of flow is associated with the ionizing source of g188.794 + 1.031 .",
    "there are , in addition , two b - type protostars located on the jet axis .",
    "these two sources are seemed to be younger than the ionizing source from the absence of any ionized region and comparison of a spectral type .",
    "this time sequance and their geometry may indicate that the formation of two protostars is affected by the jet and outflow . with additional observations which has higher resolution and accuracy",
    ", they can be a good example of sequential star formation in a massive cluster .",
    "we would like to thank all the member of jvn , vera and hokkaido university to observational support and useful suggestions .",
