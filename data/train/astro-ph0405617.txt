    "the colour  magnitude relation and the luminosity function ( lf ) provide quantitative measures of galaxy evolution .",
    "the colour  magnitude relation , also known as the red sequence , is a general observed characteristic of galaxies in clusters ( e.g. garilli et al .",
    "1996 , stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "the homogeneity in colour of galaxies on the red sequence , both observed across a range of clusters ( ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; andreon 2003a , c ) and within individual systems ( e.g. bower et al .",
    "1992 , stanford et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the apparent passive evolution of cluster elliptical galaxies ( kodama & arimoto 1997 , stanford et al . 1998 ; kodama et al . 1998 ) , all imply that the luminosity  weighted stellar populations within such galaxies are uniformly old ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the colour  magnitude relation constrains the evolution of the reddest cluster galaxies whereas the lf describes the spatial density per unit luminosity interval and its evolution provides an overall measure of the changing cluster galaxy population .",
    "the local ( @xmath8 ) cluster galaxy lf has been derived for large numbers of systems ( garilli , maccagni & andreon 1999 ; paolillo et al .",
    "2001 ; de propris et al . 2003 ) and the evolution of the lf at increasing redshift ( andreon 2004 ) is consistent with predictions based upon passive stellar evolution . near infra  red ( nir ; in this case @xmath9band ) observations have confirmed that the mean cluster galaxy lf continues to evolve passively to redshift unity ( de propris et al .",
    "nir fluxes received from galaxies at redshifts @xmath5 are dominated by rest ",
    "frame emission arising from stellar types g and later .",
    "therefore , although the nir cluster galaxy lf provides a suitable measure of the passive evolution of stellar mass contained in such systems , the lf computed from red optical passbands ( i.e. sampling rest  frame blue emission ) provides a more sensitive measure of active luminosity evolution , i.e. secondary star formation events .",
    "current measures of the optical lf evolution of cluster galaxies at @xmath10 are few ( nelson et al . 2001 ; barrientos & lilly 2003 ) .",
    "the present paper addresses this issue and combines a discussion of lf evolution in cluster galaxies with a simultaneous assessment of the colour  magnitude relation .",
    "data acquisition and reduction is discussed in section 2 .",
    "section 3 presents the colour  magnitude relation , colour distribution and the lf computed for individual clusters .",
    "section 3 also discusses the evolution of the above quantities with redshift .",
    "the main results are presented and discussed in section 4 , i.e. we demonstrate that the cluster galaxy population is consistent with the presence of at least two components : old systems formed at high redshift that have evolved passively from that epoch , together with a galaxy population displaying more recent star formation .",
    "we discuss constraints placed on the evolution of both populations by the current data set .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a friedmann  robertson  walker  lemaitre cosmological model described by the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 kms@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "the cluster sample presented in this paper is drawn from a number of sources and represents a heterogeneous data set .",
    "uniform photometry was obtained for all clusters and details are presented in table 1 .",
    "eighteen clusters were observed as part of the x  ray multi  mirror ( xmm ) large scale structure ( lss ) survey ( pierre et al . 2004 ) which aims to determine the large scale structure of the universe as traced by galaxy clusters , @xmath15 ( j2000 ) . ] .",
    "an additional 5 clusters were added to this sample from the literature .",
    "the majority of the clusters are drawn from x  ray selected samples ; two ( rzcs 001 & cl0412 ) are optically selected , the latter being later x  ray detected .",
    "the nature of the most distant cluster , xlssc 005 , is ambiguous ( valtchanov et al .",
    "although the system displays extended x  ray emission and a concentration of galaxies in redshift space , there are several other galaxies in the cluster surroundings ( @xmath16 ) , suggesting perhaps a more complex structure .",
    "the redshift thickness of this structure is negligible , and therefore neglected within our subsequent analyses .",
    "figure 1 shows the x  ray luminosity in the [ 0.1 - 2.4 ] kev rest  frame band versus redshift for more than 1000 clusters in literature and listed in the x - ray galaxy clusters database ( bax , black dots ) , and for all x  ray detected clusters studied here ( green circles with error bars ) .",
    "the horizontal arrow indicates the characteristic @xmath17 luminosity reported by ebeling et al .",
    "the curve is an adaptively smoothed running median of literature points . the x  ray luminosity of the clusters considered in this paper are typically lower than clusters presented in the literature ( e.g. , mullis et al . 2003 ;",
    "romer et al . 2000 ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) at similar redshift .",
    "in particular , at redshifts @xmath1 , xlssc clusters have x  ray luminosities characteristic of low mass clusters and groups ( willis et al .",
    "this is expected , given the present area coverage and limiting flux of the xmm  lss project ( pierre et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "all clusters presented in this paper ( including the complex structure xlssc 005 ) have at least two concordant redshifts in addition to the presence of an unambiguous galaxy overdensity in multi  colour ccd images .",
    "we note that , though cluster xlssc 007 is confirmed spectroscopically ( willis et al .",
    "2004 ) with at least 10 members , there exists a large ( 1.2 arcminute ) offset between the optical galaxy overdensity and the centroid of the x  ray emission . though the optical cluster is clearly real , the x  ray flux for xlssc 007 will be greatly overestimated should the observed x  ray emission arise from a second cluster along the line of sight .",
    "all clusters presented in this paper have been observed in @xmath18 and/or @xmath19 passbands as detailed in table 1 .",
    "optical @xmath20 and @xmath21band ( @xmath22 ) images were obtained at the cerro tololo inter  american observatory ( ctio ) 4 m blanco telescope during two observing runs , in august 2000 and november 2001 , with the mosaic ii camera .",
    "mosaic ii is a 8k@xmath238k camera with a @xmath24 arcminute field of view .",
    "typical exposure times were 1200 seconds in @xmath20 and @xmath25 seconds in @xmath21 .",
    "seeing in the final images was between 1.0 and 1.4 arcseconds full  width at half  maximum ( fwhm ) in the november 2001 run ( when all clusters except xlssc 006 were observed ) , and 0.9 to 1.0 arcsec fwhm in the august 2000 run ( xlssc 006 observations ) .",
    "the useful nights of the two observing runs were photometric .",
    "images were trimmed and bias corrected .",
    "a flat field correction was applied together with an illumination correction ( where required ) and interference fringes were removed from @xmath21band images . in the data reduction",
    "we employ the flips software package ( cuillandre , in preparation ) . where multiple exposures of the same field were available , cosmic rays were identified and images were combined .",
    "extensive comparisons to landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars , sky regions in the early data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) , and overlapping regions between pointings demonstrated that the photometric zero point is accurate to better 0.03 mag over the entire instrument field of view .",
    "a detailed description of these data reduction techniques will presented in a forthcoming paper presenting optically selected galaxy clusters within the xmm  lss survey ( andreon et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "additional @xmath19band images were obtained at the european southern observatory ( eso ) 8.2 m very large telescope ( vlt ) facility employing the focal reduction spectrograph ( fors2 ) in september 2002 as part of pre  imaging of spectroscopic target fields .",
    "the fors2 instrument consists of two 2k@xmath234k ccds with a field of view of 7@xmath237 arcminutes .",
    "exposure times were either @xmath26 seconds or @xmath27 seconds and observations were performed under photometric sky conditions .",
    "fors2 images were reduced using standard techniques using iraf .",
    "seeing in the final images were @xmath28 arcseconds fwhm .",
    "object magnitudes are quoted in the photometric system of the associated standard stars : @xmath20 and @xmath19 magnitudes are calibrated with landolt ( 1992 ) stars , while @xmath21 magnitudes are calibrated with sdss ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ) standard stars . source detection and characterization",
    "was performed employing sextractor v2 ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "colours are computed within a fixed 1.9 arcsecond radius aperture , whereas magnitudes are computed within an angular aperture of projected size equal to 15.3 kpc radius for objects at the cluster redshift .",
    "a fixed angular aperture is employed to compute object colours , irrespective of the object redshift .",
    "we adopt this approach as only limited spectroscopic information is available within each cluster field . employing a fixed angular aperture translates to a uniform metric aperture for all galaxies located at the cluster redshift .",
    "colours computed within the adopted 1.9 arcsecond aperture are biased by differential seeing effects between the @xmath20 and @xmath21band images .",
    "a bias correction is applied employing bright stars located within each field .",
    "several possible angular radii were considered , and 1.9 arcseconds was selected as a compromise figure that generated acceptable source signal  to  noise ratios together with a small correction for differential seeing effects . the median absolute correction ( over all ctio pointings )",
    "is 0.05 mag and the scatter is 0.05 mag .    a fixed metric aperture , corresponding to a radius of 15.3 kpc at each cluster redshift is employed to determine galaxy photometry for the lf computation .",
    "the particular aperture applicable to each cluster is also applied to galaxies within the control field .",
    "this metric aperture is employed in order to avoid introducing an unnecessary bias associated with the use of non  metric apertures ( dalcanton 1998 ) which can mimic the effect of redshift evolution in the lf .",
    "the value for the aperture radius , 15.3 kpc , permits a consistent comparison between the results of the current study and the lf derived for 65 low redshift ( @xmath29 ) clusters by garilli , maccagni & andreon ( 1999  hereafter gma99 ) , that adopt the same aperture when cast within their adopted cosmological model .    at faint magnitude limits ,",
    "galaxies displaying low central surface brightness values are detected with rapidly decreasing frequency .",
    "aperture magnitude completeness limits have been estimated according to the prescription of garilli , maccagni & andreon ( 1999 ) , andreon et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and andreon & cuillandre ( 2002 ) , by considering the magnitude of the brightest galaxies displaying the lowest detected central surface brightness values .",
    "only galaxies brighter than this completeness limit are considered in this paper .",
    "bright objects ( typically @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , whose compactness computed using the sextractor stellar classifier leads to a relatively unambiguous stellar classification , are discarded from the galaxy sample .",
    "fainter stars are subtracted in a statistical manner following andreon & cuillandre ( 2002 ) .",
    "the statistical nature of this approach avoids incorrectly excluding faint , compact galaxies from the sample .",
    "the control field used in the statistical subtraction procedure is separated from the science fields by no more than one degree and , as observations are performed at high galactic latitudes , star counts within the control field are expected to reproduce those of the science fields .",
    "galaxy clusters have been detected employing a method similar to the red sequence method of gladders & yee ( 2000 ) .",
    "the method employed in this paper differs from the gladders & yee ( 2000 ) approach in several key areas , as described when it was applied ( andreon 2003a , b ) to the sdss early data release ( stoughton et al . 2002 ) . in summary",
    ", the method exploits the observed trend that the majority of galaxies in clusters display similar colours , while non ",
    "cluster galaxies located along the line  of  sight display considerable variation of observed colours , both because they are drawn from a larger interval of redshift and because the field galaxy population at a given redshift displays a larger variation in colour than a typical cluster galaxy population .",
    "the algorithm identifies local galaxy overdensities displaying similar @xmath32 colours , and is considered at several angular scales .",
    "the applied colour filtering effectively removes most of the `` background '' galaxies ( see figure 3 and later discussion ) .",
    "only one cluster ( xlssc 007 ) , of the 25 clusters studied here , is undetected at the @xmath33 confidence level .",
    "the remaining clusters present such sufficiently well  characterised detections that the optical images used to detect each cluster also permit detailed colour and lf studies .",
    "figure 2 displays colour magnitude diagrams constructed for clusters listed in table 1 with @xmath20 and @xmath21band photometry .",
    "two sample distributions are displayed : the first sample ( open points ) consists of galaxies brighter than the completeness limit ( vertical dashed line ) located within a specified radius from the cluster centre .",
    "this radius is specified to optimize the signal to noise ratio of the resulting lf computation .",
    "a radius of 2 arcminutes was adopted for the majority of the clusters .",
    "exceptions to this value include clusters with a large projected extent ( vmf98 34 , vmf98 43 , xlssc 004 , xlssc 014 , xlssc 016 , and xlssc 020 ) , for which a 3 arcminute radius was applied .",
    "in addition , a 1.5 arcminute radius was applied in two cases : xlssc 017  to reduce any contamination from the nearby cluster xlssc 020 ; and xlssc 007  to reduce any effect from an unassociated foreground galaxy located 2 arcminutes from the cluster centre .",
    "the same set of apertures are employed to compute both the cluster colour distributions and the lfs .",
    "an angle of two arcminutes corresponds to a distance of @xmath34 mpc when projected at redshifts @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the red sequence within each cluster is clearly apparent at redshifts @xmath1 , although a comparison of individual clusters demonstrates that their visual appearance varies considerably ( e.g. xlssc 006 compared to vmf98 43 ) .",
    "the red sequence is sampled over an increasingly limited magnitude range with increasing redshift and is more heavely contaminated by background galaxies .",
    "however , the sequence remains clearly identifiable to redshifts @xmath36 .",
    "the red envelope of the red sequence is defined by the reddest ( i.e. larger colour value ) horizontal line displayed in each sub  panel of figure 2 .",
    "the value of the red envelope is derived from the median colour of the three brightest galaxies considered to be viable cluster members , i.e. galaxies that are too blue or too bright to be plausibly at the cluster redshift are discarded .    the second sample of objects displayed in figure 2 consists of a heterogeneous sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts ( valtchanov et al .",
    "2004 ; willis et al .",
    "2004 ; supplemented by ned and private communications for clusters drawn from literature ) , selected with no constraint with respect to @xmath21 magnitude or distance to the defined cluster centre .",
    "a galaxy is defined as a cluster member if lies within three @xmath37 of the centre of the cluster line  of  sight velocity distribution . exceptions to this criterion are clusters lacking a well  defined @xmath37 value ( literature clusters and xlssc 004 ) , for which a value of @xmath38 kms@xmath14 is adopted .",
    "galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts that do not satisfy this criterion are considered interlopers . due to the complex nature of the system",
    "xlssc 005 , we do not include objects with spectroscopic redshifts in the discussion of this system .",
    "the distribution of spectroscopic cluster members ( red points ) coincides with and reinforces the colour  magnitude relation defined by the photometry alone .      the colour distribution of galaxies brighter than the @xmath21band completeness limit within each cluster field is displayed in figure 3 .",
    "in each case , the colour distribution within the cluster radius defined in the previous section is compared to the colour distribution , normalized to the cluster area , of the whole mosaic ii image ( 36 @xmath23 36 square arcminutes ) in which the cluster is observed at redshifts @xmath39 , a significant excess of galaxies is observed toward the cluster field compared to the control field  whether computed over a specific colour interval or integrated over the entire colour distribution .",
    "the excess due to the cluster is sufficiently significant that clusters should be apparent as a spatial overdensity in a @xmath21band catalogue alone . at redshifts @xmath40 ,",
    "the excess of galaxies in colour space due to the cluster compared to the background is only significant within a limited ( red ) colour interval .",
    "these clusters are unlikely to be identified via a galaxy overdensity in a single photometric band , i.e. by neglecting the colour information .",
    "all clusters within the sample display a significant numerical excess over a limited colour interval ( typically @xmath41 mag ) , indicating that clusters may be identified effectively at redshifts @xmath40 by methods that employ colour selection to suppress background galaxy signals ( section 2.3 ) .",
    "all clusters , with the exception of xlssc 007 , were in fact detected in a 3 dimensional space defined by sky position and @xmath32 colour ( table 1 ) .",
    "a local ( @xmath42 ) cluster comparison sample , detected using a preliminary version of the same cluster detection algorithm used in this paper , is shown in figure 1 of andreon ( 2003a ) .",
    "the colour distribution of this local sample is qualitatively quite similar to the one shown in figure 3 .",
    "a detailed study of the evolution of the colour distribution ( i.e. on the butcher  oemler effect ) will be presented in a later study .",
    "the cluster sample presented in this paper is predominantly x  ray selected / detected .",
    "the identification of a red sequence of galaxies associated with each cluster would initially seem at variance with donahue et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who claim that x ",
    "ray clusters presented in their survey do not all display a prominent red sequence .",
    "however , as the latter authors note and gladders & yee ( 2000 ) show , clusters do not require a prominent red sequence to be detected by a methods that search for overdensities of galaxies of similar ( but not identical ) colour .",
    "this refinement of the definition of the red sequence would appear to resolve the apparent contradiction between our finding and donahue et al .",
    "( 2002 ) claim and confirming the recent results by gilbank , bower , castander , & ziegler ( 2003 ) , based on a low ( @xmath43 ) redshift sample .    the clusters presented in this paper display a range of masses ( as determined by either dynamical or x  ray information , or both ) .",
    "in particular , xlssc clusters at @xmath1 display x ",
    "ray luminosities comparable to low richness clusters or groups ( figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore , the detection of galaxy overdensities in the 3space defined by colour and sky location , at the location of extended x  ray sources indicates that such techniques may provide a promising route to confirm the nature of low mass x  ray selected clusters",
    ".    however , colour plus position selection alone does not constrain the extension in redshift of the identified structure .",
    "a filamentary structure of galaxies seen along the line of sight is , without spectroscopic data , hard to distinguish from a cluster and both scenarios can in principle give rise to the  cluster \" detection .",
    "spectroscopic observations of a sample of colour selected structures are therefore required to measure the frequency of each type of structure ( clusters versus non  virialised large ",
    "scale structure ) .",
    "the spectroscopic cluster sample presented in this paper contains a colour selected cluster undetected in x  ray ( rzcs 011 ) .",
    "this system is confirmed spectroscopically and displays a well  defined mean redshift and distribution of rest  frame velocities .",
    "it is , therefore , a cluster in the sense of being a gravitationally bound systems of galaxies , altough undetected in x  rays .",
    "therefore , colour selection techniques provide a method to identify clusters displaying a broad range of x  ray properties , possibly sampling the cluster mass function deeper than x  ray observations . a more complete investigation of the bivariate distribution of optical and x  ray properties of distant clusters await a larger sample .",
    "the evolution of the color of the red sequence , as computed from the median colour of the three brightest galaxies on the red sequence ( figure 2 ) is displayed in figure 4andreon / xidindex.html ] .",
    "the colour error on each data point is estimated to be 0.03 mag , based upon the present estimate of the maximal variation of the photometric ( flux ) calibration across the camera field of view ( section 2 ) .",
    "the three highest redshift clusters are assumed to exhibit a colour error 0.05 mag , due to the lower signal  to  noise ratio of the photometry .",
    "the colour of the red envelope becomes monotonically redder with increasing redshift ( to at least redshifts @xmath44 ) .",
    "several model predictions are indicated in figure 4 : the top ( long dashed ) curve neglects aging of the stellar population .",
    "it is computed assuming a non  evolving 12 gyr old early  type galaxy sed produced using the gissel98 spectral library ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "galaxy colours are computed by convolving the spectrum with the appropriate filter transmission function together with the atmospheric transmission spectrum .",
    "colours are zero  pointed to match the colour of early  type galaxies within the coma cluster  the models of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) are employed for this purpose to avoid uncertainties due to the differences between the filters employed in this paper and those used for coma galaxies by bower , lucey & ellis ( 1992 ) .",
    "the data points are clearly inconsistent with a universe where the oldest stars have the same age at all redshifts , as already shown by kodama et al .",
    "the additional models indicated in figure 4 are more physically motivated .",
    "passive stellar ageing and chemical evolution are incorporated employing the model of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) , that assumes a formation redshift , @xmath45 , and a total stellar mass .",
    "the two solid green curves indicate @xmath46 and a total stellar mass of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the expectation for a mass of @xmath48 and two lower formation redshifts ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) are plotted as dotted and short dashed curves respectively .",
    "the colour of the envelope of the red sequence is reproduced well by models where the oldest stars form at @xmath51 , in good agreement with the findings of stanford et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and kodama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) based on a set of richer clusters located within a comparable redshift range , and with andreon et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) for a sample of low redshift clusters of low optical richness , and also with aragon  salamanca et al . ( 1993 ) for a near  infrared study .",
    "no clusters within the sample , particularly in the redshift range @xmath52 where the colour  magnitude relation is well  sampled by the observations , displays a significant deviation ( i.e. @xmath53 ) from the average trend , i.e. no cluster displays an unusually red or blue colour  magnitude relation for its redshift .",
    "this observation is similar to that noted at @xmath42 in a sample of more than 150 clusters ( andreon 2003a , b ) .",
    "the high formation redshift for red sequence galaxies ( alternatively , the old age of the constituent stellar populations ) , although similar to previous studies , displays a number of important new aspects .",
    "firstly , the observations presented form a very homogeneous data set : all clusters ( with the exception of xlssc 006 ) were observed with the same instrument and filters during a single observing run ( xlssc 006 was observed using the same instrument on the previous run ) . by way of comparison , the cluster samples presented by stanford et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and kodama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) employ a combination of telescopes and photometric passbands .",
    "secondly , the cluster sample is mostly x  ray selected .",
    "the cluster sample is therefore selected in a manner which is independent of ( or assumed to be ) optical properties and avoids a potentially circular analysis between optically selected clusters and the properties of the red sequence .",
    "thirdly , many of the clusters at @xmath52 presented within this paper display x  ray luminosities ( and richness , see section 3.4 ) indicative of low mass or low richness clusters and groups rather than optically rich , massive clusters considered in previous studies ( though c.f .",
    "andreon 2003a , b ) .",
    "low mass structures represent environments with current predictions regarding the assembly of bright , red galaxies ( e.g. kauffmann 1996 and eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) are deemed to display the greatest divergence .",
    "we note that the formation redshift computed for the sample depends in a non  trivial manner upon the assumed stellar population model : adopting a bruzual & charlot ( 1993 , updated to gissel96 ) model of solar metallicity , a salpeter imf and a star formation e  folding time scale @xmath54 gyr , causes the formation redshift that reproduces the colour of the red sequence of the cluster sample to shift from redshifts @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "stanford et al . ( 1998 ) employed gissel96 and reported formation redshifts for early  type galaxies located on the red sequence of @xmath55 .",
    "it is important to note that differences in the cosmological model assumed in this paper and that adopted by both kodama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and stanford et al . (",
    "1998 ) mean that the formation redshifts computed by these authors should be lowered somewhat when compared to the current results .",
    "the presence of colour gradients within cluster galaxies is not expected to alter the conclusions regarding the colour evolution of the red cluster galaxy population .",
    "this assumption holds even in the current situation where the fixed angular aperture employed to measure cluster galaxy colours corresponds to a varying rest  frame aperture projected at the redshift of each cluster .",
    "there are several reasons for this expectation : 1 ) differential colour gradients , @xmath57 , are small ( e.g. 0.02 mag per decade in radius , vader et al .",
    "1988 ) , and the resulting integrated colour gradient @xmath58 displays an even smaller dependence upon radius , 2 ) the applied angular aperture changes by a factor 2 ( 1/5 of a decade ) in the galaxy rest  frame as the galaxy is moved from @xmath59 to @xmath60 and 3 ) the aperture is intrinsically large compared to the visible galaxy extent at all redshifts considered in the sample ( about 30 kpc once seeing effects are considered  see also kodama et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "the cluster lf is computed employing standard techniques ( e.g. oemler 1974 ) , i.e. galaxy counts are compiled from the cluster field and a background galaxy count computed from a control field , suitably normalized to the cluster area , is subtracted .",
    "the effective cluster area is further corrected for the crowding effect due to bright stars where required ( e.g. for cl0412 ) .",
    "errors on the lf data points take into account the increased variance in galaxy counts due to large scale structure variations and follow the huang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) approach .",
    "we note that several literature papers do not take such sources of variance into account , and assume poissonian uncertainties alone .",
    "taking such additional sources of uncertainty into account can give rise to the misleading impression of a lower data quality when compared to quoted uncertainties for literature lfs .",
    "for example , barrientos & lilly ( 2003 ) do not include a term associated with large  scale structure variation in the lf uncertainty . as emphasized by andreon & cuillandre ( 2002 )",
    ", background fluctuations enter into the error budget twice  one contribution from the control field and one from the cluster direction field .",
    "a single mosaic ii pointing contributing to the ctio @xmath61 data set covers a field of 0.36 deg@xmath7 . for clusters located within a given ctio pointing , we employ the area of each pointing",
    "not associated with the particular cluster detection ( typically 0.33 deg@xmath7 ) as the control field .",
    "the cluster area itself is a circle of radius identical to that applied to determine the colour  magnitude relation and the colour histogram ( typically 2 arcminutes radius ) as detailed in section 3.1 .    for clusters observed with vlt / fors2",
    ", a circular aperture of 2 arcminute radius is applied to study the lf .",
    "three exceptions are clusters xlssc 002 , xlssc 003 and xlssc 004 , for which the adopted radius is 1.5 arcminutes .",
    "the choice of the control field for clusters studied employing the vlt data is more complex than the ctio case . at redshifts @xmath62",
    "the apparent angular extent of the cluster is small and the projected cluster galaxy surface density expected at 2.5 arcminutes from the cluster centre is assumed to be negligible .",
    "therefore , for such distant clusters , the area contained within a circular annulus of radius 2.5 to 3 arcminutes is used as a control field . at redshifts",
    "@xmath1 the apparent angular extent of typical clusters contaminate most of the fors2 field of view , making the definition of any cluster ",
    "free control area within the field impossible . for clusters located at redshifts",
    "@xmath1 , we employ the fors2 field of cluster xlssc 005 ( located at @xmath63 ) as the control field .",
    "the decision is motivated by the fact that the brightest member galaxy of xlssc 005 is fainter than the faintest luminosity bin of clusters located at redshifts @xmath64 , i.e. xlssc 005 is too distant to affect the background count level at the magnitudes sampled in lower redshift clusters . for clusters located at redshifts @xmath65 ,",
    "only the faintest magnitude bin is affected by any contribution from the @xmath63 cluster . as an additional test",
