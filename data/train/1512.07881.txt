    "from the inception of equilibrium thermodynamics in the 19th century to the present , a great multidisciplinary effort has been devoted to its extension to far - from - equilibrium situations , some of the most important cornerstones being the development of thermodynamics at the stochastic level @xcite and its extension to the quantum regime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , motivated by the success of quantum information theory and the increasing control in preparation and manipulation of quantum states , the last decade has experienced a growing interest in understanding the thermodynamic implications of quantum features , such as quantum measurement @xcite , coherence @xcite , or quantum correlations @xcite . in this context , inspired by the breakthrough work on the photo - carnot engine driven by quantum fuel proposed by scully _",
    "@xcite , different theoretical studies recently focused on the implications for work extraction introduced by nonequilibrium quantum reservoirs .",
    "in particular it has been shown that using coherent @xcite , correlated @xcite , or squeezed thermal reservoirs @xcite , power and efficiency of heat engines can be improved , even surpassing the carnot bound .",
    "however a general framework providing a deeper understanding of such quantum nonequilibrium phenomena is still an open challenge @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we clarify the role of nonequilibrium quantum reservoirs via the analysis of entropy production , one of the most fundamental concepts in non - equilibrium thermodynamics , which quantifies the degree of irreversibility of a dynamical evolution @xcite . for a quantum system relaxing in a thermal reservoir in equilibrium at inverse temperature @xmath0",
    ", it simply reads @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 $ ] denotes the von neumann entropy of the system and @xmath3 is the heat released from the reservoir .",
    "the positivity of the entropy production is a particular case of the second law .",
    "however , in more general situations , different processes others than heat flows may produce an exchange of entropy between the system and its surroundings , modifying ( [ intro1 ] ) .",
    "we explicitly address such modifications and some of its counter - intuitive consequences for the case of a bosonic mode interacting with a squeezed thermal reservoir , giving a microscopic picture of the dynamical entropy exchange processes .",
    "the maximum irreversible work cyclically extractable from a single squeezed reservoir is obtained .",
    "further , we discuss an otto cycle which can operate as a heat engine converting the heat entering from both reservoirs into work at unit efficiency , or as a refrigerator pumping energy from the cold to the hot reservoir while producing a positive amount of output work at the same time .",
    "our results do not contradict the second law of thermodynamics , which is modified by the inclusion of squeezing as an available resource in the reservoir .",
    "squeezing is intimately related with heisenberg s uncertainty principle , being the reduction of the variance of an observable with respect to the conjugate one @xcite .",
    "nowadays it constitutes a central tool in quantum information with several applications in quantum metrology , computation , cryptography , and imaging @xcite .",
    "most commonly considered squeezed states are coherent , but also thermal ones have been largely studied @xcite .",
    "experimental realizations of squeezed thermal states range from micro - waves @xcite to present squeezing of motional degrees of freedom in optomechanical oscillators @xcite .",
    "consider a quantum system consisting of a single bosonic mode with hamiltonian @xmath4 , weakly dissipating into a bosonic reservoir @xmath5 , prepared in a squeezed thermal state at inverse temperature @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the interaction between mode and reservoir @xmath7 yields an open system dynamics well described by the following lindblad master equation ( lme ) in interaction picture @xcite ( see also appendix [ app : collisional ] ) : @xmath8 where lamb - stark shifts have been neglected .",
    "the two lindblad operators in ( [ master - eq - fieldmode ] ) read @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes the unitary squeezing operator on the system mode @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) $ ] , @xmath15 is the spontaneous emission decay rate and @xmath16 the mean number of photons of frequency @xmath17 in a thermal reservoir at inverse temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the operators @xmath18 , promote jumps associated with the correlated emission and adsorption of photons : @xmath19 , leading to a steady state solution , @xmath20 , no longer diagonal in the @xmath21 basis : @xmath22 with @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the squeezed thermal state @xmath24 has the same entropy as the gibbs state , but increased mean energy .",
    "a crucial property is that its variance in the quadrature @xmath25 has been squeezed by a factor @xmath26 , while the variance of the conjugate quadrature @xmath27 ( @xmath28= i$ ] ) is multiplied by @xmath29 . when turning to the schrdinger picture , the steady state ( [ steady - state ] ) acquires a time - dependent phase which has to be accounted for in applications .",
    "the lme ( [ master - eq - fieldmode ] ) describes relaxation of the mode to @xmath30 , the irreversibility of which is well captured by the so - called excess ( or non - adiabatic ) entropy production rate @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32\\geq 0 $ ] is the quantum relative entropy .",
    "the term @xmath33 $ ] defines the effective rate at which entropy is transferred from the surroundings into the system throughout the non - equilibrium potential , @xmath34 , originally introduced in a classical context @xcite .",
    "the positivity of @xmath35 is always guaranteed for quantum dynamical semigroups @xcite , while the emerging second - law inequality in eq .",
    "( [ excess_entropy ] ) has been recently derived as a corollary from a general fluctuation theorem for a large class of quantum completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) maps @xcite .",
    "the effective entropy flow @xmath36 becomes zero for unital maps and reproduces the heat flow divided by temperature in the case of thermalization or gibbs - preserving maps .",
    "remarkably , in our case it can further be shown that it equals the rate at which entropy decreases in the reservoir along with relaxation ( see appendix [ app : reservoirentropy ] ) . using the steady state @xmath24 in eq .",

    "we obtain that @xmath41 , where the expected value of @xmath42 in the stationary state reads @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the evolution of @xmath44 is rather simple : it increases ( decreases ) exponentially when the interaction with the reservoir induces ( reduces the ) asymmetry in the phase - selected quadratures . as an illustrative example consider an initial state with @xmath45 , but with diagonal elements in the @xmath21 basis as those in @xmath24 . clearly , during its relaxation @xmath46 , while @xmath47 ( see details in appendix [ app : equations ] ) , the uncertainty in @xmath48 being reduced with respect to the one in @xmath27 at constant energy until the steady state is reached . in this case , according to , @xmath49 , meaning that entropy is transferred from the system to the reservoir , indeed overcoming the entropy produced in the process , @xmath50 , which corresponds a net reduction in the system local entropy @xmath51 .",

    "as a first consequence of reservoir squeezing , we point out the possibility of cyclic work extraction from a single reservoir . this operation is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics in the thermal reservoir case .",
    "nevertheless it becomes possible when including extra sources of coherence @xcite , neg - entropy @xcite , or additional information reservoirs @xcite .",

    "this fact can be understood from a simple argument : as long as the mode state before the isentropic stroke , say @xmath240 , is fixed by the previous thermalization step , we have that the work extracted in the process , @xmath241 - { { \\rm tr}}[\\hat{h}_{\\rm f } \\hat{\\rho}_{\\rm f}]$ ] , is minimized when @xmath242 ( the state after modulation ) has minimum energy for a fixed entropy .",

    "[ sec : engine ] .",
    "the non - equilibrium free energy is a powerful concept in non - equilibrium thermodynamics and specifically in thermodynamics of information @xcite .",
    "it is defined as a property of a system in some arbitrary state @xmath258 with hamiltonian @xmath259 , with respect to a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath260 , as @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the von neumann entropy of the system state for the quantum case .",
    "the most important property of the non - equilibrium free - energy is that its variation measure the maximum work which can be extracted when letting the system equilibrate to temperature @xmath260 in an intelligent way @xcite .    in order to apply this concept in our situation",
    "we proceed by using the fact that the entropy transfer between system and reservoir equals ( minus ) the entropy change in the squeezed reservoir during the corresponding relaxation stroke of the otto cycle , @xmath263 , as we showed in appendix [ app : reservoirentropy ] . when this point is combined with the first law in the cycle , @xmath264",
    ", we can rewrite the second law inequality in eq .",
    "( [ second_law ] ) as @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the loss of ( non - equilibrium ) free - energy in the hot squeezed thermal reservoir in a cycle , with respect to the cold thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath267 .",
    "furthermore this free - energy change can be decomposed into two separate contributions by using the explicit expression of the entropy flow , eq .",
    "( [ entropy_flux ] ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermo ] : @xmath268 the two terms correspond respectively to the free - energy available as a consequence of the temperature gradient between two thermal reservoirs ( first term ) , and the one provided by the non - equilibrium squeezing effects ( second term ) .",
    "the first term is always positive when @xmath269 , meaning that free - energy is available from the spontaneous flux of heat from a hot reservoir to a colder one .",
    "the second term , purely due to squeezing in the reservoir , is instead positive when squeezing is present , @xmath270 , and the following inequality is verified : @xmath271 this implies that the entropic flux of second - order coherences from the squeezed thermal reservoir [ see eq .",
    "( [ extra - entropy ] ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermo ] ] , acts as an independent source of free - energy when the above inequality is fulfilled , increasing the work that can be extracted in the cycle .",
    "furthermore it can be positive even if @xmath272 , and compensate the thermal term ( which in this case would be negative ) , in order to enable work extraction , as is the case of _ region iii _ of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "we build on the single trapped - ion otto cycle proposed in ref .  @xcite and successfully experimentally realized in ref .  @xcite only recently . there",
    ", a trapped ion in a tapered paul trap is subjected to adiabatic frequency modulations for the isentropic strokes of the cycle .",
    "the thermalization strokes are implemented by laser cooling with variable detuning ( and thus final temperature ) .",
    "the same authors proposed theoretically to enhance the cycle by having a hot bath which is squeezed @xcite , finding an increase of the efficiency at maximum power . the squeezed hot reservoir was effectively implemented by having the ion thermalize ( the hot reservoir does laser cooling ) and then squeezing it , resulting in a final thermal squeezed state ( as if the bath were squeezed ) .",
    "such squeezing operation consists of quenching the ion frequency from @xmath17 to @xmath273 `` for a quarter of the oscillation period '' , then to @xmath274 `` for another quarter , before it is returned to its initial value '' @xmath17 ( notice that the authors @xcite are talking about periods of different duration , since the frequency of oscillations differ by @xmath275 , and this has be to be carefully accounted for in the experiment ) .",
    "this operation can be easily understood from fig .  1 in ref",
    ".  @xcite , by noting that suddenly increasing ( decreasing ) the frequency squeezes ( stretches ) the @xmath276 variance , while at constant frequency the wigner function just rotates at that frequency .",
    "finally , the authors propose to output the work of the cycle ( done in the radial coordinate of the ion ) into the axial coordinate ( the two motions are coupled due to the tapered geometry of the trap ) . in this sense",
    ", the engine does work on the axial motion and the working substance is the radial motion .    in our cycle",
    ", we are adding an extra step which tries to profit from the squeezing absorbed from the hot reservoir to produce work . in terms of operations",
    "we could just use the described proposal for the @xmath277 branch ( operation @xmath92 in sec .",
    "[ sec : enginea ] ) , by just reversing the modulation , which would remove the squeezing from the system . in this way , though , the work would be wasted into the frequency quencher ( the electronics of the experiment ) . in order to profit from the squeezing absorbed from the reservoir",
    ", we should be able to transfer it to some fruitful target .",
    "one possibility is to wait for the axial - radial coupling to exchange the squeezing in the radial direction ( so the axial component absorbs all energy from the radial one ) .",
    "the detailed dynamics should be studied thoroughly to check for limitations , though . another possibility , though seemingly involved , would be to transfer this squeezing to an optical mode . this process has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where three electronic levels of an ion trapped inside a cavity would be used to transfer the motional squeezing to light squeezing of the cavity mode .",
    "a fiber collecting the output light from the cavity could be used to transfer this squeezing to the target .",
