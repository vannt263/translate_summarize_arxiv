    "during the last decades significant efforts have been made to investigate the thermophysical properties of dense plasmas . the importance of this activity is mainly connected with the creation of new experimental facilities .",
    "powerful current generators and ultrashort lasers are used for production of very high pressures which can not be reached in traditional explosive devices and light - gas guns .",
    "such experiments give valuable information about various properties of strongly coupled plasmas .",
    "this allows one to obtain a wide - range equation of state and to verify various theoretical approaches and numerical methods . on the other hand these results are of fundamental interest also for various astrophysics and solid state physics applications .",
    "here we report new results on thermodynamic properties and electrical conductivity of dense hydrogen and deuterium .",
    "thermodynamics is calculated by two approaches : the remc method @xcite and the pimc approach @xcite .",
    "main attention is paid to the region of hypothetical plasma phase transition ( ppt ) .",
    "we also make a comparison with recent experimental results on the quasi - isentropic compression of deuterium .    to calculate the electrical conductivity we use quantum dynamics in the wigner representation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the wigner - liouville equation is solved by a combination of molecular dynamics ( md ) and mc methods .",
    "the initial conditions are obtained using pimc which yields thermodynamic quantities such as the internal energy , pressure and pair distribution functions in a wide range of density and temperature . to study the influence of the coulomb interaction on the dynamic properties of dense plasmas",
    "we apply the quantum dynamics in the canonical ensemble at finite temperature and compute temporal momentum - momentum correlation functions and their frequency - domain fourier transforms .",
    "we discovered that these quantities strongly depend on the plasma coupling parameter . for low density and high temperature our numerical results",
    "agree well with the drude approximation and silin s formula @xcite , but with increasing coupling parameter deviations grow .",
    "a complete description of the remc method can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we consider only molecular hydrogen dissociation and recombination : @xmath0 .",
    "ionization can be neglected at temperatures lower than the hydrogen ground state energy ( @xmath1  ev ) and at moderate densities .",
    "the effective pair potentials between different particle species are approximated by buckingham - exp6 potentials , corrected at small distances @xcite .",
    "our remc simulations have been performed in the canonical ensemble for hydrogen and deuterium .",
    "we use 3 types of mc moves : particle displacement , molecular dissociation into atoms and recombination to a molecule .",
    "the expressions for probabilities of the two last moves are given by the internal partition functions of atoms and molecules @xmath2 , @xmath3 . all electrons ( in atoms and molecules ) are assumed to be in the ground state .",
    "further , @xmath2 contains only translational degrees of freedom , @xmath3 contains , in addition rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom . for the latter we numerically solve the schrdinger equation in the central - symmetric field , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which yields the energy levels @xmath4 .",
    "the pimc method allows for first - principle simulations of dense plasmas at arbitrary coupling and up to moderate degeneracy parameters , for details on our method , see @xcite .",
    "it has been used for calculation of thermodynamic properties of hydrogen and hydrogen - helium plasmas and electron - hole plasma in semiconductors .",
    "finally , we briefly describe our quantum dynamics ( qmd ) simulations of the conductivity .",
    "our starting point is the canonical ensemble - averaged time correlation function @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are operators of arbitrary observables and @xmath8 is the hamiltonian of the system which is the sum of the kinetic @xmath9 and the potential @xmath10 energy operators and the complex time is @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the partition function .",
    "the wigner representation of ( [ cfa ] ) in a @xmath14dimensional space is @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 comprise the momenta and coordinates , respectively , of all particles . @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote weyl s symbols of the operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the spectral density expressed as @xmath23    as has been proved in @xcite , @xmath24 obeys the following integral equation : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the initial condition equation , which can be presented in the form of a finite difference approximation of the feynman path integral  @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath24 has to be generalized to account for the spin effects .",
    "this gives rise to an additional spin part of the initial density matrix , e.g. @xcite . also , to improve the simulation accuracy the pair interactions @xmath27 ,",
    "are replaced by an effective quantum potential @xmath28 , such as the kelbg potential  @xcite . for details",
    "we refer to refs.@xcite , for recent applications of the pimc approach to correlated coulomb systems , cf .",

    "thus the time correlation function becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 and the parentheses @xmath39 denote integration over the phase space @xmath40 .",
    "the iteration series for @xmath41 can be efficiently computed using mc methods .",
    "we have developed a mc scheme which provides domain sampling of the terms giving the main contribution to the iteration series , cf .",
    "@xcite . for simplicity , in this work , we take into account only the first term of iteration series , which is related to the propagation of the initial quantum distribution @xmath42 according to the hamiltonian equations of motion .",
    "this term , however , does not describe pure classical dynamics but accounts for quantum effects @xcite and , in fact , contains arbitrarily high powers of the planck s constant .",

    "the chemical potentials @xmath45 of each component are obtained with the the test particle method @xcite : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the ideal gas chemical potential : @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the de broglie wavelength of a particle .",

    "the test particle is then inserted randomly into some point in the allowed intervals and the change in configurational energy @xmath54 is evaluated .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is the possibility of calculation of chemical potentials at high densities , where the usual test particle method tends to fail .",
    "the chemical potentials are calculated separately for atoms and molecules .",
    "the isentrope can also be calculated by using zeldovich s method @xcite . from the first law of thermodynamics",
    "the characteristic equation for the temperature along the isentrope can be derived : @xmath55 we integrate this equation with the initial condition corresponding to an experimental point at low pressure taking the temperature at this point to be close to that from the widom s test particle method . the coefficient @xmath56 is obtained from the interpolation functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which are constructed from the remc calculation on the grid of isotherms and isochores covering the experimental isentrope .",

    "averaging of 20 blocks was used to calculate the statistical error , which did not exceeded @xmath63 for pressure and energy .",
    "the results for three shock hugoniots of gaseous deuterium with three different initial densities ( @xmath64  g/@xmath65 , @xmath66  gpa ; @xmath67  g/@xmath65 , @xmath68  gpa ; @xmath69  g/@xmath65 , @xmath70  gpa ) obtained by remc and dpimc methods can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
