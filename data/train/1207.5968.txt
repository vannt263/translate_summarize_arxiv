    "almost any realistic physical system interacts with its environment .",
    "the effects of this interaction can be described within the framework of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the coupling of a quantum system to an environment typically leads to dissipation and decoherence processes in the open system .",
    "however , it is known that due to the interaction , non - markovian effects can emerge as well . following the classical definition @xcite , quantum non - markovianity",
    "is often loosely described as the occurrence of memory effects in which the environment acts as a memory allowing the earlier open system states to have an effect on the later dynamics of the system .",
    "it is known that non - markovian effects can play an important role in many applications @xcite , but the absence of a proper definition of non - markovianity in the quantum case impeded systematic studies of these effects .",
    "recently , several formal definitions for quantum non - markovianity @xcite , which are based on different mathematical and physical concepts , have been proposed .    here",
    ", we employ the definition developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the exchange of information between the system and its environment and enables a unique quantification of the size of quantum memory effects in the dynamics of a quantum system .",
    "we will study the behavior of this measure for a selected example : the spin - boson model , which is the paradigm of a dissipative two - level system @xcite .",
    "the spin - boson model has been studied extensively over the past decades and has been successfully used to describe , e.g. , chemical reactions , especially charge transfer processes in the condensed phase @xcite , tunneling of defects and impurities in solids and metals @xcite , and tunneling in amorphous materials @xcite .",
    "also , the famous kondo problem @xcite could be linked to the spin - boson model @xcite , which led to the explanation for the kondo effect @xcite .",
    "further , the dynamics of magnetic flux trapped in a squid ring has also been understood with the help of this model and , based on this setup , quantum computing devices have been proposed and partially implemented @xcite . the pursuit of the experimental realization of stable and controllable qubits has become highly important , and it is thus not surprising that quantum dots made of semiconductors have also been investigated as possible qubit implementations @xcite .",
    "such quantum dots and their dissipative interaction with the surrounding components are often described by the spin - boson model .",
    "another very promising approach to quantum computation lies in trapped ions @xcite , as these systems allow for a very high degree of control and long qubit lifetimes @xcite .",
    "again , the spin - boson model is a key tool to a theoretical understanding of the important effects @xcite .",
    "it is not only interesting to characterize memory effects in this prototypical example , but an important motivation for the present study also lies in the need for a better understanding and characterization of the properties of the non - markovianity measure itself , especially for more complex physical systems .",
    "there are several publications studying this quantity in more detail @xcite , applying it to physical models @xcite , and comparing it to other measures @xcite .",
    "additionally , several experimental measurements of the non - markovianity measure have been carried out recently @xcite , demonstrating that it provides an experimentally accessible observable which quantifies memory effects .",
    "quite recently further theoretical implications and experimental applications to nonlocal quantum memory effects have been developed @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : quant ] we briefly present the non - markovianity measure of ref .",
    "@xcite , introduce the spin - boson model and the corresponding second - order time - convolutionless master equation , and explain the numerical simulation method used to determine the measure for quantum non - markovianity .",
    "the numerical simulation results are discussed and linked to a theoretical interpretation in sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , where we also revisit the role of the standard markov approximation ( which is not used in sec .",
    "[ sec : quant ] ) . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we summarize our results and draw some conclusions .",
    "we quantify memory effects in the dynamics of the spin - boson system , employing a recently proposed general measure for the degree of non - markovian behavior in the evolution of an open quantum system @xcite .",
    "this measure is based on the idea that markovian time evolutions are characterized by a continuous loss of information from the open system to the environment , while non - markovian dynamics feature a flow of information from the environment back to the open system .",
    "an appropriate tool to measure this information flow is given by the trace distance between two quantum states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which is defined by @xcite @xmath2 where the modulus of an operator @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 .",
    "the trace distance can be interpreted as the distinguishability of the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the dynamics of the open system is described by a family of trace preserving and completely positive maps @xmath5 .",
    "any pair of initial states @xmath6 then evolves into @xmath7 at time @xmath8 .",
    "if the family of maps @xmath5 is divisible , e.g. , if it forms a semigroup with a generator in lindblad form @xcite , the trace distance @xmath9 between the time - dependent pair of states decreases monotonically @xcite .",
    "this implies that the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 tend to become less and less distinguishable over time , which means that information about the system states is lost to the environment . on the other hand , whenever the trace distance increases , the two states become more distinguishable , and hence , information must have flowed back from the environment to the system , which is a clear signature for the presence of memory effects .",
    "on the basis of this interpretation , the measure for the non - markovianity of the dynamics of an open system is defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the rate of change of the trace distance given by eq .   and",
    "the time integration is extended over all intervals in which @xmath12 is positive .",
    "the measure , thus , quantifies the total backflow of information from the environment to the open system .",
    "it further involves a maximization over the initial pair of states @xmath6 and therefore represents a functional of the family of dynamical maps @xmath5 describing the physical process .    by definition ,",
    "the measure @xmath13 is non - negative , and we have @xmath14 if and only if the process is markovian . a nonzero measure , @xmath15 , implies that the process @xmath5 is nondivisible and can not be described , for example , by a time - local master equation with positive rates @xcite .",
    "we note that the non - markovianity measure @xmath13 represents a physically measurable quantity , as has been demonstrated in several recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the spin - boson model describes a two - level system which is linearly coupled to an environment of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model consists of a system part @xmath16 , an environmental part @xmath17 , and an interaction part @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are pauli matrices , @xmath22 denotes the energy splitting of the two - level system ( @xmath23 is set equal to 1 ) , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 represent the masses , frequencies , and position and momentum operators of the environmental oscillators , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath28 describes the coupling of the system to the @xmath29-th oscillator .",
    "we assume that the system - environment coupling is weak and employ the second - order time - convolutionless master equation in the interaction picture to describe the dynamics of the open system @xcite , @xmath30 \\\\    & & + \\sum_{i , j=0,1 } a_{ij}(t )     \\left ( \\sigma_i \\rho(t ) \\sigma_j^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2 }     \\left\\ { \\sigma_j^\\dagger \\sigma_i , \\rho(t)\\right\\}\\right ) .",

    "we have carried out numerical simulations to determine the non - markovianity measure for the spin - boson model .",
    "for any given pair of initial states @xmath6 , represented by the corresponding bloch vectors @xmath55 , one first solves the bloch equations to determine the behavior of the trace distance by means of @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the euclidean distance .",

    "the measure is then found by maximizing @xmath63 over all pairs of initial states .",
    "we have realized this maximization procedure numerically by a monte carlo sampling , drawing independent random initial state pairs from a uniform distribution over the state space .",
    "our goal is to study the behavior of the non - markovianity as a function of parameters of the environment , namely , the temperature @xmath64 and the cutoff frequency @xmath53 in the spectral density . to this end",
    ", we numerically estimate the measure @xmath13 according to the above procedure for different values of these parameters . the result is a full characterization of the non - markovian behavior in the spin - boson model depending on the properties of its environment depicted in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : nmzoom ] . for each of these points ,",
    "the monte carlo simulation to approximate the maximization over all state pairs has been done with 12000 random initial state pairs .",

    "figure [ fig : nm ] shows the non - markovianity defined by eq .   as a function of temperature @xmath64 and environmental cutoff frequency @xmath53 .",
    "note that the values of the measure @xmath13 are represented by a logarithmic colorbar for better visualization . based on this plot",
    ", one can decide for which parameters the system behaves markovian and for which it exhibits strong non - markovian effects .",
    "we observe that , roughly speaking , for small cutoffs @xmath68 and for small temperatures @xmath69 the dynamics is strongly non - markovian , as can be seen from the high values of the measure @xmath13 in these regions .",
    "by contrast , for large values of both @xmath53 and @xmath64 , the measure is zero and the dynamics is markovian , in full agreement with the well - known quantum optical limit @xcite .",
    "our simulation results show that the non - markovianity measure @xmath13 features a characteristic structure : it exhibits a distinct minimum , i.e. , a markovian area within a non - markovian regime for certain values of temperature and cutoff .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmzoom ] which shows a magnification of the range @xmath70 obtained from a numerical simulation with higher resolution . in the following we",
    "develop a physical interpretation for this feature which obviously depends on the temperature and the cutoff frequency so that it can not be explained by looking at the spectral density @xmath71 only .",
    "the position of the minimum can be extracted from the monte carlo simulation data and the dependence is found to be nonlinear , contrary to first the impression .",
    "the environmental modes enter the master equation via the correlation functions in eqs .  , , and .",
    "in particular , the coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the master equation depend on the noise kernel @xmath48 given in eq .",
    ", which is determined by the effective spectral density @xmath74 where @xmath50 is defined by eq .  .",
    "the spectral distribution @xmath75 depends on three parameters : the environmental mode frequency @xmath76 , the cutoff frequency @xmath53 , and the temperature @xmath64 .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath75 , regarded as a function of @xmath76 , has exactly one maximum at some frequency @xmath77 and the dominant environmental modes are located around this frequency value . under the resonance condition @xmath78",
    "the open system sees an environmental power spectrum , which is approximately constant around its transition frequency @xmath22 , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : jeff ] .     for a fixed cutoff @xmath79 and three different values of temperature @xmath64 .",
    "the middle curve ( @xmath80 ) shows the spectral density obtained from the resonance condition ; the other two curves correspond to detuned temperature values .",
    "the vertical line indicates the system s transition frequency @xmath22 .",
    "the bottom plot shows a magnification of the top plot . ]    in the neighborhood of the transition frequency of the system the spectral distribution is , thus , similar to the spectrum of white noise , and we , therefore , expect to find the region of predominantly markovian behavior from the condition @xmath81 this equation defines a curve @xmath82 in the @xmath83 plane representing the points at which the system s transition frequency @xmath22 is exactly in resonance with the maximum of the effective spectral density .",
    "hence , the region of markovian behavior should be located around this curve .",
    "to test this prediction we use eq .   to obtain the following resonance condition : @xmath84 this function is shown as a white curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : nmzoom ] . by comparison with the dark region in the figure , representing the region of very low or even zero non - markovianity measure @xmath13",
    ", we see that the resonance condition indeed explains very well the emergence of markovian behavior embedded in a region of large non - markovianity .",
    "we note that this picture corresponds to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the damped jaynes - cummings model , describing the interaction of a two - level system with a damped cavity mode , has been studied . for this model",
    "the non - markovianity measure , considered as a function of the detuning between the system transition frequency and the frequency of the cavity mode , shows an analogous behavior , expressing markovian behavior for sufficiently small detuning and a transition to non - markovian dynamics above a certain threshold .      the master equation can be derived by employing only the born approximation , which presupposes a weak system - environment coupling .",
    "the conventional markov approximation consists of neglecting the time - dependence of the coefficients of the master equation @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath85 and taking their asymptotic values for @xmath86 ( stationary rate approximation ) .",
    "the resulting equation is also known as the redfield master equation @xcite .",
    "it provides an equation of motion with a time - independent generator which is not in lindblad form and , hence , does not yield a completely positive quantum dynamical semigroup .",
    "however , for many physical problems the redfield equation has been shown to provide a useful and accurate approximation of the reduced open system dynamics .     as a function of @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath64 up to @xmath67 for the master equation with stationary rates ( redfield equation ) . ]",
    "we have carried out numerical simulations to determine the non - markovianity measure @xmath13 under the stationary rate approximation leading to the redfield equation .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmstat ] .",
    "quite remarkably , the dynamics generated by the redfield equation is still strongly non - markovian in a large parameter region . actually , comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : nmstat ] and [ fig : nmzoom ] we observe that the overall behavior of the non - markovianity measure is qualitatively and even quantitatively very similar to the case without stationary rate approximation .",
    "thus , we conclude that the stationary rate approximation , which is conventionally regarded as the markov approximation , does not lead to a quantum markov process in the sense of the definition for non - markovianity used here .",
    "in this article we have quantified non - markovian effects in the dynamics of the spin - boson model depending on properties of the environment .",
    "we have characterized the non - markovianity of the dynamical map as a function of the temperature and the cutoff frequency in the spectral density .",
    "this result serves to classify different regimes in the parameter range . on the one hand",
    ", we can understand why the predictions of a lindblad master equation fail in some applications , and , on the other hand , our findings may be used as a tool to devise experimental setups that feature especially large non - markovian effects .    during the maximization over all initial state pairs for the evaluation of the non - markovianity measure",
    ", we found that the main contribution to the measure stems from the time evolution of the off - diagonal elements of the system density matrix , i.e. , the coherences .",
    "this fact suggests that at least in our case , the non - markovianity is mainly a quantum effect .",
    "consequently , a description by means of a classical rate equation might fail to reproduce important memory effects .",
    "it is often believed that non - markovianity is to a large extent only a transient phenomenon .",
    "however , our comparison of the results for the non - markovianity measure applied to the full master equation with those for the master equation with stationary rate approximation ( redfield master equation ) reveals that this intuition might be misleading : although the initial oscillations of the coefficients in the master equation decay over times which are short compared to the system s relaxation time , the non - markovianity measure steadily builds up over the whole relaxation process , showing no special significance of the transient time evolution .",
    "consequently , this approximation yields qualitatively similar results for the measure , despite the fact that it neglects any transient effects .    in this context , the meaning of the standard markov approximation must be revisited .",
    "the approximation of stationary rates in the master equation is often regarded as markovian description and the rates are called markovian rates .",
    "however , our results demonstrate that an approximation of this kind does not necessarily lead to a markovian dynamics in the sense of our definition in terms of the information flow .",
    "in fact , we found that the master equation with stationary rates is still capable of describing the essential features of the non - markovian behavior .",
    "it should also be noticed in this context that in the derivation of a lindblad master equation the rotating wave approximation is a crucial step in order to obtain a completely positive quantum dynamical semigroup .",
    "thus , it is the combination of rotating wave and standard markov approximation that has the desired effect of yielding a markovian semigroup ; the term _ markov approximation _ can in this sense be deceptive .    the dynamics given by the master equation without the rotating wave and stationary rate approximations not only shows strong non - markovian behavior for small temperatures and/or environmental cutoff frequencies , but also features an interesting resonance effect : for a certain narrow range of parameters within the non - markovian regime , the system exhibits markovian dynamics .",
    "we were able to explain this effect by showing that this markovian behavior occurs when the system transition frequency is in ( or close to ) resonance with the dominant modes of the environment .",
    "this can be understood by recognizing that in this case the distribution of modes in the vicinity of the system frequency resembles a uniform distribution ( white noise ) , which clearly favors markovian behavior .",
    "the next step towards a deeper understanding of the resonance effect is to study the behavior of the non - markovianity measure for other models involving , in particular , structured reservoir spectral densities with several maxima or spectral gaps .",

    "<S> employing a recently proposed measure for quantum non - markovianity , we carry out a systematic study of the size of memory effects in the spin - boson model for a large region of temperature and frequency cutoff parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the open system is described utilizing a second - order time - convolutionless master equation without the markov or rotating wave approximations . </S>",
    "<S> while the dynamics is found to be strongly non - markovian for low temperatures and cutoffs , in general , we observe a special regime favoring markovian behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is explained as resulting from a resonance between the system s transition frequency and the frequencies of the dominant environmental modes . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate that the corresponding redfield equation is capable of reproducing the characteristic features of the non - markovian quantum behavior of the model . </S>"
