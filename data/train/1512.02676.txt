    "during last two decades the experimental studies of phase transitions in finite and even in small systems are inspiring the high interest to their rigorous theoretical treatment @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons for such an interest is that the nuclear systems which are experimentally studied at intermediate @xcite and at high @xcite collision energies have no thermodynamic limit due to the presence of the long range coulomb interaction and , hence , in a strict thermodynamical sense the phase transition in such systems is not defined .",
    "therefore , the practical need to formulate the reliable experimental signals of phase transformations in the systems consisting of a few hundreds or thousands particles lead researchers to development of the non - traditional statistical methods which may be suited to small systems @xcite",
    ". one of such directions of research , the concept of bimodality , is based on the old t. l. hill idea @xcite that in finite system the interface between two pure phases  costs \" additional free energy and , hence , their coexistence is suppressed .",
    "the practical conclusion coming out of this idea is that the resulting distribution of the order parameter should demonstrate a bimodal behavior and , hence , each maximum or peak of the bimodal distribution has to be associated with the pure phase @xcite .",
    "although in @xcite the authors claimed to establish the one - to - one correspondence between the bimodal structure of specially constructed partition of some measurable quantity , known on average , and the properties of the lee - yang zeros @xcite of this partition in the complex plane of fugacity of this measurable quantity , there appeared certain doubts @xcite about so strict relation between the bimodal - like mass / charge distributions of nuclear fragments and the liquid - gas nuclear phase transition in finite systems . in particular , the doubts follow from the experimental analysis of high momentum decay channels in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite and from the exact analytical solutions of the simplified statistical multifragmentation model @xcite found for finite @xcite and infinite @xcite volumes .",
    "two explicit counterexamples suggest that the bimodal mass distribution of nuclear fragments appears in a finite volume analog of gaseous phase @xcite with positive surface tension and that it can also occur in the thermodynamic limit at supercritical temperatures @xcite , if at such temperatures there exists negative surface tension .    despite the existing counterexamples @xcite , up to now it is unclear , whether the statistical systems without phase transition can , in principle , generate the bimodal size distributions of their constituents for finite volumes . in order to demonstrate that this is , indeed",
    ", the case and the statistical systems in finite volume can generate the bimodal size distributions , here we analytically calculate the size distribution of geometrical spin clusters of the simplest statistical model which has no phase transition , the one dimensional ising model @xcite .",
    "another principal purpose of this work is to further develop connections between the spin models and cluster models .",
    "the cluster models are successfully applied to study phase transitions in simple liquids @xcite , in nuclear matter @xcite and in the quark - gluon plasma phenomenology @xcite .",
    "their basic assumption is that the properties of studied system consisting from the elementary degrees of freedom ( molecules , nucleons , partons , etc . )",
    "can be successfully described in terms of physical clusters ( vapor droplets , nucleus , hadrons , etc . )",
    "formed by any natural number of the elementary degrees of freedom . since the cluster models proved to be a successful tool to investigate the phase transition mechanisms both in finite and in infinite systems",
    ", it seems that the development of equivalent cluster formulation for the well - known spin models and the determination of the properties of their physical clusters is a theoretical task of high priority .",
    "it is necessary to mention that some results on such a connection were already reported in @xcite , in which a parameterization of the fisher liquid droplet model @xcite was successfully applied to the numerical description of cluster multiplicities of two- and three - dimensional ising model .",
    "however , below we implement this program to the one dimensional ising model and directly calculate the size distribution of the geometrical spin clusters from the corresponding partition function .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we explain the necessary mathematical aspects of calculating the spin cluster size distribution . then , in sect .",
    "3 the derived expression is analyzed in details and the physical origin of bimodality in the present model is discussed .",
    "the results of our numerical simulations are also presented in this section .",
    "finally , our conclusions and perspectives of further research are summarized in sect .",
    "here we use the geometrical definition of clusters which seems to be the most natural for lattice models . within this framework the monomers , the dimers , the trimers and so on are built from the neighboring spins of the same direction .",
    "this approach is useful for different lattice systems @xcite .",
    "a high level of its generality allows one to study the su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge lattice models in terms of the clusters composed from the polyakov loops @xcite .",
    "let s consider the one dimensional ising model in which spins are arranged in a linear lattice of size @xmath2 and they can be in two states only ( up or down ) .",
    "interaction energy of two neighboring spins is proportional to their product .",
    "hence , the neighboring pair of parallel spins contribute @xmath3 to the total energy of the system , whereas the corresponding contribution of the neighboring pair of antiparallel spins is @xmath4 . for a convenience",
    "we choose the following boundary conditions : two edge spins have only a single neighbor which is able to interact with them .",
    "evidently , in the present model there are only two types of clusters , i.e. the clusters composed of spins up and of spins down .",
    "hence , for a convenience hereafter they are called the up clusters and the down clusters and are marked with the superscripts @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .    the cluster multiplicities are defined as their occupancy numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the cluster size .",
    "it is clear that size of the maximal cluster can not exceed @xmath2 and , hence , only the spin configurations obeying the condition @xmath10 can be realized in the considered system .",
    "the total numbers of up and down spin clusters are , respectively , denoted as @xmath11 and @xmath12 . hereafter , it is assumed that the blind index of cluster size runs over all positive integers . in",
    "what follows the set of all occupancy numbers @xmath13 is called as a microscopic configuration .",
    "each microscopic configuration @xmath14 of the system defines its total energy , which receives a contribution @xmath15 from every up cluster or from every down cluster of size @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , there exist the contacts of neighboring clusters with opposite spins and their number is @xmath16 .",
    "evidently , any such a contact gives a contribution @xmath4 to the system energy .",
    "therefore , using the definitions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 we can cast the total energy of the system for a given microscopic configuration @xmath14 as @xmath19 .",
    "% \\ ] ] obviously , the total number of spins @xmath20 should coincide with the lattice size @xmath2 . since up and down clusters alternate each other , then the only configurations with @xmath21 can be realized in the considered system .",
    "hence , taking into account the fact that the total number of cluster permutations is @xmath22 we write the degeneracy factor of the microscopic configuration @xmath14 as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the kronecker delta - symbol .",
    "note that every configurations with @xmath25 should have a degeneracy 2 , since it can be `` constructed '' only from the configurations @xmath26 and @xmath27 by combining one of their outer clusters with any other cluster of the spin sign which coincides with the one of outer cluster .",
    "the @xmath28 statistical moment of the down cluster occupancy number we define as @xmath29^q g_\\sigma \\ , e^{-\\frac{h_\\sigma}{t}+a\\beta(n_\\sigma - n ) } , % \\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the temperature and @xmath31 is the lattice constant .",
    "a summation over the configurations @xmath14 in ( [ iii ] ) should be understood as a summation over all nonnegative integers @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath34 is introduced into ( [ iii ] ) for the convenience of analytical calculations and its value is chosen to satisfy the conditions @xmath35 and @xmath36 . however",
    ", this parameter does not affect any observable due to the condition @xmath37 provided by the kronecker delta - symbols in eq .",
    "( [ ii ] ) .",
    "note , that @xmath38 yields the partition function @xmath39 , whereas a symmetry between up and down spins leads to the equality @xmath40 . using eqs .",
    "( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) , the definition of @xmath41 along with the integral representation of the kronecker delta - symbol @xmath42 and of the factorials @xmath43 we can write @xmath44 now the summations over @xmath7 and @xmath45 in ( [ iv ] ) can be performed trivially giving the corresponding exponential functions . in what follows we are mainly interested in finding the statistical moments of @xmath46 of the zeroth and first order . for @xmath47",
    "the summation over @xmath48 generates an exponential function multiplied by the factor @xmath49 .",
    "then , each product over @xmath9 in ( [ iv ] ) can be carried out , since it is equivalent to a summation of decreasing geometric progressions in the exponential .",
    "in addition , the chosen range of @xmath34 provides a convergence of the integrals over @xmath50 and @xmath51 variables due to negative real part of these exponential functions .",
    "hence , for @xmath38 and @xmath52 one can easily find @xmath53 where the real variables of integration @xmath54 and @xmath55 are now changed to the complex ones @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the integrand with respect to the variable @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) contains three poles .",
    "the first one @xmath59 exists for @xmath38 only .",
    "however , the contribution of this pole does not produce any singularity with respect to the @xmath60 variable and , hence , it can be safely neglected . the second pole existing at any value of @xmath61 corresponds to @xmath62 .",
    "it does not contribute to @xmath63 since it is located out of the contour @xmath64 due to the chosen value of the regularization parameter @xmath34 .",
    "thus , accounting only for the simple pole @xmath65 we obtain @xmath66 this expression clearly demonstrates that for @xmath67 and @xmath68 the integral function has a specific simple pole @xmath69 which , as we discuss below , is responsible for the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath70 .",
    "taking @xmath38 we immediately reproduce the well - known partition function of the one dimensional ising model with free edges @xcite , i.e. @xmath71 for @xmath72 the average occupancy number of the down clusters is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ vi ] ) for @xmath67 @xmath73 whereas @xmath74 .",
    "note , that @xmath75 for all @xmath76 .",
    "the direct calculation based on this expression demonstrates that @xmath77 which is an obvious consequence of the symmetry between the spins up and down , if the external magnetic field is absent .    an explicit expression ( [ viii ] ) for @xmath70 allows us to find the size distribution function of clusters @xmath78 which is proportional to their average occupancy number . since the size distribution functions are the same for both kinds of clusters , we do distinguish them .",
    "the normalized distribution @xmath78 is obtained from the condition that the total probability to find up ( or down ) cluster of any size is @xmath79 , i. e. @xmath80 .",
    "this condition follows from the symmetry between up and down spins .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath81 and @xmath82 . from eq .",
    "( [ ix ] ) one can see that @xmath78 has not only the exponential part @xmath83 , but also it includes the factor which is linear in @xmath76 .",
    "the power part of the size distribution functions is known in several statistical models of cluster type .",
    "traditionally it is taken into account by the fisher topological exponent @xmath84 as @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "however , the linear @xmath76-part of the size distribution function ( [ ix ] ) disappears in the thermodynamic limit @xmath86 , since in this limit one finds @xmath87 .",
    "hence , it is interesting to analyze the distribution @xmath78 of other lattice models in order to find possible restrictions on values of the fisher index @xmath84 .",
    "the growing interest to a bimodality is caused by the widespread belief that it can serve as a robust signal of the first order phase transition in finite systems . as it was mention above this concept",
    "is based on t. l. hill idea @xcite that , each peak of the bimodal distribution is associated with a pure phase .",
    "however , this idea can not be sufficiently justified , since in finite systems the analog of mixed phase is not just a mixture of two pure phases @xcite . according to exact analytical solutions found for several cluster models in finite systems @xcite the finite volume analog of mixed phase is represented by a combination of an analog of gaseous phase , which is stable , and some even number of different metastable states .",
    "the number of metastable states is determined by thermodynamic parameters , of course , but the whole point is that their identification with the help of a single peak ( or maximum ) of the size distribution function does not seem to be a well defined procedure @xcite .",
    "having at hand an explicit expression for cluster size distribution we are able to answer the question what is the reason for a bimodal behavior . from eq .",
    "( [ ix ] ) it follows that @xmath88 for finite @xmath2 and for @xmath89 ( a ferromagnetic system at zero temperature ) , whereas the limit @xmath90 ( an antiferromagnetic system at zero temperature ) generates @xmath91 for finite @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that at some intermediate value of the lattice constant @xmath0 the monomer dominant regime should switch to the regime of dominance of the cluster of maximal size . this switching is characterized by the comparable probabilities to find the monomers ( dimers , trimers , etc . ) and the cluster of maximal size and , hence , at some value of @xmath0 the distribution function @xmath78 becomes a non - monotonic one .",
    "a direct inspection of eq . ( [ ix ] ) shows that for @xmath92 and finite @xmath2 the derivative @xmath93 is always negative , i.e. @xmath94 and , hence , at this interval of cluster sizes the function @xmath78 is a monotonic one .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of the distribution @xmath78 is caused by presence of the kronecker delta - symbol @xmath95 .",
    "it is clear that the cluster size distribution is non - monotonic , if the inequality @xmath96 is obeyed or , equivalently , if @xmath97 this inequality can be fulfilled for @xmath98 , only .",
    "this means that the non - monotonicity of @xmath78 in the one dimensional ising model can appear in the ferromagnetic case only .",
    "it is necessary to stress that the value of @xmath1 does not depend on @xmath2 and @xmath4 and , hence , it is a universal constant .",
    "thus , in the ferromagnetic case the found cluster distribution function @xmath78 is non - monotonic ( bimodal ) for any size of the lattice and any value of the spin coupling .",
    "however , we should note that the bimodal behavior of the cluster size distribution is washed out in the thermodynamic limit @xmath86 , since in this case @xmath99 for all finite values of the lattice constant @xmath0 .",
    "the mathematical reason of the non - monotonic behavior of cluster size distribution in the present model is clear now .",
    "although in this model the bimodality phenomenon appears as the finite size effect , we would like to add a few words on its substantial origin . for this purpose let us consider an auxiliary infinite lattice with the cluster distribution function @xmath100 which for all @xmath76 obeying inequality @xmath101",
    "is defined as @xmath102 where the parameter @xmath103 provides the nonnegative value of @xmath104 .",
    "for @xmath105 the distribution ( [ x ] ) describes clusters of almost all sizes ( up to @xmath106 ) on an equal footing .",
    "note , that in eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) the quantity @xmath2 is treated as a finite parameter .",
    "suppose now that we randomly choose on this infinite lattice the infinite amount of intervals of the length @xmath2 each .",
    "it is clear that the size distribution of small clusters will be given by eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) , whereas the clusters with @xmath107 will increase the occupancy number of the cluster of maximal size ( they will also contribute to the smaller clusters , but this fact is already taken into account in ( [ ix ] ) ) .",
    "this can be easily seen , if one sums up all values of @xmath100 for @xmath107 @xmath108 although in the sum above the terms with @xmath109 are negative , their contribution is practically negligible due to the adopted assumption that @xmath105 .",
    "the result of summation is nothing else , but the term in @xmath110 of eq .",
    "( [ ix ] ) which is proportional to the kronecker delta - symbol .",

    "these simulations were made using the swendsen - wang algorithm .",
    "for each run the first @xmath117 lattice configurations were discarded to ensure a complete thermalization , and the next @xmath118 lattice measurements were made while discarding every 5 lattice configurations between the measurements . for each measurement the total expectation of the number of clusters of all sizes was calculated , then the jackknife error analysis was used to obtain the error estimate of the mean values obtained .",
    "our numerical study includes 14 values of the lattice constant in the range from 0 to 2.5 .",
    "we would like to stress that the coincidence of distribution functions simulated numerically and calculated according to formula ( @xmath119 ) is perfect . in fig .",
    "[ fig ] the cluster size distribution is shown for three values of the lattice constant @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath120 the cluster size distribution is monotonic for both values of @xmath2 . at the same time for the values of lattice constant above the `` critical '' one , i.e. for @xmath121 and for @xmath122 , one can clearly see the bimodal distribution in fig .",
    "it is also seen that bimodality is enhanced with the lattice constant increasing .",
    "we have to remind once again that the present model does not have any phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence , the one dimensional ising model gives an explicit counterexample to treating bimodality as a signal of phase transition in finite systems .",
    "in this work we found an analytical solution of the one dimensional ising model in terms of the geometrical clusters composed of the neighboring spins of the same direction .",
    "it is clear that the present formulation is an important step towards establishing a firm connection between the lattice spin systems and the statistical models of cluster type .",
    "the developed approach allows us to exactly calculate the size distribution of spin clusters for finite and infinite lattice sizes . using the exact formulae we showed that for finite size of the lattice the one dimensional ising model has a bimodal size distribution of clusters for @xmath123 .",
    "we demonstrate that the bimodal size distribution of spin clusters in the present model is a finite size effect which appears due to a `` condensation '' of clusters whose size exceeds the lattice extent to the largest cluster .",
    "such a `` condensation '' to the maximal cluster leads to the non - monotonic size distribution at sufficiently large values of the lattice constant in ferromagnetic case only .",
    "the obtained result is valid for all sizes of the lattice , however , in the thermodynamic limit it is washed out .",
    "it provides us with an explicit counterexample to the widely spread belief about an exclusive role of bimodality as a signal of phase transition in finite systems @xcite .",
    "our criticism is in full coherence with the results of refs .",
