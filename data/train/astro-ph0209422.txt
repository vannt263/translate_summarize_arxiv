    "from ten - years of data collected by the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) , we have shown that the energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays extends up to a few times 10@xmath1ev without the expected gzk cutoff @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the hires collaboration has recently claimed that the gzk cutoff may be present with their exposure being similar to agasa @xcite .",
    "ave et al .",
    "@xcite have re - analyzed the haverah park events and their energies are reduced by about 30% using a new energy conversion formula .",
    "although we have already published our statistical and systematic errors in the energy determination in related papers @xcite , it is now quite important to reevaluate uncertainties in the energy determination of agasa events with the accumulated data of ten years .",
    "the uncertainties due to shower front structure and delayed particles far from a shower core are also evaluated and described in some detail .",
    "the agasa array is the largest operating surface array , covering an area of about 100km@xmath4 and consisting of 111 surface detectors of 2.2m@xmath4 area @xcite .",
    "each surface detector is situated with a nearest - neighbor separation of about 1 km and the detectors are sequentially connected with pairs of optical fibers .",
    "all detectors are controlled at detector sites with their own cpu and through rapid communication with a central computer . in the early stage of our experiment agasa",
    "was divided into four sub - arrays called `` branches '' for topographical reasons , and air showers were observed independently in each branch .",
    "the data acquisition system of agasa was improved and the four branches were unified into a single detection system in december 1995 @xcite .",
    "after this improvement the array has operated in a quite stable manner with a duty cycle of about 95% , while the duty cycle before unification was 89% .    in a widely spread surface array like agasa , the local density of charged particles at a specific distance from the shower axis is well established as an energy estimator @xcite since the local density of the electromagnetic component depends weakly on variations in interaction models , fluctuations in shower development and primary mass . in the agasa experiment",
    ", we adopt the local density at 600 m , @xmath5 , which is determined by fitting a lateral distribution function ( ldf ) of observed particle densities to an empirical formula @xcite .",
    "this empirical formula is found to be valid for eas with energies up to 10@xmath1ev and for zenith angles smaller than 45@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the relation for converting @xmath5 to primary energy has been evaluated so far by monte carlo simulations @xcite up to 10@xmath2ev and is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath5 value per m@xmath4 for a vertically incident shower .",
    "this conversion relation is derived from electron components for air showers observed 900 m above sea level . in  [ ssect : energy ] , a new conversion constant is evaluated taking account of the average altitude .",
    "more modern simulation codes have been used in this simulation . in the southeast corner of agasa",
    "there is the akeno 1km@xmath9 array @xcite .",
    "this is a densely packed array of detectors covering an area of 1km@xmath9 operated since 1979 .",
    "this array was used to determine the energy spectrum between 10@xmath3ev and 10@xmath10ev . in this experiment ,",
    "the total number of electrons , known as the shower size @xmath11 , was used as an energy estimator . the relation between this energy spectrum and the agasa energy spectrum",
    "is discussed in ",
    "[ sect : spectrum ] .",
    "the agasa array consists of plastic scintillators of 2.2m@xmath4 area , and the light from these scintillators is viewed by a 125 mm diameter hamamatsu r1512 photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) at the bottom of each enclosure box .",
    "the scintillators are 5 cm thick ( 0.14 radiation lengths ) .",
    "the enclosure box and a detector hut are made of steel with 2 mm and 0.4 mm thickness , respectively .",
    "there is another type of enclosure box used for 17 detectors in the akeno branch , in which pmt is mounted at the top of each enclosure box .    in order to cover a dynamic range from 0.3 to a few times 10@xmath12 particles per detector ,",
    "a logarithmic amplifier is used @xcite .",
    "the number of incident particles is determined from the pulse width , which is obtained by presenting such a signal that decays exponentially with a time constant of @xmath13s to a discriminator with a constant threshold level @xmath14 .",
    "the relation between the number of incident particles @xmath15 and the pulse width @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the pulse height ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a constant depending on the gain of the amplifier ) . by defining the pulse width for @xmath21 as @xmath22 , one obtains @xmath23 figure [ fig : tb22_pwd ] shows a typical pulse width distribution ( pwd ) for omni - directional muons , and its peak value is used as @xmath22 in the experimental convenience .    in the akeno experiment",
    ", the original definition of a `` single particle '' was based on the average value ( @xmath24 ) of a pulse height distribution ( phd ) from muons traversing a scintillator vertically @xcite .",
    "this @xmath24 is accidentally coincident with the peak value @xmath25 of the phd of omni - directional muons , since the phd is not a gaussian distribution but is subject to landau fluctuations and coincidental incidence of two or more particles .",
    "if we express the pulse height corresponding to the peak value of pwd as @xmath26 , the parameter @xmath25 is related to @xmath26 by @xmath27 this equation can be derived under an assumption that main part of phd is expressed by a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of @xmath28 . by converting the pulse height of this gaussian distribution to the pulse width by using equation ( 2 ) , and by evaluating @xmath29 at the maximum of the distribution , equation ( 4 ) is obtained . with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 . the density measured in units of @xmath26 ,",
    "therefore , is 1.1 times smaller than that measured in units of @xmath33 . on the other hand ,",
    "the density measured with a scintillator in units of @xmath24 is 1.1 times larger than the particle density measured with spark chambers between 10 m and 100 m from shower cores @xcite .",
    "the efficiencies and other details of the spark chamber are described in @xcite .",
    "this factor 1.1 was interpreted as due to the transition effect of electromagnetic components in scintillator compared to the electron density measured in spark chamber @xcite .",
    "this means that the density in units of @xmath26 corresponds to an electron density measured by a spark chamber , given that the ratio of densities measured with scintillators and spark chambers is 1.1 .",
    "the number of particles in units of @xmath26 , therefore , coincides with the electron density and has been applied so far to estimate primary energy using equation ( [ eq : econv ] ) .    to examine whether a `` single particle '' is appropriate ,",
    "the corsika program has been used to simulate densities measured by a scintillator of a 5 cm thickness @xcite . in this simulation",
    ", a `` single particle '' corresponds to @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig : detsim_lateral ] plots the lateral distribution of energy deposit in the scintillator in units of @xmath24 ( closed circles ) , and it is compared with the experimental ldf ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the simulated ldf is flatter than the experimental one .",
    "the simulated density reflects the number of electrons near the core ( up to about 200 m from the core ) , but becomes larger than the electron density with increasing core distance .",
    "recently we have also studied the detector response with the geant simulation @xcite . in this simulation",
    ", a `` single particle '' is defined as the peak value of @xmath34(energy deposit in scintillator ) for omni - directional muons with their energy spectrum to represent the experimental @xmath26 . here",
    "we take account of the real configuration of a detector , conversion of photons in the wall of the enclosure box and the detector hut , scattering of particles , decay of unstable particles ( pions , kaons and etc ) , and the 4-momentum of shower particles .",
    "the shape of the lateral distribution is nearly consistent with the experimental ldf , though it is also a little flatter than the experimental one .",
    "the details will be described in @xcite .",
    "the detector positions were measured using a stereo camera from an airplane with accuracies of @xmath35 0.1 m and @xmath36 0.3 m .",
    "the cable lengths ( the propagation delay times of signals ) from the akeno observatory to each detector is regularly measured with accuracy of 0.1ns in each run ( about twice a day ) .",
    "figure [ fig : tb22_cable ] shows the variation in cable length for a typical detector as a function of day .",
    "a discontinuity around 50,000 mjd is due to the movement of the detector position and another one is due to the system upgrade in 1995 .",
    "in equation ( [ eq : log_number ] ) , there are two parameters which should be determined .",
    "the first one is the `` single particle '' @xmath22 ( @xmath37 ) . in the agasa experiment ,",
    "pulse widths of all incident particles are recorded and their pwd is stored in the memory as shown in figure [ fig : tb22_pwd ] , and then @xmath22 is determined in every run .",
    "figure [ fig : tb22_peak](a ) shows the time variation of @xmath22 for a typical detector over 11-years of operation . there is a clear seasonal variation with a @xmath03% fluctuation , but",
    "this variation has been calibrated in the air shower analysis using monthly data .",
    "the variance @xmath38 within each month of data is determined and @xmath39 is shown for all detectors in figure [ fig : tb22_peak](b ) , with @xmath40 for a 68% c.l .",
    "the second important parameter is the decay constant @xmath41 .",
    "although we have directly measured the @xmath41 values with a led several times during agasa s operation , they are not enough to estimate the time variation of @xmath42 .",
    "we estimate this variation using the observed pwds . assuming the density ( particle number ) spectrum of incident particles in a detector is @xmath43 , one obtains @xmath44 the ratio @xmath45 is the slope of the pwd , so that the ratio @xmath42 is expressed by @xmath46 figure [ fig : tb22_slope](a ) shows the time variation in @xmath47 for a typical detector . the variance @xmath48 is determined throughout the observation time ( 11 years ) for each detector . for all 111 detectors , @xmath49",
    "is plotted in figure [ fig : tb22_slope](b ) , and @xmath50 at a 68% c.l .",
    "this fluctuation causes an uncertainty in density estimation of 4% , 7% , 11% and 15% for 10 , 10@xmath4 , 10@xmath51 and 10@xmath12 particles per detector , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath49 includes not only the change of @xmath41 but also that of @xmath52 caused by varying atmospheric conditions ( temperature and pressure ) . the real variation in @xmath53 is , therefore , smaller than that for @xmath47 discussed above .      1",
    ".   lateral distribution function : + in general , the number of detectors with measurable particle density is not enough to treat both the core location and the slope parameter in lateral distribution as free parameters for most of the observed showers . in order to avoid systematic errors in determination of lateral distribution ,",
    "we have used only showers well within the boundary of the array and introduced a new parameter which represents the degree of goodness in locating the core position which is estimated by the maximum likelihood method .",
    "the details is described in @xcite . + the empirical ldf",
    "thus determined @xcite is expressed by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the distance from the shower axis in meters .",
    "the moliere unit @xmath56 is 91.6 m at the akeno level .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is a function of zenith angle @xmath58 expressed by @xmath59 the uncertainty in the energy determination of showers due to the limited accuracy in determination of @xmath57 was discussed and estimated to be @xmath010% by yoshida et al .",
    "@xcite . + with observed showers , we have confirmed in @xcite that the empirical formula of equations ( [ eq : ldf ] ) can be applied to showers with energies up to 10@xmath60ev and with core distances up to 3 km by improving the errors of equation ( [ eq : eta ] ) by @xmath61 we may extend the present lateral distribution up to the highest energy observed , since any energy dependence of @xmath57 has not been observed . in the same manner as yoshida et al .",
    "@xcite , the systematic effect on @xmath5 estimation due to uncertainties in equation ( [ eq : etarev ] ) is evaluated to be @xmath07% for air showers with zenith angles smaller than 45@xmath6 .",
    "atmospheric attenuation : + since an inclined air shower traverses the atmosphere deeper than a vertical shower , a shower density @xmath62 observed at zenith angle @xmath58 must be transformed into @xmath8 corresponding to a vertical shower .",
    "the attenuation of @xmath62 is formulated as follows : @xmath63          \\hspace{2em } ,      \\label{eq : attenuation}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 920g / cm@xmath4 , @xmath66g / cm@xmath4 and @xmath67g / cm@xmath4 for @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath69 determination due to the uncertainty in the attenuation curve of @xmath5 was also discussed there .",
    "+ the attenuation curve of @xmath5 is now under reevaluation with the accumulated data up to zenith angles @xmath70 and using a modern simulation code .",
    "equation ( [ eq : attenuation ] ) is valid for observed events with @xmath68 , and aires simulation agrees well with the experimental formula and data @xcite .",
    "another important point of this study is that @xmath71s are independent of energy . the uncertainty in @xmath8 due to this transformation",
    "is estimated to be @xmath05% ; this value is also reduced from yoshida et al .",
    "@xcite because of the increased amount of observed showers .",
    "+ in the analysis we have assumed the symmetric distribution of particles around the shower axis by neglecting the difference of attenuation to each detector .",
    "the experimental ldf is determined by the average of these densities , and the fluctuation around the average is determined with these densities . in analysis procedure described in  [ ssect : analysis ] , this fluctuation is included in @xmath28 , which is used as a weight of each detector .",
    "accidental coincidence : + because we use the log - amplifier described above , the density could be overestimated if an accidental signal hits on the tail of the exponential pulse above the threshold level of the discriminator .",
    "the counting rate of the scintillation detector ( area 2.2m@xmath9 ) is about 500hz for signals exceeding the threshold of 0.3 particles per detector .",
    "the accidental coincidence of a background particle hitting a detector within the pulse of a single particle ( 10@xmath72s width ) occurs with a chance probability of @xmath73 . in the same way",
    ", one obtains 1.65 @xmath74 10@xmath75 for the probability during a 10 particle pulse ( 33@xmath72s width ) and 5.6 @xmath74 10@xmath75 for a 100 particle pulse ( 56@xmath72s width ) .",
    "this means that one of 200 , 61 , or 18 detectors in each case may record larger values than the real density .",
    "frequency of accidental pulses is much less than that of delayed particles described in ",
    "[ ssect : phenomenology](e ) and their pulse heights are smaller than 1 particle . with the present analysis method described in  [ ssect : analysis ] , a detector which deviates more than 3@xmath28 from the average ldf is excluded and hence this effect is negligible .",
    "shower front structure : + given our use of the log - amplifier , the density is properly estimated so long as the thickness of a shower front is less than a few 100ns .",
    "however , if the thickness is larger than this time width , we should take this effect into account to estimate the incident particle density appropriately .",
    "figure [ fig : yamanashi30m2 ] is an example of the arrival time distribution observed with a 30m@xmath4 scintillator @xcite , operated by the yamanashi university group and triggered by agasa .",
    "the core distance is 1,920 m and the primary energy is 2 @xmath74 10@xmath1ev .",
    "not only is the particle arrival time distribution broad , but 5 particles are delayed more than 3@xmath72s in this 30m@xmath4 detector . + the arrival time distribution of shower particles has been measured with a scintillation detector of 12m@xmath4 area together with the 30m@xmath4 detector .",
    "signal sequences of arriving particles are recorded in time bins of 50ns for the 30m@xmath4 detector and 20ns for the 12m@xmath4 detector in coincidence with the agasa trigger .",
    "the details of these experiments are described in honda et al .",
    "@xcite . from these experiments , the average shape of the arrival time distribution",
    "is expressed by @xmath76 where the scaling parameter @xmath77 is 168ns , 212ns , and 311ns at @xmath78 534 m , 750 m , and 1,050 m , respectively .",
    "these are shown by solid lines in figure [ fig : arrtime ] . beyond 1,050 m",
    "the events are too few to determine the average @xmath77 . however , if we extrapolate the relation assuming @xmath79 , we find @xmath80 440ns at @xmath78 1,500 m and 570ns at 2,000 m .",
    "if we extrapolate it assuming @xmath81 , @xmath80 490ns at @xmath78 1,500 m and 850ns at 2,000 m , respectively",
    ". the @xmath77 distribution of each event in these distant ranges seems to be nearer to , but shorter than the values extrapolated with @xmath81 .",
    "we use , therefore , the latter values in the present evaluation as upper bound up to 2,000 m and for events with energies up to 10@xmath1ev .",
    "these distributions are also drawn with dotted lines in figure [ fig : arrtime ] .",
    "the solid curves in figure [ fig : yamanashi30m2 ] correspond to the time distribution with @xmath80 800ns , which support the extrapolation with @xmath81 .",
    "+ using @xmath77 and the number of incident particles as parameters , we have derived the ratio ( the overestimation factor ) of the estimated density due to the broadening of the shower front structure to the density with @xmath82 as a function of core distance and primary energy .",
    "the results are drawn in figure [ fig : eff_thickness_ldf ] .",
    "the factor is nearly independent of primary energy up to a few 1,000 m .",
    "the factor increases rapidly with core distance above 1,500 m , but it decreases suddenly again at those core distances where the observed number of shower particles is near unity . from this figure , the overestimation factor for the density at 600",
    "m is @xmath833.5% and that around 1 km is @xmath836% for 10@xmath1ev showers . with our analysis method described in ",
    "[ ssect : analysis ] , the present @xmath5 may be overestimated by about 5% due to the broadening of the shower front structure with its fluctuation about @xmath05% .",
    "delayed particles : [ it : delay ] as shown in figure [ fig : yamanashi30m2 ] , there are particles at large core distances which are delayed by more than a few micro seconds with respect to normal shower particles .",
    "it was shown in the prototype agasa experiment that pulses delayed by more than 4@xmath72s are most likely to be low energy neutrons with energy 3040mev and the fraction of these pulses to the total shower particles is a few % between 1 km and 3 km @xcite . based on this result , we have so far assumed that the effect of delayed particles on the @xmath5 determination is within the errors due to other effects .",
    "+ in the following , we evaluate the effect of delayed particles on the @xmath5 determination with accumulated data from ten years of operation .",
    "if a delayed particle , whose energy loss in a scintillator corresponds to @xmath84 particles , hits a detector with time delay @xmath85 with respect to @xmath86 incident particles at @xmath87 , the pulse height @xmath88 is expressed by @xmath89 where @xmath86 and @xmath84 are in units of a `` single particle '' , and @xmath90 is the overestimation factor due to delayed particles .",
    "the @xmath90 value depends on @xmath91 and @xmath85 .",
    "it is , therefore , quite important to evaluate the density of delayed particles and their energy loss in a 5 cm scintillator experimentally .",
    "these values have been measured with the scintillation detectors of 30m@xmath4 and 12m@xmath4 area described in the previous section .",

    "next , the arrival direction ( zenith angle @xmath58 , azimuth angle @xmath115 ) is determined by minimizing the @xmath116 function : @xmath117      \\hspace{1.5em } , \\label{eq : chi2_dir}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is the observed time of the first particle incident on @xmath119-th detector ( the detector location is expressed by @xmath120 measured from the core position and @xmath121 is the distance from the shower axis , and @xmath122 denotes the observed density ) . here , @xmath123 is the propagation time of the tangential plane of the shower front , @xmath124 is the average time delay of the shower particles from this tangential plane , @xmath125 is the average deviation of shower particles , and @xmath126 denotes the time when the core hits the ground .",

    "those detectors that make @xmath116 large are excluded in the calculation as signals with accidental muons .",
    "this exclusion is continued until @xmath128 . usually , the number of excluded detectors is one or a few . in the next step ,",
    "we search for the core location and the shower size , which corresponds to the normalization factor in equation ( [ eq : ldf ] ) , to maximize the likelihood function : @xmath129      \\hspace{2em } ,   \\label{eq : ml_size}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is the electron density observed by @xmath119-th detector and @xmath130 is the particle density estimated from the ldf .",
    "the fluctuation of electron density @xmath131 takes account of fluctuations in the longitudinal development and the detector response .",
    "this fluctuation was experimentally expressed by teshima et al .",
    "@xcite . at this step ,",
    "we again exclude a detector if its observed density deviates by more than 3@xmath28 , and we assume these signals are possibly overestimated by an accidental coincidence or delayed particles .",

    "figure [ fig : resolution ] shows the distributions of energies evaluated using the above analysis method for a large number of artificial proton air shower events simulated with energies of 3 @xmath74 10@xmath2ev and 10@xmath1ev at zenith angles less than 45@xmath6 . for artificial events above 10@xmath2ev and 4",

    "although only events whose cores are located within the array area are used in our papers , some events with real cores located near but outside the array boundary are reconstructed as `` inside '' events .",
    "the assigned energies of such events are smaller than their real values since the core distance of detectors become nearer than the true distances . on the other hand , such events that are assigned `` outside '' the array boundary in the analysis procedure against their input core locations inside the array",

    "the effects from these mislocation of cores are taken into account in the distributions in figure [ fig : resolution ] and the exposure in figure [ fig : spec01073_fc ] .",
    "in order to derive the energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays , the observation time and the aperture for the selected events must be evaluated as a function of the primary energy .",
    "the aperture is determined by analyzing the artificial showers simulated over an area larger than the agasa area described above .",
    "figure [ fig : spec01073_fc ] shows the energy spectrum observed with agasa with zenith angles smaller than 45@xmath6 up until july 2002 .",

    "closed circles indicate these `` inside '' events , and open circles are `` well contained '' events whose cores are located at least 1 km inside the array boundary .",
    "the energy spectra for inside and well contained events agree well with each other and hence our criterion of selecting all events inside the boundary can be justified .",
    "though we have examined the systematic errors in energy determination carefully , it is not easy to calibrate the absolute energy experimentally to decide whether 10@xmath1ev candidate events really exceed the gzk cutoff energy .",
    "one method is to compare the spectrum with the extension of akeno energy spectrum measured at lower energies . at akeno",
    "there are arrays of various detector - spacing depending on the primary energy of interest , and energy spectra have been determined systematically over five decades in energy under the similar experimental procedures @xcite .    in the 10@xmath98ev energy region ,",

    "the ratio e@xmath137/e@xmath138 is 1.10 and the dispersion is 45% . since the median energy of the showers is 10@xmath139ev , the error in the @xmath5 determination by the 20km@xmath4 array is rather large and hence the wide spread is reasonable .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spectrumall ] , the spectrum obtained by the 1km@xmath9 array ( e@xmath136 ) is shown with open squares and that by agasa by closed squares .",

    "we have reevaluated the uncertainties in energy estimation using data accumulated over ten years .",
    "table [ tbl : systematics ] summarizes the major systematics and uncertainties in energy estimation . here , the symbol `` @xmath83 '' means that currently assigned energies should be pushed up under a particular effect , and the symbol `` @xmath140 '' represents a shift in the opposite direction .",
    "the probable overestimation of 10% due to shower front structure and delayed particles may be compensated for by the probable underestimation of the energy conversion factor by 10% , an effect resulting from the inclusion of the average altitude of agasa and the proper definition of what is meant by a `` single particle '' .",
    "adding uncertainties in quadrature , the systematic uncertainty in energy determination in the agasa experiment is estimated to be @xmath018% in total .",
    "therefore , the currently assigned energies of the agasa events have an accuracy of @xmath025% in event - reconstruction resolution and @xmath018% in systematics .",
    "it should be noted that the akeno - agasa spectra cover over five decades in energy , connecting smoothly from the _ knee _ to a few times 10@xmath1ev , except for a 10% difference in energy in the 10@xmath2ev region .",
    "this may be due to the difference in the energy conversion relations for the experiments and is within the systematic errors evaluated here .",
    "it is concluded that there are surely events above 10@xmath1ev and the energy spectrum extends up to a few times 10@xmath1ev .",
