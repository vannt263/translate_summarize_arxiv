    "most , and likely all , stars are formed in a clustered environment out of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "those surviving cloud dispersal and remaining gravitationally bound are seen as star clusters , with tens to thousands of member stars .",
    "a star cluster is dynamically relaxed in a time scale , in a system of equal stellar mass , @xmath1 @xcite , for which more massive stars tend to `` sink '' to the central part of a cluster , whereas members of lower masses are more dispersed in the velocity distribution so occupy a larger volume . here",
    "@xmath2 is the crossing time for a system with a characteristic size @xmath3 and typical velocity @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the total number of stars .",
    "one of the consequences of this `` mass segregation '' process is the lowest - mass members become most vulnerable to be ejected out of the system ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "such a stellar evaporation , with an @xmath6-folding time scale @xmath7 @xcite , leads to a continuing decrease of the total mass , and hence the gravitational binding energy , of the cluster .",
    "any external disturbance , such as the tidal force from nearby giant molecular clouds or star clusters , passages through galactic spiral arms or disks , or shear force by galactic differential rotation , only exacerbates to disintegrate the cluster .",
    "a recently dissolved system in the solar neighborhood could be recognized as a `` moving group '' as the then - members still share systemic kinematics and distances @xcite .",
    "eventually the escaped stars of a star cluster supply the disk field population .",
    "berkeley17 ( be17 , ra=05:20:37 , decl.=+30:35:12 , j2000 ) , with an age @xmath0  gyr , is considered one of the oldest galactic open clusters @xcite , rivaling globular clusters . at a helio - distance of 2700  pc @xcite located near the galactic anti - center ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , it is interesting to investigate how an aged disk cluster like berkeley17 survives the disruption processes",
    ". @xcite used a probabilistic star counting of 2mass sources and inferred an elongated shape of this cluster , with a noticeable tail pointing in the direction to the galactic disk .",
    "the angular extent of the tail is comparable to the core of the cluster itself , @xmath10@xmath11 , or about 5  pc in projected length given the distance to berkeley17 .",
    "interestingly , the structural analysis @xcite also suggested an antitail , typical of tidal distortion , in contrast to stellar debris trailed in the cluster s orbital motion . here",
    "we present the analysis of the stellar population , using pan - starrs data , in the tails , in comparison to that in the core , to diagnose stripping of lower - mass stars from the cluster .",
    "this cluster is also known to have a rich population of blue stragglers @xcite , which are stars staying on the main sequence longer than expected by standard theories of stellar evolution .",
    "the blue stragglers have been studied in other open clusters for spectroscopic analysis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ngc 2632 ) , contact binaries ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ngc6791 ) and also variability ( * ? ? ?",
    "* berkeley39 ) .",
    "berkeley17 also appears to have a prominent horizontal branch extending to the blue .",
    "we diagnose how the previously identified blue stragglers could have been confused by field stars , and by the blue horizontal - branch population of the cluster .",
    "berkeley17 has a mean proper motion @xmath12  mas  yr@xmath13 , @xmath14  mas  yr@xmath13 @xcite . given the distance to the cluster",
    ", the proper motion can not be used readily to discriminate members against field stars .",
    "here we utilize stellar photometry to analyze the stellar population in the core , tails and the blue straggler candidates in the cluster .",
    "stellar photometric data are taken from the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the prototype of pan - starrs ( ps1 ) , used for the project reported here , provides photometric data with limiting magnitudes @xmath15  mag , @xmath16  mag , @xmath17  mag , @xmath18  mag , and @xmath19  mag , and a saturation limit around @xmath20  mag @xcite .",
    "only objects with a clear detection in every ps1 band are included in the analysis . while ps1 had observations at multiple epochs , for the work reported here only the average magnitude in each band is used .",
    "for ps1 sources within a field of @xmath21 around berkeley17 , the clustering parameter was computed for each star , as prescribed in @xcite , as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the total number of neighbouring stars for star @xmath24 within a specified `` neighborhood radius '' , and @xmath25 is the average number of field stars within the same radius estimated by a star field away from the cluster yet representative of the field star population .",
    "effectively , @xmath26 is a measure of the spatial probability of a cluster member , being close to unity in a crowded region , and nearly null in a background field .",
    "the surface number density of stars is then calculated by summation of the clustering parameter of every star in a sky grid . for berkeley17",
    ", the neighborhood radius was chosen to be @xmath27 , yielding an average @xmath28 .",
    "it is assuring that the tail - like structure detected with 2mass @xcite was recovered in the analysis using ps1 data ( figure  [ fig : contour ] ) .",
    "the approximate centers of the tails are located at @xmath29 ( hereafter tail a ) , and @xmath30 ( hereafter tail b ) , respectively .",
    "we analyzed separately the `` core '' , and tails a and b. for the core we chose a radius of @xmath31 , and both tails with a radius of @xmath32 each .",
    "our goal was to compare the stellar properties in the cluster core and in the tails .      to remove field star contamination",
    ", we exercised a statistical `` cleaning '' of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "for this analysis , only stars with photometric uncertainties less than 0.1  mag in both @xmath33 and @xmath34 were used . a reference field",
    "( figure  [ fig : field]a ) was chosen having the same galactic latitude as berkeley17 and the same spatial area as the cluster core .",
    "for every star found in the field cmd ( figure  [ fig : field]b ) , all the stars in the target cmd within a box of size @xmath35 mag in @xmath36 and @xmath37 mag in @xmath33 centered on the field star were listed .",
    "if a target star has multiple field counterparts , the one with the least number of target counterparts is considered the `` match '' .",
    "this ensured that each target star with a match is eliminated , resulting in a cleaned cmd .",
    "the selection of the box size was somewhat subjective .",
    "it was chosen to account for the photometric uncertainties , and as the most suitable after trying both smaller ones , which proved ineffective in cleaning a sufficient number of field stars , and larger ones , which over - cleaned possible cluster members .",
    "the effectiveness of this field decontamination procedure , and the random nature of the reference field , were affirmed by using another field region , also having the same galactic latitude and sky area as the cluster , to clean our reference field .",
    "the result , depicted in figure  [ fig : fieldclean ] , was considered satisfactory as it is uncorrelated to the isochrone for berkeley 17 .",
    "therefore , the reference field was subsequently used for cleaning the core cmd .",
    "the cmds for the tails were cleaned by the same manner , except with a subregion of the reference field having the same sky area as the tails .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmds ] exhibits the observed cmds for the core and the two tails while the corresponding cleaned cmds are shown in figure  [ fig : massdist ] .",
    "stellar masses were inferred from the cmds , with a 10 gyr parsec stellar evolution isochrone @xcite , adopting a distance of 2.7  kpc ( which was more suitable than the distance of 1.8  kpc found by * ? ? ? * ) and metallicity of 0.007 ( @xmath38 = -0.33 $ ] ) . a reddening @xmath39 was found to have a marginally better isochrone fit to the main sequence than the alternative value of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the extinction values in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 bands were taken from the reddening coefficients presented by @xcite , assuming a nominal total - to - selective extinction @xmath41 .",
    "we note that a cleaned cmd is a statistical representation of the cluster , so can be used to estimate the mass function , but membership of individual stars is not available .",
    "we only included stars with magnitudes below the turn off ( no giants because the mass is uncertain ) and within 0.2  mag in color of the isochrone ( cmds in figure  [ fig : massdist ] ) .",
    "this leads to a stellar mass range 0.675  m@xmath42 to 0.925  m@xmath42 .",
    "the mass functions for the core and the two tails are also presented in figure  [ fig : massdist ] .",
    "even though our sample covers a relatively small mass range ( 0.25  m@xmath42 ) , the mass distribution in the core shows a rising trend towards higher mass .",
    "the result should not be due to observational bias and is hence statistically significant , given a sufficient number of stars in each mass bin , up to nearly 50 stars in the highest mass bin . in spite of the small number of stars detected in either tail , the sample consists exclusively of low - mass stars .",
    "any observational bias , if present , would have been in favor of high - mass stars .",
    "the stellar population in the tails is clearly different from that in the cluster core .",
    "some old open clusters , like globular clusters , are known to be rich in blue stragglers , the population of stars above the main sequence turnoff .",
    "berkeley17 is among them , with 31 blue straggler candidates identified @xcite using the photometric data obtained by @xcite .",
    "we investigated their list of blue straggler candidates with the same ps1 data for the morphological study presented above .",
    "the equatorial coordinates of the candidates in @xcite were obtained from @xcite using webda , and the ps1 counterparts were identified within @xmath43 .",
    "of the 31 candidates , 28 are found within the core region and 3 are outside our analysis region , as seen in figure  [ fig : spatclus ] .",
    "their positions in the cmds are indicated in figure  [ fig : cmds ] .",
    "the aforementioned statistical cleaning resulted in the removal of 13 candidates in the core cmd , indicating about half of these candidates should likely be field contamination .",
    "reliable proper motion and radial velocity measurements are needed to ascertain the membership .",
    "assuming the same contamination fraction , then , the blue stragglers in berkeley17 are predominantly concentrated in the core , supporting the notion of their massive nature .",
    "the metallicity of berkeley17 , @xmath44}\\approx-0.33 $ ] , is typical given its galactocentric distance @xmath45  kpc @xcite at the outer disk , where external perturbation is expected to be low .",
    "still , the longevity of such an old open cluster remains an open issue .",
    "the size of the core , @xmath46  pc , is within the ballpark figure for old clusters @xcite .",
    "while old open clusters have a large scale height from the galactic plane , berkeley17 , with @xmath47  pc , is located close to the disk .",
    "the cause of the core - tail morphology of berkeley17 is unclear . with an antitail",
    ", it should be of tidal origin , rather than a stellar trail left out in orbit . combining the numbers of members in the core and in the tails , more massive stars outnumber the less massive ones .",
    "this indicates a dynamically evolved state .",
    "such a flat or inverted luminosity / mass function is not uncommon in old clusters ( for relevant references see * ? ? ?",
    "this means the low - mass then - members of berkeley17 have been stripped .",
    "our analysis did not include the post - main sequence population , but given @xmath48 members in the 0.6750.925  m@xmath42 range , the original cluster should have been as massive as a super star cluster , perhaps as the precursor of a globular cluster @xcite .",
    "one possible tidal source is the perseus arm , known to be located at 1.95  kpc @xcite . a sample of newly found star clusters toward the galactic anticenter ( lin et al . in preparation )",
    "using pan - starrs data led to an estimated full - width - half - maximum of @xmath49  kpc for the perseus arm .",
    "being near the plane , berkeley17 is immediately behind and at the outer reach of the arm , hence is vulnerable to the tidal pull .",
    "one clue for the scenario is the unusual radial velocity for berkeley17 , @xmath50  km  s@xmath13 , suggestive of a large space @xmath51 velocity @xcite , which happens to be pulled toward the arm in this line of sight .",
    "the cleaned cmds unequivocally show members above the main sequence turnoff .",
    "all , however , may not be blue stragglers .",
    "berkeley17 has been recognized to exhibit a prominent blue horizontal branch , often seen in globular clusters , e.g. , in ngc3201 @xcite .",
    "blue horizontal - branch stars have nearly constant brightness , so have served as standard candles to constrain galactic kinematics @xcite .",
    "as presented above , about half of the blue straggler candidates identified in the cmd @xcite could be false positives . yet some may be blue horizontal - branch stars .",
    "spectroscopic classification is needed to clarify the nature of these blue stragglers versus blue horizontal - branch stars or field stars .",
