    "large complex systems are composed of various interconnected components .",
    "the measure of the behavior of a single component thus results from the superimposition of different factors acting at different levels .",
    "common factors such as global trends or external socio - economical conditions obviously play a role but usually different sub - units ( such as users in the internet , states or regions in a country ) will react in different ways and add their local dynamics to the collective pattern . for example",
    ", the number of downloads on a website depends on factors such as the time of the day but one can also observe fluctuations from a user to another one  @xcite . in the case of criminality , favorable socio - economical conditions will impose a global decreasing trend while local policies will affect the regional time series . in the case of financial series",
    ", the market imposes its own trend and some stocks respond to it more or less dramatically . in all these cases it is important to be able to distinguish",
    "if the stocks or regions are at the source of their fluctuations or if on the opposite , they just follow the collective trend .    extracting local effects in a collection of time",
    "series is thus a crucial problem in assessing the efficiency of local policies and more generally , for the understanding of the causes of fluctuations .",
    "this problem is very general and as the availability of data is always increasing particularly in social sciences , it becomes always more important for the modeling @xcite and the understanding of these systems .",
    "there is obviously a huge literature on studying stochastic signals  @xcite ranging from standard methods to more recents ones such as the detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite , independent component analysis  @xcite , and separation of external and internal variables  @xcite .",
    "most of these methods treat the internal dynamics as a small local perturbation with zero mean which is in contrast with the method proposed here .    in a first part we present the method . in a second part",
    ", we test it on synthetic series generated by correlated random walkers .",
    "we then apply the method to empirical data of crime rates in the us and france , and obesity rates in the us , for which , to our knowledge , no general quantitative method is known to provide such separation between global and local trends .",
    "in general , one has a set of time series @xmath2 where @xmath3 and we will assume that the number @xmath4 of units is large .",
    "the index @xmath5 refers to a particular unit on a specific scale such as a region , city , a country .",
    "the problem we address consists in extracting the collective trend and the effect of local contributions .",
    "one way to do so is to assume the signal @xmath6 to be of the form @xmath7 where the ` external ' part , @xmath8 , represents the impact on the region @xmath5 of a global trend , while the ` internal ' part , @xmath9 , represents the contribution due to purely local factors .",
    "usually , in order to discuss the impact of local policies , one compares a regional ( local ) curve @xmath10 to the average ( the national average in case of regions of a country ) computed as @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 if one has intensive variables and populations @xmath13 ) .",
    "although reasonable at first sight , this assumes that the local component is purely additive : @xmath14 _ local term_. in this article , following @xcite , we will rather consider the possibility of having both multiplicative and additive contributions .",
    "more specifically , we assume @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a collective trend common to all series , and which affects each region @xmath5 with a corresponding prefactor @xmath17 .",
    "these coefficients are assumed to depend weakly on the period considered , ie .",
    "to vary slowly with time .",
    "we thus write @xmath18 we first note that the global trend @xmath19 is known up to a multiplicative factor only ( one can not distinguish @xmath20 from @xmath21 whatever @xmath22 ) and we will come back to this issue of scale later . also , the purely additive case is recovered if the @xmath17 s are independent of @xmath5 .",
    "if on the contrary the @xmath17 s are different from one region to the other , the national average ( [ eq : fnat ] ) , @xmath23 , is then given by @xmath24 here and in the following we denote the sample average , that is the average over all units @xmath5 , by a bar , @xmath25 , and the temporal average by brackets @xmath26 .",
    "the ` naive ' local contribution is then estimated by the difference with the national average @xmath27 the estimated local contribution @xmath28 can thus be very different from the original one , @xmath29 , and the difference @xmath30 will be very large at all times @xmath31 where @xmath16 is large ( note that the conclusion would be the same by taking the national average as @xmath32 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that comparing local time series with the naive average could in general be very misleading . beside the correct computation of the external and internal contributions",
    ", the existence of both multiplicative and additive local contributions implies that the effect of local policies must be analyzed by considering both how the local unit @xmath5 follows the global trend ( @xmath17 ) and how evolves the purely internal contribution ( @xmath33 ) .    in a previous study  @xcite , menezes and barabasi proposed a simple method to separate the two contributions , internal ( @xmath9 ) and external ( @xmath34 written as @xmath35 ) .",
    "they assume that the temporal average @xmath36 is zero , and compute the external and internal parts by writing @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this method can be shown to be correct in very specific situations , such as the case where @xmath10 is the fluctuating number of random walkers at node @xmath5 in a network , but in many cases however , one can expect that the local contributions have a non zero sample average and the method of @xcite will yield incorrect results . indeed , if the hypothesis eq .",
    "( [ eq : hyp ] ) is exact , this method would give for @xmath19 the estimate @xmath39 , and in the limit @xmath40 for @xmath41 would lead to the estimates @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are different from the exact results , except if @xmath44 .    in order to separate the two contributions we propose in this article a totally different approach , by taking an independent component analysis point of view in which we do not assume that the local contribution has a zero average ( over time and/or over the regions ) .",
    "to express the idea that the ` internal ' contribution is by definition what is specifically independent of the global trend , and that the correlations between regions exist essentially only through their dependence in the global trend , we impose that the global trend is statistically independent from local fluctuations @xmath45 ( we denote by @xmath46 the connected correlation @xmath47 ) , and that these local fluctuations are essentially independent from region to region , that is for @xmath48 @xmath49 where this statement will be made more precise below .",
    "we show that , for large @xmath4 , these constraints ( [ eq:<wfint > ] ) , ( [ eq:<gigj > ] ) are sufficient to extract estimates of the global trend @xmath19 and of the @xmath17 s .",
    "we denote by @xmath50 the average of @xmath19 and by @xmath51 its dispersion , so that we write @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 with @xmath58 note that @xmath59 .",
    "if we now consider the correlations between these centered quantities , @xmath60 , we find @xmath61 if we assume that for @xmath48 @xmath62 is negligible ( of order @xmath63 ) compared to @xmath64 ( which is what we mean by having small correlations between internal components , eq .",
    "( [ eq:<gigj > ] ) ) , from this last expression we can show that at the dominant order in @xmath4 , we have @xmath65 these equations lead to @xmath66 which is valid when @xmath67 .",
    "we note that our method has a meaning only if strong correlations exist between the different @xmath10 s and if it is not the case , the definition of a global trend makes no sense and the approximation used in our calculations are not valid .    in the supporting information ( section si1 )",
    "we show that the factors @xmath68 s can also be computed as the components of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath69 - a method which is valid under the weaker assumption of having a small number ( compared to @xmath4 ) of non diagonal terms of the matrix @xmath70 which are not negligible .",
    "once the quantities @xmath68 are known , we can compute the global normalized pattern @xmath71 with the reasonable estimator given by @xmath72 , @xmath73 indeed , @xmath74 and since the quantity @xmath75 is a sum of independent variables with zero mean , we can expect it to behave as @xmath76 .",
    "we can show that this actually results from the initial assumptions .",
    "indeed , by construction @xmath77 and the second moment is @xmath78 by assumption we have @xmath79 if @xmath80 and we thus obtain @xmath81 . the computation of the @xmath68 s and of @xmath82 is equivalent to an independent component analysis ( ica ) @xcite with a _",
    "single _ source ( the global trend ) and a large number @xmath4 of sensors .",
    "however , in contrast with the standard ica , we are not interested in getting only the sources ( here the trend @xmath82 ) , but also the internal contributions ( which , in a standard ica framework , would be considered as noise terms , typically assumed to be small ) .",
    "we have already the @xmath68 s , and since @xmath71 has been calculated we can compute @xmath83 .",
    "we thus obtain at this stage @xmath84 this is a set of @xmath4 equations for @xmath85 unknown ( @xmath86 and the @xmath87 s ) and we are thus left with one free parameter , the ratio @xmath86 . knowing",
    "its value would give the @xmath4 local averages , the @xmath36 s .",
    "less importantly one may want also to fix the average @xmath50 ( hence both @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) in order to fully determine the pattern @xmath16 : this will be of interest only for making a direct comparison between this pattern and the national average ( [ eq : fnat ] ) .",
    "this equation  ( [ eq : mui ] ) suggests a statistical linear correlation between @xmath88 and @xmath89 , with a slope given by @xmath86 . we will indeed observe a linear correlation in the data sets ( next section , figure  @xmath90 )",
    "however , it could be that the @xmath36 s themselves are correlated with the @xmath68s . hence , and unfortunately",
    ", a linear regression can not be used to get an unbiased estimate of the parameter @xmath86 . in the absence of additional information or hypothesis",
    "this parameter remains arbitrary .",
    "however one may compare the qualitative results obtained for different choices of @xmath86 : which properties are robust , and which ones are fragile .",
    "in particular one would like to be able to access how a given region is behaving , compared to another given region , and/or to the global trend . to do so , in the applications below we",
    "will in particular analyze : ( i ) the correlations between the two local terms , @xmath68 and @xmath36 ; ( ii ) the robustness of the rank given by the @xmath36 s ; ( iii ) the sign of @xmath87 ; ( iv ) the quantitative and qualitative similarities between @xmath91 and the naive estimate @xmath28 .",
    "we will focus on two particular scenarios .",
    "first , one may ask the global trend to fall ` right in the middle ' of the @xmath4 series .",
    "there are different ways to quantify this .",
    "one way to do so is to note that , in the absence of internal contribution , @xmath92 would be equal to @xmath19 , hence @xmath93 would be equal to @xmath86 .",
    "therefore we may compute @xmath86 by imposing @xmath94 which is thus equivalent to impose @xmath95 an alternative is to ask the resulting @xmath9 to be as close as possible to the naive ones ( eq .  ( [ eq : naive ] ) ) , by minimizing @xmath96 which gives @xmath97 in both cases one may then fix @xmath50 from @xmath98 or by imposing @xmath99 for some arbitrary chosen @xmath100 .",
    "finally , one may rather ask for a conservative comparison with the naive approach by minimizing the difference between @xmath19 and @xmath101 : either by writing @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 ) and @xmath102 , or by minimizing @xmath103 , which gives @xmath104 for @xmath4 is large , one can check that the results depend weakly on any one of these reasonable choices .",
    "the second scenario considers the correlations between the @xmath87 s and the @xmath68 s .",
    "as we will see , the first hypothesis leads to a strictly negative correlation .",
    "an alternative is thus to explore the consequences of assuming no correlations , hence asking for @xmath105 which implies that the slope of the observed linear correlation @xmath106 with @xmath68 gives the value of @xmath86 .",
    "as explained above , for each application below we will discuss the robustness of the results with respect to these choices of the parameter @xmath86 .",
    "we can now summarize our method .",
    "it consists in ( i ) estimating the @xmath68 s using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ai ] ) ( or using the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix , section si1 ) , ( ii ) computing @xmath82 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) , and finally ( iii ) comparing the results for different hypothesis on @xmath86 as discussed above .",
    "we propose to call this method the _ external trend and internal component analysis _ ( * etica * ) .",
    "we note that if the hypothesis eq .",
    "( [ eq : hyp ] ) , ( [ eq:<wfint > ] ) , ( [ eq:<gigj > ] ) are correct , the method gives estimates of @xmath82 , the @xmath68s ( hence of @xmath107 ) which become exact in the limit @xmath31 and @xmath4 large , and a good estimate of the full trend @xmath19 ( hence of the @xmath87 ) whenever this trend , qualitatively , does fall ` in the middle ' of the time series .",
    "once we have extracted with this method the local contribution @xmath9 , and the collective pattern @xmath16 together with its redistribution factor @xmath17 for each local series , we can study different quantities , as illustrated below on different applications of the method .",
    "in general , although this method gives a pattern @xmath16 very similar to the sample average @xmath108 , we will see that there is non trivial structure in the prefactors @xmath17 s leading to non trivial local contributions @xmath91 .",
    "in some cases one may expect to have , in addition to the local contribution , a linear combination of several global trends ( a small number of sources ) : we leave for future work the extension of our method to several external trends .",
    "we first test our method on synthetic series and we then illustrate it on crime rate series ( in the united states and in france ) and on us obesity rate series . for the crime rates , a plot of the time series shows that obviously a common trend exists ( fig .",
    "c +    after computing the internal and external terms , we perform different tests in order to assess the validity of the approach .",
    "in particular , figure  @xmath90 shows a plot of the local factors @xmath68s versus the data time - averages , the @xmath106 s .",
    "c +    one observes a statistical linear correlation in the four set of time series .",
    "we stress that the @xmath68 s are computed from the covariance matrix of the data , hence after removing the means from the time series .",
    "the fact that we do observe a linear correlation is thus a hint that our hypothesis on the data structure is reasonable ( in contrast the very good linear correlation observed in @xcite can be shown to be an artefact of the method used in these works , leading to an exact proportionality independently of the data structure , ( see the section si2 ) .",
    "we now discuss in more detail the synthetic series , each one of the crime rate data sets , and the obesity rate .",
    "we can illustrate our method on the case of correlated random walkers described by the equation @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the global trend imposed to all walkers and the @xmath111 are gaussian noises but with possible correlations between different walkers @xmath112/12 $ ] where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are tunable parameters ( see the supporting section si3 ) . for @xmath115 , the random noises @xmath111 are independent and our method is very accurate : we choose for example a sinusoidal trend @xmath116 and we plot in the figure  @xmath117 the original signal , the exact local contribution and the local contribution computed with our method .",
    "c +    when the correlation between walkers is increasing we study the pearson correlation coefficient between the original local contribution and the estimate provided by our method , and we observe that our method is indeed accurate as long as the correlations between the @xmath118 s are not too large , which corresponds here to the condition @xmath119 .",
    "in criminology an essential question concerns the impact of local policies , a subject of much debate @xcite . in order to assess these local effects ( at the level of a state or a region ) , most authors consider the difference of a state evolution with the national average .",
    "as we noticed above this may lead to incorrect predictions . in this second part of applications ,",
    "we thus illustrate our method on the analysis of the series of crime rates in @xmath120 states in the us @xcite for the period @xmath121 , and about @xmath122 _ dpartements _ of france  @xcite for the period @xmath123 . on fig .",
    "@xmath124 we represent these time series normalized by their time average .",
    "the observed data collapse confirms the existence of a collective pattern ( we also show on this plot the collective pattern @xmath16 obtained with our method ) . for the french case , we have withdrawn outliers which do not satisfy our initial assumptions .",
    "the series of these _ dpartements _ are indeed uncorrelated with the rest of crime rates and can not be incorporated in the calculation of the collective pattern .",
    "we apply our method to these data and extract @xmath16 , the @xmath68 s and @xmath91 . as already mentioned , we plot on fig .",
    "@xmath90 the @xmath68 s vs. the averages @xmath106 , exhibiting a statistical linear correlation .",
    "we can check a posteriori that all conditions assumed in our calculation are fulfilled ( zero @xmath125 and small @xmath126 , see si1 ) .",
    "also , we checked that the coefficients @xmath17 do not vary too much the period considered , which is an important condition for our method ( see the discussion on different datasets in the si4 ) .    in order to assess quantitatively the importance of local versus external fluctuations",
    ", we study in particular the ratio of dispersions defined by @xmath127 where the external contribution is the standard deviation of @xmath128 , that is @xmath129 , and the internal one is given by @xmath130 .",
    "note that these quantities @xmath131 , being based on fluctuations , does not depend on @xmath132 .",
    "this quantity is found in both cases in france and in the us larger than one .",
    "this indicates that external factors always dominate over local fluctuations , while local policies seem to play a minor role . in the case of crime",
    ", these external effects might be socio - economical factors such as unemployment , density , etc .",
    "in addition to compute the average of the @xmath131 s , we can also observe the time evolution of the heterogeneity defined by the sample variances of the different components .",
    "we first observe on fig .  @xmath133",
    "that large fluctuations are observed in the transition period of mid-@xmath0 s during which crime rates increased significantly .",
    "c +    we also observe for the usa that until @xmath134 , fluctuations were essentially governed by local effects but that this trend is inverted and increases in the period post-@xmath1 s . in particular during the period @xmath135",
    "during which one observes a decline of crime rates  @xcite , it is the collective trend which determines the fluctuations .",
    "even we have presented results for reasonable choices of the parameter @xmath51 ( in the following we make the harmless choice @xmath136 ) , one can ask the question of the robustness of different observed properties .",
    "first , we can compare the predictions for @xmath51 obtained for the different assumptions used in this paper . in the upper panels for figs .",
    "@xmath137 and @xmath138 we show for the us ( france ) , the quantities @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "c +    we see on these figures that these quantities are zero for values of @xmath51 which are very close .",
    "we also compute the fraction of time @xmath142 for which @xmath91 and the naive calculation @xmath143 have different signs .",
    "c +    we plot in the lower panels of figs .",
    "@xmath133 and @xmath137 , the quantity @xmath144 showing a that for this range of @xmath51 , the signs of @xmath36 and @xmath143 are the same for about @xmath145 of the time period .",
    "we can also study the sign @xmath87 versus @xmath51 and we can observe some robustness . in particular , in the us case , approximately @xmath138 states ( ca , nv , mo , mi , ny , az ) have a positive local contribution ( in the range @xmath146 $ ] while @xmath138 states have always a negative local contribution ( vt , ga , la , nh , ct , ms ) . in these cases",
    "we can reasonably imagine that local policies have a noticeable effect .",
    "finally , we can also analyze the ranking of the local contributions @xmath36 versus @xmath51 by studying kendall s @xmath147 for the two consecutive series @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in both cases ( france and us )",
    "we observe a @xmath147 larger than @xmath150 for the range chose @xmath151 $ ] ( the control case for a random permutation being less than @xmath152 ) indicating a large robustness of the ranking .",
    "this means that independently of the assumption used to compute @xmath51 we can rank the different regions according to the importance of their local contribution .",
    "the prevalence of obesity ( defined as a body max index - bmi , which is the ratio of the body mass to the square of the height - larger than @xmath153 ) is rapidly increasing in the world @xcite and reached epidemic proportion in the us and is now a major public health concern @xcite .",
    "disparities by sex and between ethnic groups have been observed in the prevalence of obesity @xcite , but few studies focus on the effect of local factors and policies on the obesity rate .",
    "we thus apply our method to data from the cdc @xcite which describe the percentage of the population which is obese for each states in the us and for the period 1995 - 2008 . as in the crime rate case",
    ", we can compare the variances for the internal and external contributions ( see si5 ) and we observe that the external contribution is dominating since the year @xmath154 .",
    "this result means that the global trend is the major cause of the evolution of obesity in different states .",
    "we can get more detailed information about the specific behavior of the states by studying the ratio @xmath131 defined in eq .",
    "( 26 ) and the ratio of the fraction of the time average local contribution to the total signal @xmath155 .",
    "we represent these two quantities in a plane ( see figure @xmath156 ) and we first note that for all states @xmath157 which means that fluctuations are mainly governed by the global trend .",
    "c +    we can also divide the states into two groups ( with @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) .",
    "for large and positive @xmath160 , the states have a small @xmath17 which means that these states are the less susceptible to the global trend , while in the opposite case , the states are governed by the global trend . within each group",
    "we can then distinguish the states according to their level of fluctuations ( @xmath131 close to or much larger than one ) .",
    "the states arizona , georgia , and oklahoma for example have very little local contribution and their variations is dominated by the global trend . in this respect ,",
    "states such as dc , indiana are very different from the first group .",
    "more generally , we can see on this figure that states with large prevalence display very different values of @xmath161 .",
    "this result points toward the fact that describing states by their prevalence only can be very misleading and can hide important dynamical behaviors .",
    "finally , we also computed the quantities @xmath160 and @xmath131 using the ` naive ' local contribution using the national average @xmath162 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnat ] ) by @xmath163 .",
    "we represent in figure @xmath164 the difference as vectors of components given by @xmath165 and we can see on this figure that for roughly half of the states the naive calculation of the local contribution can be very misleading .",
    "in this article we adressed the crucial problem of extracting the local components of a system governed by a global trend . in this case , comparing the local signal to the average is very misleading and can lead to wrong conclusions .",
    "we applied this method to the example of crime rates series in the us and france and our analysis revealed surprising facts .",
    "the important result is about the importance of fluctuations which after the @xmath1 s in the us are governed by external factors .",
    "this result suggest that understanding the evolution of crime rates relies mostly on the identification of global socio - economical behavior and not on local effects such as state policies etc .",
    "in particular , this result could also help in understanding the decreasing trend observed in the us and which so far remains a puzzle  @xcite . in the case of obesity , we show that since the year @xmath154 , external factors dominate , and maybe more importantly that states with the same level of prevalence have very different dynamical behaviors , thus calling for the need of a detailled study state by state .",
    "however one may expect an even better signal analysis by assuming that there are several independent external trends : it will be interesting to see if our approach , combined with the more standard ica techniques , can be generalized to the case of several global trends ( a small number of sources ) .",
    "the recent availability of large amounts of data in social systems call for the need of tools able to analyze them and to extract meaningful information and we hope that our present contribution will help in the understanding of these systems where the local dynamics is superimposed to collective trends .",
