    "# 1      upper bounds on the electron ( anti- ) neutrino mass at the level of few @xmath3 are obtained from @xmath4 decay experiments @xcite , and have been confirmed by data on neutrinos from @xmath1 , collected by kamiokande - ii @xcite and imb @xcite detectors , see e.g. . concerning the masses of @xmath5 and @xmath0 ,",
    "the present experimental bounds are much less compelling : , @xcite .",
    "therefore , any approach capable of significantly lowering these limits is highly desirable .",
    "particularly , an observation sensitive to neutrino masses in the range would be extremely important for cosmological implications , see @xcite .",
    "previous analyses @xcite claimed that this goal might be reached with new generation larger detectors , for a supernova near the galactic center .      1",
    ".   which assumptions about neutrino emission are critical for observing the effects of a non - vanishing mass ? 2 .   how the analysis procedure can be optimized in order to reach the highest sensitivity to neutrino masses ? 3 .",
    "which masses for @xmath5 and @xmath0 can be actually explored with a detector such as super - kamiokande ?    in general , the determination of @xmath6-masses by means of a supernova observation is based on the comparison between the detected signal and the expected one for the case @xmath7 .",
    "a non - vanishing mass , in fact , would reflect in an overall delay of the events number distribution , and also in a spectral distortion of the signal , due to the energy dependence of the flight - time for massive neutrinos : t ( ) = d2c ( m c^2 ) ^2 where @xmath8 is the supernova distance , @xmath9 is the light speed , and @xmath10 is the neutrino energy .",
    "the greatest difficult in applying this procedure is in the dependence on the supernova model assumed to calculate the expected signal .",
    "moreover , when interested in @xmath5 and @xmath0 ( hereafter we will refer to these neutrinos , and their antiparticles , as @xmath11 ) , there is an additional problem : it is impossible to isolate their signal from that of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , because all @xmath11 detection processes ( namely neutral current reactions ) are allowed for electron neutrinos too .    on the other hand ,",
    "charged current interactions ( only possible for @xmath12 and @xmath13 at the energies of interest ) might be used to clearly identify part of the electron neutrino signal .",
    "one can thus conceive the following strategy :    1 .",
    "split , by use of a distinctive signature , the overall set of events in two classes : the first one containing only @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the second one involving all neutrino species ; 2 .",
    "use the first class of events to derive the expected distribution for @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in view of the strict limit on @xmath14",
    ", we can treat these neutrinos as massless for our purpose ( e.g. from @xcite and equation 1.1 , we get even for the lowest detectable energies , , for a sn near the galactic center ) ; 3 .   use this distribution to infer that of @xmath5 and @xmath0 , again for massless neutrinos ; 4 .   compare the observed signal with that theoretically built in the previous step and look for mass effects .",
    "we assume that only one neutrino ( say @xmath0 ) is massive and that flavor oscillations do not occur ( see @xcite and references therein for search of @xmath0 mass by use of msw effects )",
    ". the comparison should be performed in the second class of events ( ): in such a way we deal with a subset which still includes the whole @xmath11 signal , but only a part of the @xmath13 `` background '' .",
    "the residual dependence on the supernova model is essentially in step 3 : how to connect the @xmath12 and @xmath13 emission features with those of @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we extensively investigate this point , by analyzing several theoretical and phenomenological sn models and their implications for the extraction of a non - vanishing @xmath0 mass .",
    "concerning the sensitivity to neutrino mass , two points are interesting : the minimal detectable @xmath0 mass and the upper limit which can be established on @xmath15 when no positive signal comes out .",
    "correspondingly , we shall address the following questions :          the paper is organized as follows : we develop a method of data analysis , based on directional considerations ( section 2 ) which we use to determine the minimal detectable @xmath0 mass for a set of theoretical supernova models ( section 3 ) .",
    "the same analysis is repeated for a set of phenomenological models derived from @xmath1 data ( section 4 ) .",
    "we then compare our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite ( section 5 ) . finally , we calculate , both for theoretical and phenomenological models , the mass upper bound obtainable through the same method ( section 6 ) . detector characteristics , cross sections and expression for event rates are collected in the appendix .",
    "krauss _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed in 1992 a beautiful procedure of data analysis for erenkov detectors , based on directional considerations . in this section we briefly recall the idea and then we specify our approach to this method in terms of : @xmath16 the kinematical characterization of neutrino events ; @xmath17 the assumptions needed to connect the emission features of electron and other flavors neutrinos ; @xmath18 the quantitative criterion for the evidence of a non - vanishing @xmath0 mass .",
    "let us consider super - kamiokande ( sk hereafter ) , a water erenkov detector whose main characteristics are listed in the appendix , see also @xcite .",
    "neutrino events are originated basically in processes of four kinds :    1 .",

    "expressions for the cross sections are collected in the appendix .",
