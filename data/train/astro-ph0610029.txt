    "the implementation of the handshaking method is that , after the request for a state change from the  via the central server , each client sends a message containing this unique  i d , and the state it just entered , to the same  server that indicates that the state change has succeeded for this client .",

    "this includes a muon filter that looks in all directions for the signals in the detector compatible with a muon .",
    "depending on the random background rate , the filter settings can be adjusted so that the trigger rate is dominated by muons passing the sensitive volume of the detector . for an average data size of a physics signal of 2.5  kb , and an expected atmospheric muon rate of about 10  hz",
    ", the data reduction is then about  @xmath3 .",
    "the bandwidth required for the data transport scales linearly with the background photon detection rate . the data processing speed scales with some power of this rate , this power being the required minimum number of photons to identify a physics signal ( see section  [ sec : performance ] ) .",

    "the  programs alternately receive the frames belonging to the same time window from the off - shore  processes via the  server that runs on the same pc .",
    "each  program has to be finished with processing a time slicebefore it receives the next .",
    "this imposes an optimisation of the configuration of the  programs in terms of processing speed , and it determines the number of pcs required for online data processing and the specifications of these pcs .",
    "when a sufficient number of correlated single photo - electron ( spe ) hits is found that is consistent with a specific physics signal , the data are considered as a physics event , that is written to disk . the period covered by a time slice",
    "is chosen such that its duration is long compared to the duration of a physics event in the detector ( approximately 1  @xmath4s ) , in order to minimise the chance of having an event crossing the boundaries of a time slice .",
    "the algorithms implemented in the data processing software are designed to find a physics signal by looking for space - time correlations in the data . from the time of the spe hits , and the positions of the pmts ,",
    "these algorithms calculate in real time if hits could originate from light produced by this signal . in the case of standard data processing , when the muon filter is used , this is the signal produced by a muon traversing the detector .",
    "apart from the standard muon filter there are various other algorithms implemented that are used for the search for specific physics signals .",
    "the configuration of the  programs , that indicates which algorithm is used , is done by the , as described in section  [ subsec : detector_operation ] . among the presently available filter algorithms is a magnetic monopole filter , an optical beacon filter , and a directional filter .",
    "the monopole filter looks for space - time correlations in the data that are caused by particles that traverse the detector at lower speeds than a muon .",
    "the optical beacon filter is used when the optical beacons , that are attached to the detector strings , are fired .",
    "these optical beacons produce a typical light signal , that is used for time calibration .",
    "the directional filter is used when searching for a muon coming from a specific direction .",
    "this filter method takes into account the known direction of the neutrinos , and is used for astrophysical sources with known positions on the sky . for gamma - ray bursts , a subgroup of these sources ,",
    "this filter method can be used offline .",
    "the combination of the  concept , the use of an on - shore  pc farm , the specific features of gamma - ray bursts , and the information provided by external satellite triggers , make the  detector particularly sensitive to neutrinos from gamma - ray bursts  @xcite .    any other possible filter algorithm for a specific physics signal can easily be implemented in the data processing system . as the whole data processing system is implemented in software ,",
    "a new filter algorithm only involves adding the specific code and the corresponding configuration option in the database . if necessary , the computing power can be increased by adding pcs to the on - shore  system .",
    "the physics events selected by the  programs are passed via one  server to the , which formats the events and writes them to disk in root format  @xcite .",
    "these disks are located in the shore station . for each run , the data are stored in a separate file .",
    "the event files are used for the physics analyses , and are copied regularly from the shore station to a computer centre elsewhere .",
    "the performance of the daq system  has been evaluated on the basis of the operation of a prototype detector  @xcite , and has been quantified using a detailed simulation of the response of the complete detector to muons  @xcite . during periods of low bioluminescence  activity",
    "( when the average photon detection rate is 6090  khz per pmt ) all data are transmitted from the off - shore  electronics modules to the shore station .",

    "however , at higher background rates congestion of the data flow can occur at the processors in the off - shore  storey  modules .",

    "the filter programs that run on the data processing pcs have to filter the data in real time . the number of required filter programs , which corresponds to the number of data processing pcs involved in the daq system , depends mainly on the background rate in the sea .",
    "the standard muon filter is configured such that it triggers when it finds 5 or more space - time correlated level  1 hits ( two hits within 20  ns in one detector storey , or one hit with an amplitude larger than 2.5  photo - electrons ) .",
    "therefore a minimum of 10 detected photons is required to trigger an event .",
    "the trigger efficiency of this filter has been evaluated using a simulation of the detector response to muons  @xcite , and the result is shown in figure  [ fig : efficiency ] as a function of the number of detected photons for a given event .",

    "simulations have shown that with a more sophisticated trigger , this rate can be reduced to less than 1  hz , without loss of efficiency . with an expected atmospheric muon trigger rate of about 10  hz",

    "the effective dead time is then less than 165  ns , taking into account the integration gate of both ars  chips .",
    "however , at high background photon detection rates , the maximum bandwidth of the off - shore  processors is reached ( see above ) .",
    "part of the data is then lost , and this will result in a loss of the overall detection efficiency . with the prototype detectors and the first complete detector string that have been operational , significantly higher background rates than the maximum manageable background rate have been measured , especially during spring .",
    "the  daq system  has been operational since  2003 , and has been used for various systems that have been deployed in the deep - sea environment .",
    "the  concept offers a flexible data filtering system .",
    "a simulation of the detector response to muons has shown that a high detection efficiency can be achieved .",
    "the results obtained with one of the prototype detector strings have been published  @xcite . for this detector ,",
    "the data taking was more than 90% efficient during periods of low bioluminescence  activity .",
    "the daq system  has also been used to read out the first complete detector string . by enlarging the on - shore  computer farm ,",
    "the same system will be used to read out the complete detector , that will consist of twelve detector strings .",
