    "the advance of precision laser spectroscopy of atomic and molecular systems has , over the past decades , been closely connected to the development of experimental techniques such as tunable laser technology  @xcite , saturation spectroscopy  @xcite , two - photon doppler - free spectroscopy  @xcite , cavity - locking techniques  @xcite , and ultimately , the invention of the frequency comb laser  @xcite , developments to which prof .",

    "these inventions are being exploited to further investigate at ever - increasing precision the benchmark atomic system  the hydrogen atom , evinced by the advance in spectroscopic accuracy of atomic hydrogen measurements by more than seven orders of magnitude since the invention of the laser @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy of the 1s-2s transition in atomic hydrogen , at @xmath10 relative accuracy @xcite , provides a stringent test of fundamental physical theories , in particular quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "currently , the theoretical comparison to precision measurements on atomic hydrogen are limited by uncertainties in the proton charge radius @xmath11 .",
    "the finding that the @xmath11-value obtained from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy is in disagreement by some 7-@xmath12 @xcite is now commonly referred to as the _ proton - size puzzle_.    molecular hydrogen , both the neutral and ionic varieties , are benchmark systems in molecular physics , in analogy to its atomic counterpart .",
    "present developments in the _ ab initio _ theory of the two - electron neutral  molecule and the one - electron ionic  molecule , as well as the respective isotopologues , have advanced in accuracy approaching that of its atomic counterpart despite the increased complexity .",
    "the most accurate level energies of the entire set of rotational and vibrational states in the ground electronic state of  were calculated by komasa et al .",
    "an important breakthrough in these theoretical studies was the inclusion of higher - order relativistic and qed contributions , along with a systematic assessment of the uncertainties in the calculation .",

    "molecular spectroscopy might thus be posed to contribute towards the resolution of the proton - size puzzle .",
    "in contrast to atomic structure , the added molecular complexity due to the vibrational and rotational nuclear degrees of freedom could constitute an important feature , with a multitude of transitions ( in the ground electronic state ) that can be conscripted towards the confrontation of theory and experiments . from both experimental and theoretical perspectives ,",

    "the production of excited  offers a unique possibility on populating the high - lying vibrational states , that would otherwise be practically inaccessible by thermodynamic means ( corresponding temperature of @xmath19 k for @xmath1 ) .    here , we present measurements of level energies of @xmath1 rovibrational quantum states that extend the spectroscopy in ref .",

    "this is achieved by the use of a resonant ionization step to molecular rydberg states , thereby enhancing the detection efficiency significantly .",
    "the enhancement allows for the use of a low intensity spectroscopy laser minimizing the effect of ac - stark induced broadening and shifting of lines .",
    "the ac - stark effect is identified as the major source of systematic uncertainty in the measurements , and a detailed treatment of this phenomenon is also included in this contribution .",
