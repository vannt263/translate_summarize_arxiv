    "in recent years , random tessellation theory has been an active field of research .",
    "whereas in the past mainly mean values and their relations were considered , current research focuses on second - order parameters , limit theorems and distributional results , see @xcite to mention only a few .",
    "besides the classical poisson hyperplane and poisson - voronoi tessellations , random tessellations constructed by subsequent cell division have attracted particular interest in recent times in stochastic geometry and spatial statistics ( see @xcite and especially @xcite and the references cited therein ) . among these models ,",
    "the so - called stit tessellations ( which are * st*able under * it*eration , see below ) introduced in @xcite are of particular interest , because of the number of analytically available results @xcite , @xcite@xcite and @xcite@xcite , see figure [ figstit ] for illustrations .",
    "the model shows the potential to become a new reference model for crack or fissure structures .",
    "is concentrated with equal weight on three orthogonal directions ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   is concentrated with equal weight on three orthogonal directions ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    after a detailed analysis of planar stit tessellations in @xcite , in the present paper the @xmath0-dimensional case is considered .",
    "we study so - called _ i - segments _ in homogeneous three - dimensional stit tessellations , which form the one - dimensional building blocks of a stit tessellation .",
    "they appear in the course of the sequential cell splitting procedure when cells are divided by new planes .",
    "in fact , all sides ( @xmath1-faces ) of a dividing two - dimensional polygon  which will be referred to as an _ i - polygon _  are called i - segments . in principle the distribution of the number of vertices in the relative interior of the _ typical _ i - segment is in the focus of this paper . regarding the spatio - temporal construction ,",
    "it becomes evident that this number depends on the birth time , the direction and on the length of the i - segment .",
    "but it also depends on the birth time of that i - polygon , in whose interior the i - segment under consideration arises at a later time .",
    "this polygon is called the _ carrying i - polygon _ of the i - segment . at its birth time , this i - polygon is a facet of two adjacent mosaic cells and during the cell division process these cells can undergo further subdivision and in this way new vertices and edges within the carrying i - polygon can appear , see figure [ figpolygon ] .",
    "for this reason we consider the edges in the carrying i - polygon ( dark grey ) and observe that an i - segment can have intersections with already existing edges ( light coloured lines in the dark grey polygon ) at the moment of its birth , see figure [ figpolygon ] .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the planar case @xcite and causes that their analysis is considerably more involved .",
    "further vertices can arise after the birth of the typical i - segment as an effect of the ongoing cell division procedure .",
    "for deriving an explicit formula for the probability that a fixed number of vertices is located in the relative interior of the typical i - segment , we need to study at first the marked process of i - segments with the following marks : length , direction and birth time of the i - segment and birth time of the carrying i - polygon .",
    "we will describe the joint and all marginal distributions of the marks associated to the typical and for the length - weighted typical i - segment of a homogeneous spatial stit tessellation .",
    "moreover , by noting that such a spatial tessellation has exactly two different types of vertices ( see figure [ figknoten ] ) we can refine our result and obtain the joint distribution of the numbers of vertices of both types in the relative interior of the typical i - segment .",
    "note that it would also be interesting to calculate the distribution of the number of vertices within the typical @xmath2-dimensional building block , i.e. the typical i - polygon .",
    "however , this quantity is currently not accessible , because to this end the area distribution of a typical poisson polygon is needed . to determine this distribution is a long - standing open problem in stochastic geometry .",
    "as already mentioned , related problems in the planar case have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the results obtained there have led to a deeper understanding of planar stit tessellations and were used to obtain new results about their structure . in a companion paper",
    "@xcite we also use the results of the present work to explore in more detail the combinatorial structure of spatial stit tessellations , a study initiated in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secgeneral ] we introduce some notation , recall the basic construction of stit tessellations and rephrase some of their most important properties , which are needed for our later arguments . the conceptual framework as well as",
    "our main results are contained in section [ secresults ] .",
    "the proofs are the content of section [ secproofs ] .",
    "in this section we explain our basic notation , the construction and the main properties of stit tessellations that are needed for our arguments below . although our results are dealing with the three - dimensional case , we focus in this section on general space dimensions , because in our proofs we apply some of the properties also to lower - dimensional tessellations",
    ".      a _ tessellation _ of @xmath3 with @xmath4 can be described in two ways : as a locally finite collection of non - overlapping and space - filling compact convex polytopes ( called _ cells _ in the sequel ) , as well as a closed subset of @xmath3 , which is formed by the union of all cell boundaries .",
    "we switch between both perspectives arbitrarily .    in this paper",
    "we will deal with _",
    "random _ tessellations of @xmath3 , which can be regarded as random variables taking values in the measurable space of tessellations of @xmath3 , see @xcite for a detailed definition and in particular for measurability issues .",
    "our attention will be restricted to _ homogeneous _ ( spatially stationary ) random tessellations , i.e. random tessellation whose distribution is invariant under spatial translations .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the set of all hyperplanes in @xmath6",
    ". a hyperplane @xmath7 will be parametrized by its normal direction @xmath8 ( the upper unit half - sphere in @xmath3 ) and its signed distance @xmath9 to the origin , where the distance is defined as positive iff the projection of the origin @xmath10 onto @xmath11 is located in the upper half - space .",
    "such a hyperplane is denoted by @xmath12 . for @xmath13",

    "invariance under translations implies that @xmath18 factorizes , i.e. there is a constant @xmath21 and a probability measure @xmath22 on @xmath23 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the lebesgue measure on @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 is the uniform distribution on @xmath28 and @xmath29 , then @xmath18 corresponds to the isometry - invariant hyperplane measure @xmath30 , cf .",
    "@xcite . from now on we assume @xmath29 in the factorization ( [ factorization ] ) .",
    "moreover , to avoid degenerated cases we assume that @xmath27 is not concentrated on a great half - subsphere of @xmath28 , i.e. we require @xmath31 .",
    "a formal and detailed description of stit tessellations in bounded windows is given in @xcite .",
    "here we explain the construction in an intuitive way only .",
    "let @xmath18 be a hyperplane measure as above and @xmath32 a bounded convex polytope .",
    "we assign to @xmath33 a random lifetime and on expiry of this lifetime , we choose a random hyperplane , which splits @xmath33 into two polyhedral sub - cells @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the construction continues now independently and recursively in both of the sub - cells @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which is to say that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are provided with independent random lifetimes and that they are divided by random hyperplanes when they die .",
    "note that the hyperplanes are always chopped - off by the boundary of their respective mother cells .",
    "this repeated cell division is continued until a fixed deterministic time threshold @xmath36 is reached .",
    "the random tessellation constructed until time @xmath37 within @xmath33 is denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "in order to ensure the temporal markov property of the described cell splitting process , we assume that the lifetimes of the cells are conditionally ( given the cells at a certain time ) independent and exponentially distributed .",
    "moreover , we assume that the parameter of this exponential lifetime distribution of a cell @xmath39 is given by @xmath40)$ ] ( and thus the parameters of the exponential distributions of different cells are not independent ) . in the special case @xmath41",
    "we have that @xmath42)$ ] is proportional to the integral - geometric mean width of @xmath39 .",
    "note that this choice ensures that smaller cells live stochastically longer .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the hyperplane splitting a cell @xmath39 is chosen according to the law @xmath40)^{-1}\\lambda(\\cdot\\cap [ c])$ ] .",
    "we summarize here those properties of stit tessellations that are needed in our arguments below .",
    "for further background on stit tessellations we refer the reader to @xcite and to @xcite for a general introduction to stochastic geometry .",
    "if we insert independent copies @xmath43 of the tessellation @xmath44 into the cells @xmath39 of @xmath45 ( generating @xmath46 ) , the resulting _ iterated _ or _ nested tessellation _ is denoted by @xmath47 considered as a random closed set , @xmath38 satisfies the following    * [ spatial consistency ] * the random tessellation @xmath38 is spatially consistent in that for any convex @xmath48 with @xmath33 as in subsection [ secnotation ] we have @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 stands for equality in distribution ) .",

    "in this section we present our main results in theorem [ thm ] , theorem [ thm3 ] , theorem [ thm2 ] and their corollaries .",
    "before we can state them , we have to introduce further notation and the framework of our work .",
    "the notion of i - segments is due to r. miles and characterizes one of the types of line segments associated with a random planar tessellation that is not face - to - face , cf . @xcite and",
    "the references cited therein .",
    "i - segment _ can be defined as a maximal union of collinear and connected line segments that appear in the edge - skeleton of a tessellation .",

    "i - polygon _ is a maximal union of coplanar and convex planar polygons ( subsets of a plane in @xmath70 ) . here , ` maximal ' is understood in the sense that there is no extension to a larger collinear ( coplanar ) and convex set in the tessellation ( considered as the closed set of cell boundaries ) .    in terms of the spatio - temporal construction of stit tessellations @xmath45 , the i - segments and i - polygons in spatial stit tessellations",
    "can be characterized as follows .",
    "any i - polygon of @xmath45 is a cell - dividing planar polygon introduced until time @xmath37 , and any i - segment is a side ( @xmath1-face ) of an i - polygon .",
    "when a cell @xmath39 is divided by a plane @xmath71 $ ] , exactly one i - polygon @xmath72 is born , whereas at least three i - segments are born simultaneously .",
    "any of these i - segments is the intersection of the i - polygon @xmath72 with a facet ( @xmath2-face ) of the cell @xmath39 .",
    "this facet itself is embedded in a ( possibly larger ) previously born i - polygon , which is called the _ carrying i - polygon _ of the i - segment .    for our purposes it will be appropriate to describe the joint distribution of the following marks associated to an i - segment in @xmath45 : @xmath73 here @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the length , direction and the birth time of the i - segment , respectively , and @xmath76 is the birth time of the carrying i - polygon .",
    "note that the direction of a segment is the unique unit vector in @xmath77 parallel to the segment .",
    "consider for fixed time @xmath36 and measure @xmath18 the homogeneous stit tessellation @xmath45 .",
    "then the process of the _ marked _ i - segments of @xmath45 with marks as in ( [ defmarks ] ) is a homogeneous marked segment process .",
    "thus , palm calculus for marked point processes can be applied and allows to define the distribution of the _ typical i - segment _ and its _ mark distribution _ ,",
    "see @xcite and also section [ secproofs ] below . in intuitive terms , the typical i - segment and its mark distribution can be regarded as a randomly ( equally likely ) chosen i - segment of @xmath38 together with its random marks when @xmath33 is a ` large ' observation window .    in the following we use the indicator function notation @xmath78 , which is @xmath1 if the statement in brackets is fulfilled and @xmath79 otherwise .",
