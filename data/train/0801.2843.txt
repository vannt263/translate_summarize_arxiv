    "recently , georgi @xcite pointed out an interesting possibility for the existence of a scale - invariant sector with a continuous mass distribution .",
    "this scale invariant stuff was coined the term `` unparticle '' to describe a possible scale - invariant hidden sector sitting at an infrared fixed point at a high scale @xmath6 .",
    "the scale - invariant sector may be weakly or strongly interacting but its effects on the standard model ( sm ) is assumed to be weakly interacting . in georgi",
    "s scheme @xcite , the hidden sector communicates with the sm content via a messenger sector characterized by a high mass scale @xmath7 . at energy below @xmath7 , one can integrate out the messenger sector and ends up with effective operators suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath7 in the following form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent local operators of the sm and hidden sector with scaling dimensions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "as one scales down the theory from @xmath7 , the hidden sector may flow to an infrared fixed point at the scale @xmath6 , which is generated by quantum effects via dimensional transmutation for example .",
    "at the fixed point the hidden sector becomes scale invariant , the above operator eq .",
    "( [ effectiveop ] ) has to be replaced by a new set of operators of similar form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the unparticle operator with a scaling dimension @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the unknown coefficient . due to",
    "the underlying theory is a scale invariant interacting theory , the scaling dimension @xmath15 needs not having the canonical values of integer or half - integer like the free boson or free fermion cases .",
    "besides its scaling dimension , the unparticle operator @xmath14 can be characterized by scalar , vector , tensor , or spinor etc according to its lorentz group representation .    despite the scale invariant sector remains unspecified , the 2-point function @xcite and the feynman propagator @xcite of the unparticle field operator @xmath17 can be determined by scale invariance .",
    "the normalization of the 2-point function of unparticle operator of scaling dimension @xmath15 was fixed by georgi @xcite to be the same as the phase space of @xmath15 massless particles . on the other hand ,",
    "the most peculiar feature of the unparticle propagator is a phase factor @xmath2 associated only with time - like momenta .",
    "this cp - conserving phase has been shown to have interesting interference effects at high energy experiments @xcite and other phenomenology .    in this work ,",
    "we consider photon - photon scattering via unparticle exchanges .",
    "the sm contribution to photon - photon scattering can only arise from loop diagrams with all charged particle running around the loop and thus is highly suppressed .",
    "it is anticipated that the cross section due to unparticle exchange can easily surpass the sm cross section at high enough energies , because exchanges of unparticle are at the tree - level . moreover , photon scatters via unparticle exchanges in all @xmath3- , @xmath4- , and @xmath5-channels .",
    "the peculiar phase @xmath2 associated with the @xmath3-channel exchange gives rise to interesting interference with the @xmath4- and @xmath5-channel amplitudes .",
    "similar effects had been studied in the model of large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "note that similar ideas for the spin-0 unparticle have been pursued recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , our analytic results disagree with ref .",
    "we suspect that the phase factor @xmath2 associated with the @xmath3-channel unparticle propagator was not taken care of properly .",
    "our results are consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite where we overlap .",
    "in addition , we extend these previous calculations to the spin-2 unparticle exchange , which is highly nontrivial .    it has been pointed out recently by grinstein _",
    "et al _ @xcite that the vector and tensor unparticle propagators for a conformal invariant hidden sector differ from a scale invariant ones .",
    "unitarity constraints @xcite on the scaling dimensions of the unparticle operators with conformal symmetry are also emphasized in their work @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we follow the original georgi s scheme by assuming just scale invariance in the derivation of the unparticle propagators .",
    "integrating out the heavy messenger sector can also lead to contact interactions among sm fields of the form @xmath18 and they can compete with the effects from unparticle exchanges @xcite .",
    "for example , the following two dimension 8 operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be induced and they can also contribute to the elastic photon - photon scattering .",
    "we assume the coefficients of these operators are minuscule and ignore them in our analysis .",
    "a complete analysis for the photon - photon scattering including all the interference effects among the sm contribution , unparticle exchanges as well as these contact interactions is interesting but beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give in details the scattering amplitudes for @xmath21 via spin-0 as well as spin-2 unparticle exchange . in sec .",
    "iii , we compare the unparticle contribution with the sm contribution in the angular distribution and in the total cross section .",
    "we also look into the nontrivial effects of the phase @xmath2 of the @xmath3-channel propagator .",
    "we conclude in sec . iv .",
    "the interaction of spin-0 unparticle @xmath22 with the photon can be parameterized by @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an unknown coefficient of order @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the field strength of the photon field .",
    "the unparticle propagator is @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 the peculiar phase associated with the propagator arises from the negative sign in front of @xmath30 in eq.([unpropagator ] ) : @xmath31 therefore , the @xmath3-channel propagator has the nontrivial phase @xmath2 while the @xmath4- and @xmath5-channel propagators do not .",
    "there are three feynman diagrams contributing to @xmath32 with the unparticle exchanges in @xmath3- , @xmath4- , and @xmath5-channels .",
    "the sum of amplitudes for these three diagrams is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 in the above amplitude , we can write the mandelstam variables as @xmath35 such that the phase @xmath36 associates manifestly with the @xmath3-channel only .",
    "it is obvious that each channel is separately gauge invariant .",
    "the square of the amplitude averaged over initial polarizations is given by @xmath37 + ( |t| |u|)^{d_{{\\cal u } } } \\biggr\\ } \\;.\\ ] ] if the phase factor @xmath38 were removed , the amplitude squared would have been symmetric in @xmath39 .",
    "note that we have written the mandelstam variables as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the central scattering angle .",
    "the angular distribution is given by @xmath44   + \\left ( \\frac{1 -\\cos^2\\theta}{4 } \\right ) ^{d_{{\\cal u } } }   \\biggr \\ } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the range of integration for @xmath45 is from @xmath46 to 1 .",
    "the total cross section can be obtained analytically in closed form by integrating eq.([dsigmadcos ] ) over @xmath45 , viz . , @xmath47 the effective interaction of spin-2 unparticle with the photon is given by @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an unknown effective coupling constant , of order @xmath25 .",
    "using the feynman rules and the propagator derived in @xcite , the matrix element squared for elastic photon - photon scattering via spin-2 unparticle exchange is found to be @xmath50 + 2 \\left ( t u \\right)^{d_{{\\cal u}}- 2 } s^4 \\biggr\\ } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath51 , the above expression is proportional to @xmath52 which is the familiar result @xcite for the spin-2 kaluza - klein graviton exchange in the large extra dimensions model .",
    "however , the @xmath3-channel unparticle exchange contains a cp - conserving phase factor @xmath2 that does not share with the @xmath4- and @xmath5-channels .",
    "therefore , the expressions of eq.([msqspin0 ] ) and eq.([msqspin2 ] ) for the matrix element squared contain the factor @xmath53 in the interference terms between @xmath3- and @xmath4- and between @xmath3- and @xmath5-channels .",
    "this is a unique feature of the unparticle .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=480 ]   normalized angular distributions of @xmath54 via spin-0 and spin-2 unparticle exchanges for various @xmath15 at @xmath55 tev . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=480 ]    in fig.[norm - angular ] , we show the normalized angular distributions @xmath56 at @xmath55 tev for spin-0 and spin-2 unparticle exchanges .",
    "note that in the part for spin-0 the scale on the @xmath57-axis is linear while that for spin-2 the scale is logarithmic . therefore , in general the spin-2 exchange will give much larger contributions in the forward region .",
    "another interesting feature is that for spin-0 case when @xmath15 increases from @xmath58 to @xmath59 the distribution is becoming more forward .",
    "this is because the factors of @xmath60 and @xmath61 only appear in the numerator , and so when @xmath15 increases , more powers of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are contributing in the forward region . on the other hand , for spin-2 case more powers of @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    "appear in the denominator as @xmath15 is closer to @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the distribution is much more forward for small @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , it diverges at @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "we have also verified that the term containing the factor @xmath38 is affecting the distribution .",
    "if there were no such a factor , the distribution would have been different , especially for small @xmath15 .",
    "this demonstrates the effect of the peculiar phase associated with the @xmath3-channel propagator only .",
    "if the phase were associated with all @xmath65 propagators , the effect would have been canceled out when we squared the amplitude .",

    "we also show the expectation from the sm , using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite with the form factors from ref .",
    "@xcite . since the sm cross section peaks in the forward and backward directions , we impose an angular cut of @xmath68 to reduce the sm cross section .",
    "it is easy to see that the unparticle cross sections can surpass the sm one at high enough energy depending on the spin and scaling dimension of the unparticle .",
    "the factor containing @xmath38 also affects the total cross sections to some extent , especially for small @xmath15 .",
    "one of the most peculiar features of unparticle is the phase factor @xmath2 associated with the @xmath3-channel propagator .",
    "we have studied its effect in @xmath54 , which would have been symmetric in @xmath3- , @xmath4- , and @xmath5-channels without the phase factor . however , since the phase is only associated with the @xmath3-channel , the effect will show up in the interference terms between @xmath3- and @xmath4- and between @xmath3- and @xmath5-channels .",
    "the effect of such a factor affects the angular distribution and total cross sections to some significance , especially for small @xmath15 .",
    "we have also shown that the scattering cross sections due to unparticle exchanges easily surpass the sm contribution .",
    "thus , the possibility of studying photon scattering in the future linear collider , using either laser backscattering technique or bremsstrahlung , is important to test the existence of any tree - level photon - photon scattering .",
    "unparticle is a unique example that allows tree - level exchange and contains a special cp - conserving phase factor @xmath2 solely in the @xmath3-channel propagator to facilitate interesting interference effects .",
