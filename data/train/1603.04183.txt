    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) with their powerful emission processes are observed up to high redshifts , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a significant progress in studying grb observations has been the advent of _ swift _ satellite @xcite , which has revealed a more complex behavior of the light curves @xcite than in the past .",
    "there are several emission models proposed in the literature providing predictions for characteristic grb light curve features .",
    "well known is the model of @xcite , consisting of jet internal shocks generating the grb prompt phase emission and external shocks of the grb expanding fireball generating the afterglow emission .    in the present paper",
    "we study distributions of the grb afterglow parameters versus light curve temporal decay indices @xmath0 , for the power - law decay observed in the afterglow phase , with the x - ray luminosity @xmath3 .",
    "we analyze an extended sample of 176 grbs with known redshifts observed by _",
    "swift _ from january 2005 to july 2014 . in the presented analysis we use the lt correlation @xcite , updated in @xcite , between the derived characteristic afterglow plateau luminosity , @xmath3 , and time , @xmath4 ( an index  * indicates the grb rest frame quantity ) .",
    "an attempt to study similar afterglow properties was presented by @xcite .",
    "they analyzed the  late \" light curve properties at the time of 1 day after the burst to reveal existence of grouping the grb luminosities into two groups which also differ in their redshift distributions . in their study",
    "they noted relations among some grb parameters , in particular a non - trivial distribution of x - ray spectral indices versus the light curve temporal decay indices , but no dependence of these indices on the grb luminosity .",
    "in addition , prompt - afterglow correlations have been studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "importance of the present study results also from the fact that the afterglow lt correlation has already been the object of theoretical modeling either via accretion @xcite , via a magnetar model @xcite or energy injection @xcite and there were attempts to apply it as a cosmological tool @xcite . here , we extend the lt correlation study looking into its possible dependence on the additional physical parameter @xmath0 characterizing the afterglow light curve .    below , in section 2 we introduce the data set analyzed in this study .",
    "in section 3 we describe the performed observational data analysis and the derived distributions of decay indices @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis reveals a weak correlation for @xmath0 and @xmath3 , but a significant systematic trend along the correlated ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) distribution . in section 4",
    "we present final discussion and conclusions .",
    "we shortly consider physical interpretation of the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "then , we preliminary explore a new possibility of using grbs as cosmological standard candles , illustrated with a proposed toy model involving scaling grb afterglow luminosity to the selected standard @xmath8 .",
    "the fitted slopes and normalization parameters of the correlations presented in this paper are derived using the @xcite method .",
    "the @xmath9cdm cosmology applied here uses the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12  .",
    "below , we analyze distribution of afterglow light curve decay indices , @xmath0 , for the data set of 176 grbs with known redshifts , observed by _ swift _ from january 2005 to july 2014 . within this sample",
    "we consider separately subsamples of 139 long grbs , 25 x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) , 12 short grbs with extended emission . the sample of 164 long grbs and xrfs is also considered together as a single sample .",
    "as described in @xcite , all the analyzed light curves were fitted using an analytic functional form proposed by @xcite .",
    "the considered sample was chosen from all _ swift _ grbs with known redshifts by selecting only those events which allowed a reliable afterglow fitting .",
    "the fits provided physical parameters for the grb afterglows , including its characteristic luminosity and time , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , at the end of the afterglow plateau phase , and the power - law temporal decay index , @xmath2 , for the afterglow decaying phase .",
    "the fitted indices @xmath2 are influenced by the requirement of the best global light curve fitting for the considered analytic model .",
    "therefore , we decided to apply a different procedure for the derivation of the temporal decay index @xmath0 to be used in the following analysis , intended to provide a more accurate fit of the light curve power - law decay part immediately after the plateau . in each grb",
    "we selected the afterglow light curve section with a power - law and we performed the @xmath13 fitting of @xmath0 in such a range , as presented in the on line material including a set of figures for all grbs showing the performed fits and providing the fitting parameters in the table .",
    "we compared these parameters with those by @xcite and the ones quoted in the swift burst analyser ( http://www.swift.ac.uk/burst@xmath14analyser/ ) , having nearly the same @xmath0 values in the majority of cases .",
    "however , also significant differences are found in individual cases due to the different time ranges considered for the fits .    the applied procedure allowed to remove all clear deviations of the power - law from the fitting due to flares and non - uniformities in the observational data . in the case of a break in the decaying part of the light curve",
    ", a value of @xmath0 was fitted to the brighter / earlier part of the light curve .",
    "we have to note that in some rare cases it was impossible to decide if the first part of the light curve can be considered the decaying part , or still a steep plateau phase , and the presented fits can be disputed .",
    "we decided to use all derived data in the analysis and correlations studied in this paper , leaving possibility of some particular data selection and/or rejecting some events from the analysis to the future study .",
    "comparison of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows that both measured decay indices have similar distributions , but differences for individual fitted values can be significant .",
    "the parameters of the gaussian fits for both presented distributions are : a mean value @xmath15 with standard deviation @xmath16 for our power - law fitting compared to @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the willingale model fitting .",
    "the p - value of the t - test between these two distributions is 0.89 , indicating no statistically significant differences between the two distributions .",
    "by adopting the analyzed subsample of long grbs+xrfs , systematic trends in the ( @xmath19 , @xmath0 ) distribution can be studied . as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , there is an indication that these quantities are ( weakly ) correlated .",
    "however , scatter of points around the correlation line is substantial and the derived spearman @xcite correlation coefficient @xmath20 is small .",
    "the fitted correlation line is @xmath19 = @xmath21 + @xmath22 , showing that _ on average _ faster light curve decay seems to occur for grbs with higher luminosities .",
    "however , here we stress again , the trend is weak in this highly scattered distribution .",
    "the same analysis using the long grbs subsample only leads to a slightly weaker correlation with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "versus @xmath0 for the long grbs+xrfs subsample .",
    "the line presents a fitted weak correlation . ]",
    "it should be noted that the large scatter of the grb luminosity distribution can not be due only to the fitting method used for its derivation .",
    "significant contribution to this scatter must result from the very nature of the grb sources , possibly modified by the explosion geometry .    in the attempt to evaluate the trend in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we decided to compare distributions of @xmath0 plotted for three luminosity ranges with equal numbers of grbs : a low luminosity range  @xmath25 , a medium range ",
    "@xmath26 , and a high range  @xmath27 .",
    "normalized cumulative distributions function @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , where summing includes all grbs with @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the number of grbs in the considered sample ) approximates the cumulative probability function in the @xmath0 space .",
    "below , in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we present these functions in the 3 analyzed luminosity ranges for the whole grbs sample , as well as for long grbs , short grbs and xrfs subsamples .",
    "comparison of the red and blue cdf distributions presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] convincingly ( maybe less convincingly for the short subsample ) supports the existence of the ( @xmath19 , @xmath0 ) correlation .",
    "the same systematics for all analyzed grb samples with lower luminosity events show tendency to slower light curve decay .",
    "the most luminous grbs ( blue lines ) seem to grow faster to unity with their smaller @xmath32 scatter . this result",
    "is also confirmed by the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "the test applied for low ( red line ) and high ( blue line ) luminosity grb distributions along the @xmath0 coordinate ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) shows that it is highly unlikely , with @xmath33 , that both distributions are drawn randomly from the same population . as regards the xrfs and short grbs subsamples , the available number of elements is too low for establishing reliable statistical results , however the distributions of brighter grbs seem to show the same tendency to be centered at higher @xmath0 values than the dimmer ones .    , versus @xmath0 for the analyzed grb subsamples in 3 considered luminosity ranges : @xmath25 ( red ) , @xmath26 ( green ) and @xmath27 ( blue ) . ]     for the analyzed subsamples in 3 considered luminosity ranges : @xmath25 ( red ) , @xmath26 ( green ) and @xmath27 ( blue ) . in each @xmath34",
    "bin the data for the different luminosity ranges are plotted as ( shifted within the considered bin ) separate color bars . ]    there is no well understood universal recipe yet for differentiating the physical properties of the grb source from observational data , but the existence of @xmath19 versus @xmath35 correlation reflects the presence of @xmath36 uniformly varying properties of grb progenitor in the plateau phase . if these properties would be the grb progenitor mass and/or its angular momentum , then different external medium profiles could be expected around the exploding massive star , where the afterglow related shock propagates .",
    "therefore , it may be expected to detect more clear dependence between the afterglow luminosity and the @xmath0 index for grbs analyzed within a limited range of @xmath4 .",
    "to proceed , in analogy to the above analysis for selected luminosity ranges , we study relative distributions of grb subsamples along the lt distribution in three ranges of the decay index : the  slowly \" decaying light curves with @xmath37 , the  intermediate \" ones with @xmath38 and the  fast \" decaying light curves with @xmath39 . with such selection",
    "each subsample has the same size .    , @xmath35 ) plane for the three selected @xmath0 subsamples : @xmath37 ( red ) , @xmath38 ( green ) and @xmath40 ( blue ) . the black line represents the lt correlation line fitted for all presented grbs . ]",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , presenting the considered long grbs+xrfs @xmath0-subsamples distributed along the lt correlation line , clearly reveals separation among these distributions .",
    "this behavior is also well visible in the normalized cumulative distribution functions plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "in particular , in fig . [ fig:6 ] the considered samples ( all , long grbs and long grbs+xrfs ) are presented with respect to the ratio of the grb afterglow luminosity @xmath41 to the respective luminosity @xmath42 at the fitted correlation line : in the logarithmic scale @xmath43 = @xmath19 - @xmath44  .",
    "a significant trend between the relative luminosity , @xmath43 , and @xmath0 is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , leading , e.g. to negligible ks probability , @xmath45 , that the low and high @xmath0 subsamples are randomly drawn from a single grb population .     versus @xmath43 for the analyzed grb subsamples in 3 considered @xmath0 ranges : @xmath37 ( red ) , @xmath38 ( green ) and @xmath40 ( blue ) . ]     for the long grbs+xrfs subsamples , for the three @xmath0 ranges : @xmath37 ( red ) , @xmath38 ( green ) and @xmath40 ( blue ) . ]    in fig .",

    "only , the correlation has a slightly smaller slope ( 0.42 ) with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "the red line presents the fitted correlation ( see eq .",
    "1 ) . ]    to better evaluate the errors of the parameters fitted for the analyzed grb sample , we decided to perform an additional statistical analysis using the monte carlo modeling of the data with @xmath51 simulations in each case . for each grb",
    "we consider parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath0 to have gaussian distributions around the fitted values , with the distribution width given by the respective 1 @xmath52 uncertainty .",
    "then , we randomly selected from the considered grb sample - using a bootstrap procedure - the samples to be analyzed , where each grb parameter was drawn from the respective gaussian distribution . for each randomly created data sample we derived the correlation coefficient and the correlation slope by fitting the respective correlation @xmath43 vs. @xmath0 .",
    "as presented in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : * ] , the simulations fully confirm reality of the derived correlation .",
    "we find that within the measurement errors existing correlation coefficient should be approximately between @xmath53 ( mean value 0.35 ) and the fitted @xmath43 vs. @xmath0 correlation should have an inclination @xmath54 ( mean value 0.41 ) , in agreement with the fitted errors in eq . ( 1 ) .    using similar simulations as above ,",
    "it can also be independently checked the possibility of randomly obtaining the studied @xmath43 vs. @xmath0 correlation if no systematic relation of @xmath0 in respect to @xmath3 and @xmath4 exists .",
    "we performed such analysis by randomly drawing samples using the procedure above , again within the bootstrap scheme , but with separately drawing pairs of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 from the grb sample , and the @xmath0 values from the sample of these values for the considered grbs .",
    "such procedure removes any correlation between @xmath0 and other grb parameters in the sample and shows that the possibility of randomly obtaining the correlation coefficient found in the real data is negligible ( fig .",

    "analysis of the fitted afterglow power - law temporal decay indices for the subsample of long grbs+xrfs reveals a weak trend towards a steeper decay phase for higher afterglow luminosity @xmath3 .",
    "the trend turns into a significant correlation if we consider grb afterglow luminosity scaled to the one expected from the fitted lt correlation , for a given grb afterglow plateau end time @xmath4 .",
    "as different @xmath4 values result from varying properties of the grb sources , the present analysis can be used to get new insight into physical nature of such sources .",
    "it is worth to note the attempts in the literature to provide physical interpretation of @xmath19 versus @xmath0 relation .",
    "we can refer to such model presented by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in order to relate the considered @xmath0 parameter to the microphysics of the reverse shock emission . in the model of hascoet",
    "et al . the energy deposition rate , @xmath56 , in the grb afterglow , varied in time ` @xmath57 ' with a power - law dependence on the lorentz gamma factor , @xmath58 :      where the energy scale @xmath60 is determined by the total energy injected in the afterglow phase ; @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the power - law indices for the time dependence of the energy injection rate . in this model",
    "the @xmath61 parameter constraints the shape of the plateau phase , while @xmath62 carries information about the light curve temporal decay index after the plateau .",
    "the characteristic value of @xmath63 sets the duration of the plateau . with the assumed power - law radial distribution of the medium surrounding the grb progenitor ,",
    "the lorentz factor evolves as      where , e.g. , @xmath65 for a uniform medium and @xmath66 for a stellar wind .",
    "hascoet et al . derived the light curve temporal decay indices before ( @xmath67 ) and after ( @xmath68 ) the break at the end of the plateau phase as      so that the flat plateau phase should be present for @xmath70 , i.e. close to @xmath71 in the uniform medium and @xmath72 in the wind case . in the presented example",
    "@xcite considered the temporal decay index after the plateau @xmath73 , leading to @xmath74 and the parameters of the central engine energy deposition in the late afterglow stage @xmath75 and 2 , for the uniform medium and the wind case , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that this example uses the @xmath68 value very close to the mean value of our distribution , @xmath76 , as visible in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we should remark here that the observed large scatter in the @xmath0 distribution seems to be difficult to be explained only by variations of the source radial density profile , influencing the shock propagation .",
    "therefore , we consider the present discussion only as an example of the study based on the @xmath0 parameter measurements .      as the second aspect of the present study , we consider a possible usage of the measured afterglow light curve @xmath0 for physically differentiating the observed grbs .",
    "e.g. , the revealed @xmath77 versus @xmath0 correlation can be used to search for the procedure which could enable the standardization of grbs and eventually to reveal a new cosmological standard candle . as an _ illustrative toy model _",
    ", for such approach we introduce a procedure for grbs resembling the one used for the standardization of sn ia light curves by using the so called phillips relation between the peak magnitude and the `` stretching parameter '' @xcite . in an attempt to scale grbs with different temporal decay indices @xmath0 to the standard source properties",
    ", we define the standard grb as the one characterized by the value of the temporal decay index @xmath78 , approximately the mean value of the distribution presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "further , we postulate that the expected  standardized \" grb luminosity , @xmath79 , can be derived using its measured decay index @xmath0 and by scaling it to @xmath8 using eq . 1 :      this procedure applied for all the events in the analyzed subsample of long grbs+xrfs results in only a slight increase in the lt correlation coefficient absolute value , from @xmath81 for the original ( @xmath19 , @xmath35 ) data to @xmath82 for the modified distribution ( @xmath83 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "when using the long grbs subsample only the increase in the correlation coefficient is even smaller .",
    "this increase in the correlation coefficient is obtained by the fits for quite different shapes of the afterglow light curves and thus different quality of available grb parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "more detailed analysis of this standardization procedure , with careful consideration of the afterglow light curves for the selected events , is in progress now .",

    "<S> in this work we study the distribution of temporal power - law decay indices , @xmath0 , in the gamma ray burst ( grb ) afterglow phase , fitted for @xmath1 grbs ( 139 long grbs , 12 short grbs _ with extended emission _ and 25 x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) ) with known redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> these indices are compared with the temporal decay index , @xmath2 , derived with the light curve fitting using the @xcite model . </S>",
    "<S> this model fitting yields similar distributions of @xmath2 to the fitted @xmath0 , but for individual bursts a difference can be significant . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of ( @xmath0 , @xmath3 ) distribution , where @xmath3 is the characteristic luminosity at the end of the plateau , reveals only a weak correlation of these quantities . </S>",
    "<S> however , we discovered a significant regular trend when studying grb @xmath0 values along the @xcite correlation between @xmath3 and the end time of the plateau emission in the rest frame , @xmath4 , hereafter lt correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we note a systematic variation of the @xmath0 parameter distribution with luminosity for any selected @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze this systematics with respect to the fitted lt correlation line , expecting that the presented trend may allow to constrain the grb physical models . </S>",
    "<S> we also attempted to use the derived correlation of @xmath5 versus @xmath6 to diminish the luminosity scatter related to the variations of @xmath0 along the lt distribution , a step forward in the effort of standardizing grbs . </S>",
    "<S> a proposed toy model accounting for this systematics applied to the analyzed grb distribution results in a slight increase of the lt correlation coefficient . </S>"
