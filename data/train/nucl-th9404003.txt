    "the recent studies of parity violation in compound nuclear states and the observation @xcite of large longitudinal asymmetries in the transmission of polarized epithermal neutrons has lead to a renewed interest in both the parity violating nuclear interaction and the relevant structure of the compound nucleus .",
    "a considerable number of theoretical papers was published on this subject in the last 3 - 4 years @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical effort was directed towards the understanding of the observed enhancements in the asymmetries and towards an understanding of sign correlations in these asymmetries detected in the studies with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the common basis of the majority of these theories was the use of a one - body parity non - conserving potential that induces parity mixing in the nucleus . in spite of this common basis the various works used different mathematical approaches and calculated a number of different terms that contribute to the parity violating asymmetries . in the present work ,",
    "starting from a one - body pv potential , we shall develop a consistent framework in which we attempt to calculate or estimate all the contributions emerging from such an approach .",
    "the recent theoretical work as well as the pioneering papers in this field @xcite deal with a new type of experiments that were first performed in the early eighties @xcite and then expanded in the in the early nineties mainly at the los alamos neutron scattering center ( lansce ) @xcite . in these experiments",
    "one observes resonance scattering to p - wave resonances .",
    "using polarized neutron beams and unpolarized medium and heavy mass targets one measures the longitudinal asymmetries : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the total cross sections for neutrons with positive and negative helicities respectively .",
    "a non zero value for @xmath4 indicates that parity is not conserved in the process .",
    "the large enhancements by factors @xmath5 predicted by theory were indeed observed in the original experiments about ten years ago @xcite as well as in the more recent ones @xcite .",
    "the great advantage of the recent improved los alamos experiments is that one is now able to measure parity violation of a number of @xmath6 resonances in the same nucleus .",
    "this enabled one to apply statistical arguments in order to determine the mean square pv matrix element and the _ average _ asymmetry @xmath4 .",
    "we should stress here that the excitation energies in the neutron plus target nucleus that are reached with ev neutrons are of the order of . in heavy nuclei",
    "this is the regime of the compound nucleus where the density of states is very large , the spacing between for example the states is of the order of .",
    "this means that the wave function of each such state contains about @xmath7 `` principal '' components , i.e.components that have comparable amplitudes each of the order @xmath8 .",
    "the components are defined as many - body shell - model configurations resulting from an appropriate single - particle basis .",
    "such large complexity of the compound nuclear states of course means that statistical arguments should apply .",
    "it is therefore quite a surprise that in the case of @xmath0 the sign of the asymmetry @xmath4 measured for all the nine states , that show statistically significant results , is positive .",
    "the average asymmetry for this nucleus was determined @xcite to be about @xmath9 .",
    "the resonances , both the @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are well separated , their width being of the order of a very small fraction of an ev , while as mentioned the separation is around 10 ev .",
    "most of these resonances were observed in the past in neutron scattering reactions .",
    "higher @xmath12 resonances ( @xmath13 etc . ) are not seen because of the low penetrabilities of such resonances . among the @xmath11-wave resonances that are observed , some have total spins of .",
    "these will not show up in the asymmetry measurements because parity violation in such resonances occurs through the mixing with the @xmath14 state and so the low penetrability will hinder the observation of any asymmetry signal",
    ".    in the approach taken in this paper , as well as in some other recent theoretical works we are able to incorporate aspects of relatively simple nuclear structure and dynamics as well as statistical behaviour . in the present work this duality will be quite explicit .",
    "in some cases we shall average over certain class of compound states while other states will be treated individually .",
    "the central quantity that is of interest in these parity violating studies is the asymmetry given in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . in all the experiments we discussed the asymmetry is measured on and off resonance .",
    "the on resonance measurements are for the to which we shall refer as the @xmath6 resonances .",
    "( it should be clear that in compound states the single particle @xmath6 component is very small of the order of @xmath16 admixture ) . for a @xmath6 resonance",
    "the asymmetry is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the helicity plus and minus on resonance total @xmath6 cross sections , and @xmath20 is the total helicity independent cross section for such resonance . in appendix [ app:1 ]",
    "we derive the relation between the asymmetry and the @xmath15-matrix . here",
    "we present this well known@xcite formula relating @xmath21 to the parity violating part of the @xmath15-matrix , @xmath22 : @xmath23",
    "we shall use the projection theory of feshbach @xcite and its extensions @xcite to formulate the reaction theory for the parity violating experiments in the compound nucleus . let us divide the complete space into the following subspaces relevant to our problem .",
    "the @xmath24 space ( the open channel space ) will contain the channels and , where @xmath25 is the ground state of the target , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the continuum single - particle states .",
    "the corresponding projection operator that projects onto this space will be denoted as @xmath4 ( not to be confused with @xmath21 the asymmetry in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath28 space will contain all bound states @xmath29 and the projection operator will be denoted as @xmath30 . in the @xmath31 space we shall keep the bound states @xmath32 and the corresponding projection operator will be denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "the rest of the existing states will not be of interest to us and therefore are not included in our considerations . as usual we shall assume that the spaces are mutually orthogonal , and that , , . a state of total spin",
    "is then written in terms of the above projection operators as : @xmath34 denoting by @xmath35 the full nuclear hamiltonian which contains both parity conserving and parity non - conserving parts , we can write the following set of coupled equations : @xmath36 where the usual notation @xmath37 stands for @xmath38 . we shall now eliminate the explicit reference to the @xmath39 part of the wave function by introducing the operator @xmath40 , given by : @xmath41 then we can write : @xmath42 the projection of the operator @xmath40 in eq .",

    "we should call the attention to the fact that following the experimental approach we attempt to calculate the various observables ( cross section , asymmetry ) for individual @xmath11-wave resonances only . the coupled equations ( [ 7 ] ) will give rise to rapidly fluctuating scattering amplitudes due to the @xmath28 space .",
    "the averaging over this space will be made at a later stage ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : doorway ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the case when the direct parity violating coupling _ between the channels _ is neglected .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation for @xmath49 ( subscript @xmath50 denotes @xmath11 or @xmath10 ) can be written : @xmath51 and more explicitly as : @xmath52 the @xmath15-matrix is : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the non - resonant part of the @xmath15-matrix due to @xmath43 . from now on we shall consider only the parity - violating part of the @xmath15-matrix : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the resonant part and @xmath58 is due to the parity - violating part of @xmath43 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the parity - violating @xmath61-matrix . unless we take channel coupling into account , @xmath62 has a definite parity and the parity - violating part of @xmath63 is zero . to shorten our notation we write : @xmath64    to first order in the parity violating interaction the second term in eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) gives two contributions .",
    "when @xmath65 is parity non - conserving we get the term : @xmath66 note that this term although resonant does not involve the mixing with @xmath29 states and therefore similarly to the case of isobaric analog resonances @xcite we will refer to it as the `` direct '' term .",

    "we have not included explicitly the above imaginary part .",
    "we consider now the case when there is direct parity violating coupling between the two channels that have opposite parity .",
    "we write equation in the form @xmath69 or @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are wave functions of @xmath6 and @xmath73 channels .",

    "this complexity is of course inherent in the physics of the compound nucleus , and usually statistical methods are adopted in order to calculate the observables @xcite .",
    "however , it was recognized in the past that due to the absence of strong multi - particle forces in the nuclear hamiltonian one can often reduce the complexity of the problem by introducing the notion of doorways @xcite .",

    "<S> in this work we formulate the reaction theory of parity violation in compound nuclear states using feshbach s projection operator formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we derive in this framework a complete set of terms that contribute to the longitudinal asymmetry measured in experiments with polarized epithermal neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the parity violating spreading width resulting from this formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the above formalism to derive expressions which hold in the case when the doorway state approximation is introduced . in applying the theory </S>",
    "<S> we limit ourselves in this work to the case when the parity violating ( pv ) potential and the strong interaction are one - body . in this approximation , using as the doorway the giant spin - dipole resonance and employing well known optical potentials and a time - reversal even , parity odd one - body interaction we calculate or estimate the terms we derived . among others , we evaluate numerically a new `` direct '' term and the channel coupling term first derived by lewenkopf and weidenmller , this in addition to the evaluation of the main `` compound '' term . in our calculations </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly orthogonalize the continuum and bound wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> we find the effects of orthogonalization to be very important . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is that the present one - body theory can not explain the average longitudinal asymmetry found in the recent polarized neutron experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm the discrepancy , first pointed out by auerbach and bowman , that emerges , between the calculated average asymmetry and the parity violating spreading width , when distant doorways are used in the theory . </S>"
