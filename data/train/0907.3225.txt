    "recently , a series of results ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) began to reveal the existence of a surprising connection between the world of perturbative expansions and renormalization procedures in quantum field theory and the theory of motives and periods of algebraic varieties .",
    "this lead to a growing interest in investigating algebro - geometric and motivic aspects of quantum field theory , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , for some recent developments .",
    "some of the main questions in the field revolve around the motivic nature of projective hypersurfaces associated to feynman graphs .",
    "it is known by a general result of @xcite that these hypersurfaces generate the grothendieck ring of varieties , which means that , for sufficiently complicated graphs , they can become arbitrarily complex as motives .",
    "however , one would like to identify explicit conditions on the feynman graphs that ensure that the numbers obtained by evalating the contribution of the corresponding feynman integral can be described in algebro geometric terms as periods of a sufficiently simple form , that is , periods of mixed tate motives .",
    "the reason to expect that this will be the case for significant classes of feynman graphs lies in extensive databases of calculations of such integrals ( see @xcite ) which reveal the pervasive appearance of multiple zeta values .    in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite we approached the question of understanding the motivic properties of the hypersurfaces of feynman graphs from the point of view of singularity theory .",
    "in fact , the graph hypersurfaces are typically highly singular , with singularity locus of low codimension . this has the effect that their motivic nature can often be simpler than what one would encounter in dealing with smooth hypersurfaces .",
    "this makes it possible to control the motivic complexity in terms of invariants that can measure effectively how singular the hypersurfaces are . to this purpose ,",
    "in @xcite we looked at algebro - geometric objects that behave like feynman rules in quantum field theory , in the sense that they have the right type of multiplicative behavior over disjoint unions of graphs and the right type of decomposition relating one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) graphs and more general connected graphs .",
    "the simplest example of such algebro - geometric feynman rules is the affine hypersurface complement associated to a feynman graph .",
    "this behaves like the expectation value of a quantum field theory whose edge propagator is the tate motive @xmath0 .",
    "another algebro - geometric feynman rule we constructed in @xcite is based on characteristic classes of singular varieties , assembled in the form of a polynomial @xmath1 $ ] associated to a feynman graph @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dependence of these algebro - geometric feynman rules on the underlying combinatorics of the graphs .",
    "our approach is based on deletion  contraction relations , that is , formulae relating the invariant of a graph to that of the graphs obtained by either deleting or contracting an edge .",
    "the results we present in this paper will , in particular , answer a question on deletion  contraction relations for feynman rules asked by michael falk to the first author during the jaca conference , which motivated us to consider this problem .",
    "it is well known that certain polynomial invariants of graphs , such as the tutte polynomial and various invariants obtained from it by specializations , satisfy deletion  contraction relations .",
    "these are akin to the skein relations for knot and link invariants , and make it possible to compute inductively the invariant for arbitrary graphs , by progressively reducing it to simpler graphs with fewer edges .",
    "we first show , in ",
    "[ feypolysec ] , that the tutte polynomial and its specializations , the tutte  grothendieck invariants , define abstract feynman rules in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we observe that this suggests possible modifications of these invariants based on applying a connes  kreimer style renormalization in terms of birkhoff factorization .",
    "this leads to modified invariants which may be worthy of consideration , although they lie beyond the purpose of this paper .",
    "having seen how the usual deletion  contraction relations of polynomial invariants of graphs fit in the language of feynman rules , we consider in  [ hypersurfsec ] our main object of interest , which is those abstract feynman rules that are of algebro - geometric and motivic nature , that is , that are defined in terms of the affine graph hypersurface complement and its class in the grothendieck ring of varieties , or its refinement introduced in @xcite , the ring of immersed conical varieties .",
    "we begin by showing that the polynomial invariant @xmath3 we constructed in @xcite in terms of characteristic classes is not a specialization of the tutte polynomial , hence it is likely to be a genuinely new type of graph polynomial which may behave in a more refined way in terms of deletion and contraction . to obtain an explicit deletion  contraction relation",
    ", we consider the universal motivic feynman rule defined by the class @xmath4 $ ] in the grothendieck ring of varieties of the complement of the affine graph hypersurface of a feynman graph .",
    "our first main result of the paper is theorem [ delcon ] where we show that @xmath5 satisfies a deletion  contraction relation of the form @xmath6 - \\bu(\\gamma\\smallsetminus e),\\ ] ] with @xmath7 the lefschetz motive . in  [ milnorsec ]",
    "we reinterpret this result in terms of linear systems and milnor fibers .",
    "this deletion  contraction formula pinpoints rather precisely the geometric mechanism by which non - mixed tate motives will start to appear when the complexity of the graph grows sufficiently .",
    "in fact , it is the motivic nature of the intersection of the hypersurfaces @xmath8 that becomes difficult to control , even when the motives of the two hypersurfaces separately are known to be mixed tate .",
    "we then investigate , in ",
    "[ opsec ] , certain simple operations on graphs , under which one can control explicitly the effect on the motivic feynman rule @xmath5 using the deletion  contraction relation .",
    "the first such example is the operation that replaces an edge in a given graph by @xmath9 parallel copies of the same edge .",
    "the effect on graph hypersurfaces and their classes @xmath5 of iterations of this operation can be packaged in the form of a generating series and a recursion , which is proved using the deletion  contraction relation .",
    "the main feature that makes it possible to control the whole recursive procedure in this case is a cancellation that eliminates the class involving the intersection of the hypersurfaces and expresses the result for arbitrary iterations as a function of just the classes @xmath5 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "our second main result in the paper is theorem [ paraledges ] , which identifies the recursion formula and the generating function for the motivic feynman rules under multiplication of edges in a graph .    as a comparison",
    ", we also compute explicitly in ",
    "[ multtuttesec ] the recusion formula satisfied by the tutte polynomial for this same family of operations on graphs given by multiplying edges .",
    "another example of operations on graphs for which the resulting @xmath5 can be controlled in terms of the deletion  contraction relations is obtained in  [ chainssec ] by looking at graphs that are chains of polygons .",
    "this case is further reduces in  [ lemonsec ] to the case of `` lemon graphs '' given by chains of triangles , for which an explicit recursion formula is computed .",
    "this then gives in  [ lemonadesec ] a similar recursion formula for the graphs obtained from a given graph by replacing a chosen edge by a lemon graph .",
    "we then show in  [ univsec ] that the recursion relations and generating functions for the motivic feynman rule and for the tutte polynomial under multiplication of edges in a graph are in fact closely related .",
    "we show that they are both specializations , for different choice of initial conditions , of the same universal recursion relation .",
    "we formulate a conjecture for a recursion relation for the polynomial invariant @xmath3 , based on numerical evidence collected by @xcite .",
    "it again consists of a specialization of the same universal recursion relation , for yet another choice of initial conditions .    in the last section",
    "we show that one can think of the motive of the hypersurface complement in the voevodsky triangulated category of mixed motives as a _",
    "categorification _ of the invariant @xmath5 , thinking of motives as a universal cohomology theory and of classes in the grothendieck ring as a universal euler characteristic .",
    "this categorification has properties similar to the well known categorifications of the jones polynomial via khovanov homology @xcite and of the chromatic polynomial and the tutte polynomial @xcite , @xcite via versions of graph cohomology .",
    "in fact , in all of these cases the deletion  contraction relations are expressed in the categorification in the form of a long exact cohomology sequence .",
    "we show that the same happens at the motivic level , in the form of a distinguished triangle in the triangulated category of mixed motives .",
    "we recall briefly how the feynman rules of a perturbative scalar field theory are defined , as a motivation for a more general notion of abstract feynman rule , which we then describe .",
    "the reader who does not wish to see the physical motivation can skip directly to the algebraic definition of abstract feynman rule given in definition [ abstrfeyrule ] , and use that as the starting point . since the main results of this paper concern certain abstract feynman rules of combinatorial , algebro - geometric , and motivic nature , the quantum field theoretic notions we recall here serve only as background and motivation .      in perturbative quantum field theory ,",
    "the evaluation of functional integrals computing expectation values of physical observables is obtained by expanding the integral in a perturbative series , whose terms are labeled by graphs , the feynman graphs of the theory , whose valences at vertices are determined by the lagrangian of the given physical theory . the number of loops of the feynman graphs determines how far one is going into the perturbative series in order to evaluate radiative corrections to the expectation value . the contribution of individual graphs to the perturbative series is determined by the _ feynman rules _ of the given quantum field theory . in the case of a scalar theory , these can be summarized as follows .    a graph @xmath2 is a feynman graph of the theory if all vertices have valence equal to the degree of one of the monomials in the lagrangian of the theory .",
    "feynman graphs have internal edges , which are thought of as matching pairs of half edges connecting two of the vertices of the graph , and external edges , which are unmatched half edges connected to a single vertex .",
    "a graph is 1-particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) if it can not be disconnected by removal of a single ( internal ) edge .",
    "we consider a scalar quantum field theory specified by a lagrangian of the form @xmath12 where we use euclidean signature in the metric on the underlying spacetime @xmath13 and the interaction term is a polynomial of the form @xmath14 in the following we will treat the dimension @xmath15 of the underlying spacetime as a variable parameter .    to a connected feynman graph of a given scalar quantum field theory one",
    "assigns a function @xmath16 of the external momenta in the following way .",
    "each internal edge @xmath17 contributes a momentum variable @xmath18 and the function of the external momenta is obtained by integrating a certain density function over the momentum variables of the internal edges , @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "we write @xmath21 for the collection of all the momentum variables assigned to the internal edges .",
    "the term @xmath22 is constructed according to the following procedure .",
    "each vertex @xmath23 contributes a factor of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the coupling constant of the monomial in the interaction term in the lagrangian of order equal to the valence of @xmath26 .",
    "one also imposes a conservation law on the momenta that flow through a vertex , @xmath27 written after chosing an orientation of the edges of the graph , so that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the source and target of an edge @xmath30 .",
    "when a vertex is attached to both internal and external edges , the conservation law at that vertex will be of an analogous form @xmath31 , involving both the @xmath32 variables of the momenta along internal edges and the @xmath33 variables of the external momenta .",
    "we will see later that the dependence on the choice of the orientation disappears in the final form of the feynman integral .",
    "each internal edge @xmath17 contributes an inverse propagator , that is , a term of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a quadratic form , which in the case of a scalar field in the euclidean signature is given by @xmath36    each external edge @xmath37 contributes an inverse propagator @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "the external momenta are assigned so that they satisfy the conservation law @xmath40 , when summed over the oriented external edges .",
    "the integrand @xmath22 is then a product @xmath41    the feynman rules defined in this way satisfy two main properties , which follow easily from the construction described above ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the feynman rules are multiplicative over disjoint unions of graphs ( hence one can reduce to considering only connected graphs ) : @xmath42 for a disjoint union @xmath43 , of two feynman graphs @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with external momenta @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "any connected graph @xmath2 can be obtained from a finite tree @xmath48 by replacing vertices @xmath26 of @xmath48 with 1pi graphs @xmath49 with number of external edges equal to the valence of the vertex @xmath26 .",
    "then the feynman rules satisfy @xmath50 the delta function in this expression matches the external momenta of the 1pi graphs inserted at vertices sharing a common edge .    up to a factor containing the inverse propagators of the external edges and the coupling constants of the vertices , we write @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the remaining term is @xmath54 where we have written the delta functions @xmath31 of equivalently in terms of the edge - vertex incidence matrix of the graph , @xmath55 when @xmath56 or @xmath57 and @xmath58 otherwise .",
    "the feynman integrals still satisfy the two properties and .",
    "notice that the property expressing the feynman rule for connected graphs in terms of feynman rules for 1pi graphs has a simpler form in the case where either all external momenta are set equal to zero and the theory is massive ( @xmath59 ) , or all external momenta are equal . in such cases reduces to a product @xmath60 with @xmath61 the inverse propagator assigned to a single edge .      in",
    "@xcite we abstracted the two properties of feynman rules recalled above and used them to define a class of _ algebro - geometric _ feynman rules .",
    "more precisely , we defined an abstract feynman rule in the following way .",
    "[ abstrfeyrule ] an abstract feynman rule is a map from the set of ( isomorphism classes of ) finite graphs to a commutative ring @xmath62 , with the property that it is multiplicative over disjoint unions of graphs , @xmath63 and such that , for a connected graph @xmath64 obtained by inserting 1pi graphs @xmath49 at the vertices of a tree @xmath48 , it satisfies @xmath65 where @xmath61 is the inverse propagator , that is , the value assigned to the graph consiting of a single edge .",
    "the multiplicative property with respect to disjoint unions of graphs , together with the second property which implies that 1pi graphs are sufficient to determine completely the feynmal rule , means that an abstract feynman rule with values in @xmath62 can be reformulated as a ring homomorphism from a hopf algebra @xmath66 of feynman graphs to @xmath62 . in this general",
    "setting , since we are not choosing a particular lagrangian of the theory , the hopf algebra is not the usual connes  kreimer hopf algebra @xcite , which depends on the lagrangian of a particular theory but the larger hopf algebra referred to in @xcite and @xcite as the `` core hopf algebra '' . as an algebra ( or a ring ) this is a polynomial algebra generated by all 1pi graphs and the coproduct is of the form @xmath67 where the sum is over subgraphs whose connected components are 1pi .",
    "the quotient @xmath68 is obtained by shrinking each component of @xmath69 to a single vertex .",
    "the hopf algebra is graded by loop number ( or by number of internal edges ) and the antipode is defined inductively by @xmath70 notice that the multiplicative property of feynman rules only relates to the algebra , not the coalgebra , structure of the hopf algebra of feynman graphs . where the coproduct and the antipode enter essentially is in the renormalization of abstract feynman rules , which can again be formulated purely algebraically in terms of a rota ",
    "baxter structure of weight @xmath71 on the target ring @xmath62 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we now show that the notion of abstract feynman rule is very natural .",
    "in fact , a broad range of classical combinatorial invariants of graphs define abstract feynman rules .      for a finite graph @xmath2 ,",
    "one denotes by @xmath72 the graph obtained by deleting an edge @xmath73 and by @xmath74 the graph obtained by contracting an edge @xmath75 to a vertex .",
    "they are called , respectively , the deletion and contraction of @xmath2 at @xmath30 .",
    "a class of invariants of graphs that behave well with respect to the operations of deletion and contraction are known as the tutte  grothendieck invariants @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the terminology comes from the tutte polynomial , which is the prototype example of such invariants , and from the formulation in terms of grothendieck rings of certain categories , as in @xcite .",

    "a looping edge is an edge that starts and ends at the same vertex .",
    "the relation is the deletion  contraction relation . by repeatedly applying it",
    "until one falls into one of the other case , this makes it possible to completely determine the value of a tutte  grothendieck invariant for all graphs .",

    "the closed formula is given by the `` sum over states '' formula @xmath87 where the sum is over subgraphs @xmath88 with vertex set @xmath89 and edge set @xmath90 .",
    "this can be written equivalently as @xmath91 an equivalent way to express the recursive relations computing the tutte polynomials is the following :    * if @xmath75 is neither a looping edge nor a bridge the deletion  contraction relation holds . *",

    "in fact , the multiplicative property follows from the same property for the tutte polynomial and the specialization formula .",

    "a deletion / contraction rule for the invariant @xmath626 is not yet available ; however , if such a rule exists then a doubling - edge formula for this invariant should exist , of the type considered above : if @xmath30 is an edge of @xmath2 joining the marked vertices , then one would expect @xmath627 for suitable coefficients satisfying the stringent requirements examined in   [ genrecu ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath626 is known for banana graphs ( example  3.8 in @xcite ) provides then a testing ground for this phenomenon , as well as a precise indication for what the needed representation should be in this case .",

    "various examples of categorifications of graph and link invariants have been recently developed .",
    "these are categorical constructions with associated ( co)homology theories , from which the ( polynomial ) invariant is recontructed as euler characteristic .",
    "the most famous examples of categorification are khovanov homology @xcite , which is a categorification of the jones polynomial , and graph homology , which gives a categorification of the chromatic polynomial @xcite .",
    "more recently , a categorification of the tutte polynomial was also introduced in @xcite . in the known categorifications of invariants obtained from specializations of the tutte polynomial , the deletion  contraction relations",
    "manifest themselves in the form of long exact ( co)homology sequences .",
    "another way in which the notion of categorification found applications to algebraic structures associated to graphs is in the context of hall algebras . in this context ,",

    "this requires expressing @xmath656 in terms of mixed tate motives .",

    "another possible way of formulation the deletion  contraction relations of theorem [ delcon ] at the level of the triangulated category of mixed motives , in the form of distinguished triangles , would be to use the geometric description of the deletion  contraction relations given in  [ milnorsec ] in terms of the blowup diagram and used distinguished triangles in @xmath635 associated to blowups .",
