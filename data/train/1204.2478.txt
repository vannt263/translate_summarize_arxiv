    "at experimentally attainable energy scales , einstein s special relativity ( sr ) is compatible with the present observations .",
    "however , the sr is believed to be modified at higher energy scales , such as the planck scale which involves the effects of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the study on the string theory reveals that the lorentz symmetry could be broken spontaneously in the perturbative framework @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous lorentz invariance violation ( sliv ) involves nonzero vacuum expectation values of certain tensor fields .",
    "it characterizes the anisotropy of spacetime since nonzero vacuum expectations of tensor fields are related to certain preferred directions .    to demonstrate spirit of the sliv , we review shortly the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electroweak theory .",
    "the electroweak theory involves a higgs field acquiring a nonzero vacuum expectation value , which leads to the mass terms of other particles .",
    "similarly , certain tensor fields acquire nonzero vacuum expectation values in the sliv framework . however , these expectation values take along the spacetime indices , which are different from the scalar one in the standard model ( sm ) . therefore , the velocities of particles and fields may influence propagations and interactions , respectively .",
    "actually , the sliv terms are added into the lagrangian of fields by considering the gauge invariance , renormalizability , etc .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of tensor fields become the coupling constants in the sliv terms .",
    "this approach to introduce the sliv effects is called the standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite , which is an effective field theory irrelative to the ultimately underlying theory .",
    "obviously , the spacetime background is still minkowskian in the sme .",
    "however , minkowski spacetime should be amended together with lagrangian of particles and fields if the lorentz symmetry is violated ( no matter spontaneously or not ) .",
    "recently , kostelecky @xcite proposed that the sme is closely related to finsler spacetime which is intrinsically anisotropic .",
    "the coupling constants in the sliv terms could be related to certain fixed preferred directions in the finsler structure .",
    "the most fundamental reason is that finsler geometry @xcite gets rid of the quadratic restriction on the spacetime structure such that the finsler metric depends on directions of the spacetime .",
    "in addition , the isometric transformations reveal that non ",
    "riemannian finsler spacetime possesses fewer symmetries than riemann spacetime @xcite .",
    "these characters imply that finsler spacetime is intrinsically anisotropic .",
    "einstein s special relativity resides in a flat riemann spacetime , namely minkowski spacetime .",
    "similarly , the special relativity with liv effects may reside in a flat finsler spacetime .",
    "in fact , it is found that the sme  related finsler spacetime is indeed flat in the sense of finsler geometry @xcite .",
    "for instance , the simplest sme model , with only one nonvanishing coupling constant @xmath0 in the sliv terms , leads to a flat spacetime of randers  finsler geometry @xcite . actually , the flat finsler spacetime is called locally minkowski spacetime @xcite , which could be viewed as a generalization of minkowski spacetime .",
    "in addition , doubly special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite was found to be incorporated into finsler spacetime @xcite , as well as very special relativity ( vsr ) @xcite .",
    "as the liv corresponds to new spacetime , it is valuable to investigate physics compatible with the liv effects . in this paper",
    ", we try to set up equations of motion for the electromagnetic field in locally minkowski spacetime .",
    "a lagrangian is proposed for the electromagnetic field in such a spacetime .",
    "the liv effects are induced into the lagrangian in a natural way .",
    "the amended maxwell equations are obtained via the variation of action .",
    "a formal plane wave solution is obtained for the electromagnetic wave .",
    "the dispersion relation is modified for the electromagnetic wave .",
    "we also study the electromagnetic field at the first order of liv effects .",
    "we compare these perturbative results with those in the sme framework .",
    "relations and differences are discussed between finsler spacetime and the sme .",
    "an interpretation is proposed for the liv effects as influence of an anisotropic media .",
    "in addition , a constraint on the spacetime anisotropy could be obtained from astrophysical observations on gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly discuss the spacetime in finsler spacetime , especially the locally minkowski spacetime .",
    "we propose an electromagnetic field model in locally minkowksi spacetime in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we study this model at the first order of liv effects and compare it with the sme .",
    "the anisotropic media is invoked to interpret the liv effects on the electromagnetic field . in section 5",
    ", a constraint on the liv effects is obtained from the _ fermi_observations of grbs in a specific locally minkowski metric .",
    "conclusions and remarks are listed in section 6 .",
    "finsler spacetime is defined on the tangent bundle @xmath1 instead of the manifold @xmath2 .",
    "each element of @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "finsler geometry originates from the integral of the form @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes a position and @xmath9 denotes a so  called 4velocity .",
    "the integrand @xmath10 is called a finsler structure , which is a smooth , positive and positively 1homogeneous function defined on the slit tangent bundle @xmath11 .",
    "the positive 1homogeneity denotes the character @xmath12 for all @xmath13 .",
    "the finsler metric is defined as @xmath14 together with its inverse tensor , it is used for raising and lowering indices of tensors . note that the finsler metric becomes riemannian if it does not depend on @xmath15 .",
    "a finsler spacetime ( @xmath2,@xmath16 ) is called locally minkowski spacetime @xcite if there is no dependence on @xmath8 for finsler structure @xmath16 , namely @xmath17 . therefore , the finsler metric @xmath18 only depends on @xmath15 according to ( [ finsler metric ] ) . in such a spacetime ,",
    "connections and curvatures vanish .",
    "therefore , it is flat and maximally symmetric @xcite .",
    "the vanishment of the connections implies that a free particle follows a straight line .",
    "it also implies that locally minkowski spacetime belongs to berwald spacetime @xcite .",
    "all tangent spaces of berwald spacetime are linearly isomorphic to one common minkowski  normed linear space .",
    "physically , this character implies that the laws of physics are common at each position in such a spacetime .    in finsler spacetime , 4velocity of a free particle",
    "is given by the finsler geodesic equation @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the connection .",
    "the finsler geodesic originates from variation of an integral of the finsler line element of the form ( [ finsler geometry ] ) . in locally minkowski spacetime ,",
    "the connections vanish , particularly .",
    "the finsler geodesic equation ( [ geodesic ] ) becomes @xmath21 its solution gives a constant vector to @xmath15 , which means that @xmath15 is independent on @xmath8 . in this paper , @xmath15 denotes 4velocity of a free photon along the finsler geodesic . for a charged particle , such as electron",
    ", it would interact with the electromagnetic field .",
    "the finsler geodesic equation should be modified .",
    "an extra term related to electromagnetic force @xmath22 should be added to the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of the finsler geodesic equation .",
    "the velocity of the charged particle is given by the solution of the modified geodesic equation .",
    "thus , it depends on @xmath8 .",
    "an advantage of studying the liv in finsler spacetime is that the principle of relativity is preserved automatically . as in minkowski spacetime",
    ", we define the 4potential 1form of electromagnetic field in locally minkowski spacetime @xmath23 it preserves the internal u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "the electromagnetic 4potential is chosen as such a form that its 2form excludes the terms @xmath24 and @xmath25 whose physical meaning is unclear .",
    "therefore , the field strength 2form is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is invariant under the u(1 ) gauge group .",
    "one of the maxwell equations is given by the bianchi identity @xmath28 , @xmath29 it is similar to the one in minkowski spacetime .",
    "in addition , the contravariant field strength @xmath30 is given via raising the indices of the covariant 2form ( [ 2form ] ) by the finsler metric @xmath31 of locally minkowski spacetime , namely @xmath32 . in this way",
    ", the covariant character is preserved in locally mikowski spacetime .",
    "we follow the form of the lagrangian for the electromagnetic field but replace the spacetime metric @xmath33 by the finsler metric @xmath34 @xcite . in this way",
    ", the lagrangian could reduce back to the one in minkowski spacetime when locally minkowski spacetime reduces into minkowski spacetime .",
    "the lagrangian takes the form @xmath35 the liv effects are introduced via contracting the spacetime indices by the finsler metric .",
    "the lagrangian is invariant under coordinate transformations .    in locally minkowski spacetime ,",
    "an orthogonal base is given by @xmath36 and its dual base is @xmath37 .",
    "the action of the electromagnetic field could be given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the invariant volume element at each position @xmath8 .",

    "it has a formal plane wave solution @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes a polarization and @xmath49 denotes a wavevector of the electromagnetic plane wave . by substituting ( [ plane wave solution ] ) into ( [ electromagnetic wave equation ] ) , we obtain a dispersion relation for the electromagnetic plane wave @xmath50 its form is as similar as the one in the lorentz invariant electrodynamics .",
    "however , it is modified by the finsler metric @xmath18 since the contraction of spacetime indices is implicated via this metric .",
    "observations do not show signals of the liv effects at the present attainable energy scales @xcite .",

    ", the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) of the electromagnetic field could be expanded into @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the lorentz invariant term while the liv term is given as @xmath55 in the above equation , we have anti  symmetrized the indices @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in the sme framework , meanwhile , the cpt  even sliv term in the lagrangian of the electromagnetic field is given by @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes a dimensionless parameter which characterizes the level of the sliv effects . in the sme , the parameter @xmath59 is given by hand .    in locally minkowski spacetime , however , we could relate this parameter to deformation parameter @xmath60 of the spacetime from minkowski to locally minkowski . by comparing ( [ sliv in locally minkowski spacetime ] ) and",
    "( [ sliv in sme ] ) , we obtain a relation @xmath61 in the sme , the parameter @xmath62 is a constant since the energy and momentum are conserved @xcite . in locally minkowski spacetime , the geodesic equation ( [ geodesic equation ] ) of photon gives @xmath15 a constant vector along the geodesic .",
    "thus , @xmath63 is a constant and the r.h.s . of equation ( [ sme_finsler ] ) is also a constant .",
    "these inferences mean that the liv electromagnetic field model obtained in locally minkowski spacetime is compatible with the perturbative results in the sme . in addition , there are ten independent components for @xmath60 while nineteen for @xmath64 @xcite",
    ". only components of the form @xmath65 are possibly nonvanishing in locally minkowski spacetime .",
    "furthermore , the birefringence of light will not emerge at the leading order in this finsler model of electromagnetic field .",
    "the reason is that all weyl components of @xmath64 vanish at the leading order @xcite .",
    "these predictions distinguish the electromagnetic field model in locally minkowski spacetime from the sme ",
    "based one .    as @xmath66 does in the sme",
    ", the liv term @xmath67 also denotes the lorentz  violating interactions at first order for the electromagnetic field in locally minkowski spacetime . traditionally , the observations on the electromagnetic field give rise to the most stringent tests of the lorentz symmetry .",
    "an incomplete list includes : the liv could lead to the anisotropy of the speed of light which is tested by the michelson ",
    "morley experiment @xcite ; there is an atomic clock experiment named as the hughes  drever experiment @xcite which is used to test the variation of the sme coefficients with the movement of the earth ; the observations from distant galaxies give severe limits on the birefringence of light @xcite , and etc . for a more detailed summarization on the observations of the ( s)liv effects , see for example citations @xcite and references therein .",
    "the maxwell equations ( [ fisrt maxwell s equation ] ) and ( [ second maxwell s equation ] ) could be rewritten as @xmath68 the second equation includes the liv effects while the first one is not related to dynamics .",
    "the electromagnetic wave equation ( [ electromagnetic wave equation ] ) could be expanded as @xmath69 where the first term denotes the electromagnetic wave equation in minkowski spacetime and the second term denotes the terms related to the liv effects .",
    "there is a solution for this wave equation ( [ electromagnetic wave in series ] ) at first order @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the zero  order solution and the first  order solution , respectively . the zero  order solution @xmath71 satisfies the electromagnetic wave equation in minkowski spacetime , namely @xmath73 it has a plane wave solution @xmath74",
    "therefore , we could obtain an equation for the first ",
    "order solution @xmath72 as @xmath75 where we have contracted indices with @xmath76 in the third equal . the r.h.s . of the above equation behaves like a source of the electromagnetic field , which could be viewed as influence from a slightly anisotropic media on the electromagnetic wave",
    ". furthermore , the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion relation of light ] ) could be expanded into @xmath77 it is also called the lightcone . the lightcone is enlarged if the r.h.s . of",
    "the above equation is negative , while narrowed if the r.h.s . of the above equation",
    "is positive .",
    "it depends on concrete characters of the liv effects @xmath52",
    ". the spatial speed of light could be superluminal if the lightcone is enlarged while it is subluminal if the lightcone is narrowed , and vice versa @xcite .",
    "in addition , the speed of light could depend on its direction since there could be of direction  dependence for @xmath52 .",
    "these could be tested by observations , such as the michelson ",
    "morley experiment .",
    "in this section , a specific locally minkowksi metric is postulated and investigated .",
    "the speed of light is obtained to be subluminal and the lightcone is found to be squeezed .",
    "in addition , a constraint on the level of the liv effects is gained from the _ fermi_observations of grbs .    to discuss detailed predictions on the liv effects",
    ", we postulate the locally minkowski spacetime as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is assumed and @xmath80 is positive .",
    "@xmath16 has been normalized @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the 4velocity of a particle is related to 4momentum of this particle .",
    "thus , @xmath15 could be characterized by @xmath62 . in the simplest case , @xmath15 is a linear function of @xmath62 , namely @xmath83 as similar as that in quantum mechanics . in this way , the metric could be written as @xmath84 where the constant @xmath2 is a high  energy scale into which @xmath80 has been absorbed .",
    "the perturbative metric deviation is given by @xmath85 and other components vanish .",
    "the energy scale @xmath2 implies a scale for possible occurrence of the liv effects .",
    "meanwhile , it reveals that the liv effects are suppressed severely by this scale .",
    "therefore , the liv effects are expected to be most possibly observed in the ultra  high energy physics , such as the planck scale .    with the spatially isotropic metric ( [ specific locally minkowski metric ] ) , the electromagnetic wave equation ( [ electromagnetic wave equation ] ) ( or ( [ electromagnetic wave in series ] ) ) becomes @xmath86a_{\\sigma}=0\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath87 denotes the 3d divergence . comparing this equation with that in the lorentz ",
    "invariant electrodynamics , we obtain the speed of light as @xmath88 it implies that a photon with energy @xmath89 would propagate subluminally in such a spacetime",
    ". meanwhile , higher the photon energy is , slower it propagates . on the other hand , the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion relation of light ] ) ( or ( [ dispersion relation in series ] ) ) becomes @xmath90 it implies that the lightcone is squeezed .",
    "higher the photon energy is , more severely its lightcone is squeezed .",
    "these are consistent with the prediction that the speed of light ( [ speed of light ] ) is `` subluminal '' .",
    "the above predictions could be tested by the astrophysical observations on grbs .",
    "the reason is that the above liv effects could be accumulated after photons traveling a cosmological distance .",
