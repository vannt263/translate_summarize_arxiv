    "the latter turns out to be _ dependent _ on how @xmath17 is smoothed out or cut - off around @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , in order to avoid the landau pole .",
    "however if @xmath20 , it is suppressed by a power of @xmath21 .",
    "perturbative calculations are thus hampered by two @xmath16-singularities .",
    "the first one , the hard pomeron @xmath22 is a singularity of the _ anomalous dimension expansion _",
    ", not necessarily of the full amplitude , and is our main concern here .",
    "it dominates an intermediate-@xmath2 regime , characterized by quite large anomalous dimensions . the second singularity ",
    "the pomeron @xmath23  is the leading @xmath16-singularity of the amplitude and dominates the very small-@xmath2 regime , but is non - perturbative and is not directly related to scaling violations .",
    "the treatment of the hard pomeron just summarized has , however , the limitation that @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ defg ] ) is kept frozen in front of @xmath25 , while the overall factor @xmath17 is allowed to run .",
    "even if consistent at nl level , this approach should be improved in order to perform partial resummations to all orders in @xmath17 , as we envisage here .",
    "how can this be achieved ?",
    "our main proposal is to use @xmath16 as the expansion parameter of the bfkl solutions , instead of @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , we look for the ( regular ) solution @xcite of the homogeneous bfkl equation @xmath26(t)\\quad,\\label{eqbfkl}\\ ] ] where the kernel @xmath27 has a general @xmath17-dependence of the form ( see sec .",
    "( [ intle ] ) ) @xmath28 and the @xmath29 are scale invariant kernels which may be @xmath16-dependent .",
    "we then assume the ansatz @xmath30 where @xmath31 is to be found by solving eq .",
    "( [ eqbfkl ] ) , as a power series in @xmath16 .",
    "the relevance of such solution is that it is shown to represent @xcite the asymptotic form of the green s function ( [ defg ] ) for a general form of the kernel @xmath32 , as follows @xmath33 where , for a given regularization of the landau pole , @xmath34 has the form ( [ rappf ] ) , while @xmath35 contains the ( regularization - dependent ) pomeron singularity .    while the detailed properties of @xmath31 are dependent on how @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ nucleo ] ) is smoothed out or cut - off around @xmath18 , the large-@xmath12 behaviour of eq .",
    "( [ rappf ] ) is instead universal , provided a saddle point @xmath36 of the exponent @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ rappf ] ) exists and is stable .",
    "we thus assume , in the asymptotic regime @xmath38 , the expansion @xmath39 with the saddle point conditions @xmath40 which need to be checked `` a posteriori '' .    the crucial property of the representation ( [ rappf ] ) around the saddle point of eqs .",
    "( [ espans ] ) and ( [ cond ] ) is that it takes a form consistent with the r.g .",
    ", namely @xmath41 where , for any @xmath16-dependence , @xmath42 so that eq .",
    "( [ fattg ] ) takes the form anticipated in eq .",
    "( [ gasint ] ) for the gluon green s function .",
    "furthermore , the form of @xmath43 can be found , as an expansion in @xmath16 , from the original equation ( [ eqbfkl ] ) , expanded around the saddle point .",
    "for instance , if we let the coupling run up to nl level , by expanding the eigenvalue functions @xmath44 of @xmath45 up to the relevant order in @xmath46 , we find the solution @xmath47 which has been pushed up to nnl level in @xmath16 .",
    "some of the terms of the @xmath16-expansion ( [ svilchi ] ) follow from the trivial replacement @xmath48 , while the term @xmath49 needs a careful treatment of fluctuations .",
    "this result is confirmed , and extended to higher orders , by the replacement @xmath50 in the bfkl equation , which leads to a non linear differential equation for @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the result ( [ svilchi ] ) is the basic formula that we present here , in order to resum some large subleading corrections , and to obtain a smoother nl truncation for the remaining ones .",
    "basically , the coefficients of the @xmath16-expansion ( [ svilchi ] ) turn out to be less singular than the ones in the @xmath52-expansion in the collinear limits @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , related to @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is due to the powers of @xmath57 in the denominators which damp the collinear behaviour and to cancellations to be explained below .",
    "this feature will yield a smoother expansion in the region @xmath58 also , which is the relevant one for the hard pomeron estimate .",

    "the running coupling terms are proportional to the one - loop beta function coefficient @xmath69 and refer to the choice of eq .",
    "( [ nucleo ] ) of factorizing the running coupling @xmath17 at the upper scale @xmath70 of the kernel @xmath71 , instead of a symmetrical combination of @xmath4 and @xmath72 .",
    "their explicit form can be shown @xcite to shift the effective scale to the symmetrical one @xmath73 , which is the one occurring in the phase space @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the longitudinal part of the two - gluon subenergy in the @xmath76-channel . in @xmath77-space ,",
    "the running coupling terms show a double pole at @xmath78 only .",
    "the collinear and scale - dependent terms have multiple poles at both @xmath79 and @xmath78 due to the behaviour of the kernel for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "all these poles are actually of collinear origin , and the cubic ones are dependent on the choice of the scale of the energy in eq .",
    "( [ sezurto ] ) , whether it is @xmath82 ( the symmetrical choice ) , or instead @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) , which is the choice leading to the correct scaling variable @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) for @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "it has been already remarked @xcite that the choice @xmath82 is not collinear safe and leads to the nasty singularities of type @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) of @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ chiu ] ) , which correspond to the double logarithmic behaviour @xmath91 of the kernel when @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "on the other hand , complete information about the collinear behaviour of the kernel in such regions comes from the renormalization group equations . in general the kernel @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ nucleo ] ) is collinear finite and symmetrical in its arguments for @xmath82 , so that it must have the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 can be expanded in @xmath17 with scale - invariant coefficients , as assumed in eq .",
    "( [ nucleo ] ) .",
    "furthermore , calling @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) the kernel at energy scale @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) , it acquires for @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) the collinear singularities due to the non singular part of the gluon anomalous dimension in the @xmath101-scheme @xcite which , neglecting the @xmath59 part , is @xmath102 the singular part being taken into account by the bfkl iteration itself .",
    "it follows that , for @xmath80 , @xmath103 with a similar behaviour , with @xmath12 and @xmath104 interchanged , for @xmath96 in the opposite limit @xmath81 .    in order to derive from eq .",
    "( [ kuno ] ) the @xmath77-dependent singularities of @xmath27 care should be taken of the relationships @xcite @xmath105 which shift the @xmath77-singularities of @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) by @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) . as a consequence , by eq .",

    "( [ nucleo ] ) are @xmath110 in particular , @xmath111 has symmetrical singularities and @xmath112 slightly asymmetrical ones , as follows : @xmath113    the shift by @xmath114 in eqs .",
    "( [ chin])-([chiusv ] ) already represents a resummation of the scale - dependent singularities , as noticed by salam @xcite , and it provides the correct scale - dependent terms ( @xmath115 ) by the @xmath16-expansion of eq .",
    "( [ chiosv ] ) . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ chiusv ] ) provides the correct collinear behaviour of @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) close to @xmath79 ( @xmath78 ) at nl order , and eq .",
    "( [ chin ] ) generalizes it to all orders .    the simplest realization of eq .",
    "( [ chiosv ] ) is to assume , following ref .",
    "@xcite , that @xmath116 in eqs .",
    "( [ nucleo ] ) and ( [ svilchi ] ) is provided by the eigenvalue function of the lund model @xcite @xmath117 which corresponds to the kernel @xmath118 here the @xmath16-dependent factor @xmath119 can be directly interpreted as an @xmath76-channel threshold factor @xcite in properly defined toller variables @xcite .",
    "the nl terms in eq .",
    "( [ svilchi ] ) are now simply identified from eq .",
    "( [ chiu ] ) after subtraction of the singular part of the scale - dependent terms already taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ lund ] ) .",
    "this subtraction eliminates the cubic singularities in @xmath63 , but leaves double and single poles which need to be shifted by the procedure of ref .",
    "this amounts to the replacement of @xmath63 by @xmath120 where now @xmath121 has no @xmath79 nor @xmath78 singularities at all .    what about higher subleading orders in eq .",
    "( [ svilchi ] ) ? here",
    "the crucial observation is that , after substitution of the behaviour ( [ chin ] ) in the nnl term of eq .",
    "( [ svilchi ] ) , the leading @xmath77-singularities _ cancel out close to both @xmath79 and _ @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the coefficient of @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ svilchi ] ) has _ no @xmath77-singularities _ at all , and no further resummation is needed .",
    "this peculiar feature , confirmed at higher orders @xcite , is due to the fact that running coupling effects are already taken into account by the representation ( [ rappf ] ) with the solution ( [ svilchi ] ) .        then reads @xmath123 and contains only the shifted single poles in @xmath77 , while the neglected terms have no leading twist @xmath77-singularities .",
    "this expression performs the resummation of the scale - dependent singularities proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it also takes into account the collinear singularities of eq .",
    "( [ chin ] ) to all orders .",
    "this resummation effect is perhaps more easily seen by using eq .",

    "( [ cond ] ) in the form @xmath124^{-1}\\quad,\\label{bot}\\ ] ] which defines an effective @xmath51-function as a power series in @xmath52 . by specializing eq .",
    "( [ bot ] ) to the scale @xmath70 ( shift @xmath125 ) , it is apparent that all the small @xmath77 poles @xmath126 are resummed as a geometric series , to provide the full one - loop anomalous dimension of eq .",
    "( [ dimanom ] ) .",
    "the expression ( [ chieff ] ) for @xmath43 is not fully symmetrical under the replacement @xmath127 , but keeps the asymmetrical @xmath128 contribution of eq .",
    "( [ chiu ] ) .",
    "the breakdown of the @xmath127 symmetry in eq .",
    "( [ rappf ] ) follows from that of scale invariance by running coupling effects .",
    "it is easy to recognize that the contribution @xmath128 to @xmath43 yields a factor @xmath129 in the representation ( [ rappf ] ) , and this factor _ is required _",
    "@xcite by the continuum normalization of the eigenfunctions of @xmath27 provided by the jacobian @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , even if the kernel @xmath27 and the green s function @xmath131 are symmetrical operators , the effective eigenvalue function @xmath43 must have some asymmetry , due to running coupling effects .",
    "it appears from fig .",
    "( [ figchi ] ) that @xmath43 , with the @xmath69-dependent asymmetry pointed out before , is a decreasing function of @xmath16 because of the negative sign of nl corrections , and contains a stable minimum for all the relevant @xmath16 values .",
    "this means that in the present approach the hard pomeron can be estimated up to sizeable values of @xmath132 , and it turns out to be @xmath133 in this range , which is a reasonable value for the hera data @xcite at intermediate values or @xmath134 .",

    "( [ chieff ] ) the neglected terms  of order @xmath122 or higher  have no @xmath77-singularities , they only affect the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) by a roughly @xmath77-independent uncertainty which corresponds to a change of scale @xmath135 , or @xmath136 .",
    "this means that the error affecting the nl truncation is uniformly of nnl order for all values of @xmath77  whether @xmath137 , @xmath138 or @xmath139  and therefore it can not change too much the @xmath23-estimate given above .",
