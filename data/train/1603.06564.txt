    "this work completes the study of percolation on random recursive trees initiated in  @xcite , where percolation with supercritical parameter @xmath559 , @xmath10 fixed , is studied . in",
    "@xcite , non - gaussian fluctuations of the root cluster were proved , and the analysis of percolation clusters was extended in  @xcite to all regimes @xmath39 .",

    "some results can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite , although the motivation there is somehow different . for similar reasons , we term the regime @xmath7 considered here `` subcritical '' .",
    "the classification into different regimes draws on the terminology which is usually used to describe the erds - rnyi random graph model ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we stress that there are other natural families of trees which can be grown according to a probabilistic evolution algorithm , like , e.g. , scale - free random trees or @xmath569-ary random increasing trees .",
