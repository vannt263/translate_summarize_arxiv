    "for a randomly selected mathematician outside of the field of general topology  or , to be more precise , ` general topological algebra '  the words ` topological group ' most probably sound synonymous with ` locally compact group . '",
    "indeed , the depth , beauty and importance of theory of locally compact groups , in particular representation theory , abstract harmonic analysis , duality theory and structure theory , are overwhelming , while the richness of links with other areas of mathematics , physics , chemistry , computing and other sciences is hard to match . a natural question to ask is therefore : + @xmath0 _ is there life beyond local compactness ? _ + in the present audience the question sounds hollow rhetoric as the answer is known to be in the affirmative to just about everyone .",
    "therefore , i will sharpen it up : + @xmath0 _ does there exist a potential for a theory of ( some classes of ) non - locally compact groups of a comparable depth to that of theory of locally compact groups ? _ + the answer to this question is much less obvious , as probably only very few people would rush into betting on a definite ` yes ' or ` no . '",
    "there is a not uncommonly held opinion ( which some of us would dispute ) that the most recent result in the theory of topological groups that really mattered for the rest of mathematics was the solution to hilbert s fifth problem @xcite ; can we presently discern where the next result about topological groups to have an equally resounding impact could emerge from ? as a matter of fact , every professional working in the field is guided by a vision of his / her own , and the totality of views coming from different researchers would span a remarkably diverse range of opinions .",
    "this paper offers such an opinion belonging to the present author .",
    "accordingly , the article does not attempt to be in any way comprehensive and compete with such substantial surveys on topological groups as @xcite , or else @xcite .    one obvious approach to exploring the general question stated above is to try and directly extend concepts and results from the locally compact case to more general classes of groups . in this way",
    ", one surrounds the class of locally compact groups with a larger ` halo ' formed by topological groups that inherit some or other features of locally compact groups .",
    "one of such species of topological groups thriving in the penumbral shadows of local compactness is the class of nuclear ( abelian ) groups advertised by banaszczyk @xcite , whose _",
    "raison dtre _ is essentially testing the limits of pontryagin  van kampen duality , as well as of the entire body of closely related structural results such as glicksberg s theorem @xcite .",
    "another such species is the class of pseudocompact groups which is very popular nowadays largely due to the consistent efforts of wis comfort over the past few decades @xcite .",
    "there can hardly be a better recipe for achieving a deeper insight into the nature of ( locally ) compact groups than walking a few steps away and having a good look from the outside ! as a matter of fact , this approach can lead to fruitful insights into the structure and properties of topological groups of very general nature .",
    "one would expect essential further progress achieved in this direction in the future .",
    "nevertheless , one meets certain limitations on this way , since most of tools making the theory of lc groups a success are intrinsic to local compactness  like the left - invariant locally finite finitely additive borel measure , positive on non - void open sets @xcite .",
    "this makes an alternative approach unavoidable : to isolate new classes of topological groups of importance on their own right with a view towards understanding their structure and properties .",
    "such large ( ` esentially non - locally compact ' ) topological groups originate in many different contexts : in set - theoretic and smooth topology , ergodic theory , representation theory , functional analysis , and topological dynamics , to name a few . below",
    "we will exhibit examples of such groups and show that some of their properties have no analogue in the locally compact case .",
    "the paper is loosely ` coordinatized ' by the following four notions .    _",
    "1 . embeddings .",
    "_    the following question has stimulated investigations in the theory of topological groups over many years .",
    "let @xmath1 be a non - empty class of topological groups ( possibly consisting just of a single group ) .",
    "when is a given topological group @xmath2 isomorphic to a subgroup of a group from @xmath1 ?",
    "actions . _    the situation where a topological group @xmath2 acts continuously on a topological space @xmath3 emerges very often in disparate contexts throughout mathematics . if @xmath3 is compact , then the triple formed by @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and the action of @xmath2 on @xmath3 forms , formally speaking , the object of study of abstract topological dynamics .",
    "however , the accents in topological dynamics are put on different concepts  having more to do with the structure and properties of orbits  from those we are interested in .",
    "our emphasis will be also different from theory of @xmath2-spaces , where the main attention is paid to the phase space @xmath3 .",
    "we prefer to talk simply of actions .    \\3 . _ ` massive , ' or ` large , ' groups . _",
    "it is impossible to give a formal definition of this concept , yet ` large ' groups are easy to recognize .",
    "examples include the group of all self - homeomorphisms of a ( sufficiently homogeneous ) compact or locally compact space equipped with the compact - open topology ( or related topologies ) , the full unitary group of an infinite - dimensional hilbert space , typically with the strong operator topology , the group of measure - preserving transformations of a lebesgue measure space with the weak topology , and so forth .",
    "the role played by such groups in mathematics is fundamental , yet there is no coherent unifying theory in existence for the time being .",
    "_ free topological groups . _    free topological groups , introduced by markov in 1941 along with their closest counterparts such as free abelian topological groups and free locally convex spaces , served as an inspiration for the concept of a universal arrow to a functor introduced by pierre samuel",
    "free topological groups remain a very useful source of examples and building blocks in general topological group theory . apart from that",
    ", these objects have never enjoyed much popularity and are often perceived as exotic . however , such objects , properly disguised , often resurface in other areas of mathematics , meaning that the accumulated expertise of topological group theorists is very probably applicable to problems that at the first sight have nothing to do with topological algebra .",
    "each of the above four concepts will feature below in three different roles : as a tool , as an object of study , and as a link between ` general topological algebra ' and other disciplines of mathematics .",
    "notice that all of the above are closely intertwined and their role in our presentation is that of a coordinate system rather than a linear index .",
    "it is hardly surprising that the vast majority of research directions pertinent to ` large ' topological groups is left untouched by the present paper .",
    "as the first such omission , we want to mention descriptive set theory , or more exactly descriptive theory of group actions , where non - locally compact polish ( that is , completely metrizable ) topological groups appear very naturally .",
    "a topological algebraist must certainly keep one eye on further developments in the area , which provides both a motivation and a guidance for the future general theory of non - locally compact topological groups .",
    "the present author does not feel qualified to touch upon this subject , but fortunately there are excellent references available , e.g. @xcite .",
    "another omission , but this time quite purposeful , is theory of infinite - dimensional lie groups . indeed , many concrete large topological groups support a natural structure of ( @xmath4 or sometimes even analytic ) lie groups modelled over locally convex spaces of infinite dimension . while such a theory for banach  lie groups goes back to the 30 s and is well established @xcite , there are several competing versions of infinite - dimensional lie theory beyond the banach ",
    "lie case @xcite ( see also @xcite , which was referee s suggestion ) . already for lie groups",
    "modelled over nuclear frchet spaces the theory meets some difficulties of fundamental nature , the most upsetting of which is the apparent need to explicitely require the existence of exponential map : it is still an open problem whether or not a @xmath4 frchet manifold equipped with smooth group operations admits an exponential map from the tangent lie algebra at the identity ( _ loco citato _ ) .",
    "however , the reason why infinite - dimensional groups are not featured in this essay is of a different kind : for all we know , they can not be considered as mere _",
    "topological groups , _ but rather as _ topological groups with additional structure _  unlike in the finite dimensional case , where the classical montgomery ",
    "zippin theorem allows one to identify lie groups with locally euclidean topological groups !",
    "no analogue of the montromery ",
    "zippin theorem is known even for banach  lie groups .",
    "moreover , such an analogue is impossible to state in terms of topology alone , in view of the following result by keesling @xcite : every separable metrizable topological group embeds as a topological subgroup into a topological group homeomorphic to the separable hilbert space @xmath5 .",
    "( now recall that for every banach  lie group the restrictions of the two natural uniformities to a suitable neighbourhood of identity coincide , and this property , while inherited by topological subgroups , is typically absent in polish topological groups . )    finally , it is beyond reasonable doubt that topological _ semigroups _ will play an ever increasing role in theory of ` large ' topological groups .",
    "semigroups do appear in this survey on a few occasions , but present author does not feel sufficiently competent in the area to offer topological semigroups the prominent place they richly deserve .",
    "a couple of references on the subject are @xcite .",
    "the author expresses his gratitude to the organizers of the 14-th summer conference on general topology and its applications for selecting him as an invited speaker and thus offering an opportunity to put in order his thoughts about topological groups .",
    "this article is a ( somewhat extended ) write - up of the actual lecture .",
    "thanks also go to vladimir uspenskij , michael megrelishvili , and the anonymous referee for their constructive criticisms of the initial version of this paper ( dated 29.10.99 ) , and to alekos kechris for useful remarks .",
    "some of the research the article is based upon was supported by the victoria university of wellington research development fund .",
    "we will be only considering hausdorff topological groups , tychonoff topological spaces , and separated uniform spaces .",
    "a topological group @xmath2 _ acts _ on a topological space @xmath3 if there is a continuous mapping @xmath6 , called an _ action , _ where the image of a pair @xmath7 is usually denoted either by @xmath8 or simply by @xmath9 , having the properties that @xmath10 and @xmath11 for every @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here and in the sequel",
    ", @xmath14 denotes the identity element of the acting group .",
    "the entire triple @xmath15 is called an ( abstract ) _ topological dynamical system , _ while @xmath3 together with the action @xmath16 is referred to as a @xmath2_-space . _",
    "the triple @xmath17 is also known under the name a _ topological transformation group . _",
    "if the space @xmath3 is compact , a continuous action of a topological group @xmath2 on @xmath3 can be identified with a topological group homomorphism @xmath18 , where the subscript @xmath19 denotes the compact - open topology on the homeomorphism group .",
    "namely , to every element @xmath20 one associates the mapping @xmath21 which is a self - homeomorphism of @xmath3 ( with the inverse @xmath22 ) .",
    "of course , this mapping makes sense for a non - compact space @xmath3 as well , and is called a _ motion _ , or a _",
    "translation_. however , only in the case of compact @xmath3 one can always prove that the homomorphism @xmath18 is continuous .",
    "conversely , every continuous homomorphism from a topological group @xmath2 to the full homeomorphism group @xmath23 of a compact space @xmath3 determines in a unique way a continuous action of @xmath2 on @xmath3 . for general topological spaces",
    "@xmath3 the group of self - homeomorphisms @xmath24 no longer supports an apparent group topology making such a convenient identification possible , though there are important exceptions .",
    "let us single out two particularly significant classes of actions .",
    "an action is called _ effective _ if every element @xmath20 , different from the identity , acts in a non - trivial fashion on _ some _ element of the phase space @xmath3 , that is , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "an action is called _ free _ if every element @xmath28 different from the identity acts in a non - trivial way on _ every _ element of @xmath3 , that is , @xmath25 , @xmath29 , @xmath27 .",
    "every topological group acts on itself freely by left translations through @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the action of a topopological group @xmath2 on itself by conjugations , @xmath32 is effective if and only if the centre of @xmath2 is trivial .",
    "the canonical action of the group @xmath33 on the circle @xmath34 is effective but not free .",
    "the topological space @xmath3 ( the _ phase space _ ) can also support additional structures of various sort .",
    "if @xmath35 is a metric space , then an action of a topological group @xmath2 on @xmath3 is said to be _ isometric _ , or an action _ by isometries , _ if every motion @xmath36 , @xmath20 , is an isometry of @xmath3 onto itself . in this case , the continuity of the action is equivalent to the continuity of the associated homomorphism from @xmath2 to the group of isometries @xmath37 equipped with the pointwise topology ( that is , one inherited from @xmath38 , or else from @xmath39 ) .",
    "moreover , the group @xmath37 with the pointwise topology forms a hausdorff topological group .",
    "both statements are very easy to verify directly .",
    "if @xmath3 is a banach space  more precisely , a complete normed linear space  and @xmath2 acts on @xmath3 continuously , then the action @xmath16 is called a _ continuous representation of @xmath2 in @xmath40 _ if every motion @xmath41 , @xmath20 , is a linear operator .",
    "effective actions are known in this context as _",
    "faithful representations_. every such action has zero element as the fixed point and therefore can not be free .",
    "one says that the action @xmath16 on a banach space @xmath40 is _ by isometries _ if every homeomorphism of the form @xmath36 , @xmath20 , is a linear isometric transformation of @xmath3 .",
    "in such a case , the action of @xmath2 on @xmath3 is often referred to as a representation of @xmath2 in @xmath3 _ by isometries . _ for such actions instead of continuous representations one normally speaks of _ strongly continuous _ representations . to explain this peculiarity in terminology ,",
    "recall that the _ strong operator topology _ on the space @xmath42 of all bounded linear operators on a locally convex space @xmath40 is the topology of pointwise convergence , that is , one induced from the standard embedding @xmath43 , where the latter space carries the tychonoff product topology .",
    "the restriction of the strong operator topology to the group @xmath44 therefore coincides with the topology of pointwise convergence and , as we noted above , an isometric representation of @xmath2 on @xmath40 is continuous if and only if the associated homomorphism @xmath45 is continuous with respect to the strong operator topology on the latter group .",
    "finally , if @xmath46 is a ( complex ) hilbert space , then a representation @xmath16 of a group @xmath2 in @xmath47 is called _ unitary _ if every motion @xmath48 is a unitary operator : @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "it is a particular case of a representation by isometries , and in fact namely strongly continuous unitary representations of topological groups are of overwhelming importance .",
    "the collection of all unitary operators on a hilbert space @xmath47 forms a group , called the _ full unitary group _ of @xmath47 and denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "the subscript ` s ' will denote the strong operator topology , and the topological group @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 ) is one of the most important ` massive ' groups . if @xmath47 has finite dimension @xmath54 , then @xmath55 is the group of @xmath56 unitary matrices with the natural compact topology .      the following fundamental result asserts , roughly speaking , that effective actions of topological groups are sufficiently common .",
    "every hausdorff topological group @xmath2 acts effectively + ( @xmath57 ) on a banach space by isometries ; + ( @xmath58 ) on a compact space .",
    "[ teleman ]    before proceeding to the proof , we will say a few words about uniformities on topological groups .",
    "the difference between the two standard uniform structures on a topological group turns out to be surprisingly important and , in particular , provides the clue to some of the subtlest results in theory of topological groups and their actions known to date , which is why taking special care of terminology and notation is important . if @xmath2 is a topological group , then the _ right equicontinuous _",

    "the uniformity @xmath59 is right equicontinuous in the sense that the family of all right translations @xmath62 , @xmath20 , where @xmath63 , is uniformly equicontinuous as a family of mappings from the uniform space @xmath64 to itself . [",
    "the basic entourages @xmath65 are invariant with respect to the action of @xmath2 on @xmath66 on the right : @xmath67\\ ] ] the right equicontinuous uniformity is called _",

    "right equicontinuous _ is not only unambiguous but fully descriptive , we will adopt it in this article . in a similar way",
    ", one can consider the _",
    "left equicontinuous _ uniformity ( suggested notation : @xmath68 ) , determined by the basic neighbourhoods of the form @xmath69    denote by @xmath70 the vector space formed by all bounded ( real or complex - valued ) functions on @xmath2 that are uniformly continuous with respect to the right e.c .",
    "uniform structure : @xmath71 if equipped with the supremum norm , @xmath72 @xmath70 becomes a banach space .    in a similar way",
    ", one can define the banach space @xmath73 of all bounded functions that are uniformly continuous with respect to the left e.c .",
    "structure on @xmath2 .    if the two uniformities on a group @xmath2 coincide",
    ", then one says that @xmath2 is a _ sin group _",
    " from _ s_mall _ i_nvariant _ n_eighbourhoods  or else a _ balanced group_.",
    "the sin property of a topological group @xmath2 is equivalent to the existence of a neighbourhood basis at @xmath74 formed by invariant sets @xmath61 , that is , such that @xmath75 for all @xmath20 .",
    "for example , every compact and every abelian topological group are sin .",
    "another prominent example of a sin group is the full unitary group @xmath51 of a hilbert space @xmath47 equipped with the _ uniform _ ( not strong ! ) operator topology , that is , the topology induced by the natural embedding @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the closed unit ball in @xmath47 and the space of bounded continuous functions is equipped with the supremum norm .",
    "clearly , for every sin group @xmath2 the two function spaces are identical : @xmath78 rather astonishingly , it remains unknown to date if the converse is true !",
    "a similar question can be asked about spaces of functions that are not necessarily bounded : suppose @xmath79 , is then @xmath2 necessarily a sin group ?",
    "this question was first asked by itzkowitz @xcite , and a positive answer has been since obtained for a number of particular ( and quite disparate ) classes of topological groups .",
    "( see . for instance , @xcite and references contained in the paper . )",
    "it remains also unknown if the two versions of itzkowitz s question ( bounded and unbounded ones ) are equivalent between themselves .",
    "a comprehensive survey of what is known of the problem to date , written by itzkowitz himself , appears in this volume of topology proceedings .    now",
    " back to the proof of teleman s result , which is remarkably straightforward .",
    "( @xmath57 ) the group @xmath2 acts on the banach space @xmath70 by left translations : @xmath80 the action @xmath81 is easily verified to be a continuous and effective action and each operator @xmath82 is a linear isometry .",
    "the first claim is established .",
    "observe that in the above proof the group @xmath2 acts by _ left _",
    "translations on the space of functions that are uniformly continuous with respect to the _ right _ equicontinuous uniform structure ! as a particularly instructive exercise , the reader is advised to try and find where the proof breaks down if one considers the ( perfectly well - defined ) action of @xmath2 by left translations on the space @xmath73 .",
    "( @xmath58 ) the group @xmath2 acts in a natural way on the dual space of @xmath83 as follows : @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a linear functional ( an element of @xmath86 ) , @xmath20 , and @xmath87 .",
    "this action is a representation of @xmath2 in the dual banach space by isometries ( the so - called _ contragredient representation _ to the left regular representation @xmath88 ) and consequently can be restricted to the unit ball , @xmath77 , of @xmath86 .",
    "it is now an easy exercise to verify that the action of @xmath2 on @xmath77 is continuous if @xmath77 is equipped with the ( always compact ) weak@xmath89 topology ( that is , the weakest topology making each evaluation mapping of the form @xmath90 , @xmath91 continuous ) .",
    "in fact , one can verify somewhat more : that the continuous monomorphism @xmath92 is an embedding of topological subgroups . here",
    "@xmath93 is the dual ball with the weak@xmath89 topology .",
    "every topological group @xmath2 is topologically isomorphic with a subgroup of the group of homeomorphisms of a suitable compact space equipped with the compact - open topology .",
    "one can reformulate the above statement by saying that every topological group acts _ topologically effectively _ on an appropriate compact space .",
    "one of the most interesting and best known open problems related to actions of topological groups on compacta is the _",
    "smith conjecture , _ which can be given the following equivalent reformulation : if a zero - dimensional compact group @xmath2 acts effectively on a finite - dimensional topological manifold @xmath3 , then @xmath2 is necessarily finite .",

    "as it was discovered rather soon , the negative answer follows from simple set - theoretic considerations : indeed , there are more pairwise non - isomorphic separable groups than there are different subgroups in any single separable group ( _ ibid .",
    "_ ) in his comments to ulam s problem , kallman had suggested several ` corrected ' versions of the same question , one of them being as follows : does there exist a universal _ second - countable _ topological group ? apparently quite independently , the same question was promoted by arhangelski@xcite .",
    "the answer is contained in the following result , which exemplifies an interplay between embeddings and actions ( as well as massive groups such as @xmath94 undoubtedly is ) .",

    "the most important result in the affirmative direction is the following .",
    "every locally compact group @xmath2 acts freely on a compact space .",
    "the proof we shall now outline is based on a simplification of veech s original argument proposed by pym @xcite .",

    "let @xmath20 , @xmath314 , and let @xmath307 be arbitrary .",

    "hence the following corollary , which was , in fact , the _ raison dtre _ of veech s result :    every locally compact group admits an effective minimal action on a compact space .    in particular , every locally compact group admits a fixed point - free action on a compactum .    as pointed out to me by a. kechris ,",

    "the examples of this kind were hard to come by , and to the best of our knowledge , it was first done by herer and christensen @xcite ( even though they appeared to be unaware of mitchell s question ) .    before discussing such examples ,",

'    on the other hand , if @xmath2 is an amenable topological group admitting no nontrivial unitary representations , then @xmath2 has the fixed point on compacta property , that is , @xmath2 is extremely amenable . indeed , suppose that @xmath2 does not have the f.p.c .",
    ", that is , admits a nontrivial minimal action on a compact space @xmath3 .",
    "fix a point @xmath337 , and let @xmath338 be the corresponding orbit map , @xmath339 .",
    "the space @xmath168 can be made into a pre - hilbert space through endowing it with the ( positive semi - definite ) inner product : @xmath340 where @xmath171 denotes an invariant mean for @xmath2 .",
    "the group @xmath2 acts strongly continuously by isometries on the space @xmath168 , and this representation factors through to the associated hilbert space @xmath47 , giving rise to a unitary representation . to prove that the obtained unitary representation is non - trivial",

    "thus we arrive at the historically first example of a topological group satisfying f.p.c . property .",

    "finally , one invokes the tkachenko - uspenskij theorem together with an observation that the free abelian topological groups on @xmath3 and on @xmath284 sit inside the corresponding free locally convex spaces in the right way to obtain a topological group embedding @xmath544 .",
    "theorem [ lmp ] suggests that problems about free topological groups can be very difficult and substantial .",
    "imagine that someone has proved the existence of a topological embedding @xmath554 without prior knowledge of the kolmogorov superposition theorem ; such a person would be forced to essentially rediscover the solution to hilbert s problem 13 on his / her own .",
    "perhaps something of the kind indeed happens in general topology from time to time , and if anything , this shows the need for us the general topological algebraists to consciously look out for links with other areas of mathematics .",
    "let @xmath35 be a metric space , where the value of the metric @xmath555 is interpreted as the _ cost _ of transporting a unit mass from point @xmath210 to point @xmath556 .",
    "suppose a unit mass is distributed between and stored at points @xmath557 , with amounts @xmath558 at each of them , and we want to transport the mass and store it at points @xmath559 , with amount @xmath560 at each of the corresponding points .",
    "the cost of performing such a transportation is known as the _ kantorovich distance _ between @xmath561 and @xmath562 .",
    "the kantorovich distance plays a singularly important role in a wide range of applied mathematical sciences , from probability theory through information theory to computing and data storage and analysis ( for a recent comprehensive treatment , see the two - volume set @xcite exclusively devoted to the kantorovich distance ) . at the same time , it is not difficult to see that the kantorovich distance is exactly the metric generated by the maximal norm @xmath504 on the free locally convex space .",
    "as such , it can be approximated with any given degree of accuracy by the graev metric on @xmath498 .",
    "the kantorovich distance can be computed through linear programming in quadratic time in the input size , @xmath54 .",
    "an outstanding problem about the kantorovich distance is the following : does there exist an algorithm for computing the value of the distance in the _ linear _ time @xmath563 in the size of the input , @xmath54 ? currently such algorithms are only known for @xmath564 with the usual distance and also @xmath565 , the circle .",
    "the accumulated combinatorial techniques for dealing with the graev metric make free topological group theorists well - poised to tackle this problem for more general metric spaces than the real line , especially in the natural case where @xmath3 is a finite - dimensional compactum .",
    "for example , can the embedding @xmath566 constructed in the proof of theorem [ lmp ] be used to achieve an algorithmic speed - up ?    in the non - abelian case , the graev metric on the free group @xmath496 can be shown to coincide with another distance of great importance in computing : the so - called _ string edit distance _ between finite words in an alphabet @xmath205 .",
    "the value of the string edit distance between two strings ( words ) , @xmath567 and @xmath16 , is defined as the minimal number of insertions , deletions , and replacements necessary to get @xmath567 from @xmath16 .",
    "( example : @xmath568 . ) clearly , the string edit distance is recovered from the graev extension of the discrete metric from @xmath205 over @xmath569 .",
    "this type of distance is of importance in particular in molecular biology @xcite , and it is not impossible that the fluency of free topological group theorists in manipulating graev metrics can be used to improve on the existing algorithms for computing the string edit distance and its various modifications .",
    "the topic with which i would like to conclude the article provides a nice example where all our main lines of development  actions on compacta , ` massive ' groups , free topological groups , and embeddings  converge and work together in harmony .    a morphism @xmath570 between two objects in some category is called an _ epimorphism _ if for all objects @xmath263 and two arbitrary morphisms @xmath571 , the condition @xmath572 , cf .",
    "the diagram @xmath573 implies that @xmath574 .",
    "let us first consider the category of discrete groups and group homomorphisms .",
    "certainly , every homomorphism onto is an epimorphism .",
    "it turns out that the converse is also true .",
    "the following is apparently a part of the group theory folklore .",
    "it is both illuminating and essential for what follows to go through the proof .",
    "let @xmath108 , @xmath149 and @xmath2 be as in the statement of the theorem .",
    "assume that @xmath108 is not onto , and let us show that @xmath108 is not an epimorphism . to produce a group @xmath263 and two distinct morphisms @xmath575 with the property @xmath576",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "the image @xmath577 is a proper subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "denote by @xmath578 the left factor - set , that is , the collection of all left cosets @xmath579 , where @xmath432",
    ". then @xmath580 .",
    "the natural action of @xmath2 on @xmath3 by left translations extends to an action of @xmath2 on the free group @xmath496 by group isomorphisms , that is , every element @xmath432 determines a group isomorphism @xmath581 of @xmath496 , and the resulting mapping from @xmath2 to the group of automorphisms of @xmath496 is a homomorphism of groups .",
    "now one can form the _ semidirect product _",
    ", @xmath582 , corresponding to such an action .",
    "this is a group , which is , set - theoretically , the cartesian product @xmath583 , equipped with the group operation as follows : @xmath584 the identity is the element @xmath585 , while the inverse of an element @xmath586 is simply @xmath587 .",
    "notice that @xmath2 forms a subgroup ( and at the same time a factor - group ) of the semidirect product , under the embedding @xmath588 .",
    "set @xmath589 , and define two homomorphisms from @xmath2 to @xmath263 by letting @xmath28 be the above described embedding @xmath590 , while @xmath591 sends an element @xmath432 to its conjugate in @xmath263 by the element @xmath592 , where the subgroup @xmath577 is viewed as a coset and element of the free basis @xmath593 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath594 , while in general the two homomorphisms @xmath28 and @xmath591 differ ( in fact , @xmath595 whenever @xmath596 ) .",
    "the proof is finished .",
    "what happens in the category of ( hausdorff !  here it is really essential ) topological groups and continuous homomorphisms ?",
    "the most immediate observation is that if @xmath570 is a continuous homomorphism with everywhere dense range ( @xmath597 ) , then @xmath108 is an epimorphism .",
    "it was asked by karl h. hofmann in late 1960 s whether the converse was true . in other words , must every epimorphism between two topological groups have a dense range ? as we have just seen , the answer is ` yes ' if @xmath2 is discrete .",
    "it is an obvious exercise to show that the answer is positive if @xmath2 is abelian . by the end of this section ,",
    "the reader will be able to prove that the answer is positive if @xmath2 is locally compact . on a topological space",
    "@xmath3 is _ linearizable , _ that is , there exists a continuous action of @xmath2 on a locally convex space @xmath40 by isomorphisms and an embedding @xmath598 as a topological @xmath2-subspace . ] the general case , however , was only settled ( in the negative ) a few years ago by means of the following astonishing result .",
    "@xcite for further refinements . )",
    "it poses no problem at all , to make the semidirect product of two topological groups into a topological group : the usual product topology will do the trick , provided the action of the first group on the second is continuous , as a map ( in our case ) @xmath601 ( the standard reference for semidirect products of topological groups is @xcite , 2.6.20 . ) the factor - space @xmath602 is of course a topological space , so that it is natural to equip @xmath496 with the topology of the free topological group on @xmath3 . here",
    "we approach the bottleneck of the argument : the action ( [ action ] ) need not be continuous !",
    "what is worse , the situation can not be , in general , remedied by considering group topologies on @xmath496 other than the free topology .",
    "a convenient framework enabling one to deal with situations of this kind had been developed by megrelishvili independently from uspenskij s theorem [ isot ] ( though published later , @xcite ) , and we will now describe it briefly .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath263 be two topological groups .",
    "say that @xmath263 is a @xmath2_-group _ if @xmath2 continuously acts on @xmath263 by automorphisms .",
    "more precisely , there is given a continuous action @xmath603 , and every motion @xmath604 is a group automorphism .",
    "( a particular case of this situation arises whenever a topological group @xmath2 is represented in a normed space @xmath263 . )",
    "it is clear how to define morphisms between two @xmath2-groups : they are continuous homomorphisms commuting with the action of @xmath2 .",
    "now , given a topological group @xmath2 acting continuously on a topological space @xmath3 , one can define the _ free topological @xmath2-group _ on @xmath3 in a standard fashion .",
    "namely , @xmath605 is a topological @xmath2-group , and there is an ( essentially unique ) morphism of @xmath2-spaces @xmath606 with the property that each morphism of @xmath2-spaces @xmath108 from @xmath3 to an arbitrary @xmath2-group @xmath201 admits a unique factorization @xmath607 , where @xmath608 is a morphism between @xmath2-groups .",
    "for example , if @xmath609 is a trivial group , then @xmath605 turns into the free topological group on @xmath3 .",
    "the free topological @xmath2-group @xmath605 is algebraically generated by the set @xmath610 . for a given @xmath2-space @xmath3 the free topological @xmath2-group @xmath605 is the hausdorff replica of the free group @xmath496 equipped with the finest group topology such that its restriction to @xmath3 is coarser than the original topology on @xmath3 and the action @xmath611 is continuous .",
    "one says that the free topological @xmath2-group is _ trivial _ if it is isomorphic to @xmath476 equipped with the discrete topology and the trivial action of @xmath2 , in which case @xmath612 is constant and takes all of @xmath3 to @xmath613 .    getting back to our discussion of the proof of theorem [ discr ] , we can see that the right substitute for the free group @xmath496 is the free topological @xmath2-group @xmath605 on the @xmath2-space @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , everything boils down to the question of nontriviality of @xmath605 .",
    "we have practically established the following .      the _ effros microtransitivity theorem _",
    "@xcite says that if a polish (= completely metrizable second - countable ) topological group @xmath2 acts transitively on a polish space @xmath3 , then @xmath3 is isomorpic , as a @xmath2-space , with the left factor - space of @xmath2 by the isotropy subgroup @xmath614 of an arbitrary element @xmath13 .",
