    "coulombic effects are often paramount in soft matter systems , where the large dielectric constant of the solvent ( say water ) invites ionizable groups at the surface of macromolecules to dissociate @xcite .",
    "while a realistic treatment requires considering three dimensional systems , interesting progress has been achieved for lower dimensional problems where the key mechanisms can be studied in greater analytical detail @xcite . in particular , a one dimensional model was introduced in the 1960s by lenard and prager independently , for which a complete thermodynamic solution was provided @xcite .",
    "this model has been further studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it turns out that some interesting features have been overlooked in relation with the like - charge attraction phenomenon @xcite . this striking non mean - field effect , relevant for strongly coupled charged matter @xcite is the thread in our study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is first defined in section [ sec : equal - charges ] .",
    "it mimics the screening of charged colloids .",
    "the coulomb potential in one dimension between two charges @xmath1 and @xmath2 located along a line with coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 is @xmath5 therefore , the electric field created by one particle is of constant magnitude .",
    "this fact simplifies the study of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of such systems , and allows to obtain some of its properties by simple arguments .",
    "furthermore , it also allows for an explicit computation of the partition function  @xcite .",
    "the system under scrutiny can be envisioned as a collection of parallel charged plates , able to move along a perpendicular axis .",
    "the salient properties of this system can be obtained by simple arguments which we present in section [ sec : equal - charges ] , followed afterwards by a more technical analysis where the explicit calculation of the partition function is performed , first in the isobaric and then in the canonical ensemble .",
    "after having presented the symmetric case , section [ sec : different - charges ] will generalize the investigation to the situations where the two screened charges are different .",
    "noteworthy is that parity of the particle number considerations will play an important role in the remainder .",
    "consider two charges @xmath1 along a line located at @xmath6 and @xmath7 . between the charges there are @xmath0 counterions of charge @xmath8 between them .",
    "consider the equilibrium thermal properties of this system at a temperature @xmath9 , and as usual define @xmath10 with @xmath11 the boltzmann constant .",
    "this simple model mimics the screening and effective interaction between two charged colloids in a counterion solution , without added salt . in one dimension , @xmath12 has dimensions of inverse length , therefore it is convenient to use rescaled units in which all distances are measured in units of @xmath13 : @xmath14 .",
    "it is also convenient to work with a dimensionless pressure @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pressure ( equal to the force , in one dimensional systems ) .",
    "the potential energy ( dimensionless , measured in units of @xmath17 ) of the system is @xmath18 before presenting the technical analysis , we start by simple and more quantitative considerations .        the possibility of attraction between the two @xmath19 charges at @xmath20 and @xmath21 is related to the parity of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 is odd , @xmath22 , then @xmath23 counterions will form a double layer around each charge @xmath1 .",
    "this will form two compound objects with charge @xmath24 each one , located around @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "there will be in addition one counterion between these two object , which is essentially free , as the electric field created by the charges located on each side around @xmath20 and @xmath21 cancel each other . when @xmath21 is large enough , consider figure  [ fig:1dmodel - odd - attract ] .",
    "the right side of the system composed of one charge @xmath1 and @xmath23 counterions has charge @xmath25 .",
    "the left side which , for the sake of the argument , has the free counterion plus the compound charge , exhibits a total charge @xmath26 .",
    "thus the force exerted by the left side on the right side is @xmath27 , an attractive force .",
    "thus one expects that @xmath28 , for @xmath29 .",
    "mobile ions ( counter - ions ) have charge @xmath30 and the confining objects have charge @xmath1 , so that the whole system is electro - neutral . here , @xmath22 is odd , so that a single ion ( referred to as the misfit since the net electric force acting on it vanishes ) `` floats '' in between the two screened boundaries which attract , each , @xmath23 ions in their vicinity ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig:1dmodel - odd ] ) .",
    "this single free counterion provides the binding mechanism responsible for long range attraction . in the canonical treatment ,",
    "@xmath21 is held fixed , while in the isobaric situation , it is a fluctuating quantity .",
    "[ fig:1dmodel - odd - attract],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    on the other hand , if @xmath0 is even , there will not be a free counterion between the layers , which will be completely neutral , thus one expects that @xmath31 when @xmath29 , as shown in figure  [ fig:1dmodel - even ] .    ) . at large distance , the two double - layers ( made up of an ion @xmath1 and @xmath23 counter - ions ) decouple since they are neutral . no misfit ion is present to mediate attraction , and the pressure is repulsive at all distances .",
    "[ fig:1dmodel - even],scaledwidth=70.0% ]      the previous intuition , providing a large distance attraction for odd @xmath0 , can be substantiated by a simple calculation .",
    "use will be made here of the contact theorem @xcite , an exact relation between the force exerted on the charge @xmath1 , and the ionic density at contact ( stemming from the mobile charges @xmath30 ) . such a relation is particularly useful for discussing the like - charge attraction phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the argument allowing to get the contact density is two - fold , and goes as follows .",
    "leftmost counterions in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dmodel - odd - attract ] , one obtains an ion with charge @xmath32 .",
    "this newly defined system has the same large distance pressure as that of fig .",
    "[ fig:1dmodel - odd - attract ] .",
    "[ fig : argument_trick],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    first , we argue that at large @xmath21 , the @xmath23 counterions that are closest to each boundary remain in their vicinity , while the middle free counterion ( the misfit in figs .",
    "[ fig:1dmodel - odd - attract ] and [ fig:1dmodel - odd ] ) , which does not feel any electric field by symmetry , tends to be unbounded and no longer contributes to the pressure ( discarding @xmath33 terms ) . in a second step ,",
    "we thus compute the contact density in a system of an isolated charge @xmath19 , with a double - layer of @xmath23 ions in the vicinity ( the total charge of this composite object , shown on the right hand - side of fig .",
    "[ fig:1dmodel - odd - attract ] ) is @xmath25 .",
    "the solution to this problem is not immediate , but can be found by a convenient mapping onto a more convenient problem , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : argument_trick ] .",
    "as illustrated in the figure , we regroup the @xmath34 leftmost counterions in a single ion , having charge @xmath35 . at large distances ,",
    "this regroupment does not influence the distribution of counterions around the rightmost ion @xmath19 , and thus leaves the large @xmath21 pressure unaffected .",
    "the next important argument is that the pressure can be equivalently computed from the contact density at the rightmost , or leftmost charge @xmath19 .",
    "it is thus simpler to perform the calculation in the newly defined regrouped system ( left hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : argument_trick ] ) . the regrouped ion with charge",
    "@xmath35 is in the electric field of the charge @xmath1 on its left , and of the composite system on its right having charge @xmath25 .",
    "this amounts to a field @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the electric potential energy reads @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding boltzmann weight gives the density of the regrouped ion @xmath38\\ ] ] where due account was taken of normalization ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the contact density @xmath40 finally yields the pressure through the contact theorem @xmath41 .",
    "we get here @xmath42 ( or equivalently @xmath43 ) , a result which by construction holds in the large @xmath21 limit .",
    "the reason for a non vanishing pressure at large distance is that the @xmath23 counter - ions can not exactly screen the charge of an ion @xmath1 .",
    "it is no longer the case when @xmath0 is even , in which case @xmath44 for @xmath29 .",
    "the present results will be fully corroborated by direct partition function calculations .",
    "returning to the case when @xmath22 is odd , we can also estimate the first correction to the pressure for large @xmath21 . consider that @xmath21 is fixed ( canonical ensemble ) and large .",
    "since the system is somehow equivalent to two double layers with a free counterion in between , this counterion will contribute to the pressure ( denoted as @xmath45 in the canonical , fixed-@xmath21 ensemble ) with a correction @xmath33 .",
    "this estimate can be made more quantitative .",
    "the available space for the free counterion is not @xmath21 , but it is rather @xmath21 minus the space occupied by the diffuse counterion layers , given by @xmath46 the thermal average position of the @xmath23-th counterion if they have been ordered @xmath47 , in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "thus @xmath48 this is illustrated in figure  [ fig:1dmodel - odd ] . in the following section ,",
    "we evaluate explicitly @xmath49 and find @xmath50 then , for large @xmath21 , we expect @xmath51    , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in the other limiting case @xmath52 , the result is @xcite @xmath53 , that can be understood as all the @xmath0 counterions are squeezed in a small distance @xmath21 .",
    "thus we see that the pressure is positive ( repulsive force ) for small separations @xmath52 then changes to negative pressure ( attractive force ) for large @xmath21 .",
    "we will show in the following section that the @xmath54 corrections in ( [ eq : plinfty ] ) are actually exponentially small , in the canonical ensemble , therefore equation  ( [ eq : plinfty ] ) gives a fairly good approximation for the pressure for a large set of values of the separation @xmath21 . from this , one can estimate the distance @xmath55 , at which the effective force between the two charges becomes attractive @xmath56 figure  [ fig : pvsl - canon ] shows the pressure @xmath45 as a function of @xmath21 , for @xmath57 and for @xmath58 particles . for @xmath57 ( odd ) the pressure changes its sign at @xmath59 , while for @xmath58 the pressure is always positive .",
    "summarizing , in the case of odd @xmath0 , the possibility of having an effective attraction for large separations @xmath21 is due to the sharing of the `` free '' ion which leads to the creation of opposite charges objects ( ions @xmath1 plus their counterion clouds ) .",
    "although the analytical results presented here are valid only for this one - dimensional model , the same physical mechanism has also been observed in three dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "it can also be surmised that in situation of odd @xmath0 where the free counterion has a varying charge , attraction will be all the stronger as the charge will increase in absolute value . in addition , the very mechanism brought to the fore here indicates that at mean - field level , where the discrete nature of ions is discarded , attraction should be suppressed , which indeed is the case @xcite .",
    "the ( canonical ) pressure @xmath45 as a function of the separation @xmath21 , for @xmath57 ( continuous bottom line ) and @xmath58 ( dashed upper line ) . for @xmath0 odd",
    "the pressure becomes negative at large distances .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]        the equilibrium thermodynamics of the one - dimensional two - component coulomb gas was solved simultaneously but independently by lenard  @xcite and prager  @xcite . in the present model , only one type of identical particles ( the counterions )",
    "are present .",
    "it is convenient to order the particles as @xmath60 .",
    "then , rearranging the terms in ( [ eq : pot ] ) , the potential energy of the system can be written as @xmath61 and @xmath62 notice that in the case @xmath22 , the particle with position @xmath63 does not appear in the potential energy .",
    "it is the free counterion ( misfit ) discussed in the previous section , whose role is crucial for the possibility of like - charge attraction .",
    "the canonical configuration integral is @xmath64 as mentioned by lenard in his seminal paper  @xcite `` the ( configuration ) integral is elementary ( because ) the class of functions consisting of exponential of linear functions is closed under the operation of indefinite integral ( ... ) however the task of evaluating ( it ) is not trivial '' . for small",
    "@xmath0 one can compute by hand @xmath65 , and for larger given values of @xmath0 it can be obtained numerically with the aid of a computer algebra system software program . by inspection of the integral ( [ eq : z ] ) , one can deduce that @xmath65 is a linear combination of products of exponentials of @xmath21 and linear functions of @xmath21 .",
    "one can also deduce the argument of each exponential function of @xmath21 by keeping track of the factor that multiplies each @xmath66 in the integral ( [ eq : z ] ) .",
    "these come from the explicit term in @xmath67 ( for instance , for @xmath68 it is @xmath69 in the case @xmath0 odd ) , but after each successive integration , the factor of @xmath70 will by added to the one of @xmath71 due to the upper limit of integration . taking that into account , one realizes that the exponentials of @xmath21 in @xmath65 are of the form @xmath72 in the case @xmath0 odd , and @xmath73 in the case @xmath0 even .",
    "thus , the configuration canonical integral is expected to be of the form @xmath74 and @xmath75 the non trivial task is to evaluate explicitly the coefficients @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this is done in section  [ sec : canonical - exact ] .      in  @xcite ,",
    "the present system was studied , but an exact analytical explicit evaluation of the partition function for an arbitrary number of particles was not achieved .",
    "rather , an interesting reformulation of this model was proposed , by mapping it into a quantum mechanical problem , following a technique put forward by edwards and lenard  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the configuration integral is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the solution of a set of @xmath0 coupled elementary linear differential equations @xmath82 with the initial condition @xmath83 . integrating this equation one has @xmath84 then , starting from the known @xmath85 one has to perform successively @xmath0 integrals  ( [ eq : dean - system ] ) to obtain @xmath86 and the configuration integral .",
    "this task is equivalent to performing directly the @xmath0 integrals of the configuration integral  ( [ eq : z ] ) .",
    "thus , unfortunately , the method proposed in  @xcite does not provide any computational advantage over a direct numerical evaluation of the partition function .    here",
    ", our goal is to obtain an explicit analytical expression for the configuration integral for an arbitrary number of particles @xmath0 .",
    "using lenard  @xcite and prager  @xcite method , we will first compute the partition function of the constant pressure ensemble @xmath87 which is the laplace transform of the canonical configuration integral @xmath65 .",
    "this is a straightforward application of the technique of lenard and prager , and it is actually much simpler than the complete work presented in  @xcite , since all particles are identical and we will not have to deal with the combinatorial problem of studying the different configurations of charges .",
    "then , we shall invert the laplace transform to obtain the canonical , constant `` volume '' @xmath21 , configuration integral @xmath88 . since we are interested in finite systems , the results from the canonical ensemble and the constant pressure ensemble will differ , and it is of interest to compare them .",
    "to introduce the technique used to compute the partition function , we undertake in this section a preliminary , simpler task , based on the same technique : the exact evaluation of the diffuse layer size @xmath49 .",
    "this quantity appeared in the discussion of section  [ sec : like - charge - attraction ] .",
    "consider here that @xmath29 and @xmath22 . the double layer composed by the charge @xmath1 at @xmath21 and its corresponding @xmath23 counterions are thereby ` sent to infinity ' .",
