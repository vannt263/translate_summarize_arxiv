    "neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite  have revealed undeniable evidence for flavour non - conservation in the lepton sector .",
    "flavour neutrino eigenstates , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , oscillate , changing their lepton flavour quantum number @xcite , due to non - zero neutrino masses and neutrino mixing .",
    "the latter is parametrized by the well known pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) neutrino mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "all present neutrino oscillation data can be described assuming 3-flavour neutrino mixing in vacuum .",
    "the number of massive neutrinos can , in general , be bigger than 3 , if , for instance , there exist right - handed ( rh ) sterile neutrinos @xcite and they mix with the left - handed ( lh ) flavour neutrinos .",
    "it follows from the existing data that at least 3 of the neutrinos must be light , with masses @xmath7 , @xmath8 ev and at least two of the @xmath9 different from zero . at present there are no compelling experimental evidences for the existence of more than 3 light neutrinos .    the smallness of neutrino masses , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the electron mass , suggests the presence of a new fundamental scale in particle physics and thus to new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . among the possible extensions of the sm which can explain neutrino mass generation , a well known proposal is the see - saw mechanism @xcite . in its simplest formulation ,",
    "the type i see - saw scenario , at least two `` heavy '' @xmath12 singlet rh neutrinos @xmath13 are introduced in the theory . within the see - saw framework ,",
    "the latter are assumed to possess a majorana mass term as well as yukawa type couplings with the standard model lepton and higgs doublets .    below the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking scale ,",
    "the light neutrino masses arise from the lagrangian : @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 being the charge conjugation matrix , @xmath18 is the @xmath19 majorana mass matrix of the rh neutrinos , and @xmath20 is the @xmath21 neutrino dirac mass matrix , which is generated by the matrix of neutrino yukawa couplings after the ew symmetry breaking : @xmath22 , @xmath23 being the matrix of neutrino yukawa couplings and @xmath24 gev being the v.e.v . of the sm higgs doublet .",
    "the matrices @xmath25 and @xmath20 are complex , in general .",
    "a majorana mass term @xmath26 for the active left - handed neutrinos is indeed generated by the interplay between the dirac mass term and the majorana mass term of the heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "the well know see - saw mass relation is in this case : @xmath27 .    in grand",
    "unified theories , @xmath20 is typically of the order of the charged fermion masses . in @xmath28 theories , for instance , @xmath20 coincides with the up - quark mass matrix .",
    "taking indicatively @xmath29 ev , @xmath30 gev , one finds @xmath31 gev , which is close to the scale of unification of the electroweak and strong interactions , @xmath32 gev . in gut theories with rh neutrinos",
    "one finds that indeed the heavy majorana neutrinos naturally obtain masses which are by few to several orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath25 thus obtained is effectively based on the assumption that the neutrino yukawa couplings are large : @xmath34 .",
    "the alternative possibility is to have heavy majorana neutrino masses in the range of @xmath35 gev , i.e. tev scale see - saw generation of neutrino masses .",
    "this possibility has been recently revisited by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite and references quoted therein ) .    following the discussion reported in @xcite , the low - energy neutrino physics constraints on the tev scale type i see - saw scenarios",
    "are reviewed .",
    "in particular , it is analyzed in detail , within three different frameworks relying on the type i see - saw extension of the sm , the possibility of observing @xmath36 processes at current and future particle accelerators , lhc included , due to the production and decays of the heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "following the formalism developed in @xcite , after the diagonalization of the full neutrino mass matrix in ( [ typei ] ) , the charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) weak interactions involving the light majorana neutrinos @xmath38 with definite mass @xmath39 are @xmath40 the unitary matrix @xmath41 diagonalizes the light majorana mass matrix , @xmath42 . in the basis in which the three charged lepton fields are equal to the respective mass eigenstates , @xmath41 corresponds to the pmns neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the hermitian matrix @xmath43 , therefore , parametrizes the deviation from unitarity of the neutrino mixing matrix due to the mixing of the flavour neutrino fields @xmath5 with the heavy rh fields in the neutrino mass lagrangian ( [ typei ] ) .",
    "as shown below , @xmath43 depends on a combination of the see - saw parameters responsible for lepton flavour violating processes .",
    "notice that in deriving the expressions of the cc and nc weak interactions it is implicitly assumed that @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , for sm singlet fermions with masses above the ew symmetry breaking scale , i.e. bigger than @xmath45 100 gev , the combined data on neutrino oscillation experiments and ew interaction processes provide the upper bound @xcite : @xmath46 .    the charged current and the neutral current interactions of the heavy majorana neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath4 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 formally read @xcite : @xmath49 where the unitary matrix @xmath50 diagonalizes the rh neutrino mass term in ( [ typei ] ) , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the experimental limits on the deviations from unitarity in the neutrino mixing matrix affect the couplings @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , in this class of models @xcite : @xmath54 .",
    "it is important to remark that , apart from non - unitarity effects , further constraints on @xmath53 and/or a particular combination of them can be obtained at low energy considering @xmath55 the scale of the symmetric matrix @xmath56 ev , resulting from the see - saw mechanism of generation of neutrino masses , and @xmath57 from the experimental upper bound on the effective majorana mass , @xmath58 @xcite , which enters in the expression of the @xmath37-decay rate of even - even nuclei ( see e.g. @xcite ) . indeed , for the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath59 with masses @xmath60 gev , barring `` accidental '' cancellations or extreme fine - tuning ( at the level of @xmath61 ) , the constraint @xmath55 implies : @xmath62 the estimate of @xmath63 thus obtained makes the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath4 practically unobservable at particle accelerators ( see e.g. @xcite ) .  in order for the cc and nc couplings of the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath4 to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , eqs ( [ ncc ] ) and ( [ nnc ] ) , to be sufficiently large ,",
    "that is @xmath64 , so that the see - saw mechanism could be partially or completely tested in experiments at the currently operating and planned future accelerators ( lhc included ) , the small size of the @xmath26 matrix elements should be due to strong mutual compensation between the parameters that enter in the see - saw mass relation . in general , such cancellations arise naturally from symmetries in the lepton sector , corresponding , for instance , to the conservation of some additive lepton charge @xmath65 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in the limit in which @xmath65 is exact , the rh neutrinos @xmath66 ( @xmath16 ) should be dirac particles , which is possible for all heavy neutrinos only if the number of the rh singlet neutrino fields is even : @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "if their number is odd , barring again `` accidental '' cancellations , some ( odd number ) of the discussed heavy majorana neutrinos will have strongly suppressed couplings to the @xmath69 and charged leptons and will be practically unobservable in the current and the future planned accelerator experiments .",
    "the resulting mass spectrum will depend on the assumed total lepton charge @xmath65 . indeed , if @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) are the ordinary lepton charges of the fermion fields , in the basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , the conserved lepton charge @xmath65 takes the general form : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath71 , with at least one @xmath75 .",
    "in this case , it can be shown @xcite that the number of massive dirac neutrinos and massless neutrinos in the theory is , respectively , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) is the number of ordinary lepton charges in ( [ lc ] ) which enter with the plus ( minus ) sign .",
    "the correct light majorana neutrino mass spectrum can be generated by small perturbations that violate the corresponding symmetry @xmath65 . in this case , each massive dirac neutrino is split into two majorana neutrinos with close but different masses , i.e.  the dirac neutrinos become pseudo - dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "typically , for @xmath80 , the expected splitting between the masses of the two heavy majorana neutrinos forming a pseudo - dirac pair , is roughly 1 ( 100 ) mev for masses of the order of 100 ( 1000 ) gev .",
    "such small mass difference will not be observable at lhc and planned future accelerator experiments , thus preventing any possible experimental test at collider of the majorana nature of the heavy majorana neutrinos of the type i see - saw mechanism .",
    "the other low energy constraint to the see - saw parameter space , strictly related to the majorana nature of the heavy and light majorana neutrinos , is provided by @xmath37-decay experiments @xcite . in this case , in addition to the standard contribution due to the light majorana neutrino exchange , the @xmath37-decay effective majorana mass @xmath58 receives a contribution from the exchange of the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath59 : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a known real ( positive ) function of the atomic number @xmath83 of the decaying nucleus and of the mass @xmath84 of @xmath59 @xcite . for the range @xmath85 gev of interest",
    ", one has with good approximation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath86 , with @xmath87 gev and @xmath88 .",
    "it is shown in the following that , within the type i see - saw scenario of generation of light neutrino masses , if @xmath89 arises as result of the breaking of a global symmetry corresponding to some conserved lepton charge @xmath65 , the majorana nature of the heavy majorana neutrinos could be hardly tested at collider physics . as stated before , the reason is that if the heavy majorana fields involved in the see - saw mechanism of lh neutrino mass generation , have couplings to charged leptons and weak gauge bosons sufficiently large to produce and observe them at collider , they would behave effectively as a pseudo - dirac fermion and all lepton number violating processes , e.g.  same sign di - muon production in proton - proton collisions , would be strongly suppressed .",
    "consider for simplicity the case of three rh neutrinos @xmath66 ( @xmath90 ) and a conserved lepton charged @xmath91 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a possible choice of the dirac and majorana mass matrix which preserves @xmath65 is : @xmath92 where , without loss of generality , all the parameters in @xmath20 and @xmath25 are taken real and positive . as a consequence of the simplifying choice made , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , the majorana field @xmath95",
    "is decoupled and does not take part in the see - saw mechanism of generation of lh neutrino masses . in this case @xmath96 and @xmath97 and the spectrum of the theory contains 3 massless neutrinos and 1 massive dirac fermion .",
    "the latter is given by the combination @xmath98 and has a mass @xmath99 , where the two heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath100 and @xmath101 have the same mass @xmath102 and satisfy the majorana conditions @xmath103 , @xmath104 , with @xmath105 and @xmath106 .    in order to have a light neutrino mass spectrum compatible with the observations ,",
    "it is necessary to softly break @xmath65 .",
    "taking @xmath107 , it is easy to show @xcite that two of the light neutrinos acquire a finite mass , @xmath108 , while the dirac fermion @xmath109 is split into two different majorana fields @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath110 , where @xmath83 depends explicitly on the lepton charge breaking parameters @xmath111 : @xmath112 .",
    "the light neutrino mass scale , @xmath113 ev , imposes strong constraints on the symmetry breaking parameters .",
    "more explicitly , for @xmath114 gev one has : @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) . because of the small mass splitting @xmath117 , the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath118 effectively behave in the collider physics as a pseudo - dirac fermion @xmath119 .",
    "consider now the process of same sign di - muon production in proton - proton collisions , assuming that one of the muons , say @xmath120 , is produced together with real or virtual @xmath118 in the decay of a virtual @xmath121 , while the second @xmath120 originates from the decay @xmath122 , with virtual or real @xmath123 which decays further into , e.g.  two hadronic jets .  in order to collect a sufficiently large number of events ,",
    "it is necessary to have sizable couplings of the heavy majorana neutrinos to the muon field .",
    "the latter can be easily computed @xcite : @xmath124 and @xmath125 , with @xmath126 . in the present scenario",
    "@xmath127 because @xmath100 and @xmath101 form a pseudo - dirac fermion . if , for instance , @xmath128 gev and @xmath129 , one obtains @xmath130 gev and @xmath65 charge breaking parameter @xmath131 ev , due to the constraint which arises from the small neutrino masse scale ( see the discussion above ) .",
    "the relevant part for the amplitude of the process under discussion is @xcite : @xmath132 taking into account that @xmath133 and @xmath134 , it is easy to show that the amplitude for this lepton number violating process is proportional to the factor @xmath135 . as discussed previously , in the pseudo - dirac scenario of interest , which is consequence of an almost conserved lepton charge present in the theory , the heavy majorana neutrino mass splitting",
    "is strongly bounded by the light neutrino mass scale , @xmath136 ev , thus making the same sign di - muon production at lhc unobservable .",
    "a simple realization of this scenario is obtained from the mass textures reported in eq .",
    "( [ see - saw masses ] ) , in which the majorana mass matrix , @xmath25 , is conveniently modified with the @xmath65-breaking mass term : @xmath138 . in this case , even if lepton number is not conserved , at leading order one has @xmath139 and , therefore , the tree - level constraints on the see - saw parameter space from the light neutrino mass scale do not apply here : light neutrino masses , compatible with neutrino data , can be generated at higher order ( one or two loops ) .",
    "this in turn could lead to sufficiently large @xmath118 production rates at lhc to make the observation of the two heavy majorana neutrinos possible .",
    "indeed , in such scenario @xmath140 and , in principle , one can observe the same sign di - muon production at lhc for a sufficiently large mass splitting ( see eq .",
    "( [ ppmumu2 ] ) ) .",
    "anyway , it should be clear from the preceding discussion that all @xmath3 majorana type effects should vanish in the limit of @xmath141 .    as discussed before ,",
    "in such class of models , the heavy majorana neutrinos might provide a sizable contribution to the -decay rate .",
    "indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ mee1 ] ) , neglecting the standard contribution due to the tree - level exchange of light majorana neutrino mass eigenstates , the effective majorana mass @xmath58 results proportional to the mass splitting @xmath117 @xcite : @xmath142 if @xmath143 will be determined from an independent measurement , the bound on @xmath58 will lead to a strong constraint on @xmath144 . taking e.g.  @xmath145 ev , @xmath146 ( corresponding to @xmath147ge ) and the maximal value of @xmath143 allowed by the non - unitarity constraints ( see @xcite ) , @xmath148 , one finds : @xmath149 .  for @xmath150 gev",
    "this implies @xmath151 .",
    "such a small mass difference would render the majorana - type effects associated with @xmath118 hardly observable .",
    "if , however , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and a signature of the process @xmath154 , generated by the production and decay of real or virtual @xmath118 , is detectable at lhc .",
    "consider now the type i see - saw lagrangian in which the rh neutrino masses are given between ( @xmath155 ) gev and the see - saw mechanism provides the observed lh neutrino mass scale and mixing without assuming any softly broken conserved lepton charge in the theory .",
    "this possibility requires , in general , a huge tuning of parameters .",
    "namely , demanding @xmath156 and @xmath157 requires a tuning of one part in @xmath158 in order to produce a neutrino mass @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "unlike the case discussed earlier , now the see - saw parameter space is constrained by both the small light neutrino mass scale , @xmath160 ev , and the upper bound on the effective majorana mass in -decay experiments .",
    "consider , for instance , the two heavy majorana neutrinos mass eigenstates @xmath100 and @xmath101 with masses @xmath161 and @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and satisfying standard majorana conditions , @xmath164 .",
    "for large neutrino yukawa couplings , the cc and nc weak interactions of @xmath100 and @xmath101 with charged leptons and gauge bosons , eqs  ( [ ncc ] ) and ( [ nnc ] ) , satisfy , with a good approximation , the relation @xcite : @xmath165 ( @xmath6 ) , with @xmath166 . from eq .",
    "( [ mee1 ] ) , neglecting again the contribution due to the exchange of the light majorana neutrino mass eigenstates , the effective majorana mass is given by @xmath167 assuming production and detection of the rh majorana fields at collider , i.e. @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) , one has that @xmath170 ev for @xmath171 and @xmath172 gev .",
    "therefore , the non - observation of the @xmath173-decay requires in this scenario a degeneracy in the right - handed neutrino masses of at least one per cent . as discussed above , the cross section for same sign di - muon production in proton - proton collisions is proportional to the mass difference of the right - handed neutrinos",
    ". thus , even in this extremely fined - tuned scenario , the majorana nature of the right - handed neutrinos will be difficult to probe at colliders .",
    "the see - saw mechanism provides a natural explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses . in such scenario ,",
    "a new mass scale is introduced in the theory , which is linked to the light neutrino mass scale and can in principle be accessible to present and forthcoming particle physics accelerators , lhc included . in its simplest formulation ,",
    "the type i see - saw scenario , the standard model ( sm ) is extended with at least two `` heavy '' majorana neutrinos , which are singlets of @xmath174 and are coupled to the sm lepton and higgs doublets .",
    "it is shown that , if the type i see - saw scenario provides the correct mechanism of generation of light neutrino masses and the majorana fields @xmath1 have masses in the range @xmath2 gev , the physical effects associated with the majorana nature of these heavy neutrinos @xmath4 , are so small that they are unlikely to be observable in the currently operating and future planned accelerator experiments ( including lhc ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the existence of very strong constraints on the parameters and couplings , responsible for the corresponding @xmath3 processes in which @xmath4 are involved , and/or on the couplings of @xmath4 to the weak @xmath69 and @xmath48 bosons .",
    "the strongest constraints are provided by the experimental upper limit on @xmath55 the light neutrino mass matrix , @xmath175 ev , @xmath176 and @xmath57 the effective majorana mass @xmath58 obtained in the @xmath37-decay experiments .",
    "the latter , is sensitive to the heavy majorana neutrino mass scale and splitting(s ) .    as consequence",
    ", it is shown that charged and neutral current interactions of the heavy majorana fields @xmath4 with the standard model charged leptons and neutrinos are extremely suppressed , unless the heavy majorana neutrinos form a pseudo - dirac pair .",
    "therefore , the majorana nature of the heavy neutrinos will not be detected in collider experiments : either the production cross section is highly suppressed or the heavy neutrinos behave to a high level of precision as dirac fermions .    the suppression of the @xmath36 processes can be avoided only if there exist additional tev scale interaction terms in the lagrangian between the heavy majorana neutrinos and the standard model particles .",
    "if this is the case , the production cross section of heavy neutrinos will not necessarily be suppressed , while their charged and neutral current interactions with the standard model charged leptons and neutrinos can still be tiny .",

    "<S> conversely , the observation of effects proving the majorana nature of @xmath4 would imply that these heavy neutrinos have additional relatively strong couplings to the standard model particles or that light neutrino masses compatible with the observations are generated by a mechanism other than see - saw ( e.g. , radiatively at one or two loop level ) in which the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath4 are nevertheless involved . </S>"
