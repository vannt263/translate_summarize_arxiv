    "the occupation fraction is arbitrarily set to unity but can be easily scaled down to account for a reduced mbh formation efficiency on these small subhalo mass scales .",
    "two large subpopulations of galactic black holes can then be readily identified today within @xmath45 , 798  naked \" imbhs , whose host subhalos have been totally disrupted after infall , and 1,234  clothed \" imbhs residing in satellites that survived tidal stripping .",

    "these authors also identified a population of  naked \" imbhs following the tidal disruption of infalling satellites , but their estimated naked fraction appears smaller than we find in our simulations ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) . as expected , in both calculations ( as well as in those of @xcite )",
    "there are more naked holes near the center of the host , where tidal forces are stronger .",
    "indeed , within 10 kpc of the center , most imbhs are naked .    within the  clothed \" category , 1,096 are single black hole systems , i.e.",
    "are located in subhalos that host only one hole at the present epoch .",
    "the others are multiple systems : we find 42 dwarf subhalos with 2 holes , 7 with 3 , 5 with 4 , and 1 with each of 6 and 7 holes .",
    "these multiple systems are produced when their host subhalos merge together after infall , as they fall into the main halo in groups .",
    "we assume that by that time , ram pressure stripping has removed any leftover gas from the system , making it difficult for imbhs to sink to the center of the potential well and merge .",

    "indeed , within 10 kpc of the center , most imbhs are naked . the second most massive hole ( after `` sgr a@xmath22 '' ) has @xmath47 ( i.e. was tagged at infall in a large satellite with @xmath48 ) , is naked , and is located at a distance of 55 kpc from the center .",

    "models in which seed black holes become very rare for halos with @xmath51 have been recently discussed by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here , we take the hole occupation fraction to be of order unity in all subhalos with stellar velocity dispersions @xmath52 , and to drop to zero below @xmath1 .",
    "black hole masses are again assigned following equation ( [ msigma ] ) down to @xmath1 .",
    "the mass distribution of subahalos hosting central black holes at infall now has a median of @xmath53 , and the minimum hole mass is @xmath54 .",
    "again , this scenario is not based on a specific physical model but is simply meant to be illustrative of a situation in which dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way with stellar velocity dispersions comparable to that of ursa minor ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a compilation ) would actually host an imbh .",
    "recent observations have shown that dwarf galaxies with stellar masses comparable to the magellanic clouds do exhibit optical spectroscopic signatures of accreting mbhs @xcite .",
    "note that , in the models of @xcite , halos with virial masses above @xmath53 are predicted to always host a mbh seed , regardless of the seed formation efficiency .",
    "this is because , even in the lowest efficiency case , mbh seeds form in the region of earliest star formation , which tend to be the halos that becomes the most massive later on in every simulation .",
    "moreover , the most massive halos have also experienced the greatest number of mergers , and are then populated by mbh seeds brought in by satellites .",
    "the tagging prescription adopted in this scenario gives origin to 39 naked and 33 clothed imbhs ( of which 27 are single systems ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ( right panels ) shows an image of the projected spatial distribution of imbhs in today s inner and outer galactic halo according to this model , while figure [ fig3 ] ( left panel ) depicts their mass function .",
    "there are 20 imbhs above @xmath55 , of which 13 are naked .",
    "the asymmetric emission of gravitational waves produced during the coalescence of a binary black hole system imparts a velocity kick to the system that can displace the hole from the center of its host .",
    "the magnitude of the recoil will depend on the binary mass ratio and the direction and magnitude of their spins @xcite , but not on the total mass of the binary .",
    "when the kick velocity is larger than the escape speed of the host halo , a hole may be ejected into intergalactic space before becoming a galactic imbh .",
    "the demography of imbhs discussed in the previous section accounts for recoiling holes as follows .    following the results of high - resolution self - consistent gasdynamical simulations of binary mergers of disk galaxies by @xcite",
    ", we assume that unequal - mass galaxy mergers with mass ratios larger than 4:1 will not lead to the formation of a close black hole pair at the center of the remnant , and hence of a recoiling hole .",
    "all major mergers ( mass ratios smaller than 4:1 ) produce instead recoiling holes with a kick velocity that is equal to the most likely value of the probability distribution function for randomly oriented spins ( see fig . 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "in practice , this means that all recoiling holes will have speeds in excess of @xmath56 and will be ejected from the system .",
    "this is a conservative assumption in the sense that it tends to minimize the actual number of relic imbhs in the galactic halo .",
    "we trace all @xmath574:1 halo mergers following the vlii merger tree back to redshift 10 .",
    "this was built by identifying all subhalos in each snapshot with the 6dfof halo finder @xcite , and linking them from one snapshot to the next by the i d numbers of the shared particles .",
    "we identify all halos that would have been assigned a hole at infall , but had in their past a @xmath574:1 major merger with another black hole - hosting system . as",

    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the total number of halo major mergers that produce recoiling imbhs in the  pop iii \" and  direct collapse \" seed scenarios .",
    "the former produces 577 recoiling holes ( 22% of the total black hole population ) , mostly belonging to @xmath73 subhalos at infall .",
    "the latter produces only 5 recoiling holes ( 6% of the total ) all from rather massive hosts .",
    "note that it is because of recoils that the number of galactic imbhs heavier than a few thousand solar masses is actually larger in the direct collapse model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the demography of galactic imbhs in our two scenarios is summarized in table [ tab : multimodel ] .",
    "the spatial distribution of galactic imbhs today is shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "naked holes dominate in the inner @xmath74 50 kpc from the halo center . their number density , however , plummets at larger distances , where most imbhs are still hosted in surviving substructures .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that subhalos orbiting closer to the dense central regions of the main host are more likely to be tidally disrupted , and leave their imbhs exposed . in the outer halo regions , the lower background density makes substructures more resilient to tidal forces , allowing them to survive and retain their holes .",
    "a comparison of the imbh number density to the density profile of the dark matter shows that the cumulative distribution of galactic imbhs ( naked plus clothed ) follows the dark matter profile rather well , but that each individual subpopulation does not .",
    "the inset in figure [ fig5 ] shows that the imbh mass density profile does not follow the density profile of the dark matter , as most of the mass in black holes is concentrated in the inner regions .",
    "since naked imbhs more massive than dark matter particles do not experience proper dynamical friction in our simulation , we have estimated a posteriori the effect of black hole orbital decay in two different ways  using the slowly - decaying circular orbit approximation , as well as computing the instantaneous deceleration from dynamical friction @xcite in each available vlii snapshot .",
    "we find that , even for the heaviest imbhs in the highest density regions of our simulation , dynamical friction timescales exceed the hubble time at all points along the orbit .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite in their study .",
    "of course , our n - body simulation does not account for possible hydrodynamical effects and interactions with the galaxy stellar disk in the very center of the vlii halo .",
    "we have used a particle tagging technique to populate the subgalactic building blocks of a present - day mw - sized galaxy with black holes , and assess the size , properties , and detectability of the leftover population .",
    "our approach combines a computationally expensive , extreme - resolution , n - body simulation like vlii , in which structures grow ab initio in a fully cosmological framework , with simple prescriptions for seeding , in post - processing , progenitor subhalos with imbhs . insofar baryonic material does not appreciably perturb the collisionless dynamics of the n - body component",
    ", the dynamical association of black holes with individual particles in the n - body component should correctly reproduce the spatial and kinematic properties of imbhs in galaxy halos , in particular of the naked subpopulation whose host satellite galaxies have been totally destroyed after infall .",
    "this level of detail is unavailable to a standard merger - tree approach .",
    "we have discussed two simple models of seed hole formation that may be illustrative of more realistic growth scenarios , a ",
    "pop iii remnant \" model in which small - mass black holes populate subhalos with stellar velocity dispersion as low as @xmath75 , and a  direct collapse precursor \" model in which holes become very rare in systems with stellar velocity dispersion below @xmath76 , and are more massive .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the pop iii route does not necessarily require the formation of extremely massive stars from gas of primordial composition . already at metallicities @xmath77 ,",
    "the mass loss rates of massive stars through radiatively driven stellar winds are predicted to be rather small ( with rates decreasing with metallicity as @xmath78 , see * ? ? ?",
    "if low - metallicity stars above @xmath79 collapse to black holes after losing only a small fraction of their initial mass , then imbhs with masses above the @xmath80 range of known  stellar - mass \" holes may be the inevitable end product of early star formation .",

    "after the complete disruption of their host subhalo , naked imbhs are still expected to carry with them a bahcall - wolf stellar cusp @xcite which , upon formation and in the absence of a kick from gravitational recoil , has a mass of order the mass of the hole and an extent of order the hole s radius of influence , @xmath86 throughout their dynamical evolution , these stellar clusters will lose mass by relaxation and expansion , as well as tidal disruptions by the black hole @xcite .",
    "the relaxation timescale , @xmath87 ranges from several myr for the smallest imbhs to a gyr for the largest .",
    "as imbhs get accreted by the milky way early in the history of the universe , the above processes can cause a 60 - 80% fractional loss of stellar mass by the present day @xcite . at the same time",

    "assuming that the initial extent of the clusters is dictated by the imbh s sphere of influence at infall , their physical extent today would range between 0.5 and 1.0 pc . despite their expansion , stellar clusters surrounding imbhs would still be very compact today and may appear point - like or extended depending on their distance .",

    "the resulting distribution of peak brightness for the imbh stellar clusters would have to be further scaled down by a factor of 5 , to account for the limited sky coverage of the sdss . after accounting for these corrections , only a handful of clusters should be detectable with current surveys .",
    "this is consistent with a recent search for stellar clusters surrounding recoiled imbhs in the sdss source catalog that resulted in an upper limit of 100 candidates in the milky way halo @xcite .",
    "we have also estimated the proper motion of imbhs on the sky .",
    "having tangential velocities ranging from 0 to 250 @xmath93 as seen from an observer at 8 kpc from the vlii halo center , and distances of up to 100 kpc , their proper motions fall in the range between 0.1 and 10 milliarcsec year@xmath94 .",
