    "universe seems to exhibit an interesting symmetry with regard to accelerated expansion .",
    "it has gone under inflation at early epochs and is believed to be accelerating at present .",
    "the inflationary paradigm was originally introduced to address the initial value problems of the standard hot big bang model .",
    "only later it became clear that the scenario could provide important clues for the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "the recent measurement of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) made it clear that ( i ) the current state of the universe is very close to a critical density and that ( ii ) primordial density perturbations that seeded large - scale structure in the universe are nearly scale - invariant and gaussian , which are consistent with the inflationary paradigm .",
    "inflation is often implemented with a single or multiple scalar - field models@xcite ( also see the excellent review on inflation by shinji tsujikawa@xcite ) . in most of these models ,",
    "the scalar field undergoes a slow - roll period allowing an accelerated expansion of the universe . after drawing the required amount of inflation",
    ", the inflaton enters the regime of quasi - periodic oscillation where it quickly oscillates and decays into particles leading to ( p)reheating .    as for the current accelerating of universe ,",
    "it is supported by observations of high redshift type ia supernovae treated as standardized candles and , more indirectly , by observations of the cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering . within the framework of general relativity",
    ", cosmic acceleration should be sourced by an energy - momentum tensor which has a large negative pressure ( dark energy)@xcite . therefore",
    ", the standard model should , in order to comply with the logical consistency and observation , be sandwiched between inflation at early epochs and quintessence at late times .",
    "it is natural to ask whether one can build a model with scalar fields to join the two ends without disturbing the thermal history of universe .",
    "attempts have been made to unify both these concepts using models with a single scalar field @xcite.in these models , the scalar field exhibits the properties of tracker field . as a result it goes into hiding after the commencement of radiation domination ; it emerges from the shadow only at late times to account for the observed accelerated expansion of universe .",
    "these models belong to the category of _ non oscillating _ models in which the standard reheating mechanism does not work . in this case",
    ", one can employ an alternative mechanism of reheating via quantum - mechanical particle production in time varying gravitational field at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "however , then the inflaton energy density should red - shift faster than that of the produced particles so that radiation domination could commence . and",
    "this requires a steep field potential , which of course , can not support inflation in the standard frw cosmology .",
    "this is precisely where the brane@xcite assisted inflation comes to the rescue .",
    "the presence of the quadratic density term ( high energy corrections ) in the friedman equation on the brane changes the expansion dynamics at early epochs @xcite(see ref@xcite for details on the dynamics of brane worlds ) consequently , the field experiences greater damping and rolls down its potential slower than it would during the conventional inflation .",
    "thus , inflation in the brane world scenario can successfully occur for very steep potentials@xcite .",
    "the model of quintessential inflation based upon reheating via gravitational particle production is faced with difficulties associated with excessive production of gravity waves .",
    "indeed the reheating mechanism based upon this process is extremely inefficient .",
    "the energy density of so produced radiation is typically one part in @xmath0@xcite to the scalar - field energy density at the end of inflation . as a result",
    ", these models have prolonged kinetic regime during which the amplitude of primordial gravity waves enhances and violates the nucleosynthesis constraint@xcite(see also @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it is necessary to look for alternative mechanisms more efficient than the gravitational particle production to address the problem .",
    "a proposal of reheating with born - infeld matter was made in ref@xcite(see also ref@xcite on the related theme ) .",
    "it was shown that reheating is quite efficient and the model does not require any additional fine tuning of parameters@xcite",
    ". however , the model works under several assumptions which are not easy to justify .",
    "the problems associated with reheating mechanisms discussed above can be circumvented if one invokes an alternative method of reheating , namely ` instant preheating ' proposed by felder , kofman and linde @xcite ( see also ref@xcite on the related theme . for other approaches to reheating in quintessential inflation see @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism is quite efficient and robust , and is well suited to non - oscillating models .",
    "it describes a new method of realizing quintessential inflation on the brane in which inflation is followed by ` instant preheating ' .",
    "the larger reheating temperature in this model results in a smaller amplitude of relic gravity waves which is consistent with the nucleosynthesis bounds@xcite .",
    "however , the recent measurement of cmb anisotropies by wmap places fairly strong constraints on inflationary models @xcite .",
    "it seems that the steep brane world inflation is on the the verge of being ruled out by the observations@xcite .",

    "quintessential inflation aims to describe a scenario in which both inflation and dark energy ( quintessence ) are described by the same scalar field .",
    "the unification of these concepts in a single scalar field model imposes certain constraints which were spelled out in the introduction .",

    "the brane world inflation with steep potentials becomes possible due to high energy corrections in the friedmann equation .",
    "the exit from inflation also takes place naturally when the high energy corrections become unimportant .    in the 4 + 1 dimensional brane scenario inspired by the randall - sundrum @xcite model , the standard friedman equation",

    "the four dimensional cosmological constant @xmath4 can be made to vanish by appropriately tuning the brane tension .",

    "this effect is reflected in the slow - roll parameters which have the form @xcite & = & _ frw , + & = & _ frw(1 + v/2_b ) ^-1 , [ eq : slow - rollbrane ] where _ frw = ( ) ^2 , _ frw = m_p^2 ( ) [ eq : slow_frw ] are slow roll parameters in the absence of brane corrections .",

    "the potential becomes too steep to sustain inflation and for larger values @xmath18 the field enters a kinetic regime during which field energy density @xmath19 .",

    "it is therefore clear that the field energy density in the post inflationary regime would keep tracking the background being subdominant such that it does not interfere with the thermal history of the universe .    within the framework of the braneworld scenario",

    "as shown in @xcite , the energy density @xmath88 scales as radiation when @xmath94 . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the born - infeld matter energy density starts scaling slowly ( logarithmically ) with the scale factor to mimic the cosmological constant like behavior .",
    "the point is that the born - infeld matter is subdominant during the inflationary stage .",
    "it comes to play the important role after the end of inflation when it behaves like radiation and hence serves as an alternative to reheating mechanism .",
    "the brane world cosmology based upon the born - infeld action looks promising as it is perfectly tuned with the d - brane ideology .",
    "but since the born - infeld action is composed of the non - linear elecromagnetic field , the d - brane cosmology proposed in ref@xcite can not accommodate density perturbations at least in its present formulation .",
    "one could include a scalar field in the born - infeld action , say , a tachyon condensate to correct the situation .",

    "the numerical results for a specific choice of parameters is shown in fig .",
    "in contrast to the ` quintessential inflation ' based upon the gravitational particle production mechanism where the scalar field spends long time in the kinetic regime and makes deep undershoot followed by long locking period with very brief tracking , the scalar field in the present scenario tracks the background for a very long time ( see figure [ bden ] ) .",

    "it appears that the tensor perturbations are not adequately suppressed in the models of steep brane world inflation and as a result these models are on the verge of being ruled out . as indicated by lidsey and nunes , inflation in a gauss - bonnet braneworld could appear to be in better agreement with observations than inflation in a rs ii scenario @xcite . in the following section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the prospects of brane world inflation with the gauss - bonnet correction term in the bulk .",
    "though we are trying to motivate the gb term in the bulk having a specific application in mind , the gauss - bonnet correction is interesting in its own right and has a deep meaning .",
    "let us begin at the very beginning and ask for the compelling physical motivation for general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "it is the interaction of zero mass particle with gravitation .",
    "zero mass particle has the universal constant speed which can not change yet it must feel gravity . this can only happen if gravitational field curves space .",
    "since space and time are already bound together by incorporation of zero mass particle in mechanics , gravitational field thus curves spacetime .",
    "in other words it can truly be described by curvature of spacetime and it thus becomes a property of spacetime - no longer an external field @xcite    from the physical standpoint the new feature that gr has to incorporate is that gravitational field itself has energy and hence like any other energy it must also link to gravity .",
    "that is , field has gravitational charge and hence it is self interacting .",
    "field energy density will go as square of first derivative of the metric and it must be included in the einstein field equation .",
    "it is indeed included for the riemann curvature involves the second derivative and square of the first derivative .",
    "however in the specific case of field of an isolated body , we obtain @xmath154 potential , the same as in the newtonian case .",
    "where has the square of @xmath155 ( @xmath156 denotes the gravitational potential ) gone ?",
    "it turns out that its contribution has gone into curving the space , @xmath157 component of the metric being different from @xmath158 .",
    "the main point is that gravitational field equation should follow from the curvature of spacetime and they should be second order quasilinear differential equations ( quasilinear means the highest order of derivative must occur linearly so that the equation admits a unique solution ) .",
    "riemann curvature through the bianchi identities leads to the einstein equation with the @xmath159 term .",
    "we should emphasize here that @xmath159 enters here as naturally as the stress energy tensor .",
    "it is indeed a true new constant of the einsteinian gravity @xcite .",
    "it is a pertinent question to ask , is this the most general second order quasilinear equation one can obtain from curvature of spacetime ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "there exists a remarkable combination of square of riemann tensor and its contractions , which when added to the action gives a second order quasilinear equation involving second and fourth power of the first derivative .",
    "this is what is the famous gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term .",
    "thus gb term too appears naturally and should have some non - trivial meaning .",
    "however gb term is topological in @xmath160 and hence has no dynamics .",
    "it attains dynamics in @xmath161 .",
    "note that gravity does not have its full dynamics in @xmath162 and hence the minimum number of dimensions required for complete description of gravitation is @xmath163 .",
    "this self interaction of gravity arises through square of first derivative of the metric .",
    "self interaction should however be iterative and hence higher order terms should also be included .",
    "it turns out that there exists generalization of the gb term in higher dimensions in terms of the lovelock lagrangian which is a polynomial in the riemann curvature . that again yields the quasilinear second order equation with higher powers of the first derivative .",
    "thus gb and lovelock lagrangian represent higher order loop corrections to the einstein gravity .",
    "they do however make non - trivial contribution classically only for @xmath161 dimensions .",
    "this is rather important .",
    "if gb term had made a non - trivial contribution in @xmath163-dimensions , it would have conflicted with the @xmath154 character of the potential because of the presence of @xmath164 terms in the equation . the square terms ( to account for contribution of gravitational field energy ) were taken care of by the space curvature ( @xmath157 in the metric ) and now nothing more is left to accommodate the fourth ( and higher ) power term .",
    "however we can not tamper with the inverse square law ( i.e. @xmath154 potential ) which is independently required by the gauss law of conservation of flux . that can not be defied at any cost .",
    "thus it is not for nothing that the gb and its lovelock generalization term makes no contribution for @xmath165 .",
    "it further carries an important message that gravitational field can not be kept confined to @xmath163-dimensions .",
    "it is indeed a higher dimensional interaction where the higher order iterations attain meaning and dynamics .",
    "this is the most profound message the gb term indicates .",
    "this is yet another independent and new motivation for higher dimensional gravity @xcite .",
    "self interaction is always to be evaluated iteratively . for gravity iteration",
    "is on the curvature of spacetime .",
    "it is then not surprising that gb term arises naturally from the one loop correction to classical gravity .",
    "string theory should however encompass whatever is obtained by iterative the iterative process .",
    "gb term is therefore strongly motivated by string theoretic considerations as well .",
    "further gb is topological in @xmath163-d but in quantum considerations it defines new vacuum state .",
    "it is quantum mechanically non - trivial . in higher dimensions",
    ", it attains dynamics even at classical level . in the simplest case in higher dimension",
    "it should have a classical analogue of @xmath163-d quantum case .",
    "that is what indeed happens .",
    "space of constant curvature or equivalently conformally flat einstein space solves the equation with gb term with redefined vacuum .",
    "this is a general result for all @xmath161 .",
    "it is interesting to see quantum in lower dimension becoming classical in higher dimension .    in the context of the brane bulk system",
    "we should therefore include gb term in the bulk and see its effects on the dynamics on the brane .",
    "the brane world gravity should thus be studied with gb term not necessarily as correction but in its own right .",
    "it is a true description of high energy gravity .",
    "however , for the purpose of following discussion , we shall treat gb as a correction term .",
    "the einstein - gauss - bonnet action for five dimensional bulk containg a 4d brane is @xmath166 @xmath167 refer to the ricci scalars in the bulk metric @xmath168 and the induced metric on the brane @xmath169 ; @xmath170 has dimensions of ( _ length_)@xmath171 and is the gauss - bonnet coupling , while @xmath3 is the brane tension and @xmath172 is the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "the constant @xmath173 contains the @xmath174 , the 5d fundamental energy scale ( @xmath175 ) . the modified friedman equation on the ( spatially flat ) brane",
    "may be written as  @xcite ( see also ref@xcite ) @xmath176\\,,\\label{mfe}\\\\ \\label{chi } \\kappa_5 ^ 2(\\rho+\\lambda_b ) & = & \\left[{{2(1 - 4\\alpha_{\\rm gb}\\mu^2)^3 } \\over { \\alpha}_{\\rm gb } } \\right]^{1/2 } \\sinh\\chi\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is a dimensionless measure of the energy - density . in order to regain general relativity at low energies ,",
    "the effective 4d newton constant is defined by  @xcite @xmath177 when @xmath178 , we recover the rs expression",
    ". we can fine - tune the brane tension to achieve zero cosmological constant on the brane  @xcite : @xmath179.\\ ] ] the modified friedman equation  ( [ mfe ] ) , together with eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) , shows that there is a characteristic gb energy scale @xmath180@xcite such that , @xmath181^{2/3}\\,,\\label{vhe}\\\\ m_{\\rm gb}^4 \\gg \\rho\\gg\\lambda_b~ & \\rightarrow & ~ h^2\\approx { \\kappa_4 ^ 2 \\over 6\\lambda_b}\\ , \\rho^{2}\\,,\\label{he}\\\\ \\rho\\ll\\lambda_b~ & \\rightarrow & ~ h^2\\approx { \\kappa_4 ^ 2 \\over 3}\\ , \\rho\\ , .",
    "\\label{gr }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it should be noted that hubble law acquires an unusual form for energies higher that than the gb scale .",
    "interestingly , for an exponential potential , the modified eq.([vhe ] ) leads to exactly scale invariant spectrum for primordial density perturbations .",
    "inflation continues below gb scale and terminates in the rs regime leading to the spectral index very close to one .",
    "this is amazing that it happens without tuning the slope of the potential .",
    "the gauss - bonnet inflation has interesting consequences for steep brane world inflation ( see fig .",
    "[ exponential.ps ] and the discussion in the next section ) .",
    "in this paper we have reviewed the recent work on unification of inflation with quintessence in the frame work of brane worlds .",
    "these models belong to the class of _ non - oscillatory _ models in which the underlying alternative reheating mechanism plays a crucial role .",
    "the popular reheating alternative via quantum mechanical production of particle during inflation leads to an unacceptable relic gravity wave background which violates the nucleo - synthesis constraint at the commencement of radiative regime .",
    "we have mentioned other alternatives to conventional ( p)reheating and have shown that instant preheating discovered by felder , linde and kofman is superior and best suited to brane world models of quintessential inflation .",
    "the recent measurement of cmb anisotropies by wmap , appears to heavily constraint these models .",
    "the steep brane world inflation seems to be excluded by observation in rs scenario@xcite .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , the inclusion of gb term in the bulk effects the constraints on the inflationary potentials and can rescue the steep exponential potential allowing it to be compatible with observations for a range of energy scales .",
    "the gb term leads to an increase of the spectral index @xmath182 and decrease of tensor to scalar ratio of perturbations @xmath183 in the intermediate region between rs and gb . as seen from fig.[exponential.ps ] , there is an intermediate region where the steep inflation driven by exponential potential lies within @xmath184 contour for @xmath185 .",
    "thus , the steep inflation in a gauss - bonnet braneworld appears to be in agreement with observations .",
