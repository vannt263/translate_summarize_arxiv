    "in the feature classification domain , the choice of data affects widely the results . for the hyperspectral image",
    ", the bands do nt all contain the information ; some bands are irrelevant like those affected by various atmospheric effects , see figure.4 , and decrease the classification accuracy . and there exist redundant bands to complicate the learning system and product incorrect prediction [ 14 ] .",
    "even the bands contain enough information about the scene they may ca nt predict the classes correctly if the dimension of space images , see figure.3 , is so large that needs many cases to detect the relationship between the bands and the scene ( hughes phenomenon ) [ 10 ] .",
    "we can reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral images by selecting only the relevant bands ( feature selection or subset selection methodology ) , or extracting , from the original bands , new bands containing the maximal information about the classes , using any functions , logical or numerical ( feature extraction methodology ) [ 11][9 ] . here",
    "we focus on the feature selection using mutual information .",
    "hyperspectral images have three advantages regarding the multispectral images [ 6 ] , + _ * assertion : * when we reduce hyperspectral images dimensionality , any method used must save the precision and high discrimination of substances given by hyperspectral image . _",
    "in this paper we use the hyperspectral image aviris 92av3c ( airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer ) . [",
    "it contains 220 images taken on the region ",
    "indiana pine  at  north - western indiana  , usa [ 1 ] .",
    "the 220 called bands are taken between 0.4 m and 2.5 m .",
    "each band has 145 lines and 145 columns .",
    "the ground truth map is also provided , but only 10366 pixels are labeled fro 1 to 16 .",
    "each label indicates one from 16 classes .",
    "the zeros indicate pixels how are not classified yet , figure.2 .",
    "+ the hyperspectral image aviris 92av3c contains numbers between 955 and 9406 .",
    "each pixel of the ground truth map has a set of 220 numbers ( measures ) along the hyperspectral image .",
    "this numbers ( measures ) represent the reflectance of the pixel in each band .",
    "so the pixel is shown as vector off 220 components .",
    "figure .3 .",
    "the hyperspectral image aviris 92av3c contains numbers between 955 and 9406 .",
    "each pixel of the ground truth map has a set of 220 numbers ( measures ) along the hyperspectral image .",
    "this numbers ( measures ) represent the reflectance of the pixel in each band .",
    "so the pixel is shown as vector off 220 components .",
    "+ figure.3 shows the vector pixel s notion [ 7 ] .",
    "so reducing dimensionality means selecting only the dimensions caring a lot of information regarding the classes .",
    "we can also note that not all classes are carrier of information . in figure .",
    "4 , for example , we can show the effects of atmospheric affects on bands : 155 , 220 and other bands .",
    "this hyperspectral image presents the problematic of dimensionality reduction .",
    "this is a measure of exchanged information between tow ensembles of random variables a and b : @xmath0 considering the ground truth map , and bands as ensembles of random variables , we calculate their interdependence .",
    "+ geo [ 3 ] uses also the average of bands 170 to 210 , to product an estimated ground truth map , and use it instead of the real truth map .",
    "their curves are similar .",
    "this is shown at figure 4 .",
    "fano [ 14 ] has demonstrated that as soon as mutual information of already selected feature has high value , the error probability of classification is decreasing , according to the formula bellow : @xmath1with : @xmath2 and : @xmath3    the expression of conditional entropy _",
    "h(c / x ) _ is calculated between the ground truth map ( i.e. the classes c ) and the subset of bands candidates x. nc is the number of classes .",
    "so when the features x have a higher value of mutual information with the ground truth map , ( is more near to the ground truth map ) , the error probability will be lower .",
    "but it s difficult to compute this conjoint mutual information _",
    "i(c;x ) _ , regarding the high dimensionality [ 14].this propriety makes mutual information a good criterion to measure resemblance between too bands , like it s exploited in section ii . furthermore , we will interest at case of one feature candidate x.    _ * corollary : for one feature x , as x approaches the ground truth map , the interval _ _",
    "p__@xmath4 is very small . * _",
    "our idea is based on this observation : the band that has higher value of mutual information with the ground truth map can be a good approximation of it .",
    "so we note that the subset of selected bands are the good ones , if thy can generate an estimated reference map , sensibly equal the ground truth map .",
    "it s clearly that s an incremental wrapper - based subset selection ( iwss ) approach[16 ] [ 13 ]",
    ".    our process of band selection will be as following : we order the bands according to value of its mutual information with the ground truth map .",
    "then we initialize the selected bands ensemble with the band that has highest value of mi . at a point of process",
    ", we build an approximated reference map _ _ c__@xmath5 with the already selected bands , and we put it instead of @xmath6 for computing the error probability ( _ _ p__@xmath4 ) ; the latest band added ( at those already selected ) must make _ _ p__@xmath4 decreasing , if else it will be discarded from the ensemble retained .",
    "then we introduce a complementary threshold _ _ t__@xmath7 to control redundancy .",
    "so the band to be selected must make error probability less than ( _ _ p__@xmath4 - _ _",
    "t__@xmath7 ) , where _ _ p__@xmath4 is calculated before adding it .",
    "the algorithm following shows more detail of the process : + _ let ss be the ensemble of bands already selected and s the band candidate to be selected . _",
    "_ build__@xmath8 is a procedure to construct the estimated reference map . _",
    "_ p__@xmath4 is initialized with a value _ _ p__@xmath9 .",
    "x the number of bands to be selected , @xmath10 is empty and @xmath11 . _    select _ _ band index__@xmath12 @xmath13=__argmax__@xmath12 mi(s ) @xmath14 and @xmath15 _ _ c__@xmath5= _ _",

    "we apply this algorithm on the hyperspectral image aviris 92av3c [ 1 ] , 50% of the labeled pixels are randomly chosen and used in training ; and the other 50% are used for testing classifcation [ 3 ] .",
    "the classifer used is the svm [ 5 ] [ 12 ] [ 4 ] .",
    "+ _ the procedure to construct the estimated reference map _ _ c__@xmath5 is the same svm classifier used for classification .",
    "so _ _ c__@xmath5 is the output of classification .",
    "_      table .",
    "i shows the results obtained for several thresholds .",
    "we can see the effectiveness selection bands of our algorithm , and the important effect of avoiding redundancy .",
    ".results illustrate elimination of redundancy using algorithm based on inequality of fano , for thresholds ( @xmath20 ) [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      +   + * comments : * + * * first : * * we can not the effectiveness of this algorithm for particularly the classes with a few number of pixels , for example class number 9",
    ". + * second : * we can not that 18 bands ( i.e. threshold 0.03 ) are sufficient to detect materials contained in the region .",
    "it s also shown in figure .6 + * tired : * one of important comment is that most of class accuracy change lately when the threshold changes between 0.03 and 0.015",
    "in this paper we presented the necessity to reduce the number of bands , in classification of hyperspectral images .",
    "then we have introduce the mutual information based scheme .",
    "we carried out their effectiveness to select bands able to classify the pixels of ground truth .",
    "we introduce an algorithm also based on mutual information and using a measure of error probability ( inequality of fano ) . to choice a band",
    ", it must contributes to reduce error probability .",
    "a complementary threshold is added to avoid redundancy .",
    "so each band retained has to contribute to reduce error probability by a step equal to threshold even if it caries a redundant information .",
    "we can tell that we conserve the useful redundancy by adjusting the complementary threshold .",
    "the process introduced is able to select the good bands to classification for also the classes that have a few number of pixels .",
    "this algorithm is a feature selection methodology .",
    "but it s a wrapper approach , because we use the classifier to make the estimated reference map .",
    "this is expenssive than filter strategy , but it can be used for application that need more precision .",
    "this scheme is very interesting to investigate and improve , considering its performance .",
