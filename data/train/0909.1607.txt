    "1a  1744@xmath0361  is a neutron star low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) discovered by the _",
    "ariel v _ satellite @xcite .",
    "this source is a transient lmxb , and several outbursts have been observed with a number of missions , most notably the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) . in 2001",
    "@xcite discovered a burst from the direction of 1a  1744@xmath0361 , however , it could not be unambiguously identified as a thermonuclear burst .",
    "the first thermonuclear ( type i ) burst from 1a  1744@xmath0361  was discovered by @xcite using _",
    "rxte_. this type i x - ray burst exhibited a 530-hz burst oscillation which provided a measurement of the neutron star s spin frequency .",
    "the burst also provided an upper limit of @xmath10  kpc , under the assumption that its maximum luminosity could not exceed the eddington luminosity for a 1.4-@xmath11 neutron star @xcite .",
    "this source also shows regular incidents of intensity `` dips '' in its x - ray emission . according to @xcite ,",
    "such dips are produced by obscuring material associated with a structured accretion disk .",
    "dips would only be visible for inclination angles 60@xmath12@xmath1380@xmath12 @xcite . in principle dips",
    "could occur every orbital cycle , however , because of variations in the obscuring material in the disk , the presence of dips often varies from cycle to cycle and from source to source .",
    "the dips observed in 1a  1744@xmath0361 , as is the case for other dipping lmxbs , exhibit complex structure ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  4 ) .",
    "by measuring the spacing between two closely spaced dip episodes observed by _",
    "rxte _ , @xcite estimated the orbital period of 1a  1744@xmath0361  to be @xmath1497 minutes , however these dip episodes were separated by a data gap , thus not precluding shorter orbital periods .",
    "narrow absorption features have been seen in the persistent emission of many `` dipping '' lmxbs .",
    "for example , xb  1916@xmath0053  @xcite , x  1624@xmath0490 @xcite , 4u  1323@xmath062  @xcite . by far ,",
    "the most prominent features are the ( he - like ) and ( h - like ) lines . the ubiquity of narrow features in dipping lmxbs suggests that they are a property of all lmxbs , but are seen predominately in dipping lmxbs because their particular geometry is optimal for viewing them @xcite .",
    "these features allow one to probe the structure , dynamics , and evolution of the material surrounding the neutron star .",
    "thus , the spectral properties of 1a  1744@xmath0361  are of great interest . using _ rxte _",
    "data , @xcite found that the persistent spectrum of this source is well modeled by a comptonized blackbody model @xcite , and they also found evidence of a broad ( @xmath140.6  kev ) iron emission feature at @xmath146  kev and an iron absorption edge at @xmath148  kev .",
    "_ rxte _  is not sensitive to narrow spectral features given its coarse spectral resolution and large fov , thus , during the july 2008 outburst of this source we triggered _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( _ cxo _ ) target - of - opportunity observations for this purpose .    in   [ sec :",

    "during 1a  1744@xmath0361 s last outburst in july 2008 , we triggered three _",
    "cxo _  too observations .",
    "these observations are summarized in table  [ ta : cxo obs ] . in order to search for narrow absorption features such as those seen in other dipping lmxbs",
    "the data were taken with the high - energy transmission grating ( hetg * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard _",
    "cxo_. the hetg consists of two arms , the high energy grating ( heg ) and the medium energy grating ( meg ) .",
    "the heg is sensitive to photons in the 0.8@xmath010  kev band with a resolving power of @xmath15@xmath141000 at 1  kev , and the meg is sensitive to photons in the 0.4@xmath05.0  kev band with a resolving power of 660 at 0.8  kev .",
    "the gratings were operated with acis which enables separation of the individual diffraction orders , @xmath16 , and a nondispersed zeroth order image is also obtained .",
    "we inspected all dispersed orders , however , for our analysis we concentrated on the @xmath17 data because its effective area is more than an order of magnitude greater than the other orders for both the meg and the heg .",
    "data in the different orders can be combined , however they have different spectral and spatial responses and thus we avoided doing so , lest we smear out any narrow features .",
