    "carbon chains molecules are of special interest for astrophysics since douglas ( 1977 ) proposed them as possible carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) . in the past years , many polar carbon chains have been detected in the interstellar and circumstellar media ( ism and csm ) through their pure rotational spectrum at radio wavelengths .",
    "major examples are the cyanopolyynes , hc@xmath11n with @xmath12=15 ( turner 1971 , avery et al .",
    "1976 , kroto et al . 1978 ,",
    "broten et al .",
    "1978 , bell et al . 1997 ) , and the hydrogenated carbon chain radicals such as c@xmath9h , c@xmath8h , c@xmath13h and c@xmath14h ( cernicharo et al .",
    "1986 , gulin et al .",
    "1987 , 1997 , cernicharo & gulin 1996 ) .    on the other hand , larger carbon molecular complexes such as the polyatomic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are believed to dominate the ubiquitous mid  ir emission seen in the unidentified infrared bands ( uibs ) .",
    "however , only the single aromatic species , benzene , has been so far identified through its ir active modes ( cernicharo et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "all this chemistry richness suggests that the growth mechanisms producing complex carbon molecules such as the pahs or the fullerenes are highly efficient . nevertheless , the set of ` building blocks' and the possible chemical reactions still have to be identified and clarified . among the possible species ,",
    "the pure carbon chains , ( c@xmath15 ; van orden & saykally 1998 ) , could be the ` skeletons' from which larger organic molecules can be formed ( see cernicharo , goicoechea & caux 2000 , cernicharo 2004 ) . due to the lack of permanent electric dipole ,",
    "these species do not have rotational spectrum to be observed from radio telescopes . the only way to detect them in the dense ism and csm is through their asymmetrical stretching modes around @xmath05  @xmath1 m ( 2000  @xmath2 ) and/or through their low  energy bending modes around @xmath0100  @xmath1 m ( @xmath0100  @xmath2 ) .",
    "the first technique allowed the detection of c@xmath16 ( hinkle et al .",
    "1988 ) and c@xmath9 ( bernath et al . 1989 ) in the circumstellar envelope of the bright ir evolved star irc+10216 .",
    "however , few sources ( specially in the ism ) have enough flux at @xmath05  @xmath1 m to allow systematic studies of the c@xmath15 stretching modes , and the less known far ",
    "ir bending modes are the only way to detect these species .    before the launch of iso ( kessler et al .",

    "in addition , we have detected several unidentified far - ir bands ( ufibs ) in the iso spectrum of many c  rich sources that may also be related with the bending modes of carbon chains species .",

    "ngc  7027 is one of the most studied evolved objects in the galaxy .",
    "it is a young pne , @xmath01000  years since it left the agb stage , characterized by a relatively compact ionized region ( volk & kwok 1997 ) driven by the radiation that arises from a central source at @xmath0200,000  k ( latter et al . 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , a rich @xmath5chemistry is taking place in the larger molecular envelope ( @xmath040@xmath20 in co ; masson et al .",
    "1985 ) that surrounds the inner photon dominated regions .",
    "in fact , ngc  7027 was the first object to show uib emission latter attributed to the pah emission ( gillett et al . 1973 ) and the only source where pure rotational lines of ch@xmath21 have been detected ( cernicharo et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "therefore , the detection of unidentified features in the ir spectrum of ngc  7027 has historically contributed to a better understanding of the interstellar carbon complexity . in this work ,",

    "many carbon chains ( polar and non - polar ) possess prominent ir active stretching modes in this wavelength range",

    "1997 ) , and thus , no more @xmath28-bearing species are contaminating the @xmath086110  @xmath1 m window .    due to the presence of an hii region in the inner envelope , we have also searched for all the possible atomic transitions that could arise from the nebular gas .",
    "the most likely atomic lines in a pne such as ngc  7027 ( fine structure and recombination lines ) , taken from the _ atomic line list _ by peter van hoof have been analyzed .",
    "we note that lines from [ viv ] , [ viii ] and [ tiiii ] , with transitions in the considered wavelength range , have been previously detected in the optical spectrum of ngc  7027 ( baluteau et al .",

    "however , none of these lines appear between 90 and 110  @xmath1 m . in addition , we have analyzed the possible overlapping with fine structure lines .",
    "in particular , the [ tiii]96.68 , 106.27 and [ vii]97.79  @xmath1 m lines could produce some emission in the considered range . even assuming a vanadium abundance 10 times larger than the solar abundance",
    ", the [ vii]97.79  @xmath1 m ( @xmath33d@xmath16-@xmath33d@xmath34 ) line would be extremely weak .",
    "note that the [ vii]141.68  @xmath1 m ( @xmath33d@xmath34-@xmath33d@xmath35 ) line is neither detected in ngc  7027 . finally , the solar abundance of ti is @xmath010 times that of vanadium .",
    "we also computed that is too low to produce significant emission in the [ tiii]96.68 , 106.27 lines .",
    "hence , the integrated band intensity and the different lines or sub - bands could not be fully assigned to any of these atomic lines nor to the pure rotational lines with significant line strength arising from the light species in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "we also note that after subtracting the crowed emission of co , hcn and hcn@xmath36 ( pure rotational lines in vibrational excited states ) from the spectrum of irc+10216 , some of the remaining peaks also agreed with those unidentified peaks observed in ngc  7027 ( see fig .",
    "however , the spectral resolution is too poor to distinguish unidentified features from the forest of hcn@xmath36 rotational lines that contaminate the far  ir spectrum of irc+10216 but are missing in ngc  7027 .",
    "the hcn abundance in irc+10216 is very high , @xmath03@xmath3710@xmath38 , with hcn / co=1/10 .",
    "in fact , hcn is the main coolant of this @xmath5rich agb star ( cernicharo et al .",
    "however , the molecule is photodissociated during the post  agb evolution as the uv radiation field from the evolving star increases . from far",

    "pne crl  2688 and crl  618 respectively .",
    "the extreme case is ngc  7027 , were a great part of hcn molecules must have been photodissociatd in cn and h. in fact , bachiller et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found cn / hcn@xmath010 for this object .",
    "thus , the low abundance of hcn compared to irc+10216 is consistent with the non detection of far  ir hcn lines ( herpin et al .",
    "pure rotational lines of other cyanopolyynes species such as hc@xmath16n can not produce emission in this range because of the high energy levels associated with its far  ir transitions .    taking into account",
    "the high s / n ratio of the ngc  7027 spectrum , and the absence of the band in sources such as orion , sgr  a or @xmath28rich evolved stars , we believe that the lines are real . due to the chemistry of ngc  7027 , the most probable carrier should be the low  energy bending mode of a polyatomic molecule containing carbon .",
    "both pahs and pure carbon chains possesses low  energy bending modes in the far  ir .",
    "contrary to the uib emission in the mid  ir , the far  ir skeletal modes of pahs ( vibrations associated with the bending of the skeletal structure ) depends of the exact nature of the species .",
    "hence , the rovibrational structure of the pah skeletal mode has to be calculated for each specific pah . as a example",
    ", the lowest energy active mode of coronene ( c@xmath39h@xmath40 ) lies at @xmath0127  @xmath2 ( joblin et al .",

    "the far - ir emission of a few pahs has also been observed in gas phase experiments ( zhang et al .",
    "however , if one of the observed ufibs belongs to a specific pahs , other bands ( generally stronger ) should be observed in the ir spectrum .",
    "this is not the case of the new ufib presented in this work and we have considered the low  energy modes of pure carbon chains as possible carriers of the observed ufib .    the detection of several rovibrational lines of the @xmath17 bending mode of c@xmath16 ( @xmath063  @xmath2 ) in sgr  b2 and irc+10216 evidenced high abundances for this species and opened the possibility to detect more carbon chains in the ism and csm ( cernicharo et al .",
    "2000 ) . at the low resolution of the lws / grating ,",
    "the more intense c@xmath16 lines [ q(2,4,6 ) ] are blended with the strong [ cii]158  @xmath1 m line and no assignation could be made in ngc  7027 .",
    "however , the tentative detection of the @xmath18 bending mode of c@xmath19 in many objects including ngc  7027 ( @xmath0174  @xmath2 ; cernicharo et al .",
    "2002 ) , if confirmed , will imply a c@xmath16/c@xmath19@xmath4310 abundance ratio , which will suggest that the abundance of c@xmath15 does not decrease drastically when @xmath12 increases .    in spite of their importance , the c@xmath15 bending modes are difficult to characterize spectroscopically in the laboratory or by _ ab initio _ computations .",
    "as expected , the main uncertainties difficulting their astronomical detection are the band origin and the ir intensity .",
    "moreover , the induced dipole moments and other spectroscopic constants are often known for the fundamental transition but less or nothing is known about overtone transitions within the bending mode or transitions to other excited states including the stretching modes .",
    "the ground electronic state is different for the odd and even numbered cumulenic chains .",
    "this property determines the observed band shape of the bending mode .",
    "numbered linear c@xmath15 s have a singlet @xmath44 ground electronic state which results in a perpendicular @xmath45 vibronic spectrum with a strong @xmath46 branch and weak @xmath47 and @xmath48 branches . on the other hand ,",
    "even  numbered linear c@xmath15 s have a triplet @xmath49 ground electronic state .",
    "hence , each rotational line is split in three components due to spin couplings .",
    "this splitting increase with the number of atoms but is particularly small for c@xmath19 and c@xmath8 ( giesen et al .",
    "the vibronic transition is now @xmath50 , and despite the null component of the electronic orbital momentum in the ground state , the spin  orbit constant ( a@xmath51 ) could be large in even c@xmath15 s .",
