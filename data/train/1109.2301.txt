    "the theoretical description of time - dependent transport in semiconductor nanostructures has received considerable attention in the last few years .",
    "non - equilibrium greens function techniques and density - functional methods were developed for transient current calculations in interacting and non - interacting structures ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these methods were employed to study the response of a mesoscopic sample to a time - dependent ( possibly pulsed ) voltage applied on the leads and/or to check the expected crossover to a steady - state .",
    "a strong motivation behind these studies is the need to model and predict the transient response of open and interacting nanodevices subjected to time - dependent signals . since in real systems both the contacts and sample geometry as well as",
    "the charging and correlation effects are important , the numerical implementation of the various formal methods requires extensive and costly computational work .",
    "recently we reported transport calculations for a two - dimensional parabolic quantum wire in the turnstile setup @xcite , where the coulomb interaction between electrons was neglected .",
    "the wire was in contact with external leads , seen as particle reservoirs , and the contact regions were described by a phenomenological ansatz .",
    "we provided a careful analysis of the electronic propagation on the edge states that develop in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "let us remind here that the turnstile setup was experimentally realized by kouwenhoven _",
    "it essentially involves a time - dependent modulation ( pumping ) of the tunneling barriers between the finite sample and drain and source leads , respectively . during the first half of the pumping cycle the system opens only to the source lead whereas during the second half of the cycle the drain contact opens . at certain parameters",
    "an integer number of electrons is transferred across the sample in a complete cycle .",
    "similar transient current measurements were performed in a pump - and - probe configuration @xcite .",
    "more complex turnstile pumps have been studied by numerical simulations , like one - dimensional arrays of junctions @xcite or two - dimensional multidot systems @xcite .",
    "the turnstile regime differs from the adiabatic quantum pumping where charge is transferred along a sample even in the absence of a bias .    in this paper",
    "we describe the turnstile regime of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum wire ( `` the sample '' ) .",
    "the effect of the electron - electron interaction is included in the sample via the exact diagonalization method while the time - dependent transport is performed within the generalized master equation ( gme ) formalism as it is described in ref .",
    "the implemented gme formalism can be used to describe both the initial transient regime immediately after the coupling of the leads to the sample and the evolution towards a steady state achieved in the long time limit . to the best of our knowledge",
    "these are the first numerical simulations of electronic transport through a coulomb interacting and spatially extended quantum turnstile .",
    "we discuss for the first time the effect of contacts location on the transient currents .",
    "more precisely , we show that if the drain lead is attached to different regions of the quantum wire the currents in both leads are considerably affected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model and the methodology are described in section  [ sec : model ] , the numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , and the conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the physical system consists in a sample connected to two leads acting as particle reservoirs . we shall adopt a tight - binding description of the system :",
    "the sample is a 10-site quantum wire and the leads are 1d and semi - infinite .",

    "the left lead ( or the source , marked as @xmath0 ) is contacted at one end of the sample and the right lead ( or the drain , marked as @xmath1 ) may be contacted on any other site .",
    "the hamiltonian of the coupled and electrically biased system reads as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian of the isolated sample , including the electron - electron interaction , and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , corresponds to the left and the right leads .",
    "@xmath6 describes the time - dependent coupling between the single - particle basis states @xmath7 of the leads : @xmath8 the function @xmath9 describes the time - dependent switching of the sample - lead contacts , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 create / annihilate electrons in the corresponding single - particle states of the sample or leads , respectively .",
    "the coupling coefficient @xmath12 involves the two eigenfunctions evaluated at the contact sites @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the site of the lead @xmath15 and @xmath16 the site in the sample @xcite . in our present calculations we keep the left lead connected to the site @xmath17 , while the position of the right lead is @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 plays the role of a coupling constant between the sample and the leads .     given in eq .",

    "for a sufficiently weak coupling strength ( @xmath20 ) one obtains the non - markovian integro - differential master equation for the rdo : @xmath25-\\frac{1}{\\hbar^2}\\sum_{\\ell}\\int { \\mathrm{d}}q\\:\\chi_{\\ell}(t ) ( [ { \\cal t}_{q\\ell},\\omega_{q\\ell}(t)]+h.c . ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined as @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the fermi function of the lead @xmath15 .",
    "the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 describe the transitions between two many - electron states ( mes ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 when one electron enters the sample or leaves it : @xmath34 the gme is solved numerically by calculating the matrix elements of the rdo in the basis of the interacting mes , in small time steps , following a crank - nicolson algorithm . using the rdo we obtain the time dependent charge and currents in the system .",
    "more details can be found in ref.@xcite .",

    "the interacting mes are calculated in the fock space as superpositions of non - interacting mes derived from slater determinants @xcite . since the sample is open the number of electrons",
    "is not fixed , but the coulomb interaction conserves the number of electrons . with 10 lattice sites",
    "we obtain 10 single - particle eigenstates and thus @xmath35 elements in the fock space spanned by the occupation numbers .",

    "[ fig : charge ] we show the evolution of the total charge in the system for the two contact configurations mentioned above and the narrower bias window .",
    "the modulating signals impose charge oscillations , which after some time become periodic . due to the choice of the bias window",

    "single particle states are practically unpopulated and inactive in this case .",
    "we see that the charge accumulated in the sample feels the different placements of the right lead .",
    "indeed , when the drain lead is coupled to the site 3 the oscillations of the total charge diminish compared to the case when the drain is on site 10 .",
    "one can say that part of the charge located beyond the right contact , i.  e.  between sites 3 and 10 , is somehow frozen and does not contribute to transport .",

    "one can notice some differences in the current oscillations between the two placements of the right contacts , on site 10 and on site 3 , respectively .",
    "more and sharper oscillations of the currents occur in the later case , but still one can say that qualitatively the currents look similar in the two cases .",

    "the current profiles for the two placements of the right contact are qualitatively different . with the right lead on site 10",
    "we obtain positive currents in both leads , describing charge flow in the direction imposed by the the bias , i.  e.  from the left to the right of the system .",
    "moreover , the current in the left leads partially resembles the pulse shape .",
    "but for the other placement , i.  e.  with the right contact at site 3 , we see much stronger oscillations , and even negative currents in both leads for short times .",
    "these negative currents are actually _ against _ the bias . in spite on their rather small amplitude",
    "one should note that these negative currents do not vanish in the long time limit , that is when the evolution of the system is periodic in time .",
    "another particular feature of the asymmetric contact geometry is that it leads to pronounced spikes in the left lead current .",
    "we then increase the bias window and obtain the results shown in fig.[fig : crt : large_bias ] .",
    "the current pulses in the contact placement @xmath77 do not change qualitatively from the previous case of the smaller bias window , but those for the placement @xmath78 do change : the negative currents occur only in the right lead ( the solid line ) , but not in the left lead ( the dashed line ) . in this case",
    "some charge bounces back an forth between the sites 3 and 10 , and enter or exit the sample through the @xmath1 lead , but it does not reach the @xmath0 lead at site 1 . in other words",
    "the placement of the right contact is qualitatively important for the current profiles for a finite bias window .",
    "as we have checked , the negative currents survive for a longer period of the pulses .",
    "it is interesting to compare the current in one lead to the time derivative of the charge , figures  [ fig : crt : small_bias ] and [ fig : charge ] . in the simplest interpretation ,",
    "when the left contact is open and the right contact is closed the charge in the sample increases , and so the left current is positive and the right current is zero . in the next phase , when the left contact closes and the right one opens , the charge decreases , and the right current is positive , the left current being now zero .",
    "the charging or discharging are actually complex processes , because different states are occupied with different time constants , and thus the charging is not constant in time , and the currents have oscillations , more or less following the time derivative of the charge .",
    "the fine structure of the currents is however more complicated , also related to the charge oscillations on the particular site where the contact is attached .",
    "finally , we want to comment on the coulomb effects .",
    "the coulomb interaction which is included in the present calculations has an important role in the charge distribution , through coulomb blocking and correlation effects , and so the currents are also affected .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to compare the results without and with the coulomb interaction included .",
    "if coulomb effects are neglected ( @xmath79 ) the whole energy spectrum changes and new states are present within the bias window . then the chemical potentials in the leads have to be shifted accordingly in order to capture in the bias window states with similar number of electrons as in the interacting case .",
