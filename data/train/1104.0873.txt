    "qcd vacuum is characterized by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and color confinement .",
    "the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is due to a non - vanishing quark anti - quark condensate , @xmath3 in the vacuum , which induces the presence of the light nambu - goldstone particles , the pions and kaons in the hadron spectrum .",
    "the confinement represents that only colorless states are observed in the spectrum , which is commonly described by the linearly rising potential between two heavy quarks at large distances , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the string tension .",
    "it is expected that chiral symmetry can be restored and color degrees of freedom can be freed at high temperature and/or density .",
    "the interplay between chiral and deconfinement phase transitions at finite temperature and density are of continuous interests for studying the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the chiral restoration is characterized by the restoration of chiral symmetry and the deconfinement phase transition is characterized by the breaking of center symmetry , which are only well defined in two extreme quark mass limits , respectively . in the chiral limit when the current quark mass is zero @xmath6 ,",
    "the chiral condensate @xmath7 is the order parameter for the chiral phase transition .",
    "when the current quark mass goes to infinity @xmath8 , qcd becomes pure gauge @xmath9 theory , which is center symmetric in the vacuum , and the usually used order parameter is the polyakov loop expectation value @xmath10 @xcite , which is related to the heavy quark free energy . at zero density and chiral limit , lattice qcd results show that the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions occur at the same critical temperature , e.g , see ref .",
    "@xcite , and also review papers @xcite .",
    "this result is highly nontrivial because these two distinct phase transitions involve different mechanisms at different energy scales .",
    "it has been largely believed for a long time that chiral symmetry restoration always coincides with deconfinement phase transition in the whole @xmath11 plane .",
    "however , for the case of finite physical quark mass , neither the chiral condensate nor the polyakov loop is a good order parameter . for heavy quark",
    ", there is no dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( e.g , see @xcite ) thus no chiral restoration . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear potential description for confinement property is not suitable for light quark system . in recent years",
    ", several lattice groups have made much effort on investigating the chiral and deconfinement phase transition temperatures with almost physical quark masses , e.g , rbc - bielefeld group @xcite , which later merged with part of the milc group @xcite and formed the hotqcd group @xcite , and wuppertal - budapest group @xcite .",
    "the result from the rbc - bielefeld group in 2006 @xcite found that the two pseudo - critical temperatures for @xmath0 coincide at @xmath12 .",
    "the wuppetal - budapest group found that for the case of @xmath0 , there are three pseudocritical temperatures , the transition temperature for chiral restoration of @xmath1 quarks @xmath13 , the transition temperature for @xmath2 quark number susceptibility @xmath14 and the deconfinement transition temperature @xmath15 from the polyakov loop .",
    "recently , it is shown in @xcite , by using an improved hisq action , hotqcd collaboration results are close to the wuppetal - budapest collaboration results .    the relation between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions has also attracted more interest recently in studying the phase diagram at high baryon density region @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite that in large @xmath16 limit , a confined but chiral symmetric phase , which is called quarkyonic phase can exist in the high baryon density region .",
    "the quarkyonic phase or chiral density wave state is due to the quark - hole pairing near the fermi surface .",
    "nevertheless , it attracts a lot of interests to study whether such a chiral symmetric but confined phase can survive in real qcd phase diagram , and how it competes with nuclear matter and the color superconducting phase @xcite .    in the framework of qcd effective models",
    ", there is still no dynamical model which can describe the chiral symmetry breaking and confinement simultaneously .",
    "the main difficulty of effective qcd model to include confinement mechanism lies in that it is difficult to calculate the polyakov loop analytically .",
    "currently , the popular models used to investigate the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions are the polyakov nambu - jona - lasinio model ( pnjl ) @xcite and polyakov linear sigma model ( plsm ) @xcite .",
    "however , the shortcoming of these models is that the temperature dependence of the polyakov - loop potential is put in by hand from lattice result , which can not be self - consistently extended to finite baryon density .",
    "recently , efforts have been made in ref.@xcite to derive a low - energy effective theory for confinement - deconfinement and chiral - symmetry breaking / restoration .",
    "recent investigation revealed that quark propagator , heat kernels can also act as an order parameter as they transform non trivially under the center transformation related to deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "the exciting result is the behavior of spectral sum of the dirac operator under center transformation @xcite .",
    "a new order parameter , called dressed polyakov loop has been defined which can be represented as a spectral sum of the dirac operator @xcite . it has been found the infrared part of the spectrum particularly plays a leading role in confinement @xcite .",
    "this result is encouraging since it gives a hope to relate the chiral phase transition with the confinement - deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the order parameter for chiral phase transition is related to the spectral density of the dirac operator through banks - casher relation @xcite .",
    "therefore , both the dressed polyakov loop and the chiral condensate are related to the spectral sum of the dirac operator .",
    "behavior of the dressed polyakov loop is mainly studied in the framework of lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "apart from that , studies based on dyson - schwinger equations @xcite and pnjl model @xcite have been carried out . in those studies",
    "the role of dressed polyakov loop as an order parameter is discussed at zero chemical potential .",
    "the dressed polyakov loop at finite temperature and density has been investigated in the two - flavor njl model in ref.@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we show the phase diagram in the framework of three - flavor njl model by using the dressed polyakov loop as an equivalent order parameter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we introduce the dressed polyakov loop as an equivalent order parameter of confinement deconfinement phase transition and the njl model in sec .",
    "[ dpl - section ] .",
    "then in sec.[su3-section ] , we show the results of three - flavor qcd phase diagram in @xmath17 plane in the chiral limit and in the case of explicit chiral symmetry breaking , respectively . at the end",
    ", we give the conclusion and discussion .",
    "we firstly introduce the dressed polyakov loop . to do this we have to consider a @xmath18 valued boundary condition for the fermionic fields in the temporal direction instead of the canonical choice of anti - periodic boundary condition , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the phase angle and @xmath21 is the inverse temperature .",
    "dual quark condensate @xmath22 is then defined by the fourier transform ( w.r.t the phase @xmath23 ) of the general boundary condition dependent quark condensate @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the winding number .",
    "particular case of @xmath26 is called the dressed polyakov loop which transforms in the same way as the conventional thin polyakov loop under the center symmetry and hence is an order parameter for the deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "it reduces to the thin polyakov loop and to the dual of the conventional chiral condensate in infinite and zero quark mass limits respectively , i.e. , in the chiral limit @xmath27 we get the dual of the conventional chiral condensate and in the @xmath8 limit we have thin polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of three - flavor njl model @xcite is given as @xmath28 + { \\rm det}_f[\\bar{\\psi}(1-\\gamma_5)\\psi ]     \\big\\}. \\label{lagr - flavor-3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the transpose of the quark field , and @xmath30 is the corresponding mass matrix in the flavor space . @xmath31 with @xmath32 are the eight gell - mann matrices , and @xmath33 means determinant in flavor space .",
    "the last term is the standard form of the t hooft interaction , which is invariant under @xmath34 symmetry , but breaks down the @xmath35 symmetry .",

    ". we will only consider isospin symmetric quark matter and define a uniform chemical potential @xmath44 for u , d and s.    it is known that the njl model lacks of confinement and the gluon dynamics is encoded in a static coupling constant for four point contact interaction .",
    "however , assuming that we can read the information of confinement from the dual chiral condensate , it would be interesting to see the behavior of the dressed polyakov loop in a scenario without any explicit mechanism for confinement .",
    "the thermodynamic potential contains imaginary part .",
    "we take only the real part of the potential and the imaginary phase factor is not considered in this work . the mean field @xmath45",
    "is obtained by minimizing the potential for each value of @xmath46 for fixed t and @xmath44 .",

    "<S> the chiral condensate and dressed polyakov loop at finite temperature and density have been investigated in the framework of @xmath0 nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with two degenerate @xmath1 quarks and one strange quark . in the case of explicit chiral symmetry breaking with physical quark masses </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the phase transitions for light @xmath1 quarks and @xmath2 quark are sequentially happened , and the separation between the transition lines for different flavors becomes wider and wider with the increase of baryon density . </S>",
    "<S> for each flavor , the pseudo - critical temperatures for chiral condensate and dressed polyakov loop differ in a narrow transition range in the lower baryon density region , and the two transitions coincide in the higher baryon density region . </S>"
