    "with the most recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and large scale structures ( lss ) of the universe as well as various other astronomical observations , it is now possible to have a clear and consistent picture of the history and content of the universe since nucleosynthesis . in particular",
    ", it is well established that the cosmological perturbations which gave rise to the cmb anisotropies and the lss of the universe were inflationary , with a close to scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich spectrum .",
    "moreover , the cmb and lss data allow to test the paradigm of adiabaticity of the cosmological perturbations and hence the precise nature of the mechanism which has generated them .",
    "the simplest realizations of the inflationary paradigm predict an approximately scale invariant spectrum of adiabatic ( ad ) and gaussian curvature fluctuations , whose amplitude remains constant outside the horizon , and therefore allows cosmologists to probe directly the physics of inflation from current cmb and lss observations . however , this is not the only possibility .",
    "models of inflation with more than one field generically predict that , together with the adiabatic component , there should also be entropy , or isocurvature perturbations  @xcite , associated with fluctuations in number density between different components of the plasma before photon decoupling , with a possible statistical correlation between the adiabatic and isocurvature modes  @xcite .",
    "baryon isocurvature ( bi ) perturbations and cold dark matter isocurvature ( cdi ) perturbations were proposed long ago  @xcite as an alternative to adiabatic perturbations .",
    "these bi and cdi modes are qualitatively similar , since they are related by a simple rescaling factor @xmath10 , or @xmath11 for the cross - correlation : thus , by studying the case of mixed ad + cdi modes , one implicitly includes the case of ad + bi , for which the allowed isocurvature fraction is larger roughly by the above factor evaluated near the maximum likelihood model .",
    "a few years ago , two other modes , neutrino isocurvature density ( nid ) and velocity ( niv ) perturbations , have been added to the list  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "isocurvature perturbations have been advocated in order to explain the high redshift of reionization claimed by the wmap team  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that in the case all fields thermalize at reheating , no isocurvature mode will survive @xcite .",
    "the simplest assumption for generating observable cdi perturbations is that one of the inflaton fields remains uncoupled from the rest of the plasma between inflation and its decay into cdm particles .",
    "since baryons and neutrinos are usually assumed to be in thermal equilibrium in the early universe , it is more difficult to build realistic models for the generation of bi , nid and niv modes than for cdi - but some possibilities still exist , based on non - zero conserved quantities and chemical potentials ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is well known that entropy perturbations seed curvature perturbations outside the horizon  @xcite , so that it is possible that a significant component of the observed adiabatic mode could be maximally correlated with an isocurvature mode .",
    "such models are generically called _ curvaton models _",
    "@xcite , and are now widely studied as an alternative to the standard paradigm .",
    "furthermore , isocurvature modes typically induce non - gaussian signatures in the spectrum of primordial perturbations @xcite .    in the last few years",
    ", various models with a correlated mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations have been tested by several authors , with different combinations of data sets and theoretical priors .",
    "a crucial difference between these analyses lies in the assumptions concerning the scale - dependence of the various modes .",
    "some groups assumed for simplicity that the adiabatic and isocurvature mode shared exactly the same scale - dependence @xcite , but enriched the analysis by considering the full mixtures of several modes at a time ( ad , cdi , nid , niv ) .",
    "other groups concentrated on the ( correlated ) mixture of two modes only ( ad+cdi in @xcite , ad+nid and ad+niv in @xcite ) , with a different power law for the three components ( adiabatic , isocurvature and cross - correlation ) , as expected in the general case .",
    "finally , an intermediate approach consists in studying the mixture of two modes with a scale - independent mixing angle , i.e. , only two tilts @xcite .",
    "in addition to these references , some groups studied the case of the curvaton scenario , which requires some specific analyses @xcite since it involves a maximal correlation / anti - correlation and a unique spectral index for the adiabatic and isocurvature modes .",
    "furthermore , two groups have quantified the need for isocurvature modes through a bayesian evidence computation on the basis of current cmb and galaxy power spectrum data , reaching somewhat different conclusions due to a different choice of priors @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we are particularly interested in mixed models with ad+cdi modes and three different tilts , for which it was shown in refs . @xcite and @xcite that a significant fraction of isocurvature perturbations is still allowed .",
    "this sounds surprising at first sight , since the isocurvature mode is known for suppressing small - scale cmb anisotropies .",
    "this is true indeed for a scale - invariant spectrum of primordial isocurvature fluctuations , but not in general : a significant isocurvature contribution with a very blue tilt ( @xmath12 ) can contribute to cmb anistropies even on small scales , and can be compatible to some extent with the cmb temperature and temperature - polarization spectra , in spite of the small shift induced in the scale of the acoustic peaks .",
    "these models predict generically an excess of matter fluctuations on small scales . using the shape and amplitude of the _ linear _ power spectrum derived from galaxy surveys at wavenumbers @xmath13mpc",
    ", one can exclude such an excess for wavelengths @xmath14 larger than @xmath15 mpc .",
    "the main goal of this work is to push the constraints down by making use of lyman-@xmath2 forest data , which probe large - scale structure at redshift @xmath16 and on scales @xmath17 , in the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "therefore , in any comparison between lyman-@xmath2 observations and linear theoretical predictions , it is necessary to take into account the non - linear evolution with n - body or hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "usually , these simulations are carried under the assumption of adiabaticity .",
    "however , it is not difficult to generalize them to the case of mixed adiabatic plus isocurvature models . during matter domination ,",
    "the perturbations seeded by each of the two modes are indistinguishable : the only difference lies in their scale - dependence , but not in their nature or time  evolution .",
    "so , a given mixed model is entirely specified by a single matter transfer function , defined for instance soon after the time of equality .",
    "therefore , the lyman-@xmath2 forest data can be safely applied to non - adiabatic models provided that one takes into account the fact that the matter transfer function has more freedom than in the purely adiabatic case . in the following analysis",
    ", we will carefully take this point into account .",
    "we will use here the linear matter power spectrum inferred from two large samples of quasar ( qso ) absorption spectra @xcite using state  of  the  art hydrodynamical simulations @xcite combined with cosmic microwave background data from the wmap satellite  @xcite ; as well as from the small - scale temperature anisotropy probed by vsa  @xcite , cbi  @xcite and acbar  @xcite ; from the matter power spectrum measured by the 2-degree - field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs )  @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )  @xcite ; and finally from the recent type ia supernova ( sn ) compilation of ref .",
    "we note that the cosmological parameters recovered from the data sets used in this paper are in good agreement with subsequent studies made by the sdss collaboration using a different data set and a very different theoretical modelling ( @xcite ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the analysis of the lyman-@xmath2 forest qso spectra is robust and that many systematic uncertainties involved in the measurement are now better understood than a few years ago .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the notations we used for the isocurvature sector . in section iii",
    "we introduce the lyman-@xmath2 data that we are employing . in section",
    "iv we discuss the general bounds on our full ad+cdi parameter space from lyman-@xmath2 , cmb , lss and sn data using a bayesian likelihood analysis .",
    "we also check explicitly with a hydrodynamical simulation the robustness of our lyman-@xmath2 data - fitting procedure , and we address the subtle issue of the role of parametrizations and priors on the isocurvature bounds and in the interpretations of our results .",
    "we also discuss the specific curvaton models with maximal anticorrelation and equal tilts for both adiabatic and isocurvature modes , as well as bounds on double inflation models . in section",
    "v we draw our conclusions .",
    "for the theoretical analysis , we will use the notation and some of the approximations of ref .  @xcite . during inflation , more than one scalar field could evolve sufficiently slowly that their quantum fluctuations perturbed the metric on scales larger than the hubble scale during inflation .",
    "these perturbations will later give rise to one adiabatic mode and several isocurvature modes .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to the situation where there are only two fields , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and thus only one isocurvature and one adiabatic mode . introducing more fields would complicate the inflationary model and even then , it would be rather unlikely that more than one isocurvature mode contributes to the observed cosmological perturbations .",
    "therefore , the two - point correlation function or power spectra of both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations , as well as their cross - correlation , can be parametrized with three power laws , i.e. three amplitudes and three spectral indices , @xmath20 \\delta_{{\\cal s}}^2(k)\\!&\\equiv&\\ ! { k^3\\over2\\pi^2}\\langle{{\\cal s}}_{\\rm rad}^2\\rangle = { k_0 ^ 3\\over2\\pi^2 } b^2\\left({k\\over k_0}\\right)^{{n_{\\rm iso}}-1}\\,,\\\\[2 mm ] \\delta_{{{\\cal r}}{{\\cal s}}}^2(k)\\!&\\equiv&\\!{k^3\\over2\\pi^2 } \\nonumber \\langle{{\\cal r}}_{\\rm rad}{{\\cal s}}_{\\rm rad}\\rangle \\ ,",

    "we also introduced an arbitrary pivot scale @xmath23 , at which the amplitude parameters are defined through @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "in addition to the fact that curvature and entropy perturbations are generally correlated at the end of inflation , some extra correlation can be generated later by the partial conversion of isocurvature into adiabatic perturbations .",
    "the correlation angle @xmath26 is in general a function of @xmath27 , and in the above definitions , we approximated @xmath28 by a power law with amplitude @xmath29 and tilt @xmath30 .",
    "so , we assumed implicitly that the inequality @xmath31 holds over all relevant scales .",
    "we will enforce this condition in the following analysis .",
    "the angular power spectrum of temperature and polarization anisotropies seen in the cmb today can be obtained from the radiation transfer functions for adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , computed from the initial conditions @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , and convolved with the initial power spectra , @xmath36 ^ 2\\ , \\left({k\\over k_0}\\right)^{{n_{\\rm ad}}-1}\\,,\\\\[2 mm ] c_l^{\\rm iso}\\!&\\equiv&\\,\\int { dk\\over k}\\ , \\left[\\theta_l^{\\rm iso}(k)\\right]^2\\ , \\left({k\\over k_0}\\right)^{{n_{\\rm iso}}-1}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ] c_l^{\\rm cor}\\!&\\equiv&\\,\\int { dk\\over k}\\ ,",

    "there is an obvious relation between both parametrizations : @xmath47 this notation has the advantage that the full parameter space of @xmath48 is contained within an ellipse .",
    "the north and south rims correspond to fully correlated ( @xmath49 ) and fully anticorrelated ( @xmath50 ) perturbations , with the equator corresponding to uncorrelated perturbations ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the east and west correspond to purely isocurvature and purely adiabatic perturbations , respectively .",
    "any other point within the ellipse is an arbitrary admixture of adiabatic and isocurvature modes .",
    "we should emphasize that the three amplitude parameters @xmath52 , @xmath2 and @xmath45 are defined at @xmath53 , and that comparing bounds from various papers is straightforward only when the pivot scale is the same .",
    "for instance , in the simple case where @xmath54 , @xmath2 is independent of @xmath23 , but this is not the case for @xmath45 : if @xmath55 , points within the @xmath48 ellipse are shifted vertically toward the edges of the ellipse when one increases @xmath23 and shifted toward the horizontal @xmath56 line when one decreases @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath57 , both @xmath2 and @xmath45 depend on the pivot scale .",
    "in addition , by changing the prior on the amplitudes , a shift in the pivot scale affects the @xmath58 likelihood quite dramatically  @xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we will use @xmath59  mpc@xmath5 , which is the most frequent choice in the literature .",
    "this value corresponds roughly to the multipole number @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath61 is roughly independent of the tilt values .",
    "for cosmological parameters close to the best - fit @xmath62cdm model , one finds @xmath63 .",
    "the smallness of this number comes from the fact that @xmath33 is strongly suppressed with respect to @xmath64 for large wavenumbers .",
    "indeed , the metric perturbations induced by isocurvature perturbations remain small during radiation domination : so , for small scales entering early inside the hubble radius , the amplitude of the photon acoustic oscillations is also small ( as can be seen via its transfer function ) . as a consequence , even if during radiation domination one has @xmath65 ( corresponding to @xmath66 or @xmath67 ) the isocurvature mode contributes only to 1% of the observed anisotropy near @xmath68 . of course",
    ", if @xmath58 is very different from @xmath69 , there could still be a large isocurvature contribution at either larger or smaller scales .",
    "since in the following we will focus on the constraints induced on mixed ad+cdi models by the lyman-@xmath2 data , let us give a few details on the shape of the linear matter power spectrum @xmath70\\,.&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath71 and @xmath72 are computed from the initial conditions @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , exactly like @xmath64 and @xmath33 , and the cross - correlated term is simply given by @xmath73^{{{1\\over2}}},\\ ] ] where the minus sign comes from the fact that with our definition of @xmath74 , a positive correlation @xmath75 in the early universe implies a reduction of the matter power spectrum today , and vice - versa .    in the limit @xmath76 , where @xmath77 corresponds to modes crossing the hubble length at the time of equality",
    ", it is well known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that the power spectra obey , to first approximation , @xmath78 which shows that for @xmath79 the isocurvature contribution to the small - scale power spectrum is generically much redder than the adiabatic one .",
    "the relative amplitude depends on the cosmological parameters . in the vicinity of the concordance @xmath62cdm model",
    ", one finds @xmath80 for cdi .",
    "so , like for cmb anisotropies , we see that even when @xmath65 in the early universe ( i.e. @xmath81 or @xmath82 ) , the isocurvature contribution to the currently observed power spectrum is only of the per cent order , at least near the pivot scale",
    ". however , for large @xmath58 , the contribution may be large on small scales .",
    "indeed , a large portion of the parameter region allowed by previous studies corresponds to a significant isocurvature fraction @xmath83 and to a very blue tilt @xmath84 . in this case , the matter power spectrum is affected or even dominated by the non - adiabatic contribution on small scales ( typically for wavenumbers @xmath85mpc ) .",
    "we illustrate this behavior on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a particular set of ad+cdi models with two different values of the isocurvature tilt , @xmath86 or @xmath87 , and many possible values of @xmath88 .",
    "the impact of the non - adiabatic contribution consists either in a smooth change of the effective slope on small scales , or more radically in a sharp feature ( a pronounced break or a dip ) .",
    "the second situation can occur on relevant scales for large positive @xmath45 , and of course large enough values of @xmath2 and @xmath58 .",
    "it is well established by analytical calculation and hydrodynamical simulations that the lyman-@xmath2  forest blueward of the lyman-@xmath2  emission line in qso spectra is produced by the inhomogeneous distribution of a warm ( @xmath89 k ) and photoionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) along the line of sight .",
    "the opacity fluctuations in the spectra arise from fluctuations in the matter density and trace the gravitational clustering of the matter distribution in the quasi - linear regime @xcite .",
    "the lyman-@xmath2  forest has thus been used extensively as a probe of the matter power spectrum on comoving scales of @xmath90mpc @xcite .",
    "the lyman-@xmath2  optical depth in velocity space @xmath91 ( km / s ) is related to the neutral hydrogen distribution in real space as ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath92dy \\ ; , \\label{eqtau2}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 @xmath94 is the hydrogen ly@xmath2 cross - section , @xmath95 is the real - space coordinate ( in km s@xmath5 ) , @xmath96 is the standard voigt profile normalized in real - space , @xmath97 is the velocity dispersion in units of @xmath98 , @xmath99 the hubble parameter , @xmath100 is the local density of neutral hydrogen and @xmath101 is the peculiar velocity along the line - of - sight .",
    "the density of neutral hydrogen can be obtained by solving the photoionization equilibrium equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the neutral hydrogen in the igm responsible for the lyman-@xmath2  forest absorptions is highly ionized due to the metagalactic ultraviolet ( uv ) background radiation produced by stars and qsos at high redshift .",
    "this optically thin gas in photoionization equilibrium produces a lyman-@xmath2  optical depth of order unity .",
    "the balance between the photoionization heating by the uv background and adiabatic cooling by the expansion of the universe drives most of the gas with @xmath102 , which dominates the lyman-@xmath2  opacity , onto a power - law density relation @xmath103 , where the parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 depend on the reionization history and spectral shape of the uv background and @xmath106 is the local gas overdensity ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the relevant physical processes can be readily modelled in hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the physics of a photoionized igm that traces the dark matter distribution is , however , sufficiently simple that considerable insight can be gained from analytical modeling of the igm opacity based on the so called fluctuating gunn peterson approximation neglecting the effect of peculiar velocities and the thermal broadening @xcite .",
    "the fluctuating gunn peterson approximation makes use of the power - law temperature density relation and describes the relation between lyman-@xmath2  opacity and gas density ( see @xcite ) along a given line of sight as follows , @xmath108 where @xmath109 in the range @xmath110 , @xmath111 the hi photoionization rate , @xmath112 km / s / mpc the hubble parameter at redshift zero . for a quantitative analysis ,",
    "however , full hydrodynamical simulations , which properly simulate the non - linear evolution of the igm and its thermal state , are needed .",
    "equations ( [ eqtau2 ] ) and ( [ eqtau ] ) show how the observed flux @xmath113 depends on the underlying local gas density @xmath114 , which in turn is simply related to the dark matter density , at least at large scales where the baryonic pressure can be neglected @xcite .",
    "statistical properties of the flux distribution , such as the flux power spectrum , are thus closely related to the statistical properties of the underlying matter density field .",
    "the power spectrum of the observed flux in high - resolution lyman-@xmath2  forest data provides meaningful constraints on the dark matter power spectrum on scales of @xmath115 , roughly corresponding to scales of @xmath90mpc ( somewhat dependent on the cosmological model ) . at",
    "larger scales the errors due to uncertainties in fitting a continuum ( i.e. in removing the long wavelength dependence of the spectrum emitted by each qso ) become very large while at smaller scales the contribution of metal absorption systems becomes dominant ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper , we will use the dark matter power spectrum that viel , haehnelt & springel  @xcite ( vhs ) inferred from the flux power spectra of the croft et al .",
    "@xcite ( c02 ) sample and the luqas sample of high - resolution lyman-@xmath2  forest data @xcite . the c02 sample consists of 30 keck",
    "high resolution hires spectra and 23 keck low resolution lris spectra and has a median redshift of @xmath116 .",
    "the luqas sample contains 27 spectra taken with the uves spectrograph and has a median redshift of @xmath117 .",
    "the resolution of the spectra is 6 km / s , 8 km / s and 130 km / s for the uves , hires and lris spectra , respectively .",
    "the s / n per resolution element is typically 30 - 50 .",
    "damped and sub - damped lyman-@xmath2  systems have been removed from the luqas sample and their impact on the flux power spectrum has been quantified by @xcite .",
    "estimates for the errors introduced by continuum fitting , the presence of metal lines in the forest region and strong absorptions systems have also been made  @xcite .",
    "vhs have used numerical simulation to calibrate the relation between flux power spectrum and linear dark matter power spectrum with a method proposed by c02 and improved by @xcite and vhs .",
    "a set of hydrodynamical simulations for a coarse grid of the relevant parameters is used to find a model that provides a reasonable but not exact fit to the observed flux power spectrum .",
    "then , it is assumed that the differences between the model and the observed linear power spectrum depend linearly on the matter power spectrum .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations are used to determine a bias function between flux and matter power spectrum : @xmath118 , on the range of scales of interest . in this way",
    "the linear matter power spectrum can be recovered with reasonable computational resources .",
    "this method has been found to be robust provided the systematic uncertainties are properly taken into account @xcite . running hydrodynamical simulations for a fine grid of all the relevant parameters",
    "is unfortunately computationally prohibitive ( see discussion in @xcite on a possible attempt to overcome this problem ) .",
    "we have seen in section [ mps ] that the isocurvature mode contribution can create distortions in the small - scale linear matter power spectrum .",
    "of course , this extra freedom was not taken into account in the definition of the grid of models in vhs . in principle",
    ", we should run simulations for a new grid with extra parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath45 , @xmath58 , @xmath30 ) .",
    "alternatively , we can carry a tentative analysis with the same function @xmath119 and the same error bars as in the pure adiabatic case , and check the validity of our results _",
    "a posteriori_. the idea is simply to select a marginally excluded model with the largest possible deviation from adiabaticity in the matter power spectrum . for this model",
    ", we run a new hydrodynamical simulation and we compare @xmath120 with the function @xmath121 used in the analysis . in case of good agreement , the results will be validated .",
    "we expect this agreement to be fairly good on large scales , but deviations should appear on small scales , because of the different non - linear evolution .",
    "the use of state - of - the - art hydrodynamical simulations is a significant improvement compared to previous studies which used numerical simulation of dark matter only @xcite .",
    "we use the parallel treesph code gadget - ii @xcite in its treepm mode which speeds up the calculation of long - range gravitational forces considerably .",
    "the simulations are performed with periodic boundary conditions with an equal number of dark matter and gas particles .",
    "radiative cooling and heating processes are followed using an implementation similar to @xcite for a primordial mix of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the uv background is given by @xcite . to maximise the speed of the simulation",
    "a simplified criterion of star formation has been applied : all the gas at overdensities larger than 1000 times the mean overdensity is turned into stars @xcite .",
    "the simulations were run on cosmos , a 152 gb shared memory altix 3700 with 152 cpus hosted at the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics ( cambridge ) .",
    "there is a number of systematic uncertainties and statistical errors which affect the inferred power spectrum and an extensive discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "vhs estimated the uncertainty of the overall _ rms _ fluctuation amplitude of matter fluctuation to be 14.5 % with a wide range of different factors contributing .",
    "we present here a brief summary . the effective optical depth , @xmath122 which is essential for the calibration procedure has to be determined separately from the absorption spectra . as discussed in vhs , there is a considerable spread in the measurement of the effective optical depth in the literature .",
    "determinations from low - resolution low s / n spectra give systematically higher values than high - resolution high s / n spectra .",
    "however , there is little doubt that the lower values from high - resolution high s / n spectra are appropriate and the range suggested in vhs leads to a 8% uncertainty in the _ rms _ fluctuation amplitude of the matter density field ( see table 5 in vhs ) .",
    "other uncertainties are the slope and normalization of the temperature - density relation of the absorbing gas which is usually parametrised as @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath104 and @xmath105 together contribute up to 5% to the error of the inferred fluctuation amplitude .",
    "vhs further estimated that uncertainties due to the c02 method ( due to fitting the observed flux power spectrum with a bias function which is extracted at a slightly different redshift than the observations ) contribute about 5% .",
    "they further assigned a 5 % uncertainty to the somewhat uncertain effect of galactic winds and finally an 8% uncertainty due the numerical simulations ( codes used by different groups give somewhat different results ) .",
    "summed in quadrature , all these errors led to the estimate of the overall uncertainty of 14.5% in the _ rms _ fluctuation amplitude of the matter density field .",
    "for our analysis we use the inferred dm power spectrum in the range @xmath115 as given in table 4 of vhs .",

    "unfortunately at smaller scales the systematic errors become prohibitively large mainly due to the large contribution of metal absorption lines to the flux power spectrum ( see fig . 3 of ref .",

    "<S> various recent studies proved that cosmological models with a significant contribution from cold dark matter isocurvature perturbations are still compatible with most recent data on cosmic microwave background anisotropies and on the shape of the galaxy power spectrum , provided that one allows for a very blue spectrum of primordial entropy fluctuations ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , such models predict an excess of matter fluctuations on small scales , typically below @xmath1 . we show that the proper inclusion of high - resolution high signal - to - noise lyman-@xmath2 forest data excludes most of these models . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound on the isocurvature fraction @xmath3 , defined at the pivot scale @xmath4  mpc@xmath5 , is pushed down to @xmath6 , while @xmath7 ( 95% confidence limits ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the bounds on curvaton models characterized by maximal correlation between curvature and isocurvature modes , and a unique spectral tilt for both . </S>",
