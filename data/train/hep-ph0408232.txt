    "exclusive @xmath0 meson decays are important for extracting the fundamental standard model parameters , such as the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , and for exploring new physics .",
    "they are complicated due to strong dynamics , which must be well understood in order to achieve the above goals .",
    "especially , qcd theories for two - body nonleptonic decays are necessary .",
    "several approaches based on different factorization theorems have been developed , which include perturbatiove qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite , qcd - improved factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite , soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite , light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) @xcite , and light - front qcd ( lfqcd ) @xcite .",
    "most of them are based on collinear factorization @xcite , but pqcd is based on @xmath1 factorization @xcite . in this talk",
    "i will briefly explain the differences between collinear and @xmath1 factorizations , and review recent progress on exclusive @xmath0 meson decays made in pqcd , concentrating on the evolution of the @xmath0 meson wave function , radiative decays , polarizations in @xmath2 modes , and new physics effect in @xmath4 .",
    "according to factorization theorems , the amplitude for an exclusive process is calculated as an expansion of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes a large momentum transfer , and @xmath8 is a small hadronic scale . for exclusive processes , such as hadron form factors ,",
    "collinear factorization was developed in @xcite .",
    "take the pion form factor @xmath9 involved in the scattering process @xmath10 as an example .",
    "@xmath11 is expressed , up to next - to - leading order and next - to - leading power ( incomplete ) , as @xmath12 with each term being indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the above expression @xmath13 is the nonperturbative pion wave function , @xmath14 the two - parton twist-3 pion wave function , and @xmath15 the perturbative hard kernels .",
    "@xmath16 stands for the convolutions in parton momentum fractions in collinear factorization , and in both parton momentum fractions and transverse momenta in @xmath1 factorization .",
    "a parton momentum fraction @xmath17 must be integrated over in the range between 0 and 1 .",
    "hence , the end - point region with a small @xmath17 is not avoidable .",
    "if there is no end - point singularity developed in a formula , collinear factorization works . if such a singularity occurs , indicating the breakdown of collinear factorization , @xmath1 factorization should be employed @xcite .",
    "moreover , factorization theorems do not only state the separation of perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics , but require controllable subleading effects .",

    "however , @xmath68 , @xmath2 modes with the vector meson @xmath69 emitted from the weak vertex do not involve the chiral scale @xmath66 , and the chiral enhancement is absent in qcdf .",
