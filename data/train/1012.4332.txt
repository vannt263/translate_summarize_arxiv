    "the structural transition from a linear chain of repulsively interacting particles to a planar configuration , in the form of a zigzag structure , has been often discussed in theoretical studies on atomic and condensed matter systems .",
    "examples include electrons in nanowires  @xcite , ultracold dipolar gases  @xcite , vortex lines in bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , and ion coulomb crystals in traps  @xcite .",
    "specifically in ion coulomb crystals this transition has been experimentally observed and characterized  @xcite , thereby determining a phase diagram of the ionic structures as a function of the trap aspect ratio and of the mean interparticle distance  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies demonstrated that the transition from the string to the zigzag chain is associated with a symmetry breaking .",
    "more specifically , if the hamiltonian is invariant under rotation about the string axis , it is the rotational symmetry around the chain which is broken in the zigzag phase .",
    "if instead the motion of the interacting particles is confined to the plane , the zigzag phase breaks the symmetry by reflection about the chain axis .",
    "the phase transition predicted by the classical theory is hence second - order  @xcite .",
    "it can be described by a landau model , of which critical values and exponents are well known  @xcite , and where the soft mode is the zigzag mode of the linear chain  namely , the transverse mode with the shorthest wavelength  which drives the instability and determines the new structure .",
    "the corresponding ginzburg - landau equation in the continuum limit and in presence of damping was reported in ref .",
    ", where special focus was given on creation of defects when quenching the value of the transverse trap frequency across the mechanical instability .",
    "further works discussed the structural transitions when the external potential is not harmonic  @xcite , showing that the statistical mechanics of the system at the instability may be profoundly modified .",

    "is the temperature of the sample and the dimensionless parameter @xmath2 is tuned by the confining potential or the interparticle distance .",
    "the value @xmath3 corresponds to the value of the transverse frequency , where the linear chain is classically unstable  @xcite .",
    "the quantum critical point , at @xmath4 , separates the linear chain from the zigzag phase at @xmath5 . for @xmath6",
    "quantum fluctuations dominate , and the crystal is in the linear ( disordered ) phase .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the boundaries of the quantum critical region , where thermal fluctuations dominate . ]    in ref .",
    "we addressed the question , whether quantum fluctuations significantly modify the location of the critical point and the behavior in its vicinity , focussing on ion coulomb crystals .",
    "this question draws on numerical studies in low dimensional dipolar systems , which showed a significant contribution of quantum fluctuations at the transition from a string to a zigzag order  @xcite . in this article",
    "we provide the detailed calculations at the basis of the results presented in ref .  , and extend the treatment to interacting atomic chains , with repulsive interaction potential scaling with @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "we focus on the case where the motion of the particles is confined to a plane .",
    "as argued below , the string - to - zigzag transition is indeed a quantum phase transition analogous to the ferromagnetic transition of an ising chain in a transverse field  @xcite . a phase diagram summarizing the behavior in its vicinity",

    "note that a similar mapping to the ising model was argued in the context of electronic systems in quantum wires  @xcite .",
    "however , the validity of the assumed equivalence between a continuous field theoretical model and a discrete ( @xmath9 ) field - theory can not be justified on the basis of classification into universality classes below three space dimensions  @xcite .    in the present study",
    "we develop a quantum field theoretical approach , which allows a direct mapping to the quantum one  dimensional ising model under plausible assumptions . on this basis",
    "we determine the quantum critical point at which the transition occurs and identify the experimental parameters , for which it can be distinguished from the value predicted by the classical theory  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we relate the critical value of the transverse trap frequency @xmath10 to the ratio of the typical kinetic energy scale @xmath11 and interaction energy @xmath12 . defining a parameter @xmath13 , which describes the deviation of the transverse confinement from its stability point",
    ", we find that the critical point is given by @xmath14 .",
    "a measurement is suggested , which can demonstrate transverse quantum fluctuations in a long chain of trapped ions ( composed of hundreds of ions ) and probe the different regimes in the phase diagram .",

    "we start by considering a linear array of particles with mass @xmath15 , which are confined in the @xmath16 plane .",

    "this model includes the coulomb interaction when @xmath29 and the dipolar interaction when @xmath30 , assuming that the dipoles are polarized along the @xmath21 axis , such that in the @xmath16 plane they experience an isotropic repulsive force .",
    "we also note that in the case of the coulomb interaction the strength is such that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the charge of the particle . in this case",
    "the array can result from the self - organization of the atoms , since quasi - long - range order can be assumed as long as one particle in the chain is pinned . the configuration , in which the particles are aligned along the @xmath17-axis with uniform interparticle distance , could be realized in a ring trap at ultralow temperatures under the condition that one ion is pinned  @xcite , or in a anharmonic linear paul trap  @xcite .",
    "it also corresponds with good approximation to the ions distribution at the center of a long chain in a linear paul trap  @xcite .    for @xmath33 ,",
    "on the other hand , particle - particle correlations decay at @xmath5 with a power law dependence on the distance  @xcite , and long - range order may be only assumed in presence of an additional periodic potential along @xmath17 , which localizes the particles at the positions @xmath34 . for dipolar atoms or molecules with an electric dipole moment @xmath35 , this configuration",
    "could be realized by means of an optical lattice  @xcite with periodicity @xmath18 . here",
    ", the dipole - dipole interaction can be made repulsive in the @xmath16 plane when a static electric field along the @xmath21 axis aligns the dipole .",
    "then , the strength of the interaction is such that @xmath36 .",
    "we assume temperatures such that the atoms crystallize and their motion is well approximated by harmonic vibrations about the equilibrium positions when the configuration is mechanically stable . while the linear chain is stable against longitudinal displacements from the equilibrium positions , a soft mode in the transverse direction drives a structural phase transition of the linear chain into a zigzag configuration , as shown in ref .  .",
    "this mode has wavelength @xmath37 , such that in the classical harmonic crystal the corresponding displacements are described by the function @xmath38 with @xmath39 the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "we therefore focus on the dynamics of the transverse phonon modes close to the instability and expand @xmath40 to fourth order in @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , we introduce the field @xmath42 , which describes a transverse excitation close to the instability and is slowly varying with respect to the length scale @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath43 using a gradient expansion to leading order  @xcite , we obtain the effective potential    @xmath44=v_t+v_{int } \\approx \\frac{1}{2}m\\nu_t^2a^2\\sum_{j=1}^n \\phi_j^2   + \\frac{a^2}{2a^\\alpha}\\sum_{i\\not = j}\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\left\\{-\\frac{(\\phi_i-(-1)^{i - j}\\phi_j)^2}{|i - j|^{\\alpha+2 } } + \\frac{(\\alpha+2)(\\phi_i-(-1)^{i - j}\\phi_j)^4}{4|i - j|^{\\alpha+4}}\\right\\}\\label{v_t_tot } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    terms describing the coupling between the axial and transverse modes have not been reported , because they give rise to higher order corrections in the gradient expansion .",

    "therefore , for the linear - zigzag instability the coulomb interaction effectively belongs to the class of short - range potentials .",
    "indeed , one finds that the spectrum of the transverse excitations close to the instability ( approaching from the side where the chain is stable classically ) behaves as @xmath64 for @xmath8 ( see for instance ref .",

    "these considerations on the structure , which are based on identifying the minima of the potential energy , do not account for the contribution of the kinetic energy .",
