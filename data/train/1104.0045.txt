    "( hereafter 103p ) is a jupiter family comet ( jfc ) , which currently has a orbital period and perihelion at 1.06  au . on ut  2010 oct .",
    "20.7 it reached the minimum geocentric distance of only 0.12  au , making by far the closest approach to the earth since its discovery @xcite , and becoming a naked - eye object . shortly after , on ut  2010 nov .",
    "4.6 , the comet was visited by nasa s epoxi spacecraft , which approached the nucleus within 700  km and provided detailed images and spectra @xcite . both the ground - based data , obtained at the unusually favorable geometry , and the unique observations carried out by the spacecraft , create an exceptional platform for new groundbreaking investigations .",
    "taking advantage of this unique opportunity we addressed one of the burning problems of planetary science , which is the characteristic lifetime of active cometary nuclei .",
    "they can be dynamically ejected out of the sublimation zone , or decay through collision , tidal disruption , devolatilization , deactivation , disintegration , and  the least understood  spontaneous fragmentation @xcite .",
    "of several scenarios proposed to explain the last process , a notable one is _ rotational break - up _ , which must occur for spinning bodies when the centripetal force surpasses self - gravity and material strength ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , models show that torques exerted by gas jets can significantly increase or decrease the rotation rate during a single orbit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the magnitude strongly depends on the nucleus size and activity , and the poorly understood effective moment arm .",
    "the first unambiguous measurement of this effect was obtained only recently for comet , which was found to be slowly spinning up @xcite .",
    "clearly , further observational studies of the dynamics of cometary rotation are essential to establish the nucleus lifetime with respect to rotational break - up .    since the influence of jets must be strongest for small , elongated , and active comets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the nucleus of 103p is an excellent test body : it is one of the smallest known jfcs ( equivalent radius @xmath2  m ) , it is elongated and active @xcite , and hence was predicted to show measurable period changes during the last return @xcite . in general , however , it is very difficult to investigate the rotation of an active nucleus ; especially of a very small one and from the ground  securing simultaneously the necessary measurement precision .",
    "our earlier studies show that perhaps the best possibilities are offered by mm / submm spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "when the molecules are emitted from discrete vents , or the body is irregular , the diurnal rotation modulates the emission line profiles , which can be conveniently studied in a velocity - resolved spectral time series .",
    "the effect will be best visible when every single spectrum results from the molecules released at similar nucleus rotation phases , which is satisfied when the molecules leave the projected telescope beam on a timescale much shorter than the body rotation period .",
    "the best candidates are hence nearby comets rotating slowly , and observed ideally in small beams using short integration times with the largest antennas .",
    "consequently , we identified 103p as a terrific target for large ground - based mm / submm telescopes @xcite , owing to the unusually small geocentric distance , localized activity , and more than sufficiently slow rotation ( the last two confirmed after the fact ) .",
    "between early september and mid december 2010 we used all large single - dish ground - based mm / submm facilities operating around one millimeter and offering open time , to carry out spectral monitoring of hcn .",
    "this molecule is a particularly good tracer of the cometary rotation @xcite thanks to its well - established origin directly from the nucleus and because it has by far the brightest emission lines in the one - millimeter atmospheric windows .",
    "our campaign was the first at these wavelengths specifically designed to investigate the rotation state of a comet , and thus provided an unprecedentedly rich and dense velocity - resolved spectral time series of a cometary parent molecule .    in this work we use 438 spectra of the and rotational transitions ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , collected with iram , jcmt , and cso on 20 nights between ut  2010 sep .",
    "29.3 and dec .  15.6 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the spectra were calibrated in the standard manner ; each covers 10 to 15  min , and was analyzed at spectral resolutions of 0.10  km  s@xmath3 ( high resolution ; hr ) and 0.25  km  s@xmath3 ( low resolution ; lr ) .",
    "details of the observations and reductions will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "the hr spectra were first parameterized in terms of the line area and center velocity and then converted to physical quantities : hcn production rate @xmath4 and median radial hcn gas - flow velocity @xmath5 .",
    "all these steps were performed following our standard methods and procedures @xcite , and will be described in a subsequent paper . in this work",
    "we only highlight our approach to estimate errors ( appendix  [ errors ] ) .",
    "although unavoidably affected by model simplifications , the physical quantities are naturally free ( to the first order ) of trivial instrumental , topocentric , and transition - specific differences , hence making the data set fairly homogeneous and suitable for the investigation of variability .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the evolution of @xmath4 with heliocentric distance @xmath6 , and displays @xmath5 against phase angle @xmath7 .    the first trend in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] was measured for several comets before ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we see an increase in the production rate as 103p approaches perihelion and a decrease afterwards , with superimposed short - term variability responsible for the excessive scatter .",
    "the maximum mean - diurnal level of hcn is about @xmath8 molec  s@xmath3 , which seems high for a jfc but not abnormal for a comet ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the ratio of hcn to h@xmath9o @xcite at the level of 0.1% is also typical of comets @xcite . after subtracting the heliocentric trend we derived production - rate deviations @xmath10 about the mean - diurnal level .",
    "the expected correlation of @xmath5 with @xmath7 has been observationally confirmed only recently @xcite ; however , in our data we do not find any trend ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , because of the highly limited phase - angle coverage , short - term variations , and observing noise .",
    "while the short - term variations could be sporadic @xcite , it is also entirely possible that they were stimulated by the nucleus rotation .",
    "we pursued this issue using an innovative technique : the _ dynamized structural periodicity analysis _",
    "( dspa ) , which we created specifically for this purpose ( appendix  [ dspa ] ) .",
    "the method was developed from our _ dynamized periodicity analysis _",
    "( dpa ) , which  utilizing classical algorithms for a time series of signals  introduces a dynamical formula for the body rotation and rigorous weighting of the input data @xcite .",
    "dpa determines the rotation frequency simultaneously with its time - derivative from the entire data set , taking advantage of the maximum available time base , and therefore is far superior compared to separate classical ( constant ) period determinations from smaller subsets .",
    "recently dpa demonstrated excellent sensitivity in providing important evidence for the slow spin - up of comet @xcite .",
    "dspa goes further , and analyzes periodicity not only in the level , but in the complete structure of the signal in the input data , properly combining the information from independent data channels . at the same time it keeps all the properties of dpa , and for a single - channel time series fully reduces to the latter .",
    "the technique does not rely on any variability models , neither versus time nor across the channels .",
    "although dspa allows for any a - priori law controlling the effective torque , in this analysis we assumed it was constant .    using the derived production - rate variations",
    "@xmath10 , we normalized the original spectra to eliminate all the trivial effects and remove the physical heliocentric trend ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in order to secure an affordable computation time and reasonable s / n in the individual data channels ,",
    "dspa was applied to the normalized lr spectra .",
    "we used 17 channels from the velocity interval between -2 and + 2  km  s@xmath3 , which is more than enough to adequately sample the line profile .",
    "they were analyzed with two well - established kernels : weighted version of _ phase dispersion minimization _",
    "( pdm ) and weighted _ harmonic fit _ ( hf ) @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] presents _ dynamical periodograms _ resulting from the analysis .",
    "the best single - peak solution is found for the rotation frequency @xmath11 h@xmath3 ( given at the epoch of the epoxi encounter ; indicated by index zero ) and frequency time - derivative @xmath12 h@xmath13 .",
    "it is equivalent to the period of @xmath14 h increasing at the relative rate of @xmath15 ( e.g. , @xmath16 min / day , or @xmath17 min / cycle ) , both applicable at the epoxi encounter .",
    "the result is insensitive to the uncertainties resulting from the earlier reductions  including the removal of the heliocentric trend , as the data most affected enter the analysis with very low relative statistical weights .",
    "we note that the global solution is very close to the third multiple of the above single - peak solution , which means that the pattern of mass loss repeats significantly better every three rotation cycles .",
    "we explain this behavior by excitation of the rotation state : every three cycles of the fundamental periodicity the independent rotation modes coincide at similar phases and then the repeats .",
    "but the resonance is not perfect .",
    "the spectra from the same rotation phases and corresponding cycles still show differences in the line profiles ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows spectra from phase 0.5 and _ cycle  b _ [ cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] ] , corresponding to the moment of the epoxi encounter ) .",
    "we attribute this effect primarily to small differences in the instantaneous nucleus orientation , which cause differences in the direction of gas flow .",
    "interestingly , the larger nucleus of comet was found close to a fully - relaxed rotation state @xcite , while the even bigger nucleus of was in a significantly excited state @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] also shows the production - rate variations @xmath10 and median radial gas - flow velocities @xmath5 phased according to the best single - peak solution and its third multiple .",
    "the line variability comes primarily from the diurnal changes in the production rate , which follow a nearly sinusoidal trend .",
    "the single - peak solution is consistent with a single strong active area being the primary source of hcn . as the epoxi encounter occurred at the rotation phase of 0.5 , when the hcn production rate was shortly before the diurnal maximum",
    ", we suppose that this area coincides with the strongest jet observed by the spacecraft @xcite .",
    "this also implies that the higher - order multi - peak solutions , including the triple - peak third multiple indicated by the global minimum , can not be plausibly associated with the fundamental periodicity .",
    "our best solution indicates a rapid spin - down of 103p s nucleus .",
    "spin - down at a comparable rate was suggested earlier for comet @xcite , but the only robust measurement , obtained for , indicates spin - up at a smaller rate @xcite .",
    "dynamics of the rotation rate can be interpreted in terms of a simple model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the rate of change in frequency @xmath18 is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gas sublimation velocity , @xmath21 is the ( mean - diurnal ) production rate of all gaseous species , @xmath22 is the volume - equivalent nucleus radius , @xmath23 is the nucleus bulk density , and @xmath24 is the dimensionless effective moment arm which is a measure of acceleration efficiency ; @xmath24 is negative for spin - down and positive for spin - up , and may exceed unity for non - spherical bodies @xcite . substituting the measured @xmath25 h@xmath13 , and",
    "@xmath26 kg  s@xmath3 @xcite , @xmath27 m  s@xmath3 @xcite , @xmath28 kg  m@xmath29 @xcite , and @xmath30  m @xcite , we find @xmath31 .",
    "the same equation yields @xmath32 for the properties of comet ( @xmath33 m [ 2005 ] , @xmath34 kg  s@xmath3 [ 2007 ] , and @xmath35 h@xmath13 [ 2011 ] ; otherwise the same as above ) , which is consistent with a model prediction @xmath36 @xcite . even though @xmath24 in 103p is two orders of magnitude lower compared to 9p , the comet changes its rotation frequency a factor of 20 faster .",
    "this is understandable from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , since @xmath18 has a strong dependence on the nucleus size , and the nucleus of 103p is tiny compared to 9p . moreover , 103p is more active per unit surface area ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and approaches the sun closer , therefore it has a higher total sublimation rate at perihelion , in spite of the much smaller total area .",
    "if the pattern of mass loss remains stable , the above result lets us crudely speculate about the rotational past and future of 103p on the current orbit .",
    "we estimate the orbit - integrated frequency change at the level of 0.012  h@xmath3 and assume the critical rotation period of approximately 3  h @xcite .",
    "this allows for no more than @xmath37 previous revolutions . at the present rate",
    ", the nucleus will stop rotating during the fourth or fifth return from now ( perihelion in 2036 or 2043 ) .",
    "if it survives the increased thermal stress , it should start spinning up in the opposite direction , and reach the rotational disruption limit @xmath38 orbits later .",
    "we note that rotational break - up has by far the shortest timescale determining the lifetime of such a small object @xcite .",
    "moreover , bearing in mind the location of the main active area on the nucleus @xcite , even a small change in the jet configuration may dramatically increase the effective moment arm  bringing 103p to the end of its life within one or few orbits .",
    "we expect that small , young , and naturally volatile - rich comets , having typical effective moment arms of the order of 5% , routinely experience rotational instability and fragmentation right after being injected to the sublimation zone yet before being discovered . in this way the observed flat size distribution of comet nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be naturally explained . with its tiny and active nucleus",
    ", 103p appears as a lucky survivor , protected for some limited time from rotational disruption by the remarkably low factor  @xmath24 .",
    "we thank m.  poliska for providing resources and the telescope staffs for their excellent work .",
    "this project was supported by nasa through the planetary astronomy program grant to d.  jewitt .",
    "_ facilities : _",
    "we have examined all error sources and concluded that the signal uncertainty in the individual spectral channels is dominated by observing noise and imperfect pointing .    observing noise",
    "was estimated from signal variations about the baseline assuming a normal distribution .",
    "since noise is nearly entirely controlled by the sky and receiver temperatures ( surpassing the comet antenna temperature by about two orders of magnitude ) , we assumed the same noise level inside the line window .",
    "noise dependence on frequency is negligible in this extremely narrow spectral range .",
    "the influence of pointing errors was estimated from a simple model , which we have developed for this purpose from our earlier constructions @xcite . for each telescope axis",
    "we assume a normally - distributed pointing error with a standard deviation of @xmath39 for iram and jcmt , and @xmath40 for cso ; it is easy to show that this is equal to the most probable total pointing offset .",
    "we also adopt a simple steady - state isotropic coma model with infinite molecular lifetime and brightness proportional to the number of molecules . under these assumptions we calculated probability density functions ( pdfs ) of signal loss for each telescope , and neglected other ( less significant ) effects from imperfect pointing .    to calculate the errors of all the parameters of interest we followed our monte - carlo approach @xcite , and generated 500 simulations using the derived pdfs .",
    "a starting point for each simulation was an original spectrum corrected for the most probable signal loss from pointing .",
    "to each spectral channel we added a random realization of noise and then scaled the complete spectrum according to a random realization of signal loss from pointing .",
    "then , by analyzing the parameters variations about their original values , we derived their standard errors .",
    "the signal errors in the individual spectral channels feature several interesting properties . with signal approaching zero",
    "they asymptotically approach the noise limit , and oppositely , they approach the pointing limit with the signal increasing to infinity . the pointing component is proportional to signal whereas the noise component does not depend on signal . while the noise component can be controlled ( reduced ) by spectral or temporal binning , the pointing component can not , because it affects all the channels in one spectrum in the same way , and similarly several spectra taken within short time ( the latter not being taken into account by our simple model ) . for this reason",
    "the pointing component should not be included when analyzing signal variability across the channels .",
    "moreover , the error from pointing is nearly one - sided ( positive ) while the one from noise is symmetric .",
    "because several of the assumptions of our model may not be well satisfied , the provided uncertainties should be considered as crude estimates .",
    "nevertheless , to our best knowledge it is the first approach to quantify how the imperfect pointing of radio telescopes affects the observed spectra .",
    "the dspa method is applied to a time series of @xmath41 measurements .",
    "quality of data phasing is measured by a function @xmath42 , which is a variance ratio of the phased and unphased data .",
    "dspa calculates functions @xmath43 of dpa @xcite for every data channel @xmath44 , and averages the results from the considered @xmath45 channels to provide @xmath46 : @xmath47 using weights @xmath48 defined as square - mean signal over mean - square error : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the signal in @xmath44-th data channel and @xmath51-th time moment , @xmath52 is its standard error , and @xmath53 .",
    "note that both functions @xmath54 used by dpa , i.e. the weighted version of pdm and the weighted hf , use the same weights @xmath55 as above .",
    "since our signal errors are asymmetric , we used their mean - square values for this purpose .    weighting with @xmath48",
    "implemented in dspa naturally prefers channels with strong signal , making the method insensitive , from the theoretical point of view , to the selection of line window ( as long as the line is fully inside ) ; channels having on average zero signal contribute to @xmath56 with zero weights .",
    "moreover , it prefers channels with small uncertainties , which is particularly important in this application since imperfect pointing differentiates signal error across the channels ; for identical uncertainties in every channel this term cancels out .",
    "it is therefore clear that in our case the effective channel weight is established by the fine balance between channel signal and noise  as the error from pointing is proportional to the signal .",
