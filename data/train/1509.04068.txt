    "nowadays the standard model ( sm ) becomes trustworthy to describe microscopic fundamental physics , since the sm higgs has been discovered at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "however it has to be still extended in order to include dark matter ( dm ) and ( minuscule but ) massive neutrinos that make an allusion to their existence by overwhelming experimental evidences .",
    "one of the economical and elegant solutions to resolve these controversial issues is to accommodate radiative seesaw models to sm , in which active neutrino masses are radiatively arisen and exotic fields are naturally introduced to induce such tiny masses .",
    "such an exotic field can be frequently identified as a dm candidate . in this sense",
    ", one might find that neutrinos have a strong correlation to the dm candidate . following the landmarks  @xcite ,",
    "a vast of literature on radiative seesaw model has recently arisen in refs .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we employ new fermions and bosons in addition to the sm - like higgs boson , in which the leading neutrino masses can be induced at the two - loop level where the relevant lagrangian is controlled by an additional global @xmath0 symmetry . and the effective tri - linear coupling between the sm - like higgs and an isospin triplet boson , which is needed to have a massive cp - odd neutral boson , is also generated at the one - loop level through such exotic fields after the global @xmath0 symmetry spontaneously .    following the paper of @xcite ,",
    "the neutral component can be a dm candidate if there is enough mass difference between two neutral fermions to evade the constraint of the direct detection searches via the sm neutral gauge boson ( z ) .",
    "the mass difference arises from the type - ii like term after acquiring the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the isospin triplet boson .",
    "however since the mass difference is very tiny because its vev be less than a few gev constrained by the electroweak precision test , we have to work on the co - annihilation system to obtain the observed relic density , if we focus on rather lighter dm mass that is less than 80 gev .",
    "heavy charged lepton masses themselves are constrained by the lep and lhc experiment , and the mass difference between the dm mass and its lepton is also constrained by the electroweak precision test . as a result ,",
    "the allowed range of the dm mass can be highly restricted .",
    "we have two new sources to explain the deviation of anomalous magnetic moment to sm .",
    "however either of them that has a strong correlation to the neutrino masses can not reach the sizable value of the anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "this is because the neutrino oscillation requires rather large off - diagonal neutrino mass matrix elements , which tends to be in conflict with the anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "notice here that constraints of the lepton flavor violations ( lfvs ) that always emerge in such radiative models are not so strong to restrict the yukawa couplings related to the neutrino masses .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we show our model building including higgs masses , neutrino mass , lfv , muon anomalous magnetic moment , and dm . in sec .",
    "iii , we show our numerical results .",
    "we conclude in sec .  vi .",
    "in this section , we review our model , in which the particle contents for leptons and bosons are respectively shown in tab .  [ tab:1 ] and tab .  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "we add vector - like fermions of @xmath1 with isospin doublet and @xmath2 with isospin singlet , but @xmath3 charge under the global symmetry to the sm fields .",
    "each of the exotic field needs ( at least ) two flavors in order to satisfy current neutrino oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "moreover , an introduction of @xmath4 is requested only to have mass difference between the neutral component and the charged component of @xmath5 in our model .",
    "otherwise our dm ( neutral component of @xmath5 ) does not satisfy the observed relic density @xmath60.12  @xcite due to an enhancement of its thermal averaged cross section with co - annihilation system , as we will discuss later . as for new bosons , we introduce two neutral isospin singlet scalars @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 global charge for each , an isospin doublet scalar @xmath11 with the @xmath12 global charge , and an isospin triplet scalar @xmath13 with the @xmath14 global charge .",
    "note here that @xmath15 is neutral under the global charge not to couple to our physical goldstone boson .",
    "then we assume that @xmath15 , @xmath7 , and @xmath13 have vev , which are symbolized by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "vev of @xmath7 spontaneously breaks the global symmetry down . even after the global @xmath0 breaking as well as the electroweak breaking , a remnant discrete symmetry @xmath19 remains , which is understood as an accidental symmetry .",
    "this @xmath19 symmetry plays a role in assuring the stability of our dm candidate ; neutral component of @xmath1 .",
