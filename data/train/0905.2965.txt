    "induced by accretion of gas on to a super massive ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) black hole ( smbh ) , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) release a large amount of energy by radiating photons ( @xmath9@xmath10 ) .",
    "these photons influence the physical properties ( e.g.  the ionization structure , gas dynamics and density distribution ) of the vicinity of agn , the agn host galaxies , and the inter - galactic media of galaxy clusters to which they belong ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "importance of the feedback from agn has been recognised in many areas of astrophysics , e.g.  ( i )  co - evolution of galaxies and black holes ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( ii )  star formation in host galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( iii )  the so - called cooling flow problem in galaxy clusters ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the form of agn feedback can be mechanical ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or radiative in which photon momentum , energy or both are dynamically important ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the radiation can produce mechanical feedback via radiation pressure on matter in the form of outflows / winds ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a strong support for the existence of such ( radiation - driven ) winds is often found in the highly blueshifted broad absorption line features seen in the uv and optical spectra of agn ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , provided the ionization state of the gas is appropriate .",
    "we note that the outflows can be also produced by magnetocentrifugal force ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , poynting flux / magnetic towers ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and thermal pressure ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in our previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter papers  i , ii and iii , respectively ) , we performed hydrodynamical simulations of radiatively driven agn outflows produced from the infalling gas .",
    "our models include radiation forces due to electron scattering and line processes , and radiative cooling / heating .",
    "these models use a fixed accretion luminosity during the whole simulations regardless of the mass inflow rate through the model inner boundary . in principle , the rate at which the gas is supplied to the region below the inner boundary ( @xmath0  pc ) would influence the mass accretion rate on to the smbh at the centre and its luminosity .",
    "this could results in models with an inconsistent amount of the radiative feedback for a given amount of the mass supplied rate to the inner region of agn . here",
    "we relax this assumption of the constant luminosity , and instead dynamically couple the accretion luminosity to the mass supply rate . with this coupling , we examine the following two key issues in this study .",
    "firstly , we investigate how the mass - outflow rate depends on the self - consistently determined accretion luminosity ( or equivalently the eddington ratio @xmath11 of the system ) .",
    "this provides a useful information on the mass supply rate and the mass inflow morphology which can be incorporated with a smaller scale disc accretion model ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the mass - outflow rates predicted here can be incorporated with a larger scale galaxy evolution model ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , we test whether steady state solutions with a super - eddington luminosity are possible when the main radiation source has a disc geometry instead of a spherical geometry .",
    "the system with the disc radiation field has a possible channel of a high mass supply rate along a equatorial plane at a large distance from the disc itself . because of the disc geometry",
    ", the radiation would peak strongly along the pole or disc axis directions , and it would gradually decrease toward equatorial direction hence the radiation force is much weaker in the equatorial plane .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe our method and model assumptions . we give the results of our hydrodynamical simulations in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "discussions on accretion flows with a super - eddington luminosity and the effect of artificially limiting luminosity are given in section  [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "finally , the conclusions of this study are summarised in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we mainly follow the methods used for the axisymmetric models by @xcite and @xcite , but with a change in the treatment of the accretion luminosity ( section  [ sub : coupling - of - mass - accretion ] ) .",
    "the model geometry and the assumptions of the smbh and the disc are very similar to those in papers  i , ii and iii .",
    "readers are referred to fig .  1 of paper  iii for the diagram of our basic model configuration .",
    "a smbh with its mass @xmath12 and its schwarzschild radius @xmath13 is placed at the centre of the polar coordinate system ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the x - ray emitting corona regions is defined as a sphere with its radius @xmath16 which surrounds the smbh . the geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disc ( e.g.  @xcite ) is placed on the equatorial plane ( @xmath17 plane ) .",
    "the normal vector of the disc coincides with the symmetry axis .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations will be performed in the polar coordinate system ( assuming axisymmetry ) with @xmath14 between the inner boundary @xmath18 and the outer boundary @xmath19 .",
    "the radiation forces , from the corona region ( the sphere with its radius @xmath16 ) and the accretion disc , acting on the gas are assumed to be radial only .",
    "the point - source like approximation for the disc radiation pressure is used here since the accretion disc radius ( @xmath20 ) is assumed to be much smaller than the inner radius , i.e.  @xmath21 .    because of the assumed flat accretion disc geometry , the disc radiation flux ( @xmath22 ) peaks in the direction of the disc rotational axis , and it gradually decreases as the polar angle @xmath15 increases , i.e.  @xmath23 .",
    "the flow is also irradiated by the corona which is assumed to be spherical .",
    "further , we assume that the total accretion luminosity @xmath3 consists of two components : ( 1 )  @xmath24 due to the accretion disc and ( 2 )  @xmath25 due to the corona we assume that the disc emits only uv photons , whereas the corona emits only x - rays , i.e.  the system uv luminosity , @xmath26 and the system x - ray luminosity , @xmath27 ( in other words @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "we employ hydrodynamical ( hd ) simulations of the outflow from accretion on to a central part of agn in 2-d ( axisymmetric ) , using the zeus - mp code ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which is a massively parallel mpi - implemented version of the zeus-3d code ( cf .",
    ", @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the zeus - mp is a eulerian hydrodynamics code which uses the method of finite differencing on a staggered mesh with a second - order - accurate , monotonic advection scheme @xcite . to compute the structure and evolution of a flow irradiated by a strong continuum radiation of agn , we solve the following set of hd equations : @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the mass density , energy density , pressure , and the velocity of gas respectively",
    ". also , @xmath37 is the gravitational force per unit mass .",
    "the lagrangian / co - moving derivative is defined as @xmath38 .",
    "we have introduced two new components to the zeus - mp in order to treat the gas dynamics more appropriate for the flow in and around agn .",
    "the first is the acceleration due to radiative force per unit mass ( @xmath39 ) in equation  [ eq : hydro02 ] , and the second is the the effect of radiative cooling and heating , simply as the net cooling rate ( @xmath40 ) in equation  [ eq : hydro03 ] .",
    "we assume the equation of state to be in the form of @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the adiabatic index , and @xmath43 for all the models presented in this paper .",
    "our numerical method used in this paper are identical , in most aspects , to that described in papers  i and ii .",
    "next , we briefly discuss our implementation of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .        in our previous models ( papers  i ,",
    "ii and iii ) , the accretion luminosity of the system is kept fixed . consequently , the radiative feedback may not be consistent with the mass supplied to the inner region of agn transferred from our inner boundary . to overcome this possible inconsistency of the accretion luminosity and the mass inflow rate , we relax the assumption of the constant luminosity .",
    "the luminosity is now coupled to the mass - accretion rate ( @xmath44 ) in the following way . at each time step , the accretion luminosity is adjusted based on the history of the mass accretion rate through the inner boundary .",
    "however , since our inner boundary is rather large compare to @xmath16 , we introduce a lag time ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the lag time roughly corresponds to the accretion time scale for the gas to reach the bh from the inner boundary of our computational domain .",
    "this should naturally cause a self - regulation of mass - accretion rate and the amount of radiative feedback , i.e.  a higher mass accretion rate hence a higher accretion luminosity will more strongly push surrounding gas outward , and will naturally slow down the accretion process .",
    "the mass accretion rate of the bh with mass @xmath12 at a given time @xmath46 is @xmath47 , the accretion luminosity is given by    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the rest mass conversion efficiency , the gravitational constant , and the schwarzschild radius of the bh , respectively .",
    "the growth rate of black hole mass is negligible here in the time scale used in our simulation .",
    "we estimate the mass accretion rate at a given time @xmath46 by computing the time average of the mass inflow rate ( @xmath52 ) at the inner boundary as our simulation proceeds . if the time duration used for the averaging the mass accretion rate is @xmath53",
    ", then we can write the average mass accretion rate ( @xmath44 ) as    @xmath54    in our models we set @xmath55 , and the denominator simply becomes @xmath45 . in the ` standard '",
    "@xmath56 disc models , the accretion timescale ( @xmath57 ) or the lag time @xmath45 can be approximated as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath56 are the dynamical timescale at the outer radius ( @xmath60 ) of the disc and the @xmath56 viscosity parameter ( @xcite ) . in this paper , we assume @xmath61 cm and @xmath62 , which give @xmath63s , and consequently @xmath64  s ( see also @xcite for a similar treatment ) .",
    "note that the time scale for the free - falling gas ( @xmath65 ) to reach the centre from the inner boundary of our computational domain is approximately @xmath66  s which is same order of magnitude as the dynamical timescale mentioned above .",
    "for the models which has a steady state solutions , we find that the basic flow properties ( e.g.  morphology , mass - accretion rate , and gas temperature ) are rather insensitive to the value of @xmath45 .",
    "a caveat in the method described here is that we assume all the inflowing gas which crosses the inner boundary reaches the accretion disc and contributes to the accretion luminosity . in reality",
    ", some fraction of the gas which falls inward of the inner boundary may not reach the accretion disc due to , again , strong disc radiation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the following parameters are common to all the models presented here , and are exactly same as in papers  i , ii and iii .",
    "we assume that the central bh is non - rotating and has mass @xmath67 .",
    "the size of the disc inner radius is assumed to be @xmath68 . the rest mass conversion efficiency ( @xmath49 ) in equation  [ eq : lacc_time_dependet ]",
    "is assumed to be @xmath69 .",
    "the eddington luminosity of the schwarzschild bh , i.e.  @xmath70 for our system is about @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "the fractions of the luminosity in the uv ( @xmath73 ) and that in the x - ray ( @xmath74 ) are fixed at @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively , as in paper  i ( their run  c ) and in paper  ii ( their run  cr ) .",
    "these two parameters determine the shape of the underlying continuum emission of the central source ( cf .",
    "section  [ sub : hydrodynamics ] ) .",
    "the following ranges of the coordinates are adopted : @xmath77 , @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the radius of the central and spherical x - ray corona region @xmath16 coincides the inner radius of the the accretion disc . in our simulations",
    ", the polar angle range is divided into 64 zones , and are equally spaced . in the @xmath14 direction ,",
    "the gird is divided into 140 zones in which the zone size ratio is fixed at @xmath81 .",
    "for the initial conditions , the density and the temperature of gas are set uniformly , i.e.  @xmath82 and @xmath83 everywhere in the computational domain ( table  [ tab : model - summary ] ) .",
    "the initial velocity of the gas is assigned by assuming the same specific angular momentum distribution used in papers ii and iii . at the inner and outer boundaries ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 )",
    ", we apply the outflow ( free - to - outflow ) boundary conditions , in which the field values are extrapolated beyond the boundaries using the values of _ the ghost zones _ residing outside of normal computational zones ( see @xcite for more details ) . at @xmath84 ,",
    "all hd quantities are assigned to the initial conditions ( e.g.  @xmath83 and @xmath82 ) during the evolution of each model ; however , this outer boundary condition is applied only when the gas is inflowing at @xmath84 , i.e.  when @xmath85 .",
    "the radial component of the velocity is allowed to float ( unconstrained ) when @xmath86 at @xmath84 . in paper",
    "ii , we also applied these conditions to represent a steady flow condition at @xmath84 .",
    "we found that this technique leads to a solution that relaxes to a steady state in both spherical and non - spherical accretion with an outflow ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this imitates the condition in which a continuous supply of gas is available at @xmath84 .",
    "we also consider a several cases in which the temperature at @xmath84 is unconstrained ( section  [ sub : to_not_fixed ] ) .",
    "important reference physical quantities relevant to our systems are as follows .",
    "the compton radius , @xmath87 , is @xmath88 or equivalently @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the compton temperature , the mean molecular weight of gas and the proton mass , respectively .",

    "the escape velocity from the inner most radius ( @xmath79 ) of the computational domain is about @xmath100 .    [",

    "we have performed a set of 2-d ( axisymmetric ) hydrodynamical simulations ( table  [ tab : model - summary ] ) to study radiation - driven outflows from a central part ( @xmath103  pc ) of agn .",
    "we have extended the radiation - driven agn outflow model of @xcite by relaxing the assumption of a constant accretion luminosity .",
    "this allows us to determine the accretion luminosity consistently with the mass accretion rate at the inner boundary , and consequently the two quantities are coupled through the radiation field .",
    "therefore , we made another step toward a more comprehensive self - consistent hydrodynamical models with radiative feedback .",
    "we have examined the dependency of mass outflow rates on the accretion luminosity ( section  [ sub : mdot - l - relation ] ) for three different outer boundary temperatures ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106  k ) by varying the outer boundary density ( @xmath107 ) . in the following , we summarise our main findings .",
    "we found a relatively strong correlation between the mass outflow rates @xmath2 at the outer boundary ( @xmath84 ) and the eddington ratio @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mdotout_gamma ] ) . the outflows found in our models can be divided into three groups : 1 .",
    "thermally - driven winds , 2 .",
    "radiation - driven winds with a wide inflow , and 3 .",
    "radiation - driven wind with a narrow equatorial inflow ( disc - wind like solutions ) . out of 22 models considered here ,",
    "the majority of them ( 19 models ) produces radiation - driven outflow / winds ( groups  2 and 3 ) .",
    "only 3 models produce thermally driven winds ( grope  2 : models  15 , 16 and 17 ) .",
    "the thermally driven winds are found only in the highest temperature models ( @xmath108  k ) .",
    "the disc - wind like outflows are found in 4 cases ( group  3 : models  6 , 7 , 8 and 9 ) which all have the lowest temperature at @xmath84 ( @xmath104  k ) .",
    "no outflow is found for the models with @xmath109 when the ambient temperature is @xmath104  k , and for the models with @xmath110 when @xmath111  k.    for the models with radiation - driven outflows , we found that the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath11 can be described as a power law .",
    "the slope of the index of the power law ( @xmath4 ) is relatively insensitive to the outer boundary temperature @xmath112(table  [ tab : fit - summary ] ) . using the models from all three values of @xmath112 ( see above ) , the index of the power law is found as @xmath5 .",
    "this is very similar to those of the radiation - driven stellar wind ( e.g.  @xcite ) and disc wind ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) which predict @xmath113 .",
    "this confirms that a very similar power - law scaling of mass outflow rates with the luminosity of the continuum source works at extremely different mass regimes , namely @xmath114 ( cataclysmic variables ) , @xmath115 ( massive stars ) and @xmath116 ( agn ) , which also have different types of spectral energy distributions and the geometry of the radiation field .    as in papers",
    "i , ii , and iii , we find that the outflow is driven from an inflow . however , here we found cases of the inflow - outflow solution of an extreme form ( section  [ sub : disk - wind - like ] ) for the lowest outer boundary temperature models ( @xmath104  k ) but with relatively high outer boundary densities ( @xmath117 ) . in these models ,",
    "the inflow occur in a narrow zone near the equatorial plane which resembles a thin accretion disc , and the outflow occurs in a wide polar angles ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "this type of the flow is very similar to a wind driven by radiation from a luminous accretion disc ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our models ,",
    "the inflowing gas is very slowly rotating , so that the rotation velocity of the inflowing disc - like structure is much smaller than the keplerian velocity .",
    "the outflows arise from the disc - like structure near the equatorial plane in a wide range of the radii ( @xmath119 ) .    for the models with a relatively high density set at @xmath84 ,",
    "a system reaches a steady state at @xmath120 ( see table  [ tab : model - summary ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : mdotout_gamma ] ) .",
    "in other words , we find the models can still accrete matter even with a super - eddington luminosity ( up to @xmath121 ) .",
    "this is a multi - dimensional effect . in our axi - symmetric model , the radiation field or",
    "the strength of the radiation force is not spherically symmetric but has the @xmath122 dependency ( equation  [ eq : g_rad_continnum ] ) .",
    "this allows gas to accrete near the equatorial plane even with a super - eddington luminosity ( @xmath120 ) , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : g_rad_vs_g_gravity ] . based on this figure ,",
    "the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath11 ( for the radiation driven outflow cases ) is expected to continue up to @xmath123 ; however , we are not be able to confirm this due to numerical difficulties in handling very strong shocks that occur in the flows in the models with @xmath124 ( for @xmath111 and @xmath106  k models ) . in the range of @xmath11 values",
    "we have explored , we do not observe a complete shutdown of the accretion flow even at a super - eddington luminosity , which is expected in a spherically symmetric model .",
    "the accretion is still self - regulating , but not as a spherical model predicts .",
    "when we relax the assumption of a constant temperature at the outer boundary and self - consistently determine the temperatures there , the @xmath2@xmath11 relation becomes very similar to that of the models with the lowest outer boundary temperature , @xmath104  k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : to_test ] ) .",
    "the high accretion rate models ( @xmath125 ) show disc wind like solutions , as seen in the high accretion rate models with @xmath104  k ( section  [ sub : disk - wind - like ] ) .    the following is a list of some steps for our model that shall be considered in the future : ( i )  include the effect of scattered photons which might enhance heating of the cold equatorial inflow , ( ii )  adjust the continuum spectral energy distribution based on the mass and the luminosity of the system , and ( iii )  extend the computational domain up to a few 100  pc scale to capture the gas dynamics in the narrow line regions of agn , and ( iv )  include dust .    in addition",
    ", we shall incorporate the results from smaller scale simulations ( e.g.  disc - wind models by @xcite ) since not all the gas which accretes though our inner boundary ( which is relatively large i.e.  @xmath126  pc ) would reach the central smbh due to the wind from the accretion disc .",
