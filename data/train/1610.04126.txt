    "in the main text we have chosen a specific formalism to discuss electrodynamics in media .",
    "this formalism encodes all the interactions of the medium with the electromagnetic radiation in the field @xmath100 through only the response function @xmath101 @xcite , without the need to introduce the macroscopic field @xmath102 . in this framework",
    "we assess necessary or sufficient conditions for negative refraction . in this short section , building on the existing literature ,",
    "we briefly explain why this is the appropriate formalism to undergo the first principle analysis we perform in the main text , the relation between this formalism and more well - known formalisms in term of the macroscopic fields @xmath100 and @xmath102 , the limit to the local formalism in term of the traditional functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and we comment on some subtleties .",
    "the formalism for electrodynamics in media based on the response function @xmath101 is valid for any system @xcite in the linear response regime , without the need of any other specific assumption @xcite .",
    "it encodes , as special case , the usual local formalism in term of the fields @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath100 , @xmath102 and the electric permittivity @xmath0 and magnetic permeability @xmath2 , but it is much more general because it includes the spatial non - local effects disregarded in the local formalism @xcite .",
    "the @xmath87 formalism indeed reduces to the local formalism in the limit of small spatial non - locality and slowly varying fields .",
    "the possibility to write maxwell equations in media in term of a single additional macroscopic field @xmath100 , in addition to the the fields @xmath103 and @xmath104 , without introducing the field @xmath102 field is indeed quite well known @xcite . in the case of spatially homogeneous and isotropic invariant systems",
    "the relation between the two formalisms can be easily made explicit @xcite .",
    "indeed for spatial non - local media maxwell equations and the electromagnetic response of the medium can be equivalently written in term of the two vector fields @xmath105 , and @xmath102 , and the non - local scalar functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 : @xmath108 @xmath103 and @xmath109 @xmath102",
    ". these two non - local formalisms are actually completely equivalent @xcite . for spatially homogeneous and isotropic media",
    "the function @xmath101 depends only on two scalar functions : @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as explained in the main text .",
    "the formalism in term of @xmath29 and @xmath100 , described in the main text , translates the fundamental fact that all the interactions between the electromagnetic field and the matter , including both electric and magnetic effects , are only due to the electromagnetic current @xmath110",
    ". it indeed avoids to separate such effects in term of the two vectors : polarisation and the magnetisation , as instead done by the @xmath111 and @xmath112 formalism .",
    "instead @xmath29 are the only fundamental functions : they satisfy all the properties of response functions @xcite , they are well defined for all values of @xmath15 and @xmath36 , and they are actually simply real linear functions of the causal correlator of electromagnetic currents : the fundamental observable encoding all the interaction between matter and electromagnetism .",
    "such formalism is more appropriate and easier to handle in the case of time - varying fields . for time - varying fields the usual split of the current in term of polarisation and magnetisation vectors is indeed absolutely arbitrary @xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 formalism implies to formally fix the magnetisation to zero and define the current only in term of the time derivative of the polarisation vector .",
    "the consequence is that the magnetic effects are automatically encoded in the @xmath36 dependency of the dielectric tensor @xmath29 .",
    "the relations between the two formalisms goes as follow @xcite : @xmath113 even if @xmath29 are the most fundamental objects from a theory perspective , it is nevertheless worth to state that the formalism in term of @xmath106 and @xmath107 results to be more adapted to describe static or almost static fields ( that could be more cumbersome in term of @xmath29 ) .",
    "indeed maxwell equations allow to encode all the effects of a time varying magnetic field @xmath114 in the spatial variation of the transverse component of the electric field @xmath115 , in fourier : @xmath116 . from this equation",
    "it is however clear that the limit of small spatial non - locality , i.e. @xmath117 , and slowly varying fields , i.e. @xmath118 , should be performed at the same time to obtain a non zero magnetic field .",
    "this makes less straightforward to describe static magnetic fields in term of the @xmath29 , compared to the @xmath106 and @xmath107 formalism .",
    "even if the formalism in term of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , could appear more familiar to the reader it has instead some subtleties that are rarely stated in literature , and it is worth discussing here @xcite . clarifying these subtleties would probably make clearer why the @xmath29 formalism should be preferred for a first principles analysis . as explained in the main text",
    ", the causality of the system implies that @xmath29 satisfy the kramers - kronig relations , and the associated sum rules .",
    "in particular the sum rule for the imaginary part of @xmath29 , discussed in the main text , and the second equation in ( [ eq8 ] ) , imply the equation : @xmath119 this should be valid for any value of @xmath36 , and it implies that the imaginary part of @xmath107 has to change sign in the interval @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "this is in clear contrast with the case of @xmath29 , whose imaginary part is of definite sign for all frequencies ( and real positive @xmath36 ) , due to the passivity of the medium ( see the discussion in the main text ) .",
    "such apparently wired fact is a direct consequence of the causality of the system .",
    "both the formalism in term of @xmath29 , or the one in term of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , reduce to the usual local electrodynamics in term of the @xmath36 independent functions @xmath0 and @xmath2 in the limit of small spatial dispersion @xcite .",
    "however such limit can somehow be subtle for what concern the magnetic response . indeed in the local limit : @xmath123 , while it can be shown that the function @xmath107 assumes the meaning of the magnetic permeability @xmath2 only in the narrow frequency band around @xmath95 for small value ok @xmath36 @xcite . in this limit",
    "the resulting function satisfies all the usual properties of a response function @xcite , however such properties are in general not valid for the full set of frequencies . in particular it can be shown that the imaginary part of the function obtained taking naively the limit @xmath124 for @xmath122 should not have definite sign .",
    "this is once again a consequence of the causality of the system .",
    "nevertheless the resulting function is not interpretable as a magnetic permeability in that range of frequency .",
    "it should hence be clear that a first principles analysis of the response of a generic medium can not be performed in the local formalism due to two main limitations .",
    "the local formalism disregards spatial non - local effects that can become relevant for certain media or for certain range of parameters or frequencies .",
    "for example some well - known corrections to the local formalism , due to spatial non - locality , come from the microscopic structure of the medium as in the case of crystals , for short wave length , or due to long range coherent phenomena as for example for plasmas , conducting or hydrodynamic media , where such corrections are relevant also at low frequencies .",
    "the other limitation is that the function @xmath2 is a response function , and it actually describes the magnetic response of a medium , only for pretty limited set of frequencies @xcite around @xmath95 , and moreover it disguises in non - transparent way some weak spatial non - localities of the system . on the other hand in the spatially non - local formalism in term of @xmath29 these functions",
    "are well defined response functions for all frequencies and wave vectors .",
    "the local formalism results appropriate and better suited only for almost homogeneous and almost constant electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "in this section we briefly illustrate some explicit examples of spatial non - local electromagnetic responses relevant for phenomenological and experimental applications , and we discuss the effect of spatial non - locality on negative refraction for the associated media .",
    "the aim of this analysis is to provide some explicit and concrete examples for the general theoretical analysis performed in the main text .",
    "in particular we provide some analysis for the response function introduced in the main text ( see also equation ( [ eq29 ] ) here below ) in term of generic resonance , and in particular for the limits in which it describes well - known systems in literature .",
    "a general analysis and classification of electromagnetic responses for spatially non - local media is left for future investigations .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the transverse electric field and we consider the pretty general spatially non - local permittivity introduced in the main text : @xmath82 with @xmath83 , and @xmath84 real positive constants . as stated in the mail text , it can be easily check that ( [ eq29 ] ) is a good response function analytic in the complex upper half @xmath15 plane , and moreover its imaginary part is non - negative definite .",
    "it represents the response of a spatially non - local medium near a resonance .",
    "the function @xmath125 in ( [ eq29 ] ) reduces to two physically well understood cases for particular values of the parameters : the response of a charged viscous fluid ( like possibly electrons in certain metals @xcite ) , or the spatially non - local lorentz model used to describe the electromagnetic response of certain semiconductors near exciton - polariton resonance , as discussed for example in @xcite , see below .",
    "using @xmath125 in ( [ eq29 ] ) we are able to illustrate some main points of the analysis performed in the main text . in particular we can see explicitly that while spatially non - locality is a necessary condition for negative refraction , it is instead in general not a sufficient condition ( contrary to what happens for the special case of a @xmath65 spatial non - local corrections to the local case , as discussed in the main text ) . here",
    "below we provide examples of models where negative refraction is always present , models for which it is never present , and models where negative refraction appears only for certain values of the parameters of the medium , while it is absent for others .",
    "the strategy we will use is to start from local models , in which the @xmath65 dependency of the function ( [ eq29 ] ) is not present or very weak , and slowly increase the parameters corresponding to spatial non - locality : i.e. @xmath126 and @xmath127 in ( [ eq29 ] ) .      for the particular choice of parameters :",
    "@xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 , the model ( [ eq29 ] ) reduces to the response function of a viscous charged fluids in the presence of dissipation @xcite : @xmath132 such function can be used to discuss for example the response to the electromagnetic field of electrons in certain metals . in this case",
    ", the electrons correlation generates an effective viscosity , @xmath133 in equation ( [ eq30 ] ) , that hence induces the related spatial non - locality @xcite , while the lattice of positively charged atoms breaks translation invariance and it hence introduces an effective dissipation of the medium , represented by @xmath134 in equation ( [ eq30 ] ) .",
    "this encodes the non - conservation of electrons momentum at microscopic scale , due for example to the presence of a microscopic lattice .",
    "@xmath135 is the plasma frequency as discussed in the main text .    in the particular case of @xmath136 ,",
    "i.e. restoration of translation invariance at microscopic scale , the @xmath125 in ( [ eq30 ] ) reduces to the one of charged fluids in absence of impurities or lattice as it can be straightforward derived using navier - stokes plus maxwell equations . in this case",
    "it is possible to show that the medium has always two refractive indices , one of which is always negative for frequency below @xmath135 @xcite .",

    "<S> , negative refraction means that , in a certain range of frequencies , phase and group velocities have opposite directions . indeed , both the electromagnetic energy density and the poynting vector are well defined , the latter being simply the product of the electromagnetic energy density and the group velocity ( the group velocity equals the energy velocity , at least for media with weak spatial non - locality  @xcite ) . for local media </S>",
    "<S> , it has already been argued that negative refraction can not be observed in absence of dissipation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will now show that the same conclusion holds in the presence of spatial non - locality , namely , that for transverse waves , negative refraction is not possible in the frequency region of transparency of a medium .    in the transparency region </S>",
    "<S> one has @xmath41 , and the kramers - kronig relations involve standard integrations . deriving eq .   with respect to frequency  @xcite , and using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath42 } { d\\omega } \\geq 0\\ ] ] for all frequencies in the transparency region ( this is not the case in regions in which absorption can not be disregarded , where the dielectric function can satisfy @xmath43/d\\omega < 0 $ ] , known as anomalous dispersion ) . for transverse waves eq </S>",
    "<S> .   implies @xmath44=k^2c^2/\\omega^2=\\epsilon_{t}[\\omega , k(\\omega)]$ ] , with @xmath45 the transverse refractive index ,  and hence the dispersion relation @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse group velocity is defined as @xmath47^{-1}= c [ n_t+\\omega d n_t / d \\omega]^{-1}$ ] , while the phase velocity is @xmath48  @xcite . using eq .  , </S>",
    "<S> noticing that @xmath36 and @xmath45 are real functions of frequency , we obtain @xmath49 , or equivalently @xmath50 this implies that , as a consequence of causality , negative refraction for transverse waves is not possible in the transparency spectral region of a medium .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall now perform a general analysis of the conditions for negative refraction , including both dissipation and spatial non - locality . for non - transparent media , a consistent definition of concepts such as energy density , energy flux , or </S>",
    "<S> heat dissipation rate is out of reach ( see for example ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the group velocity does not define the direction of the energy flow . </S>",
    "<S> we have to find an alternative way to assess the direction of the energy flow based on the wave vector . to proceed , we use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq7 ] ) to obtain the dispersion relation @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> since we consider passive media , the direction of the energy flux is dictated by the direction of dissipation of energy , or equivalently of the damping of the wave amplitude , the latter being given by the sign of @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the phase velocity is given by @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> as a result , a general condition for negative refraction is the existence of frequencies @xmath15 such that  @xcite @xmath53\\cdot \\hbox{im } [ k(\\omega ) ] < 0 \\ , \\ ] ] meaning that the damping of the wave amplitude occurs in a direction opposite to the phase velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated previously that for both local and non - local media , negative refraction is not possible without dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> we shall now show that spatial non - locality itself is a necessary condition for negative refraction . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a dissipative medium for which spatial non - locality is assumed to be negligible . for transverse waves </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath54 and the dispersion relation eq .   </S>",
    "<S> simplifies into @xmath55 for convenience we choose to represent any complex number @xmath56 as @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 . due to </S>",
    "<S> eq .  , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 for real frequencies , and the phase @xmath61 must satisfy @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase of its square root then satisfies @xmath63 , and hence @xmath64 equation is clearly in contradiction with condition , and we are left with the conclusion that spatial non - locality and dissipation are necessary conditions for the existence of negative refraction . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first important result in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> although a related discussion can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , these necessary conditions have not been stated previously to our knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us note that the necessity of spatial non - locality also holds for longitudinal waves . indeed , in absence of spatial non - locality the longitudinal component of the electric field can not propagate , and hence can not exhibit negative refraction .    </S>",
    "<S> we now investigate the existence of a sufficient condition for negative refraction . for non - gyrotropic media , due to invariance under point </S>",
    "<S> reflection , the dielectric functions @xmath29 can be expanded in powers of @xmath65 in the form ( contributions with odd powers of @xmath36 are forbidden by symmetry ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the largest intrinsic characteristic length of the material ( _ e.g. _ the lattice constant for crystals , the mean free path of conduction electrons for metals , the debye screening length for plasmas , etc ) , and vanishes in local media . inserting eq .   into the sum rule , and imposing the validity of the resulting equation for any value of @xmath36 , we obtain the following set of equations : @xmath68 equations ( [ eq13 ] ) implies that for @xmath69 , the functions @xmath70 have to change sign in the interval @xmath71 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this apparently surprising result is a direct consequence of causality ( for further details see the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> also note that it is not in contradiction with eq .   since it only applies separately for each @xmath72 with @xmath73 , and i m @xmath74 , while eq .   </S>",
    "<S> implies that the imaginary part of the total sum ( [ eq12 ] ) ( for real @xmath36 ) is positive .    for transverse waves , and for isotropic and non - gyrotopic media </S>",
    "<S> , we shall now prove that the first non - local correction to the dielectric function gives a sufficient condition for the existence of negative refraction . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the dielectric function @xcite @xmath75 inserting eq .   into </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath76 where @xmath77^{-1}$ ] . from eq .   </S>",
    "<S> we have deduced that there exist frequencies @xmath15 such that @xmath78 , leading to @xmath79 . since @xmath80 , we can state that @xmath81 this condition on the phase of the vector amounts to showing that frequencies for which eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( defining negative refraction ) is satisfied necessarily exist . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a non - local medium , that can be represented as the most general first order correction ( allowed by symmetry ) to a local response eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , necessarily has a range of frequencies in which negative refraction is observed . </S>",
    "<S> this is the second important result in this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the necessary condition based on a generic @xmath65 correction to the local response model deserves two comments . </S>",
    "<S> first , applying the same analysis to longitudinal waves does not allow us to conclude on the existence of a sufficient condition for negative refraction in this case . </S>",
    "<S> second , we stress that while dissipation and spatial non - locality are necessary conditions , they are not in general sufficient conditions for negative refraction . for example , let us consider a non - local transverse dielectric function of the form @xmath82 representing the generic response of a spatially non - local ( isotropic , homogeneous and passive ) medium near a resonance , @xmath83 and @xmath84 being real positive constants . for particular choices of the parameters </S>",
    "<S> , it describes the response of charged viscous fluids ( _ e.g. _ electrons in certain metals @xcite ) , or the spatially non - local lorentz model ( _ e.g. _ exciton - polariton resonance for certain semiconductors @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> changing the values of the coefficients of the @xmath65 terms , one can switch from a negative refraction regime to a positive refraction regime at low frequencies , as previously shown for the electrons hydrodynamic model  @xcite ( more details and other examples are given in the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis therefore leads to the conclusion that spatial non - locality supports , but does not necessarily imply negative refraction  @xcite .    before concluding it is worth commenting on the relation between the formalism used in this letter and the more familiar local formalism </S>",
    "<S> the usual local analysis , in term of the dielectric function @xmath85 and a magnetic permeability @xmath86 is clearly included in the non - local formalism described in this letter in term of a single spatially non - local response function @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> it indeed emerges as a particular case in the limit @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the appendix ) . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , our result that spatial non - locality is a necessary condition for negative refraction translates into the well known fact that , in the local limit , to observe negative refraction it is necessary to have both @xmath90 and @xmath91 . the sufficient condition for negative refraction , usually stated in the local formalism in the form @xmath92 \\ , |\\mu(\\omega)|+$ ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath93 \\ , |\\epsilon(\\omega)| < 0 $ ] ( see _ e.g. _ refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) is consistent with ( although not implied by ) our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the sufficient condition of a @xmath65 non - local correction does not require any constraints on the general form of the non - local permittivity eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq16 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , one should not conclude that the theory described in this letter is a mere generalisation of a well - established approach . </S>",
    "<S> the use , in the first place , of a non - local description of the electrodynamic response is fundamental at least for three reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is important to note that the meaning of @xmath86 as a true response function [ with @xmath94 for passive media ] is only valid for very small @xmath36 _ and _ in a limited range of frequencies in the neighbourhood @xmath95  @xcite , see also the appendix . outside this range , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath86 looses its meaning of a magnetic permeability , and its imaginary part has in general an indefinite sign ( see the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is actually the reason behind the sufficient condition for negative refraction proven in this letter [ the function @xmath96 in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> can be understood as an effective permeability ] . </S>",
    "<S> second , the analysis based on a non - local dielectric function reveals that @xmath86 , even if apparently a local response , encodes ( some of ) the non - local effects to order @xmath65 initially included in the non - local dielectric function @xmath97 ( see the appendix for a proof ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the existence of a permeability @xmath98 , as a condition for negative refraction in the local approach , can be seen as a disguised residual of spatial non - locality . </S>",
    "<S> third , the local formalism , although appropriate for a phenomenological analysis of certain materials , can not be used for a first principles analysis of negative refraction on the full spectrum of frequencies , because of its limited range of validity around @xmath99 and @xmath89  @xcite . in the present letter we applied constraints coming essentially from causality [ except for eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq7 ] ) ] . in the local limit it is possible to include thermodynamical constraints as well , that are instead in general not valid in the non - local theory . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it has been indeed argued that thermodynamics forbids negative refraction in the local limit . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of thermodynamical considerations hence strengthen once more the need of non - local approach , and the fact that negative refraction is realised exactly outside the regime of applicability of the @xmath85 and @xmath86 formalism .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that negative refraction of electromagnetic waves is intrinsically related to both dissipation and spatial non - locality . </S>",
    "<S> their simultaneous presence is a necessary condition for negative refraction . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of the theory developed in this letter are manyfold . at the fundamental level </S>",
    "<S> , the analysis can be extended non - isotropic or non - homogeneous media , or to other kind of waves such as acoustic waves , for which the design of negative refraction materials is an active field as well . at a practical level , </S>",
    "<S> the results in this letter show that non locality should not be considered as a refinement of the existing theories , allowing one to improve in an incremental way the precision in the determination of the effective response functions of real materials . </S>",
    "<S> instead , any inverse procedure should include in the first place non locality , since its exclusion is fundamentally inconsistent , and can lead to uncontrollable systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our results open the way to a systematic classification of media with or without negative refraction , providing a clear connection between this phenomenon and the dynamical properties of materials , as already shown in the case of metals  @xcite .    </S>",
