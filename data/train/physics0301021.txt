    "derivations of the dynamical equations for a continuum under the influence of internal friction were first produced in the nineteenth century by phenomenological arguments in the works of navier , poisson and stokes .",
    "these `` navier  stokes '' equations contained coefficients of viscosity and heat conduction whose evaluation was not provided by the early phenomenology .",
    "it was not until maxwell s treatment of the problem through elementary kinetic theory that the dependences of these coefficients on the thermodynamical state variables began to be understood . when the need for a kinetic theoretical underpinning of the theory of the dissipative properties of fluids had become clearer",
    ", hilbert  @xcite developed approximate solutions of boltzmann s basic kinetic equation in terms of an expansion in the mean flight time of the particles constituting the fluid . finally , in the hands of chapman and of enskog",
    ", the derivation of the equations of fluid dynamics from the basic kinetic theory of gases took on the form that was most widely used throughout the last century .",
    "this theory , in the formal version that enskog developed , was summarized authoritatively in the book of chapman and cowling  @xcite , as well as by a number of later books  @xcite .",
    "though it was satisfying that the same equations came from phenomenology as from kinetic theory , there was also bad news : when the mean flight time is long , the descriptions of sound propagation and of shock wave structure from the navier  stokes  equations are not very good when compared to experiment  @xcite .",
    "this is one of the reasons that other approaches to the derivation of fluid dynamical theory have been sought over the years .",
    "the first approach was naturally to extend the hilbert development to higher order .",
    "this was achieved by burnett  @xcite , who went to second and third order in the expansions .",
    "however the form of burnett s equations that are conventionally employed are those that result when the euler equations have been introduced into them as chapman and cowling  @xcite did ( see the discussion by agarwal _",
    "et  al . _",
    "this may be the reason for the disappointing result that little or no improvement was found ( and with often unphysical consequences ) when the reduced burnett equations were used for situations when the mean flight time was not extremely small .",
    "the reason that going to higher order does not lead to any real improvement in the results obtained with the chapman ",
    "enskog  approach is probably that , as grad  @xcite and uhlenbeck and ford  @xcite have suggested , the hilbert expansion is asymptotic rather than convergent .",
    "since the chapman  enskog  procedure is a sort of iteration process , it would seem to be inappropriate for a series that is not convergent .",
    "that is , in the chapman ",
    "enskog  procedure , one uses results from the previous order to simplify the results in the current order and this has the effect of restricting the domain of validity of the approximation at any order .    to circumvent this limitation of the chapman ",
    "enskog  procedure , an alternate approach was suggested in which the recycling of lower order results was avoided  @xcite . in the case of the relaxation model of kinetic theory",
    "@xcite this extension of the procedures was straightforward to apply and the results were encouraging .",

    "planck type collision operator in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) not only was an improved description of the structures of shock waves over that from the navier  stokes  equations obtained , but also the phase speed of sound waves that emerged was in good agreement with experiment for all ratios of mean flight times to wave periods , unlike the navier  stokes  results . though the results for the damping of sound waves did not turn out as well , they were not bad for mean flight times below the sound period and they were better than the navier  stokes  results . at present",
    "though , it is unclear whether a continuum theory can do much better than this result for damping . perhaps a microscopic theory is required to do better , as stubbe  @xcite and sukhorukov and stubbe  @xcite suggest . here",
    "we further probe the continuum theory by going to higher order using the new approach .",
    "we consider a gas of @xmath0 identical particles of mass @xmath1 whose individual positions and velocities are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the distribution of the particles in the phase space with coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is represented by a swarm of representative points whose local density @xmath7 is defined such that the probable number of particles in the volume element @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "the fluid dynamical variables are defined in terms of moments of @xmath10 .",
    "the density and fluid velocity are @xmath11 and , with the peculiar velocity @xmath12 , we may define the temperature @xmath13 we seek equations for these quantities .",
    "interest has been focused on them because , as van kampen  @xcite has stressed , these are the macroscopic `` slow variables '' that emerge from boltzmann s theory .",
    "the particles obey hamiltonian dynamics and so the phase fluid flows incompressibly and satisfies an equation of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 and summation over repeated symbols is understood throughout this work . the quantity @xmath16 is the imposed external force per unit mass .    on the left of",
    ", we have the rate of change of @xmath10 resulting from the streaming of the representative points through phase space . on the right , we see the effects of the interactions of the particles with those in their surroundings",
    ". particles with velocity equal to @xmath3 have their velocities changed to some other values at a rate @xmath17 per unit volume while particles with other velocites are given the velocity @xmath3 at the rate @xmath18 . in strict equilibrium , @xmath10 has the value @xmath19 , which does not depend on @xmath2 or @xmath20",
    ". then the left side of   vanishes and we find that @xmath21 this expression recalls the kirchhoff ",
    "planck law of radiation theory and hints that radiative transfer theory is one source of inspiration for the relaxation model  @xcite .",
    "according to the description we adopt of the way the particles interact with each other , we may find @xmath19 either as a consequence of the vanishing of the interaction term or we may need to prescribe it . in either case , the choice of greatest interest is the maxwell ",
    "boltzmann  distribution @xmath22 where @xmath23 . in the case where the fluid variables are allowed to depend on space and time , the use of the maxwell ",
    "boltzmann  distribution for @xmath19 defines a local thermodynamic equilbirium .",
    "when we introduce   into the kinetic equation , with the understanding that @xmath19 represents only a local equilibrium , we get the relaxation model @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "we may then study the case of nonequilibrium , with @xmath10 and @xmath19 differing , by using the kinetic equation to follow the evolution of @xmath10 .",
    "alternatively , we may seek the coarser description of fluid dynamics in terms of the moments of the kinetic equation .",
    "given the definitions of the fluid variables and the expression of @xmath19 in terms of them , we obtain consistency between the two by imposing the matching conditions  ( * ? ? ? * and  369 ) , @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this ensures that the state variables in @xmath19 are the same ones that are given by the moments of @xmath10 .",
    "since we shall assume here that @xmath30 does not depend explicitly on @xmath31 , though it may depend on the state variables , the matching conditions are equivalent to the conservation of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "if we now multiply the kinetic equation by @xmath32 and integrate over velocity space , we obtain the fluid equations @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the pressure tensor and heat flux vector .",
    "the trace of the pressure tensor is @xmath35 where @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the gas constant and @xmath38 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "another useful quantity is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the specific heat at constant volume and @xmath41 is the ratio of specific heats ; @xmath42 in this work and @xmath43 .",
    "the expression for @xmath44 is that for the specific entropy of a perfect gas when @xmath45 is the pressure . on using the continuity equation and the equation of state , we see that @xmath46 we may then rewrite the heat equation   as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the unit tensor .",
    "this result motivates the introduction of a notation for the tensors of kinetic theory , namely that an @xmath49 over any tensor designates its trace while a circle over a tensor , say @xmath50 , signifies its symmetrized and traceless part , as in @xmath51 where the overtilde indicates a transpose .",
    "for example , we see from the definition of the stress tensor that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    to obtain determinate expressions for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we seek an approximation for @xmath10 . in what follows",
    "we describe a procedure for obtaining and using one .",
    "we begin with a standard expansion of @xmath10 in terms of @xmath56 : @xmath57 when we introduce @xmath58 ( no summation ) into the formulae for @xmath54 and @xmath55 we obtain contributions written as @xmath59 and @xmath60 which lead to @xmath61    at the lowest order , in which @xmath19 is the maxwell  boltzmann   distribution , we find that @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and so we have   and @xmath64 without the @xmath65 terms , these are the euler equations .    at the next order , we obtain the fluid equations found earlier @xcite ; these reduce to the standard navier ",
    "stokes  equations when @xmath56 becomes strictly infinitesimal . as these first - order developments are central to the current work we present them next ( section  [ sec : firstorder ] ) .",

    "this is really a matter that is related to the nature of the atomic interactions and does not seem to have a significant qualitative influence on the macroscopic results .",
    "however , the prandtl number , @xmath84 , given by the relaxation model is different from that predicted by the boltzmann model which is restricted to two - body interactions .",
    "( the prandtl number is the ratio of the viscosity times @xmath85 to the thermal conductivity . )",
    "experiments in noble gases give values for @xmath84 close to the value @xmath86 predicted by the boltzmann equation for a gas of hard spheres ; by contrast , the value unity is found with the relaxation model . in calculating macroscopic quantities with the relaxation model ,",
    "notably the stress tensor and energy flux , it is sometimes considered desirable to adjust the value of @xmath84 in the results to be @xmath86 . since there is more than one way to do this ,",
    "a systematic procedure seems called for , particularly when the lorentz force comes into play .",
    "woods  @xcite has given a prescription for introducing the desired value of the prandtl number that seems to work well , though it is more of a rule of thumb than a fully justified procedure .",
    "it has the advantage of providing a definite prescription that can be carried into higher order and it leads to agreement with results from the boltzmann equation for _ all _ of the numerical coefficients that appear in the higher moments obtained from the chapman ",
    "enskog  procedure in second order in @xmath30 .",
    "since this modification of the results can be retracted by setting @xmath87 , it is harmless and we shall introduce it .    in woods",
    "approach one introduces the prandtl number into the formulae for approximating @xmath10 rather than into the final fluid equations .",
    "the motivation for woods procedure is that the times of relaxation for momentum and energy are different @xcite so that he has suggested the use of different relaxation times depending on whether a term from @xmath10 enters the pressure tensor or the heat flux .",
    "terms with even powers in  @xmath88 contribute to the pressure tensor and are assigned a relaxation time  @xmath56 ; terms with odd powers in  @xmath88 contribute to the heat flux and are assigned a relaxation time  @xmath89 where @xmath84 is the prandtl number .",
    "therefore , we rewrite   as @xmath90 this way of adjusting the prandtl number differs from that in the first - order derivation of refs .",
    "@xcite and , for @xmath91 , it leads to agreement of our second - order theory with burnett s results  @xcite from the boltzmann equation if we discard terms of order @xmath92 ( see the appendix ) .    if the acceleration  @xmath16 is not a function of  @xmath3 , eq .",

    "if  @xmath16 is a polynomial in  @xmath3 , then we can still write  @xmath94 as a polynomial in  @xmath88 , possibly of higher order than cubic .",
    "an interesting instance of this arises when @xmath16 includes the lorentz force on charged particles .",

    "although the relaxation model is often regarded as linear , in much the same way that the analogous equation of radiative transfer is , it has to be recognized that @xmath19 depends on the moments of the full @xmath10 and so can not be considered as given @xmath103 . treating the problem as formally linear is possible because the feedback on the fluid variables from alterations in @xmath10 are forced to be consistent with the basic equations by the matching conditions  . in the present work ,",

    "we thus conclude that all the matching conditions are satisfied to the required order .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : firstorder ] , if the acceleration  @xmath16 does not depend on  @xmath3 ( except possibly for a magnetic term ) and  @xmath56 does not depend on  @xmath3 , then we can write  @xmath94 as a third degree polynomial in the components of  @xmath3 .",
    "finding the contributions of the first - order terms in @xmath10 to the pressure tensor and heat flux is then just a matter of inserting the solution   for  @xmath94 ( times @xmath30 ) into   and carrying out the resulting integrals , as indicated by  .",

    "that is , if we had used the zeroth - order results ( the euler equations ) to eliminate the time derivatives contained in  @xmath117 and  @xmath95 , we would have obtained the navier  stokes  equations , as in the chapman ",
    "enskog  method , though generally speaking this extra ( and unnecessary ) step is normally taken earlier in the development in the standard approach .",
    "our suggestion is that if one wants to simplify the expressions for @xmath118 and @xmath119 by eliminating the time derivatives , it is more accurate to use the current approximation for the equations of motion rather than a lower - order one .",
    "if this elimination is done iteratively , it shows that our expressions for the higher moments contain terms of all orders in @xmath30 .",
    "however , we have left the time derivatives as they appear in  @xmath117 and  @xmath120 [ eqs .   and  ] , and we shall simply work with the full system self - consistently when we illustrate a physical problem in section  [ sec : ultrasonic ] .",

    "it appears to be a common misconception that it is required to make the @xmath190 error in the trace of the pressure tensor vanish identically .",
    "however , we are perfectly at liberty to retain terms @xmath190 in a theory that is intended to be good to @xmath191 .",
    "indeed , we suggest that , in the present instance , it might even be desirable to retain the extra terms in @xmath186 .    in the approach described here , we have in the order @xmath0 , an approximation for the pressure tensor with an error of order @xmath192 , so that we may write @xmath193 .",
    "let us put this as @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the tensor we need to find to complete our approximation .",
    "when we take the trace of this equation , we find the requirement that @xmath196    iterative procedures like chapman ",
    "enskog  theory force the trace of @xmath195 to vanish exactly and , on that account , ( [ a ] ) can not be satisfied unless @xmath30 is truly infinitesimal .",
    "but , in our approach , ( [ a ] ) is not an embarrassment since it points a way to increase the domain of validity of our approximation .",
    "by making a suitable choice of @xmath195 we might cancel some of the remaining error in the trace of @xmath186 if we but knew how to arrange this .",
    "as we have observed , the expansion procedure offers a natural choice for @xmath195 and the problem is then to test its accuracy .    as in most physics problems ,",
    "we prefer to let the choice among the theories be made by the experiments , which do favor our approach over the standard chapman  enskogtreatment .",
    "indeed , with the prandtl number adjustment , our results from the relaxation model seem to be preferred to those from the boltzmann equation in the chapman ",
    "enskog  approach .",
    "we shall return to the discussion of our approach to the boltzmann equation in another place . here , we have remained in the relatively simple case of the relaxation model whose results seem as good as those with the boltzmann model once the prandtl number is adjusted ( see also the discussion of the so - called bgk ",
    "burnett equations in  @xcite ) .    in the study of ultrasound",
    ", the propagation speed we predict agrees well with the experimental findings at all knudsen numbers .",
    "however , our results for the damping of ultrasound are good ( as judged by experiment ) only for knudsen number up to order unity . since our second - order results are an improvement over the first order ones , we may hope for improvement as higher orders are achieved .",
    "but in practice , going to higher order than second would seem to be prohibitively complicated , even if the calculations could be performed .",
    "the problem is then what ought to be the approach to the damping of sound waves in the limit of very long mean flight times of particles .",
    "one clue is that for moderate knudsen numbers we have some negative damping for a small range of flight times .",
    "this is reminiscent of the instability found in the burnett equations and jin and slemrod  @xcite treat this problem with a regularization procedure that involves manipulation of high order terms , as rosenau has also done  @xcite .",
    "such procedures have also proved effective in problems of photon transport  @xcite .",
    "similar procedures may be used to ameliorate our equations and we shall return to that possibility elsewhere .",
    "but there is an interesting aspect to this .",
    "the various regularization procedures being introduced to improve the continuum equations generally involve the introduction of higher order terms . here , we are making a plea for first looking more carefully at the higher order terms that are discarded by standard procedures .",
    "however , we wish to conclude with mention of a final issue .",
    "stubbe  @xcite has argued that the dynamics of rarefied gases can not be well treated macroscopically and a that microscopic approach is needed as in the case of plasma physics where no macroscopic approach has produced landau damping  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it may be that a suitable resummation of the results of lower orders would resolve the issue . in any case",
    ", it appears that the study of the damping of ultrasound waves is going to involve serious complications .",
    "we are happy to acknowledge that some of the work reported here was carried out during our participation in the summer program in geophysical fluid dynamics at the woods hole oceanographic institution .",
    "j - lt thanks david maurer for pointing out a useful reference . eas thanks s. jin , m. slemrod and j. dufty for interesting discussions .",
    "[ bc][bc ]    , versus  @xmath183 .",
    "the phase speed is given in units of the adiabatic sound speed ,  @xmath184 .",
    "the first- and second - order dispersion relations of this paper ( with  @xmath91 ) are compared to navier  stokes , burnett , and the experiment of meyer and sessler  @xcite . ]    [ bc][bc ]    , but for the imaginary part of the inverse phase speed . ]",
    "as we have said , the chapman - enskog procedure eliminates terms of higher order than does the current procedure .",
    "this elimination can be performed at various stages and , when we eliminate those same terms from our equations , we recover the chapman - enskog type of results in the n  s and burnett levels of approximation .",
    "more surprsingly perhaps is that when we set the prandtl number to @xmath86 the same elimination of higher order terms gives us the burnett equations with exactly the same coefficients as is found with the boltzmann equation for hard spheres . here",
    ", we sketch this reduction .",
    "equations   contain terms in  @xmath117 and  @xmath95 , which are formally of order  @xmath56 .",
    "we may thus write @xmath197 and @xmath198 these are not the second - order pressure and heat flux of the burnett equation .",
    "to recover the burnett result , we need to expand to first order in  @xmath56 the  @xmath117 and  @xmath120 terms appearing in the first order pressure tensor and heat flux  .",
    "first we do this for  @xmath95 , which enters the heat flux in  . on inserting   in",
    "we find @xmath199 which can be expanded to give @xmath200 these terms , when multiplied by  @xmath201 and added to  , agree with the burnett expression for the second - order heat flux derived using a boltzmann collision operator ( after setting  @xmath91 ) .    now for  @xmath117 , which enters the pressure tensor in  . after inserting   in",
    "we obtain @xmath202 upon multiplying this by  @xmath203 , adding to  , and setting  @xmath91 , we recover the burnett expression for the second - order pressure tensor appropriate for the boltzmann collision operator . thus our full expressions for the pressure tensor and heat flux agree with burnett to second - order , as they must since both theories ( ours and burnett s ) are second - order expansions",
