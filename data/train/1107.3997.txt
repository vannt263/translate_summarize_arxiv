    "energy release in flares in solar active regions occurs over many orders of magnitude , from large flares to microflares with as low as a millionth the energy content of large flares .",
    "the latter are a and b _ goes _ class events , which occur more frequently than large flares with a negative power law distribution in number of flares as a function of energy release extending over many decades in energy @xcite , which suggests a common energy release mechanism .",
    "there are some features in common among flares of all sizes , such as radiation in multiple wavelength bands and similar x - ray light curves [ see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite for a review ] .",
    "however , observational differences also exist between small and large flares .",
    "large flares are associated with higher temperatures than small flares @xcite . also , weaker hard x - ray flares may have steeper spectra than more energetic ones @xcite .",
    "statistical studies of hard x - ray microflares have become more comprehensive since the launch of the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( _ rhessi _ ) satellite @xcite .",

    "a recent study @xcite used a new flare - finding technique to identify over 24,000 microflares from march 2002 - march 2007 .",
    "statistical analyses of the microflare properties were carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this large data set allows for unprecedented studies of flare properties .    here",
    ", we use this large data set to infer the electron density and the volumetric filling factor of the microflare loops in the _ rhessi _ data set .",
    "the volumetric filling factor is the fraction of the flare loop volume from which radiation is detected .",
    "while the filling factor is often thought of as a robust parameter for flare loops , it should be noted that its determination is potentially instrument- and resolution - dependent . a previous estimate of the density assumed the filling factor was unity @xcite .",
    "we use a cooling - time analysis [ see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ] , to argue that the volumetric filling factors of microflare loops may be considerably smaller than unity , implying densities considerably higher than the estimates from @xcite . the filling factors and densities we find are consistent with a previous study of two microflares observed with _ yohkoh _ @xcite .",

    "a thorough description of the observational data is given by @xcite and @xcite ; the details most salient for the present study are summarized here . the data set consists of all microflares observed with _ rhessi _ between march 2002 and march 2007 .",
    "the microflares were found to exclusively occur in active regions .",
    "the events were identified as local maxima in the count rate of 6 - 12 kev photons having the appropriate sign of the time rate of change of the count rate on either side of the maxima with signal - to - noise ratio sufficiently large .",
    "a total of 24,097 events were identified . of these , spectral fitting and imaging analysis was possible for 4,567 events , which allowed for a determination of the plasma parameters required for the present analysis , namely the microflare decay time @xmath2 , the emission measure @xmath3 , the temperature @xmath4 , and the loop length @xmath5 and width @xmath6 .",
    "histograms showing distributions of the parameters used in the present study are given in fig .",
    "[ fig - rawdata ] .",
    "these and all distributions use 45 equally sized bins .",
    "the decay time @xmath2 of the flare is determined from the flare finding algorithm @xcite , which employs a condition on the time derivative of the count rate to determine the end of the event .",
    "their distribution is shown in panel ( a ) ; the median value is 192 sec .",
    "the minimum decay time of any microflare in the present study is 4 sec .",
    "the emission measure @xmath3 ( assumed isothermal ) and temperature @xmath4 are determined from spectral fitting of _ rhessi _ hard x - ray data to a model assuming an isothermal plasma with a power law tail above 10 kev @xcite .",
    "the logarithm of @xmath3 is plotted in ( b ) , with the temperature in ( c ) .",

    "the uncertainty in @xmath3 was estimated as @xmath9 and the estimated ( statistical ) uncertainty in @xmath4 is less than @xmath10 @xcite .    finally , the physical size of the flare loops was estimated using visibility forward fitting , described by @xcite , which fits several gaussian sources along the curved loop to estimate the full - length @xmath5 and a central gaussian fwhm to provide a measure of the full - width @xmath6 of the flare loops .",
    "the volume is estimated as @xmath11 .",
    "distributions of @xmath12 and the logarithm of @xmath13 are plotted in panels ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) , respectively , with median values of @xmath14 cm , @xmath15 cm , and @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the estimated ( statistical ) uncertainty in @xmath5 and @xmath6 is @xmath18 , which is the standard deviation of repeated ( 100 ) fit attempts with the visibility amplitudes randomized within their statistical error each time @xcite .",
    "there are also systematic errors such as projection effects and the assumption of a circular cross - section of the loops which are not included in the estimate .",
    "another possible source of systematic error is that the observations are from particles which have considerably higher energy than the thermal background , so the determination of @xmath5 may be an underestimate of the overall size of the loop because of the absence of thermal particles in the data .",
    "the loop electron density @xmath19 was not measured , but can be estimated using the definition of the isothermal emission measure @xmath3 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a differential volume element and @xmath13 is the total volume of a flare loop . the simplest and most common way to estimate",
    "@xmath19 is to assume it is uniform over the volume , which implies @xmath22 this expression is correct if radiation can be detected from all electrons which are present in the loop , _ i.e. _ , the loop is assumed to be optically thin .",
    "if finite optical depth effects are present in a particular loop , then the observed x - ray flux from that loop does not include direct contributions from all electrons , so the actual density would be higher than the estimate in eq .",
    "( [ denraw ] ) . therefore , eq .",
    "( [ denraw ] ) provides a lower bound on @xmath19 .",
    "an improvement on this technique comes from defining the so - called filling factor @xmath23 . in terms of the filling factor , the characteristic loop electron density @xmath19 is @xmath24 since eq .",
    "( [ denraw ] ) gives a lower bound on @xmath19 , @xmath23 is a positive number between 0 and 1 .    here",
    ", estimates of the density will be tested using a cooling time analysis .",
    "similar analyses have been performed previously in many contexts @xcite .",
    "cooling time scales are estimated using a scaling analysis ( replacing derivatives by finite differences of characteristic scales ) of the hydrodynamic temperature equation for a compressible optically - thin plasma , @xmath25 where @xmath4 is the temperature , @xmath26 is the _ total _ plasma density , @xmath27 is the ratio of specific heats , @xmath28 is the bulk flow velocity , @xmath29 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath30 is the coefficient of thermal conductivity , @xmath31 is the radiative loss function for an optically thin plasma , and @xmath32 is the volumetric heating rate from external sources . here , we assume quasi - neutrality so that @xmath33 and that the plasma is an ideal gas with @xmath34 . comparing the left hand side to the radiative loss term gives a radiative decay time scale @xmath35 of @xmath36 comparing the left hand side to the conduction term gives a conductive decay time @xmath37 of @xmath38 where @xmath39 is half the length of the flare loop which is the distance from loop top to the solar surface .    the radiative loss function is usually taken as a piecewise continuous function controlled by different physics at different temperatures . for the temperatures of the flare plasmas in the present study [ @xmath40 8 - 20 mk from fig .",
    "[ fig - rawdata](c ) ] , the functional form of the radiative loss function is @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "for the thermal conductivity @xmath30 , we employ the temperature - dependent parallel spitzer thermal conductivity of @xmath42 @xcite , where the coefficient @xmath43 , the temperature is in kelvin , and @xmath44 is the coulomb logarithm with @xmath45 for a pure hydrogen plasma .",
    "this type of scaling analysis has been used previously to estimate cooling times of flare loops and determine which mechanism dominates the cooling , typically for large flares .",
    "early studies @xcite suggested conductive cooling is more efficient , but the effects of chromospheric evaporation slow it down @xcite . the role of radiation was studied @xcite , and for a while it was believed that radiation and conduction act comparably to cool flare loops @xcite because the predicted times from the scaling analysis were comparable to observed flare loop decay times @xmath2 . from the theoretical perspective , it is reasonable that these time scales are comparable due to the function of the chromosphere as a reservoir for the corona @xcite .    the observational and theoretical result that @xmath46 prompted authors to assume this relation to estimate parameters for stellar flares for which well - resolved optical data were not available @xcite . a recent study comparing predictions using this model to independently derived parameters ( @xmath47 ) of stellar loops found good agreement @xcite , lending credence to the validity of this assumption .",
    "however , caution must be used in interpreting the scaling analysis time scales as genuinely representative of the decay of flare loops .",
    "@xcite used simulations to suggest that conduction dominates early in time when the temperature is highest , followed by comparable contributions from radiation and conduction .",
    "@xcite used a model in which strictly conductive cooling occurred at early times before transitioning to radiative cooling at flare maximum because of chromospheric evaporation enhancing radiative cooling at late times .",
    "therefore , there need not be a single dominant mechanism throughout the duration of the event .",
    "another important issue is that the parameters that go into eqs .",
    "( [ rad ] ) and ( [ cond ] ) are tacitly assumed to be constant and uniform , but the temperature changes as the loop cools and thus the scaling results are not applicable to finding the time it takes to cool from one temperature to another @xcite .",
    "taking into account the change in temperature would require time integration @xcite .",
    "since the difference between actual cooling times and the scaling result can be significant , the scaling analysis time scales only indicate instantaneous time scales of cooling @xcite .",
    "the scaling analysis is on firmer theoretical footing at peak flare temperature . at peak temperature",
    ", the loop goes from being heated to cooling , so the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tempeq ] ) is zero instantaneously @xcite .",
    "ignoring the expansion term ( which is safe when flow speeds are subsonic ) and assuming that there is no external heating , the right - hand side implies that conduction balances radiation instantaneously at the temperature peak , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath48",
    "this is the same relation as before , but with a very different interpretation .",
    "for the purposes of the present study , we subscribe to the latter interpretation of expecting equality only at peak flare temperature rather than interpreting the scaling results as predictions for the actual decay time .",
    "( however , a relation to the decay time will be discussed in the following section . )",
    "thus , the cooling times are evaluated at the beginning of the cooling process .",
    "it is important to point out aspects left out of the present model that have been discussed in previous studies .",
    "the scaling analysis ignores pressure variation along the tube @xcite , radiative cooling at loop footpoints @xcite , chromospheric evaporation @xcite , shrinkage of loops @xcite , spatial nonuniformity @xcite , and the effect of multiple loops @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for an approach incorporating fractal dimensional filling of flare loops .",
    "a recent study emphasizes the role of enthalpy flux in flare loops @xcite .",
    "if any of these aspects of solar flare evolution play a significant role in determining the time - scales of flare decay , the results of the present paper could change in detail .",
    "the density estimates presented in @xcite employed eq .",

    "panels ( f ) and ( g ) show a scatter plot of the logarithm of the calculated cooling times compared to the logarithm of their decay times , showing that the time scales are essentially uncorrelated .",
    "panel ( d ) shows that the radiative cooling times are distributed around a peak about 100 times longer than @xmath2 , while panel ( e ) shows that the conductive cooling times are distributed around a peak almost 100 times smaller than @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath51 .",
    "this strongly contradicts the hypothesis in eq .",
    "( [ tauequal ] ) .",
    "note , this assessment assumes that it is reasonable to compare the measured decay time to instantaneous e - folding times from the scaling .",
    "since they may differ , this could introduce systematic errors in the comparison .",
    "however , we suspect that it is not enough to account for the large separation in scales inferred here .    assuming the plasma parameters we use ( including the density ) are correct , it is difficult to envision a physical explanation which could justify the disparity in time scales because one expects a flare to decay on a time - scale determined by the shortest available dissipation time .",
    "from this perspective , it is difficult to understand how , in the presence of strong conductive cooling , the actual decay time can be much longer than the conductive time - scale .",
    "a likely cause is the assumption that @xmath52 , which we now relax .    in order to address the four orders of magnitude disparity which appears to exist between the conductive and radiative decay times , we assume eq .",
    "( [ tauequal ] ) holds and use it to solve for the density and filling factor .",
    "we then check to see if this assumption helps us arrive at an internally consistent set of flare decay time scales . equating eqs .",
    "( [ rad ] ) and ( [ cond ] ) and solving for @xmath19 gives @xmath53 this is equivalent to the classical analysis of @xcite .",

    "this is reiterated in panel ( c ) , which is a scatter plot of @xmath35 and @xmath2 .",
    "the values do not appear to be correlated , but they are clearly of the same order .",
    "it is surprising that the scales of the cooling times are essentially equal to a key empirical time scale , @xmath2 ; nothing in the model requires that such a similarity should emerge from the analysis .",
    "of course , there are uncertainties associated with the comparison of observed decay times and predicted e - folding scaling times , but the present results lend observational support that a model with @xmath58 ( as has been often assumed before ) is consistent , at least for the present data set .",

    "[ sec - observations ] , the statistical errors in the length @xmath5 , emission measure @xmath3 , and temperature @xmath4 are approximately @xmath67 , and @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "standard error propagation techniques imply uncertainties for calculated cooling times of @xmath69 , densities @xmath70 , and filling factors @xmath69 , which are sizable but not unreasonably large .    a few potential sources of systematic errors have been noted .",
    "they include assuming that the measured decay time @xmath2 corresponds to an e - folding decay time from a scaling analysis , that the representative loop length is assumed to be equal to the values obtained by @xcite determined from particles at energies far above thermal energies , and that there is no external heating at the time of peak flare temperature .",
    "in this paper , _ rhessi _ microflare data are used to estimate the volumetric filling factor and the electron density of microflare loops using an analysis of cooling times .",
    "if the filling factor is assumed to be unity , then the conductive cooling time of the loop is much smaller than the observed decay time , which itself is much smaller than the radiative decay time .",
    "this is difficult to justify physically . alternately ,",
    "if one invokes the hypothesis that the radiative and conductive cooling times are comparable at the moment when the flare temperature passes through its maximum value ( and that cooling due to expansion and flare heating are negligible at that time ) , one can solve for the filling factor and density .",
    "mean values for the whole distribution are @xmath60 and @xmath71 .",
    "our weakest assumption is that flare heating stops at the peak time of hard x - rays .",
    "since the hard x - ray time profile is a convolution of heating and cooling , heating does not necessarily stop at the hard x - ray peak time .",
    "if heating is present during the decay , even at a low level , the cooling times could be longer than derived for the case without heating , and the filling factor could be larger than derived here .",
    "our estimate of mean densities are higher than those reported by @xcite .",

    ", they found densities between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , with filling factors between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the values in the two microflares studied by @xcite from _ yohkoh _ are in good agreement with results from the large _ rhessi _ data set studied here .",
    "we now compare the present results with observations of large flares .",
    "@xcite found @xmath76 and @xmath77 for an m - class flare , @xcite found @xmath78 and @xmath79 for a c - class flare , @xcite found @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the bastille day flare , @xcite found @xmath82 and @xmath72 for a c - class flare , and @xcite found @xmath83 and @xmath84 for x - class flares .",
    "other examples of filling factors include 0.3 in active region loops @xcite , 0.04 - 0.07 in coronal holes @xcite , and near unity in many coronal hole jets @xcite but 0.03 in another study @xcite .",
    "as noted earlier , the determination of filling factors can depend on detector resolution and wavelength .",
    "nonetheless , the filling factors obtained here for microflares are at least 10 times smaller than those reported for large flares , which is likely statistically significant .",
    "densities are slightly higher for microflares in the present study than for larger flares in previous studies .    given the characteristics of the microflare data set considered here compared to large flares , it is perhaps not surprising that the filling factors are small .",
    "the microflare loops in the present study occur in active regions , just as large flares do .",
    "the mean sizes of the loops in the present study are comparable to those of larger flares .",
    "the loops have energies of @xmath85 deposited into them by the flare ( using characteristic values from fig .",
    "[ fig - rawdata ] ) , which is about @xmath86 times smaller than large flares .",
    "thus , the loops are of similar size but acquire less energy , which could lead to a smaller filling factor . to estimate the size of the region for which radiation is detected , we note",
    "the radiating volume is @xmath87 . assuming that the length of the radiating plasma is @xmath5 , the effective width @xmath88 of the radiating plasma is given by @xmath89 . for the present parameters ,",
    "this implies loops with total thickness @xmath90 , which would imply there is an unseen substructure of thin strands within the flare loops .",
    "various lines of evidence indicate that there are smaller - scale structures in the corona , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "radio polarization data point to the existence of structures in the corona which are @xmath91 km in size @xcite .",
    "the possibility that 100 km structures are associated with collapsing magnetic reconnection sites in the corona was discussed by @xcite : using constraints on the collapse time - scales and coronal alfvn speeds , transverse dimensions of order 100 km were found to be typical of reconnection sites in the corona .",
    "more recently , there is evidence that x - class flare loops are composed of thin threads from high resolution observations , with structure at scales of a few arcseconds ( @xmath92 ) and below @xcite .",
    "there is also abundant evidence from the footpoints of flaring loops that most of the emission is spatially unresolved , such as in trace white - light flares @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a core region within a halo region in two x - class white - light flares , reporting a ratio of the area of the core to the halo of 4% and 25% , respectively .",
    "also , simulations of loops comprised of many small scale filaments were able to reproduce cooling characteristics of large flare loops observed with trace @xcite .",
    "thus , the conclusion that there is small substructure of flare loops is not without precedent .",
    "the prediction of small scale loops has implications for the heating mechanism of the flare loops . @xcite",
    "estimated that the non - thermal power in accelerated electrons during the time of peak emission in the _ rhessi _ microflares is @xmath93 . for loops of area @xmath94 as predicted by the present results , the energy deposition rate per unit area would be @xmath95 .",
    "this is an enormous value , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "hence , if the filling factor is indeed @xmath96 , then microflares are unlikely heated by electron beams . a recent model that the flare energy is transported by alfvn waves",
    "@xcite would not be ruled out by the data .",
    "an interesting result of",
    "the present study is that the conductive and radiative cooling times derived by assuming their equality at the time of maximum temperature are comparable to the observed microflare decay times .",
    "a possible ramification of this result is that it lends credence to the assumption that the conductive and radiative times are comparable to the decay time , @xmath97 .",
    "this is relevant to stellar flare studies in which plasma parameters were obtained under such assumptions @xcite . in addition , a previous study of stellar flares @xcite found results of this model are largely consistent with independently determined plasma parameters . if one believes that the scaling analysis cooling times actually represent physical cooling times for loops , the result suggests that conductive and radiative cooling act at comparable levels to cool flare loops , at least for the microflares in the present study .",

    "<S> we show that if the filling factor is assumed to be unity , the calculated conductive cooling times are much shorter than the observed flare decay times , which in turn are much shorter than the calculated radiative cooling times . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely unphysical , but the contradiction can be resolved by assuming the radiative and conductive cooling times are comparable , which is valid when the flare loop temperature is a maximum and when external heating can be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> we find that resultant radiative and conductive cooling times are comparable to observed decay times , which has been used as an assumption in some previous studies . the inferred electron densities have a mean value of @xmath0 and filling factors have a mean of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the filling factors are lower and densities are higher than previous estimates for large flares , but are similar to those found for two microflares by moore et al .  </S>",
