    "elko spinor fields are unexpected spin one - half matter fields endowed with mass dimension @xmath2 @xcite . since its recent theoretical discovery , it has attracted much attention , in part by the wide range of possibility opened by such peculiar matter fields in cosmology and physics @xcite and in part from the mathematical point of view @xcite .",

    "we also remark , for completeness , that the quantum field associated to the elko spinor is now better understood in the scope of very special relativity ( vsr ) framework @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is possible to describe , or construct , elko spinor fields as the spinor representation of @xmath3 subgroup of vsr @xcite . in this vein ,",
    "since @xmath3 is the largest subgroup of vsr encompassing all the necessary physical symmetries except some ( violated ) discrete symmetry , the tension between elko and lorentz symmetries disappears .    on the other hand",

    ". the lhc will provide center - of - mass energy enough to probe directly the weak scale and the origin of mass .",

    "the above considerations lead to an important result : if the cut applied on @xmath64 includes the intermediary elko propagation axis , the measured decay is lower than any other cut in which this specific direction is not included .",
    "therefore it breaks @xmath64 isotropy which is , obviously , fully observed in all standard model particles .",

    "can be obtained using the equation for @xmath121 ( see section iii ) and supposing the limit @xmath122 .",
    "one can expand the integrand , and proceed with the integration for the first term to obtain @xmath123 in the limit @xmath124 , and with all final state energies near to the elko mass , we obtain a lower bound to this values given by @xmath125 which shall be multiplied by the the cross section obtained numerically before .    for the elko production , on the simple decay @xmath126 and fixing the coupling constant at its maximum value ( @xmath127 ) as well as @xmath128 , we have @xmath129 . at the lhc , for a @xmath130 integrated luminosity , one should obtain a ratio @xmath131 around @xmath132 ( or actually one half of this value , taking account the angular asymmetry ) .",
    "however as the detection of this process signature depends on the coupling constant , since under a certain value it would be required a better angular resolution in the detector to distinguish the signal from the background . for an indirect search of elko particles via azimuthal angular asymmetry with @xmath133 process , using the angular resolution for the cms detector ( @xmath134 ) , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , the number of events decreases substantially to @xmath137 taking ( [ marit ] ) into account .",
    "hence , one can see that for this parameters eq .",
    "( [ artill ] ) gives a result which is clearly insufficient to claim a discovery at the lhc .",
    "the process on study has actually a dependency on @xmath138 , so the estimated minimum resolution for the @xmath139 case , maintaining @xmath140 , is @xmath141 .",
    "lower values of @xmath142 should require a better resolution on the detector .",
    "of course , for this rough estimate , none type of cuts was performed and a detailed study using a monte carlo simulation for the final state elko momenta would be in order .    the main motivation for this analysis is the possibility of elko detection in a range of parameters making possible to address elko as possible dark matter candidate .",
    "we now shall look at the following question : what should be the expected missing energy in the dimuon+jet system , if elko production is occurring taking into account the elko non - locality ? considering the proton - proton energy as @xmath143 in fig .",
    "[ evile6 ] we have the momentum configuration @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the invariant mass , for instance @xmath146 , as the sum of two momentum vectors , and @xmath147 .",
    "therefore the missing energy is @xmath148    an important requirement is imposed by the minimum energy resolution for the search of missing energy on this channel .",
    "considering the same parametrization as used for the cms detector @xcite , we suppose that the threshold for the missing energy for the signal is given by @xmath149 in the limit that the two elkos does not have a significant momenta , it is possible to approximate @xmath150 and , then , one should to select only events with @xmath151 .",
    "this means that a detailed analysis should take into account both , angular and energy , resolutions .",
    "by analyzing the consequences of the unusual elko propagator behavior , it was possible to derive a typical signature to the elko production , namely : due to the elko non locality , the measured decay depends on the angular cut applied , breaking therefore the angular isotropy ( fully observed in all standard model processes ) .",
    "we shall stress two important points : fig .",
    "[ evile5 ] may be understood as the first term of a sum involving internal elko productions of the same type ( a `` cascade '' of a `` fork '' ) , what means that its contribution can be improved by the sum of those graphs , faced as a finite geometric series on @xmath152 ; second , it should be stressed for completeness , that another factor resulting as an unexpected asymmetry on @xmath64 ( for graphs involving four elkos coupling ) arises from the inclusion of the @xmath153 and @xmath154 type propagators , which are proportional to @xmath155 and @xmath156 matrices , the `` twisted spin sums '' : @xmath157,\\nonumber\\\\ n(p^\\prime)&=&\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\\sqrt{p'^2+m_{\\varsigma}^2}&0&ip'sin(\\theta^\\prime)&-ie^{-i\\phi^\\prime}p'cos(\\theta^\\prime)\\\\0&\\sqrt{p'^2+m_{\\varsigma}^2}&-ie^{i\\phi^\\prime}p'cos(\\theta^\\prime)&-ip'sin(\\theta^\\prime)\\\\ip'sin(\\theta^\\prime)&-ie^{-i\\phi^\\prime}p'cos(\\theta^\\prime)&-\\sqrt{p'^2+m_{\\varsigma}^2}&0\\\\-ie^{i\\phi^\\prime}p'cos(\\theta^\\prime)&-ip'sin(\\theta^\\prime)&0&-\\sqrt{p'^2+m_{\\varsigma}^2}\\end{array}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]          c. g. boehmer , annalen phys . *",
