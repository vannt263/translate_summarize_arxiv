    "we readdress this problem and derive bounds for @xmath0 and @xmath1 that are much stronger than those obtained in previous analyses @xcite@xcite .",
    "a model - independent method of constraining the @xmath31 dependence of form factors using analyticity properties of qcd spectral functions and unitarity was proposed some time ago in refs .",
    "more recently , the same method was applied to the elastic form factor of the @xmath7 meson @xcite@xcite , which is related by heavy - quark symmetry to the isgur - wise function .",
    "the resulting bounds prove to be rather weak , however , due to the presence of the @xmath32 poles below the @xmath33 threshold .",
    "the lack of information about the residues of these poles , related to the unknown @xmath34 couplings , reduce considerably the constraining power of the method .",
    "the technique of treating , in an optimal way , poles with unknown residues is to multiply the form factor by specific functions in the complex @xmath31 plane ( the so - called blaschke factors ) with zeros at the positions of the poles , but with unit modulus along the physical cut .",
    "since these functions have modulus less than unity below the cut ( and in particular at the zero - recoil point ) , they weaken the bounds on the form factor .",
    "hence , the more poles there are below threshold , the weaker these bounds are . in a recent paper , boyd et al .  have applied this approach to the form factors of interest for @xmath35 decays , i.e.  to the matrix elements of flavour - changing heavy - quark currents @xcite .",
    "have been considered in refs .",
    "] however , once again the constraining power of the method is strongly reduced because of the presence of possible @xmath36 bound states below the threshold for @xmath37 production . up to now ,",
    "pseudoscalar @xmath4 and vector @xmath38 mesons have not been observed experimentally ; they are predicted , however , by potential models @xcite@xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in these model calculations weakens the derived constraints even further .    instead of relying on model - dependent predictions about the properties of @xmath39 mesons ,",
    "we adopt a different strategy : we identify a specific @xmath40 form factor , which does not receive contributions from the ground - state @xmath4 poles . by applying the method of refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite , we derive strong model - independent constraints on the slope and curvature of this form factor .",
    "heavy - quark symmetry is then used to relate the form factor to the function @xmath19 describing @xmath2 decays , and to translate the constraints into bounds for the charge radius @xmath30 and the convexity @xmath1 .",
    "these relations receive symmetry - breaking corrections , which can however be estimated .",
    "they turn out to weaken the bounds only softly , so that our constraints are stronger than those obtained in previous analyses .",
    "thus , our results should be used in future determinations of @xmath6 . at the end",
    ", we briefly consider the corresponding bounds on the form factor in the decay @xmath11 .",

    ", poles can appear at @xmath50 , and also branch points due to non - resonant states .",
    "their contribution to the form factors can be obtained using crossing symmetry and the unitarity relation @xmath51 where the sum is over all possible hadron states @xmath52 with the appropriate flavour quantum numbers .",

    "transitions receive pole contributions from ground - state pseudoscalar ( @xmath4 ) or vector ( @xmath38 ) mesons . ]",
    "the scalar form factor @xmath44 , however , does not couple to ground - state @xmath4 or @xmath38 mesons .",

    "we shall discuss these sub - threshold singularities below .",
    "assuming for the moment that their effect is negligible , the form factor @xmath44 can be considered a real analytic function in the complex @xmath31 plane except for the cut from @xmath49 to infinity .",
    "consider then the vacuum polarization tensor @xmath55 the invariant amplitudes @xmath56 and @xmath57 satisfy once - subtracted dispersion relations , so it is convenient to consider their first derivatives with respect to @xmath31 . applying a unitarity relation similar to ( [ unitsum ] ) to the corresponding spectral functions",
    ", we obtain the positivity conditions ( @xmath58 ) @xmath59 therefore , if we retain in the unitarity sum only the contribution of the two - particle state @xmath60 , we obtain rigorous lower bounds on the spectral functions . being interested in the form factor @xmath61",

    "the factor of @xmath65 appears since su@xmath66 light - flavour multiplets of heavy - meson states contribute with the same weight to the unitarity sum .",
    "below we will take @xmath67 to account for the breaking of flavour symmetry by the mass of the strange quark . using the above inequality in the dispersion relation @xmath68",
    "we obtain the inequality @xmath69 on the other hand , if @xmath70 , the quantity @xmath71 can be calculated using the operator product expansion . the leading - order expression is @xmath72 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the heavy - quark masses .",

    "the leading non - perturbative contribution is proportional to the gluon condensate and , for dimensional reasons , suppressed by four powers of a large mass scale . as in the case of qcd sum rules for the charmonium and bottomonium systems",
    "@xcite , this contribution is very small .",

    ", the resulting ellipse in the @xmath98@xmath99 plane is almost degenerate to a line , and to a good approximation @xmath108 it is remarkable that the parameters in this relation only depend on the meson masses and @xmath31 ; the dynamical information encoded in @xmath109 and @xmath97 does not enter here ( once these parameters are such that @xmath110 ) .",
    "let us comment , at this point , on an obvious extension of our approach . instead of ( [ phifeq ] )",
    ", one could write a more general inequality involving higher derivatives of the product @xmath111",
    ". this would further constrain the form factor near zero recoil .",
    "we refrain from presenting such an extension because of two approximations inherent in our treatment : first , sub - threshold singularities give an increasingly larger contribution to higher derivatives of @xmath112 ( see eq .",
    "( [ deltas ] ) below ) ; secondly , the relations among the form factors implied by heavy - quark symmetry , which will be used later to derive from our results bounds on the form factors of interest in semileptonic @xmath7 decays , are expected to break down for higher derivatives of the form factors .    for the numerical evaluation of the bounds , we first consider the case where @xmath73 , so that @xmath113 this leads to @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the only model - dependent quantity is the `` radius '' @xmath117 , which depends on the product @xmath118 .",
    "using @xmath119 for the ratio of the heavy - quark masses , as well as @xmath67 , we find @xmath120 . as discussed above , qcd corrections are expected to modify this result in a moderate way . moreover , in the heavy - quark limit we have ( including short - distance corrections ) @xmath121 @xcite , and corrections to this result are of order @xmath23 and should not exceed 10% .",
    "thus , we believe it is conservative to assume that the total uncertainty in the product @xmath118 is less than 30% . as our goal is to derive bounds , we take the smallest possible value , i.e.  @xmath122 , which leads to the largest value of @xmath117 and thus to the largest allowed domain in the @xmath98@xmath99 plane . with this choice , we obtain @xmath123 . according to ( [ interv ] ) , the allowed intervals for the slope and curvature",
    "are then given by @xmath124 and the approximate relation ( [ approx ] ) between the two parameters reads @xmath125 the corresponding narrow ellipse is shown by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipse ]",
    ". the allowed region can be reduced further by considering values @xmath126 ; however , the qcd calculation is reliable only if @xmath70 . as an example , we show by the dashed and dotted curves the two ellipses obtained for @xmath127 and 20  gev@xmath128 . the gain that can be achieved in this way is rather small , and to be conservative",
    "we shall take @xmath73 from now on .",
    "a last question that has to be discussed is the effect of possible sub - threshold singularities . these are due to states of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a light hadron , or to scalar @xmath4 resonances , which contribute to the unitarity sum in ( [ unitsum ] ) . because these scalar mesons are predicted to have masses that lie above the branch point due to two - particle intermediate states @xcite@xcite",
    ", we shall treat them as resonances in these two - particle channels .",
    "the lowest intermediate states in the unitarity relation for the form factor @xmath61 are then given by @xmath129 .",
    "however , these contributions are suppressed by isospin symmetry , so the lowest states which contribute significantly are @xmath130 .",
    "consequently , the sub - threshold cut is rather short .",

    "@xcite ) : @xmath131 where @xmath132 , and @xmath133 is a dimensionless quantity expected to be of order unity .",

    "appearing in @xmath135 are described by `` hair - pin diagrams '' . ]",
    "once an approximation of @xmath135 is adopted , the effect of sub - threshold singularities can be treated in an exact way @xcite . in this case , the function @xmath90 obtained after the conformal mapping ( [ mapp ] ) is no longer analytic . yet",
    ", the formalism presented above can be applied to the new function @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the position of the lowest sub - threshold branch point .",
    "we have used the fact that the function @xmath85 is real analytic inside the unit disc . by definition ,",
    "the function @xmath138 is analytic for @xmath79 , since the discontinuity of the product @xmath139 is compensated by the subtraction term . substituting ( [ gdef ] ) into the inequality ( [ phif0 ] ) , we obtain @xmath140 by performing a fourier expansion of the integrand , which contains now both positive- and negative - frequency fourier coefficients , and taking into account the orthogonality of these coefficients , we obtain , after a straightforward calculation , the following inequality instead of ( [ phifeq ] ) : @xmath141 ^ 2      + \\big [ ( \\phi\\,\\tilde f)'(0 ) - \\delta_1 \\big]^2      + { 1\\over 4}\\,\\big [ ( \\phi\\,\\tilde f)''(0 ) -",

    "numerically , we find that @xmath150 for @xmath133 of order unity , these corrections have a negligible effect on the bounds .",
    "note , in particular , that the parameter @xmath151 remains unchanged , and that the combination @xmath152 changes by only @xmath153 .",
    "thus , the approximate linear relation ( [ approx ] ) is essentially unaffected by sub - threshold singularities .",
    "our final task is to use heavy - quark symmetry to translate the bounds and constraints derived above into bounds for the slope and curvature of the form factor @xmath19 , which describes the recoil spectrum in the decay @xmath2 . our definition of the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 was such that they agree , in the heavy - quark limit , with the slope @xmath0 and the curvature @xmath1 of the physical form factor @xmath19 .",
    "differences are induced , however , by corrections that break the heavy - quark symmetry . in general , there are perturbative corrections of order @xmath154 , and power corrections of order @xmath155 .",
    "a calculation of the latter requires non - perturbative techniques such as lattice field theory ; this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
