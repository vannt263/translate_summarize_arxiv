    "human cancer is caused by the accumulation of genetic alternations in cells @xcite .",
    "finding driver genetic mutations , i.e. , mutations which confer growth advantage on the cells carrying them and have been positively selected during the evolution of the cancer and uncovering their temporal sequence have been central goals of cancer research the last decades @xcite . among the triumphs of cancer research stands the breakthrough work of vogelstein and his collaborators @xcite which provides significant insight into the evolution of colorectal cancer .",
    "specifically , the so - called `` vogelgram '' models colorectal tumorigenesis as a linear accumulation of certain genetic events .",
    "few years later , desper et al .",
    "@xcite considered more general evolutionary models compared to the `` vogelgram '' and presented one of the first theoretical approaches to the problem @xcite , the so - called _",
    "oncogenetic trees_. before we provide a description of oncogenetic trees which are the focus of our work , we would like to emphasize that since then a lot of research work has followed from several groups of researchers , influenced by the seminal work of desper et al .",
    "currently there exists a wealth of methods that infer evolutionary models from microarray - based data such as gene expression and array comparative genome hybridization ( acgh ) data : distance based oncogenetic trees @xcite , maximum likelihood oncogenetic trees @xcite , hidden variable oncogenetic trees @xcite , conjuctive bayesian networks @xcite and their extensions @xcite , mixture of trees @xcite .",
    "the interested reader is urged to read the surveys of attolini et al .",
    "@xcite and hainke et al . @xcite and",
    "the references therein on established progression modeling methods .",
    "furthermore , oncogenetic trees have successfully shed light into many types of cancer such as renal cancer @xcite , hepatic cancer @xcite and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas @xcite .",
    "an oncogenetic tree is a rooted directed tree .",
    "the root represents the state of tissue with no mutations .",
    "any other vertex @xmath0 represents a mutation .",
    "each edge represents a `` cause - and - effect '' relationships .",
    "specifically , for a mutation represented by vertex @xmath1 to occur , all the mutations corresponding to vertices that lie on the directed path from the root to @xmath1 must be present in the tumor . in other words , if two mutations @xmath2 are connected by an edge @xmath3 then @xmath1 can not occur if @xmath4 has not occured .",
    "the edges are labeled with probabilities .",
    "each tumor corresponds to a rooted subtree of the oncogenetic tree and the probability of occurence is determined as described by @xcite .",
    "desper et al .",
    "provide an algorithm that finds a likely oncogenetic tree that fits the observed data .    in this work we answer a fundamental question regarding oncogenetic trees .",
    "before we state the question , we introduce some notation first .",
    "let @xmath5 be a rooted tree on @xmath6 , i.e. , every vertex has in - degree at most one and there are no cycles , and let @xmath7 be the root of @xmath8 .",
    "given a finite family @xmath9 of sets of vertices , i.e. , @xmath10 for @xmath11 , where each @xmath12 is the vertex set of a @xmath13-rooted sub - tree of @xmath8 , what are the necessary and sufficient conditions , if any , which allow us to uniquely reconstruct @xmath8 ?",
    "in this work we treat this natural combinatorial question , namely :    _ `` when can we reconstruct an oncogenetic tree @xmath8 from a set family @xmath14 ? '' _    despite the fact that in practice acgh data tend to be noisy and consistent with more than one oncogenetic trees ,",
    "the question is nonetheless interesting and to the best of our knowledge remains open so far @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ thrm : thrm1 ] provides the necessary and sufficient conditions to uniquely reconstruct an oncogenetic tree .",
    "we write @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) to denote that @xmath4 is ( not ) a descendant of @xmath1 in @xmath8 .",
    "[ thrm : thrm1 ] let @xmath8 be an oncogenetic tree and @xmath9 be a finite family of sets of vertices , i.e. , @xmath10 for @xmath11 , where each @xmath12 is the vertex set of a @xmath13-rooted sub - tree of @xmath8 the necessary and sufficient conditions to uniquely reconstruct the tree @xmath8 from the family @xmath14 are the following :    1 .   for any two distinct vertices @xmath17 such that @xmath18 , there exists a set @xmath19 such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   for any two distinct vertices @xmath17 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 there exist sets @xmath24 such that @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in section",
    "[ sec : proof ] we prove theorem  [ thrm : thrm1 ] .",
    "it is worth noticing that our proof provides a simple procedure for the reconstruction as well .",
    "in the following we call a tree @xmath8 _ consistent _ with the family set @xmath14 if all sets @xmath19 are vertices of rooted sub - trees of @xmath8 .",
    "notice that when two or more trees are consistent with the input dataset @xmath14 , then we can not uniquely reconstruct @xmath8 .",
    "first we prove the necessity of conditions 1,2 and then their sufficiency to reconstruct @xmath8 .",
    "[ tab : tab1 ]    .illustration of necessity conditions of theorem  [ thrm : thrm1 ] . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the sake of contradiction , assume that condition 1 does not hold .",
    "therefore , there exists two vertices @xmath17 such that there exists no set @xmath27 that contains one of them .",
    "then , the two trees shown in figure 2(a ) are both consistent with @xmath14 .",
    "therefore we can not reconstruct @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , assume that condition 2 does not hold .",
    "specifically assume that for all @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , then @xmath26 too ( for the symmetric case the same argument holds ) .",
    "then , both trees in figure 2(b ) are consistent with @xmath14 and therefore @xmath8 is not reconstructable .",
    "the symmetric case follows by the same argument .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be the vertex set of the unique path from the root @xmath13 to @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 . also , define @xmath34 to be the intersection of all sets in the family @xmath14 that contain vertex @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "we prove that @xmath36 .",
    "since by the definition of an oncogenetic tree @xmath37 it suffices to show that @xmath38 .",
    "assume for the sake of contradiction that @xmath39 .",
    "then , there exists a vertex @xmath40 such that @xmath41 .",
    "we consider the following three cases .    since by definition each set @xmath19 is the vertex set of a rooted sub - tree of @xmath8 , @xmath42 by the definition of an oncogenetic tree .",
    "inductively by condition 1 , there exists @xmath19 such that @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 .    by condition 2",
    ", there exists @xmath19 such that @xmath20 and @xmath45 .",
    "hence , @xmath44 .    in all three cases",
    "above , we obtain a contradiction and therefore @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 and subsequently @xmath36 .",
    "given this fact , it is easy to reconstruct the tree @xmath8 .",
    "we sketch the algorithm : compute for each @xmath32 the set @xmath34 which is the unordered set of vertices of the unique path from @xmath13 to @xmath32 .",
    "the ordering of the vertices which results in finding the path @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath47 is computed using sets in @xmath14 which contain @xmath48 but not @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the existence of such sets is guaranteed by condition 1 .",
