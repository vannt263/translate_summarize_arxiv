    "the pulse profile of pulsar psr b1822 - 09 consists of three components : a  precursor \" ( pr ) , lagged by only @xmath1 by the main pulse ( mp ) , and an interpulse ( ip ) separated by some @xmath2 from the precursor . in fig 4b of gil , jessner , kijak , et al .",
    "( 1994 , hereafter gjk94 ) these components are located at phases @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and are referred to as the leading component of the mp ( called pr in this paper purely for a convenience of presentation ) , the trailing component of the mp , and the ip , respectively .",
    "gjk94 revealed a very peculiar and strong anticorrelation between the intensities of the pr and the ip : when the precursor enters nulling phase ( i.e. becomes undetectable in single pulses ) , the interpulse becomes visible in single pulses and vice - versa .",
    "this is dramatically illustrated in their fig .",
    "4a , which shows a sequence of sub - integrations consisting of 10 single pulses ( see also fig .  3 in fowler & wright 1982 ) .",
    "this behavior is impossible to explain within existing models .",
    "interpulses separated by nearly 180@xmath6 from the main pulses have traditionally been interpreted as the emission from a magnetic pole on the opposite side of a nearly orthogonal ( no ) rotator , i.e.  a pulsar with the dipole axis inclined at large angle @xmath7 with respect to the rotation axis e.g.  hankins & fowler ( 1986 ) .",
    "this idea is contradicted by the apparent transfer of information between the two poles .",
    "two other interpretations of interpulses assume a nearly aligned ( na ) geometry , with @xmath8 a few degrees . according to one of them , the observer s line - of - sight cuts through two sides of a narrow hollow beam ( lyne & manchester 1988 ) .",
    "this model seems excluded in b1822 - 09 because of a frequency independence of the mp - ip separation and the lack of extended bridge of emission between mp and ip . in the second version of na single pole ( sp ) model , the line - of - sight stays between two nested hollow conical beams during most of the pulse period ( gil 1983 ; gil , kijak & seiradakis 1993 ) . in this version of sp model the separation between mp and ip does not vary with frequency , but it predicts extended bridges of emission at all phases , which are not observed in b1822 - 09 .",
    "psr b1822 - 09 is therefore a peculiar case which seems to satisfy properties of nearly orthogonal double pole ( no - dp ) model in some aspects ( narrow profile components , no off - pulse emission components , frequency independence of the mp - ip separation ) as well as properties of nearly aligned single pole ( na - sp ) model ( mostly because of the apparent communication between the precursor of mp and the ip ) .",
    "thus , ( na - sp ) model seems to be preferred now in the literature ( e.g.  malov , malofeev , machabeli , et al .",
    "1997 ) , despite the apparent problem with lack of the observed bridge of the emission .",
    "however , one should mention that rankin ( 1990 , 1993 ) argued in favor of nearly orthogonal rotator for b1822 - 09 on independent grounds .    in this paper",
    "we propose an interpretation which , however nonorthodox , solves at the same time both major problems described above , that is the information transfer and the lack of the observed off - pulse emission .",
    "it also automatically explains why the separation between the precursor and the interpulse is close , but not equal to 180@xmath6 , as well as why the phenomenon _ seems _ to be so rare and/or unique .",
    "our model assumes that the three components in the pulse profile of b1822 - 09 originate from _ two _ separate regions in the pulsar magnetosphere , schematically marked as compact sources a and b in fig .",
    "the actual sources may be considerably extended in two directions , but nevertheless they may be perceived as the narrow components in the pulse profile . both the precursor and the interpulse are emitted from region a , whereas the main pulse ( mp ) is emitted from region b. the model requires that for this particular pulsar our line of sight is inclined at the angle @xmath9 close to @xmath10 with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "the crucial postulate of the model is that the precursor enters the nulling phase because the direction of radio emission from region a reverses by 180@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we can no longer see the precursor - instead we begin to see the backward emission from this same region a in a form of the interpulse separated from the precursor by roughly ( but not exactly ) half the rotation period ( fig 1 ) .",
    "because both pr and ip are emitted from a single emission region which somehow manages to reverse the radio emission direction , the information transfer problem does not arise at all . in principle , the model can work for both the nearly aligned , and for the nearly orthogonal rotator . in the na case , however , the radio emission region a would have to be located at very large altitudes to be detectable at @xmath11 [ if one assumes emission tangent to magnetic field lines and limited to the open field line region ( oflr ) , the altitude of region a should be @xmath12 . for lower , conventional emission altitudes from within the oflr , the model requires nearly orthogonal geometry ( fig 1 ) .",
    "this is because for small @xmath13 the impact angle @xmath14 is expected to be small , which means that @xmath15 .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the narrowness of the subpulses and with the lack of bridge ( or off - pulse ) emission in the profile of b1822 - 09 .",
    "the separation between pr and ip ( the latter of which is just a kind of  backward version \" of pr ) is _ not exactly _ equal to 180@xmath6 because of the effects of aberration and propagation time delays ( hereafter apt effects ) . since the backward emission has a large probability to pass through the region near the neutron star ( ns ) , the gravitational bending of light ( gbl , zhang & loeb 2004 ) and/or the refraction ( rfr , lyubarsky & petrova 1998 ) on the central region of dense plasma surrounding the neutron star ( michel 1991 ; melatos 1997 ) may also affect the phase at which we detect the precursor .",
    "the magnitude of these effects will depend on the relative arrangement of the observer , the source , and of the ns .",
    "in the limit of negligible gbl / rfr it can be easily shown that if the emission region a is located at distance @xmath16 from rotation axis , the interpulse ( or any backward component in general ) lags the precursor ( or the corresponding  directly viewed component \" ) by @xmath17 radians , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the light cylinder radius , and @xmath20 s is the rotation period of the pulsar . in the case of negligible gbl / rfr , it holds that @xmath21 , ie the directly viewed component is lagged by the backward component by _ more _ than half the rotation period .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that in the case of b1822 - 09 the precursor is the direct component because it is more pronounced than the ip . as we can see in fig 4 of gjk94 , the ip indeed lags pr by more than @xmath0 .    for b1822 - 09",
    "@xmath22 which implies that the emitting region a is at the distance @xmath23 cm from the rotation axis .",
    "since we know that the dipole inclination @xmath24 is large , we get an estimate of the radial distance @xmath25 for the emission region a : @xmath26 .",
    "more exactly , @xmath27 , which means that @xmath28 ( assuming that the radio emission from a does not extend far beyond the oflr ; for larger @xmath29 our line of sight would miss the beam ) .",
    "we can detect both the direct and the backward component from the same emission region only when @xmath30 which implies that @xmath31 .",
    "thus the model implies a nearly orthogonal ( or at least  highly inclined \" ) rotator with @xmath24 in the range between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the question arises what makes this object so special to exhibit this strange radio emission reversals .",
    "we argue that b1822 - 09 is not special at all , and that the phenomenon most probably occurs in other objects too . only in the  orthogonal viewing \" case , ( @xmath34 )",
    "do we have the chance to see both the direct and the backward component _ corresponding to the same emission region_. for @xmath35 we can only see one of them  either the direct one , or the backward one .",
    "so if the phenomenon is universal ( or at least not unique for b1822 - 09 ) we should observe spurious components in pulse profiles , which may be backward components emitted by regions which we do not observe directly .    because the phenomenon leads to appearance / disappearance of components in pulse profiles",
    ", it may be responsible not only for the mode changing but also for the nulling : the reversal of emission would be perceived as disappearance of emission for most viewing angles @xmath35 .",
    "it is important to note that if the magnetosphere of b1822@xmath3609 is symmetrical with respect to the magnetic equator , then the viewing angle @xmath9 can not be exactly equal to @xmath10 .",
    "otherwise we would have observed exactly the same emission pattern two times per one rotation period , which is not the case for b1822@xmath3609 .",
    "this problem can be remedied in at least two ways : 1 ) the emission from region a may have the shape of a fan extended in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "2 ) because of the gbl / rfr , we may be located at @xmath9 slightly different from @xmath10 , and still see the emission after a reversal ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "because of the gbl / rfr , the observer located at @xmath9 close to , but different than @xmath10 can miss emission from the other pole .",
    "the main issue which remains to be resolved is whether the apparent reversal is caused by the change of the _ emission _ direction , or just by the change of the _ propagation _ direction of radio waves .",
    "effects like refraction and reflection of radio waves are widely considered as a natural phenomenon in pulsar magnetosphere ( eg .",
    "lyubarsky & petrova 1998 ; petrova 2000 ; fussell & luo 2004 ) .",
    "reflections of the radio waves by an intermittent plasma flow could possibly explain the peculiar mode changes of b1822@xmath3609 .",
    "however , a reflection by @xmath0 is a special phenomenon , which requires fine tuning of the propagation direction and the orientation of the reflecting surface .",
    "it is more natural to assume that the @xmath0 flip is an intrinsic feature of the emission mechanism itself .",
    "another important issue is that our interpretation implicitly _ assumes _ that the jump of pr to the location of ip is caused by a @xmath37 flip of emission directon .",
    "this is obviously not a unique way to produce an interpulse .",
    "any change of emission direction from @xmath38 to @xmath39 would result in an interpulse .",
    "however , such scenario requires that not only the observer must be located at appropriate viewing angle , but also the angle between the new and old emission direction must be equal to @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-flip is most natural from a purely geometrical point of view .",
    "the observed reversal is then an intrinsic property of the emission region , ie .",
    "the bulk of radiation is emitted into the opposite direction after the reversal .",
    "the case of b1822 - 09 strongly suggests that a physical mechanism of the coherent radio emission operates as a two - directional source , which intermittently changes the direction of bulk emission .",
    "as long as only one emission region is considered , the phenomenon can have two principal observational consequences : 1 ) for @xmath9 close to @xmath10 it results in  false interpulsars \" , ie .",
    "objects like b1822@xmath3609 , with interpulses being barely  backward images \" of other pulse components . for low emission altitudes",
    "this requires that inner parts of the magnetosphere are transparent for the radio waves .",
    "2 ) in the other cases ( @xmath35 ) , the emission reversal manifests itself as a null .",
    "most importantly , the reversal interpretation implies that radio waves in pulsar magnetosphere are sent _ inward _ , towards the neutron star .",
    "this implication has a large number of consequences for physical , morphological and geometrical studies of pulsars , which so far have assumed the outward emission only .",
    "the inward emission hypothesis is elaborated and successfully confronted with the observational data in dyks et al .",
