    "the kaon , as quark - antiquark bound states , is one appropriate system to study aspects of qcd at low and intermediate energy regions . by using quantum field theory at the light - front",
    "the subnuclear structure can be more easily studied  @xcite . within the light - front framework and an appropriate choice of the frame",
    ", it is possible to obtain the pion electromagnetic form factor at both space- and time - like regimes@xcite . using the light - cone components @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the kaon electromagnetic current",
    ", one can obtain the corresponding form factors in the light - front formalism , with a pseudoscalar coupling for the quarks and considering the breit frame ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 )  @xcite . in the case of @xmath4",
    "there is no pair term contribution in the breit frame .",
    "however , for the @xmath5 component of the electromagnetic current , the pair term contribution is different from zero and necessary to preserve the rotational symmetry of the current .    in the next section",
    ", we outline the main equations of the model for the kaon electromagnetic current , detailed in @xcite , with the corresponding results obtained for the kaon elastic form factor . in section 3 ,",
    "we briefly review a qcd inspired model , presenting results for the weak decay pseudoscalar constants compared to data . in section 4 we present our conclusions .",
    "the initial light - front wave function considered in the present model is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a normalization constant , @xmath8 is the quark or antiquark index with @xmath9 is the corresponding quark mass , @xmath10 is the kaon mass , @xmath11 is the momentum fraction , and @xmath12 with the free quark - mass operator given by @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is a mass constant chosen to regularize the triangle diagram . for the corresponding final wave - functions , @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ", we just need to exchange @xmath17 in ( [ fupi ] ) and ( [ fupi2 ] ) .",
    "the relation between the electromagnetic current @xmath18 and the space - like kaon electromagnetic form factor @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 in terms of the initial @xmath21 and final @xmath22 light - front wave functions , we have @xmath23 \\   \\ , \\label{form}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the color number , @xmath25 is the coupling constant , @xmath26 is the charge of quark @xmath27 , and @xmath28\\right|_{k_-=\\bar{k}^{-}}.\\;$ ] in the light - front approach , beside the valence contribution , we have also the non - valence contributions to the currents . in the case of the @xmath29 component , the non - valence component does not contribute to the corresponding matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the kaon electromagnetic form factor obtained with @xmath30 is the sum of two contributions from quark and antiquark currents : @xmath31 in the case that we consider the @xmath32 component , to obtain the kaon electromagnetic form factor , after considering the contribution from the interval @xmath33 ( interval i ) , we need to add a second contribution , which is originated from the pair terms , and non - zero in the interval @xmath34 ( interval ii ) . the contribution is obtained after a cauchy integral in @xmath35 is performed in the limit @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "so , instead of ( [ fplus ] ) , we will have : @xmath37_{(i)}+ \\left[f^{-}(q^2)\\right]_{(ii)},\\ ] ] normalized by the charge conservation to @xmath38    the parameters of the model are the constituent quark masses , @xmath39 220 mev , @xmath40 419 mev and the regulator mass @xmath41946 mev , adjusted to fit the electromagnetic radius of the kaon .",
    "the electromagnetic radius is related to the corresponding form factor , with the mean - square - radius given by @xmath42_{q^2=0}.\\ ] ] with the parameters adjusted as given above , we have @xmath43 0.354 @xmath44 , which is very close to the experimental value @xmath45 0.340 @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "our results for the kaon electromagnetic form factor are presented in fig .  1 , in comparison with available experimental data  @xcite .",
    "we observe that the full kaon electromagnetic form factor is covariant only after the inclusion of the pair terms or non - valence contribution to the @xmath46 component of the electromagnetic current .",
    "next , we briefly review the calculation of the pseudoscalar constants , in a light - front qcd - inspired dynamical model . in this case , the constituent quark masses need to be readjusted in view of the fact that , differently from the approach outlined in section 2 , the wave - function is obtained from an eigenvalue equation , as follows .",
    "the valence wave function is obtained by solving an eigenvalue equation for the effective square mass operator @xmath47  @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the free square mass operator in the meson rest frame , @xmath50 are the constituent quark masses , @xmath51 gives the strength of the coulomb - like interaction .",
    "@xmath52 is the model form factor , with @xmath53 the strength of the separable interaction .",
    "we consider two expressions for the form factors : @xmath54 where the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath53 are adjusted to reproduce the experimental values of the pion electromagnetic radius and mass , @xmath56 . for @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 and @xmath59 . @xmath60 . in table  1 , we have the results compared with experimental data  @xcite",
