    "one exciting aspect of dense stellar systems is the simultaneous importance of three principal areas of stellar astrophysics : dynamics , evolution , and hydrodynamics .",
    "many simulation codes focus on one of these areas and have often been lifelong works in progress .",
    "the first attempts at unifying these treatments into a coherent model to describe clusters have begun only recently . in june 2002 ,",
    "specialists in stellar dynamics , stellar evolution , hydrodynamics , cluster observation , visualization , and computer science gathered at the american museum of natural history in new york city to begin discussing a framework for modelling dense stellar systems , without having to modify existing stellar codes extensively .",
    "the workshop - style meeting , organized by p.  hut and m.  shara , became known as modest-1 @xcite .",
    "the second such meeting , modest-2 , was organized by s.  portegies zwart and p.  hut and held in december 2002 at the anton pannekoek institute in amsterdam @xcite . from modest-2 ,",
    "a set of eight `` working groups '' were established , each focusing on a different aspect of the modest endeavour . attempting to integrate stellar dynamics , evolution , and hydrodynamics codes into one fully functional package",
    "will be challenging , largely because each area treats stellar properties that evolve on different time - scales .",
    "however , by combining these areas , we will be able to better model the origins , dynamics , evolution , and death of globular clusters , galactic nuclei , and other dense stellar systems .    in this paper ,",
    "our focus is on modelling hydrodynamic interactions between stars .",
    "the goal is to develop a software module for quickly generating collision product models , ultimately for any type of stellar collision , that could be incorporated into simulations of dense star clusters .",
    "@xcite presented an appropriate formulation for treating parabolic single - single star collisions between low - mass main - sequence stars . here",
    "we extend that study to include situations in which one of the parent stars is itself a thermally _ un_relaxed collision product .",
    "such scenarios can occur during binary - single or binary - binary interactions , when the time between collisions is much less than the thermal relaxation time - scale .",
    "stellar collisions and mergers can strongly affect the overall energy budget of a cluster and even alter the timing of important dynamical phases such as core collapse .",
    "furthermore , hydrodynamic interactions are believed to produce a number of non - canonical objects , including blue stragglers , low - mass x - ray binaries , recycled pulsars , double neutron star systems , cataclysmic variables , and contact binaries .",
    "such stars and systems are among the most challenging to model , but they are also among the most interesting observational markers .",
    "blue stragglers , for example , exist on an extension of the main - sequence , but beyond the turnoff point .",
    "blue stragglers are therefore appropriately named , as they are more blue than the remaining ordinary main - sequence stars , and , compared to other stars of similar mass , are straggling behind in their evolution .",
    "this aberration from the common path of stellar evolution is believed to be due to mass transfer or merger in a binary system , or from the direct collision of two or more main - sequence stars ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "predicting the numbers , distributions , and other observable characteristics of stellar exotica will be essential for detailed comparisons with observations .",
    "stellar dynamics codes determine the motions of stars .",
    "the primary approaches to evolving clusters or galactic nuclei dynamically are direct n - body integrations , solving the fokker - planck equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , monte carlo approaches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and gaseous models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for a review of the ongoing nbody effort for accurate n - body simulations , see @xcite ; for a general review of cluster dynamics , see and @xcite .",
    "the most important quantities that a stellar evolution software module can provide to a dynamics module are the stellar masses , as well as the stellar radii if collisions are included .",
    "at least in principle , these results could come from a live ( i.e. , concurrent with the cluster dynamics ) stellar evolution calculation , from fitting formulae , or from interpolation among prior calculations .",
    "due to the large number of stars , it would be wasteful to expend a considerable amount of time for a live computation of each star s evolution . for the ordinary stars",
    "whose evolution is not perturbed by an event such as a collision , it is much more efficient and entirely appropriate to interpolate among , or to use analytic fitting formulae based upon , previously calculated evolutionary tracks . the parameter space associated with non - canonical stars , however , is too enormous to be adequately covered by interpolation or fitting formulae , and it will ultimately be necessary to invoke a full stellar evolution calculation in parallel with the stellar dynamics for such stars . although live stellar evolution calculations have not yet been combined with stellar dynamics codes , some parametrized codes , such as seba @xcite , sse @xcite and bse @xcite , have been successfully integrated .",
    "when physical collisions between stars are modelled in a cluster calculation or a scattering experiment , it is usually done using a method known as `` sticky particles , '' in which a collision product is given a mass equal to the combined mass of the two parent stars and a velocity determined by momentum conservation . in a collision between two main - sequence stars , for example , the result would be modelled as a rejuvenated , thermally relaxed main - sequence star .",
    "this simple method is a reasonable first approximation for many situations .",
    "however , there are important characteristics of collision products that are neglected , including their rapid rotation , peculiar composition profiles , and enhanced sizes due to shock heating .",
    "if the thermal relaxation time - scale of the collision product is much less than the time until its next collision , then it is appropriate to assume the product becomes instantaneously thermally relaxed , as is done in the classic simulations of @xcite .",
    "this approximation becomes questionable when the collision has been mediated by a binary , as there is then at least one star in the immediate vicinity of the collision product and the likelihood of a subsequent collision will depend sensitively on the product s thermally _ un_relaxed size .",
    "binaries are subject to enhanced collision rates for two primary reasons : ( 1 ) their collision cross section depends on the semi - major axis of the orbit , as opposed to the radius of a single star , and ( 2 ) due to mass segregation , binaries tend to be found in the core of the cluster , the densest and most active region . in clusters with a binary fraction exceeding about 20 per cent , binary - binary collisions are expected to occur more frequently than single - single and binary - single collisions combined @xcite .",
    "it is probably not uncommon for binary fractions to be this large : the inner core of ngc 6752 , for example , is thought to have a binary fraction in the range 1538 per cent @xcite .",
    "binary populations can lead to complex and chaotic resonant interactions .",
    "these interactions tend to exchange energy between the binaries and the other stars in the cluster , and therefore are critical in determining its dynamics and observable characteristics @xcite .",
    "a star intruding on a binary could , depending on parameters such as the separation of the binary and the velocity of the incoming star , escape to infinity , destroy the binary , form a new binary with a star from the original , or form a triple .",
    "the outcomes of three body encounters can be categorized using a nomenclature based upon typical atomic processes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* who introduced the use of terms like  ionization  and  exchange ,  to describe resultant scenarios ) .",
    "see @xcite for an informative narration of the intimate interactions , usually involving binaries , that stars regularly undergo during cluster evolution .",
    "the starlab computing environment is a very useful tool for modelling and analyzing all types of stellar phenomena .",
    "the general technique for using starlab to determine the cross sections or branching ratios for the various outcomes of binary interactions is presented by @xcite .",
    "they also highlight an example set of cases in which a @xmath1 star intrudes upon a binary with a @xmath2 primary and a @xmath3 secondary .",
    "their assumed mass radius relation , @xmath4 , is appropriate for thermally relaxed main sequence stars and is applied both to the parent stars and any collision products .",
    "they find that for binaries with semimajor axes of 0.2 , 0.1 , 0.05 , and 0.02 au , triple - star mergers comprise about 1 , 2 , 5 , and 15 per cent , respectively , of all merger events .",
    "as the results of the present paper will help show , we expect that accounting for the enhanced , thermally unrelaxed size of the first collision product will greatly increase these percentages as well as the range of semimajor axes in which triple - star mergers are significant .",
    "simulations of moderately dense galactic nuclei initially containing solar - mass main - sequence stars demonstrate that runaway mergers can readily produce stars with masses @xmath5 .",
    "these massive stars then undergo further mergers to produce seed black holes with masses as large as @xmath6 @xcite",
    ". this process may be responsible for massive black holes at the centres of most galaxies , including our own . for star clusters , recent n - body simulations",
    "reveal that runaway mergers can lead to the creation of central black holes within a few million years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the help of monte carlo simulations , @xcite",
    "show that the runaway process will occur in a typical cluster with a relaxation timescale less than about 30 myr .",
    "observational evidence for a possible intermediate - mass black hole in m15 has been recently reported by @xcite , although the data is more reasonably modelled with a large concentration of stellar - mass compact objects @xcite .      mass loss and expansion due to shock heating when two stars collide are examples of hydrodynamical processes that can ultimately affect the future evolution of the cluster . mostly using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph , see  [ sph ] ) method , numerous scenarios of stellar collisions and mergers have been simulated in recent years , including collisions between two main - sequence stars @xcite , collisions between a giant star and compact object @xcite , and common envelope systems @xcite .",
    "the first published sph calculations of three - body encounters were done by @xcite , who performed over 100 very low resolution simulations and implemented a mass - radius relation appropriate for white dwarfs . other three- and four - body interaction simulations include binary - binary encounters among @xmath7 polytropes @xcite as well as neutron star ",
    "main - sequence binary encounters with a neutron star , main - sequence or white dwarf intruder @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for more information concerning the use of sph in stellar collisions , and see @xcite for a qualitative overview of the progress in stellar collision research .",
    "if the structure and composition profiles of colliding stars were available ( perhaps from a live stellar evolution calculation ) during a cluster simulation , then the sticky particle method could be replaced by a more detailed hydrodynamics module .",
    "sph calculations could then , at least in principle , be run on demand within this cluster simulation in order to determine the orbital trajectory of the product(s ) , as well as their structure and chemical composition distributions .",
    "however , at least @xmath8 sph fluid particles may be necessary to allow an accurate treatment of the subsequent evolution of collision products @xcite .",
    "the trouble , therefore , is that the integration of just a single interaction could consume hours , days or even weeks of computing time ( depending on the initial conditions , desired resolution , and available computational resources ) .",
    "although the use of equal - mass particles , or the more accurate sph equations of motion derived by @xcite , or both , could decrease the total number of particles required , it is still currently impractical to implement a full hydrodynamics calculation for every close stellar encounter during a cluster simulation .",
    "one approach for incorporating strong hydrodynamic interactions and mergers into a grand simulation of a cluster , already successfully implemented by @xcite in the context of galactic nuclei , is to interpolate between the results of a set of previously completed sph simulations .",
    "the sph database of freitag & benz treats all types of hyperbolic collisions between main - sequence stars ( mergers , fly - bys and cases of complete destruction ) , while also varying the parent star masses as well as the eccentricity and periastron separation of their initial orbit .",
    "the tremendous amount of parameter space surveyed precludes having high enough resolution to determine the detailed structure and composition profiles of the collision products for all cases ; however , critical quantities such as mass loss and final orbital elements can be determined accurately .",
    "a second possibility is to forgo hydrodynamics simulations and instead model collision products by physically motivated algorithms and fitting formulae that sort the fluid from the parent stars @xcite .",
    "one advantage of such an approach is that it can handle cases in which one or both of the parent stars is itself a former collision product ( with chemical and structural profiles that are substantially different than that of a standard isolated star of similar mass and type ) .    in this paper , we use both sph calculations and a much faster fluid sorting algorithm to study scenarios in which a newly formed collision product collides with a third parent star . by varying the order and orbital parameters of the collision , we investigate how factors such as shock heating affect the chemical composition and structure profiles of the collision product .",
    "section [ procedure ] presents our procedures and numerical methods , both for our sph calculations (  [ sph ] ) and our fluid sorting algorithm (  [ sorting ] ) .",
    "sph results are presented in ",
    "[ sphresults ] , and then compared to the results of our fluid sorting algorithm in  [ mmasresults ] . in",
    " [ discussion ] we discuss our findings and possible directions for future work .",
    "one means by which we generate collision product models is with the parallel sph code used in @xcite .",
    "the original serial version of this code was developed by @xcite , specifically for the study of stellar interactions such as collisions and binary mergers ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". introduced by @xcite and @xcite , sph is a hydrodynamics method that uses a smoothing kernel to calculate local weighted averages of thermodynamic quantities directly from lagrangian fluid particle positions ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    ". each sph particle can be thought of as a parcel of gas that traces the flow of the fluid , with the kernel providing each particle s spatial extent and the means by which it interacts with neighbouring particles .",
    "the sph code solves the equations of motion of a large number of particles moving under the influence of both hydrodynamic and self - gravitational forces .",
    "all of the scenarios we investigate using sph involve a @xmath2 parent star , represented with 12800 equal - mass sph particles , and two @xmath1 parent stars , each represented with 9600 equal - mass particles .",
    "each of our sph particles therefore has a mass of @xmath9 . for comparison ,",
    "this particle mass is between the masses of the central particles used in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 calculations of @xcite , who used unequal - mass particles to study in detail the outer layers of the fluid in a collision between two @xmath12main - sequence stars . for our purposes",
    ", the use of equal - mass particles is more appropriate , as it allows for higher resolution in the stellar cores and does not waste computational resources on the ejecta .",
    "local densities and hydrodynamic forces at each particle position are calculated by appropriate summations over @xmath13 nearest neighbours .",
    "the size of each particle s smoothing kernel determines the local numerical resolution and is adjusted during each time step to keep @xmath13 close to a predetermined value , 48 for the present calculations .",
    "neighbour lists for each particle are recomputed at every iteration using a linked - list , grid - based parallel algorithm @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic forces acting on each particle include an artificial viscosity contribution that accounts for shocks . as in @xcite , we adopt the artificial viscosity form proposed by @xcite , with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "this form treats shocks well and has the tremendous advantage that it introduces only relatively small amounts of spurious shock heating and numerical viscosity in shear layers @xcite .",
    "a number of physical quantities are associated with each sph particle , including its mass , position , velocity , and entropic variable @xmath17 .",
    "here we adopt a monatomic ideal gas equation of state , appropriate for the stars in our mass range .",
    "that is , @xmath18 , where the adiabatic index @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the pressure and density , respectively .",
    "the entropic variable is closely related ( but not equal ) to specific entropy : both of these quantities are conserved in the absence , and increase in the presence , of shocks .",
    "our code uses an fft - based convolution method to calculate self - gravity .",
    "the fluid density is placed on a zero - padded , 3d grid by a cloud - in - cell method , and then convolved with a kernel function to obtain the gravitational potential at each point on the grid .",
    "gravitational forces are calculated from the potential by finite differencing , and then interpolated for each particle using the same cloud - in - cell assignment scheme . for each collision simulation in this paper ,",
    "the number of grid cells is @xmath22 .",
    "the ejecta leaving the grid interact with the enclosed mass simply as if it were a monopole .",
    "following the same approach as in @xcite , we begin by using a stellar model from the yale rotational evolution code ( yrec ) to help generate sph models of the parent stars .",
    "we focus on collisions involving 0.8 and @xmath1 main - sequence stars , with a primordial helium abundance @xmath23 and metallicity @xmath24 . using yrec ,",
    "these stars were evolved with no rotation to an age of 15 gyr , the amount of time needed for the @xmath0 star to reach turnoff .",
    "the total helium mass fractions for the @xmath25 and @xmath2 parent stars are 0.286 and 0.395 , and their radii are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "see figs .  1 and 2 of @xcite for thermodynamic and composition profiles of the parent stars presented as a function of enclosed mass , as determined by yrec .",
    "to generate our sph models , we use a monte carlo approach to distribute particles according to the desired density distribution , determining values of @xmath17 for each sph particle from its position . to minimize numerical noise , an artificial drag force",
    "is implemented , with artificial viscosity turned off , to relax each sph parent model to the equilibrium configuration used to initiate the collision calculations .",
    "fourteen different chemical abundance profiles are available from the yrec parent models to set the composition of the sph particles .",

    "we focus on triple - star collisions , modelling each collision separately and in succession .",
    "we do not consider fly - bys or grazing collisions in our sph calculations : all of our collisions lead to mergers .",
    "we neglect any direct or indirect effects , including tidal forces , that the third star may have on the dynamics of the first collision .",
    "we assume that the second collision occurs before the first collision product thermally relaxes : a reasonable approximation since contraction to the main - sequence occurs on a thermal time - scale , lasting at least @xmath37 yr for non - rotating products and as long as @xmath38 yr for rapidly rotating products @xcite , much longer than the typical time between collisions in some binary - single or binary - binary interactions ( but see  [ future ] ) .    the orbital trajectory in all our collisions is taken to be parabolic .",
    "this is clearly not appropriate for galactic nuclei , where collisions are typically hyperbolic .",
    "however , in globular clusters , the velocity dispersion is only @xmath39 km s@xmath40 , much less than the 600 km s@xmath40 escape speed from the surface of our @xmath2 turnoff star , and hence all single - single star collisions are essentially parabolic . for collisions involving binaries ( even including some hard binaries ) , the escape speed can still be large compared to the effective relative velocity at infinity .",
    "for example , consider two @xmath2 turnoff stars in a circular orbit of radius 0.05 au in a globular cluster .",
    "this is a hard binary , as each star moves with a velocity of about 60 km s@xmath40 with respect to the center of mass of the binary , a speed significantly larger than the cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "yet , the effective relative velocity at infinity for a collision between one of the binary components and an intruder would typically not be much more than the orbital speed , and therefore still significantly less than the escape speed from our turnoff star .",
    "we therefore expect collisions between a slow intruder and a binary component to be close to parabolic not only for all soft binaries , but also for some ( moderately ) hard binaries    for the first single - single star collision , the stars are initially non - rotating and separated by 5 @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the radius of our turnoff star .",
    "the initial velocities are calculated by approximating the stars as point masses on an orbit with zero orbital energy and a periastron separation @xmath43 .",
    "a cartesian coordinate system is chosen such that these hypothetical point masses of mass @xmath44 and @xmath45 would reach periastron at positions @xmath46 , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 refers to the more massive star .",
    "the orbital plane is chosen to be @xmath50 . with these choices , the centre of mass resides at the origin .",
    "for the first collisions , the gravity grid maintains a fixed spatial extent from -4@xmath41 to + 4@xmath41 along each dimension .     around the @xmath51-axis and",
    "then by an angle @xmath52 around the @xmath53-axis .",
    "the above figure shows how a vector @xmath54 initially pointing along the @xmath53-axis is transformed into the new vector @xmath55 by these rotations .",
    ", width=317 ]    for the second collision , we want to control the relative orientation of the first collision product s rotation axis and the orbital plane ( or , equivalently , the direction of approach of the third parent star ) . to do so , we begin with the final state of the first collision and make two rotations to its particle positions and velocities , through the angles @xmath56 and @xmath52 .",
    "more specifically , the first rotation is clockwise through an angle @xmath56 about the @xmath51 axis , while the second rotation is clockwise through an angle @xmath52 about the @xmath53 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ rotate ] ) .",
    "finally , the particle positions and velocities are uniformly shifted parallel to the @xmath51-@xmath57 plane , and the third star is introduced such that the system s centre of mass will remain at the origin and the periastron positions ( in the two body point mass approximation ) will occur on the @xmath51 axis . in order to allow the bulk of the fluid to remain within the gravity grid",
    ", the grid is extended up to a full width of @xmath58 in the @xmath51 and @xmath57 directions for some of the second collisions .",
    "we use the same iterative procedure as @xcite to determine the bound and unbound mass .",
    "sph structure and composition profiles presented in this paper result from averaging in 100 equally sized bins in the bound mass .",
    "unfortunately , it is extremely difficult to use sph simulations to specify the equilibrium structure of the outermost few per cent of mass in any collision product .",
    "some sph particles , although gravitationally bound , are ejected so far from the system s centre of mass that it would take many dynamical time - scales for them to rain back onto the central product and settle into equilibrium .",
    "our requirement for stopping an sph calculation is that the entropic variable @xmath17 , when averaged over isodensity surfaces , increases outward over at least the inner 95 per cent of the bound mass in the first collision product , and at least 92 per cent in the second collision product .",
    "many calculations are run longer in order to confirm that no rapid changes are still occurring in the structure and chemical composition distributions .",
    "the results of parabolic collisions between low - mass main - sequence stars can be well explained by simple physical arguments . to a good approximation , the fluid from the parent stars sorts itself such that fluid with the lowest values of @xmath17 sinks to the core of the collision product while the larger @xmath17 fluid forms its outer layers .",
    "therefore , the interior structure and the chemical composition profiles of the collision product can be predicted accurately using simple algorithms , instead of hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "based on these ideas , @xcite have recently created a publicly available software package , dubbed make me a star ( mmas ) .",
    "this package produces collision product models close to those of an sph code in considerably less time , while still accounting for shock heating , mass loss , and fluid mixing .",
    "sorting the shocked fluid according to its entropic variable @xmath17 gives the @xmath17 profile of the collision product as a function of the mass @xmath59 enclosed inside an isodensity surface . in the case of the non - rotating products formed in head - on ( @xmath60 ) collisions ,",
    "knowledge of the @xmath61 profile is sufficient to determine the pressure @xmath62 , density @xmath63 , and radius @xmath64 profiles .",
    "using the @xmath17 profile determined by sorting , mmas numerically integrates the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium with @xmath65 to determine the @xmath21 and @xmath20 profiles , which are related through @xmath66 .",
    "the outer boundary condition is that @xmath67 when @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the desired ( gravitationally bound ) mass of the collision product .",
    "the virial theorem provides a check of the resulting profiles .",
    "this approach allows for the quick generation of collision product models , without hydrodynamic simulations , and has already been tested with single - single star collisions .    presented in this paper",
    "are the results from mmas for triple - star collisions ( see  [ mmasresults ] ) .",
    "our procedure is simple .",
    "we call the mmas routine twice , using the output model from the first collision as one of the input parent models in the second . these mmas calculations therefore account for the differences in shock heating that arise from changing the order , or the periastron separations , or both , of the collisions . in addition to investigating all of the scenarios considered with the sph code",
    ", we also use mmas to examine more completely how the sizes of products vary with the periastron separations of the collisions .",
    "furthermore , we include a @xmath3 parent star of radius @xmath70 , whose structure is determined by yrec under the same conditions described in  [ sph ] .    for an off - axis collision , knowledge of the specific angular momentum distribution in the collision product",
    "is necessary to determine its structure fully , which by itself is a challenging problem .",
    "although mmas outputs an approximate specific angular momentum profile of the first collision product , we use only its entropic variable @xmath61 profile to help initiate the second collision .",
    "that is , for one of the parent stars in the second collision , we always give as input to mmas the structure of a non - rotating star with the desired @xmath61 profile , a simplification that both eases and quickens computations .",
    "the validity of this approximation is supported by the sph calculations presented in  [ spin ] .",
    "@xcite implemented version 1.2 of mmas , while the results of this paper use version 1.6 . besides cosmetic changes , the primary enhancement is that the structure of the collision product is integrated with a fehlberg fourth - fifth order runge - kutta method .",
    "in addition , we have fine - tuned the fitted parameter @xmath71 from its previous value of -1.1 to the new value -1.0 , which has the effect of distributing shocks slightly more uniformly throughout the fluid .",

    "however in case 1 , the one @xmath1 star that is involved in only a single collision can deposit its li@xmath34 and be@xmath35 of comparatively low-@xmath17 deeper in the product , resulting in flattened profiles extending further into the interior .",

    "[ slog1819mmas ] plots the entropic variable @xmath17 versus the enclosed mass fraction for the final collision products of cases 18 , 19 , and 20 , as determined both by sph and mmas . cases 18 and 19 differ only in the direction of approach of the third star , and we again see that this variation has little effect on the sph results .",
    "the kink in all of the profiles slightly inside @xmath125 marks the boundary within which fluid from only the @xmath0 star contributes .",
    "mmas again reproduces this feature quite well .",
    "mmas does underestimate the shock heating to the core and hence the central value of @xmath17 , although some of this discrepancy is due to the spurious heating evident in longer sph simulations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that this difference between the mmas and sph models would last only as a transient during the thermal relaxation in a stellar evolution calculation .",
    "it is also worth noting that , while the sph calculations need to be terminated before all of the bound fluid can settle into equilibrium ( see  [ sph ] ) , the mmas @xmath17 profile does steadily increase outward throughout the entire product .",
    "unfortunately it is a difficult task to determine the overall size of a collision product , either with sph simulations or with a package like mmas .",
    "whenever there is any mass loss in an sph simulation , there will also be sph particles that are nearly unbound and , in practice , still moving away from the product when the simulation is terminated .",
    "these particles would ultimately form the outermost layers of the collision product , but it would take an utterly unfeasible amount of time to wait for them to come back and settle into equilibrium .",
    "the entropic variable @xmath17 profile produced by mmas seems quite reasonable , both because it increases all the way out to the surface and because the sph results tend to approach its form as more of the fluid settles into equilibrium .",
    "however , there are no simulation data to compare against for the very outermost layers of a product and so the exact form of the profile there is difficult to validate .",
    "not surprisingly , the radius of the collision product is rather sensitive to the @xmath17 profile .",
    "for example , simply by changing the parameter @xmath71 from -1.0 to the still very reasonable value of -1.1 , which tends to distribute slightly more shock heating to the outer layers ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the radii of our mmas final collision product models for case 1 and for case 2 increase by about a factor of 2 .",
    "despite such uncertainties , it is still interesting to get a crude estimate of the sizes of the collision products immediately from mmas . in making these estimates ,",
    "we do not account for the expansion due to rotation , but instead simply integrate the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a non - rotating star with the same @xmath17 profile , using the outer boundary condition that the pressure vanishes .",
    "the radii calculated therefore represent the sizes that the products would have if some mechanism were to brake their rotation without disturbing their @xmath17 profiles .",
    "[ rvr ] plots the radii at various enclosed mass fractions for        products generated in single - single star collisions involving 0.4 , 0.6 and @xmath0 parent stars , as determined by mmas .",
    "these radii are plotted against the normalized periastron separation @xmath126 , which we allow to exceed unity slightly to account for bulges in the parent stars .",
    "the general trend is that as the periastron separation increases , the collisions are more long - lived , there is more shock heating , and the radii of the collision products increase . because the fluid in the deep interior of the product is largely shielded from shocks , the @xmath17 profile there , and hence the radius @xmath102 profile , are not too strongly dependent on the periastron separation of the collision . as a result , the radii versus periastron separation curves of fig .",
    "[ rvr ] become closer to horizontal as one looks to smaller enclosed mass fraction . for the cases examined in fig .",
    "[ rvr ] , the full ( 100 per cent enclosed mass ) radius of the collision product is always at least about twice the sum of the radii of the parent stars , and often even much larger than this .",
    "for example , if two @xmath0 stars suffer a grazing ( @xmath127 ) collision , the collision product then has a full radius of about @xmath128 , about 20 times larger than the sum @xmath129 of the parent star radii .",
    "we therefore expect that the collisional cross - section of these first products will be significantly enhanced over that of their thermally relaxed counterparts .",
    "[ bw ] is similar to fig .",
    "[ rvr ] , but for triple - star             collisions .",
    "we use different line types to represent various normalized periastron separations @xmath126 for the first collision , and along the horizontal axis we vary the normalized periastron of the second collision . the curves",
    "give the radii at three different enclosed mass fractions .",
    "for each of the six @xmath43 values in a frame of fig .",
    "[ bw ] , we performed a nested loop over 45 equally spaced values of the normalized periastron separation for the second collision , from 0 to 1.1 . therefore , mmas treated 270 different triple - star collisions ( in a few minutes on a pentium iv workstation ) for each of the four plots .",
    "note that there is a general trend for the radius of the collision product to increase as the first periastron separation increases , as expected ; this effect is mild for the 50 per cent enclosed mass radius , and rather dramatic for the full radius . even more significant is the second periastron separation , with grazing second collisions resulting in products that are substantially larger than those from head - on collisions : the shock heating suffered by the already diffuse outer layers of the first collision product is severe when multiple pericentre passages occur before merger .",
    "once @xmath74 grows large enough for the third star s initial impact to be outside of the first product s core , so that more than one pericentre passage would result before merger , then the shock heating is no longer as sensitive to @xmath74 and the full radius surfaces in fig .",
    "[ bw ] tend to plateau .",
    "how strongly the full radius varies with the @xmath74 therefore depends on the mass distribution within the first product . for first products with a more uniform density , such as in the product of two @xmath130 stars ,",
    "the final product size increases more gradually and consistently with @xmath74 .    as the mass of any one of the three parent stars is increased , the trend is for the radius of the collision product to increase as well .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ bw](a ) shows that for collisions in which two @xmath12 stars collide and then a @xmath0 collides with the first product , the final collision product radius does not exceed a few times @xmath131 . if one of the @xmath12 stars is substituted with a @xmath0 star , then the final radius can be as large as about @xmath132 [ see fig .",
    "[ bw](b ) ] .",
    "this extreme size is due to the phenomenally diffuse outer layers of the product : the average density of such a star is only @xmath133 g @xmath134 .",
    "the noise visible on some of the full radius curves is due to approaching the limiting numerical precision during the structure integration in these diffuse regions .    from fig .",
    "[ bw ] we see that the radius that encloses 95 per cent of the total mass , while still large , is often orders of magnitude smaller than the full radius of the final product .",
    "because of the low densities involved , the full radius calculated is rather sensitive to the details of the shock heating during the collision . changing the mmas parameter @xmath71 from -1.0 to -1.1 ,",
    "for example , can increase the full radius by a factor of a few , although the radius enclosing 50 per cent of the total mass does not change by more than a few per cent .",
    "nevertheless , any reasonable form and amount of shock heating yields products that are significantly larger than a thermally relaxed star with the same mass and composition .",
    "colliding the same three parent stars in a different order does not drastically affect the mass of the final product , although it does significantly affect its size .",
    "consider , for example , frames ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "if two @xmath130 stars collide and then the resulting product collides with a @xmath0 star , the final product typically has a radius of order @xmath135 , but if the @xmath0 star is switched into the first collision instead , the final radius is usually in the range from @xmath136 .",
    "the primary reason for this difference is that a collision between the 0.4 and @xmath0 stars yields a product with especially diffuse outer layers , and , as a result , is subject to a larger number of passages and hence more shock heating during a second collision .",
    "we have used sph and the software package mmas to study triple - star collisions .",
    "although such collisions span a tremendous amount of parameter space , our modest number of sph calculations do provide some valuable insights .",
    "for the ( parabolic ) encounters that we consider , we find that the order in which stars collide ( see  [ order ] ) , the angle of approach of the third star (  [ direction ] ) , and the periastron separation of the collisions (  [ spin ] ) have only a slight effect on the chemical composition distribution within the final collision product .",
    "the order and orbital parameters of the collisions can , however , significantly affect the size and structure of the product .",
    "the results of  [ comparison ] help establish that the simple fluid sorting algorithm of mmas reproduce the important features of our sph models , even when one of the parent stars is itself a collision product . the mmas package can therefore be considered an adequate , if not an accurate , substitute for a hydrodynamics code in many situations . this realization will help simplify the process of generating collision product models in cluster simulations , because a full hydrodynamics calculation will not necessarily need to be run for each collision . indeed ,",
    "we hope the mmas package will be used to help account for stellar collisions in dynamics simulations of globular clusters . toward this end",
    ", mmas is already being incorporated into two software packages , triptych and tripletych , that respectively treat encounters between two stars and among three stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these packages are controlled through a web interface and treat the orbital trajectories , possible merger(s ) , and evolution of the merger product and therefore incorporate three main branches of stellar astrophysics : dynamics , hydrodynamics , and evolution .",
    "the product size estimates of  [ sizes ] are admittedly crude .",
    "for example , partial ionization and radiation pressure are neglected .",
    "although the exact size of a collision product is difficult to determine , our calculations indicate that the first and final collision products are always significantly larger than their thermally relaxed counterparts would be .",
    "indeed , according to our mmas calculations in  [ sizes ] , the final collision product can have a radius up to @xmath137 , easily exceeding the size of a typical red giant .",
    "furthermore , these calculations have assumed that some mechanism has braked the often rapid rotation of the products , so any rotation that does remain will only further enhance the size of the products .",
    "the extended sizes of the products will increase the multi - star collision rate over that calculated in previous treatments of binary - single and binary - binary encounters .",
    "all of the scenarios we consider with sph in this paper involve one @xmath84 and two @xmath12 stars . without shock heating ,",
    "the low-@xmath17 fluid of the @xmath0 star would sink to the core of the final collision product , while its high-@xmath17 portions of the @xmath0 would settle in the outer layers .",
    "the intermediate layers of the product would consist of fluid with the same @xmath17 range from all the parents . simply sorting the fluid in this way , without running a hydrodynamics calculation ,",
    "can therefore provide a zeroth - order model of the collision product that captures some of its important qualitative features ( see fig .",
    "[ zeroth_order ] ) .",
    "however , non - uniform shock heating during the collisions somewhat alters the relative values of the entropic variable @xmath17 in the fluid , resulting in a slightly different sorting pattern .",
    "because the amount and distribution of shock heating are dependent on the details of a collision , the sorting of the fluid varies with , for example , the order in which the stars collide .",
    "shock heating can have larger consequences on the chemical abundance profiles of elements , such as c@xmath29 , that exist in substantial amounts only in a small shell in the initial parent stars .",
    "however , the chemical abundance profiles of most elements , particularly helium , are always qualitatively the same , regardless of how the three stars are merged . because the abundance and distribution of helium ( and hence hydrogen ) is one of the most important factors in determining the collision product s subsequent course of stellar evolution , we believe that the order and geometry of the collisions will not significantly affect the stellar evolution of the product .",
    "indeed , @xcite have recently presented a set of stellar evolution calculations for a collision product for which the starting yrec models were generated from sph calculations of different resolutions .",
    "the variations in the initial helium profiles of their models are roughly comparable to those in our helium profiles resulting from colliding three parent stars in different ways .",
    "although @xcite do find detailed differences in the evolution , especially during the `` pre - main - sequence '' contraction , the evolutionary tracks and time - scales are quite similar .",
    "we therefore feel that , for low - velocity collisions , the hydrodynamical details of how three stars are merged will not significantly affect the stellar evolution of the collision product  the major caveat here being that the geometry of the collisions can of course affect the rotation of the product , which in turn can greatly affect its evolution @xcite .",
    "surface abundances of lithium and beryllium are particularly interesting to monitor , as these elements can be used as observational indicators of mixing and perhaps collisional history . as in the single - single star collisions presented by @xcite , we find that the triple - star mergers presented here yield collision products that are severely depleted of lithium and somewhat of beryllium at the surface",
    ". even in the relatively gentle ( parabolic ) cases that we have considered , the collisions are energetic enough to expel most of the lithium and beryllium from the outer layers of the parents .",
    "there are many scenarios to explore when dealing with collisions in environments as chaotic as dense stellar systems .",
    "different orbital geometries besides the parabolic trajectories treated in this paper still need to be considered in more detail .",
    "large stellar velocities in galactic nuclei lead to hyperbolic collisions . in globular clusters , perturbations to a binary can lead to an elliptical collision , while an encounter with a very hard binary can lead to significantly hyperbolic collisions .",
    "future studies may want to include a more detailed look at the hydrodynamics during grazing encounters , which could be done efficiently with the help of grape ( short for gravity pipe ) special purpose hardware for calculating the self - gravity of the system .",
    "furthermore , encounters involving more than three stars , such as in binary - binary interactions , may also warrant further examination : for example , the final collision product generated in a triple - star merger is typically so extended that it could immediately start suffering roche lobe overflow if left in orbit around a fourth star .    collisions among a larger variety of stellar types and masses , reflective of the diverse populations of clusters , will also need to be explored . we have been concentrating on low - mass main - sequence stars , but collisions between high - mass main - sequence stars in young compact star clusters , or giants located in the dense cores of globular clusters , for example , are frequent",
    ". a logical first step would be to examine high - mass main - sequence stars in a runaway merger scenario .",
    "it would therefore be very useful to develop a generalization of the fluid sorting method that includes radiation pressure in the equation of state .    due to shock heating during the collision , the product is much larger than a thermally equilibrated main - sequence star of the same mass .",
    "how much of an effect this increased radius has on the effective cross section for merger is subject to many variables , including the structure of the product s outer layers and the velocity of approaching stars . in environments such as active galactic nuclei , where relative velocities tend to be high ,",
    "the low - density outer layers of a newly formed collision product could likely get stripped by passing stars .",
    "however , in globular clusters , where stellar velocities tend to be small , collisions with even low - density envelopes may lead to significantly increased rates of merger .",
    "it would be useful to develop a robust collision module that could quickly predict whether any given collision trajectory will lead to a merger , and , if not , describe how the stars are affected by the interaction .",
    "one simple approximation often implemented in cluster simulations is that a collision product instantaneously achieves its thermally relaxed radius , a good approximation when the time between collisions is much longer than the thermal time - scale . arguing instead that the global thermal time - scale of the first product can be much larger than the time between collisions in interactions involving binaries",
    ", we make a different approximation in this paper , namely that the first product s radius ( and more generally its structure ) does not substantially evolve between collisions .",
    "future scattering experiments could model thermally relaxing stars and study more carefully the timescale between collisions mediated by binaries .",
    "the thermal time - scale in the outer layers of a collision product can be orders of magnitude less than its global thermal time - scale ( see table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that it may actually be necessary to follow the thermal contraction and stellar orbits simultaneously .",
    "indeed , in the extremely low density layers of a collision product , it is even possible for the thermal time - scale to be comparable to the ( hydro)dynamical time - scale , so that the product could undergo significant thermal contraction even before it reaches hydrodynamical equilibrium .",
    "it would be helpful if future stellar evolution calculations of collision products included a detailed description of the products size and structure throughout the thermal relaxation stage .",
    "how quickly the outer layers of the thermally expanded product change with time will substantially affect its likelihood of subsequent collisions .",
    "initial conditions for such stellar evolution calculations could be provided by the publicly available mmas package .",
    "the primary hurdle for incorporating collisions into realistic stellar dynamics simulations is currently the stellar evolution of the collision products .",
    "such stars are highly non - canonical , typically with very peculiar structural and composition profiles , and present a challenging set of initial conditions for stellar evolution codes . to make matters even more intricate ,",
    "rotation , which is typically rapid after merging , will affect the structural properties and chemical compositions of the stars as they evolve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this rapid rotation also has the effect of ejecting mass as the product thermally contracts .",
    "studying this emitted mass will be worthwhile , as it may likely carry away angular momentum and at least partially brake rotating collision products .",
