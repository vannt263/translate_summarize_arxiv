    "_ a handlebody - link _ is an embedding of handlebodies into a 3-manifold @xcite .",
    "especially an embedding of one handlebody into a 3-manifold is called _ a handlebody - knot_. in case the genus of each component of a handlebody - link is one , it can be regarded as an ordinary link .",
    "handlebody - links are also regarded as _ neighborhood equivalence _ class of spatial graphs @xcite .",
    "two spatial graphs are neighborhood equivalent if they have isotopic regular neighborhoods . hence handlebody - links are represented by spatial graphs whose regular neighborhoods are isotopic to the handlebody - links . in the present paper ,",

    "we consider two first homology groups for each component of the two - component handlebody - links .",
    "the invariants for two - component handlebody - links are elementary divisors of a matrix whose entries are linking numbers of closed circles corresponding to the basis of one homology group and that of the other homology group . when a genus of each component of handlebody - links is one , thus they are ordinary links , our invariants coincide with the linking number of them",
    ".    the rest of the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we define the invariant of two - component handlebody - links .",
    "we show an example of the invariant in section [ sec3 ] . in section [ sec4 ] , we see a geometrical meaning of the invariant that is a relationship to first homology groups of exterior spaces of handlebody - link components .",
    "in this section , we construct the invariant numbers for two - component handlebody - links in @xmath2 . in case",
    "both components are genus 1 ( i.e. two - component links ) , these numbers correspond to the linking number .",
    "( _ linking numbers for handlebody - links _ ) let @xmath3 be a two - component handlebody - link in @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 be its components and @xmath6 be genera of them respectively .",
    "we fix bases of first homology groups @xmath7 and @xmath8 of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; @xmath9 for @xmath7 and @xmath10 for @xmath8 . @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be regarded as embedded closed oriented circles in the @xmath2 .",
    "then we make a @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 whose @xmath15 entry is a linking number of @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath16 then we consider the elementary divisors @xmath17 ( for some @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) of @xmath14 as @xmath20-module .",
    "note that @xmath21 are unique up to signs .",
    "if @xmath22 , choosing positive signs , we define @xmath23 otherwise @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are separated , the linking numbers @xmath25 is equal to @xmath26 .",
    "we remark that the linking number above @xmath27 is bilinear for sums of elements of the first homology groups and scalar multiplying over @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath28 , for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the same relation holds for the second argument .",
    "@xmath25 is independent of the ways taking bases of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "thus @xmath25 is an invariant of two - component handlebody - links .    changing a basis of the first homology group @xmath7 ( resp .",
    "@xmath8 ) causes multiplying an @xmath31 ( resp .",
    "an @xmath32 ) regular matrix with integer entries from left ( resp .",
    "right ) to @xmath14 , and these operations do not change the elementary divisors of @xmath14 .",
    "we show a calculation of @xmath25 for the handlebody - link @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we represent components of the handlebody - link by bouquet graphs .",
    "the original handlebody - link is a regular neighborhood of the graphs . by virtue of the bouquet graph representation ,",
    "we see bases of first homology groups @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the components explicitly as the oriented loop edges @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the graphs .",

    "thus @xmath39",
    "we remark that by sliding a loop along another loop , we have a new bouquet graph representing the same handlebody - link .",
    "this corresponds to adding or subtracting a row or column to other row or column .",
    "therefore we can choose bouquet graphs such that the non - zero entries of the linking matrix of their loops is exactly the elementary divisors of the matrix .",
    "thus the linking number of the handlebody - link is realized by such bouquet graphs .",
    "in this section , we show a relationship between the linking numbers @xmath25 of handlebody - links and the first homology group of a complement space of one component @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) in @xmath2 with relations derived from another component @xmath5 ( resp .",
    "@xmath4 ) .",
    "first we consider the first homology group @xmath40 of the complement of @xmath4 .",
    "remark that @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a genus of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a basis of the first homology group @xmath8 of @xmath5 where @xmath44 is a genus of @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath5 is in the complement space @xmath45 , we can regard the elements of the basis as oriented closed circles in @xmath45 and as elements of @xmath40 .",
    "then we consider a quotient group of @xmath40 by a subgroup generated by @xmath46 ; @xmath47 @xmath48 is independent of choices of the basis of @xmath8 and determined only by @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath48 is a finitely generated abelian group and have a form @xmath49 for some @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a torsion part of @xmath48 .",
    "if the component @xmath5 is separated from @xmath4 , the circles of the basis of @xmath8 are trivial circles in @xmath45 and @xmath52 . by tangling @xmath5 to @xmath4 , a part of @xmath53 degenerates to the torsion part @xmath51 .",
    "so we think @xmath51 has information of a tangle between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    on the other hand",
    ", we can construct a group @xmath54 as above exchanging the roles of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath55 for some @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a torsion part of @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath57 also has information of a tangle between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "then we have the next proposition .",
    "it is sufficient to show @xmath59 .",
    "we see a form of @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 be bouquet graphs representing the components @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , i.e. the regular neighborhood of @xmath60 ( resp .",
    "@xmath61 ) is equivalent to @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) .",
    "let @xmath62 and @xmath63 be edges of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "they are regarded as bases of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we take a basis @xmath64 of @xmath65 such that @xmath66 is a closed oriented circle that rounds the edge @xmath11 of @xmath60 one time .",
    "each @xmath12 , as a close oriented circle in @xmath45 , is represented by the basis of @xmath67 as @xmath68 from the choice of basis , the coefficient @xmath69 is how many times the edge @xmath12 of @xmath61 rounds the edge @xmath11 of @xmath60 .",
    "these observations lead a representation of @xmath70 ; @xmath71 which is an exact sequence of @xmath20-module homomorphisms such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 is a surjection , where a matrix representation for @xmath74 is equal to @xmath14 in section [ sec2 ] ( assuming appropriate orientations for edges of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) . by appropriate change of basis of @xmath40 and relations for them ( i.e. multiplying regular matrices from both sides of @xmath14 )",
    ", we have a rectangular diagonal matrix @xmath75 where @xmath76 are elementary divisors of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore @xmath48 have a form @xmath77 and we have @xmath78    we do the same operation for @xmath79 as above and have a representation of the abelian group @xmath54 ; @xmath80 where a matrix representation for @xmath81 is @xmath82 , a transposed matrix of @xmath14 .",
    "since elementary divisors of @xmath82 is equal to those of @xmath14 , we have a form of @xmath54 , @xmath83 and we have @xmath84 therefore @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath54 have the same torsion part @xmath86 , which have the information of tangle of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and this is what the linking numbers @xmath25 indicate .",
    "we remark that if @xmath87 , @xmath88 is a trivial group and does not appear explicitly in the torsion part .",
    "when we calculate the linking number from the torsion part , we also need the number @xmath89 which is the difference of rank between @xmath48 and @xmath40 or @xmath54 and @xmath79",
