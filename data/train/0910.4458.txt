    "our knowledge of stellar structure and evolution rests heavily on the comparison between theory and observation .",
    "double - lined eclipsing binaries ( hereafter ebs ) have long been at the center of this process , since they allow the mass  the most fundamental of all stellar properties  as well as the radius to be determined to very high precision ( and accuracy ) , often as good as 1% , independently of the distance and independently of any calibrations .",
    "such high precision enables stringent tests of theory , as described , e.g. , by @xcite . in the last decade",
    "or so it has become clear that stars in the lower main - sequence show significant discrepancies when compared to standard models",
    ". studies of several key systems have shown unambiguously that the radii predicted by the models are systematically up to @xmath810% too small , and the temperatures @xmath85% too high ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the deviations are commonly attributed to the high level of chromospheric activity present in these systems .",
    "orbital periods are typically short , and as a result tidal forces tend to synchronize the components rotation with the orbital motion .",
    "the rapid rotation , in turn , induces the activity , which can manifest itself in the form of copious x - ray emission , flaring , h@xmath9 and ca  ii h and k emission , spottedness , and other effects .",
    "according to the recent compilation by @xcite , among the eclipsing binaries with at least one component below 0.8  m@xmath10 only five have reliable mass and radius determinations with relative errors that are smaller than 3% .",
    "these are , in order of decreasing mass , uv  psc @xcite , gu  boo @xcite , yy  gem @xcite , cu  cnc @xcite , and cm  dra @xcite .",
    "a number of other similar systems are known , but are not yet at the same level of precision _ and _ accuracy . for further progress",
    "it is therefore important to either improve the determinations in the latter cases , or to find new ones where those conditions are met .",
    "the eclipsing system reported here is one of these , which in addition presents the largest difference in mass between the components , providing in principle extra leverage for the comparison with models .",

    "the radial - velocity variability was found by @xcite , and subsequent spectroscopic and photometric studies carried out by @xcite confirmed i m  vir to be both double - lined and eclipsing , and to be composed of a g7 star and a late - k or early - m star , thus piquing our interest .",
    "the orbital period was estimated as 1.3085 days .",
    "very little data on this binary have been published since , other than sparse photometry and occasional reports on the chromospheric activity and x - ray flaring @xcite .",

    "* ) were used in each case to record a single 45  echelle order centered at a wavelength of 5188.5 , featuring the gravity - sensitive lines of the  b triplet .",
    "the resolving power provided by this setup is @xmath15 .",
    "nominal signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios for the 138 spectra we obtained range from 13 to 58 per resolution element of 8.5  .",
    "the first observation was taken in 1984 january 1 , and monitoring continued until 2009 may 10 .",
    "a handful of the early spectra are the same ones included in the work of @xcite , who discovered the radial - velocity variability , but have been re - reduced and analyzed here with much improved methods , as we now describe .",
    "all of our spectra are double - lined , but the secondary is comparatively quite faint , accounting for only 6% of the light of the primary ( see below ) .",
    "radial velocities for both stars were derived using todcor , a two - dimensional cross - correlation technique introduced by @xcite .",
    "this method uses two templates , one for each component of the binary , which we selected from a large library of synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres by r.  l.  kurucz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these templates have been calculated for a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath16 ) , surface gravities ( @xmath17 ) , rotational velocities ( @xmath18 when seen in projection ) , and metallicities ( [ m / h ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , the optimum templates were selected by running extensive grids of cross - correlations with todcor , seeking to maximize the average correlation weighted by the strength of each exposure .",
    "because of the faintness of the secondary , only the parameters for the bright star can be determined reliably from our spectra .",
    "initially we assumed @xmath19 , and determined @xmath16 and @xmath18 for a range of metallicities between [ m / h ] @xmath20 and [ m / h ] @xmath21 .",
    "the optimal values were found by interpolation in [ m / h ] .",
    "we then repeated the correlations for a lower value of @xmath22 in order to bracket the estimate from the analysis described later ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "interpolation in @xmath17 to this final value resulted in @xmath24  k and @xmath25  .",
    "the formal metallicity that maximizes the correlation is [ m / h ] = @xmath26 .",
    "while this suggests an overall abundance close to solar , the uncertainty is likely to be at least 0.25  dex , and we consider the estimate primarily as a free parameter included to optimize the match between the synthetic templates and the observed spectra .",
    "we note , furthermore , that because of our narrow spectral window , there is a strong correlation between temperature and metallicity . in this case , however , the @xmath16 value reported above is consistent with various photometric estimates described below in  [ sec : absolute ] , in turn lending more credence to the metallicity estimate . for the final velocity determinations we adopted the set of template parameters closest to the values above that",
    "maximizes the average correlation ( @xmath27  k , @xmath28  , @xmath19 , and solar composition ) .",
    "small differences in these template parameters compared to the interpolated values do not affect the velocities significantly . for the secondary template we adopted the same metallicity , and parameters consistent with the results from  [ sec : absolute ] : @xmath29  k , @xmath30  , @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to the velocities , we have determined the light ratio between the components at the mean wavelength of our observations , following @xcite , accounting for the difference in line blocking between the primary and the much cooler secondary .",
    "the value we obtain is @xmath31 .",
    "although todcor significantly reduces systematic errors in the radial velocities caused by line blending , residual effects can remain as a result of shifts of the spectral lines in and out of our narrow spectral window as a function of orbital phase .",
    "experience has shown that these effects must be examined on a case - by - case basis .",
    "we investigated them here by means of numerical simulations similar to those described by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we generated synthetic composite spectra matching our observations by combining copies of the primary and secondary templates used above , shifted to the appropriate velocities for each of the exposures as predicted by a preliminary orbital solution , and scaled to the observed light ratio .",
    "these synthetic observations were then processed with todcor in exactly the same way as the real spectra , and the resulting velocities were compared with the input shifts .",
    "the differences for i m  vir are shown in figure  [ fig : cortodcor ] , and are less than 0.5  for the primary but reach values as large as 13  for the secondary .",
    "similarly large differences have been found occasionally for other systems using the same instrumentation ( e.g. , ad  boo , gx  gem , vz  cep ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have applied these differences as corrections to the raw velocities of i m  vir . the impact on the masses",
    ", however , is very small : only 0.26% for the primary and 0.14% for the secondary .",
    "the reason for this is that the large corrections for the secondary are similar and of the same sign at both quadratures , therefore amounting mostly to an overall systematic shift rather than a change in the velocity semi - amplitude .",
    "similar adjustments based on the same simulations were made to the light ratio , and are already included in the value reported above .",

    "the theoretical temperatures are adjusted by factors @xmath158 , and the model luminosity is unchanged .",
    "the dashed lines in the two bottom panels represent the standard models for the same age and metallicity , but without any corrections for activity ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "]    the implication of the above fit is that the radius of the primary star is 3.7% larger than predicted by theory , and its temperature is just under 2% ( 100",
    "k ) too cool . for the secondary the models underpredict the radii by 7.5% , and overpredict the temperature by about 3.5% , or 150  k. it appears , therefore , that _ both _ stars are affected by chromospheric activity . while this is not unexpected for the secondary , the fact that the primary also seems to show the same anomalies supports other recent evidence that the phenomenon is not confined to low - mass stars , but reaches stars of solar mass ( 0.981  @xmath44 for i m  vir  a ) . other examples of solar - type stars where this has been documented include vz  cep  b ( 1.108  @xmath44 ; * ? ? ?",

    "there is ample evidence of activity in i m  vir , which was in fact discovered through its x - ray emission , as described in ",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .",
    "activity is manifested in our light curves in the form of spottedness , and in retrospect , our finding that the best fit to the photometry is achieved with one spot on each star as opposed to spots on any single component is consistent with the results of the stellar evolution modeling in the preceding paragraph , which indicates that both stars are affected .",
    "this is not surprising , given that both have convective envelopes and are rapid rotators .",
    "additional manifestations of activity in this case include a filled - in h@xmath9 line @xcite or the possible detection of h@xmath9 emission from the secondary @xcite ,  h and k emission @xcite , and flaring in x  rays @xcite . with the x - ray count rates and hardness ratio from _ rosat _ , the energy conversion factor prescribed by @xcite , and",
    "our bolometric luminosities and derived distance , we have estimated the ratio of the x - ray to bolometric luminosity for the two components .",
    "we obtain @xmath166 and @xmath167 , respectively , where we have assumed equal x - ray emission from each star since the _ rosat _ observation does not resolve the binary .",
    "these values are consistent with the secondary being completely saturated , and the primary being near saturation .",
    "they are similar to the x - ray luminosities seen in other active binary systems , and are in fact in good agreement with the trend between the radius anomalies and @xmath168 found by @xcite ( see , e.g. , her figure  2 ) .",
    "the differences in radius and temperature between the models and the observations for i m  vir are of similar magnitude as those found for other active stars with convective envelopes , but do rely quite strongly on our adopted effective temperatures for the stars because of the way the @xmath157 correction factors have been determined . given the greater difficulty of determining absolute temperatures than other properties such as masses and radii , one may wonder to what extent systematic errors in @xmath16 might affect the result , and also the derived age and metallicity .",
    "we focus here on systematic errors in the primary temperature , since the secondary value is tied to the primary through the light - curve solution .",
    "we explored this question by perturbing the temperatures by @xmath36100  k , with corresponding adjustments to the luminosities , and repeating the grid search for @xmath157 .",
    "the results are illustrated in the top panel of figure  [ fig : betagrid ] , where the dashed lines show that the best - fit metallicity changes by @xmath360.10  dex ( marked by the short dotted lines ) .",
    "the changes in the @xmath157 factors are @xmath360.010 for @xmath164 and @xmath360.003 for @xmath163 , and the change in the best - fit age is @xmath360.50  gyr , or @xmath820% .",
    "our extensive spectroscopic and photometric observations of i m  vir have enabled us to determine highly accurate values for the absolute masses and radii of both stars to better than 2% , as well as accurate temperatures ( table  [ tab : absolute ] ) .",
    "this eclipsing system now joins the ranks of those with the best determined properties ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the primary is of solar type , and the secondary is a late k dwarf .",
    "the very different masses provide increased discriminating power for testing models of stellar evolution .",
    "we find evidence that both components , which have convective envelopes and are rapidly rotating , show discrepancies in their radii and temperatures compared to calculations by @xcite , similar to those reported for other low - mass stars .",
    "the predicted radii are too small by 3.7% and 7.5% for the primary and secondary , and the theoretical temperatures are too high by 100  k and 150  k , respectively .",
    "these effects are ascribed to chromospheric activity , for which there is abundant evidence in this system in the form of x - ray ,  h and k , and h@xmath9 emission , x - ray flaring , and spottedness seen directly in the light curves . the larger effect observed for",
    "the secondary is consistent with the larger fraction of that star being covered by spots ( a factor of two difference ) .",
    "the fact that the near - solar mass primary is also affected supports recent findings for other binaries indicating that the impact of activity on the structure of stars is not limited to the m dwarfs , as previously thought , but most likely extends to all stars with convective envelopes , reaching up to masses near or larger than that of the sun .",
    "current stellar evolution models do not account for these effects .",
    "some progress in this area has been made to incorporate magnetic activity in the theoretical calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and initial results are very encouraging .",
    "a crucial ingredient for the comparison with models is the chemical composition .",
    "the best - fit models for i m  vir indicate an age of @xmath169  gyr and a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath170 .",
    "the uncertainties here represent the sensitivity to systematic errors of @xmath36100  k in the effective temperatures , but exclude unquantified systematics in the @xcite models themselves , which are difficult to evaluate . while the metallicity prediction seems to be in good agreement with our rough spectroscopic abundance estimate in ",
    "[ sec : spectroscopy ] and that of @xcite , as well as photometric estimates for both stars , a proper detailed spectroscopic analysis of both components is still lacking , and is essential to validate the comparison .",
    "such determinations are notoriously difficult in double - lined binaries , which is why relatively few have them . in i",
    "m  vir this task would be challenging for two reasons : the secondary is very faint compared to the primary , and it is of late spectral type .",
    "abundance determinations for late - type stars are still problematic due to shortcomings in the model atmospheres .",
    "however , i m  vir offers a unique opportunity because the secondary eclipse is total .",
    "high s / n ratio spectra taken with a sufficiently large telescope during the 28-minute totality phase would be of the primary only , and can be analyzed with standard techniques . the uncertainty in this observing window is estimated to be approximately @xmath365 minutes , based on the uncertainties in the geometric light - curve parameters .",
