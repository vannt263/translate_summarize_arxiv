    "in the context of holography , ryu and takayanagi @xcite proposed a remarkably simple prescription to compute entanglement entropy ( ee ) for the field theory dual to einstein gravity .",
    "one computes the minimal area for the entangling surface which extends into the bulk from an area functional .",
    "when the corresponding area functional is evaluated on a black hole horizon it gives the black hole entropy .",
    "if the entangling surface is spherical , there exists an independent derivation of holographic entanglement entropy due to casini , huerta and myers @xcite .",
    "this derivation holds quite generally since it maps the calculation of the entanglement entropy of spherical regions to the wald entropy of hyperbolic black holes @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this generalization is not known for more general entangling surfaces .    in field",
    "theory one frequently uses the replica trick @xcite namely , s_ee=_n1",
    "s_n=_n1  ^n , where @xmath0 is the reduced density matrix .",
    "the @xmath1 s are the renyi entropies . from the holographic side",
    ", this entails being able to do calculations for general @xmath2 and then doing an analytic continuation to @xmath3 .",
    "fursaev suggested a derivation @xcite of the ryu - takayanagi prescription which appeared to have some problems since it led to the wrong renyi entropies @xcite ( there is a proposed resolution to this in @xcite ) . until recently , it was not clear if the implementation of this on the gravity side was consistent as it appeared to give rise to singularities in the bulk leading to inconsistencies ( see @xcite for a solution to this problem in ads@xmath4 ) .    unlike black hole entropy where for a general theory of gravity there exists the wald formula @xcite , there is no such elegant generalization for holographic entanglement entropy .",
    "the only case where there are arguments to extend the ryu - takayanagi minimization prescription is that of lovelock theories @xcite .",
    "it is not known for instance if for an arbitrary theory of gravity the minimization prescription holds .",
    "it is thus of interest and importance to extend the holographic entanglement entropy prescription to general higher derivative theories of gravity .",
    "recently , lewkowycz and maldacena @xcite have proposed a way to set up the calculation of entanglement entropy in what appears to be a self - consistent manner .",
    "they introduced the concept of a generalized gravitational entropy which is an extension of the usual euclidean methods applicable to black hole entropy calculation to solutions where there is no @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "they observed that when one considers @xmath6 with @xmath7 in the gravity solutions , quite generally there would be singularities in the equations of motion which can be shown to vanish if the minimal area conditition is satisfied .",
    "we ask what happens if their procedure is extended to higher derivative theories . we will consider four derivative theories of gravity .",
    "in particular we will consider gauss - bonnet gravity as this is the simplest higher derivative theory with nice properties .",
    "we will also consider more general four derivative theories and show that the above method only works for gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "furthermore , recently it was observed @xcite in the context of einstein gravity that if the brown - york tensor @xcite is evaluated on the co - dimension one entangling surface ( not setting @xmath8 ) , then setting the time - time component of this tensor to zero gives identical equations for the surface as what follows from the ryu - takayanagi prescription .",
    "the simple reason for this is that for static surfaces , the co - dimension one extrinsic curvature trivially decomposes : @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath10 leads to @xmath11 which is the same as the minimal surface condition for the @xmath12 slice used in the ryu - takayanagi calculation .",
    "but the combination @xmath13 is nothing but the @xmath14 component of the usual brown - york tensor evaluated on the co - dimension one slice in @xmath15-dimensions .",
    "this equivalence is of course certainly not guaranteed for higher derivative theories .",
    "thus it is interesting to ask what happens in the gauss - bonnet theory where the gibbons - hawking surface term is known @xcite .",
    "the primary questions of interest in this paper are :    1 .   in higher derivative theories ,",
    "does the equation for the entangling surface derived from the generalized gravitational entropy prescription agree with existing proposals ? 2 .",
    "what role does the area functional play in euclidean gravity calculations ? 3 .",
    "for general four derivative theories , is there an extension to the ryu - takayanagi area functional ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we summarize the proposals for entanglement entropy in gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "we also show what the equation for the entangling surface is if we set @xmath16 on the co - dimension one entangling surface . in section 3 we extend the derivation of the minimal area due to lewkowycz and maldacena to gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "we also consider more general four derivative gravity . in section 4 , we show that the area functional in gauss - bonnet gravity is a suitable counterterm to remove power law divergences in an euclidean gravity calculation .",

    "* for general four derivative theories , is there an extension to the ryu - takayanagi area functional ? * + this question of course is of great interest and relevance since the wald formula for black holes is meant to work for an arbitrary theory with higher derivative corrections .",
    "our investigations in this paper seem to suggest that the answer is no . at four derivative order , only for",
    "gauss - bonnet theory does there appear to be an area functional .",
    "this conclusion was reached by assuming the generalized gravitational entropy approach used in @xcite to be valid .",
    "also , we did not treat the higher derivative coupling perturbatively . in this case ( which is of course more natural in the context of string theory ) , it may be possible to see the existence of an area functional perturbatively .",
    "for example , it is always possible in a perturbative framework , to perform a field redefinition and recast four derivative terms into gauss - bonnet ( where there is an area functional ) . + another point we should make is suppose we considered more general corrections of the form @xmath198 . in this case",
    ", it appears that the form for @xmath199 would affect the equations for the minimal surface .",
    "thus the area functional , assuming one exists , can not be purely geometrical  this of course could have been anticipated from the wald formula for black hole entropy .",
    "there are several open questions .",
    "the most important one is to see if a modification of the lewkowycz - maldacena method can work for arbitrary extrinsic curvatures unlike what we found here where the extrinsic curvatures needed to be small .",
    "the implications for the ( non ) existence of an area functional for arbitrary theories of gravity also need to be investigated . of course",
    ", entanglement entropy should satisfy strong subadditivity and it is not guaranteed that arbitrary theories of gravity with holographic duals ( assuming they exist ) should satisfy this property . in type iib string theory , there is a well known @xmath200 correction @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to extend the derivation to this case . in quasi - topological gravity @xcite ,",
    "the radial equations are two derivative similar to gauss - bonnet .",
    "one can try to see if an area functional exists in this case .",
    "it will also be interesting to consider excited states @xcite from a first principles approach .",
    ": we thank janet hung , gautam mandal and shiraz minwalla for discussions . as acknowledges support from a ramanujan fellowship , govt . of india .",
    "in this section , we will present some details of the @xmath90 split of the @xmath14 component of the stress tensor for the gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "the @xmath14 component of @xmath201 can be split as , @xmath202\\big)\\ , .",
    "\\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we split all the quantities along time and the rest .",
    "@xmath203 similarly , @xmath204 using this relations in @xmath205 @xmath206 now , @xmath207 - 2\\r_{ij}\\k^{ij}\\\\&-(2r^{t}_{t}+\\r^{i}_{i})k^{t}_{t}-2r^{t}_{t}(k^{t}_{t}+\\k^{i}_{i})+4 k^{t}_{t}r^{t}_{t}+2r^{t}{}_{itj}\\k^{ij}\\\\ & = \\r\\,\\k-2 \\r_{ij}\\k^{ij}\\ , .",

    "t=0 and ^t_t(-k^3 + 3kk_2 - 2 k_3)=^t_t(-^3 + 3_2 - 2_3 ) .",
    "so finally , t^t_t=(- -l^2 ) .",
    "we will proceed here just like the sphere case and demonstrate the fact that @xmath53 arises as a counterterm to remove all the power law divergences from the euclidean action .",
    "@xmath209 we will quote the results for the different parts of the action after expanding around small @xmath182 .",
    "@xmath210 @xmath211 now , i_gh=+ + and , i_ct=-+ + and the last piece , @xmath212 adding them together we get , @xmath213 now when we solved for @xmath59 around @xmath103 , the @xmath214 term came as @xmath215 . but here @xmath182 is dimensionful so @xmath216 should actually be @xmath217 where @xmath218 is some arbitrary scale . at this level , we can not determine what this scale is .",
    "so we do not have to set it to @xmath219 . on the other hand , the @xmath220 terms that lead to @xmath221",
    "must be replaced with @xmath222 where the @xmath219 comes from the lower limit of the integral .",
    "thus the @xmath223 and these terms can be distinguished .",
    "now since this is a conformal field theory , it can not matter what we choose the scale to be .",
    "so it must be possible to remove these terms by choosing some scheme .",
    "one convenient way to choose a scheme is to set @xmath224 so that the @xmath225 terms are zero . in this scheme , i_tot= ( )",
    "+ note that there is no power law divergences in @xmath45 .",
    "as before , @xmath226 where @xmath227 is a @xmath228 number yet to be determined and @xmath229 . unlike the sphere case @xmath45",
    "is dependent on the temperature .",
    "f = i_tott= ( ) + .",
    "then , @xmath230 identifying @xmath231 we get , s_ee= - ( ) + which is the universal term for a cylinder . the key missing link in this computation is an independent reason for the choice of @xmath227 . in the sphere case note that @xmath232 worked out to be the same temperature in the map from the entanglement entropy of the sphere to the thermal entropy of a hyperboloid @xcite .",
    "we list here the curvature tensors required for the calculations in section 3 in an expansion in both @xmath219 and @xmath233 .",
    "also we have used @xmath238 in the expression of @xmath239 @xmath240 from here on all the indices are lowered and raised using @xmath241 the @xmath242 s and @xmath243 here are constructed using @xmath241 the curvature tensors in section 3 involve @xmath171 s which are made of @xmath32 .",
