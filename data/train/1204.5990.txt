    "understanding how the yarkovsky force modifies asteroid orbits has illuminated how asteroids and meteorites are transported to near - earth space from the main belt and has allowed for deeper understanding of the structure of asteroid families  @xcite .",
    "the yarkovsky force is necessary for accurately predicting asteroid trajectories , including those of potentially hazardous asteroids @xcite .    the yarkovsky effect ( or force )",
    "describes the process by which an asteroid s surface thermal lag and rotation result in net thermal emission that is not aligned towards the sun @xcite .",
    "the so - called _ diurnal component _ of the yarkovsky effect operates as follows .",
    "a prograde - spinning object generally has a component of this surface thermal emission anti - aligned with the motion along the orbit , producing a net increase in the object s semi - major axis ( i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the semi - major axis ) .",
    "conversely , a retrograde - spinning object generally has a component aligned with its velocity , shortening its semi - major axis ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) .",
    "the maximum possible drift rate for any radiation - powered force acting on near - earth asteroids ( neas ) can be obtained by equating the incident solar radiation energy in a given time interval to the change in orbital energy during the same interval .",
    "we find @xmath7 where @xmath1 is an efficiency factor analogous to that used by @xcite , @xmath8 is the eccentricity , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the luminosity and mass of the sun , @xmath11 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the effective diameter and bulk density of the asteroid .",
    "this equation exhibits the expected dependence on the asteroid area - to - mass ratio . in convenient units",
    ", it reads @xmath14 maximum efficiency ( @xmath1=1 ) would convert all incoming solar radiation into a change in orbital energy .",
    "we will show in section  [ sec : results ] that typical yarkovsky efficiencies are @xmath15 , and that typical rates are @xmath16au / myr for kilometer - sized asteroids .",
    "the low efficiency and rates are due to the fact that it is the momentum of departing thermal photons that moves the asteroid .",
    "@xcite used precise radar ranging measurements to ( 6489 ) golevka and reported the first detection of asteroidal yarkovsky drift .",
    "the drift rate for this nea of @xmath17 au / myr  @xcite corresponds to an efficiency @xmath18 for @xmath12=530  m and @xmath19  kg  m@xmath20 .",
    "@xcite employed the yarkovsky effect to link a 1950 observation to asteroid ( 152563 ) 1992 bf with a @xmath21 rate of @xmath22 au / myr .",
    "this corresponds to an efficiency @xmath23 for @xmath12=420  m and @xmath13=2500  kg  m@xmath20 .",
    "if 1992 bf has a density closer to 1500  kg  m@xmath20 , the efficiency would be @xmath24 .",
    "there have been other searches for the effects of non - gravitational forces in asteroid orbits . @xcite",
    "considered a semi - major axis drift in the orbit of ( 1566 ) icarus and found @xmath25 au / myr .",
    "our best estimate is @xmath26 au / myr .",
    "@xcite found it necessary to incorporate a non - gravitational term @xmath27 au / myr in his orbit determination of ( 4179 ) toutatis , however the availability of radar ranges in 1992 , 1996 , 2004 , and 2008 strongly suggest a drift magnitude that does not exceed @xmath28 au / myr .",
    "@xcite examined the orbits of 10 asteroids and found drifts in four asteroids , including a @xmath29 au / myr drift for ( 1862 ) apollo .",
    "@xcite used a cometary model to search for perturbations and also detected a drift associated with ( 1862 ) apollo , though a value was not reported .",
    "our best estimate is @xmath30 au / myr ( section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "it appears that these early estimates are not aligned with modern determinations , and may have been caused by erroneous or insufficient astrometry .",
    "more recently , @xcite searched for yarkovsky signatures and reported rate estimates for 12 candidates .",
    "here we use new developments in star catalog debiasing  @xcite as well as the most recent astrometric data to compute semi - major drift rates for select neas , which multiplies the number of existing measurements by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "observations of yarkovsky rates can be used to place constraints on composition ( i.e.  metal vs.  rock ) , physical properties ( i.e.  bulk density ) , and spin properties ( i.e.  prograde vs.  retrograde ) .",
    "the magnitude of the force is dependent on the object s mass , size , obliquity , spin rate , and surface thermal properties .",
    "separating how each of these quantities uniquely contributes to a measured @xmath21 is often not possible , but past yarkovsky detections have allowed for insight into the associated objects . with certain assumptions on surface thermal properties , bulk densities were determined from the measured drifts of golevka @xcite and ( 152563 ) 1992 bf @xcite .",
    "for the latter , the magnitude and direction of the drift point to an obliquity in excess of 120 degrees  @xcite .",
    "the yarkovsky drift manifests itself primarily as a change in mean anomaly ( or along - track position ) , and some observational circumstances are poorly suited to detect such changes .",
    "examples include optical astrometry secured when the line - of - sight is roughly parallel to the asteroid velocity vector or when the object is at large distances from earth . in both instances",
    "the differences in astrometric positions can be much smaller than observational uncertainties , resulting in low sensitivity to the yarkovsky effect .",
    "the overall yarkovsky sensitivity depends on the orbital geometry of the nea and on the entire set of available observations .",
    "this can be quantified rigorously . for each epoch @xmath31 at which optical observations were obtained ( @xmath32 ) , we predict the position @xmath33 for the best - fit orbit ( @xmath34 ) and the position @xmath35 for the same orbit modified by a nominal non - zero @xmath21 .",
    "the value of the nominal rate is not important as long as it results in detectable ( @xmath2arcsecond ) changes in coordinates and as long as it is applied consistently to all objects ; we used @xmath21=0.1 au / myr .",
    "we then define the _ yarkovsky sensitivity _ @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the positional uncertainty associated with observation @xmath39 .",
    "this root mean square quantity provides an excellent metric to assess the relative sensitivity of any given data set to a drift in semi - major axis , including drifts caused by yarkovsky influences .",
    "the metric can be applied to the entire set of available observations , or to the subset of observations that survive the outlier rejection steps described below .",
    "we computed both quantities and used the latter for our analysis .",
    "we found that data sets with scores @xmath36 below unity yield unreliable results , including artificially large rates and large error bars .",
    "out of @xmath21,250 numbered neas , only @xmath2300 have @xmath40 and @xmath2150 have @xmath41 . in this paper",
    "we focus on a subset of these neas .      for this work we employed orbital fits to optical astrometry to determine semi - major axis drift rates for neas .",
    "we used the orbfit software package , which is developed and maintained by the orbfit consortium @xcite .",
    "orbfit can fit nea trajectories to astrometric data by minimizing the root mean square of the weighted residuals to the data , optionally taking into account a given non - zero rate of change in semi - major axis @xmath21 .",
    "we included perturbations from 21 asteroids whose masses were estimated by @xcite .",
    "we downloaded optical astrometry for all numbered minor planets ( numobs.txt.gz ) from the minor planet center ( mpc ) on january 31st , 2012 .",
    "we have assumed that all the astrometry has been properly converted to the j2000 system .",
    "the quality of the astrometry varies greatly , and we applied the data weighting and debiasing techniques implemented in orbfit , which appear to follow the recommendations of @xcite .",
    "data weights are based on the time the observation was performed , the method of the observation ( ccd or plate ) , the accuracy of the star catalog , and in some cases the accuracy of the observatory .",
    "correction for known star catalog biases was applied when possible .",
    "biases vary depending on the specific star catalog and region of the sky , and can reach 1.5 arcseconds in both right ascension ( r.a . ) and declination ( dec . ) .",
    "correction for these biases can substantially improve the recovery of orbital parameters from observations .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , not every observation can be debiased .",
    "some observations were reported to the mpc without noting the star catalog used in the data reduction .",
    "although @xcite deduced the star catalogs used by several major surveys , there remain observations from smaller observatories that do not have associated star catalogs . accordingly , a fraction of the astrometry used in this paper was not debiased . based on counts published @xcite",
    ", we estimate this fraction to be less than 7.2% of all the observations .",
    "our procedure for determining the semi - major axis drift rate included three steps : an initial fit to the debiased data , an outlier rejection step , and a search for the best - fit @xmath21 , with iteration of the last two steps when necessary .",
    "we used the orbital elements from the minor planet center s mpcorb database as initial conditions for the first fit for each object ( step 1 ) .",
    "this first fit , performed with @xmath42 and outlier rejection turned off , slightly corrected the orbital elements for our weighted , debiased observations .",
    "the orbital elements from each object s first fit became the starting orbital elements for all later fits of that object .",
    "the second fit of each object served to reject outliers and was initially performed with @xmath42 ( step 2 ) . the residual for each observation",
    "was calculated using the usual observed ( o ) minus computed ( c ) quantities : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the uncertainties for that observation in r.a .  and",
    ", respectively .",
    "we rejected observations when their @xmath46 , and recovered previously rejected observations at @xmath47 , with the rejection step iterated to convergence .",
    "results are fairly robust over a large range of thresholds for rejection ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "if the post - fit residuals were normally distributed , the chosen thresholds would result in @xmath48 of observations being rejected as outliers . because errors are not normally distributed , our typical rejection rates are 2 - 5% of all available astrometry .",
    "this second fit produced the set of observations which were used in the third step .",
    "the third step was a series of orbital element fits to the observations over a set of fixed @xmath21 values . during these fits",
    ", we used the set of observations defined by the second fit and did not allow further outlier rejection .",
    "the quality of a fit was determined by summing the squares of residuals @xmath49 . to locate the region with the lowest @xmath50",
    ", we used a three - point parabolic fit or the golden - section minimization routine  @xcite .",
    "a parabola was then fit to the @xmath50 curve in the vicinity of the minimum , and we used the minimum of the parabola to identify the best - fit @xmath21 value .",
    "confidence limits were estimated using @xmath50 statistics .",
    "confidence regions of 68.3% and 95.4% ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively ) were established by the range of @xmath21 values that yielded @xmath50 values within 1.0 and 4.0 of the best - fit @xmath50 value , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2100chi ] ) .",
    "value to optical astrometry of ( 2100 ) ra - shalom ( 1,281 observation epochs , 2,562 observations , 7 adjustable parameters , 2,555 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the sums of squares of residuals corresponding to a range of @xmath21 values are shown as circles , with a parabolic fit shown as a dotted line .",
    "the @xmath21 values plotted here were determined by the golden section search algorithm @xcite as it searched for and found a minimum at @xmath53 au / myr with a reduced @xmath50 value of @xmath54 .",
    "confidence limits of @xmath55 ( @xmath51 ) are indicated by the thick dashed line , and correspond to the range @xmath56 \\times            10^{-4}$ ] au / myr .",
    "the thin dashed line shows the 95.4% ( @xmath52 ) confidence region .",
    "[ fig:2100chi ] ]    the initial outlier rejection step can in some cases eliminate valid observations simply because the yarkovsky influences are not captured in a dynamical model with @xmath34 . to circumvent this difficulty , we iterated the outlier rejection step with the best - fit @xmath21 value and we repeated the fitting process . in 52 out of 54 cases ,",
    "the new best - fit value matched the previous best - fit value to within @xmath51 , and we accepted the new best - fit values as final .",
    "for the other objects we repeated the reject and fit processes until successive best - fit values converged within @xmath51 ( which never required more than one additional iteration ) .",
    "our results report the @xmath21 values obtained at the end of this iterative process .",
    "we restricted our study to numbered neas with the best yarkovsky sensitivity ( equation  [ eq - sy ] ) , specifically @xmath57 ( fig .  [ fig - xmas ] ) .",
    "we also chose to focus on objects with non - zero @xmath21 values by using a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) metric , defined as the ratio of the best - fit @xmath21 to its @xmath51 uncertainty .",
    "we accepted all objects with snr @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - xmas ] ) .",
    "some asteroids have observations that precede the majority of the object s astrometry by several decades and have relatively high uncertainties . in order to test the robustness of our results , we removed these sparse observations , which were defined as ten or fewer observations over a 10-year period .",
    "fits were then repeated for these objects without the early observations .",
    "if the initial best - fit value fell within the @xmath51 error bars of the new best - fit value , the initial result was accepted , otherwise , the object was rejected .",
    "superior detections of the yarkovsky effect are likely favored with longer observational arcs , larger number of observations , and good orbital coverage .",
    "for this reason we limited the sample to those neas with an observational arc at least 15 years long , with a number of reported observations exceeding 100 , and with at least 8 observations per orbit on at least 5 separate orbits .",
    "we report on the 54 objects that met all of these criteria : sensitivity , snr , sparse test , and orbital coverage .",
    "we validated our optical - only technique whenever radar ranging observations were available on at least two apparitions .",
    "this could only be done for a fraction of the objects in our sample . in the remainder of this paper , _ optical - only _",
    "results are clearly distinguished from _",
    "radar+optical _ results . for the radar+optical fits",
    ", we included all available radar astrometry and disallowed rejection of potential radar outliers .",
    "the internal consistency of radar astrometry is so high that outliers are normally detected before measurements are reported .",
    "we also verified that a fitting procedure that holds successive @xmath21 values constant is equivalent to performing 7-parameter fits ( 6 orbital parameters and @xmath21 simultaneously ) .",
    "the @xmath21 values obtained with both procedures are consistent with one another .",
    "in addition to the measurements described above , we produced numerical estimates of the diurnal yarkovsky drift for each of the objects in our sample . comparing the measured and estimated rates",
    "provides a way to test yarkovsky models . in some instances , e.g. ,  robust observations irreconcilable with accurate yarkovsky modeling",
    ", it could also lead to the detection of other non - gravitational forces , such as cometary activity .",
    "our numerical estimates were generated as follows . at each timestep , we computed the diurnal yarkovsky acceleration according to equation ( 1 ) of @xcite , which assumes a spherical body , with the physical parameters  @xcite listed in table [ tab - thercon ] and an assumption of 0@xmath59 or 180@xmath59 obliquity .",
    "we assumed that the thermal conductivity did not have a temperature dependence , but found that adding a temperature - dependent term according to the prescription of @xcite ( @xmath60 , with @xmath61 ) did not change our predictions by more than 1% .",
    "we then resolved the acceleration along orthogonal directions , and used gauss form of lagrange s planetary equations @xcite to evaluate an orbit - averaged @xmath21 .",
    "the physical parameters chosen for these predictions mimic two extremes of rocky asteroids ; one is intended to simulate a rubble pile with low bulk density , the other a regolith - free chunk of rock ( table [ tab - thercon ] ) .",
    "these parameters correspond to a thermal inertia range of @xmath62 j  m@xmath63  s@xmath64  k@xmath65 , enveloping the results of @xcite , who found an average nea thermal inertia to be @xmath66  j  m@xmath63  s@xmath64  k@xmath65 . in most cases ,",
    "the drift rates produced by these two extreme cases encompass the drift produced by a rubble - pile object that has a regolith - free surface , or the drift produced by a solid object with regolith .",
    "lcccc composition & @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) & @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) & @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) & @xmath13 ( @xmath72 ) + rubble pile & 500 & 0.01 & 1200 & 1200 + rock chunk & 500 & 0.50 & 2000 & 2000 +    there is no simple relationship between these physical parameters and predicted drift rates , but for most cases the rubble pile exhibits the larger @xmath21 values due to its low bulk density ( equation  [ equ : dadttyp ] ) .",
    "the smaller values of density of the surface and thermal conductivity for rubble piles produce a smaller thermal inertia , and therefore a longer thermal lag . generally , but not always , this longer thermal lag , combined with the rotation of the asteroid , allows for a larger fraction of departing thermal emission to be aligned with the asteroid s velocity , resulting in a larger drift .",
    "when available , measured values of the geometric albedo , diameter , and spin rate from the jpl small - body database @xcite were incorporated into our predictions for yarkovsky drifts . when not available , the diameter @xmath12 in km was estimated from the absolute magnitude @xmath73 using @xcite , @xmath74 where we used two values of the v - band geometric albedo @xmath75 ( 0.05 and 0.45 ) , a range that captures observed albedos for the majority of neas .",
    "when spin rate was unknown , we assumed a value of 5 revolutions / day , based on the average spin rate values for asteroids 1 to 10 km in diameter shown in fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "emissivity was assumed to be 0.9 .",
    "bond albedo was estimated with a uniform value of the phase integral ( q=0.39 ) on the basis of the iau two - parameter magnitude system for asteroids @xcite and an assumed slope parameter g=0.15 .",
    "we have assumed @xmath76 for the purpose of quantifying the yarkovsky efficiency when the asteroid size was unknown .",
    "we measured the semi - major axis drift rate of all 1,252 numbered neas known as of march 2012 . some of the drift rates are not reliable because of poor sensitivity to yarkovsky influences ( fig .",
    "[ fig - xmas ] ) .     plotted as a function of semi - major axis drift rate @xmath21 for 1,252 numbered neas .",
    "data sets with yarkovsky sensitivity below unity ( dashed line ) yield unreliable results , including large rates and large error bars .",
    "our selection criteria require @xmath57 ( dotted line ) and snr @xmath77 .",
    "the 80 objects that meet both selection criteria are shown in green .",
    "about 26 of these 80 neas are eliminated by the sparse test and orbital coverage requirements ( see section  [ sec - select]).,width=480 ]    after our process of selection and elimination ( section  [ sec - select ] ) , we were left with 54 neas that exhibit some of the most reliable and strongest drift rates .",
    "although we report objects with @xmath57 , we have the most confidence in objects with highest yarkovsky sensitivity , and we show objects in order of decreasing @xmath36 value in our figures .",
    "we examined the impact of various choices of reject / recover thresholds when rejecting outlier observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rejectrecover ] ) . at moderate values of the rejection threshold ( i.e.  eliminating less than @xmath25% of observations ) , best - fit values are consistent with one another . in this regime , results are fairly robust against the choice of rejection thresholds . however results do become sensitive to rejection thresholds when a larger fraction of observations is rejected . as the reject",

    "our adopted reject / recover thresholds ( @xmath78/@xmath79 ) are stringent enough that they eliminate obvious outliers , but not so stringent as to suppress the yarkovsky signal . in 52 out of 54 cases , repeating the outlier rejection step with the best - fit @xmath21 value resulted in no appreciable change to the result .    ) on the best - fit @xmath21 values .",

    "this could be due to inaccuracies in our knowledge of physical properties , faulty astrometry , or modeling errors . ]",
    "in this section we examine several consequences of our results .",
    "first we discuss how the yarkovsky drifts can inform us about asteroid physical properties , spin states , and trajectories .",
    "then we discuss binary asteroid ( 1862 ) apollo and the curious case of asteroid ( 1036 ) ganymed .",
    "finally we discuss the possible mechanisms for non - yarkovsky driven rates , including association with meteoroid streams and rock comet phenomenon .",
    "because a clear connection exists between asteroid physical properties and yarkovsky drifts , we explored the constraints that can be placed on bulk density and surface thermal conductivity for seven objects with well - known diameters and ( excepting one case ) spin periods : ( 1620 ) geographos , ( 1862 ) apollo , ( 2100 ) ra - shalom , ( 2062 ) aten , ( 2340 ) hathor , ( 1566 ) icarus , and ( 3361 ) orpheus .",
    "we compared the measured yarkovsky rates to numerical estimates obtained with a range of physical parameters .",
    "for these estimates , we assumed a constant heat capacity @xmath124 j kg@xmath65 k@xmath65 ( table [ tab - thercon ] ) and a single value of the bulk density of the surface @xmath125 kg  m@xmath20 , but we explore a wide range of bulk density and surface thermal conductivity values . because the obliquities are uncertain or ambiguous in many cases , we chose to illustrate outcomes for two obliquity values , typically 180@xmath59 and 135@xmath59 .",
    "our results are shown in figures  [ fig : rhoka ] and [ fig : rhokb ] , which are similar to fig . 4 in @xcite .",
    "the shaded range consistent with the @xmath51 confidence limits on @xmath21 delineates the space of acceptable bulk densities and thermal conductivities , assuming that the yarkovsky effect is being modeled correctly . by acceptable ,",
    "we mean consistent with observed @xmath21 values , even though some of the @xmath126 values may not be appropriate for asteroids .",
    "infrared observations indicate that ( 2100 ) ra - shalom has a thermal conductivity between 0.1 and 1 w  m@xmath65  k@xmath65 @xcite . if we assume a minimum bulk density of 1,500 kg  m@xmath20 , this conductivity value is consistent with the range suggested by our yarkovsky rate determination .",
    "if we make the same minimum density assumption for ( 1620 ) geographos , our measurements suggest that its surface thermal conductivity is greater than 0.002 w  m@xmath65  k@xmath65 .    for ( 1862 )",
    "apollo , we show the range of physical properties that are consistent with both the optical - only fits and the radar+optical fits .",
    "the precision of the radar measurements dramatically shrinks the size of the measured error bars , with correspondingly tighter constraints on density and surface thermal conductivity .",
    "this example illustrates that reliable obliquity determinations will be important to extract physical properties from yarkovsky rate determinations .    our measurement of ( 2062 ) aten",
    "s drift provides some useful insights . if we assume that its bulk density exceeds @xmath127",

    "hathor were computed with an assumed spin period of 4.5 hours .",
    "if the actual period is longer , the curves shown would shift to the left , and if the period is shorter , the curves would shift to the right .",
    "consequently , we can not make inferences about the @xmath69 value for this object until its spin period is measured .",
    "however , looking at the height of the curve , and with an assumption that the object s bulk density is greater than @xmath127 kg  m@xmath20 , we can conclude that ( 2340 ) hathor likely has an obliquity lower than @xmath117 .",
    "the assumption of @xmath130 or @xmath117 obliquity for ( 1566 ) icarus restricts this object to low surface conductivity values and low bulk density values , or high surface conductivity values and high bulk density values . although these obliquities do produce physically plausible parameter combinations , it seems likely that the obliquity for this object is @xmath131 .    the curves for ( 3361 ) orpheus were calculated with an assumed geometric albedo of 0.15 . as ( 3361 ) orpheus has a positive @xmath21 value , obliquities were assumed to be @xmath116 and @xmath132 .",

    "we estimated the along - track displacement of ( 101955 ) 1999  rq36 over the 6-month duration of the osiris - rex mission to be @xmath148 km , which will be easily detectable by a radio science instrument .",
    "\\(1862 ) apollo is a binary asteroid  @xcite .",
    "binary asteroids present a unique opportunity for the determination of physical parameters .",
    "if mass and density can be measured from the binary orbit and component sizes , the yarkovsky constraint on thermal conductivity can become much more meaningful .",

    ", actual obliquity measurements can be obtained from shape modeling efforts .",

    "to @xmath51 our observed @xmath21 value for ( 1862 ) apollo agrees with our yarkovsky predictions .",
    "\\(1036 ) ganymed has by far the largest yarkovsky efficiency value ( @xmath149 ) among the objects presented in table [ tbl - results ] . with a nominal value of @xmath150 au / myr ,",
    "the measured @xmath21 value is comparable to that of other neas .",
    "combined with ganymed s large diameter estimate ( @xmath151 km based on iraf measurements ) , this yarkovsky rate results in an unusually high @xmath1 value .",
    "how can this anomaly be explained ?",
    "one possibility is that some of the early astrometry , dating back to 1924 , is erroneous .",
    "this could be due to measurement errors , timing errors , bias errors , or reference frame conversion errors .",
    "we evaluated the semi - major axis drift with various subsets of the available astrometry and found values ranging between @xmath152 and @xmath153 au / myr . on that basis",
    "we modified the adopted uncertainties for this object , and our preferred value is @xmath154 au / myr .",
    "doing so does not eliminate the possibility of systematic bias in the astrometry , and we are still left with anomalously high @xmath1 values .",
    "another possibility is that the diameter of ganymed , an s - type asteroid , is much smaller than reported .",
    "this seems unlikely considering the more recent wise albedo measurement of @xmath155 @xcite which suggests a diameter of @xmath156 km .",
    "if ganymed s bulk density was especially low , a higher than usual @xmath1 value would be expected , but this would likely explain a factor of 2 or 3 at most , and would not explain the anomalous value .",
    "perhaps ganymed departs significantly from a spherical shape , with an effective diameter and mass that are much smaller than those implied by the diameter values reported in the literature .",
    "the relatively low lightcurve amplitudes do not seem to support such an argument , unless the asteroid is particularly oblate . in that case",
    "one could plausibly arrive at volume and mass estimates that are off by a factor of 5 - 10 .",
    "if we can rule out these possibilities ( i.e.  ganymed is roughly spherical with no substantial concavities , its diameter estimate is reasonably accurate , and the early astrometry can be trusted ) , and if no other modeling error can be identified , then we would be compelled to accept an anomalously high yarkovsky efficiency for this object .",
    "in the course of our study we observed drift values that can not be accounted for easily by yarkovsky drift , because they considerably exceed the predicted yarkovsky rates .",
    "in most cases , these can be attributed to poor sensitivity to yarkovsky influences ( fig .",
    "[ fig - xmas ] ) .",
    "therefore , the high rates can generally be safely discarded . in other cases",
    ", the high rates may be due to erroneous optical astrometry or mismodeling of asteroid - asteroid perturbations .",
    "however we can not entirely rule out the possibility that some of the high drift rates are secure and will be confirmed by further observation and analysis . if the high rates can not be ascribed to poor yarkovsky sensitivity or faulty astrometry , one would need to invoke other non - gravitational forces .",
    "one possibility is that orbits are perturbed when neas are losing gas or dust in an anisotropic manner . to estimate a rough rate of mass loss that would be needed to account for the drifts measured , we used the basic thrust equation @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the force",
    ", @xmath159 is the rate at which the mass departs the asteroid , and @xmath160 is the ejection speed . for an asteroid of mass @xmath161",

    "the dependence of the force on heliocentric distance @xmath163 is not known precisely ; we assumed @xmath164 , similar to the yarkovsky dependence , for simplicity , and because the amount of outgassing likely scales with the amount of incident radiation ( as in fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "we assumed @xmath165 m s@xmath65 , the value derived by @xcite for 133p / elst - pizarro , and we assumed that the mass is departing in the optimal thrust direction .",
    "we quantified the mass loss rates needed to produce the observed drifts of neas with the highest yarkovsky efficiencies .",
    "we estimated a rate of 0.16  kg s@xmath65 for ( 154330 ) 2002 vx94 and 2.3 kg s@xmath65 for ( 7889 ) 1994 lx . although these estimates represent the minimum amount of mass loss necessary to account for the observed drifts ( if due to mass loss ) , they are smaller than typical levels from comets .",
    "comets have mass loss rates that span a wide range of values . on the high side a rate of @xmath166 kg s@xmath65 was estimated for hale - bopp @xcite . on the low side",
    "@xcite measured mass loss rates for three comets , averaged over their orbits : 2p / encke ( @xmath167 kg s@xmath65 ) , 22p / kopff ( @xmath168 kg s@xmath65 ) , and 65p / gunn ( @xmath169 kg s@xmath65 ) .",
    "mass loss rates of active asteroids have been estimated to be in the range from @xmath170 kg s@xmath65 ( 113p / elst - pizarro ) to @xmath171 kg s@xmath65 ( 107p / wilson - harrington ) @xcite .",
    "mass loss does not seem to be a viable mechanism to explain the semi - major axis drift rate of ( 1036 ) ganymed , as it would require a minimum mass loss rate of @xmath22,500 kg s@xmath65 .",

    "the yarkovsky force is therefore a plausible cause of apollo s observed semi - major axis drift .",
    "the brightening of ( 3200 ) phaethon , the parent body of the geminid meteor shower , has been attributed to a `` rock comet '' phenomenon @xcite . with a perihelion at 0.14 au , ( 3200 )",

    "the combination of mass loss due to decomposing hydrated minerals and thermal fracturing led the authors to term ( 3200 ) phaethon a `` rock comet '' . a moderate amount ( @xmath2 1 kg s@xmath65 ) of mass lost in an anisotropic manner by `` rock comets '' could explain the observed semi - major axis drift rates .",
    "modeling of the yarkovsky effect is needed to improve trajectory predictions of near - earth asteroids and to refine our understanding of the dynamics of small bodies . using fits to astrometric data , we identified semi - major axis drifts in 54 neas , 42 of which show good agreement with numerical estimates of yarkovsky drifts , indicating that they are likely yarkovsky - dominated .",
    "these objects exhibit yarkovsky efficiencies of @xmath210@xmath3 , where the efficiency describes the ratio of the change in orbital energy to incident solar radiation energy .",
    "12 objects in our sample have drifts that exceed nominal yarkovsky predictions and are labeled possibly yarkovsky - dominated .",
    "improvements in the knowledge of physical properties or in thermal modeling could bring these drift rates in better agreement with results from numerical models .",

    "<S> this agreement suggests that the yarkovsky effect is the dominant non - gravitational process affecting these orbits , and allows us to derive constraints on asteroid physical properties . in 12 cases , </S>",
    "<S> the drifts exceed nominal yarkovsky predictions , which could be due to inaccuracies in our knowledge of physical properties , faulty astrometry , or modeling errors . if these high rates can not be ruled out by further observations or improvements in modeling , they would be indicative of the presence of an additional non - gravitational force , such as that resulting from a loss of mass of order a kilogram per second . </S>",
