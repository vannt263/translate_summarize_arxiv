    "there have been strong recent interests in spin effects in semiconductors for applications in spintronics  @xcite .",
    "particularly , spin splittings due to bulk inversion asymmetry  @xcite ( bia)arising from the different chemical character of the anion and the cation in the zinc blende structure  and structural inversion asymmetry  @xcite ( sia)appearing in layered structures where `` top '' is different from `` down '' : asymmetric composition , doping , etc. , are studied because a good understanding of the intraband spin splittings is essential in any attempt to understand the operation of spintronic devices at a microscopic level , since they determine the spin dynamics during relaxation and transport processes  @xcite .",
    "the pioneering work by dresselhaus  @xcite , bychkov and rashba  @xcite , and dyakonov and kachorovski@xcite taught us the functional form of the leading order contributions  up to first ( third ) order in the wavevector * k * for sia ( bia)to the spin hamiltonians in bulk and heterostructure zinc blendes due to the various sources of inversion asymmetry .",
    "this constructive procedure is of great use as it describes the main physics but , as shown below , @xmath2",
    "contributions for heterostructures due to bia  @xcite should contain additional terms , while the @xmath2 contributions arising from sia have not been studied .",
    "thus , it is also important to have a systematic modeling tool which guarantees that all spin - related qualitative features in the band structures will be present . the empirical tight - binding method as formulated by slater and koster  @xcite provides such a systematic way of generating all the symmetry - allowed terms that can appear in a hamiltonian .",
    "it has been used extensively in the computation of bulk , heterostructure and surface properties , and today finds widespread use in the study of nanostructures involving thousands and even millions of atoms  @xcite , or transport properties  @xcite .",
    "however , the original formulation by slater and koster was obtained through the use of single group symmetry operations , which prevented it from describing spin effects .",
    "later , chadi  @xcite extended the original method with an on - site spin - orbit energy which effectively describes the zone center split - off splitting and breaks the double degeneracy of the bands for systems without an inversion center .",
    "this scheme contains the essential features of spin - orbit interaction , but does not reproduce some qualitative aspects such as the linear spin splitting in valence bands in zinc blendes  @xcite .",
    "boykin  @xcite has introduced supplementary matrix elements between nearest - neighbor atomic orbitals as a remedy for zinc blende structures , but that procedure does not guarantee _ a priori _ that all spin - orbit effects will be considered , and does not treat systematically other types of structures . the development presented in this paper",
    "allows us to address these issues precisely .    in this article",
    ", we compute the forms of sia and bia contributions to the spin hamiltonian of common heterostructures , beyond the conventional rashba  @xcite and dresselhaus  @xcite terms , to an arbitrary order in the wavevector * k*. this allows us to treat sia on the same footing as bia , providing higher order corrections to the rashba hamiltonian for [ 001 ] ( @xmath3 ) , [ 110 ] ( @xmath4 ) and [ 111 ] ( @xmath5 ) diamond and zinc blende quantum wells .",
    "we achieve this by following the constructive process of slater and koster  @xcite ( sk ) , but using double group irreducible representations ( irreps ) as opposed to single group irreps .",
    "we also apply the method to the generation of bulk zinc blende ( @xmath1 ) hamiltonians in the anion / cation and effective bond orbital model ( ebom )  @xcite basis sets containing full spin - orbit effects .",
    "the procedure presented could , of course , also be used for the description of the bands of materials involving heavy elements ( i.e. large relativistic effects ) , such as lead compounds , rare earths , etc .",
    "in order to achieve our goal of constructing spin hamiltonians to arbitrary order in the wavevector * k * , we first construct the tight binding hamiltonian for the corresponding point group symmetry using the ebom basis , and then series - expand in * k * to the desired order . also ,",
    "since we are interested in the correct description of relativistic and , in particular , spin effects in the electronic bands , we are led naturally to the use of double group irreps  @xcite to describe the symmetry operations of the crystal .",
    "thus , if we follow the sk procedure  @xcite using double as opposed to single groups , we will be assured to obtain the most general hamiltonian compatible with the crystal symmetries which , by construction , will include all spin - orbit effects .",
    "the basis states of double group irreps are much less amenable to brute force operation than their single group counterparts .",
    "therefore , it becomes necessary to write the tight binding equations and the symmetry constraints of the parameters in a form that allows computer manipulation .",
    "this is done in appendices  [ ssec : etb_review ] and  [ ssec : symm_cons ] which , while rederiving the empirical tight - binding basic results , also set forth the notation that will be employed throughout the rest of the paper , and help establish a better connection with previous authors conventions . for our actual double group calculations we use the matrices @xmath6 as provided by shirai  @xcite , which correspond to the ones tabulated by onodera and okazaki  @xcite .",
    "in order to illustrate the procedure with a familiar example , and for comparison purposes , we construct in sec .",
    "[ ssec : sg_zb ] a 4-band model with no spin included for a zinc blende ( point group @xmath1 ) using an effective bond orbital basis set .",

    "finally , we show explicitly in sec .",
    "[ ssec : ebokp ] the equivalence between the lwdin orbitals ( los ) centered at the primitive cell sites [ effective bond orbitals ( ebos ) ] and the zone center solutions of the  theory .",
    "the definition of the symbols appearing in the following tables can be found in equations ( [ eq : phi_k_melem ] ) and ( [ eq : etb_pars ] ) in appendix  [ ssec : etb_review ] .",
    "the phase of the parameters @xmath7the hamiltonian matrix elements between a state @xmath8 at the origin and a state @xmath9 at * r*has been factored out in the calculations of the tables .",
    "thus , all @xmath7 are real . parameters appearing in different tables are of course unrelated , while the procedure in appendix  [ ssec : symm_cons ] guarantees a high degree of independence within the parameters in any one table .",
    "we will study the top valence and lowest conduction bands of a zinc blende ( point group @xmath1 ) , which have @xmath10 and @xmath11 symmetry at the zone center ( we will use the kdws notation  @xcite throughout this paper for the irrep labels ) . we consider only coupling to the twelve nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "since we are working with effective bond orbitals located at _ fcc _ lattice sites , the nearest neighbors are at ( @xmath12 ) and its equivalent positions .",
    "table  [ tab : td_single ] shows the matrix elements .",
    "the use of the arguments in appendix  [ ssec : symm_cons ] shows for example that , with our choice of phases , the whole block @xmath13 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : etb_pars ] ) for meaning ] is purely real  which is otherwise trivially obtainable since the hamiltonian without so is real and the @xmath14 orbitals have the same ( imaginary ) phase  and that @xmath15 .",

    "this is important because the rashba contribution can be tuned through the action of a gate bias , and it is in principle possible to make the first order spin splitting vanish , suppressing the dp spin relaxation mechanism for all components at the same time  @xcite .      here",
    "we will construct the model equivalent to the @xmath26 block in sec .",
