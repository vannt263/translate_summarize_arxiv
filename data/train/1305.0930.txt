    "* for a comprehensive review ) . on the theoretical front",
    ", the problem arises from incomplete knowledge of the composition and equation of state ( eos ) of matter in the ns core at supernuclear densities ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "many possibilities can be realized : depending on the composition the eos can be either _ soft _ or _ stiff _ , where the stiffness characterizes the compressibility of matter , and strongly depends on the internal degrees of freedom of the system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , for a polytropic eos , @xmath1 , a larger adiabatic index @xmath2 yields stiffer eos .",
    "such an eos generally produces larger maximum masses and radii of nss than its softer counterpart .",
    "softer eoss can be obtained by the introduction of phase transitions in the theory where the core of the ns may be composed of boson condensates , quark or hyperonic matter .",
    "however , the presence of these at nuclear densities has been ruled out from the observation of a @xmath3 ns @xcite .",
    "the cooling behavior of nss depends very sensitively on the composition of the inner core , such that it affects the choice of the neutrino cooling process that is dominant in the first @xmath4 of its evolution ( see for e.g. * ? ? ? * for a detailed description of all the neutrino emission processes in nss ) .",
    "x - ray observations of isolated cooling nss have been crucial in their discovery ( see for e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , these observations present its own set of challenges in determining their cooling rate . here",
    ", one is interested in detecting radiation emanating from the surface of the ns which , in the case of pulsars , is complicated by the non - thermal emission from the magnetosphere .",
    "also , the non - uniform heating of the crust due to energetic particles accelerated in the magnetosphere render accurate determination of effective temperatures hard ( see for e.g. the review by * ? ? ? * on surface emission from nss ) .",
    "the unknown composition of ns atmospheres leads to the overestimation of their temperatures when fitting their spectra with a blackbody ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "apart from the uncertainties involved in the spectral modelling of ns surface emission , uncertainties in their distances can also contribute to poor effective temperature and luminosity estimates .",
    "furthermore , to place observed isolated sources on cooling curves , accurate ages are needed that may be hard to obtain as we discuss below .    in this study , we show that , for a large sample , ages of isolated thermal emitters can be derived from statistical arguments .",

    "[ sec : ages ] .",
    "lastly , we discuss the possibility of improving the meager sample of isolated thermal emitters by detecting more such objects in the upcoming erosita all - sky survey .",
    "nearby isolated cooling neutron stars are particularly important for confronting cooling models with observations .",
    "they were discovered by einstein , rosat , and asca space telescopes @xcite , and were further observed with the extremely sensitive and high resolution high - energy space telescopes chandra and xmm - newton . among all the discovered objects , the most interesting are the seven radio - quiet thermally emitting isolated nss ( a.k.a . the magnificent seven , m7 ) discovered in the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) ( see for e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "these radio - quiet objects radiate predominantly in x - rays with high x - ray to optical flux ratios , @xmath5 .",
    "their soft x - ray spectra are reasonably well fit by an absorbed blackbody - like spectrum with @xmath6 ev and a hydrogen column density @xmath7 , indicating small distances @xmath8 pc .",
    "astrometric measurements of some of the member objects independently confirm the distances inferred from column densities ( see references in table [ tbl : m7table ] ) . that the thermal emission is coming from majority of the stellar surface",
    "is confirmed by the small pulse fractions @xmath9 of the x - ray light curves .",
    "spin periods ranging from 3 - 12 s have been measured for all but one ( rx j1605.3 + 3249 ) of the m7 objects ( see for e.g. * ? ? ? * table [ tbl : m7table ] ) .",
    "this in conjunction with the measured spin - down rates , @xmath10 , yields an estimate of the polar magnetic field strengths @xmath11 g and the characteristic spin - down ages @xmath12 years @xcite",
    ". measurements of the high proper motions of three of the m7 objects and their association thus established to the sco ob2 complex comprising the gould belt yield kinematic and/or dynamical ages that are smaller than ages inferred from spin down @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between characteristic and kinematic ages strongly suggests that the spin - down ages are overestimates and the m7 objects in reality are much younger ( see for e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even when considering simple cooling models @xcite , one finds the spin - down ages to be @xmath13 times in excess of the cooling ages of @xmath14 @xcite .      according to the standard magnetic dipole model of pulsars @xcite , a rotating ns with a polar magnetic field spins down over time by emitting magnetic dipole radiation . from the rate of change of the angular frequency @xmath15 ,",
    "the spin - down age of the ns can be readily determined , with the assumption that the initial angular frequency is much larger than the present value ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 this assumption is invalid in the case of ccos as these objects are believed to have their initial periods very close to the current values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spin - down law implicitly assumes that none of the other physical characteristics of the pulsar vary over time .",
    "this may not be the case and , in general , the spin - down law @xcite written as the following can be allowed to include variation of @xmath18 , the moment of inertia @xmath19 , and the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic dipole axis @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is usually assumed to be a constant and @xmath23 is the _ braking index _ for magnetic dipole braking .",
    "any change in @xmath24 with time naturally yields ages of pulsars that are in conflict with their spin - down ages ; generally , the spin - down age should only be taken as a rough estimate to aid in calculations .",
    "an independent age estimate is provided by the age of the associated supernova remnant ( snr ) or massive star cluster for younger objects .",
    "establishing such an association for older nss may prove to be difficult since snrs fade away in @xmath25 kyr , and in the same time , due to natal kicks ( @xmath26 ) , nss may move significantly far away from their birth sites @xcite .",
    "we plot the spin - down and the estimated snr ages for young pulsars ( @xmath27 yrs ) , central compact objects ( ccos ) , and magnetars ( sgrs and axps ) along with their timing properties ( see for e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : snrvtc_fdecay ] , and it is clear that for many nss , that are not the typical spin - down powered radio pulsars , the characteristic age is a poor age estimator .",
    "the objects that have snr ages smaller than their spin - down ages can be explained by having a braking index less than the _ canonical _ value , @xmath28 .",
    "an excellent example supporting this notion is the vela pulsar which has a very small breaking index @xmath29 estimated from an impressive 25-year long observation @xcite , albeit under the assumption that @xmath24 is still a constant .",
    "this yields a spin - down age of 25.6 kyr , making it appear more than twice as old as its age inferred from the standard magnetic braking scenario .",
    "this result is well supported by the estimated age of the vela snr ( @xmath30 kyr ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for objects that have spin - down ages larger than that of their true ages , that may be inferred from their associated snr ages , it can be argued that the magnetic moments decrease in strength over time @xcite .",
    "there are three main mechanisms by which magnetic fields can decay in isolated ns , namely ohmic dissipation , ambipolar diffusion , and hall drift @xcite .",
    "the timescale over which the field decays substantially due to these processes ( see for e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )        determines the dominating process at different stages in the evolution of an isolated ns .",
    "an important consequence of field decay is that it leads to an overestimation of the real age of the ns .",

    "furthermore , this is a very general method which relies on only one underlying assumption that the objects are distributed according to their intrinsic brightnesses .    in the case of neutron stars ( unlike galaxies )",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the birthrate has been constant over the past few million years , and furthermore , the neutron stars progress from bright to faint luminosities as they age in the same ( albeit unknown ) way . under these assumptions",

    "the population synthesis method is given in our earlier study @xcite , and essentially requires the assumption of the luminosity function and spatial distribution of massive ob stars in the galaxy @xcite , and the distribution of hi , which we model as a smooth exponential disk both radially and vertically @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , local clumpiness of the ism will affect the level of absorption .",
    "thus , distances derived from assuming a homogeneous model will also be affected .",

    "the kinematic ages of these objects tell a different story , where rx j0720.4 - 3125 is older than rx j1856.5 - 3754 .",
    "this discrepancy results from the ordering of objects based on their model temperatures .",
    "if both objects are indeed very similar in their mass and surface composition , and have cooled not much differently , then the statistical ages would agree with rx j0720.4 - 3125 being younger .",
    "the ages of isolated nss are primarily important for constraining their inner structure .",
    "in addition , they can be useful for accurately determining the birthplace of the object , if its proper motion is known .",
    "similarly , if the snr - ns association has been made , then the age of the object can reveal its space velocity and the kinematics of the snr .",
    "the knowledge of ages of such objects is also useful for population synthesis models which rely on the spatial and velocity distributions , and the birthrates of nss . in this study , we propose a statistical method to estimate the true ages of the rosat discovered sample comprising the m7 .",
    "we then use the age estimates along with the derived spectral temperatures to compare the data with some cooling models . the strength of this technique , as discussed earlier , lies in obtaining a larger sample of _ coolers_. with only eight objects , the statistical error is indubitably much larger .    we have used the statistical ages and model temperatures of the nearby thermally emitting isolated nss to derive a cooling curve , under the assumption that all of the objects in the sample are similar in their mass and surface composition , and have also cooled in a similar fashion . due to the marginal size of the sample , with large statistical errors , it is not yet meaningful to differentiate between the different cooling models .",
    "however , this whole exercise shows that ages of such objects can be inferred statistically and provides another way of determining accurate ages in addition to ages obtained from kinematics and/or spin - down .",
    "the statistics can be improved by locating more of these objects in the disk of the galaxy . in a recent population synthesis study",
    ", @xcite find that young isolated nss , that are both hot and bright , with rosat count rates below @xmath160 ( the rosat bright source catalog had a limiting count rate of @xmath161 ) should be located in ob associations beyond the gould belt .",
    "they also remark on the possibility of finding new isolated cooling nss by conducting yet another careful search of such objects in the rass and the xmm - newton slew survey @xcite .",
    "however , they note that rosat observations are incapable at locating the isolated sources with sufficient spatial accuracy , such that many optical counterparts can be found in its large positional error circle . on the other hand",
    ", although xmm - newton is much more sensitive , albeit with strong inhomogeneities , and can probe deeper into the galactic plane , the slew survey only covers @xmath162 of the sky currently . searching the rass for new isolated nss may appear to be a promising avenue ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "what is needed at the moment is another all - sky survey that is able to surpass rosat in both sensitivity and positional accuracy . in that regard",
    ", the upcoming erosita mission @xcite shows a lot of promise , and its planned launch in 2014 makes it very timely .",
    "the x - ray instrument erosita will be part of the russian spectrum - roentgen - gamma ( srg ) satellite , equipped with seven wolter - i telescope modules with an advanced version of the xmm - newton pnccd camera at its prime focus .",
    "the telescope will operate with an energy range of @xmath163 kev , a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath164 , an angular resolution of @xmath165 averaged over the fov , and a limiting flux of @xmath166 in the @xmath167 kev energy range and @xmath168 in the @xmath169 kev energy range .",
    "the all - sky survey will reach sensitivities that are @xmath170 times that of the rass where the entire sky will scanned over a period of four years .",
