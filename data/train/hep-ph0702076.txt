    "the number of fermion generations , which is associated to the number of light neutrinos , is one of the most important predictions of the standard model of the electroweak interactions ( sm ) @xcite . in the sm",
    "the decay width of the @xmath7 boson into each neutrino family is calculated to be @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "additional generations , or other new weakly interacting particles with masses below @xmath10 , would lead to a decay width of the @xmath7 into invisible channels larger than the sm prediction for three families while a smaller value could be produced , for example , by the presence of one or more right - handed neutrinos mixed with the left - handed ones @xcite .",
    "thus the number of light neutrino generations @xmath5 , defined as the ratio between the measured invisible decay width of the @xmath7 , @xmath11 , and the sm expectation @xmath12 for each neutrino family , need not be an integer number and has to be measured with the highest possible accuracy .",
    "the most precise measurement of the number of light @xmath13 active neutrino types , and therefore the number of associated fermion families , comes from the invisible @xmath7 width @xmath11 , obtained by subtracting the observed width into quarks and charged leptons from the total width obtained from the lineshape . the number of effective neutrinos @xmath5 is given by @xcite    @xmath14    where @xmath15 , the sm expression for the ratio of widths into a charged lepton and a single active neutrino , is introduced to reduce the model dependence .",
    "the experimental value from the four lep experiments is @xmath5= 2.9841@xmath160.0083 @xcite , excluding the possibility of a fourth family unless the neutrino is very heavy or sterile .",
    "@xmath5 is the effective number of light neutrino generations deduced from the @xmath7 invisible width based on the expected partial width for one light neutrino generation ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with cosmological constraints on the number of relativistic species around the time of big bang nucleosynthesis , which seems to indicate the existence of three very light neutrino species @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the lep result measures precisely the slight deviations of @xmath5 from three .",
    "in particular , the most precise lep numbers can be translated into @xmath5 = 2.9841@xmath18 @xcite , about two sigma away from the sm expectation , @xmath5= 3 . while not statistically significant , this result suggests that the @xmath19-couplings might be suppressed with respect to the sm value @xcite .    using the experimental value for @xmath20 @xcite",
    ", we will determine the allowed region for @xmath3 as a function of the mixing angle @xmath4 and estimate bounds for the number of light neutrinos species in the framework of a left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) @xcite .",
    "we will also use the lep results to get a constraint on the lr mixing angle @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one assumes that the results for @xmath11 and @xmath21 for a future tesla - like giga-@xmath7 experiment agree with the central values obtained at lep , one would measure @xmath22 ( most conservative ) or @xmath23 ( most optimistic ) @xcite , in this case we estimate also a limit for the number of light neutrinos species .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present the expressions for the decay widths of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the lrsm . in sec .",
    "iii we present the numerical computation and , finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "in this section we calculate the partial widths for @xmath27 and @xmath28 using the transition amplitude given in ref .",

    "the square of the matrix elements becomes    @xmath35.\\ ] ]    our next step , now that we know the square of the eq .",

    "the partial widths eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are applicable to all charged leptons and all neutrinos respectively .",
    "in order to compare the respective expressions eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) with the experimental result for the number of light neutrinos species @xmath5 , we will use the definition for @xmath5 in a sm analysis @xcite ,    @xmath41    where the quantity in parenthesis is the standard model prediction and the @xmath42 factor is the experimental value of the ratio between the widths @xmath11 and @xmath21 @xcite ,",
    "@xmath43    this definition replaces the expression @xmath44 since ( 7 ) reduces the influence of the top quarks mass . to get information about what is the meaning of @xmath5 in the lrsm we should define the corresponding expression @xcite ,    @xmath45",
    "this new expression is a function of the mixing angle @xmath4 , so in this case the quantity defined as the number of light neutrinos species is not a constant and not necessarily an integer . also , @xmath3 in formula ( 8) is independent from the @xmath46 mass and therefore depends only of the mixing angle @xmath4 of the lrsm .",
    "experimental values for @xmath11 and for @xmath21 are reported in literature which , in our case , can give a bound for the angle @xmath4 .",
    "however , we can look to those experimental numbers in another way .",
    "the partial widths @xmath47 @xmath9 and @xmath48 @xmath9 were reported recently @xcite , but we use the value given by ( 8) for the @xmath42 rate of ref .",
    "all these measurements are independent of any model and can be fitted with the lrsm parameter @xmath3 in terms of @xmath4 .    in order to estimate a limit for the number of light neutrinos species @xmath49 in the framework of a left - right symmetric model",
    ", we plot the expression ( 8) to see the general behavior of the @xmath49 function , fig .",
    "1 . for the mixing angle @xmath4 between @xmath7 and @xmath46 , we use the reported data of maya _ et al . _",
    "@xcite :    @xmath50    with a @xmath51 c.l .",
    "other limits on the mixing angle @xmath4 reported in the literature are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this figure",
    "we observed that for the mixing angle @xmath4 , around 0.65 rad , @xmath49 can be as high as 5.9 , and for values of @xmath4 around -0.95 rad , @xmath49 is as low as 0 .",
    "this shows a strong dependence in @xmath4 for leptonic decays of the @xmath7 boson .",
    "therefore , according to the above discussion , if we consider @xmath49 as the number of neutrinos , the restriction on the number of species can be  softened \" if we consider a lrsm . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the allowed region for @xmath49 as a function of @xmath4 with @xmath51 c.l . the allowed region is the inclined band that is a result of both factors in eq .",
    "( 8) . in this figure @xmath52",
    "gives the inclination while @xmath42 gives the broading .",
    "this analysis was done using the experimental value given in eq .",
    "( 7 ) for @xmath42 reported by @xcite with a @xmath51 c.l . in the same figure",
    "we show the sm @xmath53 result at @xmath51 c.l . with the dashed horizontal lines .",
    "the allowed region in the lrsm ( dotted line ) for @xmath49 is wider that the one for the sm , and is given by :    @xmath54    whose center value is quite close to the standard model of three active neutrino species .    in the case of a future tesla - like giga-@xmath7 experiment",
    "we obtain the limits    @xmath55    which are consistent with those reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "finally , and just for completeness , we reverse the arguments that is , we fix the number of neutrinos in the lrsm to be three then the theoretical expression for @xmath56 will be given by    @xmath57    the plot of this quantity as function of the mixing angle @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "the horizontal lines give the experimental region at @xmath58 c.l . from the figure we observed that the constraint for the @xmath4 angle is :    @xmath59    which is about one order of magnitude stronger than the one obtained in previous studies of the lrsm @xcite .",
    "in the case of a future tesla - like giga-@xmath7 experiment we would obtain the following bounds for the mixing angle @xmath4 :    @xmath60",
    "we have determined a bound on the number of light neutrinos species in the framework of a left - right symmetric model as a function of the mixing angle @xmath4 , as shown in eq .",
    "( 10 ) and fig .",
    "2 . using this result and the lep values obtained for @xmath5 , we were able to put a limit on the lr mixing angle @xmath4 which is better than the one obtained in previous studies of these models .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that in the lrsm it is possible to obtain from the experimental results a value for @xmath5 different from 3 ( not necessarily an integer number ) . in particular for the left - right symmetric model with dirac neutrinos",
    ", @xmath3 is in the neighborhood of three .",
    "however , if new precision experiments find small deviations from three , this model may explain very well these deviations with a small value of @xmath4 .",
    "we have shown that new data of @xmath61 can considerably shrink the allowed region of @xmath62 . in the limit of @xmath63 ,",
    "our bounds takes the value previously reported in the literature @xcite .",
