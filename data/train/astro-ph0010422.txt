    "@xmath9 has brought an enormous progress in determining extragalactic distances by providing 26 cepheid distances to late - type galaxies .",
    "this is of paramount importance not only for the determination of the hubble constant @xmath17 , but increasingly also for the physical understanding of individual galaxies whose linear sizes , luminosities , masses , radiation densities etc .",
    "depend on distance .",
    "unfortunately the progress is confined to late - type galaxies , the distances of early - type galaxies having profited only indirectly .",
    "an overview of the cepheid distances from @xmath9 is given in table  1 .",
    "cepheids carry by far the largest weight for the foundation of the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "their zeropoint is based on an adopted lmc modulus of @xmath21 , which is confirmed by various distance indicators to within @xmath22 .",
    "cepheid distances are uncontroversial to a large extent with possibly remaining small metallicity effects discussed in section  2.5 .",
    ".cepheid distances from @xmath9 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     tonry et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) have derived @xmath23 from the sbf of 300 field galaxies with @xmath24 and on the basis of a very specific flow model .",
    "however , the usefulness of the sbf method has never been tested beyond doubt ; a hubble diagram of field galaxies and a corresponding determination of the intrinsic scatter of the method and hence of the importance of the malmquist bias are still missing .",
    "the authors state correctly `` the level of this malmquist - like bias in our sample is difficult to quantify  and we may also be subject to possible biases and selection effects which depend on distance . ''",
    "moreover , in discussing table  3 it was noted that the small relative sbf distance virgo - leo and the large value fornax - virgo are in serious contradiction to the evidence of cepheids and sneia .",
    "it is well possible that the sbf method is still affected by hidden second - parameter effects .",
    "the exceptionally tight hubble diagram of blue sneia out to @xmath25 combined with their mean absolute magnitude , which is determined from eight galaxies whose cepheid distances have been determined with @xmath9 , offers the ideal instrument for the calibration of the large - scale value of @xmath17 .",
    "the result is  after allowance is made for the relatively weak dependence of sneia luminosities on decline rate @xmath6 and color and for some small systematic effects ",
    "@xmath10 .",
    "the quoted external error is mainly determined by the calibrating cepheid distances . although cepheids are generally considered to be the most reliable distance indicators , certain questions remain as to their zeropoint calibration through lmc and the effect of metallicity variations .",
    "phillips et  al .  ( 1999 ) and suntzeff et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) have adopted a steeper relation between the sneia luminosity and the decline rate @xmath6 , which is not supported by the present larger sample .",
    "if their steep slope is taken at face value @xmath17 would be increased by 5 percent .",
    "gibson et  al .  ( 2000 ) have increased the cepheid distances of saha et  al .  and tanvir et  al .  in table  2 by @xmath26 on average on the basis of additional cepheids of lower weight .",
    "this would increase @xmath17 by another 5 percent .",
    "if one choses to cumulate the two effects one could defend a value of @xmath27 ( cf .",
    "freedman 2000 ) .",
    "the calibration of @xmath17 through the hubble diagram of clusters and through field galaxies in section  3 and 4 has given values around @xmath28 , i.e. somewhat smaller , if anything , than the value from sneia .",
    "since the latter offer the most direct way to @xmath17 , they are given the highest weight .",
    "a value of @xmath29 is therefore adopted as the best estimate available at present .",
    "the distance of the virgo cluster is still sometimes equated to the mean cepheid distance of three virgo spirals which are visibly on the near side of the cluster due to their high resolution into stars ,  in fact they had been preselected on grounds of their high resolution to facilitate work with @xmath9 .",
    "thus ,  even if the larger cluster distance of @xmath31 ( cf .",
    "table  4 and 5 ) was not required by a fourth cepheid distance of a bona fide cluster member ( ngc4639 ) and in addition by the three sneia and the tf relation ,  the three cepheid distances of highly resolved galaxies could set only _ a lower limit on the cluster distance _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath32 .    the distance of the virgo cluster has entered with high or even full weight into the zeropoint calibration of the d@xmath13 , fp , and sbf methods and occasionally even of the turnover magnitude of the gclf .",
    "( the significance of the gclf , although not yet proven beyond doubt , is just that the calibration rests on the cepheid distance of m31 _ and _ on the rr  lyr distances of galactic globular clusters [ cf .",
    "tammann & sandage 1999 ] ) .",
    "if one inserts in these cases too low a virgo cluster distance , one obtains incorrect values of @xmath33 , or even more , by necessity .",
    "locally calibrated distance indicators with non - negligible scatter can exclusively be applied to distance - limited samples ( or volume - limited samples in case of clusters ) , but only apparent - magnitude - limited samples are available , which frequently are not even complete to any specific magnitude limit .",
    "the statistical differences between a distance- and magnitude - limited sample are known for almost eighty years ( malmquist 1920 , 1922 ) , but this insight is violated again and again , always leading to too high values of @xmath17 .",
    "malmquist s message is that control of the objects missing out to a fixed distance from a magnitude - limited catalog is equally important as the catalog entries themselves .",
    "the future will see high - weight determinations of @xmath17 from the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , from gravitationally lensed quasars , and from the cmb fluctuations . at present",
    "these methods yield values of @xmath34 , which is not yet competitive with the solution of sneia . in the case of the cmb fluctuations",
    "one can solve for @xmath17 only in combination with other ( poorly known ) cosmological parameters .",
    "therefore an _ independent _ , high - accuracy determination of @xmath17 , to be used as a prior , is as important as ever .    * acknowledgement . *",
