    "general relativity provides a subtle and powerful interplay between gravity and geometry , thereby opening numerous possibilities for novel phenomena . among the most spectacular of the resulting conceptual advances",
    "are the predictions that the universe began with a big bang and massive stars can end their lives as black holes . in both cases ,",
    "one encounters singularities .",
    "space - time of general relativity literally ends and classical physics comes to a halt .",
    "however , general relativity is incomplete because it ignores quantum effects .",
    "it is widely believed that quantum gravity effects become significant in the high curvature regions that develop before singularities are formed .",
    "these are likely to significantly change the space - time structure , making the predictions of general relativity unreliable .",
    "hence , real physics need not stop at the big bang and black hole singularities .",
    "while the classical space - time does end there , quantum space - time may well extend beyond .",
    "attempts at extending physics beyond the big - bang singularity date back at least to the seventies when mini - superspaces were introduced and quantum cosmology was born ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these investigations sparked off new developments in different directions ranging from foundations of quantum mechanics to the development of wkb methods to test semi - classicality in quantum cosmology , to the introduction of novel euclidean methods to calculate the appropriate wave function of the universe .",
    "this deepened our understanding of issues related to the quantum physics of the universe as a whole @xcite .",
    "however , in these approaches the singularity was not generically resolved . a quantum extension of space - time either required the introduction of new principles @xcite , or ad - hoc assumptions , such as existence of matter violating energy conditions already at the classical level , or of external clocks that remain insensitive to the infinite curvature encountered at singularities .",
    "emergence of quantum riemannian geometry and the associated mathematical techniques @xcite have provided a new approach to revisit the issue of quantum extensions . within the mini - superspaces used in quantum cosmology , the big - bang singularity could be resolved _ without _ having to introduce external boundary conditions at the big - bang , or matter / clocks with unphysical properties @xcite . in the homogeneous ,",
    "isotropic mini - superspace coupled to a massless scalar field , in particular , an exhaustive analysis can be carried out @xcite . at the analytic level",
    ", one can introduce an appropriate inner product on physical states , define dirac observables and , using the two , construct semi - classical states .",
    "one can then use numerical methods to examine the nature of the quantum space - time .",
    "if one begins with a semi - classical state at large late times ( ` now ' ) and evolves it back in time , it remains semi - classical till one encounters the deep planck regime near the classical singularity . in this regime",
    "the quantum geometry effects dominate .",
    "however , the state becomes semi - classical again on the other side ; the deep planck region serves as a quantum bridge between two large , classical space - times .",
    "the model is too simple to be applied reliably to the actual universe we live in .",
    "however at a conceptual and mathematical level it demonstrates the new possibilities , systematically made available by quantum geometry .",
    "it is then natural to ask if a similar resolution of singularities occurs also in the context of black holes .",
    "now , there is an extensive literature on the nature of black hole singularities in the classical theory .",
    "in particular , detailed mathematical analysis of spherical collapse of uncharged matter was carried out by christodoulou , dafermos and others .",
    "it has led to the expectation that , for black holes formed through gravitational collapse , the singularity would be generically space - like ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , it is natural to focus on this case first and ask for the nature of quantum space - time that would result via their resolution .",
    "if the singularity is resolved and if the quantum geometry in the deep planck regime again serves as a bridge to a large classical region beyond , there would be no information loss in the black hole formation and evaporation process @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "pure states in the distant past would evolve to pure states in the distant future and one would have a space - time description of the entire process in a quantum mechanical setting .",
    "thus , a detailed analysis of the fate of black hole singularities is of considerable importance also for the fundamental issue of whether the standard unitary evolution of quantum physics has to be modified in the setting of black holes .",
    "the purpose of this note is to initiate this investigation using quantum geometry , in the setting of connection dynamics .",
    "we will focus just on the mini - superspace that is appropriate for describing the geometry interior to the horizon of a schwarzschild black hole . since this mini - superspace is spatially homogeneous of kantowski - sachs type one can take over the techniques that have been developed in the setting of homogeneous cosmologies @xcite .",
    "our main result is that the quantum scalar constraint is indeed such that the singularity is resolved .",
    "the salient features of our analysis are as follows .",
    "first , we use a _ self - adjoint _",
    "hamiltonian constraint .",
    "therefore , our analysis can serve as the point of departure for the construction of the physical hilbert space either via the group averaging procedure @xcite _ or _ via deparametrization of the theory as in @xcite .",
    "second , we spell out the symmetry reduction procedure that leads to the kantowski - sachs mini - superspace _ within connection dynamics_. we will see in sections [ s3 ] and [ s4 ] that the structure of the resulting phase space is important to the issue of singularity resolution .",
    "not at @xmath0 as assumed there . therefore , neither is the inverse volume operator ( 17 ) of @xcite bounded or well - defined at the singularity nor does the discrete equation ( 23 ) of @xcite enable one to evolve across the singularity . ] in particular , this space is an extension of the phase space used in geometrodynamics in that one allows for degenerate triads ( and hence 3-metrics ) .",
    "thanks to this enlargement , points of the reduced phase space corresponding to the singularity do not constitute a boundary , whence the support of the wave function ` beyond singularity ' can be interpreted geometrically .",
    "however , we emphasize that the results of this note constitute only initial steps for a more complete theory , e.g. , along the lines of @xcite .",
    "our discussion is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we discuss the classical theory of the kantowski - sachs mini - superspace using connection - dynamics . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we analyze the kinematics of its quantum theory and in section [ s4 ] we present quantum dynamics .",
    "section [ s5 ] provides a brief summary and directions for future work .",
    "this section is divided into two parts . in the first , we carry out the kantowski - sachs symmetry reduction of vacuum general relativity and in the second we discuss the structure of the resulting phase space .",
    "the portion of the space - time interior to the horizon of a schwarzschild black hole can be naturally foliated by 3-manifolds @xmath1 with topology @xmath2 such that the geometry on each slice is invariant under the kantowski  sachs symmetry group @xmath3 . in the discussion of this model",
    "we closely follow @xcite where the mathematical structure of the simpler , isotropic model is studied in detail .    as in any homogeneous situation",
    ", @xmath1 acquires an equivalence class of positive definite metrics related by an overall constant .",
    "we fix one such metric @xmath4 as well as an orthonormal triad @xmath5 and co - triad @xmath6 , compatible with it . with the given symmetry ,",
    "we choose the metric on the orbits of the @xmath7 action to be the unit 2-sphere metric , @xmath8 in polar coordinates @xmath9 .",
    "locally , the corresponding co - triad elements @xmath10 , and @xmath11 can be completed to an orthonormal co - triad by a third form @xmath12 . thanks to the maurer  cartan relations for the symmetry group , @xmath12 must be closed and therefore exact on the given topology , whence it defines a third adapted coordinate @xmath13 via @xmath14 . in these",
    "coordinates the background metric has line element @xmath15 and determinant @xmath16 .    in connection dynamics , the canonically conjugate pair consists of fields @xmath17 of an @xmath18 connection 1-form @xmath19 and a ( possibly degenerate ) triad @xmath20 of density weight 1 on @xmath1 .",
    "this pair is invariant under the symmetry group if it satisfies : _ a = d _ e = [ e , ] [ sym ] for any symmetry vector field @xmath21 and some generator @xmath22 of local , @xmath18 gauge transformations ( which may depend on @xmath21 ) .",
    "one can verify that any such symmetric pair is gauge equivalent to fields of the form : ) ; see , e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "each value of this charge gives rise to an independent sector of invariant connections .",
    "however , only the sector used here allows non - degenerate triads invariant under ( [ sym ] ) with _ the same _ local gauge transformation in @xmath23 and @xmath24 . that @xmath23 in ( [ sym1 ] ) satisfies ( [ sym ] ) can be verified as follows .",
    "if we denote the three generators of the @xmath7 action on @xmath1 by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , and the generator of the @xmath28-action by @xmath29 , then @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "however , this does not exhaust the freedom to perform local @xmath18 gauge transformations entirely : there is still the freedom to perform a _ global _ @xmath39 transformation along @xmath40 which rotates the ` vectors ' @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we will return to this freedom in the next sub - section .    from the invariant triad density ( [ sym2 ] ) we can derive the corresponding co - triad @xmath43 : [ cotriad ] = _ c _ 3 dx + ( _ a_1 + _",
    "b_2 ) d+ ( -_b _ 1 + _ a _ 2 ) dwhere _ c = ; _ b = ; _ a = .",
    "the co - triad in turn determines its spin - connection , the @xmath44-valued 1-form @xmath45 .",
    "as one might expect from the structure of the triad , @xmath45 turns out to be the standard ` magnetic monopole ' connection : @xmath46 consequently , the @xmath37-valued extrinsic curvature 1-form @xmath47 is given by : @xmath48 finally the curvature @xmath49 of @xmath50 can be easily computed .",
    "its dual , the @xmath37-valued vector density @xmath51 has the same invariant form as @xmath52 : @xmath53 these expressions will be used in sections [ s3 ] and [ s4 ] .      the symmetry reduction procedure led us to a 6-dimensional reduced phase space @xmath54 with coordinates @xmath55 .",
    "let us begin by computing the symplectic structure @xmath56 on it .",
    "the basic idea , as in all symmetry reductions , is to pull - back the symplectic structure of the full theory to the symmetry reduced phase space .",
    "however , since the full symplectic structure involves an integral over @xmath1 and since the fields of interest are homogeneous also in the non - compact @xmath57-direction , as usual , we are led to consider only a finite interval @xmath58 in the @xmath57 direction .",
    "let the length of this interval ( w.r.t . the fiducial metric @xmath4 ) be @xmath59 .",

    "however , because of the residual , global @xmath18 gauge freedom mentioned in section [ s2.1 ] , the gauss constraint is not . inserting the invariant connection and triad into the gauss constraint",
    "we obtain @xmath65 which generates simultaneous rotations of the pairs @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "one can either retain this freedom and ensure that all the final constructions are invariant with respect to this ` @xmath77-reflection ' _ or _ eliminate it by a gauge choice such as @xmath79 .",
    "this gauge choice turns out to be particularly convenient for classical dynamics . in the quantum theory , on the other hand",
    ", it is more natural to retain the freedom at first and then ask that physical states be invariant under the parity operator @xmath80 implementing this transformation .",
    "therefore , we will allow both possibilities . in either case",
    "the 4-dimensional phase space carries a global chart @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 if the ` @xmath77-parity gauge ' is fixed . )",
    "these coordinates are subject to the scalar or the hamiltonian constraint , discussed below .",
    "we first note that these variables and , because of its explicit dependence on @xmath59 , the symplectic structure @xmath83 depend on the fiducial metric .",

    "projections to the @xmath114 plane of typical trajectories are shown in figure [ traj2 ] .",
    "it is clear from the figure that @xmath115 can be taken to be the ` internal time parameter ' . in section [ s4.1 ]",

    "each trajectory reaches the maximum value @xmath117 of @xmath78 and meets the @xmath99 axis only at the point where @xmath78 also vanishes ( i.e. , at the ` origin ' ) .",

    "this discrepancy can be traced back to the standard tension between the hamiltonian and space - time notions of gauge ( for a detailed discussion in the context of bianchi models , see @xcite , and in spherically symmetric models , @xcite ) . in the hamiltonian description , rescalings of @xmath120",
    "do not correspond to gauge because they are not generated by any constraint . in the space - time description , on the other hand , they can be absorbed by a rescaling of the coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , to make contact with the space - time description , let us fix @xmath121 .",
    "then , the above solution to the evolution equations defines a 1-parameter family of 3-metrics : q_ab(t ) = ( -1 ) _ a x _ b x + t^2 ( _ a_b + ^2_a _ b ) defining precisely the schwarzschild solution of mass @xmath117 , interior to the horizon",
    ". it will be useful to note that , in this solution @xmath122 , @xmath123 at the horizon ( @xmath124 ) and @xmath99 and @xmath125 diverge at the singularity .",
    "we will see in the next section that it is convenient to regard the space @xmath126 spanned by @xmath78 and @xmath115 as the mini - superspace on which quantum wave functions are defined .",
    "( in that discussion , we will not fix the ` @xmath77-parity gauge ' ; so @xmath115 _ and _ @xmath78 take values on the entire real line . )",
    "let us therefore interpret various regions in @xmath126 .",
    "the triad is non - degenerate everywhere except when @xmath123 or @xmath99 .",
    "however , the two degeneracies are of very different geometric and physical origin .",
    "geometrically ( i.e. , independent of classical dynamics ) @xmath127 separates two regions with triads of opposite orientations , given by @xmath128 . on the other hand , as ( [ cotriad ] ) ( together with our gauge choice which ensures @xmath129 ) shows , the orientation would not have changed even if we had extended @xmath126 across @xmath123 , allowing for negative values for @xmath78 .",
    "more importantly , while the co - triad ( [ cotriad ] ) remains smooth and only becomes degenerate along @xmath123 , it diverges along @xmath99 , signaling the classical singularity .",
    "this suggests that the line @xmath130 corresponds to the horizon and @xmath99 to the singularity .",
    "this is confirmed from physical considerations involving classical dynamics .",
    "classical solutions can be smoothly extended to the line @xmath123 which is reached for @xmath124 .",
    "the curvature @xmath131 remains well - defined there ( see ( [ b ] ) ) .",
    "the other line , @xmath127 , is very different .",
    "along classical solutions , the line @xmath127 is approached as @xmath132 , whence the components ( and invariants ) of curvature @xmath131 also diverge .",
    "this line corresponds to the singularity and can not be crossed by any classical dynamical trajectory .",
    "finally , note that since the line @xmath127 separates the two regions of @xmath126 , where only the triad orientation is reversed , the two get identified in geometrodynamics .",
    "therefore the singularity would lie at a boundary of the mini - superspace in geometrodynamics , making the geometrical meaning of ` evolution across the singularity ' obscure .",
    "furthermore , since the arnowitt  deser  misner ( adm ) variables are based on covariant metrics ( rather than contravariant triad densities ) , as in other homogeneous models @xcite , one of the adm variables becomes _ infinite _ at the classical singularity .",
    "this further complicates a discussion of the singularity structure and its resolution .",
    "this section is divided into two parts . in the first we introduce the basic quantization procedure and in the second we discuss quantum geometry with emphasis on the classical singularity .      as in the isotropic model @xcite",
    ", we will follow the general procedure used in the full theory @xcite . thus the elementary configuration variables will be given by holonomies along curves in @xmath1 and the momenta by fluxes of triads along 2-surfaces in @xmath1 . however , because of symmetry reduction , one need not consider all ( piecewise analytic ) curves or surfaces ; a judiciously chosen , smaller subset suffices to obtain a set of functions that is sufficiently large to separate points of the reduced phase space .",
    "let us begin with the holonomies .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to three sets of curves : those along the @xmath28 direction of @xmath1 with oriented length @xmath133 ; those along the equator of @xmath63 with oriented length @xmath134 ; and those along the longitudes of @xmath63 also with oriented length @xmath134 , where all lengths and orientations are defined using the fiducial triad .",
    "( thus @xmath135 are positive if the tangent to the respective curves are parallel to the triad vectors and negative if they are anti - parallel . )",
    "holonomies along these curves suffice to completely determine any invariant connection ( [ sym1 ] ) . since it is related to @xmath136 by conjugation with @xmath137 .",
    "however , we will use a more ` democratic ' approach which is applicable also when @xmath138 is not made to vanish by gauge fixing . ]",
    "@xmath139 matrix elements of these holonomies are functions of the reduced connection and constitute our configuration variables .",
    "elements of the algebra they generate are almost periodic functions of @xmath77 and @xmath140 of the form @xmath141 , where @xmath142 , @xmath143 and the sum extends over a finite set .",

    "can quantum geometry effects make a qualitative difference as they do in the isotropic model ?",

    "an examination of ( [ qee3mu0 ] ) and ( [ qee3mu1 ] ) reveals that it is in fact sufficient to specify the wave function @xmath246 just at @xmath176 and @xmath252 at each ` time - step ' .",
    "this is a mathematically viable choice of the boundary condition and heuristically it corresponds to providing data the ` horizon ' .",
    "it will turn out that the issue of the resolution of singularity is insensitive to the precise choice of the boundary condition .",
    "we will therefore postpone the discussion of physically appropriate choices until after the main discussion .",
    "let us then start at some finite positive @xmath157 and carry out a backward evolution using ( [ qee2 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ wdw ] ) , the coefficients in the difference equation ( [ qee2 ] ) are always regular . at first one might think that this regularity by itself would be sufficient to ensure that the evolution would be well - defined across the singularity .",

    ", the classical black hole singularity can be traversed using quantum evolution and thus ceases to be a boundary of space - time .",
    "next , recall from section [ s4.1 ] that we could have begun with the expression ( [ hami ] ) of the hamiltonian constraint in the classical theory and then proceeded with quantization . what would be the status of the singularity resolution with this choice ?",
    "the procedure to construct the quantum hamiltonian constraint would be identical .",
    "however , the final result would be slightly different : @xmath298 in ( [ qee2 ] ) would be replaced by @xmath299 .",

    "since the coefficient of @xmath302 is unaltered , one would again be able to ` evolve ' across the singularity .",
    "thus , the conclusion is robust within quantum geometry . to conclude",

    "it would be questionable to use pre - classicality in the @xmath134-direction even if a pre - classical solution exist ( which is not guaranteed , see e.g.the analysis in @xcite ) .",

    "the condition ( [ qee3mu0 ] ) evaluated at @xmath311 gives instead a condition for previous values of the wave function , translating into one condition for the initial values . at @xmath177",

    "there is thus no reduction in conditions on the wave function from the fact that @xmath310 drops out of ( [ qee3mu0 ] ) ; a condition is simply transferred from boundary values to initial values .",
    "note however that , even though the line @xmath177 ( corresponding to the classical singularity ) does show special behavior , evolution does not break down there ; it is only the boundary value problem which changes character .",
    "while such a boundary value problem is mathematically well - defined , the resulting theory is not necessarily physically correct . for , in a physically interesting theory one would expect that , well away from the singularity",

    "1 it is clear that the semi - classical solution peaked on the trajectory labelled by mass @xmath117 would be sharply peaked at @xmath315 on the line @xmath176 , whence semi - classical states peaked at different classical solutions will have quite different forms near @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , the theory obtained by simply fixing the wave function on ( or near ) @xmath176 is not likely to admit a sufficiently rich semi - classical sector .",
    "indeed , it is not clear that any boundary condition at ( or near ) @xmath176 will be physically viable .",
    "rather , one may have to impose the boundary condition at @xmath316 , e.g. , by requiring that the wave function should vanish there .",

    ", one would expect that these semi - classical states would span a dense subspace in the physical hilbert space .",
    "if so , requiring that the wave functions vanish at @xmath316 would be physically justified .",

    "it suggests that the classical singularity does not represent a final frontier ; the _ physical _ space - time does not end there . in the planck regime , quantum fluctuations do indeed become so strong that the classical description breaks down .",
    "the space - time continuum of classical general relativity is replaced by discrete quantum geometry which remains regular during the transition through what was a classical singularity .",
    "certain similarities between the kantowski - sachs model analyzed here and a cosmological model which has been studied in detail @xcite suggest that there would be a quantum bounce to another large classical region .",
    "if this is borne out by detailed numerical calculations , one would conclude that quantum geometry in the planck regime serves as a bridge between two large classical regions .",
    "space - time may be much larger than general relativity has had us believe .    however , as indicated at the end of section [ s4.2 ] significant numerical work is still needed before one can be certain that this scenario is really borne out in the model . moreover ,",
    "this is a highly simplified model .",
    "it is important to check if the qualitative conclusions remain robust as more and more realistic features are introduced .",
    "first , one should extend the analysis so that the space - time region outside the horizon is also covered .",
    "a second and much more important challenge is incorporation of an infinite number of degrees of freedom by coupling the model , e.g. , to a spherically symmetric scalar field .",
    "first steps along these lines have been taken @xcite and one can see that the evolution still extends beyond the classical singularity @xcite .",
    "but a comprehensive treatment still remains a distant goal .",
