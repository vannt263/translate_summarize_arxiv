    "the assumption that the turbulent stress is proportional to pressure in accretion disks ( the @xmath0-model ) is a fundamental ingredient of classic accretion disk theory ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "it has been partially justified by successful application to quasi - steady systems , such as the thermal spectrum of dwarf novae and x - ray binaries ( e.g.  warner 1995 , gierliski & done 2004 ) ; but when applied to more delicate time - dependent dynamics , such as instabilities , the model has encountered difficulties .",
    "for instance , the modelling of dwarf novae outbursts requires different alphas for the high and low states ( smak 1984 ) .",
    "another example involves radiation - pressure dominated accretion flows which the alpha model predicts are subject to thermal and viscous instability ( shakura & sunyaev 1976 , lightman & eardley 1974 ) .",
    "x - ray observations , however , fail to find variability on the timescales expected ( gierliski & done 2004 ) , with only the exceptional luminous source grs 1915 + 105 and the intermediate black hole hlx-1 exhibiting anything like cyclic behaviour driven by thermal instability ( belloni et al .",
    "1997 , done et al .",
    "2004 , sun et al .",
    "2016 , wu et al .",
    "while it is possible the disks are stabilised by an additional but unknown cooling mechanism , it may be that the heating depends on temperature in a weaker way than the alpha model assumes .",
    "for example , the turbulent stresses may be proportional to gas pressure rather than total pressure , or not on pressure at all ( gierlinski & done 2004 ) .    of course , one can bypass the alpha model ( and its assumptions ) and simulate the mhd turbulence in these disks self - consistently , the turbulence then supplied directly by the magnetorotational instability ( mri , balbus & hawley 1991 ) . and in fact early work indicated that radiation - pressure dominated flows were thermally stable ( hirose et al .",
    "2009 ) , in agreement with most observations .",
    "however , recent local and global simulations _ do _ exhibit thermal runaways ( jiang et al .  2013 , sadowski 2016 , mishra et al .",
    "2016 ) , though these expose additional complications that may suppress instability , such as numerical effects ( especially box size ) and the impact of a mean magnetic flux .",
    "obviously , both observations and simulations indicate that the onset and development of thermal instability is far less straightforward than predicted by the classical laminar theory .",
    "one very clear complication is the fact that the stress - pressure relationship can change , for both numerical and physical reasons , yielding instability or stability depending on conditions in the disk and in the simulation .",
    "a quite separate issue is the assumption that thermal instability can be appropriately defined at all , at least when dealing with quasi - steady turbulent states .",
    "the alpha - theory treats the turbulence as a static eddy viscosity , and hence the equilibrium state as laminar .",
    "however , if the state hosts vigorous fluctuations it may not be well - defined , or even make sense , to add a small linear perturbation on top the stochastic background field and subsequently calculate a growth rate .",
    "one envisages that , at the very least , non - model , non - exponential behaviour ensues .",
    "indeed , jiang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) report delayed runaway and algebraic growth rather than exponential growth in their mhd simulations , while janiuk & mishra ( 2012 ) show via a stochastic 1d model that fluctuations induce random luminosity variations rather than the regular outbursts expected .",
    "it is to this aspect of the problem that this paper is devoted , focussing on the constructive and destructive interference of turbulence on thermal instability .    in order to isolate the essence of the problem we employ an idealised model of mri turbulence and of thermal instability .",
    "unstratified shearing box simulations are performed using the code ramses on a state that is mri turbulent and thermally unstable ( at least according to the laminar alpha theory ) .",
    "note that radiation pressure is omitted and the gas cools due to a simple cooling function .",
    "we find that the turbulent fluctuations induce thermal behaviour substantially different to that expected from laminar theory . in particular , the evolution of the temperature resembles more a biased random walk than an exponential runaway , with a wide range of trajectories possible : the temperature in some simulations departs from the laminar equilibrium relatively rapidly , whereas in others it can ` hang around ' for several thermal times .",
    "this motivates a probabilistic interpretation of instability , and we develop a simple statistical framework based on the model of geometric brownian motion .",
    "a key idea is that of the ` escape time ' @xmath1 ( which replaces the e - folding time ) .",
    "it describes how long it takes for the system to deviate significantly from the equilibrium .",
    "reduced models involving both white noise and the power spectrum of the mri show that the probability distribution of @xmath1 possesses a long tail .",
    "thus there is a reasonable chance in any given simulation that thermal runaway is delayed .",
    "it should be stressed that ultimately realistic models of disks still undergo thermal runaways : turbulent fluctuations can impede instability but it can not destroy it .",
    "the stabilisation witnessed in janiuk & misra ( 2012 ) we attribute to the peculiarities of their stochastic model and a very large noise amplitude .",
    "another feature of our mhd simulations is thermal fragmentation when the cooling rate is too small , and hence the laminar thermal instability timescale too short .",
    "the disk can then break up into hot and cold clouds .",
    "this occurs when the thermal mixing ( by turbulence or radiative diffusion ) is inefficient compared to thermal instability . on a sufficiently long lengthscale",
    "this is always presumably the case , but how this relates to the onset of instability in hot accretion flows is unclear .",
    "estimates of both radiative diffusion and turbulent mixing suitable for the inner regions of x - ray binaries indicate that fragmentation is a marginal possibility .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss a number of issues pertinent to thermal instability , stochastic fluctuations , and the limits of the alpha theory ( not all of which we take up in the paper ) .",
    "the third and fourth sections contain our numerical mhd model and the corresponding results , respectively .",
    "we then explore stochastic models in section 5 and construct a statistical theory to help explain the mhd simulations .",
    "our conclusions are then presented in section 6 .",
    "the exact dependence of the turbulent stress , @xmath2 , on pressure is key to the onset of thermal stability in radiation pressure dominated flows .",
    "the instability occurs when @xmath3 , but does not occur when @xmath4 ( piran 1978 ) . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 denote gas and radiation pressure , respectively . the failure to observe signatures of thermal instability in most x - ray observations",
    "have been attributed to the stress depending on gas pressure alone , or possibly the geometric mean of gas and radiation pressure ( gierlinski & done 2004 ) .",
    "it has also been speculated that only exceptionally luminous flows could lead to a situation where @xmath7 , explaining the outbursts of grs 1915 + 105 ( though what exactly causes this shift in the stress s behaviour is unclear ) ( gierlinski & done 2004 , but see also king and ritter 1998 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the mri have since complicated this picture , as they indeed exhibit instability ( jiang et al .",
    "2013 ) , and we are left with the task of numerically tracing out the non - straightforward behaviour of @xmath2 in different conditions .    while earlier unstratified shearing box simulations without radiation pressure found only a weak dependence of stress on pressure ( sano et al .",
    "2004 ) , recent work has shown that @xmath4 when the following conditions are satisfied : the computational domain is sufficiently large , explicit dissipation is included , and there is no net magnetic field ( ross et al .",
    "2016 , hereafter rlg16 ) .",
    "small boxes restrict the size of the turbulent eddies and prevent them from fully responding to an increase in pressure ( be it gas or radiation ) .",
    "this restriction no doubt played a role in the failure of early radiation - pressure dominated simulations to show thermal instability ( hirose et al .",
    "2009 ) : the radial domain was too small , the eddies unnaturally confined , and as a result the stress unable to respond to changes in the total pressure . when larger radial boxes are used , as in recent work , the instability does in fact materialise ( jiang et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "another numerical effect uncovered by rlg16 was a sensitivity to the grid in simulations with no net magnetic field and no explicit diffusion .",
    "as in isothermal runs ( fromang & papaloizou 2007 ) , the stress is proportional to grid size and this leads to a significantly weaker stress - pressure relationship .",
    "local boxes are not the only domains that exhibit the effect ; recent vertically stratified simulations also show that the stress depends on the grid length ( ryan et al .",
    "the weaker dependence , both from numerical dissipation and from the box size , leads to artificially more stable systems ( as can be shown from dimensional analysis ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary for both of these numerical complications to be considered when simulating thermal instability involving gas pressure .",
    "it is likely that global disk simulations of the mri also suffer from strong numerical effects , though these have yet to be fully explored .",
    "another intriguing result from rlg16 is that the stress - pressure relationship depends on the existence and strength of any imposed magnetic flux .",
    "the stronger a mean toroidal flux , the weaker the relationship .",
    "if this behaviour generalises to other field configurations and to the radiation - dominated regime , then one might speculate that highly magnetised flows are less prone to thermal instability .",
    "indeed global simulations of the mri suggest that strong magnetic fields impede thermal instability ( sadowski 2016 ) , possibly because they weaken the connection between the stress and pressure .",
    "this raises the interesting prospect that to assess susceptibility to thermal instability we must also account for the build up and evacuation of large - scale magnetic flux , in addition to the turbulent dynamics ( e.g.  guilet & ogilvie 2012a , 2012b ) .",
    "the alpha theory is a turbulence closure model , supplying a simple eddy viscosity in place of the complicated and chaotic time - dependent dynamics of the flow . on timescales and lengthscales",
    "much longer than the characteristic scales of the turbulence , this approximation provides an adequate description , but its performance worsens the shorter the scales of interest . since thermal instability can possess growth rates of tens of orbits ( or less ) , then the detailed turbulent dynamics could potentially interfere with its onset .",
    "simulations , as expected , show that on shorter timescales the stress - pressure relationship is more complicated than a mere proportionality .",
    "one interesting feature is a time lag of a few orbits between the stress and pressure .",
    "moreover , it is the pressure that follows the stress on shorter times , rather than the other way around .",
    "and so the dependency is opposite to that assumed by the alpha theory : bursts in stress are followed by jumps in pressure ( hirose et al .",
    "what is happening here is that the bursts in stress drive fluctuations in the heating rate ( once their associated energy has reached the dissipation scale ) and hence cause bursts in pressure a short time later .",
    "the effect of this time delay on a stable thermal equilibrium was first explored by hirose et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who argued that if the direction of causation was from the stress to the pressure then thermal instability may not work .",
    "the argument fails , however , to acknowledge that the stress - pressure dynamics exhibit different timescales , with longer timescales ( @xmath8 orbits ) characterised by a pressure - dependent stress ( as in the classical theory ) , while the short timescales show the lags described above ( latter & papaloizou 2012 , rlg16 ) .",
    "follow up work by lin et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and ciesielki et al .",
    "( 2012 ) present linear instability analyses of an alpha disk model with a time - delayed alpha .",
    "these show that the simulated delay of 1 - 10 orbits is insufficiently long to stabilise a thermally unstable state .",
    "they also reveal potential inconsistencies in such simple models : for example , infinite growth rates are possible for certain time - lags , a physical impossibility .",
    "of course , these models are also incomplete , as they include only the either the short term or long term dependencies , but not both concurrently .",
    "mri turbulence has strong variation over a range of timescales , from tens of orbits to a few shear times ( sano et al .",
    "2004 , lesur & ogilvie 2008 ) . in what sense",
    "does a thermal equilibrium exist in such a system ?",
    "time varying perturbations are constantly emerging which lead to a shifting balance of heating and cooling that the system continually responds to . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume that there is well - defined mean equilibrium , then it is awash in finite amplitude fluctuations . how can one then undertake a linear instability analysis ?",
    "is it meaningful to add a tiny perturbation ontop of a sea of finite amplitude perturbations and check if it grows or not ?",
    "on long length and time scales this might work , but certainly not on shorter scales .    putting aside the difficulty of interpreting linear stability analyses , a stochastic",
    "system exhibits a range of complicated and sometimes unexpected behaviour .",
    "a classic example is the destabilisation of fixed points deemed stable by laminar theory .",
    "originally studied in biological population dynamics ( e.g.  levins 1969 , may 1973 ) , this feature of noisy systems appears in numerous applications , such as atmospheric modelling ( e.g.  de swart & grasman 1987 ) , where the unresolved short time and lengths dynamics are represented by stochastic terms ( see majda et al .  1999 , 2003 ) . on the other hand , the influence of stochasticity on an otherwise _ unstable _",
    "fixed point has been studied in financial mathematics , where geometric brownian motion can be used to model volatile stock prices in a rising market . despite the mean trend of increasing prices",
    ", stochasticity can depress the price of some stock dramatically , if not stabilising the fixed point then delaying a runaway in price for some period of time .",
    "the very last example is perhaps the most relevant for our study of thermal instability , as it possesses the key ingredients of ( a ) an unstable fixed point ( according to a deterministic or ` laminar ' theory ) and ( b ) stochastic fluctuations .",
    "the competition between them gives rise to behaviour one might liken to a biased random walk . in between the kicks delivered by the turbulence , the system drifts according to the deterministic unstable dynamics .",
    "one can then imagine certain limits : when the characteristic frequency of the turbulence is much greater than the thermal instability growth rate then we may expect an unbiased random walk , and the system will only weakly sense the underlying thermal physics . in the opposite limit ,",
    "when the growth rate is much greater than the turbulent frequency , the deterministic laminar dynamics should be reproduced .",
    "it is in the intermediate regime , explored in this paper , that interesting nontrivial behaviour manifests .",
    "there are also other key ratios , such as the size of the kicks relative to the magnitude of the fixed point or the initial condition .",
    "if these are too small , then we return to the laminar case .",
    "but for intermediate values , as exhibited by our mri simulations , system trajectories can deviate markedly from both the laminar behaviour and a simple unbiased random walk .      in the previous subsection we considered only temporal fluctuations on the system variables , implicitly regarding them as ` box averaged ' or mean quantities .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0 model assumes a homogenised temperature over @xmath9 , the disk scale height .",
    "turbulent heating , however , is spatially inhomogeneous with strong dissipation occurring in current and vorticity sheets and minimal dissipation in the surrounding regions .",
    "these spatial fluctuations also complicate the picture of thermal instability , especially when the instability growth rate is large .",
    "some form of thermal mixing is necessary to homogenise the temperature of the fluid .",
    "this can take multiple forms , such as turbulent advection , radiative diffusion , or thermal conduction . when thermal instability is present , the assumption of a uniform temperature is reasonable as long as the instability time scale is longer than the mixing timescale , @xmath10 . for less efficient mixing or stronger instability",
    ", there exists a maximal thermal coupling length scale , @xmath11 .",
    "regions separated by more than this only weakly interact thermally during an efolding time .",
    "this implies that regions of a disk separated by more than @xmath12 can undergo thermal runaways independently , and the disk fragments into cold and hot clouds .",
    "regions of strong kinetic and magnetic dissipation are likely to heat catastrophically , while those with weak dissipation will cool catastrophically .",
    "how relevant this scenario is in realistic disks is unclear , though perhaps marginally possible in x - ray binaries .",
    "it is certainly possible in numerical simulations as we show later .     from rlg16 ( shown in green ) .",

    "we wish to explore the essential features of thermal stability and its onset in mri driven turbulence and so we choose an idealised set - up to isolate it .",

    "the treatment of the two terms on the right hand have been modified : the azimuthal advection of energy is solved with an upwind solver , and the second term involving the maxwell and reynolds stresses is added as a source term .    for the set of simulations shown in this paper , we used a box size of @xmath43 with a resolution of @xmath44 . @xmath45 is a reference scale height which is close to but not exactly the same as the scale height at the start of a simulation .",

    "the viscous timescale is probably longer than a typical @xmath1 , as measured in this paper .",
