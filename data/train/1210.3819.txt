    "interference alignment ( ia ) has been a focus of intense research on gaussian interference channels ( gics ) in the recent years on the account of the capacity of interference channels being unknown in general and the potential of ia to get close to the sum - capacity for a broad class of interference channels as the signal to noise ratio ( @xmath11 ) tends to infinity .",
    "the scaling of the sum - capacity with @xmath12 is known as the sum degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the gic @xcite .",
    "the sum - dof is known to be @xmath13 , with probability @xmath14 , for the k - user gic @xcite when all the nodes are equipped with a single antenna and time - varying channel gains are assumed .",
    "the result was proved by using linear precoding at the transmitters over an arbitrarily large number of symbol extensions and zero forcing at the receivers . in a later work @xcite ,",
    "the sum - dof is shown to be @xmath13 with probability @xmath14 even in the case of constant channel - coefficients ( that are drawn from a continuous distribution ) , i.e. , the channel gains do not vary with time , using a non - linear ia technique .",
    "when all the nodes are equipped with @xmath15 antennas , the sum - dof was shown to be @xmath16 for the @xmath7-user gic @xcite .",
    "this result was proved by linear precoding over the transmit antennas without the use of symbol extensions and holds true even in the case of constant channel coefficients .",
    "later @xcite , with the assumption of constant channel coefficients and using a non - linear ia technique , the sum - dof when @xmath17 was found to be equal to @xmath18 where , @xmath19 denotes the greatest common divisor of @xmath15 and @xmath20 , with @xmath15 being the number of antennas at each transmitter and @xmath20 being the number of receive antennas at each receiver .",
    "all the works cited above assumed full channel state information at all the transmitters ( csit ) and receivers ( csir ) .",
    "the notion of sum - dof involves scaling of sum - rate as @xmath12 at high snr and therefore , gaussian input alphabets or lattice codes are always used in the study of sum - dof .",
    "however , in all practical scenarios finite constellations like @xmath15-qam and @xmath15-psk are used at the inputs . _ with the constraint of finite constellation inputs , it is not known whether ia is optimal in some sense_.    linear precoding for optimizing the mutual information between the input and the output has been studied for the single user mimo channel with finite constellation inputs in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "constellation rotation for optimizing the sum - capacity for siso multiple access channel ( mac ) with finite constellation inputs has been examined in @xcite and linear precoding for weighted sum - rate maximization in mimo mac with finite constellation inputs has been studied in @xcite .",
    "note that linear precoding for the siso mac corresponds to constellation rotation at the transmitter .",
    "recently , there has been some progress on the analysis of finite constellation effects in @xmath21-user siso gic @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "constellation rotation was found to increase the constellation constrained sum - capacity of @xmath21-user siso gaussian strong interference channel @xcite , and in @xcite , a metric to find the optimum angle of rotation was proposed . in this paper , we examine achievable rate - tuples with linear precoding for @xmath0-user mimo gaussian interference channel ( gic ) with finite constellation inputs . specifically , we treat interference as noise , i.e. , each transmitter reveals its codebook only to its intended receiver . the maximum rate achievable under such a circumstance for transmitter-@xmath1 ( tx-@xmath1 ) is given by mutual information between the input generated by tx-@xmath1 and the output at receiver rx-@xmath1 .",
    "the channel conditions and values of snr under which the decoding scheme of treating interference as noise with gaussian alphabet inputs is sum - capacity optimal was found for the @xmath21-user siso gic in @xcite-@xcite , for the @xmath0-user siso gic in @xcite and for the @xmath21-user mimo gic in @xcite,@xcite . for given values of channel gains , with gaussian input alphabets , as the snr tends to infinity , treating interference as noise is not sum - capacity optimal @xcite .    _ with the constraint of finite constellation inputs , it is not clear whether treating interference as noise is optimal in some sense . _ first , we need to define a notion of optimality under the constraint of fixed finite constellation inputs and then analyse decoding and transmit schemes with that notion of optimality .",
    "consider a scenario where each transmitter-@xmath1 ( tx-@xmath1 ) , requires to send @xmath2 independent complex symbols per channel use that take values from fixed finite constellations with uniform distribution , for @xmath3 , to receiver-@xmath1 ( rx-@xmath1 ) . throughout this paper , we assume that none of the direct channel gains are zero . for a @xmath0-user mimo gic with finite constellation inputs , as a measure of optimality of linear precoding in the high snr sense ,",
    "we introduce the notion of _ constellation constrained saturation capacity _ ( ccsc ) which is defined as follows .    the maximum rate achieved by tx-@xmath1 as snr tends to infinity , using any linear precoder , when the interference channel - coefficients are zero is termed as the constellation constrained saturation capacity ( ccsc ) for tx-@xmath1 .    for the ease of exposition , throughout the paper",
    ", we assume that the constellations used for the symbols are all the same at all the transmitters , and is of cardinality @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the ccsc for tx-@xmath1 is given by @xmath22 .",
    "in this paper , with the assumption of constant @xmath0-user mimo gic with full global knowledge of channels gains , and finite constellation inputs , we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on the precoders under which treating interference as noise at rx-@xmath1 will achieve a rate for tx-@xmath1 that tends to ccsc for tx-@xmath1 , for all @xmath1 , as snr tends to infinity .",
    "precoders satisfying these necessary and sufficient conditions exist for all direct and cross channel gains , and are termed as _ ccsc optimal precoders_. hence , in the case of finite constellation inputs with the use of appropriate precoders , the rate tuples obtained by treating interference as noise tend to values that are independent of the channel gains . for a @xmath0-user siso gic ,",
    "this result is in contrast with the gaussian input alphabet case where the rate tuples obtained by treating interference as noise tend to values dictated by the channel gains , as the snr tends to infinity .",
    "interestingly , the precoders that achieve ia , if feasible , are also ccsc optimal precoders .",
    "however , finding precoders that align interference is known to be np - hard @xcite in general whereas , the precoders that satisfy the derived necessary and sufficient conditions are easy to find for any given channel - coefficients . since finite snr is of more practical interest",
    ", we propose a gradient - ascent based algorithm to optimize the precoders for the sum - rate achieved by treating interference as noise .",
    "the contributions of the paper are summarized below .    * for a constant @xmath0-user mimo gic using finite constellation inputs with precoding , a high snr approximation for the rate tuples achieved by treating interference as noise at the receivers is derived ( see theorem [ thm1 ] in section [ sec3 ] ) . based on this approximation , we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which the precoders are ccsc optimal ( see theorem [ thm2 ] section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "these conditions are satisfied with probability @xmath14 when the entries of the precoders are chosen from any continuous distribution .",
    "it is observed that the precoders that achieve ia , if feasible , are ccsc optimal .",
    "+ * for the finite snr case , we propose a gradient - ascent based algorithm to improve the sum - rate achieved by treating interference as noise using finite constellation inputs with precoding .",
    "simulation studies indicate considerable improvement in the ergodic sum - rate with precoders obtained using the proposed algorithm for a @xmath7-user mimo gic with @xmath21 antennas at all the nodes , @xmath8 , for all @xmath1 , and qpsk inputs , at low and moderate snrs over that obtained using the ia solution of @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows .",
