    "the next is a collective process involving many local ( magnetic ) domains in a local region - _ an avalanche_. in magnetic materials , as the external magnetic field @xmath2 is changed continuously , these avalanches lead to the magnetic noise : the barkhausen effect@xcite .",
    "this effect can be picked up as voltage pulses in a coil surrounding the magnet .",
    "the distribution of pulse ( avalanche ) sizes is found  @xcite to follow a power law with a cutoff after a few decades , and was interpreted by some  @xcite to be an example of self - organized criticality ( soc )  @xcite .",
    "( in soc , a system organizes itself into a critical state without the need to tune an external parameter . )",
    "other systems can exhibit avalanches as well .",
    "several examples where disorder may play a part are : superconducting vortex line avalanches  @xcite , resistance avalanches in superconducting films  @xcite , and capillary condensation of helium in nuclepore  @xcite .",
    "the history dependence of the state of the system leads to hysteresis .",
    "experiments with magnetic tapes  @xcite have shown that the shape of the hysteresis curve changes with the annealing temperature .",
    "the hysteresis curve goes from smooth to discontinuous as the annealing temperature is increased .",
    "this transition can be explained in terms of a _ plain old critical point _ with two tunable parameters : the annealing temperature and the external field . at",
    "the critical temperature and field , the correlation length diverges , and the distribution of pulse ( avalanche ) sizes follows a power law .    we have argued earlier  @xcite that the barkhausen noise experiments can be quantitatively explained by a model  @xcite with two tunable parameters ( external field and disorder ) , which exhibits _ universal _ , non - equilibrium collective behavior .",
    "the model is athermal and incorporates collective behavior through nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the role of _ dirt _ or disorder , as we call it , is played by random fields .",
    "this paper presents the results and conclusions of a large scale simulation of that model : the non - equilibrium zero - temperature random field ising model ( rfim ) , with a deterministic dynamics .",
    "the results compare very well to our @xmath0 expansion@xcite , and to experiments in barkhausen noise@xcite .",
    "we should mention that there are other models for avalanches in disordered magnets .",

    "our interpretation of the behavior in dimension two has been substantially altered by further analysis  @xcite .",
    "a full description of the numerical method is available , including sample code and executables on the web  @xcite . for a full discussion of the behavior in mean field theory , and interesting behavior below the critical point in seven and nine dimensions ,",

    "magnetic domains are represented by spins @xmath3 on a hypercubic lattice , which can take two values : @xmath4 .",
    "the spins interact ferromagnetically with their nearest neighbors with a strength @xmath5 , and are exposed to a uniform magnetic field @xmath2 ( which is directed along the spins )",
    ". disorder is simulated by a random field @xmath6 , associated with each site of the lattice , which is given by a gaussian distribution function @xmath7 : @xmath8 of width proportional to @xmath9 , which we call the disorder .",
    "the hamiltonian is then @xmath10 for the analytic calculation , as well as the simulation , we have set the interaction between the spins to be independent of the spins and equal to one for nearest neighbors , @xmath11 , and zero otherwise .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in the results of this paper ; we ve checked that the results near @xmath12 are unchanged when a slab of pre  flipped spins is introduced ( fixed boundary conditions along two sides ) .",
    "the dynamics is deterministic , and is defined such that a spin @xmath3 will flip only when its local effective field @xmath13 : @xmath14 changes sign .",
    "all the spins start pointing down ( @xmath15 for all @xmath16 ) . as the field",
    "is adiabatically increased , a spin will flip .",
    "due to the nearest neighbor interaction , a flipped spin will push a neighbor to flip , which in turn might push another neighbor , and so on , thereby generating an avalanche of spin flips . during each avalanche",
    ", the external field is kept constant . for large disorders ,",
    "the distribution of random fields is wide , and spins will tend to flip independently of each other . only small avalanches will exist , and the magnetization curve will be smooth . on the other hand , a small disorder implies a narrow random field distribution which allows larger avalanches to occur .",
    "as the disorder is lowered , at the disorder @xmath17 and field @xmath18 , an infinite avalanche in the thermodynamic system will occur for the first time , and the magnetization curve will show a discontinuity . near @xmath12 and @xmath19 , we find critical scaling behavior and avalanches of all sizes .",
    "therefore , the system has two tunable parameters : the external field @xmath2 and the disorder @xmath9 .",
    "we found from the mean field calculation  @xcite and the simulation that a discontinuity in the magnetization exists for disorders @xmath20 , at the field @xmath21 , but that only at @xmath22 , do we have critical behavior . for finite size systems of length @xmath23",
    ", the transition occurs at the disorder @xmath24 near which avalanches first begin to span the system in one of the _ d _ dimensions ( spanning avalanches ) .",
    "the effective critical disorder @xmath24 is larger than @xmath12 , and @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",

    "the computer time scales as @xmath28 and the memory required for the simulation scales to one bit per spin ( _ i.e. _ , we do not store the random fields ) .",
    "we use data obtained from the simulation to find and describe the critical transition .",
    "we do so using * scaling collapses * , which we review briefly here .",
    "for example , the magnetization as a function of external field @xmath2 is expected to have the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the critical magnetization ( the magnetization at @xmath19 , for @xmath17 ) , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the reduced disorder and reduced field respectively , @xmath33 is a ( non - universal ) rotation between the experimental control variables @xmath34 and the scaling variables @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is a universal scaling function ( @xmath37 refers to the sign of @xmath38 ) . , which we have found produces better collapses than using @xmath39 .",
    "the latter is more traditional , but the two definitions agree as @xmath40 , and differ by an amount which is irrelevant in a renormalization  group sense .",
    "one method we use to estimate error in our exponents is to compare extrapolations based on the two definitions .",
    "] scaling is expected asymptotically for small @xmath38 and @xmath41  _ i.e. _ , for @xmath2 near @xmath19 and @xmath9 near @xmath12 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath42 gives the scaling for the magnetization at the critical field @xmath19 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "if we plot @xmath44 versus @xmath45 , we should obtain the curve @xmath46 , independently of what disorder @xmath9 we choose ( so long as it is close to @xmath12 ) : different experimental and numerical data sets should collapse onto one universal curve @xmath46 .",
    "( actually , one has two curves @xmath47 depending on whether @xmath48 or @xmath49 . )",
    "we use scaling forms similar to ( [ eq : scaling_1 ] ) to analyze all of our measurements .",
    "one can easily show using the scaling form ( [ eq : scaling_1 ] ) that the magnetization scales with a power law @xmath50 at @xmath12 , and that the jump in the magnetization ( the size of the infinite avalanche ) scales as @xmath51 as one varies the disorder below @xmath12 . thus the critical exponents @xmath42 and @xmath52 give the power laws for the singularities in these measured quantities : indeed , that is how these exponents were originally defined and measured . in our system , we will find that directly measuring power laws is not effective in getting good exponents : the critical regime is so large that we need both to use the general scaling form and to extrapolate to the critical point .",
    "the explanatory power of the theory resides in the fact that the same universal critical exponents @xmath42 and @xmath52 and the same universal function @xmath46 should be obtained by simulations at different values of the disorder , simulations of different hamiltonians , and simulations of real experiments , so long as the systems share certain important features and symmetries ( so long as they lie in the same universality class ) . the underlying explanation for why universality and scaling should occur near the critical point is given by the renormalization group  @xcite . above six dimensions , fluctuations are asymptotically not important , and we can calculate @xmath46 and the values of @xmath42 and @xmath52 from mean field theory ( @xmath53 , @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "below six dimensions , the exponents and scaling curves are non - trivial , and to find them one must rely on either perturbative methods  @xcite , experiments , or numerical methods  @xcite as used here .",

    "the scaling function in the inset of figure  [ fig : aval_3 ] has a peculiar shape : it grows by a factor of ten before cutting off .",
    "the consequence of this bump in the shape is that in the simulations it takes many decades in the size distribution for the slope to converge to the asymptotic power law . this can be seen from the comparison between a straight line fit through the @xmath92 ( billion spin ) simulation in figure  [ fig : aval_3 ] and the asymptotic power law @xmath93 obtained from extrapolating the scaling collapses ( thick dashed straight line in the same figure ) . a similar bump exists in other dimensions and mean field as well .",

    "a similar fit  @xcite to the analytical form of the scaling function above @xmath12 gives @xmath100    it is clear from the figure that the growing bump in the scaling curves as the dimension decreases is a foreshadowing of a zero in the scaling curve in two dimensions : this will be discussed further in reference  @xcite .      the avalanche size distribution can also be measured at a field @xmath2 or in a small range of fields centered around @xmath2 .",

    "the results are not conclusive , as noted both from figure  [ fig : span_aval_345]a and from the value of the spanning avalanche exponent @xmath158 defined below : a value of @xmath159 is consistent with one infinite or spanning avalanche at @xmath12 as @xmath160 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath159 in two dimensions , since spanning avalanches ca nt interpenetrate : it s thus plausible that @xmath161 is near zero in three dimensions because it must vanish one dimension lower .",
    "in percolation , a similar multiplicity of infinite clusters  @xcite as the system size is increased is found for dimensions above six which is the upper critical dimension ( ucd ) .",
    "the ucd is the dimension at and above which the mean field exponents are valid .",
    "below six dimensions , there is only one such infinite cluster in percolation .",
    "the existence of a diverging number of infinite clusters in percolation is associated with the breakdown of the hyperscaling relation above six dimensions . since",
    "a hyperscaling relation is a relation between critical exponents that includes the dimension @xmath128 of the system , it is always only satisfied up to and including the upper critical dimension . in our system , the upper critical dimension is also six , but we find spanning avalanches in dimensions even below that . in a comment by maritan _",
    "et al._@xcite , it was suggested that our system should satisfy the hyperscaling relation @xmath162 found in percolation  @xcite .",
    "but since our system has spanning avalanches below the upper critical dimension , this hyperscaling relation breaks down below six dimensions . due to the existence of many spanning avalanches near @xmath12 , the new `` violation of hyperscaling '' relation for dimensions three and above becomes  @xcite : @xmath163 where @xmath161 is the `` breakdown of hyperscaling '' or spanning avalanches exponent defined below .",
    "one can check that our exponents in @xmath68 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 dimensions and mean field satisfy this equation ( see tables  [ table : exponents ] and  [ table : calculated_exp ] ) .    for the simulation , we define a spanning avalanche to be an avalanche that spans the system in a particular direction .",
    "we average over all the directions to obtain better statistics . depending on the size and dimension of the system and the distance from the critical disorder ,",
    "the number of spanning avalanches for a particular value of disorder @xmath9 is obtained by averaging over as few as @xmath88 to as many as @xmath164 different random field configurations .",
    "we define the exponent @xmath161 such that the number @xmath27 of spanning avalanches , at the critical disorder @xmath12 , increases with the linear system size as : @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "the finite size scaling form@xcite for the number of spanning avalanches close to the critical disorder is : @xmath167 where @xmath148 is the correlation length exponent and @xmath168 is the corresponding scaling function ( @xmath37 indicates the sign of @xmath38 ) .",
    "the collapse is shown in figure  [ fig : span_aval_345]d .",
    "( we show the collapses in @xmath87 dimensions here since the existence of spanning avalanches in @xmath68 dimensions is not conclusive . )",
    "these values are used along with the results from other collapses to obtain table  [ table : exponents ] . in the analysis of the avalanche size distribution , magnetization , and correlation functions for @xmath48 , how close we chose to come to the critical disorder @xmath12 was determined by the spanning avalanches : we include no values @xmath9 below the first value which exhibited a spanning avalanche .      we have mentioned earlier that in the thermodynamic limit , at and below the critical disorder @xmath12 , there is a critical field @xmath155 at which the infinite avalanche occurs .",
    "close to the critical transition , for small @xmath169 , the change in the magnetization due to the infinite avalanche scales as ( equation ( [ eq : scaling_1 ] ) ) : @xmath170 where @xmath171 , while above the transition , there is no infinite avalanche .    in finite size systems ,",
    "the transition is not as sharp : we have spanning avalanches above the critical disorder .",
    "if we measure the change in the magnetization due to all the spanning avalanches as a function of disorder @xmath9 at various system sizes @xmath23 , we expect it will obey finite  size scaling ( as did the number of spanning avalanches ) : @xmath172 where @xmath173 is a universal scaling function .",

    "the value of @xmath42 is calculated from @xmath150 and the knowledge of @xmath148 , and is the value used for collapses of the magnetization curves ( discussed earlier ) .",

    "the curves are normalized by the average avalanche size integrated over all fields @xmath2 : @xmath188 .",
    "the spanning avalanches are not included in the calculation of the moments .",
    "we omit the @xmath189 curve from the collapse ; it does nt collapse with the others well , presumably because of subdominant finite size effects .",
    "the exponents for the third and fourth moment can be calculated from those of the second moment , and we find that they agree with the values obtained from their respective collapses .",
    "the exponents we have measured so far are static scaling exponents : they do not depend on the dynamics of the model .",
    "if we measure the time an avalanche takes to occur , we are making a dynamical measurement .",
    "the time measurement in the numerical simulation is done by increasing the time clock by one for each shell of spins in the avalanche .",
    "that is , we implement time as a synchronous dynamics , where in each time step all unstable spins from the previous step are flipped .",
    "the scaling relation between the time @xmath190 it takes an avalanche to occur and the linear size @xmath129 of the avalanche defines the critical exponent @xmath191  @xcite : @xmath192 the exponent @xmath191 is known as the dynamical critical exponent .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : time_1 ] ) gives the scaling for the time it takes for a spin to `` feel '' the effect of another a distance @xmath129 away .",
    "since the correlation length @xmath129 scales like @xmath193 close to the critical disorder , and the characteristic size @xmath66 as @xmath194 , the time @xmath190 then scales with avalanche size as : @xmath195    in our simulation , we measure the distribution of times for each avalanche size @xmath66 .",
