    "rough set theory was introduced by pawlak @xcite in 1982 .",

    "matroid theory also has been used to study rough set theory in recent years @xcite .",

    "matroids have been applied to a number of fields , such as combinatorial optimization @xcite , algorithm design @xcite , information coding @xcite and so on .",

    "the relation is a lattice . in this paper , a matroidal structure",
    "is constructed by the lattice , and then relationships between the lattice and the closed - set lattice of the matroid are studied .",
    "in fact , the collection of all the regular sets based on a serial and transitive is a semimodular lattice .",
    "we define a family of subsets by the height function of the semimodular lattice , and then prove that this family satisfies the independent set axiom of matroids .",
    "therefore , we obtain a matroid with the family as its independent sets .",
    "the rank function of the matroid is also represented by the height function of the semimodular lattice .",
    "moreover , we propose an approach to obtain all the closed sets of the matroid from the semimodular lattice .",
    "this approach has three steps .",
    "firstly , any singleton which is a subset of the universe but not a subset of any atom of the semimodular lattice is a closed set of the matroid .",

    "thirdly , if there exist two regular sets in the semimodular lattice with the property that one covers the other one and a subset of the universe whose elements are between the two ones of these two regular sets , then the closure of the subset is equal to the regular set whose height function is one more than the remaining one .",
