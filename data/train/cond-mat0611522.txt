    "this algorithm is a variational method within a class of states termed projected entangled  pair states ( peps ) .",
    "it has been proven to work well for the heisenberg antiferromagnet  @xcite and the frustrated shastry - sutherland model  @xcite .",

    "the algorithm is a variational method with respect to the class of peps .",
    "these states have been found to be adequate for representing the ground state of numerous many  body systems . also , these states are favorable to variational calculations because they possess an internal refinement parameter , the virtual dimension  @xmath0 , that allows to control the precision of the calculation .",
    "while @xmath1 specializes the peps to a product state , the choice @xmath2 ( with  @xmath3 being the total number of lattice sites and  @xmath4 the dimension of one subsystem ) enlarges the space of peps to the complete hilbert ",

    "the key element of the algorithm is thus the optimization of the parameters of a peps such that its distance to a given state is minimized .",
    "the manner in which the optimization is performed is closely related to the structure of peps . a peps is a state with coefficients that are contractions of tensors according to a certain scheme .",

    "evolution of a mps  @xcite .",
    "there , each multiplication with a mpo corresponds to one evolution  step .",
    "the problem of the exponential increase of the virtual dimension is circumvented by restricting the evolution to the subspace of mps with a certain virtual dimension  @xmath54 .",
    "this means that after each evolution  step the resulting mps is approximated by the `` nearest '' mps with virtual dimension  @xmath54 .",
    "this approximation can be done efficiently , as shown in  @xcite . in this way , also @xmath23 can be calculated efficiently : first , the mps @xmath55 is formed by multiplying the mps @xmath32 with mpo @xmath34 .",

    "experimentally , the variation of  @xmath85 can be realized by tuning the depth of the optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "the quantity that is typically measured is the momentum distribution .",
    "the is done by letting the atomic gas expand and measuring the density distribution of the expanded cloud .",
    "thus , we will be mainly interested here in the ( quasi)momentum distribution @xmath86 of the particles .    in the following , we focus on the limit of a hard  core interaction , @xmath87 .",
    "in this limit , two particles are prevented from occupying a single site .",
    "this limit is especially interesting in one dimension where the particles form the so  called tonks - girardeau gas  @xcite .",
    "the particles in this gas are strongly correlated  which leads to algebraically decaying correlation functions . in two dimensions ,",
    "the model was studied in detail in  @xcite . in the hard ",

    "this hamiltonian has the structure we can simulate with the algorithm : it describes @xmath93 physical systems of dimension  @xmath94 on a @xmath37square lattice .",
    "the principle of simulating a time  evolution step according to @xmath88hamiltonian is as follows : first , a peps @xmath95 with physical dimension  @xmath94 and virtual dimension  @xmath0 is chosen as a starting state .",
    "this state is evolved by the time ",
    "evolution operator  @xmath96 ( we assume @xmath97 ) to yield another peps @xmath18 with increased virtual dimension  @xmath19 : @xmath98 the virtual dimension of this state is then reduced to  @xmath0 by applying the algorithm of the previous section .",
    "this means , a new peps @xmath15 with virtual dimension  @xmath0 is calculated that has minimal distance to @xmath18 .",
    "this new peps is then the starting state for the next time ",
    "evolution step .",
    "the operator  @xmath79 , however , increases the virtual dimension of a peps by a factor that scales exponentially with  @xmath52 .",
    "this is why it is more convenient to approximate  @xmath79 by an operator that increases the virtual dimension merely by a constant factor  @xmath99 .",
    "this is done by means of a trotter  approximation : first , the interaction  terms are classified in _",
    "horizontal _ and _ vertical _ according to their orientation and in _ even _ and _ odd _ depending on whether the interaction is between even  odd or odd  even rows ( or columns ) .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be decomposed into a _",
    "horizontal  even _ , a _ horizontal  odd _ , a _ vertical  even _ and a _ vertical  odd _ part : @xmath100 the single  particle operators of the hamiltonian can simply be incorporated in one of the four parts . using the trotter ",
    "approximation , the time  evolution operator  @xmath79 can be written as a product of four evolution  operators : @xmath101 since each of the four parts of the hamiltonian consists of a sum of commuting terms , each evolution  operator equals a product of two  particle operators @xmath102 acting on neighboring sites  @xmath6 and  @xmath38 .",
    "these two  particle operators have a schmidt  decomposition consisting of  @xmath5 terms : @xmath103 one such two  particle operator  @xmath104 applied to the peps  @xmath95 modifies the tensors  @xmath105 and  @xmath106 associated with sites  @xmath6 and  @xmath38 as follows : assuming the sites  @xmath6 and  @xmath38 are horizontal neighbors , @xmath105 has to be replaced by @xmath107^k_{l(r\\rho)ud } = \\sum_{k'=1}^2 \\big[u_{i}^{\\rho}\\big]^k_{k ' } \\big[a_i^0\\big]^{k'}_{lrud}\\ ] ] and @xmath106 becomes @xmath108^k_{(l\\rho)rud } = \\sum_{k'=1}^2 \\big[v_{j}^{\\rho}\\big]^k_{k ' } \\big[a_j^0\\big]^{k'}_{lrud}.\\ ] ] these new tensors have a joint index related to the bond between sites  @xmath6 and  @xmath38 .",
    "this joint index is composed of the original index of dimension  @xmath0 and the index  @xmath109 of dimension  @xmath5 that enumerates the terms in the schmidt  decomposition .",
    "thus , the effect of the two  particle operator  @xmath104 is to increase the virtual dimension of the bond between sites  @xmath6 and  @xmath38 by a factor of  @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , @xmath110 and @xmath111 increase the dimension of every second horizontal bond by a factor of  @xmath5 ; @xmath112 and @xmath113 do the same for every second vertical bond . by applying all four evolution ",
    "operators consecutively , we have found an approximate form of the time ",

    "this is why we append some notes about how to make the simulation more efficient : + _ 1.- partitioning of the evolution : _ the number of required numerical operations decreases significantly as one time ",
    "evolution step is partitioned into  @xmath5 substeps : first the state  @xmath95 is evolved by @xmath113 only and the dimension of the increased bonds is reduced back to  @xmath0 .",

    "step decreases by a factor of  @xmath119 . + _",
    "2.- optimization of the contraction order : _ most critical for the efficiency of the numerical simulation is the order in which the contractions are performed .",
    "we have optimized the order in such a way that the scaling of the number of multiplications with the virtual dimension  @xmath0 is minimal . for this",
    ", we assume that the dimension  @xmath54 that tunes the accuracy of the approximate calculation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath120 . the number of required multiplications is then of order  @xmath121 and the required memory scales as  @xmath122 . + _ 3.- optimization of the starting state : _ the number of sweeps required to reach convergence depends on the choice of the starting state for the optimization .",
    "the idea for finding a good starting state is to reduce the bonds with increased virtual dimension  @xmath123 by means of a schmidt  decomposition .",

    "our simulations were run on a workstation with a @xmath163  ghz intel xeon processor .",
    "on such a system , one evolution step on a @xmath143lattice with @xmath118 required a computing time of @xmath164  hours .",
