    "[ [ problem - description ] ] problem description + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    data dimensionality reduction is fundamental for understanding and management of data . in traditional approaches , such as factor analysis ,",
    "a decomposition of an object - variable matrix is sought into an object - factor matrix and a factor - variable matrix with the number of factors reasonably small .",
    "compared to the original variables , the factors are considered more fundamental concepts , which are hidden in the data .",
    "their discovery and interpretation , which is central importance in our paper , helps better understand the data .    in this paper , we consider decompositions of matrices @xmath0 with a particular type of ordinal data .",
    "namely , each entry @xmath1 of @xmath0 represents a grade to which the object corresponding to the @xmath2th row has , or is incident with , the attribute corresponding to the @xmath3th row .",
    "examples of such data are results of questionnaires where respondents ( rows ) rate services , products , etc . , according to various criteria ( columns ) ; results of performance evaluation of people ( rows ) by various tests ( columns ) ; or binary data in which case there are only two grades , @xmath4 ( no , failure ) and @xmath5 ( yes , success ) . our goal is to decompose an @xmath6 object - attribute matrix @xmath0 into a product @xmath7 of an @xmath8 object - factor matrix @xmath9 and a @xmath10 factor - attribute matrix @xmath11 with the number @xmath12 of factors as small as possible .    the scenario is thus similar to ordinary matrix decomposition problems but there are important differences .",
    "first , we assume that the entries of @xmath0 , i.e. the grades , as well as the entries of @xmath9 and @xmath11 are taken from a bounded scale @xmath13 of grades , such as the real unit interval @xmath14 $ ] or the likert scale @xmath15 of degrees of satisfaction .",
    "second , the matrix composition operation @xmath16 used in our decompositions is not the usual matrix product .",
    "instead , we use the t - norm - based product with a t - norm @xmath17 being a function used for aggregation of grades .",
    "in particular , @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 denoted the supremum ( maximum , if @xmath13 is linearly ordered ) .",
    "the ordinary boolean matrix product is a particular case of this product in which the scale @xmath13 has @xmath4 and @xmath5 as the only grades and @xmath21 .",
    "also , when @xmath9 and @xmath11 are thought of as fuzzy relations , @xmath18 is exactly the usual composition of fuzzy relations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is to be emphasized that we attempt to treat graded incidence data in a way which is compatible with its semantics .",
    "this need has been recognized long ago in mathematical psychology , in particular in measurement theory @xcite .",
    "for example , even if we represent the grades by numbers such as @xmath22strongly disagree , @xmath23disagree , ",
    ", @xmath24strongly agree , addition , multiplication by real numbers , and linear combination of graded incidence data may not have natural meaning .",
    "consequently , decomposition of a matrix @xmath0 with grades into the ordinary matrix product of arbitrary real - valued matrices @xmath9 and @xmath11 suffers from a difficulty to interpret @xmath9 and @xmath11 , as well as to interpret the way @xmath0 is reconstructed from , or explained by , @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is not to say that the usual matrix decompositions of incidence data @xmath0 may not be useful .",
    "for example , @xcite report that decompositions of binary matrices into real - valued matrices may yield better reconstruction accuracies .",
    "hence , as far as the dimensionality reduction aspect ( the technical aspect ) is concerned , ordinary decompositions may be favorable .",
    "however , when the knowledge discovery aspect plays a role , attention needs to be paid to the semantics of decomposition .",
    "our algorithm is based on @xcite , in particular on using formal concepts of @xmath0 as factors .",
    "this is important both from the technical viewpoint , since due to @xcite optimal decompositions may be obtained this way , and the knowledge discovery viewpoint , since formal concepts may naturally be interpreted .",
    "[ [ sec : rw ] ] related work + + + + + + + + + + + +    recently , new methods of matrix decomposition and dimensionality reduction have been developed .",
    "one aim is to have methods which are capable of discovering possibly non - linear relationships between the original space and the lower dimensional space @xcite .",
    "another is driven by the need to take into account constraints imposed by the semantics of the data .",
    "examples include nonnegative matrix factorization , in which the matrices are constrained to those with nonnegative entries and which leads to additive parts - based discovery of features in data @xcite .",
    "another example , relevant to this paper , is boolean matrix decomposition",
    ". early work on this problem was done in @xcite which already include complexity results showing the hardness of problems related to boolean matrix decompositions .",
    "recent work on this topic includes @xcite . as was mentioned above",
    ", boolean matrix decomposition is a particular case of the problem considered in this paper .",
    "in particular , the present approach is inspired by @xcite .",
    "note also that partly related to this paper are methods for decomposition of binary matrices into non - binary ones such as @xcite , see also @xcite for further references .",
    "as was mentioned above , we assume that for the problem of finding a decomposition ( [ eqn : iab ] ) of @xmath0 with the matrix product defined by ( [ eqn : dec ] ) , the set @xmath13 of grades forms a bounded scale equipped with an aggregation operation @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , we assume that @xmath13 is a complete lattice bounded by @xmath4 and @xmath5 and that @xmath17 is a binary operation on @xmath13 that is commutative , associative , has @xmath5 as its neutral element , and commutes with suprema , i.e. @xmath25 note that this in particular implies @xmath26 . it is well - known , see e.g. @xcite , that for any such operation , one may define its residuum @xmath27 by @xmath28 the residuum satisfies an important technical condition called adjointness , namely , @xmath29 @xmath13 together with @xmath17 and @xmath30 satisfying the above conditions forms a complete residuated lattice @xcite .    complete residuated lattices are well known in fuzzy logic where are used as the structures of truth degrees with @xmath17 and @xmath27 being the truth functions of ( many - valued ) conjunction and implication .",
    "important examples include those with @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath17 being a continuous t - norm , such as @xmath21 ( gdel t - norm ) , @xmath31 ( goguen t - norm ) , and @xmath32 ( ukasiewicz t - norm ) ; or @xmath13 being a finite chain equipped with the restriction of gdel t - norm , ukasiewicz t - norm , or other suitable operation . since these matters are routinely known , we omit details and refer the reader for further examples and properties of residuated lattices to @xcite .",
    "consider now the meaning of the factor model given by ( [ eqn : iab ] ) and ( [ eqn : dec ] ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath9 and @xmath11 represent relationships between objects and factors , and between factors and the original attributes .",
    "we interpret @xmath33 as the degree to which the factor @xmath34 applies to the object @xmath2 , i.e. the truth degree of the proposition `` factor @xmath34 applies to object @xmath2 '' ; and @xmath35 as the degree to which the attribute @xmath3 is a particular manifestation of the factor @xmath34 , i.e. the truth degree of the proposition `` attribute @xmath3 is a manifestation of factor @xmath34 '' .",
    "therefore , due to basic principles of fuzzy logic , if @xmath36 , the discovered factors explain the original relationship between objects and attributes , represented by @xmath0 , via @xmath9 and @xmath11 as follows : the degree @xmath1 to which the object @xmath2 has the attribute @xmath3 equals the degree of the proposition `` there exists factor @xmath34 such that @xmath34 applies to @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a particular manifestation of @xmath34 '' .",
    "as the nature of the relationship between objects and attributes via factors is traditionally of interest , it is worth noting that in our case , the attributes are expressed by means of factors in a non - linear manner :    [ ex : nonl ] with ukasiewicz t - norm , let @xmath36 be @xmath37 then for @xmath38 and @xmath39 we have @xmath40 .",
    "we now need to recall a result from @xcite saying that optimal decompositions of @xmath0 may be attained by using formal concepts of @xmath0 as factors .",
    "denote by @xmath41 the set of all fuzzy sets in a set @xmath42 with truth degrees from @xmath13 , i.e. the set of all mappings from @xmath42 to @xmath13 , and put @xmath43 ( objects ) and @xmath44 ( attributes ) .",
    "a _ formal concept _ of @xmath0 is any pair @xmath45 of fuzzy sets @xmath46 and @xmath47 for which @xmath48 and @xmath49 where the operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 are defined by @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is the infimum in @xmath13 ( in our case , since @xmath54 and @xmath55 are finite , infimum coincides with minimum if @xmath13 is linearly ordered ) .",
    "the set @xmath56 of all formal concepts of @xmath0 is called the _",
    "concept lattice _ of @xmath0 and forms indeed a complete lattice when equipped with a natural subconcept - superconcept ordering , see @xcite for details .",
    "formal concepts are simple models of concepts in the sense of traditional , port - royal logic .",
    "for a formal concept @xmath45 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are called the extent and the intent of @xmath45 ; the degrees @xmath59 and @xmath60 are interpreted as the degrees to which the concept applies to object @xmath2 and attribute @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the graded setting takes into account that most concepts used by humans are graded rather than clear - cut .    for a set @xmath61 of formal concepts of @xmath0 with a fixed order given by the indices ,",
    "denote by @xmath62 and @xmath63 the @xmath8 and @xmath10 matrices defined by @xmath64 that is , the @xmath34th column of @xmath62 consists of grades assigned to the objects by @xmath65 and the @xmath34th row of @xmath63 consists of grades assigned to attributes by @xmath66 .    if @xmath67 , @xmath68 can be seen as a set of factors which fully explain the data .",
    "in such a case , we call the formal concepts from @xmath68 _ factor concepts_. in this case , the factors have a natural , easy - to - understand meaning as is demonstrated in section [ sec : ie ] .",
    "let @xmath69 denote the schein rank of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath70 the following theorem was proven in @xcite .",
    "[ thm : fcaof ] for every @xmath6 matrix @xmath0 with entries from @xmath13 there exists a set @xmath71 containing exactly @xmath69 formal concepts for which @xmath72    the theorem says that , in a sense , formal concepts of @xmath0 are optimal factors for decompositions .",
    "it follows that when looking for decompositions of @xmath0 , one can restrict the search to the set of formal concepts instead of the set of all possible decompositions .",
    "to prevent misunderstanding , let us define our problem precisely . for a given ( that is , constant for the problem ) structure of truth degrees ,",
    "i.e. set @xmath13 equipped with the lattice operations and @xmath17 and @xmath27 , the problem we discuss is a minimization ( optimization ) problem @xcite specified as follows :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     a similar tendency can also be observed for graded incidence data .",
    "for instance , we have utilized the algorithm in factor analysis of the forest fires  @xcite dataset from the uci machine learning repository . in its original form ,",
    "the dataset contains real values .",
    "it has been therefore transformed into a graded incidence matrix representing relationship between spatial coordinates within the montesinho park map ( rows ) and 50 different groups of environmental and climate conditions ( columns ) .",
    "the matrix entries are degrees ( coming from an equidistant ukasiewicz chain @xmath73 ) to which there has been a large area of burnt forest in the sector of the map under the environmental conditions . factor analysis of data in this form can help reveal factors which contribute to forests burns in the park . the exact factorization has revealed 46 factors which explain 50 attributes . as in case of the boolean datasets , relatively small number of factors explain large portions of the data . for instance , more than @xmath74 of the data is covered by @xmath75 factors , more than @xmath76 of the data is covered by @xmath77 factors , see  fig.[fig : forest ] .",
    "we presented a novel approach to decomposition and factor analysis of matrices with grades , i.e. of a particular form of ordinal data .",
    "the factors in this approach correspond to formal concepts in the data matrix .",
    "the approach is justified by a theorem according to which optimal decompositions are attained by using formal concepts as factors .",
    "the relationship between the factors and original attributes is a non - linear one .",
    "an advantageous feature of the model is a transparent way of treating the grades which results in good interpretability of factors .",
    "we observed that the decomposition problem is np - hard as an optimization problem .",
    "we proposed a greedy algorithm for computing suboptimal decompositions and provided results of experiments demonstrating its behavior .",
    "furthermore , we presented a detailed example of factor discovery which demonstrates that the method yields interesting factors from data .",
    "since the method developed naturally allows for a linguistic interpretation of factors , it may be considered as a step toward what might be regarded a linguistic factor analysis of qualitative data .",
    "future research will include the following topics .",
    "first , a comparison , both theoretical and experimental , to other methods of matrix decompositions , in particular to the methods emphasizing good interpretability , such as non - negative matrix factorization @xcite .",
    "second , an investigation of approximate decompositions of @xmath0 , i.e. decompositions to @xmath9 and @xmath11 for which @xmath18 is approximately equal to @xmath0 with respect to a reasonable notion of approximate equality .",
    "third , development of further theoretical insight focusing particularly on reducing further the space of factors to which the search for factors can be restricted .",
    "fourth , study the computational complexity aspects of the problem of approximate factorization , in particular the approximability of the problem of finding decompositions of matrix @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "fifth , explore further the applications of the decompositions studied in this paper , particularly in areas such as psychology , sports data , or customer surveys , where ordinal data is abundant .",
