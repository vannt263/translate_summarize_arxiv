    "in his seminal work , wyner introduced the wiretap channel @xcite , a discrete memoryless channel where the sender alice transmits confidential messages to a legitimate receiver bob , in the presence of an eavesdropper eve , who has only partial access to what bob sees .",
    "both reliable and confidential communication between alice and bob is shown to be achievable at the same time , by exploiting the physical difference between the channel to bob and that to eve , without the use of cryptographic means . since then",
    ", many results of information theoretical nature have been found for various classes of wiretap channels ranging from gaussian point - to - point channels to relay networks ( see e.g. @xcite for a survey ) capturing the trade - off between reliability and secrecy and aiming at determining the highest information rate that can be achieved with perfect secrecy , the so - called _ secrecy",
    "capacity_. coding results focusing on constructing concrete codes that can be implemented in a specific channel are much fewer ( see @xcite for wiretap codes dealing with channels with erasures , @xcite for polar wiretap codes and @xcite for wiretap rayleigh fading channels .    in this paper , we will focus on gaussian wiretap channels , whose secrecy capacity was established in @xcite .",
    "examples of existing gaussian wiretap codes were designed for binary inputs , as in @xcite .",
    "a different approach was adopted in @xcite , where lattice codes were proposed , using as design criterion a new lattice invariant called _ secrecy gain _ , defined as the maximum of its _ secrecy function _",
    "( section ii ) , which was shown to characterize the confusion at the eavesdropper .",
    "a recent study on a new design criterion called _ flatness factor _ confirms that to confuse eve , the secrecy gain should be maximized @xcite .",
    "this suggests the study of the secrecy gain of lattices as a way to understand how to design a good gaussian lattice wiretap code .",
    "belfiore and sol @xcite discovered a symmetry point , called _ weak secrecy gain _ , in the secrecy function of _ unimodular _ lattices ( generalized to all _ @xmath3-modular _ lattices @xcite ) and conjectured that the weak secrecy gain is actually the secrecy gain .",
    "anne - maria ernvall - hytnen @xcite invented a method to prove or disprove the conjecture for unimodular lattices .",
    "up to date , secrecy gains of a special class of unimodular lattices called _ extremal unimodular _ lattices and all unimodular lattices in dimensions up to @xmath4 are computed @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the average weak secrecy gain as a function of the dimension @xmath5 was investigated and an achievable lower bound on the secrecy gain of even unimodular lattices was given @xcite .",
    "numerical upper bounds on the secrecy gains of unimodular lattices in general and unimodular lattices constructed from self - dual binary codes were given to compared with the achievable lower bound @xcite .",
    "this paper studies the weak secrecy gain of @xmath0- and @xmath1-modular lattices .",
    "preliminary work @xcite showed that most of the known even @xmath0- and @xmath1-modular lattices in dimensions up to @xmath6 have secrecy gains bigger than the best unimodular lattices .",
    "after recalling how to compute the weak secrecy gain of even @xmath0- and @xmath1-modular lattices using the theory of modular forms , we extend our study to a class of odd @xmath0-modular lattices constructed from self - dual codes .",
    "we propose two methods to compute their weak secrecy gains and find three of these lattices have secrecy gains bigger than the best unimodular lattices .",
    "we then conclude that , at least in dimensions up to @xmath4 , @xmath0- and @xmath1-modular lattices are a better option than unimodular lattices .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] , we first give a brief introduction to modular lattices and their _ theta series _ as well as recall the definition of the secrecy gain and the previous results concerning this lattice invariant .",
    "the main results are given in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "two approaches to compute the theta series of modular lattices are given , one making use of the modular form theory while the other utilizing the connection between the theta series and the weight enumerator of self - dual codes .",
    "weak secrecy gains of several @xmath0- and @xmath1-modular lattices computed are then compared with the best unimodular lattices in section [ sec : comparision ] . in section [ sec : conclu ] , we summarize our results and give some future works .",
    "consider a gaussian wiretap channel , which is modeled as follows : alice wants to send data to bob over a gaussian channel whose noise variance is given by @xmath7 .",
    "eve is the eavesdropper trying to intercept data through another gaussian channel with noise variance @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , in order to have a positive secrecy capacity @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the model is @xmath10 @xmath11 is the transmitted signal . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the received signals at bob s , respectively eve s side . @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the gaussian noise vectors at bob s , respectively eve s side , each component of both vectors are with zero mean , and respective variance @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this paper , we choose @xmath16 to be a codeword coming from a specially designed lattice of dimension @xmath5 , namely , we consider lattice coding .",
    "let us thus start by recalling some concepts concerning lattices , in particular , _",
    "modular lattices_.    a _ lattice _",
    "@xmath17 is an additive subgroup of @xmath18 , which can be described in terms of its _ generator matrix _",

    "the matrix @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the transpose of @xmath19 , is called the _ gram matrix _ of the lattice .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath25th entry of @xmath26 is the inner product of the @xmath27th and @xmath28th row vectors of @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath29 the _ determinant _ @xmath30 of a lattice @xmath17 is the determinant of the matrix @xmath26 , which is independent of the choice of the matrix @xmath19 .",
    "a _ fundamental region _ for a lattice is a building block which when repeated many times fills the whole space with just one lattice point in each copy .",
    "there are many different ways of choosing a fundamental region for a lattice @xmath17 , but the volume of the fundamental region is uniquely determined and called the _ volume _",
    "@xmath31 of @xmath17 , which is exactly @xmath32 .",
    "let us see an example of a fundamental region of a lattice .",
    "a _ voronoi cell _ @xmath33 of a lattice point @xmath16 in @xmath17 consists of the points in the space that are closer to @xmath16 than to any other lattice points of @xmath17 .",
    "the _ dual _ of a lattice @xmath17 of dimension @xmath5 is defined to be @xmath34 a lattice @xmath17 is called an _ integral lattice _ if @xmath35 .",
    "the norm of any lattice point in an integral lattice @xmath17 is always an integer .",
    "if the norm is even for any lattice point , then @xmath17 is called an _ even _ lattice .",
    "otherwise , it is called an _ odd",
    "_ lattice .",
    "a lattice is said to be _ equivalent _ , or geometrically similar to its dual , if it differs from its dual only by possibly a rotation , reflection and change of scale .",
    "an integral lattice that is equivalent to its dual is called a _ modular _ lattice .",
    "alternatively as it was first defined by h .-",
    "quebbemann @xcite , an @xmath5-dimensional integral lattice @xmath17 is modular if there exists a similarity @xmath36 of @xmath18 such that @xmath37 .",

    "the theta series of a lattice @xmath17 is defined by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is called the ( squared ) norm of @xmath66 and @xmath67 denotes the upper half plane .",
    "the theta series of an integral lattice has a neat representation .",
    "since the norms are all integers , we can combine the terms with the same norm and write @xmath68 where @xmath69 counts the number of lattice points with norm @xmath70 .",
    "they are actually _ modular forms _ @xcite .",
    "we will also need the following functions and formulae from analytic number theory for our discussion , for which interested readers can refer to @xcite .",
    "the jacobi theta functions are defined as follows : @xmath71    the dedekind eta function is defined by @xmath72    the jacobi theta functions and the dedekind eta function are connected as follows @xcite : @xmath73    lattice encoding for the wiretap channel ( [ channel model ] ) is done via a generic coset coding strategy @xcite : let @xmath74 be two nested lattices .",
    "a @xmath57-bit message is mapped to a coset in @xmath75 , after which a vector is randomly chosen from the coset as the encoded word .",
    "the lattice @xmath76 can be interpreted as introducing confusion for eve , while @xmath77 is intended to ensure reliability for bob .",
    "since a message is now corresponding to a coset of codewords instead of one single codeword , the probability of correct decoding is then summing over the whole coset ( suppose that we do not have power constraint and are utilizing the whole lattice to do the encoding ) .",
    "here we are interested in computing @xmath78 , eve s probability of correct decision , and want to minimize this probability .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that to minimize @xmath78 is to minimize @xmath79 which is easily recognized as the theta series of @xmath76 at @xmath80 .",
    "we hence only care about values of @xmath81 such that @xmath82 .",
    "motivated by the above argument , the confusion brought by the lattice @xmath76 with respect to no coding ( namely , use a scaled version of the lattice @xmath83 with the same volume ) is measured as follows :    @xcite let @xmath17 be an @xmath5-dimensional lattice of volume @xmath84 .",
    "the secrecy function of @xmath17 is given by @xmath85 the _ secrecy gain _ is then the maximal value of the secrecy function with respect to @xmath81 and is denoted by @xmath86 .",

    "this paper is devoted to computing the weak secrecy gain of @xmath0- and @xmath1-modular lattices in small dimensions .",
    "the key to the computation of secrecy gains is the theta series of the corresponding lattice .",
    "we present here two approaches to obtain a closed form expression of the theta series of @xmath0- and @xmath1-modular lattices : the modular form approach and the weight enumerator approach .",
    "the modular form approach relies on the fact that the theta series of an @xmath3-modular lattice belongs to the space of modular forms generated by some basic functions , which gives a decomposition formula .",
    "the formula for even @xmath0- and @xmath1-modular lattices is comparatively simple while the formula for @xmath3-modular lattices in general , including the odd lattices , is rather complicated .",
    "a weight enumerator approach is added in the computation for odd @xmath0-modular lattices in the second subsection .",
    "this approach exploits the connection between the weight enumerator of a self - dual code and the theta series of a lattice constructed from this code . but",
    "calculating the weight enumerator of the code adds considerable workload .",
    "the theta series of modular lattices are modular forms , which , roughly speaking , are functions that stay `` invariant '' under the transformation by certain subgroups of the group sl@xmath93 @xcite .",
    "the modular form theory shows that theta series as modular forms are expressed in a polynomial in two basic modular forms .",
    "we only need a few terms of a theta series to compute the coefficients of this expression and obtain a closed form expression of the theta series .",
    "the following lemma plays a crucial role in our calculation of the theta series of @xmath0- and @xmath1-modular lattices .",
    "@xcite[lemma ] the theta series of an even @xmath3-modular lattice of dimension @xmath94 when @xmath95 belongs to a space of _ modular forms _ of weight @xmath57 generated by the functions @xmath96 with integers @xmath97 satisfying @xmath98 , where for @xmath95 , @xmath99 respectively , @xmath100 , @xmath101 denote the theta series of the modular lattices @xmath102 , respectively , and @xmath103 .",

    ", we need to have the theta series of @xmath83 scaled to the right volume .",
    "now it follows from ( [ determinant ] ) that @xmath109    according to lemma [ lemma ] , the theta series of an even @xmath0-modular lattice @xmath17 of dimension @xmath94 can be written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 by ( [ theta and eta ] ) , we can write @xmath113 in terms of jacobi theta functions and compute the first few terms : @xmath114 the secrecy function of an even @xmath0-modular lattice @xmath17 of dimension @xmath5 is then written as @xmath115 or more conveniently , @xmath116 now we only need to know the coefficients @xmath117 in order to compute the weak secrecy gain of a @xmath0-modular lattice .",
