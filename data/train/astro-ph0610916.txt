    "the type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observational data has forced us to discard or change the majority of theoretical cosmological models supposed to be correct until the second half of the last decade @xcite .",
    "the crossing of the sne ia statistics with other observational data , like the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite , the x - ray gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters @xcite , etc , leads to a scenario where the matter content of the universe is described by an unclustered component of negative pressure , the dark energy , and a clustered component of zero pressure , the cold dark matter .",
    "there are many candidate for dark energy , the most natural seems to be the cosmological constant @xcite , since it can be connected with the vacuum energy in quantum field theory @xcite , but the small value resulting from observations for the energy density of the cosmological constant term yields a discrepancy of about @xmath2 orders of magnitude with the theoretically predicted value @xcite . among many other possibilities , for example",
    "there is the quintessence model with scalar fields @xcite .    here",
    "we will focus on the chaplygin gas models ( cgm ) @xcite .",
    "it is based on a string inspired configuration that leads to a specific equation of state where pressure is negative and varies with the inverse of the density @xcite .",
    "this model has been generalized , giving birth to the generalized chaplygin gas model ( gcgm ) , where now the pressure varies with a power of the inverse of the density @xcite .",
    "these proposals have many advantages , among which we can quote the following : in spite of presenting a negative pressure , the sound velocity is positive , what assures stability @xcite ; these models can unify the description of dark energy and dark matter , since the fluid can clusters at small scale , remaining a smooth component at large scales @xcite ; the cgm has an interesting connection with string theory @xcite .",
    "some criticisms have been addressed to the gcgm ( cgm ) mainly connected with its features related to the power spectrum for the agglomerated matter @xcite . however , in our opinion , this specific criticism is not conclusive , since the introduction of baryons may alleviate the objections presented against the cosmological scenarios based on the gcgm ( gcm ) @xcite .",
    "the gcgm ( generalized chaplygin gas model ) is defined as a perfect fluid with an equation of state given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants . when @xmath6 we re - obtain the equation of state for the cgm ( chaplygin gas model ) , the traditional chaplygin gas model .",
    "@xcite for more detailed definitions of the chaplygin gas models used in the present work .",
    "all free parameters for each model are considered . in the case of the gcgm",
    "there are five free parameter : the hubble constant @xmath7 ; the equation of state parameter @xmath5 ; the `` sound velocity '' related parameter @xmath8 ; the density parameter for the pressureless matter @xmath9 ; the density parameter for the chaplygin gas @xmath10 ( or alternatively the density parameter for the curvature density of the universe @xmath11 ) . for the cgm ,",
    "the number of parameters reduce to four , since @xmath6 .",
    "we also consider the @xmath12cdm , where the number of parameters reduce to three : @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( alternatively , @xmath13 ) .",
    "one important point is how to perform this statistical analysis : the final conclusions may , in some cases , depend on the statistical framework ( bayesian , frequentist , etc . ) , as well as on the parameters that are allowed to be free , and how these parameters are constrained ( through a joint probability for two parameters , minimizing the error function or through a marginalization of all parameters excepted one , etc . ) . in some cases",
    ", the different procedures adopted may lead to quite different conclusions on the best value for a given set of parameters .",
    "the choice of the observational data sample may of course be important as well .",
    "the present work is intended to :    1 .",
    "announce the first public version of * betocs * ( * * b**ay**e**sian * * t**ools for * * o**bservational * * c**osmology using * * s**ne ia @xcite ) , which is a powerful and high productivity tool aimed to help the theoretical physicist community investigate cosmological models using type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observational data .",
    "betocs is a freeware and open source tool written in the _ mathematica _",
    "@xcite language .",
    "the _ mathematica _ notebooks of betocs contain documentation , source code and practical examples with textual and graphical outputs",
    "emphasize that fixing @xmath7 is not acceptable , yielding arbitrary parameter estimations and usually bad best - fittings . on the other hand ,",
    "the hst ( hubble space telescope ) prior @xcite for @xmath7 implies minor effects on all best - fittings and parameter estimations ( as shown here comparing the tables with flat and hst priors for @xmath7 ) , so its use is just a matter of choice .",
    "nevertheless , it is recommended to use the hst prior as it is standard when using other observational cosmological data ( x - ray gas mass fraction , etc ) .",
    "3 .   continue the work of refs .",
    "@xcite and show a very complete view and analysis of the chaplygin gas models ( generalized and traditional ) using sne ia .",

    "b@xmath15ut the side - effects of this error were not critical , just worsening some positive features",
    ".    the best - fitting parameters and the parameter estimations were calculated for each case of gcgm , cgm or @xmath0cdm using a corresponding * betocs * ( * * b**ay**e**sian * * t**ools for * * o**bservational * * c**osmology using * * s**ne ia @xcite ) notebook ( written in _",

    "this article does not include all the graphics and analyses of the betocs notebooks , but some of them are available on the internet site of the betocs project @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sectionbestfitting ]",
    "we detail the best - fitting analysis using betocs , with many results presented in tables .",
    "section [ sectionparameterestimation ] explains how the parameter estimations are made using betocs , such that a detailed bayesian analysis is performed for each independent and dependent parameter , with the results shown in many tables and figures .",
    "the conclusions are discussed in section [ sectionconclusions ] .",
    "in order to compare the theoretical results with the observational data , the first step in this sense is to compute the quality of the fitting through the least squared fitting quantity @xmath20 . in the case of flat priors for all independent parameters of the theoretical cosmological model",
    ", we get @xmath21 in this expression , @xmath22 is the distance moduli observationaly measured for each supernova of the @xmath23 gold sne ia dataset @xcite , @xmath24 is the value calculated through the theoretical cosmological model , @xmath25 is the measurement error and includes the dispersion in the distance modulus due to the dispersion in galaxy redshift due to peculiar velocities , following ref .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath26 : @xmath20 divided by the number of degrees of freedom of the observational data , i.e. , the number of sne ia , here @xmath23 .",
    "as we also want to compare the fitting and estimation of the parameters without priors and with the hst ( hubble space telescope ) prior @xcite for @xmath7 , then the @xmath20 used for the calculations with the hst prior is simply @xmath27    .the best - fitting parameters , i.e. , when @xmath28 is minimum , for each type of spatial section and matter content of the generalized chaplygin gas model .",
    "@xmath7 is given in @xmath29 , @xmath30 in units of @xmath31 , @xmath32 in @xmath33 and @xmath34 in units of @xmath35 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that the marginalized estimations differs substantially from those extracted from the minimization of @xmath36 , which gives a large positive best value @xmath37 , but the dispersion is quite high , so even large positive values are not excluded , at least at @xmath38 level . and",
    "figure [ figsalphaa ] for the joint probabilities for @xmath37 and @xmath39 and figures [ figsalpha ] and [ figsa ] for @xmath37 and @xmath39 , respectively , clearly show that the marginalization process changes the peak values and credible regions depending on the number of dimensions .    of course , the cgm is obtained when @xmath37 is fixed to unity . from the analysis of the gcgm",
    "it can be inferred that @xmath40 , i.e. , the cgm is favoured with a probability of @xmath41 . restricting to null curvature or fixing the pressureless matter density increases considerably this value , from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "analogously , the probability to have @xmath44 ( with more physical meaning ) is @xmath45 and this value is quite increased when one or two parameters are fixed . both @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "are increased with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite .      like ref .",
    "@xcite , the results indicate that the value of @xmath8 is close to unity , but now the dispersion is slightly smaller . in the case of gcgm with no fixed parameters",
    ", the marginalization of the remaining four other parameters leads to @xmath48 .",
    "again , this could suggest the conclusion that @xmath12cdm ( @xmath49 ) model is favoured .",
    "however , the accuracy of the computation , due to the step ( between @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) used in the evaluation of the parameter , does not allow this conclusion .",
    "instead , it means the peak happens for @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , fixing the curvature or the pressureless matter , the preferred value differs slightly from unity , for example the quartessence scenario , @xmath53 , yields @xmath54 .",
    "but , differently from ref .",
    "@xcite , the cgm now predicts a best value for @xmath8 smaller than unity , @xmath55 , and the best value becomes smaller when one or two parameters are fixed .    in figure [ figsa ]",
    "the pdf for @xmath8 is displayed , both for the gcgm and the cgm , where the marginalization is made in all other parameters .",
    "note that the probability to have @xmath56 ( meaning how much the @xmath0cdm is rule out ) is zero only for the gcgm ( due to the step used in the evaluation of @xmath8 ) , but this probability varies from about @xmath57 to @xmath58 for other cases .    in figure [ figsalphaa ] the joint probabilities for @xmath37 and @xmath39 are displayed , with a non - gaussian shape . comparing with ref .",
    "@xcite , the peak values now happen for large values of @xmath37 and @xmath59 .",
    "this figure , compared to figures [ figsalpha ] and [ figsa ] , is an illustration of the importance of the marginalization process because it changes the peak values and credible regions depending on whether two or one - dimensional parameter space is used .      the unified scenario of quartessence , with no pressureless matter , is again favoured as , for example , the gcgm and cgm ( without fixed parameters ) predict @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the same estimations from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath64 , and ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath65 , show that the increased number of sne ia has substantially decreased the estimated error .",
    "compared to ref .",
    "@xcite , the dispersion is also highly decreased , which once more favours the quartessence scenario .",
    "the case of flat universe has an even smaller dispersion for the quartessence model .",
    "see figures [ figsgcgomegas ] and [ figscgomegas ] .    like ref .",
    "@xcite , the gcgm , the cgm and the @xmath0cdm remarkably lead to almost the same predictions concerning the dark energy component , @xmath61 , when all parameters are free : @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . by comparing with ref .",
    "@xcite , now @xmath61 ( which behaves as @xmath69 for @xmath70cdm ) has lower values and narrower dispersions , like @xmath60 , see figures [ figsgcgomegas][figslcdmomegas ] .",
    "the joint probability for @xmath60 and @xmath61 is now smoother for the gcgm and the cgm cases ( figure [ figcgccgomegam0c0 ] ) , with the @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 contours of figures [ figcgccgomegam0c0 ] and [ figlcdmomegam0c0 ] showing significantly smaller regions .",
    "so the analysis for @xmath0cdm is now quite in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .      in comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite , a closed universe is still clearly favoured , but with slightly smaller probability , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "but more important , the dispersion for @xmath74 is now substantially narrowed , as shown by figures [ figsgcgomegas][figslcdmomegas ] . the probability to have a flat universe , @xmath76 , is now greater ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 for gcgm , cgm and @xmath0cdm ) , and after setting the pressureless matter it increases , exception being the @xmath0cdm case .    with respect to refs .",
    "@xcite ( using the selected 26 sne ia data ) , the dispersion has also significantly decreased , for example : @xmath80 and @xmath81 versus @xmath82 @xcite and @xmath83 @xcite , for respectively gcgm and cgm .      due to the larger number of sne ia used here with respect to refs .",
    "@xcite , the dispersions have been quite decreased . for example , @xmath85 and @xmath86 estimated here for the gcgm and cgm versus @xmath87 @xcite and @xmath88 @xcite , respectively .    the predicted age of the universe when no parameter is fixed has increased with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , fortunately not anymore dangerously near the recent estimations age of the globular clusters @xcite , @xmath89 .",
    "the values for the deceleration parameter @xmath90 are increased ( less negative ) with respect to ref .",
    "the estimated errors are significantly smaller than the ones of refs .",
    "@xcite , for example : @xmath91 and @xmath92 versus @xmath93 @xcite and @xmath94 @xcite , for respectively gcgm and cgm .    in all cases , @xmath95 ,",
    "the probability to have an accelerating universe today , is equal to or very near @xmath96 .",
    "another useful quantity is the scale factor at the moment the universe begins to accelerate , @xmath34 , keeping in mind that the scale factor is normalized with its present value @xmath35 equal to unity .",
    "with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath34 decreases when no parameter is fixed . as expected , the larger number of supernovae in comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite yields smaller credible intervals for @xmath34 , for example @xmath97 estimated here for gcgm versus @xmath98 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the probability the universe begins to accelerate before today , @xmath99 in tables [ tableparestgcg] [ tableparestlcdmp ] , is essentially @xmath58 , being approximately the same value of the probability to have an accelerating universe today , i.e. , @xmath95 .",
    "theoretically they should be the same , so the fact that these independent probability calculations agree almost exactly shows the accuracy and reliability of the bayesian probability analyses of this work .",
    "the present work has performed the most extensive analysis of  the gcgm and cgm in what concerns the comparison of theoretical predictions with the type ia supernovae data , using the 157 data of the `` gold sample '' . by using the high productivity of * betocs * ( * * b**ay**e**sian * * t**ools for * * o**bservational * * c**osmology using * * s**ne ia @xcite ) , it was possible to make all the best - fittings , parameter estimations and figures shown here .",

    "one important result concerns the hubble parameter , @xmath7 .",
    "it is not acceptable to fix its value because arbitrary parameter estimations and usually bad best - fittings are obtained .",
    "as the hst ( hubble space telescope ) prior @xcite for @xmath7 implies minor effects on all results , we can choose a flat or hst prior .",
    "the cgm ( traditional chaplygin gas model ) , where @xmath6 , remains competitive and preferred in many cases : when the five parameters are considered , the probability is @xmath41 , but increases as much as to @xmath103 for the quartessence scenario .    for the parameter @xmath8 , both gcgm and cgm cases of fixed curvature and matter densities shows a value near but small than @xmath19 as the best value of @xmath104 , such that the @xmath12cdm case ( @xmath49 ) is almost ruled out .",
