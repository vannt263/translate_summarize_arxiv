    "members of the family show rich and complex electronic and magnetic properties , including charge density wave ( cdw ) transitions in laagsb@xmath0 @xcite , anisotropic , ferromagnetic , kondo - lattice behavior in ceagsb@xmath0 @xcite and low temperature , crystalline electric field ( cef ) governed metamagnetism in ragsb@xmath0 compounds with r = heavy rare earth .",
    "@xcite recent increased attention to this family is partially due to the successful growth of high quality single crystals @xcite that are suitable for detailed , anisotropic thermodynamic and transport measurements as well as for studies of the fermi surfaces ( fs ) of these materials through measurements of quantum oscillations .",

    "yagsb@xmath0 behaves as a rather simple , normal metal with no phase transitions observed at ambient pressure below the room temperature @xcite .",
    "temperature - dependent resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements on laagsb@xmath0 show two features , a stronger one at @xmath10 k and more subtle one at @xmath11 k @xcite .",
    "the features in resistivity are reminiscent of charge density wave ( cdw ) transitions .",
    "an x - ray scattering study @xcite revealed that indeed both features are the signatures of cdw orderings , with the one at @xmath12 corresponding to a development of periodic charge / lattice modulation along the @xmath13-axis with the wave vector @xmath14 and the one at @xmath15 marking an additional cdw ordering along the @xmath1-axis with the wave vector @xmath16 .",
    "both cdw orderings were shown to be consistent with the enhanced nesting in the different parts of the laagsb@xmath0 fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the higher temperature cdw transition was shown to be very sensitive to pressure and/or rare - earth - site substitution @xcite . in both doped samples",

    "it should be mentioned that the pressure derivatives of the higher temperature cdw transition temperatures in the two doped samples differ by more than a factor of two from each other @xcite .",
    "since the anisotropic thermal expansion data in the ragsb@xmath0 family are available only for ceagsb@xmath0 @xcite ( data for polycrystalline laagsb@xmath0 are also presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) we deem it to be desirable , specifically for detailed analysis of the results similar to one in ref .",
    "@xcite to have experimental te data for a non - magnetic analogue .",
    "furthermore , anisotropic pressure derivatives of cdw , curie and nel transition temperatures may be estimated by combining heat capacity and anisotropic te data , potentially shedding some light on the reason for the variation of the @xmath19 for the different materials under study .",
    "plate - like ragsb@xmath0 crystals were solution grown @xcite from sb - rich self - flux ( see refs . @xcite for further details on growth procedure ) .",
    "thermal expansion data were obtained using a capacitive dilatometer constructed of ofhc copper ; a detailed description of the dilatometer is presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the dilatometer was mounted in a quantum design ppms-14 instrument and was operated over a temperature range of 1.8 to 300 k in magnetic field up to 140 koe .",
    "the samples were cut and polished so as to have parallel surfaces perpendicular to the @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] directions with the distances @xmath22 between the surfaces ranging between @xmath23 mm .",
    "heat capacity of the samples was measured using a hybrid adiabatic relaxation technique of the heat capacity option in a quantum design ppms-14 .",
    "field dependent magnetization for several samples was measured using a quantum design mpms-7 squid magnetometer .",
    "the pressure dependence of the nel temperature of smagsb@xmath0 was measured by following , as a function of pressure , the sharp feature ( caused by loss of spin - disorder scattering at @xmath24 ) in the in - plane resistance .",
    "pressure was generated in a teflon cup filled with 60:40 mixture of n - pentane and light mineral oil inserted in a 33 mm outer diameter , non - magnetic , piston - cylinder - type , be - cu pressure cell with a core made of nicral ( 40 khnyu - vi ) alloy .",
    "the pressure at room temperature was monitored by a manganin , resistive pressure gauge . at low temperatures",
    "the pressure value was determined from the superconducting transition temperature of pure lead @xcite .",
    "the temperature environment for the pressure cell was provided by a ppms instrument . near the nel transition",
    "the temperature was changed at 0.5 k / min rate and stabilized at every measured point ( so that the effective rate was about 0.2 k / min ) .",
    "an additional cernox sensor , attached to the body of the cell , served to determine the temperature of the sample for these measurements ( the temperature difference between the ppms sensor and the sensor on the cell depends both on the temperature range and on the nominal cooling / warming rate and in our was ranging between few tenths of a degree at low temperatures and few degrees near room temperature ) .",
    "the electronic structure of yagsb@xmath0 was calculated using the atomic sphere approximation , tight binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto - asa ) method @xcite within the local density approximation ( lda ) with barth - hedin @xcite exchange - correlation at experimental values of the lattice parameters @xmath25 and under conditions of uniaxial stress @xmath26 and uniaxial pressure @xmath27 ( @xmath28 of the @xmath29 value ) . the unit cell volume and the sizes of the atomic spheres were kept constant in the calculations .",
    "a self - consistency of the potential was obtained using 637 @xmath30 points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone .",
    "the fermi surface was calculated using 18081 @xmath30 points .",
    "the anisotropic thermal expansion of yagsb@xmath0 is shown in fig . [ f1 ] . in - plane thermal expansion is larger than that along the @xmath1-axis by factor of @xmath31 .",
    "the data can be represented , reasonably well ( dashed lines in fig .",

    "the debye temperature , @xmath33 k , used in this fit is well within the range of the @xmath34 values evaluated for other ragsb@xmath0 ( r = rare earth ) materials @xcite .",
    "magnetostriction of yagsb@xmath0 at the base temperature is rather small , @xmath35 at 140 koe for both orientations of the applied magnetic field . when magnetic field is applied along the @xmath1-axis , clear de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) - like oscillations of the ms",
    "are observed ( fig .",
    "these oscillations are observed up to at least 25 k. a fast fourier transform ( fft ) of these data allows for identification of four frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ f2]a , inset ) , consistent with those observed in torque and magnetization @xcite .",
    "the effective masses corresponding to these frequencies are consistent with those reported earlier @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of quantum oscillations in ms is a known phenomenon @xcite , however observations of such oscillations are rather rare , since both large , high quality single crystals and sensitive dilatometers are required .",
    "the amplitude of the ms oscillations along the @xmath36-axis , @xmath37 , can be written as @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the amplitude of the oscillations in magnetization , @xmath40 is a magnetic field ( we will not distinguish between @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the materials studied in this work ) , @xmath42 is the extremal cross - sectional area of the fermi surface perpendicular to the direction of the applied field and @xmath43 is the stress along the @xmath36-axis . from the equation above one can see that the oscillations in ms can be used to study fermi surfaces of metals on a par with more traditional quantum oscillations in magnetization and magnetoresistance .",
    "due to the additional factor , @xmath44 , the orbits with high sensitivity to stress have a chance to be resolved easier by magnetostriction measurements ( and vice versa , stress - insensitive orbits can be easily missed ) . finally , if the same orbit is detected in both , magnetization and ms measurements ( preferably on the same sample ) , the stress derivative of the extremal cross - sectional area of the fermi surface can be estimated .",
    "such estimates are potentially very useful since the direct measurement of fermi surfaces under uniaxial stress is difficult and rare .",
    "[ f3 ] shows the oscillations corresponding to the @xmath2 orbit ( in notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) as seen by ms and magnetization . using the equation above",
    ", the uniaxial stress derivative for this orbit is estimated to be @xmath45 @xmath46/dyne . in principle",
    ", one can obtain the uniaxial stress derivatives of the non - dominant frequencies by comparing the corresponding fft amplitudes , in such case care should be taken to determine the relative phase of the magnetization and ms oscillations which defines the sign of the stress derivative .",
    "the calculated @xmath47 cross - section of the yagsb@xmath0 fermi surface for different @xmath29 values is shown in fig .",
    "these calculations are consistent with the previous publications @xcite . cross - section areas of several fermi surface sheets , @xmath2 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , increase under uniaxial pressure along the @xmath1-axis ( @xmath50 ) and decrease under uniaxial stress along the @xmath1-axis ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "qualitatively , the computational results for @xmath2 orbit are consistent with the aforementioned experimental data .",
    "quantitative comparison between the band structure calculations and the experiment requires use of the elastic constants tensor for yagsb@xmath0 that is not known at this point .",
    "the anisotropic , temperature - dependent thermal expansion of smagsb@xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "near room temperature the thermal expansion of smagsb@xmath0 is similar to that of yagsb@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "on cooling , @xmath52 changes sign to negative below @xmath53 k , passes through a broad minimum around 50 k and then changes sign again at @xmath54 k. the behavior of @xmath55 between the room temperature and @xmath54 k is less dramatic , although the difference from the @xmath55 behavior in yagsb@xmath0 is clearly seen below @xmath56 k. these features in the smagsb@xmath0 are possibly related to the crystalline electric field ( cef ) effects ( c.f . with the data of ceagsb@xmath0 @xcite ) . at the same time the volume thermal expansion @xmath57 in the @xmath58 k temperature range is similar for both materials ( figs .",
    "[ f1],[f5 ] ) .",
    "clear , @xmath59-shaped , features associated with the long range order antiferromagnetic transition at @xmath60 k @xcite are seen in heat capacity and linear and volume thermal expansion ( fig . [ f5](b ) ) .",
    "the peak in @xmath61 is negative for the measurements along the @xmath13-axis and positive along the @xmath1-axis , that sums up to a ( smaller ) positive peak in volume thermal expansion @xmath57 , these signs are opposite to the ones observed at the ferromagnetic transition in ceagsb@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the initial uniaxial pressure derivatives of the second order phase transitions can be estimated using the ehrenfest relation @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the molar volume , @xmath64 is a change of the linear ( @xmath65 ) or volume ( @xmath66 ) thermal expansion coefficient at the phase transition , and @xmath67 is a change of the specific heat at the phase transition . using experimental values : @xmath68 m@xmath69/mol , @xmath60 k , @xmath70 k@xmath71 , @xmath72 k@xmath71 , @xmath73 k@xmath71 , and @xmath74 j / mol k , we can estimate initial uniaxial and hydrostatic pressure derivatives of the nel temperature in smagsb@xmath0 : @xmath75 k / kbar , @xmath76 k / kbar , @xmath77 k / kbar , so the nel temperature decreases under uniaxial pressure along the @xmath13-axis and increases ( with almost factor of three higher rate ) under uniaxial pressure along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "estimated hydrostatic pressure derivative can be compared with the measured value .",
    "[ f6 ] shows the in - plane resistance of smagsb@xmath0 as a function of pressure .",
    "room temperature resistivity decreases under pressure with the derivative , @xmath78 kbar@xmath71 ( room temperature value of pressure were used for this estimate , see e.g. @xcite for a discussion of pressure - temperature relation in a piston - cylinder cells ) .",
    "similar but factor of @xmath79 faster decrease of the room temperature resistivity was also observed for laagsb@xmath0 @xcite . at low temperatures , just above the magnetic transition , resistivity of smagsb@xmath0 increases under pressure and at base temperature , 2 k",
    ", it is practically pressure - independent , consistent with the residual resistivity being pressure - independent in our measurements .",
    "the nel temperature of smagsb@xmath0 increases with pressure ( fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , upper left inset ) .",
    "two criteria were used to determine @xmath24 : an onset of @xmath80 and a maximum in @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the latter criterion gives @xmath24 values consistent with thermodynamic measurements , whereas the former yields slightly higher @xmath24 , still both of them give similar pressure derivatives , @xmath82 k / kbar and @xmath83 k / kbar , for the onset and @xmath81 maximum criteria respectively .",
    "the estimate of the @xmath84 from the ehrenfest relation is consistent with the direct measurements in its sign but gives a value that is almost a factor of two larger than that measured .",
    "however , in terms of absolute amounts this difference is rather small ( @xmath85 k / kbar ) and is probably due to the the accumulation of the error bars from all three measurements . + quantum oscillations in the longitudinal ms were readily observed for @xmath86 k in smagsb@xmath0 for @xmath87 $ ] ( fig .",
    "[ f7](a ) ) . a fft spectrum of these oscillations at @xmath88 k is shown in fig . [ f7](b ) .",
    "the spectra is more complex than that of yagsb@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) and is in general agreement with the previous works @xcite .",
    "several details are noteworthy : the dominant frequency in the ms oscillations is @xmath89 , @xmath90 mg , the @xmath91 frequency , first reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , is seen adjacent to the @xmath2 frequency in the ms measurements as well .",
    "a very small , new , frequency , marked here as @xmath92 ( @xmath93 mg ) , appears to be present in the spectrum .",
    "band structure calculations usually are not reliable in description of such small fs pockets .",
    "detailed experimental studies are required to unambiguously exclude an artifactitious origin of this frequency .",
    "finally , our data suggest that the frequency ( slightly lower than 3 mg ) identified in ref . @xcite as a third harmonic of @xmath2-frequency , is actually an independent orbit , marked here as @xmath48 ( @xmath94 mg ) .",
    "the amplitude of this frequency in ms measurements is almost factor of two higher than that of @xmath2 , that makes its initial identification as @xmath95 unlikely @xcite .",
    "based on band structure calculations for smagsb@xmath0 @xcite it seems natural to associate this frequency with the @xmath48 external orbit on the band 1 doughnut - shaped part of the fs .",
    "angular - dependent quantum oscillations measurements are desirable to confirm the assignment of this frequency .",
    "effective masses for several of the frequencies are shown in the right inset to fig . [ f7](b ) .",
    "the values of @xmath96 ( @xmath97 is a free electron mass ) are between 0.1 and 0.3 .",
    "the effective mass of the @xmath48-orbit is significantly less than a triple of the @xmath2-orbit effective mass , consistent with our re - identification of the 2.82 mg frequency .",
    "qualitatively similar to the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite , the amplitude of the @xmath89 oscillations as a function of temperature has a break at the temperature corresponding to the @xmath24 in smagsb@xmath0 , whereas the phase of these oscillations does not change at @xmath24 ( fig .",

    "two cdw transitions @xcite are clearly seen in the thermal expansion data : the higher temperature transition manifests itself in both , @xmath55 and @xmath52 , whereas the lower temperature transition can be distinguished only in @xmath52 ; both transitions are seen in the volume thermal expansion , @xmath57 .",
    "these two cdw transitions are also resolved in heat capacity measurements ( fig .",
