    "since superfluidity was first realized in ultracold trapped two - component atomic fermi gases  @xcite , there has been increasing interest in the properties of spin - polarized fermi superfluids  @xcite . as in unpolarized fermi gas superfluids , by making use of a feshbach scattering resonance between fermions , the effective scattering length @xmath3 that characterizes low - energy scattering between fermions in different hyperfine states ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) can be continuously tuned from negative to positive values .",

    "<S> in the strong - coupling bec region where a feshbach resonance gives rise to tightly - bound dimer molecules , we show that a spin - polarized fermi superfluid reduces to a simple bose - fermi mixture of bose - condensed dimers and the leftover unpaired fermions . using a many - body functional integral formalism , </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian fluctuations give rise to an induced dimer - dimer interaction mediated by the unpaired fermions , with the dimer - fermion vertex being given by the ( mean - field ) born approximation . treating the pairing fluctuations to quartic order </S>",
    "<S> , we show how the action for a spin - polarized fermi superfluid reduces to one for a bose - fermi mixture . </S>",
    "<S> this bose - fermi action includes an expression for the effective dimer - unpaired fermion interaction in a spin - polarized fermi superfluid beyond the born approximation , in the superfluid phase at finite temperatures . in the low - density limit , </S>",
    "<S> we show how this dimer - fermion interaction gives the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the @xmath0-wave fermion scattering length ) , a result first derived by skorniakov and ter - martirosian in 1957 for three interacting fermions .    0 * 0 * </S>"
