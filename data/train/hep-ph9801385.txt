    "technicolor  the strong interaction of fermions and gauge bosons at the scale @xmath3describes the breakdown of electroweak symmetry to electromagnetism _ without _ elementary scalar bosons  @xcite . in its simplest",
    "form , technicolor is a scaled - up version of qcd , with massless technifermions whose chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken at @xmath4 .",
    "if left and right - handed technifermions are assigned to weak @xmath5 doublets and singlets , respectively , then @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the _ technipion _ decay constant ,   and @xmath8 of the weak gauge bosons . ]",
    "analogous to @xmath9 for the ordinary pion .",
    "the principal signals in hadron and lepton collider experiments of `` classical '' technicolor were discussed long ago  @xcite . in the minimal technicolor model , with just one technifermion doublet , the only prominent collider signals are the enhancements in longitudinally - polarized weak boson production .",
    "these are the @xmath10-channel color - singlet technirho resonances near 1.52  tev : @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 cross sections of these processes are quite small at such masses .",
    "this and the difficulty of reconstructing weak - boson pairs with reasonable efficiency make observing these enhancements a challenge .",
    "nonminimal technicolor models are much more accessible because they have a rich spectrum of lower mass technirho vector mesons and technipion states into which they may decay",
    ".   if there are @xmath14 doublets of technifermions , all transforming according to the same complex representation of the technicolor gauge group , there will be @xmath15 technipions whose decay constant is [ eq : ft ] f_t = .",
    "three of these are the longitudinal weak bosons ; the remaining @xmath16 await discovery .    in the standard model and its extensions , the masses of quarks and leptons",
    "are produced by their yukawa couplings to the higgs bosons ",
    "couplings of arbitrary magnitude and phase that are put in by hand .",
    "this option is not available in technicolor because there are no elementary scalars . instead ,",
    "quark and lepton chiral symmetries must be broken explicitly _ by gauge interactions alone_. the most economical way to do this is to employ extended technicolor , a gauge group containing flavor , color and technicolor as subgroups  @xcite .",
    "quarks , leptons and technifermions are unified into a few large representations of etc .",
    "the etc gauge symmetry is broken at high energy to technicolor @xmath17 color .",
    "then quark and lepton hard masses arise from their coupling ( with strength @xmath18 ) to technifermions via etc gauge bosons of generic mass @xmath19 : [ eq : qmass ] m_q ( ) m _ ( ) , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the technifermion condensate and quark and lepton masses renormalized at the scale @xmath19 .",
    "if technicolor is like qcd , with a running coupling @xmath22 rapidly becoming small above @xmath3 , then @xmath23 . to obtain quark masses of a few  gev , @xmath24 is required .",
    "this is excluded : extended technicolor boson exchanges also generate four - quark interactions which , typically , include @xmath25 and @xmath26 operators . for these not to be in conflict with @xmath27-@xmath28 and @xmath29-@xmath30 mixing parameters , @xmath31 must exceed several hundred tev  @xcite .",
    "this implies quark and lepton masses no larger than a few mev , and technipion masses no more than a few  gev  a phenomenological disaster .",
    "because of this conflict between constraints on flavor - changing neutral currents and the magnitude of etc - generated quark , lepton and technipion masses , classical technicolor was superseded over a decade ago by `` walking '' technicolor  @xcite . here , the strong technicolor coupling @xmath22 runs very slowly  walks  for a large range of momenta , possibly all the way up to the etc scale of several hundred tev .",
    "the slowly - running coupling enhances @xmath32 by almost a factor of @xmath33 .",
    "this , in turn , allows quark and lepton masses as large as a few  gev and @xmath34 to be generated from etc interactions at @xmath35 .    walking technicolor requires a large number of technifermions in order that @xmath22 runs slowly .",
    "these fermions may belong to many copies of the fundamental representation of the technicolor gauge group , to a few higher dimensional representations , or to both .  .",
    "multiscale models in which the entire top quark mass is generated by etc interactions are excluded by such processes as @xmath36  @xcite . ]    in many respects , walking technicolor models are very different from qcd with a few fundamental @xmath37 representations .",
    "one example of this is that integrals of weak - current spectral functions and their moments converge much more slowly than they do in qcd .",
    "consequently , simple dominance of the spectral integrals by a few resonances can not be correct .",
    "this and other calculational tools based on naive scaling from qcd and on large-@xmath38 arguments are suspect  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not yet possible to predict with confidence the influence of technicolor degrees of freedom on precisely - measured electroweak quantities  the @xmath39 parameters to name the most discussed example  @xcite .    the large mass of the top quark  @xcite motivated another major development in technicolor .",
    "theorists have concluded that etc models can not explain the top quark s large mass without running afoul of experimental constraints from the @xmath40 parameter and the @xmath41 decay rate  @xcite .",
    "this state of affairs has led to the proposal of `` topcolor - assisted technicolor '' ( tc2 )  @xcite .    in tc2 , as in top - condensate models of electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite , almost all of the top quark mass arises from a new strong `` topcolor '' interaction  @xcite .",
    "to maintain electroweak symmetry between ( left - handed ) top and bottom quarks and yet not generate @xmath42 , the topcolor gauge group under which @xmath43 transform is usually taken to be a strongly - coupled @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 provides the difference that causes only top quarks to condense .",
    "then , in order that topcolor interactions be natural  i.e . , that their energy scale not be far above @xmath46without introducing large weak isospin violation , it is necessary that electroweak symmetry breaking remain due mostly to technicolor interactions  @xcite .",
    "early steps in the development of the tc2 scenario have been taken in two recent papers@xcite .",
    "the breaking of topcolor @xmath44 near the electroweak scale gives rise to a massive color octet of @xmath47 colorons and a color - singlet @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath37 may be broken by some of the same technifermion condensates that break electroweak @xmath49 , so that the colorons ( which are expected to be broad ) have mass near 500  gev .",
    "however , in order that the strong topcolor @xmath45 interaction not contaminate the ordinary @xmath50 couplings to fermions , it and the weaker @xmath45 acting on light fermions must be broken down to their diagonal subgroup , ordinary weak hypercharge , in the vicinity of 2  tev .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath48 mass is in the range 13  tev , out of reach of all but the highest energy colliders . as i discussed in my talk at the fmc workshop ,",
    "the @xmath48 is so heavy that it may require a multi - tev big muon collider to find and study it .",
    "this subject deserves further study .    in tc2 models , etc interactions",
    "are still needed to generate the light and bottom quark masses , contribute a few  gev to @xmath46 ,   is needed to give them a mass in the range of 150250  gev . ] and give mass to the technipions .",
    "the scale of etc interactions still must be hundreds of  tev to suppress flavor - changing neutral currents and , so , the technicolor coupling still must walk .",
    "thus , even though the phenomenology of tc2 is still in its infancy , it is expected to share general features with multiscale technicolor : many technifermion doublets bound into many technihadron states , some at relatively low masses , some carrying ordinary color and some not .",
    "the lightest technihadrons may have masses in the range 100300  gev and should be accessible at the tevatron collider in run  iii if not run  ii .",
    "all of them are easily produced and detected at the lhc at moderate luminosities .",
    "if technihadrons exist , they will be discovered at hadron colliders before the first muon collider ( fmc ) is built .",
    "as we shall see , this is a good thing for the fmc : several of the lightest technihadrons are very narrow and can be produced in the @xmath10-channel of @xmath51 annihilations . in the narrow - band fmc , it would be exceedingly difficult to find them by a standard scan procedure without a good idea of where to look .",
    "i assume that the technicolor gauge group is @xmath52 and take @xmath53 in calculations .",
    "its gauge coupling must walk and i assume this is achieved by a large number of isodoublets of technifermions transforming according to the fundamental representation of @xmath52 .",
    "i consider the phenomenology of only the lightest color - singlet technihadrons and assume that the constraint from the @xmath54-parameter on their spectrum still allows the lightest ones to be considered in isolation for a _ limited _ range of @xmath55 , the @xmath51 center - of - mass energy , about their masses .",
    "these technihadrons carry isospin @xmath56 and  0 and consist of a single isotriplet and isosinglet of vectors , @xmath1 , @xmath57 and @xmath2 , and pseudoscalars @xmath0 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the latter are in addition to the longitudinal weak bosons , @xmath60 and @xmath61those linear combinations of technipions that couple to the electroweak gauge currents .",
    "i adopt tc2 as a guide for guessing phenomenological generalities . in tc2",
    "there is no need for large technifermion isospin splitting associated with the top - bottom mass difference .",
    "this implies that the lightest @xmath62 and @xmath2 are approximately degenerate .",
    "the lightest charged and neutral technipions also should have roughly the same mass , but there may be appreciable @xmath0@xmath59 mixing .",
    "if that happens , the lightest neutral technipions are really @xmath63 and @xmath64 bound states . finally ,",
    "for purposes of discussing signals at the fmc , we take the lightest technihadron masses to be [ eq : tmasses ] m _ m _ ~200 ; m _ ~100 .",
    "the decays of technipions are induced mainly by etc interactions which couple them to quarks and leptons .",
    "these couplings are higgs - like , and so technipions are expected to decay into the heaviest fermion pairs allowed . because only a few gev of the top - quark s mass is generated by etc , there is no great preference for @xmath65 to decay to top quarks nor for top quarks to decay into them .",
    "furthermore , the isosinglet component of neutral technipions may decay into a pair of gluons _ if _ its constituent technifermions are colored .",
    "thus , the predominant decay modes of the light technipions are assumed to be [ eq : tpidecay ] b b , c c , ^+^- + gg , b b , c c , ^+^- + c b , c s , ^+_. + to estimate branching ratios we use the following decay rates ( for later use in the technihadron production cross sections , we quote the energy - dependent width  @xcite ) :  . ] [ eq : tpiwidths ] ( f f ) & = & 1 n_f p_f c^2_f ( m_f + m_f)^2 +   + ( gg ) & = & 1 ^2_s c _ ^2 s^3 . here",
    ", @xmath66 is an etc - model dependent factor of order one _ except _ that tc2 suggests @xmath67 ; @xmath68 is the number of colors of fermion  @xmath69 ; @xmath70 is the fermion momentum ; @xmath71 is the qcd coupling evaluated at @xmath72 ; and @xmath73 is a clebsch of order one . for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 for @xmath0 and @xmath59 , and @xmath80 : [ eq : tpiwidthvals ] ( b b )",
    "= ( b b ) = 35 +   + ( gg ) = 10 .",
    "+ if technicolor were like qcd , we would expect the main decay modes of the lightest technivector mesons to be @xmath81 and @xmath82 with the technihadrons",
    "all composed of the same technifermions . however , the large ratio @xmath32 occurring in walking technicolor significantly enhances technipion masses compared to technivector masses .",
    "thus , @xmath83 decay channels may well be closed .",
    "if this happens , then @xmath1 decays to @xmath84 or @xmath85 and @xmath2 to @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "@xcite    we parameterize this for @xmath62 decays by adopting a simple model of two isotriplets of technipions which are mixtures of @xmath88 , @xmath8 and mass - eigenstate technipions @xmath58 , @xmath0 .",
