    "[ [ section ] ]    _ graph hypersurfaces _ are hypersurfaces of projective space associated with the parametric formulation of feynman integrals in scalar quantum field theories .",
    "the study of their geometry was prompted by certain conjectures concerning the appearance of multiple zeta values in the results of computation of feynman amplitudes , and has been the object of intense investigation ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and many others ) . in this paper",
    "we study chern classes of graph hypersurfaces , from the point of view of deletion - contraction and multiple - edge formulas .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    ` algebro - geometric feynman rules ' are invariants of graphs which only depend on the isomorphism class of the corresponding hypersurfaces , and have controlled behavior with respect to unions .",
    "( this definition of course captures only a very small portion of the quantum field theory feynman rules ; it would be very interesting to have examples of algebro - geometric feynman rules mirroring more faithfully their physical counterparts . )",
    "matilde marcolli and the author note in @xcite that the classes of graph hypersurfaces in the grothendieck ring of varieties satisfy this basic requirement ; grothendieck classes of graph hypersurfaces have been studied rather thoroughly , given their relevance to the conjectures mentioned above .",
    "in the same paper we produced a different example of algebro - geometric feynman rules , with values in @xmath0 $ ] , based on the _ chern classes _ of graph hypersurfaces .",
    "the definition of this polynomial invariant @xmath1 will be recalled below ; its main interest lies in the fact that it carries intersection - theoretic information about the singularities of graph hypersurfaces .",
    "for example , the ( push - forward to projective space of the ) segre class of the singularity subscheme of a hypersurface may be recovered from the polynomial feynman rules .",
    "the milnor number of the hypersurface ( in its natural generalization to arbitrary hypersurfaces as defined by parusiski , @xcite ) is but one piece of the information carried by @xmath1 .",
    "the fact that the invariant satisfies the basic requirements of algebro - geometric feynman rules is proved in @xcite , theorem  3.6 , and is substantially less straightforward than the corresponding fact for grothendieck classes .",
    "grothendieck classes of graph hypersurfaces also satisfy a ` deletion - contraction ' relation : this fact has been pointed out by several authors , see e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to examine deletion - contraction relations for chern classes of graph hypersurfaces , in terms of the polynomial feynman rules mentioned above . as in @xcite",
    ", it is natural to expect the situation for chern classes to be substantially subtler than for classes in the grothendieck ring , and in fact our first guess concerning a double - edge formula for chern classes , based on somewhat extensive evidence computed for small graphs , turns out to be _ incorrect _ as stated in conjecture  6.1 in  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will be able to show here that these invariants do satisfy the expected general structure underlying multiple - edge formulas examined in @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the _ graph hypersurface _ associated with a graph @xmath2 is the zero - set of the polynomial @xmath3 where @xmath4 ranges over the maximal spanning forests of @xmath2 .",
    "this is a homogeneous polynomial in variables @xmath5 corresponding to the edges @xmath6 of @xmath2 , and its zero set may be viewed in @xmath7 or @xmath8 , depending on the context .",
    "graph hypersurfaces are singular in all but the simplest cases , and in this article ( as in @xcite ) we employ the theory of _ chern - schwartz - macpherson _ ( csm ) classes .",
    "csm classes are defined for arbitrary varieties , and agree with the ordinary ( total homology ) chern class of the tangent bundle when evaluated on nonsingular varieties",
    ". the reader may refer to  2.2 - 3 of @xcite for a quick summary of this theory , which has a long and well - documented history .",
    "csm classes can be viewed as a generalization of the topological euler characteristic : indeed , the degree of the csm class of a variety _ is _ its euler characteristic , and to some extent csm classes maintain the same additive and multiplicative behavior of the euler characteristic . in this respect",
    "they are similar in flavor to the grothendieck class .",
    "they also offer a direct measure of ` how singular ' a variety is , by comparison with other characteristic classes of singular varieties , see e.g.   2.2 in @xcite and references therein .",
    "csm classes are in fact defined for _ constructible functions _ on a variety ( @xcite ) , and what we call the csm class of @xmath9 is the class @xmath10 of the constant function  @xmath11",
    ". as our objects of study are hypersurfaces of projective space , we view csm classes as elements of the chow group of projective space , i.e. , as polynomials in the hyperplane class .",
    "the polynomial feynman rules mentioned above are closely related to the csm class of the _ complement _ of a graph hypersurface @xmath12 : if a graph @xmath2 with @xmath13 edges is not a forest , then the polynomial feynman rules @xmath1 are determined by the relation @xmath14\\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denotes the hyperplane class ; see prop .",
    "3.7 in @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    in graph theory , _ deletion - contraction _ formulas express invariants for a graph @xmath2 directly in terms of invariants for the ` deletion ' graph @xmath16 obtained by removing an edge @xmath6 , and the ` contraction ' graph @xmath17 obtained by contracting the same edge . _ tutte - grothendieck",
    "_ invariants are the most general invariants with controlled behavior with respect to deletion - contraction ; an impressive list of important graph invariants are of this kind , ranging from chromatic polynomials to partition functions for potts models .",
    "in fact , these invariants may be viewed as ` feynman rules ' in a sense closely related to the one adopted in @xcite , see prop .  2.2 in  @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we show that the invariant arising from the grothendieck class satisfies a weak form of deletion - contraction ( which involves ` non - combinatorial ' terms ) ; and that enough of this structure is preserved to trigger combinatorial ` multiple - edge ' formulas .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath18 $ ] denote the grothendieck class of the complement of the affine graph hypersurface , and denote by @xmath19 the graph obtained by doubling the edge @xmath6 in @xmath2 . if @xmath6 is neither a bridge nor a looping edge , then ( @xcite , proposition  5.2 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the class of @xmath22 .",
    "note that ( * ) holds without further requirements on  @xmath6 .",
    "( simpler formulas hold in case @xmath6 is a bridge or a looping edge . )",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    as we will show in this paper , the situation concerning the polynomial invariant  @xmath1 recalled above is somewhat different . as in the case of the grothendieck class ,",
    "this invariant does not satisfy on the nose a deletion - contraction relation ( this was already observed in @xcite , prop .",
    "3.2 ) . unlike in the case of the invariant  @xmath23",
    ", however , even a weaker non - combinatorial form of deletion - contraction only holds under special hypotheses on the edge @xmath6 .",
    "the main result of this article is the determination of conditions on a pair @xmath24 such that a sufficiently strong deletion - contraction relation ( and corresponding consequences , such as multiple - edge formulas ) holds for the edge @xmath6 of  @xmath2 .",
    "these conditions are presented in  [ condis ] ; somewhat surprisingly , they appear to hold for ` many ' graphs .",
    "one of them can be formulated as follows .",
    "assume that @xmath6 is neither a bridge nor a looping edge of @xmath2 .",
    "we may consider the polynomial @xmath25 for the deletion @xmath16 .",
    "the condition is then that @xmath26 _ belongs to the jacobian ideal of @xmath25 . _",
    "the smallest counterexample to this requirement appears to be the graph        with respect to the vertical edge .",
    "we find it surprising that this condition is satisfied as often as it is .",
    "the second condition is more technical .",
    "see  [ condis ] for a discussion of both conditions .",
    "once a ( weak ) deletion - contraction formula is available , one should expect combinatorial multiple - edge formulas to hold . and",
    "indeed , we will prove the following analogue of ( * ) for the chern class feynman rules :    [ double ] if the conditions on @xmath27 mentioned above are satisfied , then @xmath28    this is the formula that was proposed in @xcite , conjecture  6.1 , on the basis of many examples computed explicitly in @xcite .",
    "however , the additional conditions on @xmath27 had not been identified at the time ; the formula proposed in _ loc .",
    "_ for the class of a triangle with doubled edges is incorrect , and will be corrected here in example  [ doubletriangex ] .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    as mentioned above , we do not have a sharp combinatorial characterization on @xmath27 ensuring that the technical hypotheses needed for theorem  [ double ] are satisfied .",
    "however , there is one important case in which we are able to prove that these conditions are indeed satisfied : the conditions hold if @xmath6 is itself a multiple edge , i.e. , if the endpoints of @xmath6 are adjacent in @xmath16 .",
    "thus , theorem  [ double ] implies that the polynomial feynman rules satisfy essentially the same recursive structure for multiple - edge formulas that is studied in general in @xcite ,  6 . if @xmath6 is neither a bridge nor a looping edge of  @xmath2 , then @xmath29 in a sense , this recursion is ` nicer ' than the corresponding one for grothendieck classes ( see the comments following lemma  [ recurs ] ) .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    this paper is organized as follows . in   [ condis ] we state precisely the technical conditions mentioned above , in the case of graph hypersurfaces , providing a few simple examples to illustrate them .",
    "this is also done in the hope that others may identify sharp combinatorial versions of these conditions .",
    "we prove ( lemma  [ mainlemma ] ) that the conditions hold for @xmath24 if @xmath6 has parallel edges in @xmath2 , and describe one class of examples in which the conditions do not ( both ) hold . in   [ generals ] we discuss a formula for the csm class of a transversal intersection , needed for the application to graph hypersurfaces presented here ; this section can be read independently of the rest of the paper . in",
    " [ particulars ] we apply these formulas to the case of graph hypersurfaces , obtaining the deletion - contraction relation ( theorem  [ delconthm ] ) . in   [ multedges ] we apply this relation to obtain multiple - edge formulas as mentioned above ( theorem  [ goodform ] , lemma  [ recurs ] ) . in   [ speci ] we describe a different and more ` geometric ' ( but in practice less applicable ) approach to the main deletion - contraction formula , using _ verdier s specialization .",

    "_ i thank matilde marcolli for stimulating my interest in graph hypersurfaces through our previous joint work , and for the hospitality at caltech , where this paper was written .",

    "we work over an algebraically closed field @xmath30 of characteristic  zero .",
    "[ [ condintro ] ]    as in  [ intro ] , @xmath2 denotes a finite graph , with @xmath13 edges ; we allow looping edges as well as parallel edges .",

    "we present in this section two conditions for a pair @xmath27 , where @xmath6 is an edge of @xmath2 , encoding some geometric features of @xmath32 .",
    "finding more transparent , combinatorial versions of these conditions is an interesting problem .",
    "we will say that an edge @xmath6 of @xmath2 is _ regular _ if @xmath6 is neither a bridge nor a looping edge , and further @xmath16 is not a forest .",
    "we will essentially always assume that @xmath6 is regular on @xmath2 ; non - regular edges are easy to treat separately ( see e.g. ,  [ trivca ] ) .",

    "we denote by @xmath38 the blow - up of @xmath32 at  @xmath36 , and by @xmath39 the exceptional divisor of this blow - up .",

    "the condition essentially ( that is , up to saturating @xmath46 ) amounts to requiring @xmath47 to be a subscheme of @xmath43 .",
    "it is of course easy to verify whether this condition holds on any given graph , by employing a symbolic manipulation package such as macaulay2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the following examples illustrate a few cases , showing in particular that the condition depends on global features of the graph .",

    "however , we can provide one combinatorial situation in which both conditions are satisfied , and this situation is at the root of the application to multiple - edge formulas in  [ multedges ] .",

    "[ [ fami ] ]    in this section we explain briefly a different approach to the question studied in this paper , based on the theory of specialization of chern classes ; this theory is originally due to verdier ( @xcite ) . for simplicity",
    ", we now work over @xmath331 .",
    "let @xmath332 be a family of hypersurfaces over a disk ; assume that the fibers over @xmath333 are all isomorphic . under suitable ( and mild ) hypotheses , one may define a specific constructible function @xmath334 on the central fiber @xmath335 , with the property that @xmath336 equals the specialization ( in the sense of intersection theory ) of the csm class of the general fiber .",
    "the value @xmath337 at a point @xmath338 equals the euler characteristic of the intersection of the @xmath339-ball centered at @xmath36 with nearby fibers @xmath340 , as @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "see @xcite , proposition  4.1 . it may also be computed in terms of an embedded resolution of @xmath9 , see  @xcite .    in the situation we will consider here ,",
    "the hypersurfaces @xmath340 will be elements of a pencil in projective space .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath343 if @xmath9 is nonsingular at @xmath36 , and @xmath344 if @xmath36 is a point of transversal intersection of two nonsingular components of @xmath9 , provided that @xmath36 does not belong to the base locus of the pencil .",
    "parusiski and pragacz ( @xcite , proposition 5.1 ) prove that @xmath343 if @xmath345 ( @xmath333 ) _ is _ a point of the base locus , if @xmath340 is _ smooth and transversal to the strata of a fixed whitney stratification of @xmath9 _ at @xmath36 .",
    "this beautiful observation will be used below .      returning to graph hypersurfaces ,",
    "recall that if @xmath6 is a regular edge of @xmath2 , then @xmath346 as @xmath16 is not a forest , both @xmath25 and @xmath347 are polynomials of positive degree .",
    "thus , we may view @xmath348 as an element of the pencil spanned by @xmath349 and @xmath347 : @xmath350 in @xmath351 we note that @xmath352 is isomorphic to @xmath353 for @xmath333 : indeed , with @xmath354 , @xmath355 where @xmath356 denotes the variables corresponding to edges other than @xmath6 .",
    "view ( * ) as defining a family as in  [ fami ] , with central fiber @xmath357 .",
    "that is , @xmath358 where @xmath272 number of edges in the graph @xmath2 , @xmath359 is the hyperplane defined by @xmath360 , and @xmath361 denotes the cone over @xmath362 with vertex at the point @xmath363 . as a consequence of verdier s theorem ( thorme  5.1 in @xcite ) , @xmath364 where these classes are taken in @xmath365 , and @xmath334 is the specialization function on @xmath9 defined in  [ fami ] .",
    "the difficulty with this approach lies in the explicit computation of @xmath334 .",
    "again we indicate two conditions under which a result may be obtained , matching the result of the more algebraic approach taken in the rest of the paper .",
    "the first condition is a ` set - theoretic ' version of condition  i : @xmath366 as pointed out in  [ condi ] , condition  i implies this inclusion at the level of schemes ; here , we are only requiring it at the level of sets .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , then the value of @xmath334 may be determined for all points of @xmath367 .",
    "this consists of the complements of @xmath32 in @xmath368 , in @xmath369 , and in @xmath370 .",
    "thus : the first statement holds since @xmath361 is nonsingular at @xmath49 , and @xmath49 does not belong to the base locus of the pencil .",
    "the third statement likewise holds because @xmath49 is not in the base locus , and @xmath377 is nonsingular . in the second statement",
    ", @xmath49 is nonsingular on both @xmath361 and @xmath15 , and these hypersuraces intersect transversally at @xmath36 , so @xmath374 as recalled in ",
    "[ fami ] .    to prove the last assertion",
    ", we have to consider @xmath378 .",
    "( we have already dealt with the other points in @xmath370 . ) at these points , both @xmath9 and @xmath32 are nonsingular ( by condition  i ) .",
    "further , the intersection @xmath379 is also nonsingular at such points , again by condition  i. thus the hypotheses of the result of parusiski and pragacz recalled in   [ fami ] are satisfied , and it follows that @xmath372 .",
    "the locus unaccounted for in lemma  [ condip ] is @xmath380 .",
    "these are points in the base locus which are contained in the component @xmath361 .",
    "_ if _ @xmath32 were nonsingular and transversal to the strata of @xmath361 at these points , then ( according to the formula of parusiski and pragacz ) we would have @xmath372 for @xmath381 ; the deviation of @xmath334 from @xmath79 at such points is a measure of non - transversality of the two hypersurfaces .",
    "also note that this locus equals the cone over @xmath181 with vertex at @xmath36 .",
    "the following condition should again be interpreted as a subtle notion of ` transversality ' of the intersection of the various loci considered here .",
    "@xmath382              applying verdier s theorem and additivity of csm classes , we get @xmath384 recalling @xmath359 , and expressing in terms of polynomial feynman rules , this gives @xmath385 with the stated result . here",
    "we also used the fact that @xmath386 , an easy consequence of proposition  5.2 in @xcite .      in conclusion",
    ", we have verified that the deletion - contraction formula obtained under the ` algebraic ' conditions  i and  ii described in ",
    "[ condis ] also holds under the conditions  i and  ii given in   [ condipstat]-[condiipstat ] .",
    "these latter conditions have a more ` geometric ' flavor : condition  i is a set - theoretic statement , and condition  ii amounts to a statement on the euler characteristics of intersections of an @xmath339-ball with nearby fibers in a fibration naturally associated with the pair @xmath27 .",
    "in this sense they are perhaps easier to appreciate , although in practice the algebraic counterparts i and  ii are more readily verifiable in given cases , by means of tools such as @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to relate these two sets of conditions more precisely : does @xmath27 satisfy i and  ii if and only if it satisfies i and  ii ? do these conditions admit a transparent combinatorial interpretation ?"
