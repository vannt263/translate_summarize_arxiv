    "the cluster 1e  0657@xmath056 at @xmath4 is in many ways exceptional .",
    "it has a high x - ray luminosity @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 , and it is a contender for being the hottest known cluster ( @xmath7kev ; tucker et al .",
    "1998 , liang et al .  2000 ) .",
    "the rosat pspc / hri images show that the cluster has two distinct x - ray subclumps indicating on - going merging activity ( fig .",
    "[ hriradio ] ) . owing to its high x - ray luminosity",
    ", the cluster was chosen for the detection of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect with the swedish eso submillimeter telescope ( sest ; andreani et al .",
    "the sest detection of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in the cluster prompted subsequent attempts to confirm the detection at centimetre wavelengths at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "however , any sunyaev - zeldovich decrement at centimetre wavelengths was masked by the presence of one of the most powerful cluster - wide diffuse radio haloes known ( liang et al .",
    "the radio halo is believed to be of synchrotron emission and has an extent and morphology similar to the x - ray emission .",
    "when searching for possible polarisation in the radio halo , we found an unusual highly polarised discrete source , 0658 , about 2.5 arcmin from the cluster centre .",
    "we discuss the nature of the source in the following sections . in section 2",
    ", we briefly describe the radio properties of the source ; in section 3 , we explore the possibilities of it being galactic or extragalactic ; sections 4 and 5 discuss whether it is inside or behind the cluster ; section 6 gives the results of deep imaging with the vlt , and the conclusions are given in section 7 .    throughout the paper",
    "we will assume @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 .",
    "radio observations centred on the cluster 1e  0657@xmath056 were obtained at the atca using various antenna configurations and observing frequencies .",
    "the observations were aimed initially at the attempted detection of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , subtraction of confusing radio sources and subsequent studies of the radio halo emission .",
    "details of the radio observations are given in liang et al.(2000 ) .",
    "the peculiar radio source 0658 stands out in the polarisation maps with @xmath11% linear polarisation at 8.8ghz .",
    "it is significantly depolarised with @xmath12% polarisation at 1.3ghz .",
    "no circular polarisation was detected , with an upper limit of 0.5% at 1.3ghz .",
    "the source has a steep spectrum , with a spectral index ( defined by @xmath3 ) of @xmath13 , steepening at higher frequencies to reach @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "the properties of the source are summarised in table  [ tb1 ] .",
    "the spectrum and polarisation suggest that the emission is synchrotron .",
    "synchrotron emission is intrinsically highly polarised ( up to @xmath15% ) , but observed polarisations are usually weak due to various depolarisation effects . while a small region ( e.g. part of a jet ) of an extragalactic source",
    "can be highly polarised , so far no extragalactic radio source is known with such a high _ integrated _ linear polarisation ( e.g.  de zotti et al .",
    "1999 ) , and only a few percent of the sources found at high radio frequencies have spectra as steep as 0658 ( e.g.  richards 2000 ) .",
    "radio emission with such high polarisation and such a steep spectrum is normally seen only from pulsars ; in fact , the millisecond pulsars were discovered this way .",
    "a high resolution follow - up observation obtained with the atca in 1997 november using the 6c configuration at 4.8 and 8.8ghz showed that the source was elongated by @xmath16 ( figs  [ hriradio ]  &  [ 3 cm ] ) .",
    "the deconvolved elliptical gaussian size of the source is @xmath17 fwhm at all frequencies from 1.3 to 8.8ghz .",
    "since the source is extended , and by a similar amount at all frequencies , it can not be a pulsar , or even a scattered pulsar .",
    "the agreement in angular size also indicates that there is no significant systematic loss of short - spacing flux at high frequencies , so the steepening of the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ sp ] is real .",
    "if faraday rotation is caused by the external media between the source and the observer , then the position angle of the electric vector ( @xmath18 ) is related to wavelength ( @xmath19 ) by @xmath20 where rm is the rotation measure .",
    "the position angle versus @xmath21 relation is well fitted by a straight line to five frequencies spanning the range 2.28.9 ghz . between 4.8 and 8.8ghz , at a resolution of @xmath22 , we obtain an average rotation measure of @xmath23radm@xmath24 across the source .",
    "figure  [ 3 cm ] shows the rotation measure across the source in greyscale . for comparison , the galactic rotation measure in the direction of the source",
    "is @xmath25radm@xmath24 ( simard - normandin et al . 1981 ) , or @xmath26radm@xmath24 ( j.  han , private communication ) .",
    "hence , the rotation measure in 0658 is unlikely to be galactic in origin , and this , together with the absence of a clear optical counterpart ( see section 6 ) , argues that the source must be extragalactic .",

    "there is no obvious optical identification for 0658 , but the bright elliptical galaxy @xmath34 to the east ( galaxy a in fig .",
    "[ vlt ] ) was confirmed as a cluster member ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "if the source is in the cluster then the lack of any optical identification with cluster galaxies suggests that it may possibly be a radio relic @xmath36kpc in extent .",
    "diffuse radio relics of the type seen in a3667 and a2256 are known to be polarised with very steep spectra , though without significant depolarisation .",
    "for instance , the relics ( g and h ) in a2256 are polarised at a @xmath37% level at 1.4ghz ( rttgering et al .",
    "however , these relics are much larger in spatial extent ( @xmath38mpc ) and more diffuse than 0658 .",
    "the source appears to be embedded in the outer parts of the radio halo , with its long axis approximately tangential to the x - ray contours .",
    "it is conceivable that 0658 is just an enhanced part of the radio halo where the local magnetic field is strong and well organised , as in the case of a shock seen in the plane of compression .",
    "figure  [ 3 cm ] shows that the magnetic field vectors are well aligned with the direction of the source elongation over at least the southern half of the source .",
    "the surface brightness of 0658 is roughly 100 times that of the halo , so the magnetic field in the source would need to be at least 10 times greater than the large scale cluster field , which is still reasonable .",
    "we have also searched in the near infrared in case the optical emission is obscured by dust , or the object is at a redshift such that most of the optical emission above the 4000   break has been shifted into the infrared .",
    "we observed the field for 4.5 hrs on 1999 november 23 with the infrared camera caspir on the anu 2.3 m telescope at siding spring observatory .",
    "no infrared counterpart was found to a limiting magnitude of h @xmath39 .",
    "if the source is behind the cluster , then it may be a radio galaxy at high redshift .",
    "the alignment of the magnetic field with the elongation of the source is consistent with that of large - scale jets .",
    "the depolarisation and slight flattening of the spectrum near the position of the possible optical counterpart ( fig .",
    "[ hriradio ] ) may also be consistent with a core - jet structure in which the core is often depolarised with a flatter spectrum .",
    "high - redshift radio galaxies are known to have steep spectral indices ( @xmath40 ) . however , in a polarisation study of a sample of high redshift radio galaxies , carilli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found a maximum integrated polarisation of @xmath39% at 8.2ghz .",
    "hence , if this source is a high redshift radio galaxy , it is exceptional in terms of its polarisation properties .",
    "alternatively , 0658 could also be the gravitationally lensed part of a background jet since small parts of a jet can sometimes be highly polarised and the more polarised parts tend to have a steeper spectrum .",
    "if it is just part of the jet , then we do not expect to find an optical identification at the position of the radio emission .",
    "the cluster 1e0657@xmath056 is one of the most massive clusters known ; it can act as an effective gravitational lens . to produce the orientation of the source , it is necessary to have another lens to the other side of the source . the elliptical cluster galaxy ( a ) to the east of the source",
    "could act as such a counterweight .",
    "vlt images of the field of 0658 were obtained by mehlert et al.(private communication ) with ut1 in the b , g , r and i bands during the fors1 commissioning in december 1998 .",
    "exposure times were 10 minutes and the measured seeing was @xmath41 fwhm .",
    "these images revealed a faint possible identification ( b ) , embedded in the halo of the galaxy ( a ) to the east of the source ( fig .",
    "[ vlt ] ) , at 06 58 42.04 , @xmath055 58 35.8 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the astrometric transfer to the deep vlt images was done using the publicly available supercosmos scans of the red ( iiiaf ) sky survey plate of field 162 from the uk / aao schmidt telescope . the formal fit error on this plate",
    "is given as @xmath42 rms in each coordinate .",
    "the accuracy of radio - optical registration was confirmed to be @xmath43 by overlaying the full resolution atca 3 cm images of two tailed cluster source in 1e 0657@xmath056 on the vlt image .",
    "the displacement of galaxy b from the axis and centroid of the radio emission ( @xmath44 ) is real , and therefore casts doubt on any possible association .    to estimate fluxes in the vlt b , g , r and i bands",
    ", we extracted a patch @xmath45 ( @xmath46 pixels ) centred on the nearby elliptical galaxy ( a ) , and fitted a photometric model to the galaxy ( a ) and to eight compact sources embedded in the extended galaxy profile , including galaxy b. we selected an isolated , bright but unsaturated , star from each image to define the point - spread function ( psf ) , and utilised the imfit package , written by b.  mcleod , which has been used to determine photometric models for lensed systems in the castles project ( see , e.g. , lehr et al .",
    "we used magnitude zero points kindly provided by s.  seitz .",
    "the quality of the fits was high , yielding estimated uncertainties of @xmath47 mag .",
    "apparent magnitudes of galaxy b thus measured in b , g , r and i bands are listed in table  [ tb2 ] along with the upper limit in h band .",
    "the steepness of the radio spectrum suggests that 0658 is unlikely to be a quasar or a seyfert galaxy .",
    "radio galaxies are identified with giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "it has been shown by scarpa & urry ( 2000 ) that there is no fundamental difference between the optical properties of radio and non - radio emitting elliptical galaxies except that the probability of an elliptical galaxy hosting a radio source is proportional to the square of its optical luminosity .",
    "assuming that galaxy b is an elliptical , we found a solution for the photometric redshift , @xmath48 , using the public domain photometric redshift program hyperz ( bolzonela et al .",
    "a synthetic spectral energy distribution ( sed ) corresponding to an elliptical galaxy ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) was fitted to the broad band magnitudes taking into account the dust absorption through the galaxy itself using the reddening law of calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and the continuum absorption by the lyman forest using estimates for lyman-@xmath49 and lyman-@xmath50 line blanketing by madau ( 1995 ) and zero flux throughput below the lyman limit .",
    "the sed fit to the observed broad band flux is given in fig .",
    "[ sed ] . at @xmath51 ,",
    "the source would have @xmath52 and @xmath53whz@xmath6 , typical of a classical fr ii radio galaxy .",
    "finally , we examine the significance of galaxy b being within the radio contours of 0658 . in the small @xmath45 patch",
    "centred on galaxy a , we found 10 faint objects in the b - band image with magnitudes similar to galaxy b. hence the probability of finding an object like galaxy b within the second radio contour ( @xmath54 ) by chance is @xmath55% which shows that the coincidence is not of high significance .",
    "we also note that there are two arc - like features , one long straight arc to the south and another arc to the north - west of galaxy a , a confirmed cluster member .",
    "the long arc is seen in the r - band ( ` arc2 ' in fig .",
    "[ vlt ] ) as well as the i - band image and it is most likely to be a gravitational arc .",
    "the other arc is most prominent in the b - band image ( ` arc ' in fig .",
    "[ vlt ] ) .",
    "it could be a gravitational arc or a tidal feature as a result of merging .",
    "if it is a gravitational arc , then it makes the lensing scenario given at the end of sec .",
    "5 more plausible since the radio contour would then be traversing the caustics .",
    "if it is a merging signature , then it lends support to the presence of shocks and hence the cluster relic scenario ( sec .",

    "we have found an unusual extended radio source with a steep radio spectrum and extreme integrated linear polarisation ( table  [ tb1 ] ) . after eliminating the likelihood that the source is galactic , we have considered three possible explanations for these unusual properties :    * gravitational lens + 0658 is the lensed fragment of a jet belonging to a distant radio galaxy .",
    "this would explain the high polarisation since small regions of radio galaxies are known to have high polarisation . the proximity of the bright elliptical ( a ) , the presence of the rich cluster and the arcs in the immediate surroundings lend support to this scenario .",
    "* @xmath58 radio galaxy with no lensing + the optical identification ( galaxy b ) is offset from the radio central axis , and the probability of a chance coincidence of galaxy b falling within the radio contours of 0658 is high .",
