    "measurements of the production cross section of heavy flavor quarks ( @xmath2 and @xmath1 quarks ) in the @xmath3 collisions provide us an opportunity to test the prediction based on the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "no only is qcd one of the four fundamental forces of the nature , but also many searches of new physics beyond standard model require a good understanding of the qcd background .",
    "the bottom quark production cross section has been measured by both the cdf and 0 experiments  @xcite at the fermilab tevatron in @xmath3 collision at @xmath4 , and found to be about three times larger than the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculation  @xcite . since then , several theoretical explanation has been proposed to solve the disagreement , such as the large contributions from the nnlo qcd processes , possible contribution from `` new physics ''  @xcite etc . recently , a more accurate description of @xmath1 quark fragmentation has reduced the discrepancy to a factor 1.7  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , further experimental measurements on the heavy flavor production are essential to shed light on the remaining clouds of this long standing issue .    since the end of runi ( 1996 ) , the tevatron had underdone major upgrade .",
    "the center of mass energy in the @xmath3 collision was increased from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "the large luminosity enhancement dramatically increases the discovery reach and moves the experimental program into a regime of precision hadron collider physics . at the same time , both cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite experimental collaborations significantly upgraded their detectors to enrich the physics capabilities , especially for the heavy flavor physics program .",
    "the tevatron runii data taking period started in april 2002 , so far the accelerator has delivered about @xmath6 integrated luminosities , both experiments collected more than @xmath7 physics quality data . in this paper , we will give a brief summary of the latest results on heavy flavor production from tevatron runii .",
    "in order to help understanding the discrepancy between measured runi bottom quark cross section measurement and theoretical calculation , one can repeat previous measurement with better control of experimental uncertainties .",
    "an alternative approach is to examine the production rate of another heavy quark .",
    "charm meson production cross  sections have not been measured in @xmath3 collisions and may help to solve this disagreement . for cdfii upgrade ,",
    "one of the crucial improvement with respect to the cdfi is the implementation of a silicon vertex trigger ( svt )  @xcite , which allows us to trigger on displaced tracks decayed from long - lived charm and bottom hadrons . with this trigger ,",
    "large amount of fully reconstructed charm meson has been collected , opening a new window for heavy flavor production studies at hadron collider .    using just @xmath8 data , cdf performs a measurement of prompt charm meson production cross section  @xcite .",
    "the charm mesons are reconstructed in the following decay modes : , with , , with , and their charge conjugate , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] .",
    "we separate charm directly produced in @xmath3 interaction ( prompt charm ) from charm decayed from @xmath9 mesons ( secondary charm ) using the impact parameter of the charm candidate with respect to the primary interaction point .",
    "prompt charm meson points to the beamline and its impact parameter is zero .",
    "the secondary charm meson candidate does not necessarily point back to the primary vertex , it has a rather wide impact parameter distribution .",
    "the shape of the impact parameter distribution of secondary charm is obtained from a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the detector impact parameter resolution is modeled from a sample of @xmath10 decays that satisfy the same trigger requirement .",
    "the prompt charm fraction is measured as a function of charm meson @xmath11 .",
    "average over all @xmath11 bins , @xmath12 of the @xmath13 mesons , @xmath14 of @xmath15 , @xmath16 of @xmath17 , and @xmath18 of @xmath19 are promptly produced ( statistical uncertainties only ) .",
    "the measured prompt charm meson integrated cross section are found to be @xmath20b , @xmath21b , @xmath22b and @xmath23b , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic . the measured differential cross sections are compared to two recent calculations  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dx ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dx_ratio ] .",
    "they are higher than the theoretical predictions by about 100% at low @xmath11 and 50% at high @xmath11 .",
    "however , they are compatible within uncertainties .",
    "the same models also underestimate @xmath9 meson production at @xmath24tev by similar factors  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : dx ]",
    "the cdfii detector has improved the dimuon trigger system with a lower threshold of @xmath25 .",
    "this allows us to trigger the @xmath26 event with transverse momentum all the way down to @xmath27 . using about @xmath28 data , cdf reconstructed @xmath29 @xmath0 candidates ( statistical uncertainty only ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal_jpsi ] . a new measurement of the total inclusive @xmath0 cross section in the central rapidity region",
    "@xmath30 has been carried out .",
    "this is the first measurement of the total inclusive @xmath0 cross section in the central rapidity region at a hadron collider .",
    "the differential cross section is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec_jpsi ] , and the integrated cross section is measured to be : @xmath31    taking advantage of the large azimuth coverage of its muon system , the 0 measured the differential cross section of the inclusive @xmath0 as a function of the rapidity using @xmath32 .",
    "the distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec_jpsi_d0 ] .",
    "[ fig : xsec_jpsi_d0 ]",
    "the runi central @xmath1-quark production cross section measured by cdf and 0 has a minimum transverse momentum cut on the @xmath1-hadrons due to the trigger requirements .",
    "since those measurements only explore a small fraction ( @xmath33 ) of the @xmath1-hadron @xmath11 spectrum , it is not clear from the data whether the excess over the theory is due to an overall discrepancy of the @xmath34 production rate , or it is caused by a shift in the spectrum toward higher @xmath11 .",
    "an inclusive measurement of bottom quark production over all transverse momentum can certainly help resolve this ambiguity .",
    "notice that large fraction of @xmath1-hadron @xmath35 decays to @xmath0 final states , where @xmath35 denotes both hadron and anti - hadron .",
    "cdf performed an analysis to extract the inclusive @xmath1-hadron cross section from the measured inclusive @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "due to the long live lifetime of the @xmath1-hadrons , the vertex of the @xmath0 decayed from a @xmath1-hadron ( secondary @xmath0 ) is usually hundreds microns away from the primary vertex , while for the prompt @xmath0 s , which are directly produced or decayed from higher charmonium states , their vertex are at the proton - antiproton interaction point . as the result , we can statistically separate these two components by examining the projected @xmath0 decay distance along its transverse momentum . the measured @xmath1-fraction",
    "is then applied to the previously measured inclusive @xmath0 cross section to obtain the differential production cross section of @xmath36 as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "however , the above algorithm to extract @xmath1-fraction does not work for @xmath0 candidate with low transverse momentum , because a @xmath1-hadron with low @xmath11 does not travel far away from the primary vertex in the transverse plane .",
    "therefore a minimum @xmath38 requirement is imposed for the @xmath1-hadron cross section measurement as a function of @xmath37 in order to have a reliable determination of @xmath1-fraction .",
    "the measured differential cross section result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec_b_jpsi ] .",
    "luckily , the @xmath1-hadron decayed at rest can still transfer a few ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40 transverse momentum to its @xmath0 daughter because of the large @xmath1-hadron mass .",
    "the knowledge of the secondary @xmath0 production with transverse momenta less than @xmath41 allows us to probe the @xmath1-hadrons with low transverse momenta down to zero . therefore using the measured @xmath1-hadron differential cross section with @xmath42",
    ", we are able to extract the @xmath1-hadron differential cross section as a function of @xmath43 down to @xmath44 .",
    "to do so , we perform a convolution that is based on the monte carlo template of the @xmath1-hadron transverse momentum distribution .",
    "the unfolding procedure is then repeated using the measured @xmath1-hadron production spectrum as the input spectrum for the next iteration , until the @xmath45 comparison between the input and output spectrum calculated after each iteration becomes stable .",
    "the measured @xmath1-hadron cross section as a function of @xmath43 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec_b ] .",
    "the total @xmath1-hadron cross section is found to be @xmath46 the total single @xmath1-quark cross section is obtained by divided this measurement by two , the branching fractions , and the rapidity correction factors obtained from mc .",
    "we find : @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "using @xmath49 of data , a @xmath1-jet production cross section analysis has been performed by 0 .",
    "the candidate event is selected by associating a muon track with a jet , which is defined with @xmath50 cone algorithm .",
    "notice the fact that the muon decayed from @xmath1 quark has a higher transverse momentum with respect to the net momentum vector of combined muon and jet , the corresponding distribution is then used to fit the b - jet fraction .",
    "the signal template is modeled from a @xmath51 monte carlo simulation , and the background template is extracted from 1.5 million qcd events . after correcting the muon and jet reconstruction efficiency , and the calorimeter jet energy resolution , the @xmath1-jet cross section is obtained .",
    "the preliminary result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bjetcross ] compared to the theoretical prediction .",
    "this measurement is consistent with the previous runi measurement  @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the heavy flavor production is currently one of the most important challenges faced by qcd . in this paper , we present the most recent measurements from cdf and 0 experiments . given large amount of data that have already been collected , rapid improvement of tevatron performance , and further understanding of the detector , we expect that much more precise measurements on the heavy flavor production will be available in the near future . at the same time",
    ", several other analyses have also been carried out to explore other aspects of heavy flavor production mechanism , such as the @xmath34 correlation and @xmath52 correlation during the production . in the next a few years , a combination of better experimental data and improved theory should advance our knowledges of the heavy quarks production ."
