    "this paper describes a technique to measure the radial velocities of faint secondaries residing in known single - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb1s ) using high - resolution infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy .",
    "the paper outlines the approach and reports on the detection of low - mass secondaries in three main - sequence binaries . from the radial velocities of the faint secondaries , combined with the",
    "already known velocities of the primaries , we derive the mass ratios of these binaries , and estimate the masses of the secondaries .    in most of the known spectroscopic binaries only the primary spectrum is detected and measured , rendering such systems as sb1s .",
    "measurements of sb1s yield only the mass function , in which the mass of the primary , secondary , and inclination ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) are inseparable . to derive the mass ratios of these systems",
    "it is necessary to turn them into double - lined binaries ( sb2s ) . to obtain the masses we further need to obtain information about the inclination , either from the light curves in eclipsing binaries , or from astrometric orbits . when the inclination of an sb2 is not known , it is possible to derive the secondary mass if the primary mass can be estimated from the system s photometry and spectrum .",
    "accurate mass ratios and masses are important for many aspects of the astrophysics of binaries .",
    "we are applying the technique we describe here in two areas of particular interest to us .",
    "accurate masses for pre@xmath7main - sequence ( pms ) stars with low masses ( m@xmath81 m@xmath9 ) are known for only very few objects . as a result ,",
    "calculations of pms evolution are incompletely tested .",
    "comparison of evolutionary tracks published in the past 5 years show that , for a given location of a star in the hr diagram , the different tracks can produce a scatter of 2@xmath73 in the inferred mass and age @xcite .",
    "one of our goals is , therefore , to improve the calibration of the theoretical tracks by deriving the mass ratios , and , eventually , the masses of the low - mass components of pms binaries .",
    "another of our goals is to derive the distribution of mass ratios and secondary masses in main - sequence binaries .",
    "the secondary - mass distribution touches upon one of the unanswered basic questions of star formation , namely how binaries , and close binaries in particular , are formed",
    ". the secondary distribution provides one way to distinguish @xcite between the star formation models ( e.g. clark 1995 ; bate 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , the lower end of the secondary mass distribution is of crucial importance to an issue that has attracted recent attention : the distinction between low - mass secondaries and extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "some recent studies @xcite suggested that the two populations could be separated by comparing their mass distributions .",
    "spectroscopic binaries have been studied mostly in the visible , where sensitive detectors have been available for a few decades .",
    "unfortunately , detection of secondaries in visual spectra favors systems with light ratio , and hence mass ratio , close to unity .",
    "most of the known spectroscopic binaries are thus sb1s and the distribution of mass ratios in the known double - lined systems ( sb2s ) is biased toward unity .",
    "our approach is based on the premise that in each binary the secondary has a lower mass and is therefore cooler than the primary , favoring its detection in the ir .",
    "consider , for example , a binary with 0.2 and 1.0 m@xmath9 stars at the age of 5 gyr .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite indicate that the flux ratio between the primary and the secondary is about @xmath10 at 5500  , but only 0.01 at 1.6  @xmath11 m .",
    "thus , the advent of high - resolution ir spectrometers with efficient large format detectors offers the means to complement the visible radial - velocity studies with ir observations that are considerably more sensitive to low - mass companions .",
    "this enables the measurement of the secondary radial velocities which convert the sb1s into sb2s .",
    "the derivation of mass ratios by this approach does not require extensive observations since the parameters of the primary orbit have already been derived from previous work so only a small number of secondary velocities are required .    to analyze the composite target spectra we use todcor , a two - dimensional correlation algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "the algorithm assumes that the observed spectrum is a combination of two known spectra , shifted by the radial velocities of the two components , and calculates the correlation of the observed spectrum against a combination of two templates with different shifts .",
    "todcor generates a two - dimensional correlation function , whose peak simultaneously identifies the radial velocities of both the primary and the secondary ( e.g. zucker & mazeh 1994 ) .",
    "one of the advantages of todcor is its ability to use different templates for the primary and the secondary .",
    "when the primary and the secondary are of different spectral types , the use of two different templates enables us to utilize all the spectral information contained in the observed spectrum of the combined system .",
    "this feature of todcor is most important when deriving the radial velocity of a faint secondary .",
    "this paper outlines the new approach and reports on the detection of low - mass secondaries in three main - sequence binaries : g  147 - 36 , g  164 - 67 , and hd  144284 .",
    "the former two systems were identified and studied as sb1s by @xcite , who searched for spectroscopic binaries within a sample of high - proper - motion stars @xcite .",
    "the latter was found by @xcite , who studied the nearby g stars .",
    "the three stars presented here were the three most significant detections in our main - sequence program to date .",
    "preliminary reports on the application of this technique to main - sequence and pms sbs appear in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "section 2 presents four approaches to the derivation of mass ratios from the primary and secondary radial velocities .",
    "our observations are described in section 3 and the spectral type templates in section  4 .",
    "we present our derivation of the radial velocities in section 5 , while section  6 shows the calculation of the mass ratios for the three binaries .",
    "a short discussion of our results appears in section  7 .",
    "in this section we present four different approaches to derive the mass ratio @xmath12 of a spectroscopic binary from a few radial velocities of both the primary and the secondary .",
    "choosing between these approaches depends upon the extent of the information available from the previous sb1 solution .    1 .",
    "when no previous orbital information is available , any two _ pairs _ of velocities can yield the mass ratio of a binary ( wilson 1941 ) .",
    "suppose we have observed the system at two epochs , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with velocities @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the velocities of the primary and the secondary , respectively .",
    "then the mass ratio is + @xmath17 + the ratio of the velocity _ difference _ between the i - th and the j - th observations is exactly @xmath18 .",
    "this approach will be most effective with measurements made at such phases that the difference of the velocities is large compared to the uncertainty of their measurements . when more than two pairs of velocities are available , any two pairs of velocities can yield another value of the mass ratio .",
    "note , however , that not _ all _ the @xmath18 values are independent ( see also wilson 1941 ) .",
    "2 .   when the systemic velocity , @xmath19 , is available from the sb1 observations , each pair of velocities , obtained at time @xmath13 , can yield a value of the mass ratio + @xmath20 3 .",
    "when the elements of the single - lined orbit are available , the expected primary velocity @xmath21 at the time of the observation @xmath13 can be derived from the elements .",
    "in such a case , each secondary velocity @xmath22 can yield a value of the mass ratio + @xmath23 + in the case in which the zero point of the new velocities is uncertain , _ and _ the primary velocity was also measured , @xmath22 can be replaced by @xmath24 .",
    "this assumes that the new primary and secondary velocities share the same zero point .",
    "4 .   in the case",
    "in which the original single - lined radial velocity measurements are available , one can combine the old velocities with the new double - lined measurements and obtain a new solution for the orbital elements .",
    "the new set of elements includes @xmath25 , the semi - amplitude of the secondary , from which one can derive the mass ratio .",
    "the three binaries considered here have known elements together with the individual measurements @xcite .",
    "we therefore opted to apply the second and the last approaches listed above .",
    "the advantage of the second approach is that the spread of the mass ratio values can be examined and evaluated directly , while in the last option this is all hidden in the orbital solution .",
    "to search for the spectroscopic signature of the secondaries in our sb1 sample , we observed the target systems and standard stars in 1997 december and 1999 february , may , and november with cshell on the irtf 3-m and in 1999 december with phoenix at the kpno 4-m .",
    "cshell is a high resolution ir spectrometer equipped with a @xmath26 insb array that provided a free spectral range of @xmath27 km / s .",
    "we observed with a @xmath28 slit , yielding a measured resolution of @xmath29 .",
    "phoenix , noao s high resolution ir spectrometer , has a @xmath30 insb array which provides a @xmath31 km / s free spectral range . with phoenix",
    ", we used a @xmath32 slit which gave a measured resolution of @xmath33 .",
    "the spectrometers were centered at @xmath34 m for all of our observations .",
    "inspection of atlases of solar photospheric and sunspot spectra showed that this region contains lines suitable for the characterization of stars in the mass range of interest .",
    "the region includes atomic lines for identifying the g and early k spectral type stars and molecular lines , most notably oh and h@xmath35o , suitable for late k and m spectral type stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "1998 for an overview of stellar spectra in the @xmath0 band ) .",
    "this wavelength region is also advantageously free of strong terrestrial absorption lines .",
    "we calculated the dispersion and wavelength calibration of cshell and phoenix at the @xmath34 m setting using spectral lamps internal to the instruments .",
    "both spectrometers showed small flexure , at the level of @xmath36 km / s during a night of observations .",
    "we corrected for the flexure by reobserving the lamps during the night and also by monitoring the apparent positions of the oh lines detected from the night sky .",
    "the spectra were extracted by procedures written by one of us @xcite .",
    "in addition to the target spectra , we also observed a sample of main - sequence standard stars , from spectral type f8 through m6.5 , in order to provide templates for the two - dimensional cross - correlation analysis using todcor . when possible , we chose a standard whose metallicity would be close to solar , on the expectation that its lines would be deeper than those of older stars .",
    "the templates are usually slow rotators , and if needed we generated new calculated templates by broadening the template lines with profiles representing different rotational velocities ( see below ) .",
    "we also expected that these standards would provide better templates for our pms star program .",
    "table  1 lists the observed standards .",
    "the third column provides an estimate of their population type .",
    "a numerical entry in this column represents the value of [ fe / h ] from the catalog of @xcite . in cases where the catalog listed several determinations",
    ", we used the most recent one . a dagger ( @xmath37 ) in this column is @xcite s designator for stars they judged to have the best determination of spectral type .",
    "od and yd are leggett s ( 1992 ) `` old disk '' and `` young disk '' designations , based on kinematic and photometric criteria .",
    "column 4 lists the assigned radial velocities of the observed spectra ( see below ) .",
    "column 5 indicates the instrument used , cshell ( c ) or phoenix ( p ) , on the date indicated in column 6 .",
    "figure  1 shows all the template spectra measured with the phoenix spectrometer .",
    "the spectra are shifted to the laboratory frame .",
    "some of the prominent lines are indicated following the identifications given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the todcor analysis correlates spectra of the templates and targets , only the presence of lines matters ; their specific identification is unimportant .",
    "the sawtooth pattern evident in the spectrum of hr  1543 is an artifact of the illumination of the array for that particular observation .",
    "as table  1 indicates , we observed a similar range of spectral types , and often the same stars , with cshell and phoenix . in figure 2 , we show the cshell and phoenix observations for the m stars only .",
    "comparison shows that most of the features in the complex spectra of the late m types , which appear to be noise , are in fact real .",
    "the radial velocities of the observed spectra of the standards are crucial for our analysis . as a starting point",
    ", we assigned to each spectrum the radial velocities of these template stars measured either by the geneva @xcite or by the cfa groups @xcite .",
    "however , not all our templates were observed by these two groups . moreover ,",
    "some of the observed spectra of the templates were shifted by about 12 km / s , apparently the result of random jitter of the spectrographs . to overcome these two difficulties we performed a few iterations to rederive new assigned velocities for each of the observed template spectra .",
    "this was done by correlating each observed spectrum with templates of similar classes , using the assigned velocities of the previous iteration .",
    "a few iterations led us to assign a velocity for each observed spectrum as given in table  1 .",
    "the assigned velocities are _ not _ meant to measure the actual radial velocities of these stars .",
    "they are our best estimates for the radial velocity shifts of the observed spectra , and therefore these are the values we used in our analysis with todcor . in an ideal world , without any outliers and spectrograph jitters , these velocities would be our best estimate for the actual stellar radial velocities .",
    "actually , we find that for most of the stars for which we had a prior radial velocity measurement @xcite , our assigned radial velocity was within 1@xmath72 km / s of the previous measurement .",
    "we therefore estimate that our zero - point is good to within 1.5 km / s .",
    "only one star , gj 475 , displayed a discrepancy of 6 km / s between the cshell ( 8.0 km / s ) and phoenix ( 1.9 km / s ) measurements .",
    "@xcite derived a velocity of @xmath38 km / s .",
    "we , nevertheless , used the two spectra with the assigned velocities , assuming some non - random mechanical or optical shift of 4.5 km / s of the phoenix instrument had occurred during that exposure .",

    "the work presented here demonstrates the potential of ir spectroscopy for detecting faint low - mass secondaries in single - lined spectroscopic binaries and deriving their mass ratios .",
    "we have shown that with the cshell and the phoenix spectrographs we can reach a mass ratio of @xmath42 . to date , this is among the smallest known mass ratios for a main - sequence spectroscopic binary .",
    "@xcite , observing in the red part of the visual spectrum , derived mass ratios of @xmath43 and @xmath44 for two binaries .",
    "the detection of a secondary spectrum and the derivation of its radial velocity is hindered by the presence of the bright primary in the combined spectrum . for our purposes , the bright spectrum of the primary is a strong background source that has to be removed from the combined spectrum before we can measure the secondary radial velocity .",
    "the subtraction of the primary leaves behind noise , which ideally would be determined by poisson statistics , but in reality is determined by the imperfect match between the primary spectrum and its template . to reach the faint stellar secondaries",
    ", we have to exploit every possible advantage available to improve the snr of the secondary spectrum .",
    "in this work we have used two such advantages .",
    "we observed the binaries in the ir regime , where the light ratio of the primary / secondary is much smaller than in the visual , and we used the two - dimensional cross - correlation analysis of todcor to extract the maximum amount of spectral information from the observed spectrum . to improve on this further",
