    "in recent developments of non - perturbative string theory , the existence of many kinds of extended bps objects has been realized .",
    "these bps states are related to each other by several duality transformations , which are believed to be the true symmetries of the non - perturbative string theory . by studying a supersymmetric gauge theory as an effective field theory on an appropriate brane configuration ,",
    "the existence of some string theory bps states on the brane configuration implies the existence of the corresponding bps states in the field theory . thus showing explicitly the existence of such corresponding bps states by using traditional field theory techniques would be a good test to the non - perturbative implications of string theory and",
    "would deepen the understanding of the field theory itself .",
    "a typical example of such interplay is given by the 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath1 @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory broken spontaneously to @xmath4 .",
    "this theory can be studied as an effective field theory on @xmath3 parallel d3-branes @xcite .",
    "the invariance of d3-branes under the @xmath5 duality transformation of type iib string theory implies the @xmath5 duality symmetry of the @xmath1 sym theory @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 strings stretching between different d3-branes preserve 1/2 supersymmetry of the d3-brane world volume and appear as the massive w - bosons of the broken gauge symmetries in the field theory .",
    "the @xmath5 duality symmetry implies the existence of other bps states of the field theory corresponding to the general @xmath7 strings with relatively prime integers @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the states with @xmath10 are monopoles and dyons , the field configurations of which are explicitly known in the form of the prasad - sommerfield solution @xcite .",
    "the existence of the states with @xmath11 was shown by the quantization of the collective modes of the two monopole solutions @xcite , while the existence of the states with @xmath12 was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the bps objects we discuss in this paper are multi - pronged strings in type iib string theory and their counterparts in @xmath1 sym theory .",
    "it was conjectured originally in @xcite that a three - pronged string would exist as a stable state under both the conditions that the forces from the three strings should balance and that the two - from charges of the three strings should conserve at the junction .",
    "the bps feature of such a junction has been shown by several authors in both the string picture @xcite and the m - theory picture @xcite .",
    "the relations to the field theory bps states have been investigated in several contexts @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a three - pronged string connecting different parallel d3-branes was investigated .",
    "this configuration preserves the 1/4 of the d3-brane world volume supersymmetry , and hence it is expected that there exist corresponding 1/4 bps states in the @xmath1 @xmath2 sym theory with @xmath13 .",
    "the author of @xcite obtained an evidence for the existence , showing that the mass of the three - pronged string agrees with the mass of the corresponding field theory state under the assumption of its bps saturation .",
    "but there the configuration itself in the field theory was not obtained .",
    "such a 1/4 bps state was shown to have non - parallel electric and magnetic charges @xcite , and this fact makes it a non - trivial issue to solve the equations of bps saturation .    in our previous work @xcite , we constructed explicitly the corresponding bps states in the @xmath1 @xmath0 sym theory .",
    "we solved explicitly the bogomolnyi equations in the case of non - parallel electric and magnetic charges .",
    "we also obtained exact solutions in the case some of the free parameters are fixed to certain values .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of our solutions agrees with the string picture , that is , three straight strings meet at one point and the forces balance at the junction . on the other hand , we pointed out that there are some differences in our solutions from the string picture , and the behavior of our solutions near the junction does not seem to respect the @xmath5 duality symmetry .",
    "this fact may be interpreted as our technical preference that we treat the sym theory classically , i.e. electrically .    in this paper",
    ", we continue our investigations of string junctions from field theoretical viewpoints , and extend our analysis to multi - pronged strings .",
    "the main part of this paper consists of the explicit construction of the 1/4 bps states in @xmath1 @xmath2 sym theory @xmath14 .",
    "we solve the bogomolnyi equations under the assumption of spherical symmetry in the d3-brane world volume .",
    "the bps solutions we obtain correspond to the string theory bps states of an @xmath3-pronged string connecting @xmath3 different d3-branes .",
    "such multi - pronged strings have been recently studied in the string picture in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : su(n ) ] , we explain our strategy to solve the bogomolnyi equations .",
    "we investigate some properties of our solutions , and give exact solutions in the case some of the free parameters of the general solutions take certain values . in section [ sec : su(4 ) ] , we show in detail the features of our exact solutions for @xmath15 and @xmath16 as examples .",
    "various interesting properties of the solutions are also discussed there . in section [ sec : force ] , we calculate the long - range force between two dyons in the sym theory , and find the consistency with the idea that a three - pronged string can be produced as a bound state of two strings .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] contains summary and discussions . in appendix",
    "[ app : borninfeld ] , we show that our solutions satisfy the equations of motion of the non - abelian born - infeld action , and the other appendices contain several formulas used in the text .",

    "our first comment is concerning the behaviors of the scalars near the origin when @xmath3 is odd : one d3-brane @xmath217 with @xmath207 stick to the rest @xmath134 branes with an angle when @xmath3 is odd . noticing that the r - r charge @xmath218 vanishes only for this particular @xmath112 ( c.f .",
    "( [ eq : g_a ] ) ) , this phenomenon would be ascribed to the fact that we are describing the bps states by the classical treatment of the sym theory ( i.e.  electrically ) as we mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "secondly , the fact that all the d3-brane surfaces have a common tangent at the origin when @xmath3 is even means that all of them can not be globally straight in the transverse plane .",
    "otherwise , the charges @xmath48 are all parallel .",
    "this is the case also when @xmath3 is odd as is seen from the force balance condition .      from the discussions in the previous subsection ,",
    "the solutions with non - parallel electric and magnetic charges are necessarily described by curved lines .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : string - network ] and appendix  [ app : network ] , the asymptotic behavior ( @xmath219 ) of the curved lines reproduces the multi - pronged string configuration in the string picture . in this subsection , we shall point out that this feature can be extended to any finite @xmath69 .",
    "the basic equations used in the proof of appendix  [ app : network ] are for simplicity without losing generality . ]",
    "[ eq : relat1 ] & & _ a=1^n(u_ay_a - v_ax_a)=0 , + [ eq : relat2 ] & & ( u_a , v_a)=-(e_a , g_a ) , + [ eq : relat3 ] & & u=|q_x+m_y|=2|_a=1^ne_ax_a+_a=1^ng_ay_a| .",
    "thus if we can define quantities at finite @xmath69 which satisfy the equations similar to ( [ eq : relat1 ] ) , ( [ eq : relat2 ] ) and ( [ eq : relat3 ] ) , then one can conclude the same results as in appendix[app : network ] , that is , we can form a multi - pronged string in the string picture using the tangent vectors at @xmath69 , and the configuration has the satisfactory properties concerning the tensions of the strings , the bps bound , the formation of a planer tree junction diagram , etc .",
    "the natural generalization of @xmath220 and @xmath115 would be just given by the diagonal elements of the higgs fields @xmath221 and @xmath222 , where we assume a gauge in which @xmath223 and @xmath95 are diagonal .",
    "viewing the asymptotic behaviors ( [ eq : asx ] ) and ( [ eq : asy ] ) , the generalization of @xmath144 would be @xmath224 , where the prime denotes the derivative in the radial direction .",
    "then the generalization of ( [ eq : relat1 ] ) would be expected as @xmath225 it is enough to show ( [ eq : wronskian ] ) on the positive @xmath90-axis because of the spherical symmetry .",
    "both @xmath226 and @xmath227 satisfy the same differential equations ( [ eq : x  ] ) , which is in the form @xmath228 with a symmetric matrix @xmath229 .",
    "using this fact and taking a derivative of ( [ eq : wronskian ] ) , one finds @xmath230 .",
    "since @xmath231 at @xmath232 from ( [ eq : relat1 ] ) , the equation ( [ eq : wronskian ] ) holds in the whole space .",
    "now let us define the @xmath69-dependent charges @xmath233 by the electric and magnetic fields in the radial direction : @xmath234 where the diagonal form of the @xmath235 and @xmath236 is guaranteed by ( [ eq : dy2 ] ) coming from the spherical symmetry anzats .",
    "then ( [ eq : relat2 ] ) trivially holds from the bogomolnyi equations ( [ eq : dx = e ] ) and ( [ eq : dy = b ] ) .    as for the last equation ( [ eq : relat3 ] ) , we first define the energy in the spherical region @xmath237 in the d3-brane world volume by u_r=_|x|<rd^3x   u , where @xmath238 is the energy density appearing in ( [ eq : h2 ] ) . because of bps saturation , the equality in ( [ eq : bpsbound ] ) holds for the energy @xmath239 and the charges @xmath240 and @xmath241 , the definitions of which follow ( [ eq : q&m ] ) for the spherical region @xmath237 . from ( [ eq : dx = e ] ) and ( [ eq : dy = b ] ) , @xmath242 holds , and hence the two charges do not contribute to the bps bound of @xmath239 .",
    "plugging ( [ eq : dy2 ] ) and the same equation for @xmath22 into the definitions of the charges @xmath243 and @xmath244 and noting the fact that the second term of ( [ eq : dy2 ] ) does not contribute , they become q_x(r)=4r^2 tr(x(r)x(r)),m_y(r)=4r^2 tr(y(r)y(r ) ) .",
    "thus from the definition of the effective charges ( [ eq : effective_eg ] ) and the bogomolnyi equations ( [ eq : dx = e ] ) and ( [ eq : dy = b ] ) , the same equation as ( [ eq : relat3 ] ) holds for the quantities we have defined .    because of the regularity of the solutions at @xmath123 , it is a general property that the effective charges @xmath233 vary as functions of @xmath69 and tend to zero as @xmath245 .",
    "if the ratio @xmath246 depends on @xmath69 , the d3-brane trajectories bend .",

    "the three straight lines starting at @xmath247 in the direction @xmath248 meets at a common point .",
    "namely , the trajectories of the d3-branes on the transverse plane is developed in such a way that for every @xmath69 the tangent lines to the trajectories form a string junction carrying the effective charges .",
    "up to now we have considered the cases with distinct @xmath115 .",
    "when some of the @xmath115 degenerate , we can construct solutions with magnetic charges different from ( [ eq : g_a ] ) @xcite . in this subsection , we shall discuss solutions with degenerate @xmath115 for the @xmath15 case .",
    "since we have @xmath249 , the patterns of the degeneracy are classified as @xmath250 with @xmath251 . as stated in sec .",
    "[ sec : neartheorigin ] , the analysis of the solutions of the differential equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) at @xmath252 does not depend on the values of @xmath115 . on the other hand , as we shall show below , the asymptotic behaviors of the solutions change drastically .",
    "let us first examine the case ( i ) .",
    "since eq .",

    "( [ eq : sum ] ) and taking the limit @xmath256 , we obtain the asymptotic behaviors @xmath257 it follows from these equations that the magnetic charges of this solution are given by @xmath258 .",
    "then , substituting ( [ eq : asympq ] ) into ( [ eq : am = qm ] ) , the differential equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) in the asymptotic region is approximated as @xmath259 where @xmath260 is a column vector @xmath261 , and the dotted part is multiplied by the powers of the exponentially decaying factor @xmath262 . since the eigenvalues of the @xmath263 matrix in ( [ eq : su4i ] ) are @xmath264 and @xmath192 ( doubly degenerate ) , there are two independent divergent modes which behave as @xmath214 for large @xmath69 . in order to obtain a physically sensible @xmath135",
    ", we have to adjust two of the parameters of the solution to eliminate the divergent modes . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : neartheorigin ] , the number of free parameters in the @xmath15 solution @xmath22 regular at @xmath123 is three . therefore , we are left with only one free parameter .",
    "recalling that the other scalar @xmath23 is already a solution to the same differential equation as for @xmath22 with regular behavior ( [ eq : asy ] ) at @xmath35 , we find that @xmath22 must be proportional to @xmath23 , implying that the solution is an uninteresting one with parallel charge vectors .",
    "analysis for the case ( ii ) leads to the same situation , namely , two divergent modes exist at infinity .",
    "hence we conclude that for ( i ) and ( ii ) there is no non - trivial regular solution .",
    "next , let us consider the case ( iii ) .",
    "in this case , the magnetic charges of the solutions are @xmath265 , @xmath266 and @xmath267 corresponding to three different degeneracy patterns of @xmath138 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 and @xmath270 , respectively .",
    "we shall take the case @xmath268 .",
    "then , similarly to eq .",
    "( [ eq : su4i ] ) , the differential equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) is approximated for large @xmath69 as @xmath271 in this case , the eigenvalues of the @xmath263 matrix are @xmath264 ( doubly degenerate ) and @xmath192 , and there is only one harmful divergent mode . therefore ,",
    "contrary to the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , there can be non - trivial solutions since we still have two free parameters in the solution after eliminating one divergent mode .",
    "for these solutions regular at @xmath35 we have @xmath272 this is because eq .",
    "( [ eq : su4iii ] ) implies @xmath273 for @xmath274 , and the divergent @xmath214 term in the solution at @xmath35 has been eliminated by fine - tuning to leave the @xmath275 term . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : x1-x2 ] ) and the asymptotic expressions ( [ eq : asx ] ) and ( [ eq : asy ] ) , we find that @xmath276 and @xmath277 hold for the present solution . in the iib string picture , two strings @xmath191 and @xmath192",
    "degenerate completely , and the situation is reduced to the three - pronged string .",
    "an example of the solutions for @xmath278 obtained by a numerical method is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dege ] .",
    "we see that two d3-brane surfaces @xmath191 and @xmath192 approaches to each other as @xmath35 as mentioned above , though at the origin they behave in the way explained in secs .",
    "[ sec : su(4)exact ] and [ sec : neartheorigin ] .",
    "in the string picture , the existence of a three - pronged string connecting three parallel d3-branes depends on its two - form charges and the relative locations of the d3-branes @xcite .",

    "since the force balance condition determines the relative directions of the three strings meeting at the junction , the shape of the triangle formed by the three d3-branes is constrained .",
    "one can show easily that the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a three - pronged string connecting the d3-branes are given by the following conditions for each angle @xmath286 at the vertices @xmath287 of the triangle : _",
    "i  for  different  i , j , k .",
    "[ angine ] here angle@xmath288 $ ] denotes the angle between the two vectors @xmath289 and @xmath290 having a common initial point .",
    "when the length of one of the strings vanishes , one of the equalities holds in ( [ angine ] ) . in such cases the configuration is a stable bps state with two strings located at the same point in the d3-brane world volume .",
    "when the d3-brane locations are changed further out of ( [ angine ] ) , the stability may be lost .",
    "thus the process of changing d3-brane locations from ( [ angine ] ) to the outside may be observed as a decay process of a field theory bps state of a three - pronged string to two dyon states @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when two strings with some two - form charges are located at a finite distance in the d3-brane world volume , and the configuration of the d3-branes satisfies ( [ angine ] ) , the strings may attract each other and decay to the stable bps state of a three - pronged string .",
    "thus the evaluation of the force between two dyons would be another way to see the conditions ( [ angine ] ) . in this section",

    "the trajectories bend non - trivially and all the d3-brane surfaces meet at the origin @xmath123 .",

    "since any solution of supergravity corresponding to string junctions has not been constructed yet , we hope our brane realization of string junctions will give a certain insight to a supergravity realization of string junctions .",

    "it might shed light on the above problems if the formulation is extended to multi - pronged strings considering appropriate boundary conditions of 1-brane fields at junctions like those given in @xcite .",
    "since we use only two adjoint higgs fields in our strategy of solving the bogomolnyi equations , our results may be also applicable to @xmath329 sqcd .",

    "the following proof is based on a substitution rule which allows us to reduce the number @xmath3 of the strings emerging from the d3-branes ( we call these strings `` external string '' hereafter ) by one .",
    "for any two among the @xmath3 external strings , say the strings @xmath191 and @xmath192 , let us consider a new string @xmath330 carrying the charge @xmath331 .",
