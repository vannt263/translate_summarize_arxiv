    "it became nowadays popular to consider theories in extra dimensions as possible candidates for models of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "they provide new scenarios for the coupling unification as well as are able to elegantly solve some problems like doublet - triplet splitting , suppression of proton decay , susy breaking , etc .",
    "( see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein . ) usually , for the sake of simplicity one considers one extra dimension and then assumes compactification on the orbifold .",
    "particular models with @xmath1 compactification are shown to possess some interesting properties and may serve as a basis for the grand unified theories  @xcite . in this case , one has n=1 supersymmetry in a five - dimensional bulk which is equivalent to n=2 susy at a four dimensional brane .",
    "the field content of the resulting theory at the brane depends on the compactification prescription and on quantum numbers with respect to the orbifold symmetries adjusted to the fields .",
    "thus , below the compactification scale ( which might be the gut scale ) , one has the resulting d=4 theory on the brane with specific properties and above this scale one has a full n=1 d=5 theory in the bulk .",
    "one may wonder whether this extra dimensional theory can be considered as a consistent qft in any sense .",
    "since by general power counting it is non - renormalizable , it looks hardly possible .",
    "however , there is a chance that all the uv divergences cancel each other , like it takes place in n=4 ,  2 and even n=1 susy theories in d=4  @xcite , and one has a consistent theory .    one way to consider an extra dimensional theory is the kaluza - klein approach . in this case , one takes the fourier transform over the extra dimensions and obtains an infinite tower of states with quantized masses .",
    "then one has to sum over all the states .",
    "this sum is usually divergent and a special prescription is needed to regularize it . following this approach divergences in d=5 susy theory",
    "have been studied in  @xcite for the scalar effective potential .",
    "some cancellations of uv divergences have been found .",
    "the detailed structure of the k - k modes depends on the compactification pattern .",
    "provided that in the zero mode sector the divergences cancel each other , one may wonder if this is also possible at each floor of an infinite tower .",
    "this way one may get a finite theory .    in what follows , we investigate the other possibility and consider explicitly d=6 n=1 susy gauge theory .",
    "we show that indeed under certain circumstances uv divergences may cancel each other and one can have a totally finite consistent quantum field theory in extra dimensions .",
    "these models are very distinguished by their properties and may serve as a basis for susy gut models mentioned above .",
    "below we discuss some of their properties .",
    "we consider d=6 gauge qft with on shell n=1 supersymmetry formulated in components .",
    "d=6 is chosen for simplicity as the lowest even dimension .",
    "it has the same n=1 supersymmetry as the d=5 one ( equivalent to n=2 susy in d=4 ) , but the integration in even dimensions is more familiar ( in odd dimensions there are no one loop divergences in dimensional regularization which we are going to apply in the calculations ) .",
    "we do not take any particular compactification pattern , since the uv divergences do not depend on it ; they reflect the small distance properties where locally one has the flat minkowski metric .",
    "we assume that the theory is regularized in a susy invariant way but for practical purposes we take the dimensional regularization ( or reduction ) , since there is no difference in the one loop order as concerns the uv divergences .",
    "in what follows , we take the usual gauge invariant lagrangian for the gauge and matter fields , and choose the background field gauge as being more useful for the calculations",
    ". of course , the superfield formalism  @xcite would be most appropriate for our purposes and one should try to apply it .",
    "however , in this paper we confine ourselves to the component approach as a more familiar one .",
    "then , the gauge and n=1 susy invariant lagrangian in d=6 is  @xcite @xmath2-    \\frac{g^2}{2}|\\phi_1^\\dagger t^a\\phi_1-\\phi_2^\\dagger    t^a\\phi_2|^2 + 2g^2|\\phi_1^\\dagger t^a\\phi_2|^2    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and contains the following set of fields : one gauge field , @xmath3 , one weyl gaugino field , @xmath4 , a set of chiral matter fields in a representation @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and the corresponding complex scalar fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 .      in the gauge sector ,",
    "due to the background field gauge invariance the divergent structures in the one loop order can take one of the following forms : @xmath9 however , these invariants are not independent . due to the relation @xmath10=f_{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , and the bianchy identity @xmath11 one has only 2 independent structures and can choose any of them .",
    "we take the first two . then calculating the diagrams and extracting the contribution to two independent lorentz structures one can find the coefficients in front of them .",
    "the structures written above contain 2-,3-,4-,5- and 6-leg diagrams . for simplicity , we consider 2- and 3-point functions .",
    "we use the feynman rules from ref.@xcite .",
    "the calculation of the two - point function can be performed exactly in an arbitrary dimension .",
    "the result is proportional to the transverse tensor and the proper power of momenta .",
    "the coefficient functions are summarized in the table ( in feynman gauge ) .",
    ".the two - point gauge function [ cols=\"^,^,<,^,^ \" , ]     each sm particle in these models being projected to a 4-dimensional brane obtains the mirror partner in a conjugated representation @xmath12 , which has to be heavy enough not to be observed .",
    "this is the well - known problem in n=2 susy models in d=4 .",
    "it can be solved in the brane world scenario by adjusting proper quantum numbers to all the particles with respect to an orbifold symmetry group .",
    "one can then remove some unwanted particles from the sm brane confining them to another brane , etc  @xcite",
    ". there may be complicated scenarios when some particles are in the bulk while the others are confined to the brane .",
    "we do not consider these questions here , but concentrate on the construction of a consistent qft in extra dimensions .",
    "we have demonstrated how uv divergences cancel each other in some cases even in non - renormalizable models . in feynman gauge",
    "it is straightforward in the gauge sector but is rather tricky in the matter one .",
    "the situation can be simplified when going on shell ; however , since the equations of motion mix the matter fields due to the yukawa type interactions , one should consider all the invariants ( [ mat],[mat2],[mat3 ] ) together . this does not seem to be simple . on the other hand , as has already been mentioned , we would like to stay off shell to be able to go beyond one loop .",
    "unfortunately , we have not completed this task .",
    "we rely here on the superfield formalism which should simplify the situation drastically . on the other hand",
    ", the k - k approach can also be useful if cancellation of infinite towers level by level is really possible .",
    "if the n=1 d=6 susy theory inherits some properties of n=2 d=4 one ( see e.g.@xcite ) , where the uv divergences occur only in one loop , one can hope that these results are valid in higher orders as well .",
