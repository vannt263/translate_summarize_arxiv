    "in amorphous materials , a glass transition is observed when the temperature decreases from a high temperature in a liquid state to a lower temperature . below the glass transition temperature @xmath6 ,",
    "the structure of amorphous materials is disordered , and the mobility due to a primary motion , which is usually called the @xmath7-process , is lost .",
    "thus , the system is in a _",
    "glassy state_. however , even in the glassy state , there is a very slow relaxation toward an equilibrium state  @xcite . this slow relaxation is called aging and is regarded as an important common property characteristic of disordered materials , such as spin glasses  @xcite , orientational glasses  @xcite , supercooled liquids  @xcite , relaxor ferroelectrics  @xcite , and polymer glasses  @xcite . among the most interesting phenomena observed in the aging behavior are _ memory and rejuvenation _ effects  @xcite .",
    "the elucidation of these effects is essential for understanding the aging dynamics in glassy states and also the nature of the glass transition .    in our previous papers",
    ", we reported that the dielectric susceptibility of polymer glasses , poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma )  @xcite , and polystyrene ( ps )  @xcite shows memory and rejuvenation effects during an aging process below @xmath6 . in these measurements ,",
    "the system was quenched from a temperature above @xmath6 to an initial temperature @xmath2 , at which the system is aged for time @xmath8 .",
    "the temperature is then shifted to a lower temperature @xmath3 ( @xmath9 ) and maintained at this temperature for time @xmath10 .",
    "the temperature is then returned to and maintained at @xmath2 .",
    "although in the first stage at @xmath2 the imaginary part of the ac - dielectric susceptibility @xmath11 decreases with increasing aging time @xmath12 ( referred to as _ aging _ ) , it increases to a higher value and then begins to decrease again just after the temperature is shifted to @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior is called _",
    "rejuvenation_. if @xmath0 is large enough , the relaxation of dielectric susceptibility , which restarts at time @xmath12=@xmath8 , is approximately the same as that observed just after quenching directly from a high temperature ( @xmath13 ) to @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , at time @xmath12=@xmath14 , the value of the dielectric susceptibility returns to the value that @xmath11 had reached at time @xmath12=@xmath8 , and then begins to decrease as if the system had not experienced the lower temperature @xmath3 .",
    "this is called the _ perfect memory effect_. the memory and rejuvenation effects are also observed in the real part of ac - susceptibility @xmath15 for pmma .",
    "it should be noted that the memory and rejuvenation effects on @xmath15 and @xmath16 observed in polymer glasses are quite similar to those observed for ac - magnetic susceptibility @xmath17 in spin glass systems , although there is a large difference in structure between polymeric materials and spin glass .",
    "therefore , it is thought that there is a universal physical phenomenon related to this aging behavior .",
    "an important concept for understanding glassy dynamics including memory and rejuvenation effects is the correlation length @xmath18 after aging for time @xmath12 at temperature @xmath5 .",
    "this quantity was originally introduced to describe the spin - spin correlation in spin glass phase  @xcite . in the present case , in which the dielectric susceptibility @xmath19 of polymers is discussed",
    ", we can assume that the correlation length @xmath18 describes the spatial correlation of dipole moments attached to the polymer chains .",
    "in this case , the correlation length @xmath18 suggests that there is an ordered domain with a characteristic size of @xmath18 , where spins or dipole moments are aligned in an orderly manner .    here",
    ", we consider a temperature - shift ( @xmath5-shift ) protocol , in which after the system is cooled down from a high temperature ( above @xmath20 ) to @xmath2 ( below @xmath20 ) and is aged at @xmath2 for time @xmath8 , the temperature is rapidly shifted to @xmath3 and is maintained at @xmath3 for time @xmath10 .",
    "this @xmath5-shift protocol is denoted as @xmath21 . during the @xmath5-shift protocol",
    ", we measure @xmath22 .",
    "we can then determine an effective time @xmath23 such that the relation @xmath24 is satisfied for any positive @xmath12 , where @xmath25 is the dielectric susceptibility obtained for an isothermal aging process at @xmath3 for an aging time @xmath26 .",
    "in practice , @xmath23 is a fitting parameter and is obtained from the observed data . from this effective aging time , we can evaluate the effective correlation length @xmath27 defined by the relation @xmath28 . in a _ cumulative aging _",
    "scenario , we can expect that @xmath29 in this case , successive aging at the different temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be added in a totally cumulative manner , although the growth rate of the correlation length may depend on the aging temperature . hence , the value of @xmath30 and @xmath8 can be described by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a function of @xmath8 , which depends on the choice of the initial and second temperatures , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "once a specific form of @xmath33 is given , the form of @xmath32 can be determined uniquely . in this case , there is a reversible aging between two temperatures .",
    "if this reversibility is violated , the aging is no longer cumulative , but rather it is _ non - cumulative_.    here , we introduce a reverse @xmath5-shift protocol ( @xmath3 , @xmath2 ) , where the system is aged at @xmath3 for time @xmath10 , and the temperature then is shifted from @xmath3 to @xmath2 . for this protocol , we can obtain another effective aging time @xmath34 , which satisfies the relation @xmath35 in the case of cumulative aging , we can also expect that @xmath36 in order to check whether the aging is cumulative or non - cumulative , _ a twin @xmath5-shift experiment _ has been proposed in the studies on spin glass by jnsson , yoshino , and nordbald  @xcite . in the twin @xmath5-shift experiment , a pair of @xmath5-shift experiments (",

    "although the present results suggest the possibility of the existence of temperature chaos in polymer glasses , the above - described differences between spin glasses and polymer glasses should also be resolved in the near future .    finally , the microscopic origin of the decrease in dielectric susceptibility should be discussed . in the case of pmma",

    "hence , the decrease in the dielectric susceptibility during isothermal aging process is a characteristic property common for physical aging of various polymeric systems , although the microscopic origin of this decrease is not fully understood .",

    ", it is expected that the densification occurs , and hence the dielectric susceptibilities under high pressure might be compared to those during aging process .",
    "however , the results under high pressure are opposite to those in our measurements",
    ". therefore , there must be another physical origin which decreases dielectric susceptibility and overcomes the densification .",
    "during the course of physical aging two possible scenarios are possible : 1 ) physical aging is probed well below the glass transition temperature , implying that the @xmath7-process is totally frozen and only secondary relaxation processes , associated with localized motion , are dynamically active . in this case ,",
    "orientational polarization associated with these processes would be reduced during physical aging ; 2 ) physical aging is probed just below the glass transition temperature and the high frequency tail of the @xmath7-process is probed . in this latter case",
    "the decrease in the dielectric susceptibility is simply due to a shift of this tail to lower frequency  @xcite . in the case of pmma , there is a contribution from the @xmath108-process below @xmath6 which is associateed with a localized motion of branches attached to polymer chains .",
    "furthermore , measurements in the frequency domain of the dielecric loss clearly shows that the peak frequency of the @xmath108-process is not shifted , but the peak height decreases with increasing aging time without changing the shape of the dielectric spectrum during the isothermal aging process .",

    "<S> a crossover from cumulative aging to non - cumulative aging could be observed with increasing @xmath4 using a twin temperature ( @xmath5- ) shift measurement . </S>",
    "<S> based on a growth law of a dynamical coherent length given by activated dynamics , we obtained a unique coherent length for positive and negative @xmath5-shifts . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of the existence of temperature chaos in polymer glasses is discussed . </S>"
