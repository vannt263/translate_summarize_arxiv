    "considerable progress in the ability to interpret the data was done by dyks , rudak & rankin ( 2007 ; hereafter drr ) , who interpreted the notches as a direct imprint of the hollow beam intrinsic to the radiation emitted by electrons accelerated parallel to their velocity .",

    "we maintain this view that the apparently unrelated bifurcated emission components and double notches have common origin .",
    "the notches are regarded as a negative image of the elementary emission beam of the same radiative process that produces the bifurcated components .    in spite of the overall success of drr s model , the parallel acceleration beam was unable to explain the observed large depth of double notches .",

    "guided by the observed edge depolarisation of profiles ( see section [ depolsec ] ) we assume that in the outer wings of the beam , the  radiation is amplified with the same efficiency as the and is not attenuated .    the polarisation - structure of such a toy beam is shown in fig .",

    "the latter two effects were described by edwards , stappers & van leeuwen ( 2003 ) as ` multiple imaging ' possibly caused by refraction , birefringence or aberration / retardation effects .    without intending to model the phenomena in detail , we want to show that the low - frequency curvature radiation beam has several intrinsic properties that are consistent with the observations .",

    "whatever mechanism actually does it , a seemingly natural way to have equal amounts of two strictly - orthogonal modes , is to filter them proportionally out of a beam that already ( intrinsically ) includes equal amounts of radiation in the two orthogonal polarisation states .",
    "the curvature emission is then an ideal candidate , because in the outer wings of the elementary beam , it intrinsically produces equal amounts of radiation in the appropriate polarisation states .",
    "we therefore claim that the observed edge depolarisation has its origin in the intrinsically equal emissivity in both polarisation states .",
    "our line of sight can pass through the pulsar beam shown in fig .",

    "in the bottom case ( grazing the edge of the carousel ) it is probably a bit difficult to guess the averaged polarisation degree without numerical simulation . in the top case ,",

    "an interesting question is what happens when the stream has noticeable azimuthal width , that is comparable to ( or larger than ) the opening angle @xmath143 .",

    "however , on a closer inspection the widening ( mis - interpreted as rfm ) can appear at low frequencies , since the plasma density in the stream falls off with the transverse distance from the stream center / axis .",
    "so we assume that the basic principle of the broadening is the same as usual : low-@xmath2 radiation emerges from regions with lower density",
    ". however , the lower density regions in our scenario are simply the more extreme outskirts of the stream , ie .  the lower - density region located further away from the stream axis .",
    "thus , we replace the ` radius - to - frequency ' mapping with the ` stream - diameter - to - frequency ' mapping .",
    "this interpretation implies that all radio frequencies come from the same ( or similar ) range of altitudes .",
    "the small width @xmath214 of the emitter in the magnetic azimuth implies that the projected direction of magnetic field does not change much within the pulse window .",
    "thus , our scenario implies almost no change of polarisation angle ( pa ) due to the effect predicted by the rotating - vector - model ( rvm ) of radhakrishnan & cooke ( 1969 ) .",
    "the pa curve is predicted to stay flat only _ if _ it is dominated by the rvm effect , ie .  if the observed pa is determined by the projection of @xmath94 on the sky . if the pa is governed by non - rvm factors , then behaviour that is _ in general different _ from the rvm curve is expected .",

    "however , the non - rvm origin _ seems _ to be plain inconsistent with the paramount examples of the rvm exhibited by two well - known representatives of the d - class : b0301@xmath019 and b0525@xmath021 .",
    "they are widely believed to present textbook cases of the rvm - generated pa curve .",
    "we claim that here again we become victims of maliciously deceiving degeneration of nature .",
    "the rvm model is really what the name says : a curve determined by the sky - projection of a vector that rotates under our line of sight .",
    "the projection of the circumpolar @xmath97-field lines is just one example of such a vector .",
    "the other examples , not even slightly less natural than the projected @xmath94 , are the vectors of electric field in the radiation pattern surrounding the instantaneous velocity of a relativistic particle .",
    "we argue that the famous s - swing of pa in the b0525@xmath021 ( and other d pulsars ) is mostly caused by intrinsic effects .",
    "it is due to the cut of our sightline through the elementary ( microscopic )  curvature beam .",
    "a rather complicated code would be needed to prove it numerically . instead of that , we choose to delinate the mechanism qualitatively . in fig .",
    "[ norvm]a the observed pulse profile of a d - class pulsar is decomposed into the elementary beams , emitted from three locations in the stream .",
    "the thick curve presents the bifurcated -dominated beam emitted from the center of the stream .",

    "the edge beams have their outside parts brightened by the presence of the . within the phase interval marked with the letter ` a ' , the polarisation properties are determined by relative proportions of the two modes .",
    "if the segregation of the modes is not efficient in 100% , a substantial elliptical polarisation appears there ( as is often observed ) . in the phase interval ` b ' the flux observed at each phase always corresponds to the _ maximum _ of different elementary beams , emitted at different locations in the stream .",
    "the changes of pa within the interval ` b ' are therefore dominated by the changes of the @xmath94 field direction .",
    "thus , it is in the phase interval b , where the emission from different elementary beams is averaged out and can reveal the underlying geometry of magnetic field . in this interval",
    "the observed average pa curve can follow the rvm model .",
    "this can only happen if the width of the phase interval b is noticeably large ( the width is determined by the relative width of the stream and the opening angle @xmath143 of the  beam ) .",
    "the corresponding parts of the pa curve of b0525@xmath021 are indeed very flat ( and highly polarised because of the domination of the ) .        in the phase interval",
    "` c ' the situation changes completely : for @xmath215 the flux at each phase is now dominated by radiation from a single elementary beam .",
    "our line of sight does not sample different beams emitted from different locations in the stream .",

    "fixed _ direction of @xmath94 ) . for @xmath216 ( still in the c interval ) , the line of sight",
    "again samples a single elementary beam .",
    "therefore , in the innermost parts of the double conal profiles , the pa is determined by the intrinsic polarisation properties of the  curvature beam . as shown in fig .",
    "[ kleszcz ] , the orientation of the polarisation vectors ( vectors of the electric field @xmath217 of the emitted wave ) in the instantaneous -beam ensures the same variations of the pa as the projected magnetic field in the rvm model .",
    "this interpretation is based on the intrinsic properties of the emitted radiation and assumes that they are not affected by any adiabatic walking below the polarisation - limiting radius ( eg .",
    "cheng & ruderman 1979 ; melrose 1979 ; lyubarsky 2002 ) .",
    "we thereby disclose a perverse situation , in which the central parts of the observed pa curve , that resemble the rvm shape so closely , have the origin that has nothing to do with the rvm idea . on the contrary ,",
    "the outer flat parts of the observed pa curve ( interval b ) are more likely to reflect the underlying orientation of @xmath218 and to comply with the rvm origin . had this been the case , the difference of pa measured in the outer wings of the profile @xmath219 would provide information about the azimuthal width of the stream : @xmath220 ( provided",
    "the pa observed in the a and b region is not biased / dominated by intrinsic effects ) .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached in a different way , by considering the case of an infinitely - thin stream , and noting that the observed pa curve should change continously for small increase of the stream width .",
    "specifically , for a stream of electrons flowing only along a single @xmath97-field line , the observed pa curve definitely has to be determined fully by the intrinsic swing shown in fig .",
    "[ kleszcz ] .",
    "this is because the spatial extent of the emitter is a delta function and there is no variation of the underlying direction of @xmath94 .",
    "a small increase of the diameter of the stream must , by continuity , produce only small changes of the initial pa curve .",
    "the increasing spread of @xmath94 within the stream of increasing thickness will therefore produce only a gradual change in the observed pa curve .",
    "we therefore conclude that in general the observed pa curves of pulsars are a convolution of intrinsic pa and @xmath97-field projection .",
    "since the opening angle of the curvature beam decreases with increasing frequency , the pa curve is expected to depend on @xmath2 , which is indeed the case for b0525@xmath021 ( and other objects ) . because the -radiation has a minimum in the profile center ( fig .",
    "[ norvm ] ) , any remnants of the  emission can produce a minimum of polarisation degree there .",
    "even such detail is also observed in b0525@xmath021 ( eg .  fig .  1 in hr08 ) .",
    "in a more general case ( than the primitive picture of fig .  [ norvm ] ) , a large variety of pa curves is expected , depending on the 3d distribution of plasma density in the stream , on the geometry of passage of our sightline through the beam , on the ratio of both orthogonal modes , and on the size of the elementary curvature beam . for realistic density distribution",
    "the phase intervals b and c can overlap in phase , in which case the pa recorded at a given phase can be partly determined by the intrinsic pa and partly by the projection of @xmath94 .",
    "the subject deserves numerical study .",

    "if the streams are not exactly centered at the main meridian , the main - pulse - interpulse separation can differ from @xmath236 as it sometimes happens to be observed ( eg .  in b1055@xmath152 , weltevrede & wright 2009 ) .",
    "the components of the bfc class are observed at frequency - independent location in pulse profiles and widen with increasing @xmath2 roughly according to @xmath237 .    for the price of rejecting the rvm wisdom , we have also come to the conclusion , that the double conal profiles ( class d ) are also created by a cut through azimuthally - limited emitter , that is a bit broader than in the bfc case ( right bottom corner of fig .",
    "[ bcake ] ) .",
    "the width of such profiles is mostly determined by the fixed width of the stream . any low - frequency widening ( of non - rfm nature ) can result from density gradient in the outskirts of the stream .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath238 widening can also contribute to the apparent effect .",
    "the fan - beam origin of pulse profiles is probably not limited to the d class .",
    "the profile of b1929@xmath010 is likely created by a cut through a structured stream , or through a few nearby streams . at 430 mhz ,",
    "its profile has a pronounced emission component on the trailing side of the maximum , which separates from the maximum at a rate roughly consistent with @xmath238 . moreover , in the minimum between the component and the central maximum , noticeable amount of orthogonal polarisation mode appears ( rankin & rathnasree 1997 ) .",
    "this kind of corellation ( appearance of another polarisation mode at a minimum in total flux ) could in principle be produced by any process that removes the dominating mode .",
    "however , here we find again that the -dominated curvature beam ( case @xmath85b in fig .  [ etaperp]a ) has the appropriate intrinsic property to produce the phenomenon ( domination of the  at the minimum of the ) .12 ( fig .  7 in mitra ,",
    "sarala , & rankin 2004 ) . ]",
    "we therefore suggest that the ` multiple ' appearance of the profile of b1929@xmath010 is partially caused by the intrinsic doubleness of the curvature beam , and the real number of underlying streams is smaller than the number of observed components .",
    "if the radiation in the pedestal emission is averaged out to reveal the rvm polarisation angle , then this pedestal pa curve should be discordant with the pa curve observed under the main pulse ( because the latter is dominated by intrinsic effects ) .",
    "this likely explains the difficulty in fitting the full - period interval with a single pa curve ( rankin & rathnasree 1997 ; everett & weisberg 2001 ) .",
    "b0950@xmath008 may belong to the same , b1929@xmath010-like class : its profile tends to bifurcate at low @xmath2 .",
    "the extended leading - bridge of this profile is likely caused by a stream that extends roughly tangentially to the trajectory made by our line of sight .",
    "the bridge culminates in an interpulse which again reveals doubleness ( mclaughlin & rankin 2004 ) .",
    "a paramount example of stream - cut - generated profile is provided by j0437@xmath14715 in which the tendency to ` look double ' is revealed both in the complicated central parts and in the conal components . whereas the core can be produced in the usual way ( a cut through the dipole - axis - centered rings ) it may also be created by streams flowing near the main meridian . the outer ",
    "conal \" components are definitely produced by streams with large @xmath157 .",
    "deconvolution of this ( and other ) profiles into the underlying emitting structures ( streams ) can only be done if the bifurcated nature of the elementary curvature beam is taken into account .",
    "the bifurcated component of can be comparably - well fitted with both the parallel - acceleration emission and the curvature radiation .",
    "however , only the curvature radiation can match the data simultaneously at two frequencies .",
    "the two - planar topology of the -dominated curvature beam makes it very easy to reproduce the observed large depth of double notches .",
    "it also explains the origin of bifurcated components in terms of very natural geometry ( sightline cuts through plasma streams ) .",
    "this leads us to the firm conclusion that the observed coherent radio emission from pulsars is the curvature radiation .",
    "components in radio pulsar profiles become wider , and finally bifurcate at low - frequencies because of the intrinsic behaviour of the curvature beam . the scale of the bifurcation makes it possible to determine the radius of curvature of electron trajectory in the emission region , provided global geometry parameters are known .",
    "double  conal \" profiles ( d class ) are not conal in the usual sense .",
    "they are produced by the sightline cut through slightly broader streams .",
    "the pa curves of such profiles are not determined by the projection of the @xmath94-field on the sky plane .",
    "even when they resemble the rvm shape ( which they do rarely ) , the pa curves are mostly determined by the microphysical polarisation structure of the  curvature pattern .",
    "the s - swing created by a cut through such single pattern is exactly the same as in the rvm case .",
    "angular / spatial convolution of more patterns leads to a variety of observed pa curves .",
    "the low - frequency broadening of d - type profiles results from plasma density gradient at the outer surface of the stream , and from the intrinsic broadening of the curvature beam .",
    "it does not reflect the emission radius ( it does not have the rfm origin ) .",
    "the narrow - stream geometry of the emitter implies fan - like shapes of pulsar emission beams .",
    "this naturally explains the extremely slow changes of pulse width due to the geodetic precession .",
    "the existence of fan - shaped beams increases the likelihood of observing an interpulse .",
    "it also implies that the number of pulsars in the galaxy may be smaller than estimated with the conal beams .",
    "the results of this paper invalidate the traditional methods of determination of the radio emission altitude at least for d - class pulsars .",
    "this refers both to the geometrical method , and the one based on the relativistic - shift of pa curve .",
    "the curvature - radiation beam with the partially - attenuated has several features that are qualitatively consistent with many observed properties of pulsars .",
    "the features include the non - zero width of the curvature beam , the mirror symmetry with respect to the b - field line plane , the ` striped ' ( aziumuthally - separated ) polarisation structure , and the intrinsic 1:1 ratio of the orthogonal polarisation modes at the beam edge .",
    "they enable us to roughly comprehend the multiple imaging , azimuthal separation of modes , edge depolarisation , and the polarisation structure of d - type profiles .",
    "the stream origin is likely for other types of pulsar profiles . in attempts to decipher specific cases",
    ", it may be more efficient to think in terms of spoke - like , or wedge - like emitter , not in terms of ` conal or patchy ' .",
    "several coherency mechanisms for the amplification of the curvature radiation had been proposed .",
    "they are usually divided into the bunching processes , and the maser processes , and both are reportedly problematic ( melrose 2006 ) .",
    "the elementary beam of the coherent curvature radiation , that we have invoked from the fits of section [ fits ] and from the pulsar properties of section [ appli ] suggests that the coherency is not due to the curvature - drift - driven maser ( zheleznyakov & shaposhnikov 1979 ; luo & melrose 1992 , hereafter lm92 ) nor due to the maser induced by the field - line torsion ( luo & melrose 1995 ) . it is true that the first model predicts the required two - planar topology of the beam and the correct frequency dependence of @xmath42 .",
    "however , the maser implies intrinsically asymmetric beam which does not seem to be consistent with the wonderful symmetry of the double features .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  1 of lm92 .",
    "the amplified parts of the non - coherent beam ( determined by the negative absorption coefficient @xmath239 in the bottom - right panel ) are located asymmetrically with respect to the plane of electron trajectory ( at the angles marked @xmath240 and @xmath241 in the figure of lm92 ) .",
    "the maser operating thanks to the @xmath97-field line torsion ( luo & melrose 1995 ) amplifies the radiation at extremely small angles with respect to @xmath94 .",
    "the bunching - induced coherency ( eg .  due to the two - stream instability , ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) seems to have less problems with the quasi - isotropic amplification of the non - coherent beam .",
    "recently this idea was studied by gil , lyubarsky & melikidze ( 2004 ) in their version of ` soliton bunching ' . in their figure 3",
    "they present elementary beams of the  radiation that are fairly similar to the bfc of .",
    "it is less clear if their mechanism can amplify comparable amounts of the  in the outer parts of the beam .    the idea of  fan \" beams appeared from time to time in pulsar literature .",
    "narayan & vivekanand ( 1983 ) considered an elongated beam to model the notorious profile of b0950@xmath008 .",
    "however , the beam elongation in their model ( fig .  2 therein ) was still caused by a deformation ( squeezing ) of a conal beam and did not have the stream - like topology . + it is peculiar that in the past the fan - beam origin of profile components has not been emphasized sufficiently enough to spark development of a spoke - like model of pulsar beams .",
    "the intrinsic fan - beam topology of the curvature radiation has been known from the early days of synchrotron radiation theory , and the tendency of curvature radiation to produce double components has even been incidentally illustrated in the literature ( eg .  figs .  2 and 3 in ahmadi & gangadhara 2002 ) .",
    "we conclude that the long - sought rosetta stone needed to decipher the nature of pulsar radio emission has finally been identified as the double features in averaged pulse profiles .",
