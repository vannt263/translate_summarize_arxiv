    "although little is known about the mass function of nuclear black holes with mass below about @xmath6 , this is an important regime for several reasons .",
    "for example , the remarkable correlation between host bulge velocity dispersion and black hole mass strongly hints that black holes play an essential role in galaxy evolution @xcite , yet there are few observational constraints on the starting conditions , or so - called seeds , for the supermassive black holes with masses above about @xmath6 .",
    "also , until the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ launches , an understanding of the low - mass end of the black - hole mass function may provide one of the few constraints on these seed black holes @xcite .",
    "moreover , it remains to be established whether small galaxies can commonly host nuclear black holes and , if so , whether the same mass versus dispersion relation mentioned above is obeyed .",
    "motivated by these and similar issues , @xcite conducted the first systematic search for a population of black holes with mass below about @xmath6 .",
    "they used sdss dr1 to select a sample of broad - lined active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with virial mass estimates @xmath7 .",
    "this sample of 19 objects was the first uniformly selected sample of low - mass agns .",
    "the sample is characterized by eddington ratios , @xmath8 , that are close to unity , implying radiatively efficient accretion onto these black holes . with its low - mass black holes and high eddington ratios , this",
    "sample probes a poorly explored region of parameter space , potentially providing new insights into the physical drivers of radio properties in agns .",
    "for this reason , @xcite observed the sample at 4.9 ghz with the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "a single object , , was detected with a 4.9-ghz  to  optical flux ratio @xmath9 , formally radio - quiet @xcite . a stacked image of the remaining 18 objects yielded an upper limit of @xmath10 , emphasizing the atypical traits of gh10 .    to help understand the physical origin of these atypical traits ,",
    "new multi - frequency vla data were obtained on gh10 and are presented in section 2 .",
    "as summarized in section 3.1 , the radio emssion from gh10 is found to be compact , steep - spectrum , unpolarized , and steady in time .",
    "a star - formation origin for this emission is considered , and dismissed , in section 3.2 , while section 3.3 explores the implications of a black - hole origin for the radio emission .",
    "the paper ends , in section 4 , with a summary of the key findings and suggestions for future directions .",
    "the following cosmological parameters are assumed : @xmath11  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 @xcite , leading to a luminosity distance of 363  mpc @xcite .",
    "also , the sign convention adopted for the spectral index @xmath4 near a frequency @xmath14 is the flux density @xmath15 .",
    "the vla was used in the a configuration @xcite to observe gh10 under proposal code ag745 on ut 2007 jun 18 and 2007 jul 15 .",
    "observations were phase - referenced to the calibrator j1224 + 0330 whose positional accuracy was 0.01 .",
    "the switching angle was 5 , while the switching times were 560  s , 260  s , and 200  s for observations at center frequencies of 1.4000 , 4.8601 , and 8.4601  ghz , respectively .",
    "these frequencies will be abbreviated as 1.4 , 4.9 , and 8.5  ghz hereafter .",
    "the _ a priori _ pointing position for gh10 was centered 3 south of the sdss position @xcite to avoid any phase - center artifacts .",
    "observations were made assuming a coordinate equinox of 2000 .",
    "data were acquired with a bandwidth of 100  mhz for each circular polarization .",
    "observations of 3c286 were used to set the amplitude scale to an accuracy of about 3% .    on 2007",
    "jun 18 , net exposure times were 1500  s , 7800  s , and 8300  s at 1.4 , 4.9 , and 8.5  ghz , respectively .",
    "twenty - five to 27 antennas provided data of acceptable quality , with most of the data loss attributable to evla retrofitting activities . the observations at 1.4  ghz were made at a large hour angle and were followed by alternating observations at 4.9 and 8.5  ghz to sample similar hour angles . on 2007 jul 15 ,",
    "1.4-ghz observations were made at transit and resulted in a net exposure time of 2800  s. twenty - four antennas provided data of acceptable quality , with most of the data loss attributable to evla retrofitting activities and software failures .",
    "the data were calibrated using the 2007 dec 31 release of the nrao aips software .",
    "no self - calibrations were performed .",
    "no polarization calibration was performed , as only upper limits to the linear polarization percentages were sought .",
    "the aips task imagr was used to form and deconvolve images of the emission from gh10 .",
    "following @xcite , imagr was used to form and deconvolve stokes @xmath16 images at 4.9 and 8.5  ghz at a matched resolution at fwhm of 0.42 .",
    "this led to detections of a compact source at both frequencies , with no evidence for adjacent emission on larger scales .",
    "the 4.9  ghz image appears in figure  1 .",
    "quadratic fits in the image plane yielded the integrated flux densities and the two - point spectral index given in table  1 . these flux densities from 2007 jun 18 are plotted in figure  2 .",
    "the image fits also yielded identical deconvolved diameters of less than 0.21 , as well as almost identical positions .",
    "the 4.9-ghz position is @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with a 1-d error of 0.1 , the quadratic sum of terms due to the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the detection ( less than 0.01 ) , the phase - calibrator position error ( 0.01 ) , and the phase - referencing strategies ( estimated to be 0.1 ) .",
    "this 4.9-ghz position is consistent with the sdss position @xcite marked in figure  1 .",
    "imagr was also used to form matched - resolution images of stokes @xmath19 and @xmath20 at 4.9 and 8.5  ghz .",
    "those images led to no detections , with the most constraining upper limit to the linear polarization percentage being less than 11% at 4.9  ghz .",
    "following @xcite , imagr was used in a two - step approach to form and deconvolve stokes @xmath16 images at 1.4  ghz .",
    "first , a search for confusing sources was done by using the inner array baselines to image , at low resolution , the primary antenna beam to the half - power point .",
    "second , all array baselines were used to image gh10 and its confusing sources , simultaneously and at a high resolution of about 1.4 at fwhm . from the gh10 data acquired at transit on 2007 jul 15 , this approach led to a high - resolution image mildly affected by confusion , showing a compact detection plus no evidence for adjacent emission on larger scales ; a quadratic fit in the image plane yielded the integrated flux density in table  1 and a deconvolved diameter of less than 0.72 . from the gh10 data acquired at a large hour angle on 2007 jun 18 ,",
    "the high - resolution image was more degraded by confusion so only a parabolic fit in the image plane was made .",
    "this yielded the peak flux density in table  1 that is plotted in figure  2 .",
    "that figure also shows the spectral index @xmath1 derived from all the photometry on 2007 jun 18 .",
    "finally , the 4.9-ghz data were used to produce an image at the fwhm resolution of the 1.4-ghz data on 2007 jun 18 . a parabolic fit to that 4.9-ghz image gave the flux density listed in table  1 , leading in turn to the tabulated spectral index between 1.4 and 4.9  ghz . also , that 4.9-ghz flux density is consistent with the value obtained at a fwhm resolution of 0.42 implying no additional emission on scales between 0.42and about 1.4 .",
    "the new vla data imply that the emission from gh10 is compact , with a diameter of less than 0.21 ( 320  pc ) at 4.9  ghz ( fig .  1 ) and 8.5  ghz , and less than 0.72 ( 1.1  kpc ) at 1.4  ghz . these upper limits are derived from data with snrs of 15 or more .",
    "the new 1.4-ghz images show only a compact component and do not confirm the prior hint from low - snr data of marginally resolved emission with a fwhm diameter of 5 ( 7.5  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the new 4.9-ghz image does not confirm the prior suggestion from low snr - data of marginally - resolved emission with a fwhm diameter of 0.3 ( 530  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the emission from gh10 has a steep radio spectrum , with a three - point spectral index of @xmath1 measured on 2007 jun 18 and thus free from concerns about time variability ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this spectral index agrees with the two - point , matched - resolution spectral indices given in table  1 , as is expected for compact , unresolved emission .",
    "the single - epoch radio spectrum shown for gh10 in figure  2 - the first ever measured for any of the 19 low - mass agns discovered by greene and ho @xcite - is consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission . this emission is less than 11% linearly polarized at 4.9  ghz , well below the 73% expected for electrons with a power - law energy distribution , with index @xmath21 , in a uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "faraday depth effects could also be at play .",
    "variability timescales for agns are expected to scale with black - hole mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and have not yet been explored for any of the 19 low - mass greene and ho objects . the new vla photometry can be used to assess gh10 s time variabilty , for future comparison with other gh10 timescales to search for physical linkages . using only a - configuration data , the ratio of the 4.9-ghz flux density on 2007 jun 18 ( 0.75@xmath220.05  mjy ) to that on 2004 oct 9 ( 0.7@xmath220.1  mjy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is 7@xmath2216% , consistent with steady emission on timescales of years .",
    "the ratio of the 1.4-ghz flux density on 2007 jul 15 ( 1.88@xmath220.13  mjy ) to that on 2007 jun 18 ( 1.80@xmath220.09  mjy ) is 4@xmath229% , also consistent with steady emission on timescales of weeks .",
    "also , folding in the b - configuration survey of @xcite , the 1.4-ghz flux density of gh10 on 1998 aug 11 was 1.16@xmath220.16 mjy ( peak ) and 1.29@xmath220.16 mjy ( integrated ) .",
    "for such a low - snr and compact source , @xcite advocate using the peak flux density and seeking variability at the 4 @xmath23 , or greater , level . for gh10 ,",
    "the ratio of the flux density on 2007 jul 15 ( 1.88@xmath220.13 mjy ) to that earlier peak ( 1.16@xmath220.16 mjy ) is 62@xmath2216% , a change of less than 4 @xmath23 on a timescale of almost a decade .    in summary ,",
    "the radio emssion from gh10 is compact , steep - spectrum , unpolarized , and steady - although sparsely sampled - on timescales of weeks and years .",
    "the integrated 1.4-ghz flux density corresponds to a power of @xmath24  w  hz@xmath3 , while that at 4.9  ghz corresponds to a power of @xmath25  w  hz@xmath3 .",
    "the radio emission from gh10 might be driven , in part , by circumnuclear star formation .",
    "applying scanpi to _ infrared astronomical satellite _ data at 60  @xmath26 m , gh10 is undetected with a 3 @xmath23 upper limit of 0.15  jy . equation ( 2 ) of @xcite yields an upper limit to the 60-@xmath26 m power .",
    "inserting that limit into the radio - infrared relation in equation ( 4 ) of @xcite sets an upper limit of @xmath27  w  hz@xmath3 to the 1.4-ghz power expected from any star formation .",
    "this limit is below the observed power of @xmath24  w  hz@xmath3 , but not by much .",
    "a more telling analysis follows from consideration of the host galaxy s properties , especially as they relate to estimates for a star - formation rate .",
    "keck spectroscopy , with a 1 ( 1.5  kpc ) aperture , exhibit the mg i_b _ and ca ii infrared triplets characteristic of an old stellar population @xcite",
    ". _ hubble space telescope _ @xmath28 and @xmath29 imaging , with a resolution at fwhm of 0.12 ( 170  pc ) , reveals a smooth , spheroidal - looking system with a steep sersic index @xmath30 and a color @xmath31 that is characteristic of sa or spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "sdss spectroscopy with a 3 ( 4.5  kpc ) aperture shows narrow h@xmath4 and [ o  ii ] @xmath53727 lines but , as a balmer decrement could not be robustly measured , an estimate of the internal reddening is unavailable for gh10 @xcite .",
    "however , if the average reddening advocated for the 19 greene and ho objects by @xcite is adopted and the reddening curve of @xcite is applied , then the correction factors for narrow h@xmath4 and [ o  ii ] @xmath53727 are 1.3 and 1.7 , respectively . then using equations ( 2)-(3 ) of @xcite , those corrected line luminosities for gh10",
    "each imply a star formation rate no higher than 2  @xmath0  yr@xmath3 .",
    "these rate estimates are , by construction , upper limits because they neglect the portion of the line - emitting gas that is energized by the agn rather than by star formation . moreover , in order for gh10 to be within the 2 @xmath23 range of the radio - infrared relation mentioned above , the reddening at h@xmath4 would need to be 2 mag , far more than the average ( 0.3 mag ) and largest ( 0.5 mag ) reddening advocated for the greene and ho objects @xcite .",
    "fortunately , gh10 is also detected in a _",
    "irs spectrum , boding well for a future estimate of a star formation rate that is less affected by reddening concerns ( c. e. thornton et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    for comparison , using equation ( 13 ) of @xcite , the observed 1.4-ghz power of gh10 would correspond to a star - formation rate of 18  @xmath0  yr@xmath3 .",
    "such a high rate is clearly inconsistent with the line - based upper limit of 2  @xmath0  yr@xmath3 derived above .",
    "circumnuclear star formation can not , therefore , dominate the radio emission from gh10 .",
    "based on the above analysis , it seems plausible that the radio emission from gh10 is mainly energized by its low - mass black hole .",
    "gh10 is radiating at about twice its eddingtion luminosity , with this estimate being uncertain by a factor of 3 @xcite .",
    "thus comparisons of gh10 with other broad - lined agns with near - unity eddington ratios are especially apt . the 4.9-ghz  to  optical flux ratio for gh10 implies @xmath9 , so gh10 is radio - quiet @xcite , a trait shared by most quasars at @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "there is also a faint , compact _ chandra _ detection within 1 ( 1.5  kpc ) of the sdss position of gh10 , and its spectral properties resemble those of high - mass black holes @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the 4.9-ghz luminosity , @xmath33  ergs  s@xmath3 , to the hard x - ray luminosity , @xmath34  ergs  s@xmath3 , implies @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "such a value is also consistent with the values shown by most @xmath32 quasars and by most luminous seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such systems are too faint and too distant to be resolved on sub - kiloparsec scales in vla images , so no structural comparisons can be made .",
    "gh10 s values for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , plus its radio and hard x - ray luminosities , also resemble those for the more luminous palomar seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "vla imaging at 1.4 and 4.9  ghz of the palomar seyfert galaxies , with a resolution of about 1 ( 100  pc at the median distance of 20  mpc ) , shows a wide range of radio powers ( @xmath38  w  hz@xmath3 ) , spectral indices ( + 0.5 to -1 ) , and linear sizes ( a few tens of parsecs to 15  kpc ) @xcite .",
    "their structures mainly show a compact core , either unresolved or slightly resolved , sometimes with adjacent elongated , jetlike / outflow components .",
    "linearly polarized emission , while rarely detected , is preferentially associated with features adjacent to the cores .",
    "thus gh10 s radio properties most resemble those of the steep - spectrum cores of the palomar seyferts , for which the emission is unmodified by the effects of internal and/or external opacity . like the palomar seyferts ,",
    "the steep - spectrum emission from gh10 could be outflow - driven .",
    "moreover , the lower escape velocity from gh10 s dwarf host galaxy @xcite would make it easier for any synchrotron - emitting plasma to leave the vicinity of the agn , thereby favoring a steep , rather than flat or inverted , radio spectrum .",
    "this work has established that the radio emission from gh10 is compact , steep - spectrum , unpolarized , and steady .",
    "still , gh10 is known to be atypical when compared to the other gh objects , which are especially radio - quiet with @xmath10 from a stacking analysis @xcite . following those authors , by analogy with supermassive and stellar - mass black holes",
    ", a near - unity eddington ratio suggests that the low - mass black hole gh10 is presently in the very high state , with its entry into that state from the high / soft state accompanied by an optically thin ejection event in the radio . within this framework , and barring opacity effects , the radio emission from gh10 would be the slowly fading , steep - spectrum remnant from that ejection event , whose power corresponds to the quenched radio levels expected for the high / soft state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , a radio detection of only one of the 19 gh objects suggests , at face value , that such radio ejections from gh objects occur only about 5% of the time .",
    "interestingly , a 5% duty cyle resembles that established observationally for radio flares from microquasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because the low - mass black hole gh10 is radiating close to its eddington limit , it may be a local analog of the starting conditions , or seeds , for supermassive black holes . from the present work",
    ", the diameter of gh10 s radio emission must be less than 0.21 ( 320  pc ) .",
    "if gh10 is indeed driving some of this emission , then 1.4-ghz imaging with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) at a resolution of 0.005 ( 7.5  pc ) will reveal the physical connection between the black hole and the synchrotron - emitting plasma .",
    "although gh10 is a faint radio source ( table  1 ) , vlbi imaging of such sources is feasible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and would offer a means to study the relative roles of radiative versus kinetic feedback during black - hole growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gh10 was the only object detected by @xcite in their vla survey of the 19 low - mass agns discovered by @xcite .",
    "new vla imaging reveals that the emssion from gh10 has an extent of less than 320  pc , with an optically thin synchrotron spectrum that is less than 11% linearly polarized .",
    "the radio emission is steady , although poorly sampled , on timescales of weeks and years .",
    "circumnuclear star formation can not dominate the radio emission , because the inferred star formation rate , 18  @xmath0  yr@xmath3 , is inconsistent with the upper limit of 2  @xmath0  yr@xmath3 derived from the narrow optical emission lines .",
    "instead , the radio emission must be dominantly energized by the low - mass black hole , which is thought to be radiating near its eddington limit .",
    "the radio properties of gh10 strongly resemble those of the steep - spectrum cores of palomar seyfert galaxies , which feature outflow - driven emission unmodified by the effects of internal and/or external opacity .",
    "this suggest that , like those palomar seyferts , the radio emission from gh10 is outflow - driven , a suggestion that can be tested with future vlbi imaging .",
    "such imaging could also offer an opportunity to study the relative roles of radiative versus kinetic feedback during black - hole growth , given that gh10 may be a local analog of the starting conditions , or seeds , for supermassive black holes .",
    "finally , the compact , steep - spectrum , unpolarized , and steady nature of the emission from gh10 will guide future observations of the new 1.4-ghz detections of low - mass agns reported by @xcite .",
