    "in this paper we present a method to correct discrepancies which arise in the asymptotic approximation of standing wave eigenfrequencies in a thin waveguide containing cracks and different types of interface .",
    "substantial interest in the analysis of waves interacting with waveguide boundaries can be found in the literature . in acoustics and water waves , problems in periodic waveguides",
    "have been studied in @xcite , among others .",
    "bi - material structures are widely used across many engineering disciplines , ranging from film coatings to armour production . in such applications , it becomes vital to understand how waves propagate through such structures and to estimate the stresses near the crack tip which may be sufficient to cause defects to propagate , which in turn may cause failure of the entire structure @xcite .",
    "the effect that interfacial cracks and other defects have upon the behaviour of structures is a particularly active research area attracting significant attention .",
    "modelling of interfacial cracks was studied in the important early papers @xcite .",
    "the study of different types of interfaces , including ideal and non - ideal , is also widely covered in the literature , for example in @xcite , among others .",
    "recently the interaction of an interfacial crack with small impurities has been considered in the asymptotic regime in @xcite .",
    "the present paper builds upon the results of @xcite and @xcite and makes a breakthrough in improving the results in a wide range of cases that are important for applications .",
    "the former manuscript uses a weight function approach to construct an asymptotic model for out - of - plane bloch floquet wave propagation in a thin bi - material strip with an array of cracks positioned along the join .",
    "the latter considers a similar geometry , but with non - ideal interfaces lying between the cracks .",
    "both papers use a weight function approach to obtain constants describing stress distribution near the crack tips and also dervice junction conditions for an asymptotic low - dimensional model .",
    "the conditions enable dispersion diagrams to be constructed .",
    "comparison with finite element simulations demonstrate that in both the perfect and imperfect interface cases , the low dimensional model has high accuracy in the cases of the waves that propagate through the strip , usually of the order of @xmath0 , but display a larger discrepancy in the case of the standing waves .",
    "the size of this discrepancy depends greatly upon material and geometrical parameters but is typically somewhere in the region of 3 - 15% .",
    "it is this standing wave discrepancy which we aim to address in this paper , by considering the next asymptotic terms for the solution and eigenfrequencies .",
    "the structure of the present paper is as follows . in section [ section : formulation ]",
    "we present the problem formulation before developing the low dimensional model in section [ section : ldm ] .",
    "the eigenvalue correction term is derived in section [ section : omega1 ] , firstly for an elementary symmetric and homogeneous special case which is easily traceable and enables us to derive the correction term for the standing wave analytically , before considering the fully general case .",
    "we then present numerical results which demonstrate the effectiveness of the correction method in a variety of cases and comment on situations where the model fails to give useful information .",

    "when solving the low dimensional model to find the functions @xmath35 , computations display a discrepancy for standing wave eigenfrequencies between the low order model and finite element simulations of the problem ; these computations are presented in section [ section : numerics ] . in order to address the discrepancies that arise in this asymptotic model , in this paper",
    "we further consider the square of the frequency , @xmath46 , as an asymptotic quantity , writing @xmath47 it is not immediately apparent _ a priori _ that this amendment will lead to a large correction in the approximations of eigenfrequencies , but we will later see that this allows us to solve the first order low - dimensional model which causes a significant improvement in the accuracy of the model in those cases where the zero order model displays large discrepancies .",
    "interestingly , in cases where the zero order model gives high accuracy , the corrections are very small . as an example , in one case we consider in section [ section : numerics ] , the first - order correction method alters the frequency of the first standing wave ( for which the zero - order model gives a significant discrepancy ) by 11% of its zero - order value , while the propagating waves ( for which the zero - order model displays high accuracy ) are only corrected by @xmath0 .",

    "the junction conditions ( [ jncondfirst ] ) are valid for both perfect and imperfect cases , but the form of the corresponding constants @xmath75 and @xmath76 are absolutely different and come from different analysis ; this arises from the fact that the problem is singularly perturbated and so different analysis is needed in the cases @xmath23 to the case @xmath14 .",

    "it follows that in this case , the standing waves have no dependence upon the bloch - floquet parameter @xmath109 .",
    "this observation motivates us to consider the special case discussed in subsection [ section : homsym ] .",
    "applying the junction and bloch - floquet conditions for the first order equation ( [ ode1 ] ) yields the matrix equation @xmath110 here , @xmath96 is the matrix defined in ( [ m8x8 ] ) , @xmath92 and @xmath111 are the coefficients defined in ( [ columnak ] ) . since @xmath96 , is singular , this equation gives a solvability condition which will allow us to find the correction term , @xmath112 .",

    "in this section , we condsider the symmetric case in which @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "this simple case is instructive since the symmetry enables us to analytically determine the eigenfrequency of the first standing wave in an easily traceable process ; we will later make indications on how the method for the general case relates to and differs from this procedure .",
    "moreover , this eigenfrequency does not have any @xmath109-dependence as is the case for inhomogeneous setups , which enables us to easily separate the first standing wave solution from the others . in the case of the standing wave , the beams above and below the crack vibrate while the others do not ( that is , @xmath128 for @xmath53 ) .",
    "the problem formulation for the symmetric case is as follows .",
    "for the zero - order approximation , solutions satisfy ( [ ode1 ] ) with @xmath129 for all @xmath85 . to isolate the standing waves ( whose frequencies we wish to impose a correction upon ) we impose the condition @xmath130 the junction conditions for the zero order approximation then simplify to @xmath131 along with @xmath132 for @xmath58 we have that the general solution of of the zero order ldm is of the form ( [ zeroorderform ] ) with @xmath129 . applying conditions ( [ symjunction1])-([symjunction4 ] ) yields @xmath133    the first order approximation equation is of the form ( [ firstorder23 ] ) with @xmath129 .",
    "since @xmath134 are now known functions , the corresponding system consists of the two ordinary differential equations @xmath135 @xmath136 these odes have respective elementary solutions @xmath137 @xmath138 complemented by the juction conditions ( which follow from @xcite ) @xmath139 where @xmath140 if @xmath141 and @xmath142 if @xmath143 .        for the first standing wave , @xmath144 , and so applying ( [ symjunction5 ] ) with @xmath143 , @xmath145 , we see that @xmath146 applying the condition ( [ symjunction5 ] ) with @xmath141 , @xmath145 , yields the condition @xmath147 since @xmath148 is equal to the positive and negative of the same function , it must be zero , from which we deduce that @xmath149 thus , for the symmetrical case where both materials are the same , we have found an expression for the correction term @xmath150 .",
    "figure [ analyticfigure ] shows the dispersion diagram for this homogeneous , symmetric case .",
    "the red crosses on the diagram indicate the zero - order approximation ( @xmath151 ) of the eigenfrequencies , while the blue circles show the corrected first - order approximation .",
    "the black lines result from a finite element computation .",
    "the derived correction method improves the standing wave frequency discrepancy from @xmath152 to just @xmath153 .",
    "we now consider the general case in which the materials above and below the crack and interface may have different thicknesses and shear moduli .",
    "for the first order approximation , after the application of junction and bloch - floquet conditions we obtain a matrix equation of the form @xmath154 here , @xmath155 and @xmath156 are both @xmath94 matrices as defined earlier in ( [ m8x8 ] ) and ( [ n8x8 ] ) respectively whose elements depend on the bloch - floquet parameter @xmath109 and the eigenfrequency @xmath151 which is such that @xmath157 . because @xmath157 , @xmath155 has zero among its eigenvalues .",
    "we can write @xmath158 where v is a matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of @xmath155 and @xmath159 is a diagonal matrix with the respective eigenvalues of @xmath155 along the diagonal . premultiplying ( [ 1stmatrixeqn ] ) by @xmath160 , we can write @xmath161 which upon substitution of ( [ diagm ] ) becomes @xmath162 since @xmath155 is singular , it posesses zero as an eigenvalue , and so one row of the left hand side matrix in ( [ 1stmatrixeqnwithd ] ) is equal to zero .",
    "let us denote that row @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath163 all matrices and parameters in this equation are now known , with the exception of @xmath150 which can now be written in terms of known quantities : @xmath164    a potential problem with this computational method is that the matrix v may have a determinant which is close to zero when eigenvalues of @xmath155 are close together . to eliminate any possible errors arising from this , we introduce a second computational scheme for computing @xmath112 .",
    "the schur decomposition states that if @xmath9 is a @xmath165 square matrix with complex entries , then @xmath9 can be expressed in the form @xmath166 where @xmath167 is unitary and @xmath168 is upper triangular , with the eigenvalues of @xmath9 . in our case",
    ", we apply schur decomposition to the transpose of @xmath155 : @xmath169 schur decomposition is not unique ; we may place the smallest eigenvalue in the first position along the leading diagonal , and since @xmath155 is singular , this eigenvalue is zero .",
    "the first column of the upper triangular matrix @xmath168 is therefore a row of zeros . since @xmath170",
    ", we can premultiply the first order matrix equation by @xmath171 and substutite to obtain @xmath172 the first row of the left hand side is zero , whence @xmath173",
    "for our numerical calculations we will consider a strip whose elementary cell is of length @xmath174 m with an overall thickness of @xmath175 m .",
    "this geometry corresponds to a value of @xmath176 .",
    "we will compare results from the low dimensional model against those from finite element simulations ( comsol ) .",
    "we stress that finite element simulatons are efficient for comparison only in cases when the strip is not too thin , i.e. when @xmath177 is not too small .",
    "the low dimensional model , however , remains valid as @xmath178 . for our computations we vary four parameters as listed in appendix [ parametersappendix ] .",
    "these parameters are type of interface ( perfect , imperfect , highly imperfect ) , length of crack ( short , medium , long ) , materials ( iron / aluminium [ similar wavespeeds ] , magnesium / aluminium [ less similar wavespeeds ] ) and thicknesses of each material ( symmetric geometry , asymmetric geometry ) .",
    "we present in this section a number of dispersion diagrams , plotting frequency @xmath57 against the bloch - floquet parameter @xmath109 .",
    "we refer to plots of @xmath179 as the zero order approximation , and to plots of @xmath57 calculated according to ( [ asymptoticrepresentationomega ] ) as the first order approximation , or the corrected frequency .",
    "figure [ homogeneous_correction ] demonstrates the effectiveness of the method of eigenfrequency correction for the standing waves .",
    "this dispersion diagram results from computations corresponding to the case of a strip with a ` sensible ' crack length , composed of equal thicknesses of magnesium and aluminium ( materials possessing similar wave speeds ) .",
    "the diagram demonstrates that the zero order approximation agrees to a very high degree of accuracy with the finite element results in the cases of the waves which propagate through the strip ( the slanted lines ) .",
    "typically the zero order approximation for these waves eigenfrequencies differs from the finite element simulation only by around @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is clear that there is a discrepancy between the zero order model and the finite element results in the case of the standing waves ( horizontal lines on the dispersion diagram ) .",
    "the corrected first - order model retains the excellent accuracy for propagating waves , slightly increasing the accuracy while remaining of the order of @xmath0 , and hugely improves the discrepancy of the standing wave frequencies . while the correction is not completely uniform since the standing waves frequencies depend upon @xmath109 except in the case where materials have _ identical _ wavespeeds , a typical discrepancy for the first standing wave has decreased from 3.9% to 0.38% .",
    "this can be considered as a surprisingly large correction , since there is no reason _ a priori _ to suspect that considering @xmath57 as an asymptotic quantity should cause such an improvement in the accuracy of the low dimensional model s approximation of the standing wave frequency .",
    "the dispersion diagrams for the cases with short and long crack lengths , again with materials of similar wave speeds , perfect interfaces and the same thicknesses of both material are contained within figure [ longshort ] .",
    "as one would expect , the length of the crack does not significantly alter the eigenfrequencies of those waves that propagate through the strip ( again the correction is on the level of @xmath0 ) , since they are not strongly influenced by the presence of the crack . in similar agreement with physical intuition ,",
    "the first standing wave for the long crack is of much lower frequency than in the geometry housing the particularly short crack .",
    "the correction offered by the first order approach is relatively small in the long crack case , but since the zero order model in this case already gave good accuracy with only a 1.3% discrepancy for the first standing wave , this is not surprising .",
    "the corrected eigenfrequency of this wave agrees with finite element results to within @xmath180 .",
    "this can be seen as a surprisingly effective correction since in the long crack geometry , the crack tips are close to the ends of the elementary cell .",
    "this gives the boundary layers surrounding the crack tips a small area in which to decay so that they do not influence the bloch - floquet conditions .    in the case of the short crack",
    ", the zero order approximation of the first standing wave eigenfrequency is easily seen to be significantly different to the true value found in the finite element simulation , with a 12.2% discrepancy .",
    "after applying the correction method , the discrepancy decreases to 0.95% .",
    "the standing wave dispersion diagrams for a strip of aluminium and magnesium are presented in figure [ diffmaterials ] , for both the symmetrical and asymmetrical cases .",
    "the correction is largest , as is the zero order discrepancy , in the symmetrical case .",
    "the correction in the case of materials with different wave speeds is less uniform than in the al - mg case ; this can be readily seen in the highest frequency standing wave shown in the left hand subfigure of figure [ diffmaterials ] .",
    "the correction still offers a significant improvement in most cases , however , although it is harder to quantify the exact size of a typical discrepancy .",
    "the results in the case of the imperfect interface analogue follow broadly the same qualitative pattern as in the perfect interface case .",
    "the left hand subfigure of figure [ imperfect_figure ] gives the dispersion diagram for an iron - aluminium strip , joined with a thin layer of epoxy resin adhesive . due to the different wavespeeds , the sizes of the standing wave corrections are dependent on the bloch - floquet parameter @xmath109 , but in most cases the correction gives a significant improvement in accuracy",
    "an interesting phenomenon can be observed when eigenvalues are close to each other in this subfigure ; a zoomed section of the dispersion diagram to illustrate this is given in figure [ zoomed ] .",
    "in figure [ zoomed ] , some of the circles have been replaced by squares ; these are the points which approximated propagating waves in the zero - order model which are corrected to approximate the standing waves for some values of @xmath109 .",
    "in doing so , a crossing - over phenomenon occurs , where the order of eigenfrequencies switches after correction .",
    "the phenomenon becomes more pronounced at higher frequencies .",
    "the right hand figure of figure [ imperfect_figure ] corresponds to a case where the materials are bonded in a highly imperfect fashion , using an adhesive with a shear modulus just a tenth that of the epoxy resin whose parameters are given in appendix [ materialconsts ] ( i.e. a material with shear modulus @xmath181 and mass density @xmath182 ) .",
    "this subfigure serves the purpose of presenting a case in which the low dimensional model ceases to provide _ entirely useful _ approximations . here",
    "the finite element simulation displays qualitatively different features which the low dimensional model does not predict at all .",
    "the fact that the low dimensional model breaks down is not surprising ; in fact , the manuscript @xcite derives a condition on @xmath13 for the analysis on which the low dimensional model is based to be valid .",
    "the key point of this condition is that if @xmath13 is too large , the boundary layers @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see equation ( [ uansatzold ] ) on page ) decay sufficiently slowly for the assumption that they are independent to cease to hold .",
    "moreover , if the boundary layers decay slowly from the crack tip , the bloch - floquet conditions will be influenced by the boundary layers .",
    "this case is interesting in itself and requires separate analysis .",
    "this phenomenon has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the comparisons between the low dimensional model and the finite element simulations demonstrate that the proposed method of eigenfrequency correction is highly effective in most cases , typically improving accuracy for the standing wave eigenfrequency by an order of magnitude . moreover , the correction itself is computationally very efficient .",
    "the correction becomes less uniform for materials with significantly different wave speeds , improving the accuracy by different amounts in different parts of the dispersion diagram , and misses qualitative features for setups with highly imperfect interfaces .",
    "practically , however , such highly imperfect interfaces are unlikely to be encountered .",
    "fracture parameters are not affected by the analysis and for that reason are omitted in this paper and refer the reader to @xcite , where discussions and details relating to these parameters can be found .",
    "we only underline here that sif ( in the perfect interface case ) or cod ( in the imperfect interface case ) can be constructed as functionals on the low dimensional model without further work .",
    "for that reason , the results of this paper are of additional importance .",
