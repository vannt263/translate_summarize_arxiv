    "flavour singlet pseudoscalar states bear witness to the topological structure of the qcd vacuum and hence constitute objects of great physical interest . in lattice gauge theory ,",
    "considerable progress has been achieved recently  @xcite in directly accessing such @xmath5 like states from their propagators in @xmath3 qcd with wilson fermion action , based on applying spectral approximations to two - loop correlators ( hairpin diagrams ) .    in this note , we extend this work to the more realistic setting of partially quenched qcd with two active sea quark flavours , where valence and sea quarks are allowed to carry different masses . in our comprehensive study we analyzed some 800 independent sesam configurations on @xmath8 lattices at @xmath9  @xcite , with four different sea quark masses , as indicated in fig.[fig : operational ]  .",

    "as it has not been possible to determine the effective constant @xmath6 in the past we explore the potential of our data for achieving progress on this issue by applying our spectral techniques  @xcite in two steps .      in a first attempt , we choose @xmath25 and study effective mass gaps as determined from the hairpin diagrams , @xmath26 , by fitting , w.r.t .",

    "[ eq : form ] to our data . in broken su(3 ) with two active quark flavours , we introduce two isosinglet pseudoscalars , designated by the indices @xmath29 ( for ` light ' , nonstrange ) and @xmath22 ( for strange ) . in this manner , we can study three types of hairpin diagrams , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , with the strange quark mass determined on the lattice from the kaon mass ( for @xmath33 locations , see fig.1 ) . as a result , we find satisfying plateau formations in @xmath34 as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : plateau_signal ] .",
    "in fact , the numerical quality of our signals comfortably allows for the consecutive extrapolations _ ( i ) _ to light valence and then _ ( ii ) _ to light sea quark masses ; the chiral sea quark extrapolation is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral_signal ] .      from the consecutive chiral extrapolations , we obtain for the quadratic mass matrix in the quark - flavour basis @xmath35 where @xmath36 . with the @xmath37-meson mass scale",
    "@xcite we find @xmath38 diagonalization of @xmath39 renders @xmath40 these numbers from @xmath3 look promising : the individual mass values  while being low _ w.r.t . _ the real three flavour world  yield a mass splitting that compares very well to phenomenology .",
    "we remark that the outcome of the analysis at this stage is not in accord with the tree approximation to the lagrangian , eq .",
    "[ eq : lagr ] , as the latter predicts the mass plateaus to be _ independent _ of the valence quark mass , @xmath41 , contrary to the findings in fig .",
    "[ fig : plateau_signal ] .",
    "therefore , we repeated the above mass plateau study on a set of nonvanishing @xmath6-parameters , in an attempt to verify the compliance of our data with such independence : inspecting the plot of @xmath42 vs. @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : minimize ] ) it becomes obvious _",
    "( i ) _ that @xmath43 shows a simple , linear behaviour and _ ( ii ) _ that @xmath6 can indeed be adjusted to produce a zero slope of @xmath43  ] !    in this way it is straightforward to find an optimal value , @xmath44 , that eliminates ( for a given sea quark mass ) the @xmath41-dependence from @xmath42 , resulting in a universal plateau level .",
    "this collapse of data into universal plateaus ( of heights @xmath45 ) is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : universal ] .",
    "the comparision with the situation encountered with @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plateau_signal ] ) provides clear evidence for our sensitivity in determining @xmath44 .",
    "after chiral sea quark extrapolation we arrive at the values @xmath46 note that the numerical value for the mass gap _ at the chiral point _ is robust w.r.t . to the two different approaches presented here .",
    "one might say that the allowance for the @xmath6 parameter anticipates the chiral valence quark limits .      in conclusion :",
    "the application of spectral methods to the hairpin diagrams allows rather detailed partially quenched studies in the flavour singlet sector , with standard wilson fermions .",
