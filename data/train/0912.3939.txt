    "in an earlier paper @xcite we showed that two two - level atoms placed in a pumped high - q cavity with normal weakly lossy mirrors will not have sustained entanglement in the case of closed two - level systems , but may have such entanglement in the case of open two - level systems .",
    "our treatment included cavity leakage and spontaneous emission .",
    "it assumed that the q - factor of the cavity was large enough so that the vacuum rabi splitting was larger than any of the decay rates of the system .",
    "this allowed us to express the system in terms of the atom - field dressed state picture .",
    "the coherence of the system was built into the dressed states allowing us to treat the effects of cavity losses and spontaneous emission in terms of simple incoherent transitions between these dressed states .",
    "the advantage of expressing the system in the dressed state basis is that we can immediately see within which manifold the entanglement between the atoms lies , and tailor our system to maximize the population in that manifold .",
    "due to experimental advances in atomic traps and cavity qed @xcite it is within our technological limits to trap and manipulate individual atoms inside a microcavity to study their entanglement behavior . as a result , more attention",
    "is directed towards the entanglement of atoms and fields within these cavities @xcite .",
    "more specifically , to determine the conditions in which atoms can get entangled in these system , and to characterize the states of these entangled atoms .",
    "one of the interesting things to note in open systems , such as the one we describe in this paper , is that it allows the possibility of steady - state entanglement @xcite without the assistance of post - selection .",
    "the intuition gained from the dressed - state formalism suggested that the addition of a nonlinear mirror to the cavity might allow the production of steady - state entanglement even in the case of closed two - level systems . in this paper",
    ", we will demonstrate the possibility of steady - state entanglement between two atoms by employing a nonlinear mirror to construct the cavity .",
    "the nonlinearity we are interested in is the reverse - saturated absorption ( rsa ) property of the mirror @xcite which offers a larger cavity photon loss at greater intra - cavity field intensities .",
    "the rsa mirror effectively changes the photon number distribution in the cavity which will preferentially sustain the low photon number states which in turn means a larger population in the lower manifolds of the dressed states of the system we consider .",
    "this concentration of population in the lower manifolds yields the entanglement between the two atoms in the cavity .    here",
    "we will investigate the steady - state entanglement of two two - level atoms inside a pumped high - q cavity with a nonlinear mirror .",
    "we express the state of the two atoms as a mixed state in the dressed state basis in which the weighting factors are determined by constructing rate equations governing the steady - state population in each of the dressed states .",
    "this is justified by assuming that the vacuum rabi splitting is much larger than any decay parameter of the system @xcite .",
    "we will show that only the @xmath0 manifold of the dressed states contribute to the entanglement of the system , and how the employment of a nonlinear mirror can help generate entanglement between the two two - level atoms inside the cavity .",
    "the system we are considering consists of two atoms , each with energy structure shown in fig.([system ] ) , in a cavity which is externally pumped on resonance with the atomic transition and the cavity . the system can lose energy through cavity leakage or through spontaneous emission of the atoms . however",
    ", unlike ref.@xcite , we will take the output mirror to be a nonlinear mirror such that the power transmission coefficient , @xmath1 , is a function of the number of photons in the cavity .",
    "two two - level atoms inside a cavity , width=288 ]    we assume the cavity has a high q - factor such that the vacuum rabi splitting is much larger than the spontaneous decay rate and the cavity leakage rate . the large rabi splitting justifies the use of the rate equations with respect to the dressed states for our system .",
    "since we wish to characterize this system using rate equations , we will need the dressed states of the closed system , and calculate the transition rates between these dressed states . from this we will construct the rate equation and determine the mixed state density matrix of the two atoms in the cavity .",
    "the hamiltonian of the closed system in the interaction picture is    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the atomic transition operator for the @xmath4 atom and @xmath5 is the field creation operator . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we will assume the coupling constants , @xmath6 , to be the same for each atom .",
    "in the case in which there is only one excitation in the system there are three essential states ,    @xmath7    and three dressed states ,    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    here @xmath11 indicates the first atom is in state @xmath12 , the second atom in state @xmath13 , and the field in state @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 excitation of the system will have a different set of dressed states since there are four essential states in this case .",
    "the four essential states for @xmath15 are ,    @xmath16    the dressed states are then given by ,    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19 , @xmath0 , and @xmath20 dressed state as ,    @xmath21    with    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the population of the ground state of the system , @xmath24 is the population in the @xmath25 dressed states , @xmath26 is the population in the @xmath27 dressed state , @xmath28 is the population in @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the population in the @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the population in @xmath33 .",
    "the einstein a coefficient of the @xmath34 transition of the single atom in free space is given by @xmath35 , the single photon pumping rate inside the cavity is given by @xmath36 , and the power transmission coefficient of the cavity output mirror as a function of the number of photons in the cavity is given by @xmath37 .",
    "here we assume that there is no population initially in the @xmath27 and @xmath31 dressed states , and because these states do not couple to any other states , they will not accumulate any population at later times .",
    "as mentioned in ref.@xcite , truncating the rate equation to @xmath20 will over - estimate the entanglement content between the two atoms since there will be some population beyond the @xmath20 manifold that does not directly decay down to the @xmath0 manifold . to correct for this",
    ", we will go one step further to obtain @xmath38 and @xmath39 in order to determine what fraction of the @xmath15 population lies in the @xmath20 manifold . to simplify the equations",
    ", we will assume @xmath40 for @xmath41 , and express @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",
    "here @xmath44 is the measure of nonlinearity in the mirror since it tells us how much more ( or less ) the cavity transmits depending on the intra - cavity field intensity .",
    "the equations for @xmath38 and @xmath39 are then given by ,    @xmath45    solving the above equations in the steady - state we get ,    @xmath46    to determine the fraction of population in the @xmath20 manifold within the @xmath47 manifolds we have to solve the equations ,    @xmath48    substituting the expressions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the above equations we get ,    @xmath49    this suggests that the rate equations for the dressed states should be modified to ,    @xmath50    where we have replaced @xmath51 and @xmath52 by @xmath53 and @xmath54 to reflect the true population decay of the @xmath20 manifold .",
    "the steady - state solution to these rate equations is ,    @xmath55    where we have defined the normalization constant ,    @xmath56    we now want to investigate the entanglement between the two atoms in the cavity .",
    "to do this we trace out the field component of the density matrix and obtain the reduced density matrix of just the two atoms .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the two atoms is given by ,    @xmath57    where    @xmath58    in order to calculate the entanglement content we employ wootters concurrence @xcite which is defined as ,    @xmath59    where @xmath60 are the eigenvalues , in descending order of value , of the matrix @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the concurrence of @xmath63 is given by ,    @xmath64^{\\frac{1}{2}},0\\big).\\ ] ]    we have shown in ref.@xcite that in the case of a linear mirror ( @xmath65 ) there is no combination of parameters which yields a nonzero concurrence .",
    "would an @xmath66 yield a nonzero concurrence ? to answer this question , first we note that the three dressed @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and , @xmath69 have no entanglement ( i.e @xmath70 ) between the atoms .",
    "the only manifold in the dressed state picture which offers a nonzero entanglement between the atoms is the @xmath0 manifold dressed states @xmath25 with @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , it stands to reason that we would want to put as much population in the @xmath0 manifold as possible . in order to put more population in the @xmath0 manifold",
    "we would require @xmath72 .",
    "this means that the cavity experiences a larger loss of photons for higher intra - cavity intensities .",
    "one possible way to do this would be to incorporate a reverse saturable absorber in the cavity @xcite .",
    "we can see in fig.([cploteta10]-[cploteta12 ] ) how the entanglement between the two atoms is affected by the pump rate and the photon leakage rate ( both expressed in units of @xmath35 ) with different values of @xmath44 .",
    "it is clear that as we increase the value of @xmath44 , the maximum value of the plot rises .",
    "we start seeing a nonzero value of concurrence at @xmath73 .",
    "however , it seems that one would need @xmath74 to be able to see entanglement between the atoms for any realistic system .",
    "this would mean that we require a nonlinearity such that a two - photon state of the cavity will decay at a rate which is ten times faster than that of a single photon state of the cavity .",
    "plot of c against @xmath36 and @xmath1 ( in units of @xmath35 ) , @xmath44=10.,width=480 ]     plot of c against @xmath36 and @xmath1 ( in units of @xmath35),@xmath44=12.,width=403 ]",
    "we have derived the steady - state reduced density matrix for two spontaneously decaying two - level atoms inside a high - q cavity which is pumped and experiences photon leakage through a rsa mirror . in our model we assumed that the vacuum rabi splitting is much larger than any decay parameter in the system which allows us to express the density matrix of the system as a mixture of the dressed states of the system with a weighting factor that is determined by the rate equations of these dressed states . we show that the atoms in the system can get entangled in the steady - state by choosing @xmath44 , the nonlinearity parameter , to be greater than one .",
    "therefore , employing reverse saturable mediums can , in principle , entangle two two - level atoms inside a high - q cavity in our model ."
