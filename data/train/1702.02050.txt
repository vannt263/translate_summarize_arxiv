    "coronal holes are the lowest density regions in the solar atmosphere . their low density and temperature as compared to the ambient corona results in a reduced emission in the extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) and soft x - ray ( sxr ) .",
    "therefore , they appear as dark structures in euv images , and are often identified by intensity based thresholding techniques ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , coronal holes are typically characterized by a large amount of `` open '' magnetic flux , i.e. , magnetic flux which closes at far distances to the sun .",
    "the open magnetic flux of coronal holes expands rapidly above the bottom of coronal holes due to the low ambient pressure and the low plasma - to - magnetic pressure ratio @xmath3 . at a distance between about 1  r@xmath4 and 10  r@xmath4 above the solar - photosphere surface",
    ", plasma is accelerated along the open magnetic field lines to form high - speed solar wind streams , i.e. , supersonic plasma flows which transverse our solar system ( e.g.   review by * ? ? ?",
    "high - speed solar wind streams are the major cause of minor and medium geomagnetic storms at earth .",
    "the peak velocity of high - speed streams measured at l1 is correlated to the inverse expansion factor of the rapidly expanding magnetic flux tubes of coronal holes evaluated between the lower boundary of coronal holes and the source - surface at 2.5  r@xmath4 as derived by potential - field source - surface ( pfss ) extrapolations @xcite .",
    "in addition , the peak velocity of high - speed streams correlates with the ratio of the mean magnetic field density of the photosphere below a ch to its flux tube expansion factor , and with the area of the coronal hole @xcite .    for these reasons ,",
    "the magnetic field distribution in coronal holes is of high interest . @xcite and @xcite studied the evolution of the mean magnetic field densities of coronal holes over the solar cycle .",
    "they found that the mean magnetic field densities at solar minimum are about , respectively , and that they are 3 - 5 times higher at solar maximum .",
    "@xcite studied the magnetic characteristics over the life time of coronal holes .",
    "they report that the mean magnetic field densities of coronal holes decrease with their age .",
    "@xcite studied 12 well pronounced coronal holes in comparison to quiet sun regions .",
    "they report that the relative amount of the total signed magnetic flux to the total unsigned magnetic flux in their coronal holes under study is , i.e.  that most of the magnetic flux in coronal holes is open .",
    "however , these authors also report that a significant number of closed magnetic loops exists within coronal holes .",
    "they have shown that short and low - lying coronal loops are almost as abundant in coronal holes as in quiet sun regions , whereas high and long loops are very rare .",
    "pfss extrapolations confirmed that the global magnetic field in coronal holes is predominantly unipolar , open , and expands super - radially with height , whereby the flux tube expansion factor is highest at the boundary of coronal holes and smallest near the center ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported that the flux tube expansion factor derived at the source - surface , the mean magnetic field density at the base , and the area at the base of the coronal hole depend on each other .",
    "furthermore , they found that the mean magnetic field density derived at the source - surface at 2.5  r@xmath4 correlates well with the area at the base of coronal holes .    correlating the force - free extrapolated magnetic field at different altitudes of coronal holes with doppler - velocity maps derived from si@xmath5 , c@xmath6 and ne@xmath7 spectral lines",
    ", @xcite found that the solar wind plasma flows out in magnetic funnels at heights between above the photosphere .",
    "@xcite showed that the outflow velocity is statistically higher at higher underlying photospheric magnetic field strengths .",
    "finally , @xcite showed by spectroscopic observations of the ne@xmath7 line in a polar coronal hole that high - speed solar wind streams are rooted near the supergranulation boundaries in the chromospheric network lanes below coronal holes .    in this paper",
    ", we give a comprehensive statistical overview over 288 records of low - latitude coronal holes detected in euv images in the time range 2011/01/01 to 2013/12/31 , i.e.  from the rising phase of solar cycle 24 up to the solar maximum .",
    "note that solar maxima , as inferred from the sunspot numbers , tend to be double - peaked @xcite ; the first peak of solar cycle 24 appeared in march , 2012 corresponding to the northern solar hemisphere and the second , slightly larger peak in april , 2014 corresponding to the southern hemisphere .",
    "our dataset contains all the coronal holes detected at a cadence of one image per day with areas greater than and center of mass situated within around the intersection of the solar equator and the central meridian .",
    "the coronal holes were allowed to expand beyond the restriction , but equatorial extensions of polar coronal holes are not included .",
    "we divided this paper into three main parts .",
    "the first part presents the distribution of characteristic observational properties of the low - latitude coronal holes , such as their areas , the mean euv intensity , mean magnetic field densities , the mean unsigned magnetic field densities , the unbalanced magnetic flux , and the percentage unbalanced magnetic flux , i.e.  the relative amount of the total signed to total unsigned magnetic flux .",
    "we investigate their correlations , and examine the difference in the statistics between small and large coronal holes .",
    "most notably , we find a strong dependency between the mean magnetic field density , the mean unsigned magnetic field density , and the percentage unsigned magnetic flux of coronal holes .",
    "in the second part , we investigate the distribution of the aia-193 intensity and the magnetic field density within coronal holes , in particular the probability distribution of the aia-193 intensity along a normalized cross - section of coronal holes , the magnetic polarity of coronal holes at various magnetic levels , and the amount of unbalanced magnetic flux that arises from various magnetic levels .",
    "we find that the magnetic field distributions at various magnetic levels of a coronal hole always have the same polarity , and that most of the unbalanced magnetic flux arises from only a small percentage of its area .    in the third part , we present magnetic flux tubes as the origin of the unbalanced magnetic flux of coronal holes .",
    "we investigate the distribution of magnetic flux tubes within coronal holes , and relate the averaged properties of magnetic flux tubes within coronal holes to the overall magnetic properties of coronal holes .",
    "we find strong dependencies between the mean magnetic field density and unbalanced magnetic flux of the flux tubes , of the coronal hole region without the flux tubes , and of the magnetic properties of the overall coronal hole .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section [ dataset ] describes the dataset and the data reduction , section [ analysis ] the analysis methods .",
    "section [ stchardis ] studies the distribution of characteristic observational properties of the low - latitude coronal holes .",
    "section [ pxdist ] presents the local distribution of the euv intensity and the magnetic field within the coronal holes .",
    "section [ flxtb ] studies the distribution and properties of magnetic flux tubes within the coronal holes .",
    "section [ correlateftch ] relates the averaged parameters of magnetic flux tubes to the overall magnetic properties of the coronal holes .",
    "section [ discussion ] discusses the results .",
    "we use euv filtergrams recorded by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on - board of the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) , low noise line - of - sight magnetograms recorded by the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) on - board of sdo and provided by the joint science operations center ( jsoc ) , and h@xmath8 images from the kanzelhhe observatory of solar and environmental research .    to identify coronal holes in euv images , we use aia filtergrams .",
    "because of their high contrast between coronal holes and quiet sun regions , these filtergrams are often used to identify coronal holes in euv images by various segmentation techniques ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the aia filtergrams observe emission from fe xii ions in the coronal plasma at a temperature of about ( peak response ) .",
    "images are taken by a @xmath9 pixel ccd camera , the spatial resolution is at a plate scale of @xcite .    to study the photospheric magnetic field below coronal holes , we use the hmi - los 720s magnetogram dataset .",
    "this magnetogram data product is a low noise line - of - sight magnetogram data product derived by the vector camera of the hmi instrument .",
    "we prefer this data product to the hmi vector magnetograms due to its much higher signal - to - noise ratio at weak magnetic fields .",
    "the vector camera derives the stoke s parameters for the full solar disk from the photospheric fe i line ( ) .",
    "ten sets of stoke s parameters recorded at a cadence of are then averaged to derive the line - of - sight magnetic field .",
    "the plate scale is at @xmath9 pixels , the spatial resolution is , and the noise level is .",
    "note that the noise level primarily arises from photon noise , and therefore decreases with @xmath10 by averaging over @xmath11 pixels @xcite .    to distinguish coronal holes from filaments , we use h@xmath8 filtergrams taken by kanzelhhe observatory .",
    "the h@xmath8 filtergrams observe emission from neutral hydrogen in the chromosphere at the center of the h@xmath8 line ( ) with a fwhm of .",
    "the images are recorded by a @xmath12 pixel ccd camera at a plate scale of @xcite .",
    "all images were normalized to an exposure time of , rotated to north up , and interpolated to a spatial sampling of at @xmath13 pixels .",
    "the interpolation to @xmath13 pixels was performed under the condition of conservation of flux , and reduces the noise level of the line - of - sight magnetograms to about per pixel .",
    "due to the different recording times of the aia-193 , hmi - los , and h@xmath8 images , the magnetograms and h@xmath8 images were co - aligned assuming rigid rotation of the sun to match the recording time of the aia-193 images .",
    "the maximum time of de - rotation was for magnetograms and for h@xmath8 images .",
    "since h@xmath8 images are only used for the visual identification of filaments , the error in the de - rotation of h@xmath8 images by assuming rigid rotation over can be neglected .",
    "two species of structures appear dark in euv images : coronal holes and filaments .",
    "coronal holes are the lowest density structures in the sun s corona at comparably low coronal temperatures of about .",
    "therefore they appear as dark structures in euv images , but are not visible in h@xmath8 images . in contrast , filaments have a high density , a chromospheric temperature of about , extending from the sun s chromosphere to the lower corona .",
    "filaments appear dark in both euv and h@xmath8 images .    to create our dataset , we first extracted all dark structures in euv images for the 3-year - period under study from 2011/01/01 to 2013/12/31 with a cadence of one image per day",
    ". then we visually classify and exclude filaments within the dark structures by comparison with h@xmath8 images .",
    "the dataset is restricted by the availability of euv images , h@xmath8 images and magnetograms , and covers of the time range under study .",
    "we extracted the dark structures in the euv images by an intensity - based thresholding algorithm based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the threshold was set to 0.35 times the median of the aia-193 intensity of the solar disk .",
    "the resulting full disk binary maps of dark structures were post - processed by morphological operators ( erosion and dilation ) , whereby a median function with a kernel of 9 pixels was applied .",
    "this morphological operation adds small bright islands within coronal holes to the area of coronal holes , and removes very small dark structures , which are most probably neither coronal holes nor filaments , from the full - disk binary map @xcite . in order to obtain the single structure binary maps the full disk binary maps were segmented .",
    "two structures were recognized as individual structures as soon as they are separated by at least one pixel .",
    "finally , the euv images and magnetograms of the single structures were obtained by cutting the full - disk euv images and magnetograms according to the single structure binary maps identified in the euv .    for further analysis",
    ", we restricted the single structure dataset to structures with an area of more than @xmath14 km@xmath15 corresponding to a minimum diameter of , and with an angular distance of the structure s center of mass to the intersection of the solar equator and central meridian of less than in order to reduce the effects of projection in the further analysis .",
    "thus , we arrive at a resulting dataset of 343 structures .",
    "figure [ statistics17 ] shows an example of the segmentation procedure and resulting coronal holes .",
    "the remaining single structures identified in euv were then divided into coronal holes and filaments by visual comparison with the h@xmath8 images . since filament channels are sometimes visible in euv before the corresponding channel is visible in h@xmath8 , i.e.  before the channel is filled with dense cool plasma , we inspected the h@xmath8 images within a time range of @xmath16 days .",
    "if the full structure was visible in the h@xmath8 images within a time range @xmath16 days , the structure was labelled as filament .",
    "if only a part of the structure was visible in h@xmath8 , the structure was excluded from further analysis . if the structure was not visible in h@xmath8 , but had an elongated shape and a balanced magnetic flux like we expect it from filaments , the structure was also excluded from further analysis .",
    "all structures remaining were labelled as coronal holes .",
    "in total , our dataset includes 288 records of dark structures that were identified as coronal holes .",
    "49 dark structures which were identified as filaments , and 6 dark structures which could not be uniquely assigned , were excluded from further analysis .",
    "we analysed the distribution of characteristic properties in the coronal hole dataset , i.e.  the areas , latitudes of the center of mass , the mean euv intensities , the mean value and skewness of the distribution of the radial magnetic field in the photosphere , and the magnetic flux .",
    "we denote a pixel within a coronal hole as @xmath17 , its projected area as @xmath18 , its aia-193 intensity as @xmath19 , its heliographic latitude as @xmath20 , its line - of - sight magnetic field density as @xmath21 , and the total number of pixels within the coronal hole as @xmath11 .",
    "first , in order to avoid systematic errors due to the different latitudes of the coronal holes , we presume the magnetic field to be radial and correct each pixel for projection effects : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the heliographic angular distance of the pixel to the center of the solar disk as seen from sdo .",
    "then , for each coronal hole , we calculated the projection - corrected area @xmath24 , the latitude of its center of mass @xmath25 , and the mean euv - intensity in the filtergrams @xmath26 .",
    "further , we calculated the projection - corrected unbalanced magnetic flux @xmath27 , the total unsigned magnetic flux @xmath28 , and the percentaged unbalanced magnetic flux @xmath29 , by @xmath30 the unbalanced magnetic flux gives the magnetic flux which is not closed _ within _ the coronal hole . under the standard assumption that only magnetic flux near the border of the coronal hole closes with neighbouring regions , the unbalanced magnetic flux is a reasonable estimate of the open magnetic flux .",
    "the percentage unbalanced magnetic flux gives the percentage of magnetic flux which is not closed within the coronal hole .",
    "finally , we calculated the projection - corrected mean magnetic field density @xmath31 and the projection - corrected mean unsigned magnetic field density @xmath32 in the photosphere below the coronal hole , @xmath33 and the skewness skew(@xmath34 ) of the magnetic field distribution . in our context",
    "the skewness is a measure of the distinctness of a dominant polarity .",
    "whereas in section [ analysischarpars ] we analyse the distribution of characteristic properties of coronal holes , here we analyse the distribution of aia-193 and magnetogram pixels _ within _ the coronal holes . to do so , we calculate for each coronal hole a normalized histogram .",
    "then , we stack the normalized histograms of all coronal holes , whereby all histograms are weighted equally , i.e.  small coronal holes get the same weight as large coronal holes .",
    "the projection of the stacked histograms gives us a median representation of the histograms and a @xmath35 and a @xmath36 range in which the histograms lie , i.e.  a probability distribution of the histograms .",
    "this approach provides us with a characterisation of the average pixel distribution within all coronal holes under study .",
    "first we analysed the distribution of the euv intensity within coronal holes .",
    "for each coronal hole we created a histogram of the pixels of the aia-193 intensity @xmath19 , and normalized the histograms by their total number of pixels to obtain for each coronal hole the percentage of pixels belonging to each intensity bin .",
    "then we calculated separately from all coronal holes the median value and the @xmath35 and @xmath36 ranges of the percentages of pixels for each intensity bin .",
    "next we analysed the euv intensities along the major axis of coronal holes .",
    "first we calculated the direction of the major axis by using a least - square fit on the longitude - latitude tupels of all pixels of the coronal hole .",
    "we calculated the length of all cross - section parallel to the derived direction to get the longest cross - section , which we denote as major axis .",
    "we define the width of the coronal hole as the number of pixels along the longest cut perpendicular to the major axis .",
    "the aia-193 intensity along the major axis was then derived by averaging over of the width of the coronal hole perpendicular to major axis . for each coronal hole",
    "we derived the aia-193 intensity versus the position along the normalized major axis .",
    "we then calculated from all coronal holes the representative median aia-193 intensity and the @xmath35 and @xmath36 ranges for the normalized positions along the major axis .",
    "further we analysed the distribution of the magnetic field densities within coronal holes .",
    "since the dominant polarity of coronal holes can be positive or negative , we transform the magnetic field densities @xmath37 within a coronal hole so that positive values always belong to the dominant polarity of the coronal hole : @xmath38 for each coronal hole we created a histogram of @xmath39 .",
    "next , we analysed the distinctiveness of the dominant polarity at various magnetic field density levels within coronal holes .",
    "we define the magnetic flux arising from a given signed magnetic field density level @xmath40 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 corresponds to the binning of the magnetic field density values @xmath39 .",
    "then , we denote the fraction of the magnetic flux arising from a given magnetic field density level @xmath40 which has the same polarity as the overall coronal hole as the polarity dominance @xmath43 of the magnetic field density level @xmath40 , @xmath44 a polarity dominance of @xmath45 means that the magnetic flux arising from the magnetic field density level @xmath40 is balanced , whereas a polarity dominance of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) corresponds to an unipolar magnetic flux arising from the magnetic field density level @xmath40 with the same ( opposite ) polarity as the overall coronal hole .    finally , we analysed the fraction of the unbalanced magnetic flux @xmath27 of a coronal hole that arises from all pixels above a given threshold magnetic field density @xmath48 , @xmath49 : @xmath50      we investigated the characteristics of magnetic flux tubes within each coronal hole .",
    "we extracted the magnetic flux tubes by a thresholding technique on the magnetograms of the coronal holes at different global thresholds of @xmath51 , @xmath52 : first all pixels in the magnetogram with @xmath53 were set to not a number ( nan ) .",
    "each island remaining within the magnetograms is defined as a magnetic flux tube .",
    "the resulting magnetogram was segmented , whereby two flux tubes were identified as individual flux tubes as soon as they are separated by at least one pixel .",
    "note that the flux tubes extracted and their parameters derived depend on the magnetic extraction threshold @xmath54 .    for each flux tube extracted at a threshold @xmath54",
    "we calculated the following parameters : its projection - corrected area @xmath55 , its projection - corrected mean magnetic field density @xmath56 , and its projection - corrected magnetic flux @xmath57 ( cf .",
    "[ analysischarpars ] ) .    for each coronal hole",
    "we counted the number of flux tubes @xmath58 .",
    "we calculated the total area @xmath59 of the coronal hole that is covered by flux tubes , their summed unbalanced magnetic flux @xmath60 , their summed total unsigned magnetic flux @xmath61 , and their averaged magnetic field density @xmath62 , by summing ( averaging ) over all pixels which belong to magnetic flux tubes extracted at a given threshold @xmath54 : @xmath63    in addition , we calculated the mean magnetic field density of the coronal hole without the flux tubes , which we denote as `` quiet '' coronal hole regions : @xmath64 where a is the area of the coronal hole .    finally , for each coronal hole we estimated the fraction of the magnetic flux arising from all flux tubes which is unbalanced , i.e.  the percentage unbalanced magnetic flux of the flux tubes @xmath65 note that under condition of similar absolute unbalanced magnetic fluxes @xmath66 of the flux tubes , @xmath67 is also an estimate on the number of flux tubes which are open and on the number of flux tubes which are closed loops .",
    "an overview on all properties defined is given in table [ definitionattributes ] .",
    "in this section , we present the statistics of characteristic properties of the 288 records of low - latitude coronal holes from 2011/01/01 to 2013/12/31 . in particular , we present the area , the latitude , the mean aia-193 intensity , the mean magnetic field density , the mean unsigned magnetic field density , the skewness of magnetic field distribution , the unbalanced magnetic flux , and the percentage unbalanced magnetic flux .",

    "figure [ statistics1]b shows the heliographic latitudes @xmath25 of the center of mass of coronal holes versus their areas @xmath24 . in the time range under study large coronal holes appeared predominantly on the northern hemisphere , whereas small and medium sized coronal holes appeared at both hemispheres .",
    "figure [ statistics1]c shows the latitudes @xmath25 of the center of mass of coronal holes versus their percentaged unbalanced magnetic flux @xmath29 , which corresponds to their magnetic polarity . in the time range under study ,",
    "i.e.  the rising phase of solar cycle 24 up to solar maximum , coronal holes appeared with both polarities in each of the two hemispheres at almost all times .",
    "this can be explained by the reversal of the magnetic polarity of polar coronal holes during the time range under study .",
    "coronal holes with a small percentage of unbalanced magnetic flux , i.e.  a weakly pronounced polarity , only appeared near the solar equator , with a medium percentage of unbalanced magnetic flux at all latitudes , and with a high percentage of unbalanced magnetic flux only at some distance to the solar equator .",

    "it seems unlikely that this difference is only due to the different selection of the datasets .",
    "we think that the low mean magnetic field densities of our low latitude coronal holes examined near solar maximum is related to the weak polar magnetic field strength in the solar minimum before solar cycle 24 and the very low solar activity in the actual solar cycle 24 ( e.g.  review by * ? ? ?",
    "however , also instrumental effects of the different magnetographs used by the different authors can not be excluded .",
    "the characteristic parameters of coronal holes , i.e.  the areas , the mean aia-193 intensities , and the magnetic parameters , could further be related to the age of coronal holes . since the area and the mean magnetic field density of coronal holes depend on the age of coronal holes @xcite , the unbalanced magnetic flux and the percentage unbalanced magnetic flux also depend on the age of coronal holes .",
    "if we assume for simplicity that the entirety of small coronal holes belong to the birth and end of coronal holes and the entirety of large coronal holes to the middle of their life time , the different range of scatter in the characteristic parameters of small to large coronal holes might simply be explained by the different phases in their life time .",

    "in addition , a high average magnetic field density of flux tubes is always related to comparably high magnetic field densities of quiet coronal hole regions , i.e.  the coronal hole region without the flux tubes .",
    "this relationship results in a distinct polarity at all magnetic levels within the coronal hole , and to a more pronounced polarity and thus a higher percentage unbalanced magnetic flux at higher mean magnetic field densities of the overall coronal hole .",

    "the magnetic flux tubes we identified by a thresholding technique are likely to be related to the coronal magnetic funnels described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the magnetic funnels are rooted near supergranulation boundaries in the chromospheric network lanes , and are the origin of plasma outflows which form high - speed solar wind streams .",
    "the outflow velocity is statistically higher in regions with a higher magnetic field density in the underlying photosphere @xcite .",
    "if we assume that our magnetic flux tubes coincide with the foot points of the magnetic funnels , then we can speculate that the averaged plasma outflow velocity might be related to the averaged magnetic field density of the magnetic flux tubes , and therefore might also be related to the mean magnetic field density of the overall coronal hole .",
    "finally , we note that the very strong correlation between the averaged magnetic parameters of flux tubes extracted at various magnetic levels , the quiet coronal hole regions , and the overall coronal hole parameters ( @xmath160 ) show that there has to be an underlying mechanism which sets the distribution of flux tubes , and which relates the averaged magnetic field density of flux tubes to the mean magnetic field density of quiet coronal hole regions in an uniquely defined way .",
    "furthermore , this mechanism has to contain the strong dependency between the mean magnetic field density , the mean unsigned magnetic field density , and the percentage unbalanced magnetic flux of coronal holes ( @xmath0 ) .",
