    "the phenomenon of the so - called gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) puzzles the theorists from many points of view ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the most striking feature of grbs is that an enormous energy is released in few seconds in terms of gamma - rays having typical energies of few hundred kev .",
    "the energy emitted in grbs is up to @xmath7 erg , making it difficult to devise a mechanism able to transform efficiently enough the gravitational energy into such a powerful photon emission .",
    "in addition , the bursts show a variety of complex time - structures of the light curves .",
    "the time - structure of the prompt emission and the recent discovery of the afterglow fit the expectations of the so - called fireball model @xcite , in which the electromagnetic radiation is originated from the electron - positron plasma that expands at ultrarelativistic velocities undergoing internal and external shocks .",
    "the lorentz factor of the plasma has to be very large , @xmath8 , in order to solve the so - called compactness problem @xcite .",
    "so large values of @xmath9 are difficult to achieve because they require a very efficient mechanism to accelerate the plasma .",
    "in addition , in order to avoid the contamination of the @xmath10 plasma by more massive matter , the plasma has to be produced in a region of low baryonic density .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to power the @xmath10 plasma . in particular , it could be obtained via annihilation @xmath11 of the neutrinos emitted by a heavy compact collapsing object ",
    "collapsar @xcite .",
    "alternatively , neutrinos can be produced at the merger of two compact objects , e.g. of two neutron stars @xcite or a neutron star and a black hole @xcite .",
    "the latter possibilities were recently analyzed in details in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main challenge to the existing models is that the energy released in photons is astonishingly large .",
    "for example , the gamma - ray burst grb 990123 shows an energy release @xmath12 erg @xmath13 , if isotropic emission is assumed .",
    "taking into account a possible beaming , this energy can be reduced down to @xmath14 erg @xcite .",
    "there are also few other events ( e.g. grb 971214 and grb 980703 ) with typical energies @xmath15 erg , which show no evidence for collimation @xcite .",
    "the models invoking the @xmath16 reaction as a source for the grb have strong difficulties in reaching so large photon luminosities .",
    "although during the collapse of compact objects a relevant amount of energy is normally emitted in terms of neutrinos , the low efficiency of the @xmath16 reaction strongly reduces the energy deposited in the fireball .    in the present paper",
    "we propose that light pseudoscalar particles  pseudo - goldstone bosons ( pgbs )  can be extremely efficient messengers for transferring the gravitational energy released in the merger of compact stars , into ultrarelativistic @xmath1 plasma .",
    "we show that for certain parameter ranges the pgbs can be effectively produced inside the dense core of the collapsing system and then decay into @xmath17 or @xmath1 outside the system , in baryon free zones , thus giving rise to the ultrarelativistic @xmath10 plasma .",
    "the advantage of assuming that the fireball is produced via the pgb decay instead of @xmath18 annihilation is obvious .",
    "the latter process has a low efficiency ",
    "neutrinos deposit to plasma only few percent of the emitted energy and take the rest away .",
    "in addition , the process @xmath18 can be effective only at small distances , less than 100 km , which are still contaminated by baryon load , and it fails to provide a sufficiently large lorentz factor to the plasma , at most @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "instead , the pgb mechanism is 100 percent efficient : decay can take place at distances about 1000 km and , in addition , all energy emitted in terms of pgbs is deposited to the @xmath1 plasma with the lorentz factor @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a typical energy of emitted pgbs ( tens of mev ) and @xmath22 is the electron mass .",
    "this analysis is supported by the very recent result of ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows that if the energy would be transfered to the plasma at distances of at least few hundreds km , a successful burst could be obtained with a lorentz factor @xmath23 or so .",
    "the most familiar example of a pgb , the axion @xcite , has already been considered in connection with grbs @xcite .",
    "however , this was an invisible axion with the mass @xmath24 ev .",
    "such an axion has a lifetime much larger than the age of the universe and thus its decay is impossible .",
    "instead , it was assumed that the axions could convert into photons in strong magnetic fields near the collapsing system .",
    "it is questionable , however , how large the magnetic field has to be in order to achieve a large efficiency for the conversion .    in our analysis",
    "we phenomenologically consider a more general possibility , assuming that the pgb mass @xmath25 and its couplings to nucleons , electrons and photons are not constrained by the peccei - quinn relations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shortly review the results of refs .",
    "@xcite which describe the general scenario for mergers . in section 3",
    "we consider the pgb emission as a source for the grb and discuss the ranges for its mass and couplings which are compatible with the existing astrophysical constraints . in section 4 possible models for such axion - like particles are discussed . in section 5",
    "we analyze possible signatures of the proposed mechanism . in particular",
    ", we show that the pgbs emission could generate a grb associated with the supernovae type ib , c , and also help the supernova type ii explosion .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarize our findings .",
    "the scenarios depicted in refs . @xcite for the ns - ns and ns - bh mergers are actually very similar . in both cases an axially symmetric structure develops . in the center",
    "the system collapses into a black hole of a few solar masses , while a fraction of matter ( @xmath26 for ns - ns and @xmath27 for ns - bh ) obtains enough angular momentum to resist immediate collapse into the black hole and remains in an accretion torus around the black - hole .",
    "then this mass accretes from the torus into the bh going through a disk - like structure having a thickness which decreases approaching the bh .",
    "the central part of the disk is the most relevant for the radiation of energy , being the reservoir of largest density and temperature .",
    "the accretion rate from the torus @xmath28 is of the order of 1 @xmath29/s for ns - ns and 5 @xmath29/s for ns - bh , so the duration of this phase is essentially similar in both cases , @xmath30 s.    according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the energy is radiated from the disk via the neutrino emission .",
    "the deposition of energy in a region with low baryonic mass proceeds through @xmath31 annihilation into @xmath10 .",
    "the observed grb is produced by the @xmath1 plasma which expands at ultra - relativistic velocity .",
    "the energy deposited into the @xmath1 plasma ranges from @xmath32 erg in the case of ns - ns merger up to @xmath33 erg for the ns - nh merger .",
    "the lorentz factor are always rather small , @xmath19 .    an important point in the simulations of refs .",
    "@xcite concerns the density and temperature profiles of the system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the neutrino trapping has been taken into account , the maximum density is @xmath34 g/@xmath35 , with small regions reaching @xmath36 g/@xmath35 . on the contrary , in ref .",
    "@xcite where neutrinos are assumed to skip freely , densities are generally smaller by about an order of magnitude . when neutrino trapping is taken into account , larger densities , similar to the ones in ref .",
    "@xcite , are obtained . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is indeed shown that the density of the disk depends on the amount of energy lost by matter in this region .",
    "it is clear that only a totally self - consistent calculation can indicate if neutrinos are trapped , reducing the luminosity of neutrino emission and therefore allowing for a larger density in the center of the disk .",
    "the connection between cooling and density is due to the contribution to the pressure coming from radiation and relativistic electrons and positrons . if the cooling is switched - off , only gas pressure is present and the system stabilizes at larger densities",
    ".    it will be important in our discussion to keep in mind that a more efficient way of extracting energy from the system , e.g. via pgbs emission , will in turn modify the density in the center of the disk .",
    "since in our work we do not pretend to solve the dynamics of the system , but we only indicate a new possibility for powering a strong grb , we will consider for the central density of the disk values ranging from @xmath34 g/@xmath35 down to @xmath37 g/@xmath35 .",
    "the estimated temperature profiles of the disk are rather similar in refs . @xcite and @xcite , reaching about 10 mev in the central part and remaining above 1 mev up to distances of the order of 100 km from the center of the system .",
    "let us consider the following lagrangian describing the pgb couplings to the fermions @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and electromagnetic field - strength tensor @xmath40 : = -12 m^2_a a^2 - ig_aia |_i_5_i - g_a4m_na f_f^ + .... [ lagrangian ] where in the last term the nucleon mass @xmath41 is taken as a regulator scale . in cases of the familiar models of the pgb like the axion ,",
    "its mass and couplings are all determined , but for some coefficients , by only one free parameter @xmath42 , the scale of the global @xmath43 symmetry . instead , here we take a more phenomenological approach , considering @xmath25 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 as independent quantities .",
    "let us start by discussing which constraints should be imposed immediately on the pgb mass and its couplings in order to obtain a strong grb without violating the already existing experimental and astrophysical limits . in particular , we consider the mass and the coupling to the nucleon within the range 0.3  mev < m_a < few   mev [ m - limit ] 10 ^ -6 < g_an < 10 ^ -4 [ g - limit ] the upper mass limit comes from the following . in order to have efficient pgb production in the dense systems under consideration , its mass should not over - exceed the characteristic temperature of the latter , typically of few mev .",
    "the lower mass limit in ( [ m - limit ] ) enables to avoid the astrophysical constraints from the stellar evolution .",
    "the pgb production rate in the stellar cores with typical temperatures @xmath47 up to 10 kev , is proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "thus , in order to avoid too fast stellar cooling , the exponential factor needs to be small if the constant @xmath45 falls in the range indicated in ( [ g - limit ] ) .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath45 comes from supernovae .",
    "it implies that the pgbs are trapped in the collapsing core and thus the sn 1987a neutrino signal is not affected @xcite .",
    "is also acceptable for the constraints coming from neutrino emission in supernovae @xcite , but is not of interest for our analysis . ] finally , the upper limit in ( [ g - limit ] ) stands for a conservative interpretation of the set of constraints coming from the search of the decay @xmath49 , from the beam dump and other terrestrial experiments @xcite .",
    "the experimental limits on the couplings @xmath46 and @xmath44 will be discussed later .",
    "let us discuss now in more details the range of the pgb parameters needed for successfully producing the grbs .",
    "the pgb can decay into photons and , if @xmath50 , also into @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding decay width is @xmath51 , where ( a ) = g_a^264m_n^2 m_a^3 , ( ae^+e^- ) = g_ae^28 m_a ( 1-)^1/2 .",
    "as we anticipated in the introduction , we discuss the emission of pgbs by the central part of the toroidal system with typical size @xmath52 km , obtained during the merger of two compact objects .",
    "we assume that these pgbs take away a large fraction of the energy of the system and we want them to decay into photons or @xmath1 preferentially outside the disk , in the region of low baryon density , thus giving rise to the hot relativistic plasma .",
    "therefore a reasonable choice for the decay length of the pgbs , @xmath53 , is in the range 100  km < d_a < 10000  km .",
    "[ distance ] here @xmath54 is the lifetime of the pgb at rest and @xmath55 is its lorentz factor . the average energy of the emitted pgbs can be taken as @xmath56 , where @xmath47 is a temperature of the system . since @xmath47 is of the order of several mev , the lorentz factor @xmath57 ranges from 2 - 3 up to 20 or more , depending on the mass of the pgb .",
    "the values of @xmath44 and @xmath46 corresponding to a given decay length @xmath58 , as functions of @xmath25 , are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the upper limit in ( [ distance ] ) is not rigidly determined and is inferred from the following . in the literature it is argued that there is a correlation between some grbs and supernovae type ib / c @xcite . on the other hand , the observed frequency of supernova explosions is orders of magnitude larger than the observed frequency of grbs .",
    "therefore not every sn explosion is accompanied by a detected grbs .",
    "if a supernova type ib / c emits a grb , the latter must be a rather weak one , so that it is detected only in few cases .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 should be less than the typical radius of the type ib / c supernova progenitors ( @xmath59 km ) , so that the strength of the associated grb is suppressed by a factor @xmath60 .",
    "obviously , this suppression is enormous in the case of sn type ii which progenitor has a typical radius larger than @xmath61 km . in particular",
    "this makes clear the absence of a detectable grb associated with sn 1987a .",
    "the mean free path of a pgb having energy @xmath21 depends on the density @xmath62 and on the temperature @xmath47 of matter , on the neutron and proton mass fractions @xmath63 and @xmath64 and , of course , on the pgb coupling to nucleons @xmath45 .",
    "( here and in the following , we take for simplicity the pgb couplings to proton and neutron to be equal , @xmath65 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the mean free path is approximated by the following expression : _ a = g_an^-2  f(x_n , x_p , e / t )  l_a(,t ) , where the coefficient @xmath66 is of order 1 for typical energies @xmath67 and l_a=(2.810 ^ -7  cm ) _ 12 ^ -2 t[mev]^1/2 , [ la ] with @xmath68 being the density in units of @xmath69 .",
    "for a given density and temperature one can estimate the critical value of @xmath45 for which the pgbs become trapped .",
    "we denote this value as @xmath70 .",
    "clearly , only an exact knowledge of the density and temperature profiles of the system can allow a precise determination of this quantity .",
    "however , we are only interested in a qualitative analysis and in our estimate we simply assume that the pgb is trapped when @xmath71 is smaller than the typical radius of the system @xmath72 km . in other words ,",
    "we define the critical value @xmath73 as a function of a given density and temperature from the following equation , the values we find for @xmath73 are clearly underestimated with respect to the actual values by a factor @xmath74 few , where @xmath75 is the actual size of the region having a given density and temperature . however , this approximation is sufficient to our purposes . ]",
    "( g_an^tr)^-2 l_a(,t ) = r. [ trap ] hence , using eq .",
    "( [ la ] ) we obtain : g_an^tr(,t ) = 2.410 ^ -7 _ 12 ^ -1 t[mev]^1/4 , [ g - tr ] assuming for instance @xmath76mev and @xmath77 g/@xmath35 , the pgbs are un - trapped for @xmath78 .",
    "if the density is smaller , @xmath73 increases .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath79 g/@xmath35 , @xmath80 , while for @xmath81 g/@xmath35 , @xmath82 .      in the conditions of density and temperature typical for the central region of the disk , baryonic matter is non - degenerate , and",
    "the pgb production is dominated by bremsstrahlung from nucleons .",
    "the analogous process from electrons is less efficient , also because the latter are partially degenerate at the densities and temperatures we are considering here .",
    "we use for the pgb production rate the expression @xcite : q_nd = g_an^2 r_nd(,t ) = g_an^2 272_^2105 ^3/2 t^7/2 ^ 2m_n^9/2 = g_an^2 _ 12 ^ 2 t[mev]^7/2 2.310 ^ 45  erg / cm^3s where , for simplicity , we consider symmetric nuclear matter , i.e. @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the pion - nucleon coupling constant @xcite . in fig .",
    "2 we show @xmath85[erg @xmath86 s@xmath87)$ ] as a function of the temperature and of the density .    let us now estimate the maximal possible luminosity of the pgb emission as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "clearly , if the pgbs are emitted from a volume with given density and temperature in un - trapping regime , then their luminosity increases with @xmath45 and reaches the maximum at @xmath88 .",
    "for the values of @xmath45 larger than @xmath73 , the pgbs become trapped and their luminosity starts to decrease , since only the pgb emission from the surface becomes possible . to compute the total luminosity we need also to estimate a corresponding volume associated with the un - trapped regime .",
    "the maximal luminosity for a volume @xmath89 with a given density and temperature reads therefore : l_a^max= [ g_an^tr(,t)]^2r_nd(,t)v(,t ) we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to estimate the magnitude of the maximal luminosity .",
    "let us consider , for example , the central zone with @xmath90 g @xmath86 and @xmath91 mev .",
    "the corresponding volume is roughly @xmath92 km@xmath93 .",
    "then , according to eq .",
    "( [ g - tr ] ) we obtain @xmath94 , and thus we get @xmath95 erg / s , clearly a very large value which would be sufficient to power the most energetic bursts .",
    "s@xmath96 erg s@xmath97 . as we noted above , in case of the ns - bh merger",
    "the later rate is about 5 times bigger . ]",
    "it can be interesting to notice that @xmath98 is proportional to @xmath99 , while @xmath73 is roughly proportional to @xmath100 as is indicated by eqs .",
    "( [ trap ] ) and ( [ la ] ) .",
    "hence , the maximal luminosity very weakly depends on the central density .    of course",
    ", the actual luminosity can be smaller .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath101 the emission rate is simply proportional to @xmath102 . if , on the other hand , @xmath103 , then the emission rate is suppressed due to the pgb trapping . in this case",
    "the volume in which the pgbs are trapped becomes ineffective , since now it contributes only through the surface emission , and so the dominant contribution comes from outer zones with smaller densities in which pgbs are still un - trapped .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the emission rate in the trapping regime .",
    "taking , for example , @xmath104 , i.e. one order of magnitude larger then previous value , one can roughly estimate the total luminosity as @xmath105 erg / s , one order of magnitude less then above .",
    "therefore , a luminosity larger than @xmath106erg / s can be obtained for @xmath45 in the range : 10 ^ -6 < g_an < 310 ^ -5 .",
    "it is important to notice that , since the pgb luminosity is so large , a precise determination of the latter is inessential . actually , for this range of @xmath45 the pgb emission drains all the energy available from the system .    for sake of simplicity in our analysis",
    "we have mainly considered the density and temperature profiles which are characteristic for the ns - ns merger .",
    "let us shortly comment also the case of ns - bh merger .",
    "the latter gives somewhat larger densities and temperatures than the ns - ns merger .",
    "as observed above , a change in the density is not affecting the maximal luminosity @xmath107 .",
    "a slightly larger temperature , on the other hand , corresponds to a larger production rate @xmath108 and therefore to a larger luminosity .",
    "let us discuss now which particle physics candidate could be the pgb with the above properties . as we told already , the most familiar example is the axion , the pgb associated with the spontaneous breaking of the peccei - quinn symmetry @xmath43 needed for the solution of the strong cp - problem .",
    "the standard axion @xcite is excluded by laboratory experiments long ago .",
    "however , several types of invisible axions have been considered in the literature : the dfsz axion @xcite , the ksvz or hadronic axion @xcite , archion @xcite , etc . in these models",
    "the pq symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the large vev of some scalar @xmath109 , singlet of the standard model : @xmath110 . the axion interactions to matter fields have the form ( [ lagrangian ] ) where the coupling constants to the fermions and photon are related to the scale @xmath42 as follows : g_ai= c_im_if   ( i = e , p , n ... ) ,   g_a = c _ , [ couplings ] with @xmath111 and @xmath112 being the model dependent coefficients ( generically , axion models employ a number of heavy fermion states that contribute to the colour @xmath113 and electromagnetic @xmath21 anomalies of the @xmath43 current ) . for",
    "any type of axion , its couplings to nucleons do not vary strongly from model to model and , typically , @xmath114 are in the range 0.31.5 . as for @xmath46 and @xmath44 ,",
    "their model dependence is stronger .",
    "for example , for the dfsz axion model containing only the standard fermion families ( @xmath115 is the number of families , and @xmath116 ) we have c_e^dfsz=^2 ,   c_^dfsz = 2n_fz1+z , where @xmath117 is the vev ratio of the up and down higgs doublets @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "thus , for @xmath120 and a natural range @xmath121 , @xmath122 varies from 1/2 to 1 , while @xmath112 depends on the value of up / down quark mass ratio @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , @xmath124 can vary between 0.10 and 0.35 . on the other hand , for the dfsz - like axion we have @xmath125 .",
    "for the hadronic axion or the archion the coupling to electrons is strongly suppressed .",
    "for example , for the hadronic axion @xmath126 at tree level and it emerges from radiative corrections .",
    "namely , we have @xcite c_e = ( e - c _ ) ,  c_= e - 2(4+z)3(1+z )",
    "n , where @xmath127 gev is a qcd scale",
    ". in the gut context one typically has @xmath116 , however this value is not mandatory for a general case . essentially the same order estimates hold for the archion couplings , which in addition can have also a small tree level coupling to electron , with @xmath128 @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the axion mass is also related to the pq symmetry breaking scale as @xmath129 and thus for @xmath130 gev it is too light to be applicable for our mechanism .",
    "however , we do not constrain the magnitude of @xmath25 with this relation and leave it as free parameter , in the range indicated in ( [ m - limit ] ) . in the context of a theory having the @xmath43 symmetry",
    ", this would mean that the axion mass is not determined by the colour anomaly but rather by some other dynamics .",
    "for example , one can imagine that its mass emerges from the @xmath43 current anomaly related to some hidden gauge sector with the confinement scale larger than @xmath131 ( in this case this axion would solve the strong cp problem in this sector ) .",
    "alternatively , the lagrangian could contain the higher order terms cutoff by the planck scale which explicitly break the pq symmetry and thus produce the pgb mass @xcite . in either case ,",
    "such pgb would not be anymore relevant for the strong cp problem .",
    "one can rather consider it as a `` would be '' axion which could work for strong cp but is prevented to do so by the explicit @xmath43 breaking terms which in general have no reason to respect the strong @xmath132 phase orientation .",
    "for example , taking the planck scale induced terms in the lagrangian as @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is a coupling constant , one can estimate the pgb mass as @xcite m_a =   ( f10 ^ 5  gev)^3/2 6  mev [ mass ] although the coincidence most probably is simply accidental , we remark that for the dfsz - like `` failed '' model with @xmath135 gev ( and hence @xmath3 , @xmath136 ) , the pgb mass in eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) naturally falls in the range of few mevs .",
    "we come now back to the analysis of our constraints on the pgb couplings , interpreting these constraints in the light of the above discussed models . in fig .",
    "3 we show the isocurves corresponding to a fixed decay length @xmath58 of the pgb with a given energy @xmath21 , for different values of @xmath25 .",
    "we also indicate typical correlations between the couplings @xmath46 and @xmath44 as they emerge for various axion models .",
    "we see that there can be two type of solutions . for the dfsz axion",
    "it is definitely the case of decay into @xmath1 which can work .",
    "it corresponds to values of the constant @xmath137 , i.e. @xmath138 gev and axion mass of few mev .",
    "interestingly , the parameters range excluded by the present reactor experiments @xcite is approaching the parameters spot we are indicating , but the parameters value we are suggesting is not yet excluded . it must also be remarked that for such values of @xmath42 the axion - nucleon coupling constant lies within the range of interest for the grb , @xmath139 .",
    "another solution for the dfsz , via axion decay into photons ( vertical lines in fig",
    ". 3 for @xmath140 mev ) leads to @xmath141 which is ruled out by experiment @xcite .    as for the case of the hadronic axion or archion , which have a coupling to electrons suppressed by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude",
    "if compared to the dfsz axion , the decay rate into photons is comparable to that into @xmath1 when the latter is allowed ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "however , it requires a too large @xmath44 , above @xmath143 . the experimental limit of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath144 tev , excludes this possibility .",
    "perhaps , this solution is still allowed with a larger axion mass , @xmath145 mev , but this question needs an additional investigation .",
    "in the previous sections we have considered grbs emerging by axion emission during a ns - ns or ns - bh merger . however , the proposed mechanism can have strong implications also for the grbs associated with supernova explosion , as well as for the supernova explosion itself .    in the typical situation we considered ,",
    "axions produced in a compact disk fly away taking the big portion of the available energy . in case of merger the typical size of the system is of the order of 100 km ",
    "there is essentially no baryonic matter outside this radius , so the axion flux , after decay into photons or @xmath1 at a distance larger then 100 km , converts into a fireball  a bubble ( or jet ) of hot relativistic plasma expanding with a large lorentz factor .",
    "however , the axions can be produced also in the core of collapsing stars .",
    "in particular , for @xmath146 the axions are essentially in the trapping regime in the supernovae exploding via core collapse .",
    "axions are emitted from the axiosphere , having a temperature decreasing with time from @xmath147 mev at @xmath148 ms to @xmath91 mev at @xmath149 s. the corresponding luminosities are @xmath150 erg / s at @xmath151 ms and @xmath152 erg / s at @xmath153 s @xcite .",
    "therefore , in total an energy @xmath154 erg can be emitted during the collapse period and subsequent cooling of the proto - neutron star , in terms of axions having an average energy @xmath155 mev .",
    "since @xmath21 is of the same order as the one in case of mergers , the value @xmath156 is again of the order of few hundred or few thousand km .",
    "then in our scenario the impact of the axions simply depends on the geometrical size of the collapsing star .    in particular , supernovae type ib , c are the result of core collapse of relatively small stars , where the hydrogen and perhaps also the helium shells are missing .",
    "a typical radius for sn ic is @xmath59 km .",
    "therefore , the axion decay length @xmath157 is comparable to @xmath158 .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath159 is not very small , it can be of order 0.1 to 1 , and thus a reasonable amount of axions decay outside the mantle .",
    "clearly , this also implies that the bulk of axions decaying outside the star produces a fireball ( with a lorentz factor @xmath160 ) .",
    "we can conclude that , associated with a supernova type ib , c a grb could take place , having a typical energy @xmath154 erg .    in case of sn type ii , which are associated with large stars , e.g. red giants , having an extended hydrogen shell ( @xmath161 km ) , the axion decay takes place completely inside the mantle and thus can not be observed as grb .",
    "for example , for sn 1987a , related to the blue giant sanduleak having @xmath162 km , the fraction of axions decaying outside the envelope , @xmath60 , is essentially zero . nevertheless , it can be of interest to think that the energy of order @xmath6 erg released after axion decay at distances of few hundred or thousand km can help to solve the painful problem of mantle ejection and therefore of supernova explosion ( in the prompt mechanism , shock stalls at a distance of few hundred km ) .",
    "mev could provide a mechanism whereby gravitationally collapsing massive stars may eject their outer mantles and envelopes in supernova explosions was first considered in ref .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the range for the coupling @xmath44 explored in ref .",
    "@xcite actually corresponds to the vertical band of our fig .",
    "3 and it is strongly excluded by the experimental limits @xcite . we thank s. blinnikov for driving our attention to the ref . @xcite . ]",
    "we have shown that it exists a range of values for the pgb parameters such that a strong pgb emission takes place during the ns - ns or ns - bh merger .",
    "choosing appropriately the parameters value , the total luminosity for the pgb emission can be as large as @xmath163 erg / s . moreover , at variance with the mechanism based on @xmath18 annihilation which has a small ( about one percent ) efficiency , the pgb emission mechanism suffers no energy deficit : all emitted pgbs , due to their decay into @xmath1 or photons , convert into the ultrarelativistic plasma , the fireball , which is at the origin of the burst .",
    "this plasma can be produced at distances as large as 100 km @xmath164 10000 km ( which are difficult to achieve in the case of plasma produced via @xmath31 annihilation ) , is not contaminated by baryonic matter and thus a large lorentz factor can be obtained .",
    "our conclusion is supported by the numerical simulations given in the recent ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility opened by our mechanism is the association of `` weak '' grbs with the supernovae type ib , c .",
    "in addition , the pgb emission could also help to solve the problem of supernovae type ii explosion , thus providing an unified theoretical base for the grb and sn phenomena .",
    "the needed parameter range for such a pgb indicate an axion - like particle having a mass @xmath25 of a few mev , coupling to nucleons @xmath2 and to electrons @xmath3 .",
    "this range of coupling constants coincides to that of the invisible axion with the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking scale @xmath4 gev .",
    "however , for such scale @xmath42 a `` true '' axion would have a mass of few ev whereas we our pgb has a mass of few mev , i.e. about a million times larger .",
    "present experimental data and astrophysical limits can not exclude this particle , however the relevant parameters window is not far from the present experimental limits and it can be experimentally tested in the close future .",
