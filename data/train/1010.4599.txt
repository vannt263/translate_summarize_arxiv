    "understanding the source of quantum advantage in quantum computation is a long - standing issue in quantum information science .",
    "previous researches have shown that certain quantum computation is ` classical ' , for the reason that it is efficiently simulateable by classical computers .",
    "one example is any computation performed just by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite without using any entangled resources .",
    "all models of quantum computation outperforming classical counterparts use entanglement resources ( such as measurement - based quantum computation  @xcite ) or some kind of non - locc operation .",
    "non - locc operations are called ` global ' operations .",
    "the source of quantum speedup must be due to the properties of the global operations . in this paper",
    ", we refer to the properties exclusive to global operations as _ globalness _ of quantum operations .",
    "it is also known that not all global operations result in quantum speedup for quantum computation .",
    "there must be a specific globalness that differentiates the quantum operations leading to quantum speedup from those do not",
    ". the difference may be due to more than one kind of globalness , but even this is not clear at this point .",
    "for this reason , having a good understanding of the globalness of quantum operations is important . in this paper",
    ", we try to understand the simplest case of the global operations , namely , bipartite unitary operations .",
    "to investigate globalness of unitary operations , it is important to clarify what kind of states is given as inputs of the unitary operations .",
    "we want to evaluate the globalness that does not depend on a choice of a particular input state . by introducing the concept of _ pieces of quantum information _",
    ", we analyze characterizations of unitary operations for two pieces of quantum information represented by arbitrary unknown states , in terms of _ delocalization power _",
    "@xcite and _ entanglement cost _ @xcite .",
    "we compare these characterizations with another characterization , _ entangling power _ of global operations @xcite , which characterizes the globalness of unitary operations acting on a set of known states .",
    "then we extend our analysis of globalness in terms of the delocalization power in two ways by introducing new locc tasks .",
    "one of the tasks is _ locc one - piece relocalization _ for _ one piece _ of delocalized quantum information that corresponds to the case when a part of input state is unknown and arbitrary but the other part can be chosen from a set of known state .",
    "the other task is _ locc one - piece relocation _ for two pieces of delocalized quantum information , which evaluates the ability of the unitary operation to relocate one of the two pieces of quantum information from one hilbert space to another by adding locc to the unitary operation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as following . in section",
    "[ overview ] , we introduce the concept of pieces of quantum information and present an overview on the three characterizations .",
    "we summarize the comparison of different aspects of the globalness of bipartite unitary operations presented in the previous works in section [ comparison ] .",
    "we extend the analysis of the delocalization power in sections [ fixed_input ] and [ relocation ] . in section [ fixed_input ] , we show the result on locc one - piece relocalization for one piece of delocalized quantum information . in section [ relocation ] , we analyze locc one - piece relocation of two pieces of quantum information .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] , we present our conclusion .",
    "first , we define _ a piece of quantum information _ for a @xmath0-dimensional quantum system , or _ qudit _ , whose hilbert space is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "if a pure quantum state of @xmath2 qudits @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a fixed set of normalized and mutually orthogonal states in @xmath6 and the coefficients @xmath7 are arbitrary and unknown except for the normalization @xmath8 , the unknown state @xmath9 is said to represent _ one piece _ of quantum information for a qudit .    in the formalism presented above , a piece of quantum information for a single qudit can be stored in an @xmath2-qudit system using an arbitrary set of orthonormal states , @xmath5 .",
    "any such set of states would form a _",
    "logical _ qudit space , but in a special case satisfying @xmath10 for all @xmath11 , where the set of states @xmath12 forms an orthonormal basis of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is independent of @xmath15 , the piece of quantum information is stored in a _ physical _ qudit .",
    "hence it is possible to _ assign _ one physical qudit for each piece of quantum information .    using this formalism",
    ", now we provide the formal definition of one piece of _ localized _ quantum information for a qudit .",
    "we label the qudits of an @xmath2-qudit system from @xmath16 to @xmath17 and denote the hilbert space of qudit @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "the hilbert space of @xmath17 qudits _ excluding _ a certain qudit @xmath18 will be denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "we will also assume that two different pieces of quantum information in the same system are assigned to different physical qudits .    for @xmath21 , a piece of quantum information represented by an unknown @xmath2-qudit state @xmath9 is said to be _",
    "localized _ at _ an assigned _ hilbert space @xmath19 , or simply localized when there is no fear of confusion , if it is represented in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is any basis of the hilbert space of the assigned qudit ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath19 ) , @xmath24 is an @xmath25-qudit state determined independently of the set of coefficients @xmath26 , and @xmath26 are arbitrary coefficients satisfying the normalization condition @xmath8 .",
    "note that the global phase factor of the coefficients is not a physical quantity , so we take the global phase equivalence .",
    "there are @xmath27 complex degrees of freedom in total for one piece of quantum information . for @xmath28 , since @xmath29 is the minimal hilbert space to store one piece of quantum information for a qudit , one piece of quantum information has to be localized in @xmath30 .",
    "we define the concept of _ delocalized _ quantum information , which is the complement of localized quantum information , and also the concept of _ delocalization _ of quantum information .",
    "if a piece of quantum information is _ not _ localized , then it is said to be _",
    "delocalized_. the task of delocalizing quantum information is called _",
    "delocalization_.    next , we consider two - qudit states , where the state of each qudit represents one piece of localized quantum information .",
    "we denote the two hilbert spaces of the qudits by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the two pieces of localized quantum information can be represented by a tensor product state @xmath33 , where the subscripts of the kets denote the assignment of the hilbert spaces of the qudits , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we define delocalization for two pieces of quantum information as the following .",
    "two pieces of quantum information are said to be _",
    "delocalized _ , if the state representing the two pieces of quantum information _ can not _ be written by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 on @xmath38 and @xmath39 on @xmath40 are arbitrary local unitary operations but independent of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we again note that we have already assigned a hilbert space for each piece of quantum information , so the state @xmath43 represents delocalized two pieces of quantum information out from the assigned hilbert spaces .",
    "now we investigate the effects of a global unitary operation @xmath44 applied on two pieces of localized quantum information @xmath33 .",
    "if the unitary operation @xmath44 is not a tensor product of two local unitary operations on @xmath38 and @xmath40 , @xmath44 always transforms each piece of localized quantum information to delocalized quantum information . in this paper",
    ", we say that the unitary operations have _ delocalization power _ , which in a sense is the ` strength ' of delocalization of quantum information due to the unitary operations .",
    "how pieces of quantum information are delocalized is determined only by the set of orthonormal states representing the quantum information , which in turn is determined by the unitary operation used for the delocalization .",
    "therefore , the globalness of unitary operations can be studied by understanding how a unitary operation delocalizes pieces of quantum information .",
    "later , we argue that certain pieces of quantum information are ` more ' delocalized than others .",
    "the difference in the level of delocalization can only have come from the difference in the globalness of the unitary operation , namely , the delocalization power .",
    "hence , we can classify the delocalization power by analyzing the level of the delocalization that each unitary operation achieves .    to define and classify the level of delocalization",
    ", we introduce the following locc task , _ locc one - piece relocalization _ , that aims to localize just one of the two pieces of delocalized quantum information by sacrificing the other piece of quantum information in @xmath45 .",
    "we denote the set of density operators on the hilbert space @xmath13 by @xmath46 .",
    "_ locc one - piece relocalization _ of qudit @xmath47 for two pieces of quantum information delocalized by a global unitary operation @xmath44 is a task to find an locc - implementable completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) map @xmath48 satisfying @xmath49 = { { \\left \\vert}\\psi_b { \\right \\rangle}}_b { { \\left \\langle}\\psi_b { \\right \\vert}}\\ ] ] for any @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we characterize the delocalization power of global unitary operations in terms of their ability to allow locc one - piece relocalization on two pieces of quantum information delocalized by the global unitary operations .",
    "we define the order of the delocalization power of two global unitary operations @xmath44 and @xmath50 on two pieces of quantum information by the following .",
    "if locc one - piece relocalization of two pieces of delocalized quantum information is possible for a unitary operation @xmath44 , but not possible for another unitary operation @xmath50 , the order of the delocalization power of @xmath44 is defined to be smaller than that of @xmath50 in terms of locc one - piece relocalization .",
    "another way to quantify the globalness of a unitary operation applied on quantum information is to evaluate how much extra global resource is required on top of locc operations to implement the unitary operation on two pieces of quantum information .",
    "the minimum amount of entanglement required to deterministically implement a given global operation is unique , based on the fact that entanglement can not be generated by locc .",
    "we define an locc task , _ entanglement assisted deterministic locc implementation _ and then define _ entanglement cost _ of the unitary operation on quantum information in terms of this locc task .",
    "_ entanglement assisted deterministic locc implementation _ of a global unitary operation @xmath44 on two pieces of localized quantum information @xmath51 using a fixed bipartite resource state @xmath52 is a task of finding an locc - implementable cptp map @xmath53 satisfying @xmath54 for any @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "_ entanglement cost _ of a unitary operation @xmath44 on two pieces of quantum information is given by the minimum amount of entanglement of the resource state @xmath57 required to perform entanglement assisted deterministic locc implementation of @xmath44 on two pieces of localized quantum information .",
    "the entanglement cost of unitary operations can be regarded as the minimum entanglement cost for delocalizing two pieces of quantum information .",
    "thus this is another way to characterize the globalness of unitary operations applied on quantum information .",
    "we can also quantify the globalness of a unitary operation by evaluating its ability of entanglement generation in place of entanglement cost , similarly to the pair of the definitions for evaluating the globalness of quantum states , namely , distillable entanglement and entanglement cost .",
    "however , the amount of entanglement generated by a unitary operation strongly depends on the choice of input states , therefore it is difficult to define a quantity in terms of quantum information , namely , unknown states . instead , _ entangling power _ of a global operation @xcite",
    "is defined by optimizing the generated amount of entanglement over a set of known input states .",
    "the entangling power of a bipartite unitary operation @xmath44 ( denoted by @xmath58 ) is defined as the maximum amount of entanglement generated between the bipartite cut by applying @xmath44 on a known state , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is an entanglement measure of choice and @xmath61 is chosen among the given set of states .",
    "in the previous section , we introduced three different characterizations for the globalness of bipartite unitary operations : delocalization power , entanglement cost and entangling power . in this section ,",
    "we summarize known results on the three characterizations and investigate whether the globalness characterized by each method is same to or different from that of by the others .",
    "[ theorem : qq1pr ] locc one - piece relocalization for two pieces of quantum information of qudits delocalized by a unitary operation @xmath44 is possible if and only if @xmath44 is a locally unitary equivalent to a controlled - unitary operation @xmath62 , where @xmath63 forms an orthonormal basis for one of the subsystems and @xmath64 is a set of unitary operations on the other subsystem .",
    "@xcite    the characterization of globalness based on the delocalization power reveals that there are two classes of globalness for bipartite unitary operations , one class is a local unitary equivalent of a controlled - unitary operations , and the other class is all the rest of global unitary operations .    for any given two - qubit controlled - unitary operation , its entanglement cost for entanglement assisted deterministic locc implementation is 1 ebit when the schmidt number , the number of non - zero schmidt coefficients , of the resource state is 2 .",
    "@xcite    for other two - qubit unitary operations , the entanglement cost of the swap operation @xmath65 , of which action is given by @xmath66 for any @xmath67 and @xmath68 , is easily shown to be 2 ebit by considering the situation where the two input qubits are parts of maximally entangled states . however , for more general operations , it is not easy to evaluate the minimum entanglement cost of entanglement assisted locc implementation , therefore , it is still unknown .",
    "the formulation of entangling power depends on the set of allowed input states and the measure of entanglement .",
    "entangling power is usually difficult to calculate because it involves two optimizations .",
    "one is the maximization over all possible input states ( usually taken to be separable or product states ) .",
    "the other is the calculation of the amount of generated entanglement according to the chosen entanglement measure .",
    "even when the quantum operation is restricted to bipartite unitary operations , the exact value is obtained for only limited cases  @xcite .",
    "for example , it is known that the cnot operation @xmath69 ( @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is given by the pauli matrix @xmath73 ) has the entangling power of 1 ebit and the swap operation @xmath65 has the entangling power of 2 ebit when we allow to use ancilla qubits .",
    "nevertheless , we can make a relatively generic statement about entangling power if the entanglement measure is continuous .",
    "the statement is as follows .",
    "the identity operation clearly generates no entanglement at all , hence its entangling power should be zero . invoking a continuity argument",
    ", there should be a set of operations in the neighborhood of the identity operation such that their entangling power is arbitrarily small .    however , when we evaluate the globalness in terms of the delocalization power and entanglement cost , a fundamental difference arrises . by using these two characterizations , all two - qubit controlled - unitary operations of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a single qubit unitary operation , belong to the same class of globalness irrelevant to their entangling power .",
    "thus , two - qubit controlled - unitary operations and their local unitary equivalent operations belong to a distinct class from the the class of identity operation , even when the local unitary operations are close to the identity ( @xmath76 ) , in contrast to the characterization in terms of entangling power",
    ".    on the other hand , for general _ known _ bipartite pure qudit states , the locc convertibility condition between two states is known .",
    "[ majorizationtheorem ] a bipartite state @xmath77 can be transformed to another state @xmath78 by using only locc , if and only if the schmidt coefficients of the @xmath77 is majorized by those of @xmath78 @xcite .    since the locc conversion protocol depends on the choice of states @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( when locc conversion from @xmath77 to @xmath78 is possible ) , it is essential that these states are known . by taking @xmath79 and @xmath80 and using theorem [ majorizationtheorem ]",
    ", we can see that if we have a resource state of which schmidt coefficients are equal to the those of @xmath78 , it is possible to obtain @xmath81 by locc . for two - qubit unitary operations , which can only create an entangled state with schmidt number 2 ,",
    "the majorization condition is equivalent to the comparison of the amount of entanglement .",
    "thus , we have the following corollary .    the entanglement cost of the resource state for entanglement assisted deterministic locc implementation of unitary operations on a _ given known _",
    "state @xmath33 is given by the the amount of entanglement of @xmath82 .",
    "this corollary gives a justification to define the entanglement cost for an entanglement assisted deterministic locc implementation on a set of known states by finding the largest minimum entanglement cost to perform @xmath44 over the set of input states . in this case",
    ", the entanglement cost for a set of known states coincides to the entangling power of @xmath44 .",
    "the results in this section indicate that there are several aspects of globalness in quantum operations .",
    "it is particularly important to clarify the types of input states , known states or unknown states representing pieces of quantum information , for analyzing globalness of unitary operations , since they lead to a fundamental difference .",
    "in the classification of globalness of unitary operations in terms of the delocalization power presented in the previous sections , we analyzed global properties of two pieces of delocalized quantum information .",
    "that is , we analyzed the globalness of unitary operations totally independent of input states . on the other hand , in section [ delocalizationpwer ]",
    ", we also defined _ one piece _ of delocalized quantum information .",
    "this situation corresponds to the case where one of the two input qudits is in an arbitrary and unknown state , but that of the other qudit is in a _ known _ state , and we can choose the most suitable state for performing tasks . in this section ,",
    "we extend our analysis on globalness of unitary operations in terms of delocalization power to the case for one piece of quantum information .",
    "we define the task of locc one - piece relocalization of _ one piece _ of delocalized quantum information",
    ".    _ locc one - piece relocalization _ of the qudit @xmath47 for _ one piece _ of quantum information delocalized by a global unitary operation @xmath44 is a task to find an locc - implementable cptp map @xmath48 and a state @xmath83 satisfying @xmath84 = { { \\left \\vert}\\psi_b { \\right \\rangle}}_b { { \\left \\langle}\\psi_b { \\right \\vert}}\\ ] ] for any @xmath35 .    we show the following lemma .    the global unitary operations that allow locc one - piece relocalization for one piece of delocalized quantum information is in a strictly wider class of global unitary operations than that allows locc one - piece relocalization for two pieces of delocalized quantum information .    to prove this lemma , we present an example of two - qubit unitary operations , @xmath85 , where locc one - piece relocalization is impossible for delocalized two pieces of quantum information , but it becomes possible if one of the qubits is promised to be in a particular pure state .",
    "let us take the computational basis , which is an orthonormal basis of the composite hilbert space @xmath45 given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are orthonormal base for @xmath38 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the matrix representation of @xmath89 in the computational basis is given by @xmath90    first , we show that locc one - piece relocalization of the qubit @xmath47 for one piece of quantum information delocalized by @xmath85 is possible by presenting that @xmath85 can be simulated by a locally unitary equivalent operation to a controlled - unitary operation if qubit @xmath91 is set to a particular state .",
    "we set the state @xmath92 to be @xmath93 .",
    "it is easy to check that for an arbitrary @xmath42 , @xmath94 where @xmath69 is a controlled - not operation and @xmath95 denotes the single - qubit hadamard operation represented in the computational basis by @xmath96 ( the same calculation can be done using the stabilizer formalism  @xcite by exploiting the fact that @xmath89 is a clifford operation . )",
    "thus the action of @xmath85 can be simulated by @xmath97 , a locally unitary equivalent operation to the controlled - not operation , when we fix one of the qubits to be in the state @xmath98 .    from theorem [ theorem : qq1pr ] ,",
    "any operation which is locally unitary equivalent to a controlled - unitary operation is locc one - piece relocalizable for two pieces of delocalized quantum information .",
    "note that , if an locc protocol relocalizes two pieces of delocalized quantum information , the same protocol must also relocalize one piece of delocalized quantum information . therefore , @xmath85 is locc one - piece relocalizable for one piece of delocalized quantum information .",
    "next , we show that @xmath89 itself is not locally unitary equivalent to controlled - unitary operations , therefore it is _ not _ locc one - piece relocalizable for two pieces of delocalized quantum information . to show this",
    ", we analyze the cartan numbers for two - qubit unitary operations .",

    "that some unitary operations remain locc one - piece _",

    "an example is the controlled - not operation on two qubits .",
    "in this paper , we first introduced the concept of pieces of quantum information and reviewed three different characterizations of the globalness of bipartite unitary operations , which were delocalization power , entanglement cost , and entangling power .",

    "next , we extended our analysis on characterization in terms of the delocalization power by introducing a new locc task , locc one - piece relocalization of _ one piece _ of quantum information delocalized by a unitary operation .",
    "we showed that there are unitary operations which belong to a higher globalness class in terms of the delocalization power than the local unitary equivalents of controlled - unitary operations , and such operations can be further divided into two subclasses depending on the possibility of this task .",
    "we also introduced another new task , locc one - piece relocation of two pieces of delocalized quantum information .",
    "we proved that locc one - piece relocation is impossible for any controlled - unitary operations .",
    "this confirms that the local unitary equivalents of controlled - unitary operations , which are locc one - piece relocalizable , belong to a class of global operations with relatively weak globalness also in terms of locc relocation of quantum information .    in our analysis of the locc tasks",
    ", we focused on the locc tasks that transform two pieces of quantum information within the two - qudit hilbert space .",
    "this is because our main purpose is to investigate the delocalization power of two - qudit unitary operations .",
    "but in general , we can investigate more general properties of delocalized pieces of quantum information by considering locc tasks that transforms @xmath2 pieces of quantum information delocalized in an @xmath192-qudit subspace of a totally @xmath193-qudit hilbert space ( @xmath194 and @xmath195 ) to @xmath196 pieces of quantum information delocalized in an @xmath197-qudit subspace ( @xmath198 and @xmath199 ) , by limiting the allowed operations to be locc for a certain devision of the total hilbert space .",
    "self - teleportation @xcite can be interpreted as a special case of this generalized locc task for @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 . by denoting the total hilbert space by @xmath203 , only locc",

    "it is shown that asymptotically , @xmath18-copies of any delocalized two pieces of quantum information in @xmath45 can be approximately ` relocated ' to @xmath204 .",
    "the error probability of this relocation drops exponentially with the number of copies @xmath18 as long as the two pieces of quantum information are delocalized , namely , not in a product state .    in our analysis of the delocalization power",
    ", we characterized the order of delocalization power of unitary operations by their ability allowing the locc tasks . for more quantitative analysis of the unitary operations that do not allow the locc tasks , it is important to analyze the entanglement cost of the corresponding entanglement assisted versions of the locc relocalization / relocation tasks .",
    "quantum state merging @xcite can be interpreted as evaluating the entanglement cost for performing entanglement assisted approximate generalized locc task for @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 ( @xmath208 ) , where only locc is allowed between the division of @xmath38 and @xmath204 and no operation is allowed on @xmath209 .",
    "this is an entanglement assisted locc task to achieve relocation of three pieces of quantum information delocalized in @xmath210 to @xmath211 . in the asymptotic limit , it is shown that the entanglement cost coincides with the quantum conditional entropy , which provides an operational interpretation of the quantum conditional entropy . to understand information theoretical meanings of our locc tasks",
