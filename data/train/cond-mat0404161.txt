    "semiflexible polyelectrolytes are ubiquitous in biological context ranging from biopolymers such as dna , filamentous @xmath1 actin , microtubules , and then all the way to molecular aggregates such as micelles or even whole organisms as in bacterial @xmath2 viruses or the tobacco mosaic virus . in all these cases",
    "we are dealing with objects that at an appropriate scale behave as euler - kirchhoffian elastic filaments .",
    "the most important mechanical characteristics in these molecular systems is the persistence length stemming from the bending rigidity of the polymer that can exhibit enormous variation in magnitude bracketted by nm on the lower end and mm on the upper end .    the bending rigidity and thus the persistence length is a consequence of short range atomic and molecular interactions and is itself a mesoscopic property @xcite .",
    "for charged semiflexible polymers the long range nature of the electrostatic interactions modifies the value of the persistence length as is well known from the seminal work of odijk , skolnick and fixman ( osf ) @xcite .",
    "recent detailed critical assessment of the osf conjecture @xcite confirmed the universality of the dependence of the persistence length on the parameters of the electrostatic interaction .",
    "it appears that the osf behavior characterized by the inverse dependence of the persistence length on the ionic strength of the bathing medium is quite robust .",
    "one of the main ingredients of the osf ideology is a complete lack of any atomic or molecular specificity in the interaction between charge segments along the polyelectrolyte . by assumption the mobile charges in solution and the fixed charges on the polyelectrolyte backbone",
    "interact only via generic ( screened ) coulomb interaction .",
    "though this assumption seems to be reasonable it would be appropriate to investigate what kind of behavior of persistence length is conferred by the effects of strong specificity as in _ e.g. _ the case of specific ion adsorption .",
    "recent experiments also suggest that reevaluation of the basic assumptions in our understanding of counterion - backbone interactions in polyelectrolytes would be highly desirable @xcite",
    ".    in specific ion adsorption mobile charges from the bathing solution and fixed charges along the polyelectrolyte can combine , leading to the emergence of higher multipoles along the polyelectrolyte chain , the first one being a dipole stemming from the association of a negative fixed charge and a specifically adsorbed mobile positive charge from the bathing solution .",
    "the same situation though for different reasons , specifically due to the low dielectric constant envoronment , could be obtained also in the context of ionomers @xcite .",
    "similar consideration could apply also to electrorheological or ferrofluids in external fields .",
    "muthukumar @xcite was the first to realize the importance and the extent of modifications wrought by the first higher multipole _",
    "i.e. _ the dipole , on the behavior of a _ flexible _",
    "polyelectrolyte described on the level of the edwards hamiltonian .",
    "he discovered the formation of localized aggregated structures along the chain that dominate the statistical behavior of the flexible polyelectrolyte chain .",
    "they are characterized by a different scaling of the size of the chain with respect to its length and depend continuously on the parameters of the dipolar interaction potential .",
    "chain flexibility as formalized by the edwards hamiltonian @xcite is essential for emergence of this type of aggregated structures .",
    "now assume a dipolar _ semiflexible _ chain , described as an euler - kirchhoffian filament with dipolar intersegment interactions .",
    "on top of that assume that the length of the chain is the largest length in the problem .",
    "this constitutes a complementary limit to be contrasted with the muthukumar calculation .",
    "the analysis provided by muthukumar and the one detailed below should thus brackett the behavior of any real polyelectrolyte chain with dipolar charges along its length .",
    "the problem with dipolar interactions is that they depend on the local orientation of the polyelectrolyte segments .",
    "this complicates the evaluation of the partition function of the semiflexible chain in an essentail manner . in order to make this complicated problem tractable",
    ", we will invoke the @xmath0-expansion method @xcite that has already been successfully applied to the problem of persistence length renormalization of a semiflexible polyelectrolyte chain @xcite with monopolar charges .",
    "this will allow us to explicitly evaluate the electrostatic contribution to the persistence length of a dipolar chain .",
    "as a point of departure we will assume that the dipolar charges along the chain interact _ via _ a screened coulombic interaction potential , the range of which is characterized by the debye screening length @xcite .",
    "we will derive the complete dependence of the electrostatic persistence length on the parameters of the dipolar interaction potential and show that it leads to a different behavior regarding its dependence on the ionic strength of the bathing solution then the standard osf result .",
    "we find basically two different regimes for the bahavior of the electrostatic persistence length of a dipolar chain    * for small but non - vanishing values of the screening length @xmath3 the electrostatic contribution to the persistence length behaves as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bare value of the persistence length .",
    "this expression would superseed the osf @xmath6 result valid for monopolar interactions .",
    "obviously the dipolar electrostatic renormalization of the persistence length depends more gently on the screening length . * for large values of the screening length",
    "@xmath3 the electrostatic contribution to the persistence length behaves as @xmath7where @xmath8 equals either @xmath9 or @xmath10 , depending on the strength of the dipolar interaction .",
    "this result should be compared with various variational estimates of a sub - osf behavior for a monopolar chain that lead to @xmath8 in the vicinity of @xmath11 .",
    "these two regimes stemm from two different limiting forms of a single equation giving the renormallized value of the persistence length as a function of the parameters describing the dipolar interactins along the chain .",
    "we also present complete numerical solutions of this equation in various regions of the parameter space .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 1",
    "we first rewrite the hamiltonian of a semiflexible polymer chain with screened dipolar interactions , assumed to be composed of the euler - kirchhoff elastic energy and the interaction energy , in a form that allows for a straightforward application of the @xmath0-expansion ansatz .",
    "we assume that the dipoles of the polymer segments are oriented along the local tangent vectors of the chain",
    ". this effective hamiltonian captures the elasticity of the chain , the inextensibility of the chain and the fact that electrostatic interactions depend on the position of the interacting segments as well as their orientation .",
    "section 2 introduces all the important approximations in order to make the evaluation of the partition function of the chain tractable .",
    "a diagonalization ansatz is introduced for the orientational part of the hamiltonian , a global inextensibility constraint is substituted for the local one and a saddle point evaluation is introduced for all the auxiliary fields that do not enter the hamiltonian on a quadratic level . in section 3",
    "the saddle point equations are solved explicitly by expanding all the fourier components of different auxiliary fields to the fourth order .",
    "this is consistent with the semiflexible ansatz for the configuraional part of the hamiltonian of the chain .",
    "section 4 introduces explicit equations for the bending rigidity renormalization that follow from the saddle point equations of the previous section .",
    "these equations are solved numerically in the last section .",
    "different limiting forms of the numeric solutions for limited regions of the parameter phase space are derived also analytically .",
    "we take a critical look at the results derived in this work and comment on the implied limitations of their validity and their connection with previous work on the electrostatic renormalization of the rigidity of semiflexible polymers .",
    "we investigate a semiflexible polymer chain with dipolar charges along the chain .",
    "the dipoles can be either structural or they can be a consequence of the specific adsorption of _ e.g. _ positive mobile charges from the bathing solution onto the fixed negative charges on the polyelectrolyte backbone . the total interaction energy of the chain is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 with @xmath14 the separation between two segments located at @xmath15 and @xmath16 along the chain , @xmath17 is the arclength of the chain , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are dipoles per unit length located at @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",
    "the above form of the screened dipolar interaction follows straightforwardly from the second order multipole expansion of the screened coulomb kernel @xcite and reduces to the usual form of the dipolar interaction in the lim it of no screening . on the debye - h \" uckel level @xmath21 where @xmath3 is the debye screening length .",
    "we furthermore assume that the dipole per unit length along the chain is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the strength of the dipolar moment per unit length of the segment and @xmath24 is the unit tangent vector .",
    "it is thus assumed that the dipoles point along the chain , and that the component of the dipoles perpendicular to the local axis of the chain is averaged out to zero . or model is thus `` perpendicular '' to ther case investigated in the context of protein folding @xcite . the interactions along the chain are therefore described with a generic form of segment - segment interactions that can be cast into the form @xmath25 with @xmath26 obiosuly the interaction eq .",
    "[ eq.1.0 ] depends on the positions of the interacting segments as well as on their orientation .",
    "this is the fundamental difference between monopolar and dipolar interactions .",
    "we have defined @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the bjerrum length @xcite .",
    "the units of @xmath29 are energy times length and are thus the same as the units of bending modulus of a semiflexible polymer chain .    the generic form of the interaction eq . [ eq.1.0 ]",
    "together with the euler - kirchhoffian elastic conformational part of the mesoscopic free energy @xcite can now be used to investigate the statistical behavior of a semiflexible dipolar chain .",
    "the mesoscopic hamiltonian of the chain can be written canonically as @xmath30 = \\frac12 k_c \\int_{0}^{l } ds \\left ( \\partial^2_s { \\bf r}(s ) \\right)^2 + \\frac12 \\int_{0}^{l}\\!\\!\\!\\int_{0}^{l } ds ds ' v({\\bf r}(s ) , { \\bf r}(s')).\\ ] ] where the local curvature is @xmath31 the bending rigidity @xmath32 is connected with the bare persistence length _ via _ @xmath33 . since in what follows the chain is assumed to be inextensible an additional constraint of @xmath34 should be taken into account .",
    "the partition function thus assumes the form @xmath35 \\pi_s \\delta^3\\left ( ( \\partial_s { \\bf r}(s))^2 - 1 \\right ) ~\\exp{-\\beta { \\cal h}[{\\bf r}(s)]}.\\ ] ] there are two difficult problems connected with this partition function : first of all we have the constraint of inextensibility that has to be enforced locally for every conformation of the chain , and on top of this there is the non - locality of the segment - segment interaction potential that couples different segments along the chain and depends also on their orientation .",
    "we will address both problems systematically by applying the method of lagrange multipliers @xcite .    to this effect",
    "we will introduce two additional terms into the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the inextensibility constraint is dealt with _ via _ the lagrange multiplier @xmath36 , leading to an additional term in the hamiltonian of the form @xmath37 together with an additional trace over @xmath36 in the expression for the partition function . in what follows",
    "we will assume that the inextensiblity constraint can be implemented globally instead of locally @xcite .",
    "this automatically means that @xmath38 .",
    "the non - locality of the interaction potential is more difficult to deal with then in the case of a chain without orientationally dependent interactions . in order to pave the way for an approximate evaluation of the partition function we introduce two new lagrange multipliers in the form of two tensorial auxiliary fields .",
    "first of all we define @xmath39 and then @xmath40 we notice immediately these two fundamental identities @xmath41 we thus conclude that @xmath42 is equivalent to @xmath43 introduced in the context of orientationaly independent intrachain interactions @xcite . introducing furthermore the following two additional coupling terms @xmath44 we can write the partition function in the following form @xmath35 { \\cal d}[\\lambda(s ) ] { \\cal d}[g_{ik}(s ) ]   { \\cal d}[{\\cal b}_{ik}(s ) ]   { \\cal d}[p_{ik}(s ) ] { \\cal d}[{\\cal t}_{ik}(s ) ]    ~\\exp{-\\beta \\overline{\\cal h}[{\\bf r}(s ) ] } , \\label{parti}\\ ] ] where the effective hamiltonian @xmath45 $ ] is given by @xmath46   = { \\cal h}[{\\bf r}(s)]+ \\delta { \\cal h}_1[{\\bf r}(s ) ] +   \\delta{\\cal h}_2[{\\bf r}(s ) ] + \\delta{\\cal h}_3[{\\bf r}(s)].\\ ] ] the new auxiliary fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 thus act as tensorial lagrange multipliers setting the constraints @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the new variable space the segment - segment interaction potential can be obtained in a more transparent form as @xmath51 in order to arrive at a more transparetn form of the partition function we furthermore introduce the following two new variables @xmath52 with these new definitions the effective hamiltonian can be finally reduced to this fairly complicated form @xmath53 & = & \\frac{1}{2 } k_c \\int ds ( \\partial^2_s{\\bf r}(s))^2 - \\ul12 \\lambda \\int ds + \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int\\int ds ds ' \\lambda^{(c)}_{ik}(s , s ' )   \\partial_s { \\bf r}_i(s )   \\partial_s { \\bf r}_k(s ) + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int\\int ds ds ' 2 g^{(c)}_{ik}(s , s ' ) { \\bf r}_i(s){\\bf r}_k(s ) - \\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\frac{1}{2 }   \\int\\int ds ds ' g_{ik}(s , s'){\\cal b}_{ik}(s , s ' ) - \\frac{1}{2 } \\int\\int ds ds ' p_{ik}(s , s ' ) { \\cal t}_{ik}(s , s ' ) + \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int\\int ds ds ' v\\left ( { \\cal b}_{ik}(s , s ' ) , { \\cal t}_{ik}(s , s ' ) \\right ) .",

    "it was shown in recent work @xcite that the @xmath0-expansion method , where @xmath54 here and below is the dimensionality of the embedding space , can be fruitfully applied to polymer problems of the above type and we will use our experience gained in the context of monopolar interactions @xcite to tackle also the more complicated case of multipolar interactions as implied by the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ first - ham ] .",
    "our rationale for writing the effective hamiltonian in the form eq . [ first - ham ]",
    "is that it will be shown to be amenable to straightforward approximations leading to a closed form evaluation of the partition function .",
    "similar methods have been already used successfully in the context of monopolar interactions .",

    "[ parti ] , it certainly makes the whole calculation manageable and controllable , reducing its overall complexity to a bare minimum .",
    "the above _ ansatz _ clearly implies also @xmath56 in order to be consistent we must also introduce the same type of _ diagonalization ansatz _ for the fields @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which are conjugate to the fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "[ parti ] would be to trace out the auxiliary fields @xmath77 .",
    "unfortunately these fields enter the effective hamiltonian non - linearly and they can not be simply traced over .",

    "this is consistent with the fact that the original non - interaction part of the hamiltonian contains only euler - kirchhoffian elasticity and is thus at most of fourth order in the @xmath89 space . in this way",
    "we obtain the following expansion @xmath90 as well as @xmath91 thus we have basically derived an expansion also for the self - energy eq .",
    "[ eq.1.2 ] which can now be cast into the form @xmath92 the expansion in @xmath93 to the fourth order thus allows us to introduce the renormalized values of the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 via @xmath96 where we introduced the following two abbreviations @xmath97 at this point we are in a position to evaluate all the @xmath89 integrals in the saddle point equations .",
    "thus instead of eqs . [ eq.1.3 ] , [ eq.1.4 ] and [ eq.1.5 ] we remain with @xmath98 finally we have to address the question of the reference state .",

    "[ saddle ] can be reduced to a rather tame set of formulas @xmath111 these two formulas deserve some interpretation .",
    "the first of the above two equations obviously represents the average size of the chain of contour length @xmath112 since at the saddle point @xmath113 .",
    "it is equal to the usual kratky - porod expression for the average end - end distance squared of a semiflexible chain .",
    "the second equation simply expresses the fact , that for a semiflexible chain the orientational correlation function , which at the saddle point equals @xmath114 , is exponentially decaying with a characteristic length equal to the persistence length .",

    "this can be seen crudely as follows : since the interaction potential for the dipolar chain falls off twice as fast as the monopolar potential the osf reasoning should give for the electrostatic persistence length @xmath170 .",
    "the zero in the exponent translates as usual into the @xmath171 , which is exactly eq .",
    "[ final-1 ] . the way the approximate result eq . [ approx-2 ] fares when compared with the full numerical solution of eq .",
    "[ finaleq ] is shown on fig .",
    "obviously the approximaton is not bad for small enough screening length but becomes progressively worse for larger bare persistence lengths and larger screening .",
    "the same reasoning applied to the general multipole of order @xmath172 would lead to the electrostatic persistence length with scaling @xmath173 .",
    "one can thus hardly expect any electrostatic renormalisation effects above dipolar .",
    "next we consider the case of large(er ) screening lengths . here",
    "the main contribution to the integrals eq .",
    "[ integrals ] along the polyelectrolyte comes from large(er ) length scales . in this case",
    "the local properties of the chain are characterized by an essentially free flight behavior @xcite of the chain , leading to @xmath174 . here",
    "we can derive @xmath175 which leads to the following approximate form of eq .",
    "[ finaleq ] @xmath176 this equation can have two possible solutions depending on the magnitude of @xmath157 .",
    "first of all if @xmath177 , meaning that the value of the persistence length is determined mostly by the electrostatic interactions along the chain , we have @xmath178 this approximate result is nicely exhibited also on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where it is seen how the exact numerical solutions of eq .",
    "[ finaleq ] approach the above scaling limit for sufficiently large values of the screening length with the scaling exponent exactly equal to the above prediction .",
    "the form eq .",
    "[ limit-1 ] is thus a limiting law for the electrostatic part of the persistence length valid universally for large screening lengths .",
    "one should be however aware , that in the above calculation by assumption the length of the chain is always the largest length in the system .    in the other case with a predominant contribution of the bare persistence length , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath179 , thus in the limit where the strength of the dipolar interaction is very small , we end up with the following limiting form @xmath180 the latter is only valid for small enough strength of the dipolar interaction and is difficult to discern in the numerical solution . since all our numerical investigations on figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] are based on the assumption of a fairly large strength of the dipolar interactions , this regime is not distinguishable on the graphs .",
    "these last two results could again be compared with the expressions valid for the monopolar chain in the same regions of the parameter space and derived within the same theoretical framework @xcite . in that case",
    "the behavior of the persistence length at large values of the screening length would be @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is either @xmath183 or @xmath184 , depending on whether @xmath185 is either large or small .",
    "again the difference between these results and eqs .",
    "[ limit-1 ] and [ limit-2 ] is purely due to the swifter decay of the dipolar interaction potential vs. separation ; monopolar case @xmath168 and dipolar case @xmath169 .",
    "this difference introduces an additional factor of @xmath186 into the second term of eq .",
    "[ approx-4 ] , wherefrom the exponents @xmath187 or @xmath10 can be derived straightforwardly .",
    "it is thus clear that the behavior of the electrostatic part of the persistence length of a monopolar and dipolar chain are intimately related in both relevant limits of weak and strong screening .",
    "applying again the same reasoning to the general multipole of order @xmath172 would lead to the electrostatic persistence length with scaling @xmath188 or @xmath189 .",
    "again electrostatic renormalisation effects above dipolar are very small",
    ".    the remaining question in this context would be how robust are the two regimes derived above that lead to the approximate forms eqs .",
    "[ final-1 ] and [ limit-1 ] ? in assessing the range of validity of these different approximations we can invoke a related situation already encountered in the case of a monopolar chain @xcite . in that system extensive simulations",
    "@xcite left no doubt that the osf regime , corresponding in the context of the dipolar chain to eq .",
    "[ final-1 ] , is very robust and extends over a broad region of the parameter phase space .",
    "the sub - osf laws for the electrostatic renormalization of the persistence length giving @xmath8 in the vicinity of @xmath11 were effectively ruled out . translating this into the context of the dipolar chain would make the range of validity fo eq .",
    "[ approx-4 ] fairly narrow .",
    "but these are all conjectures since we are aware of no detailed simulations for semiflexible dipolar chains , setting aside the extensive work by muthukumar on the _ flexible _ chain @xcite , that would match the superb work perfomed recently in the context of the monopolar chain @xcite .",
    "we presented an analysis of the electrostatic contribution to the persistence length of a semiflexible screened - dipolar chain .",
    "the formal context of our analysis is provided by the @xmath0-expansion method that has been already successfully applied to different problems of polymer physics @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-expansion is closely related to different variational schemes that have been amply applied to the problem of electrostatic rigidity of charged polymers @xcite .",
    "what singles out our approach is the fact that we work consistently with a semiflexible hamiltonian and enforce the inextensibility constraint on a global level .",
    "this leads to some discrepancies between variational formulations and @xmath0-expansion method .",
    "however the robustness of the osf regime transpires quite clearly from the @xmath0-expansion in the context of a monopolar polyelectrolyte , giving us some confidence that an analogous result for a dipolar chain would have the same range of validity .",
    "the main step in our formulism was to find an appropriate way to treat the orientational dependence of the intersegment interaction potential .",
    "this has been accomplished by introducing additional auxiliary fields that in their turn lead to new saddle - point equations .",
    "though the derivation of the renormalized elasticity is as a consequence more complicated , it leads to manageable and transparent results . the main conclusion based on these results",
    "would be that the dependence of the electrostatic persistence length on the screening length for a dipolar chain is much less pronounced then for a monopolar chain .",
    "this is clearly seen in the case of large as well as small screening .",
    "also it appears that a semiflexible chain does not give rise to any localized structures as those described by muthukumar @xcite in the context of a flexible chain .",
    "this is indeed not surprising since the chain elasticity is obviously strong enough to prevent extensive looping of the chain that would lead to local aggregation of the chain based on the attractive component of the dipolar interaction .",
    "this attractive component is also not strong enough to lead to any type of phase transition to an ordered state at non - zero temperatures .",
    "this conclusion is just as valid for a semiflexible as it is for a flexible chain .",
    "eventually the conclusions arrived at in this work would have to be tested against extensive simulations just as they were in the case of a monopolar charged chain .",
    "as for the experimental situation where repeated claims of a sub - osf regime have been voiced @xcite , one wonders if they could in fact be a consequence of a specific association of the mobile counterions with fixed charges on the polyelectrolyte backbone producing a system not far from the model dipolar chain analyzed in this work . in order to test this hypothesis",
    "one would have to estimate independently the effective dipole moments of the chain segments .",
    "the results presented in this work could then serve as a guideline to differentiate between monopolar and dipolar osf - like behavior .",
