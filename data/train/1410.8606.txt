    "to study the regions of planetary formation within disks of gas and dust around young stars , we look toward the stars around us in the galaxy to identify those which may offer snapshots of these systems in their various stages of evolution . as these systems age , multiple mechanisms begin to clear their primordial disks of material . because planets may be forming from this material , the details of how and when these disks become cleared are important to understand the origins and evolution of planetary systems .",
    "some of these mechanisms for clearing are accretion onto the central star , photo - evaporation , grain growth and coagulation into larger bodies , and large scale sculpting by orbiting companions . in the absence of strong external illumination by hot nearby stars ,",
    "photo - evaporation may only be responsible for clearing material from the inner regions outward in the disk , and is counteracted by the viscous accretion onto the central star .",
    "the other two mechanisms may operate at any radius within the disk .",
    "@xcite was first to suggest that we should see disks with cleared inner regions  in transition to becoming completely cleared , and leading to the class designation of  transitional \" disks .",
    "these disks have since been confirmed to exist @xcite , and some objects also display evidence in their spectra for the presence of structures inside of these cleared regions , ruling out photo - evaporation as a dominant mechanism for disk clearing .",
    "these objects are designated as  pre - transitional disks \" and are thought to be in earlier stages of evolution compared to the transitional disks @xcite . given their long orbital periods , changes to structures in the outer disk proceed over timescales which may be longer than the lifetime of any single human being .",
    "however , material inside of the gap at small radii may orbit on periods short enough to allow for changes to propagate through the disk and become evident in the spectral energy distribution ( hereafter sed ) over timescales shorter than a decade ( see papers i and ii in this series : @xcite and @xcite , along with @xcite , @xcite , and flaherty et al .",
    "( 2011 and 2012 ) ) .",
    "hence there may not exist one single model which adequately describes some objects , while multiple models of these objects in their different states allow for speculation on the conditions and mechanisms responsible for producing the variable emission , and perhaps insight on the evolution of planet forming regions at approximately terrestrial orbital radii .",
    "additionally , high - contrast imagery has been performed on a number of young stars hosting protoplanetary disks .",
    "these images show structures of disks in various stages of evolution such as rings , gaps , shadows , spirals , asymmetric bright / dark regions , and other features which may be indicative of conditions and perhaps companions within the disk . however , it is not always the case that the structures responsible for producing these features are able to be identified through the images alone . in particular , dark bands which appear to be annular gaps",
    "may in fact be shadows cast by inner disk structures . to determine the true nature of these features",
    ", monte - carlo radiative transfer simulation may first be used to determine the extent of shadows cast by structures which are well constrained by the sed .",
    "once these structures ( and their shadows ) are determined , it is possible to explore the density and scale height conditions which reproduce the gap - like features of the images .",
    "determining which stellar systems possess gaps in their disks may help to select targets for future studies of young planetary systems , and determining the locations and compositions of these gaps may provide direct insight about the conditions of immediate regions of planet formation .",
    "hd 169142 is a 6@xmath10 myr old herbig ae star at a distance of 145 pc which attracts particular interest since it has been identified as hosting a disk with an inner gap comparable to the size of our own solar system ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the disk is in the pre - transitional stage , characterized by emission from warm material close to the central star ( @xmath11 1 au ) as well as emission from cooler material further away from the star , with the inner gap residing between the two rings ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the main disk extends to @xmath0250 au from the central star ( @xcite , @xcite ) and is seen at @xmath013@xmath12 from face - on , making it a good target for imagery of finer structures .",
    "near infrared ( nir ) polarized light images of hd 169142 were obtained in 2011 by @xcite using subaru / hiciao and in 2013 by @xcite using vlt / naco , showing features of the disk that were previously unresolved .",
    "the main structures revealed in these images are depicted in figure 1 .    in these images ,",
    "the inner gap is clearly resolved to a radius of @xmath025 au and appears to be devoid of scattering material , with most of the scattered light emanating from the inner edge of the outer disk .",
    "also visible in the images is a dark annular ring , reportedly located between @xmath040 - 70 au of the central star by quanz et al . and osorio et al . , and between @xmath050 - 80 au by momose et al .",
    "the interior of this region does not appear to be entirely cleared of scattering material ( unlike the gap inside r=25 au ) , as each team detects emission above instrumental detection levels from within the ring .",
    "the feature is confirmed at 7-mm @xcite , indicating that it is at least in part due to a deficit in density extending through the disk mid - plane ( i.e. a second gap ) .",
    "we present an investigation of the hd 169142 system through computer modeling using hochunk3d , a monte - carlo radiative transfer simulation software  described in @xcite . since not all structures are well constrained by the sed alone , to understand these structures within the disk with greater accuracy we pair sed modeling with modeling to fit the observed properties of the multi - band imagery .",
    "we combine modeling of the multi - epoch sed with single epoch multi - band imagery to see what we may learn about the disk and environment of potential planet forming regions in hd 169142 .",
    "hd 169142 was observed using the spex spectrograph @xcite on nasa s infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "the spex observations were obtained using the cross - dispersed ( hereafter xd ) echelle gratings in both short - wavelength mode ( sxd ) covering 0.8 - 2.4 and long - wavelength mode ( lxd ) covering 2.3 - 5.4 .",
    "the lxd data were obtained on 2013 may 15 ( ut ) , and the sxd on 2013 may 16 ( ut ) . for both sets of data ,",
    "a 0.8 arcsec wide slit was used .",
    "the spectra were corrected for telluric extinction , and flux calibrated against the a0v star hd 162220 using the spextool software @xcite running under idl .",
    "the lxd spectrum was merged to the sxd , and required no re - scaling in the wavelength region where they overlapped .    due to",
    "the light loss introduced by the 0.8 arcsec slit used to obtain the xd spectra , changes in telescope tracking and seeing between the observations of hd 169142 and a calibration star may result in merged xd spectrum with a net zero - point shift compared to their true absolute flux values . to correct for any zero - point shift that results from the 0.8 arc sec echelle observations , we also observed hd 169142 on 2013 may 16 ( ut ) with the low dispersion prism in spex using a 3.0 arcsec wide slit . on nights where the seeing is 1.0 arc sec or better",
    ", past experience shows that this technique yields absolute fluxes that agree with aperture photometry to within 5% or better . at the time of the observations , the seeing was @xmath00.7 arc sec . for the prism observations ,",
    "hd 162220 was used as the flux standard . the resulting scaling factor derived for",
    "the echelle spectrum was 0.95 ( shift to fainter absolute fluxes by 5% ) , which has been applied to the data .",
    "we observed hd 169142 with the aerospace corporation s broad - band array spectrograph system ( bass ) on the irtf on 2008",
    "september 4 ( ut ) and 2011 august 1 ( ut ) .",
    "bass uses a fixed circular entrance aperture with a diameter of 1 mm .",
    "gradual improvements in the internal optics have increased the effective projected diameter on the sky using the irtf from  3.4 arcsec in 2008 to  4.4 arcsec in 2011 .",
    "the light then passes through a cold beamsplitter to separate the light into two separate wavelength regimes .",
    "the short - wavelength beam includes light from 2.9 - 6 @xmath1 m , while the long - wavelength beam covers 6 - 13.5 @xmath1 m .",
    "each beam is dispersed onto a 58-element blocked impurity band ( bib ) linear array , thus allowing for simultaneous coverage of the spectrum from 2.9 - 13.5 @xmath1 m .",
    "the spectral resolution @xmath13/@xmath14 is wavelength - dependent , ranging from about 30 to 125 over each of the two wavelength regions @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 boo was used as an absolute flux calibration star for both observations @xcite .",
    "photometric observations of hd 169142 were obtained on 2005 april 30 ( ut ) using the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) instrument on the hubble space telescope .",
    "images were obtained using the f110w in and f171 m filters . for the f171 m data ,",
    "the observations were obtained during target acquisition ( acq mode ) .",

    "the pre-2000 sed consists of photometry from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( observations from 1999 ) , the 2mass all sky point source catalog , and the iras point source catalog , along with iue and iso pht-40 spectroscopy .",
    "despite the presence of gaps in the inner regions of hd 169142 , it is still likely experiencing a modest amount of gas accretion onto the star . using spectra obtained with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ , @xcite derived a mass accretion rate in the 1990s of    m @xmath21 ( 0.7 - 1.8 ) x 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 .    the mass accretion rate at the time of the spex data from 15 - 16 may 2013 ( ut ) can be derived using the net emission from the pa @xmath3 and br @xmath4 lines . in order to do so , we modeled the underlying continuum in a manner described by @xcite . here the underlying emission of the stellar photosphere and dust emission were modeled using a spex spectrum of hd 98058 plus a modified blackbody to represent the dust emission , which were subtracted from the observed spectrum of hd 169142 .",

    "as noted by grady et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the fuv spectrum of hd 169142 is dominated by the stellar photosphere for @xmath24 1600  , and then transitions to a continuum + emission - line spectrum at shorter wavelengths . after smoothing by running boxcar filters , net continuum fluxes in excess of 10@xmath25 erg/@xmath26/s /   are present over the full spectral range of the cos data . following grady et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we compare the smoothed cos data with a ghrs spectrum of altair ( a7vn , v=0.76 , b - v=0.22 ) scaled by @xmath27v only ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the continuum in hd 169142 traces that of the scaled altair data down to 1350   , consistent with a photospheric origin . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "excess continuum light and emission line features are present .",
    "the agreement between the scaled altair spectrum and the cos data demonstrates that there is no measurable selective extinction toward hd 169142 and is fully consistent with sed fitting discussed in @xmath203.3 and @xmath203.4 .      the strongest emission feature in the fuv spectrum of hd 169142 at all 3 epochs is lyman @xmath15 , similar to other late a herbig stars and classical t tauri stars ( france et al . 2014 ) .",
    "lyman @xmath15 emission is detected at all 3 epochs of fuv spectroscopy ( figure 6 ) , with varying amounts of geocoronal contamination affecting @xmath28200 km / s ( cos data ) with much less contamination of the stis data ( within @xmath2840 km / s of line center for the g140 m data ) .",
    "the observed emission profile consists of double - peaked emission , with wings extending to @xmath28900 km / s , and absorption which is not centered on the geocoronal emission or the stellar radial velocity .",
    "there is a factor of 2 change in flux from the april 2013 to july 2013 data , and @xmath29 variability from 2013 july 11 to 2013 july 13 .",
    "variability at this level is similar to that previously reported for other well - studied herbig stars such as hd 163296 and hd 104237 .",
    "the stis g140 m data reveal a spatially unresolved source in both the continuum and in the emission lines .",
    "the stis data show saturated absorption in the geocoronal feature to + 140 km / s , consistent with interstellar and/or circumstellar h i absorption corresponding to n(h i )  2.5 - 5@xmath30 @xmath31 , or e(b - v)=0.01 for gas to dust ratios typical of the diffuse ism .",
    "none of the lyman @xmath15 profiles show a sharp emission feature similar to the jet emission seen in hd 163296 or hd 104237 , so we interpret the blue shifted absorption as evidence for a stellar wind , but not a jet .",
    "we measure the terminal velocity of the wind at the 50% of peak blue emission level as ranging from -364 to -525 km / s .      in investigating the structures within the protoplanetary disk in hd 169142",
    ", we present several distinct models corresponding to the two states of the sed . since high contrast and angular resolution imagery dating from the pre-2000 era",
    "is unavailable , we explore both states in reverse chronological order , beginning with modeling the post-2000 state of the broadband sed and multi - band imagery , which we describe in detail in this subsection . later , we adapt this model into a set of three models which match the pre-2000 sed and explore several speculative scenarios for disk structures at sub - au radii .",
    "the hochunk3d software allows for two separate disks ( each with two coexisting grain populations ) , one gap ( with its own density and scale height profiles ) , and an envelope .",
    "usually , one disk is dedicated to small grains and the other dedicated to large , settled grains  usually with coplanar geometries .",
    "however , to model a dual - gapped nature of hd 169142 , the available disks were constructed as follows : the first disk was adopted for the optically thick inner disk beginning at 0.23 au and ending at 0.27 au .",
    "the second disk was adopted as the 25 au ring and outer disk , with the second gap placed between 35 - 70 au .",
    "figure 7 details the location of the disk components in the post-2000 model , whose sed is presented in figure 8 .",
    "the full scope of the parameter space explored and the values used in construction of the post-2000 model are detailed in appendix a. where available , parameter values were adopted from previous studies , indicated in table a1 by their references .    in attempting to fit the sed and imaging available for hd 169142 , we place constraints on several disk geometries and structures .",
    "first , models without an inner disk fail to reproduce the observed nir flux levels .",
    "this requires the presence of material close to the central star , as suggested by @xcite and others that the protoplanetary disk around hd 169142 belongs to the class of objects known as pre - transitional disks @xcite .",
    "for the outer disk grain population , we have used model 1 from @xcite , which includes a mixture of amorphous carbon and astronomical silicates with a maximum grain radius of 1 mm , but which does not produce a strong 10 @xmath1 m silicate emission band . to remain consistent with an  inside - out \" profile of grain growth ( see @xcite ) , we have used model 3 from @xcite for the mid - plane of our inner ( sub - au ) disk , which similarly has a maximum grain radius of 1 mm , but with a size distribution resulting in a population of larger grains than in the outer regions of the disk . the emission from pahs in the disk do not exhibit a variable emission profile similar to the underlying continuum between 1.5 - 10 @xmath1 m ( see spitzer / irs and iso / pht-40 data , figure 3 ) , suggesting little to no pahs within the variable inner disk . hence we include these molecules in the outer ( 25 - 250 au region ) .",
    "the envelope was adopted as a disk - like optically thin body of material suspended above and below the optically thick mid - plane of the inner disk ( see figure 7 ) . in order to explore the source of the nir variability , it was necessary that the changes between pre-2000 and post-2000 models occur primarily within this optically thin structure , as changes to the inner edge of the optically thick mid - plane produce variable shadowing of the outer disk , which is non - evident in the available data in the broadband sed .",
    "interestingly , an optically - thin composition of large grains ( as expected of an  inside - out \" way of grain growth ) fails to reproduce the amount of nir emission without being placed within the dust sublimation radius .",
    "however , an optically - thin component of smaller grains ( 0.005 - 1 micron ) succeeds at reproducing the observed emissions while remaining outside of the sublimation radius .",
    "the unexpected presence of these small grains at such altitude above the inner disk may hint at impacts or other debris - creating processes occurring within the inner regions of the disk , unless the grain growth and formation of the mid - plane is simply of very recent occurrence .",
    "the profile of the outer disk emission very closely resembles the peak of a single temperature black - body of t=120 k , which is consistent with most of the emission originating from the inner wall of the outer disk , and allows us to place constraints on its structure .",
    "first , the sed is best fit by placing this wall at 25@xmath282 au , as suggested by previous modeling studies and imaging ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "next , values are obtained for the a and b parameters , respectively the power law exponents for the radial density ( @xmath32 ) and scale height ( @xmath33 ) of the outer disk , which largely impact the width and height of the emission profile . there",
    "exist several degenerate solutions for these parameters in combination with the disk mass . out of these ,",
    "the disk mass is most constrained by the sed .",
    "disk masses @xmath110.0015 m@xmath7 fall short of reproducing the observed emissions at @xmath3460@xmath1 m , while disk masses @xmath350.003 m@xmath7 produce too much emission at @xmath3460@xmath1 m .",
    "a disk mass of 0.003 m@xmath7 reproduces the 60 @xmath1 m iras , 100 @xmath1 m iras , and 160 @xmath1 m akari / fis , but not the 90 @xmath1 m or 140 @xmath1 m akari / fis . since the density of data in this portion of the spectrum is relatively low , and since the emissions at these wavelengths should not be significantly variable over the period of the observations , we have chosen to fit to the iras and 160 @xmath1 m akari / fis points , as m@xmath36 = 0.003 m@xmath7 is consistent with the lower estimates of other studies ( e.g. @xcite , who obtained m@xmath370.005@xmath280.002 m@xmath7 ) .",
    "however , we find that 0.0015 m@xmath38 m@xmath39 0.0025 m@xmath7 may reproduce emissions consistent with the 90 @xmath1 m and 140 @xmath1 m akari / fis points as well as the 50 @xmath1 m photometry in @xcite .",
    "since most of the flux between @xmath015 - 40 @xmath1 m is from the 25 au wall , there exists another degeneracy between the scale height normalization and the flare of the disk , as only the height of the wall is most constrained by the sed .",
    "the h - band imagery and their corresponding surface brightness profiles allow us to explore beyond this degeneracy , as the regions outside of the 25 au wall are resolved to have observable structure .",
    "since the scale height normalization of the 25 - 250 au structures is the same throughout ( given our use of the available disk structures , see above ) , modifying the disk flare exponent in conjunction with the scale height normalization is our only means to adjust the height of the @xmath4070 au structures without affecting the height of the 25 au wall .",
    "we find that the sed and images may be simultaneously reproduced with a disk flare @xmath41 @xmath42 for all structures where r@xmath4325 au .",
    "unfortunately , without additional disk structures being available in the 2014 - 01 - 31 release of the code , this eliminates our ability to explore the possibility that these regions may have independent geometries , or perhaps ones different than those necessary for our constructions ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite suggest flares proportional to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively ) .",
    "nevertheless , our models do maintain agreement with the sed , h - band surface brightness profile , and integrated disk flux percentages , and hence suggest that the values used in this study are entirely plausible .",
    "@xcite reports a surface brightness profile behaving as @xmath46 in the regions where r@xmath1152 au and r@xmath3581 au and suggest that a surface density profile proportional to @xmath47 could reproduce the observed surface brightness .",
    "@xcite reports a better fit to their data with a broken power law exponent of @xmath48 for the region between 85 - 120 au and an exponent of @xmath49 for the region between 120 - 250 au , suggesting the presence of additional discontinuities to the disk surface .",
    "hence there is no exact agreement between the observations , although an approximate @xmath46 fall off seems well established between 80 - 120 au . while maintaining fits to the sed , we find that a disk flare @xmath41 @xmath42 and density profile at the mid - plane @xmath41 @xmath47 reproduce an h - band surface brightness profile of @xmath50 between 80 - 200 au , while we may reproduce a steeper surface brightness profile @xmath51 with a steeper fall off to the mid - plane density @xmath52 .",
    "given the available disk structures in the code ,",
    "we were not able to explore additional discontinuities in the disk surface to match a steeper fall off outward of 120 au . hence we have chosen to match the surface brightness profile of the brightest inner portion by including the @xmath47 radial density profile between 25 - 250 au in the final form of our post-2000 model .",
    "note that as a result our model image which appears later in the article ( figure 10 , center ) appears brighter in the outermost regions of the disk than the @xcite image with the same scaling of intensity by @xmath53 .",
    "since the surface brightness profile between @xmath040 - 70 au requires a separate in - depth treatment of this region , we present our complete model surface brightness profile later in figure 11 .",
    "one of the most striking features present in the multi - band images of the disk in hd 169142 is a second dark ring located between @xmath040 - 70 au ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , in addition to the @xmath00.3 - 25 au gap that is heavily discussed in the literature ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such a feature in the nir images may be either the result of shadows cast by the wall at @xmath025 au or the signature of a second gap  one which is not so devoid of material as the gap inward of 25 au as @xmath014% of the integrated disk flux emanates from this region @xcite . using the vla , @xcite detect 7 mm emission concentrated between @xmath025 - 40 au , although much more asymmetric than the nir emission ring .",
    "as the 7 mm emissions penetrate deep within the disk detecting the thermal emissions of large dust grains , this result indicates that this is a true density feature which extends through the mid - plane of the disk .",
    "hence any shadows cast by inner structures must be in addition to effects caused by the density feature .    to explore the extent that shadows may be contributing to the nir dark ring , we present three separate models .",
    "the first model does not contain any region - specific modifications to the density or scale height profile in the region of the second gap .",
    "this model is in attempt to determine the scale height of the 25 au wall and other structures which are constrained by the sed , and to see whether or not the second dark ring appears naturally as a shadow in the model images .",
    "although this model reproduces the observed sed , no second dark ring is present in the images ( figure 9 , left ) .",
    "thus , we explore the density conditions which may reproduce this feature .",
    "we find that the integrated h - band flux percentages ( 49% bright ring - 14% dark ring - 37% outer disk ) reported in @xcite may be reproduced to within 2% by scaling the density between 35 - 70 au by 0.3@xmath54 the value just outside of 70 au ( figure 9 , center ) .",
    "however , we also find that decreasing the scale height of the 35 - 70 au region by 0.86@xmath54 may also reproduce the observed nir integrated flux percentages and radial brightness profile .",
    "hence there may exist a multitude of models fitting the nir images with a gap density change of @xmath55 and a scale height change of @xmath56 .",
    "however , lacking the correct density structure at the mid - plane , many of these models would fail to reproduce the observed lack of 7 mm emission from the gap ( see figure 9 , right ) .",
    "this degeneracy too may be overcome by modeling to fit the nir and 7 mm images simultaneously , although this is beyond the scope of our study at this stage .",
    "similarly , future acquisition of multi - band imagery will help to constrain the density and location of various grain species throughout the disk .",
    "we leave the density / scale height degeneracy to be resolved in future studies and include only a density scaling to the gap in our final model .",
    "furthermore , we find that a density profile @xmath57 in the gap produces a surface brightness profile in the region following a power law of @xmath58 , as opposed to the observed profile of @xmath46 reported in @xcite .",
    "since a significant amount of radiation is back - scattered off of the 70 au wall , we find that a steeper density profile @xmath52 inside of the gap is necessary to reproduce the @xmath46 surface brightness fall off . thus our final h - band ( 2.2 @xmath1 m ) model image of the post-2000 state ( figure 10 , center ) highly resembles those taken through the actual telescopes with a surface brightness profile ( figure 11 ) which is closely described by a power law of @xmath46 where r@xmath1150 au and @xmath50 where r@xmath3580 au .      as detailed in section 2.5 , our construction of the sed reveals variability in the nir spectrum , specifically at wavelengths between 1.5 - 10 @xmath1 m .",
    "measurements fall into two distinct flux states , with those recorded after the year 2000 exhibiting up to 45% lower nir flux than those recorded prior to 2000 , with the change occurring over no more than 10 years ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "we present three models corresponding to the pre-2000 state of the disk in hd 169142 .",
    "model a explains the nir variability by changing the location of the outer edge of the inner disk , model b by changing the altitude and density of the mini - envelope , and model c by the variable density of the mini - envelope alone .",
    "we have restricted changes in model structures to the inner regions due to the difficulty for changes to propagate through the outer structures faster than their orbital periods , which would certainly be longer than the observed timescale of @xmath0 10 yr .",
    "note that changing the location of the outer edge of the optically thick mid - plane does not affect the shadowing of the outer disk , and contributes to the nir variability since it is being heated by the optically thin envelope .",
    "it is also interesting to note that even in our most extreme scenarios , the change to the envelope mass accounts for less than 1% of the mass lost due to accretion ( @xmath59 over the maximum timescale of 10 years ) .",
    "hence the optically thick mid - plane is a necessary component of our model constructions to explain the accretion rate . for comparison ,",
    "the cross - sectional density distribution of the sub - au regions of each model are presented in figure 12 , which we now discuss .      in this model",
    "the pre-2000 nir sed is achieved through extending the outer edge of the inner disk and mini - envelope to 0.285 au and 0.32 au , respectively ( see model sed in figure 13 and density profile in figure 12 ) .",
    "chronologically from this model to the post-2000 model , these correspond to an inward shift of 0.015 au for the optically thick disk and 0.05 au for the optically thin envelope .",
    "changes analogous to these might occur in systems in which the inner disk is actively being cleared of material by accretion onto the central star and/or through gravitational sculpting by a planetary mass companion orbiting within the gap ( see  4.2 ) . to keep the density of the inner disk consistent with that of the post-2000 model",
    ", the fraction of mass in the inner disk was adjusted accordingly to 7.1@xmath60 m@xmath36 , as opposed to the value of 5.0@xmath60 m@xmath36 in the post-2000 model .",
    "these correspond to a net change in mass for the mid - plane of 6.3@xmath61 m@xmath7 and for the envelope of 4.0@xmath62 m@xmath7 .      in this model",
    "the pre-2000 nir state is achieved through increasing the scale height of the mini - envelope by + 0.07 au and doubling its density to a uniform 5@xmath5410@xmath25 g @xmath63 , as compared to the post-2000 model ( see model sed in figure 14 and density profile in figure 12 ) .",
    "these changes correspond to a mass loss of 6.6@xmath62 m@xmath7 from the envelope in going from this model to the post-2000 state . to account for the mass lost due to accretion of @xmath02@xmath61 m@xmath7 ( obtained using our derived accretion rate over 10 years )",
    ", we have adjusted the fraction of mass in the inner disk to 5.58@xmath60 , as opposed to the value of 5@xmath60 used in the post-2000 model .",
    "the magnitude of an altitude change alone necessary to reproduce the observed flux levels would effectively constitute a halo in the high flux state , and its unlikely near - complete disappearance in the low flux state .",
    "hence in this model we have chosen to vary both the altitude and the density of the mini - envelope simultaneously .",
    "changes analogous to these might occur in systems in which material is suspended at higher altitude in the pre-2000 state as opposed to the post-2000 state , perhaps due to an inner disk wind or other phenomena within the inner regions ( see  4.2 ) .      in this model",
    "the pre-2000 nir state is achieved through increasing the density of the mini - envelope alone to a uniform 10@xmath64 g @xmath63 , which corresponds to a mass loss of 7.2@xmath62 m@xmath7 ( see model sed in figure 15 and density profile in figure 12 ) .",
    "again , to account for the mass lost due to accretion of @xmath02@xmath61 m@xmath7 , we have adjusted the fraction of mass in the inner disk to 5.67@xmath60 , as opposed to the value of 5@xmath60 used in the post-2000 model .",
    "while this change in density may plausibly be due to accretion onto the central star , such a dramatic change in density to the structures at high altitude produces variable shadowing ( and thus emission ) of the outer disk .",
    "we present this model solely as a means of narrowing down where and how the changes must be taking place within the sub - au structures .",
    "our primary finding is that the protoplanetary disk in hd 169142 possesses material that is within 1 au the star and undergoing changes to its structure on the order of a decade .",
    "a simple way to reduce the nir flux from observed pre-2000 levels to post-2000 levels is to reduce the scale height of the innermost edge of the disk .",
    "however , such a change would decrease the shadowing of the outer disk , and hence produce an anti - correlated variability of the inner and outer disk emissions , which is non - evident in the sed .",
    "hence , we have included in each of our models an optically thin population of small grains enveloping the optically thick sub - au mid - plane .",
    "changes to this optically thin structure do not produce major variations in the shadowing of the outer disk .",
    "the presence of such a structure is consistent with the results of @xcite who find that more realistic models of inner dust rims are insufficient to match  bump \"- like nir emission , as well as the results of @xcite who suggests that the standard puffed - up inner disk rims are insufficient to explain the nir excess of many herbig ae and related stars and that additional sources of nir emission must be present .",
    "we find three scenarios for the sub - au structures in the pre-2000 ( high nir flux ) state , one of which we may almost entirely exclude ( model c ) as it produces variable shadowing of the outer disk .",
    "we find nothing in the data to prefer either of the two remaining plausible scenarios over the other , although the changes between pre-2000 b @xmath65 post-2000 are much more dramatic than the changes between pre-2000 a @xmath65 post-2000 . in the scenario of our pre-2000 model a @xmath65 post-2000 model , the nir variability is explained through an inward shift of the outer edge of the sub - au structures toward the central star  through accretion onto the star and perhaps other means . in the other scenario ( model b @xmath65 post-2000 state ) , the nir variability is explained through the continual vertical evacuation of material from the sub - au structures , leaving the post-2000 sub - au structures with a smaller vertical scale height than those structures in the pre-2000 state . while these two scenarios accurately reproduce observed pre-2000 nir flux levels through physically plausible mechanisms , we stress that the sed is highly degenerate to other structures and there exists a noteworthy potential for other presently unimagined possibilities .    furthermore , we find that the dark ring observed between @xmath040 - 70 au in the polarized flux images is not the result of shadows cast by inner disk structures which are well constrained by the sed . instead , we find that this feature may be reproduced in the model images through scaling the density of the region by 0.3@xmath54 the value just outside of the gap , which is consistent with the density structure inferred through the 7 mm observations of @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the h - band images may also be reproduced by adjusting the scale height of the region by 0.86@xmath54 the value just outside of the gap . hence",
    ", further study of the multi - band imagery is necessary here to eliminate the degeneracy of these parameters and determine the true composition of the various dust grain sizes throughout the disk .",
    "extending to a distance comparable to between the orbits of uranus and neptune in our own solar system , the @xmath00.3 - 25 au gap in the protoplanetary disk in hd 169142 is temptingly explained through the clearing of material by planetary mass companions .",
    "however , there are other mechanisms which are likely to produce the inferred disk structure and which must be accounted for before we may speculate on which ( if any ) features may be the signature of young and forming planets .",
    "additionally , the timescale on which these mechanisms act to clear regions of the disk is of importance as the potential for planetary formation is significantly diminished with the decreasing supply of material . in a general overview of the evolution of protoplanetary disks ,",
    "@xcite suggest that viscous accretion first dominates over photo - evaporation , until the mass accretion rate drops to @xmath66 .",
    "once these two counteracting processes become active on the same order of magnitude , the viscous flow of material from the outer disk will no longer be able to resupply the inner disk of material lost due to photo - evaporation , and an inner hole will be cleared . through analysis of the pa @xmath3 and br @xmath4 lines present in the may 2013 spex observations we derive a mass accretion rate of m @xmath5 @xmath67 .",
    "hence this accretion rate suggests that such a scenario may be an active clearing mechanism for the inner ( @xmath68 au ) gap .",
    "should this be the case , we may consider these to be ongoing processes within the presently observed state of the disk , as nir flux levels ( as of 2013 ) demand for the presence of material at sub - au radii .",
    "such a scenario is consistent with our speculative changes responsible for producing the variable nir emission ( see pre-2000 model a , in which the decrease in nir flux is explained through the shift of material inward toward the star , with a net mass loss of 6.3@xmath61m@xmath7 ) .",
    "we may also assume that the disk clearing mechanisms of grain - growth and coagulation into larger bodies , as well as large - scale sculpting by newly formed planets , may also be responsible for producing these observed structures .",
    "in fact , the results of our pre-2000 model a are suggestive that such additional clearing may plausibly be occurring , as our derived mass accretion rate accounts for as much as 2.7@xmath61m@xmath7 , or 43% of the total mass cleared over the observed timescale of the decrease in flux .",
    "this would leave room for other mechanisms to be actively clearing the region on the same order of magnitude as accretion onto the star .",
    "should a scenario such as this actually be underway , we could perhaps expect to see complete disappearance of the inner disk in hd 169142 on the order of another decade or so , prompting a change of class from pre - transitional to transitional disk .    while the nir variability may be explained through the above scenario , there exists potential for other possibilities .",
    "another scenario in which the nir variability may be reproduced is one in which the optically thin envelope extends to higher altitude in the pre-2000 state than in the post-2000 state , as explored in our pre-2000 model b. this scenario matches pre-2000 nir flux levels with a shifting of the envelope by 0.07 au in the vertical direction and doubling its density as compared to the post-2000 model . while determining the exact mechanism and situations for which such a scenario may be relevant are beyond the scope of this paper , one likely possibility is that reconnection events ( like those present in the model of @xcite ) may be occurring within the magnetic field of a partially ionized inner disk , resulting in material which is lofted at altitude above the mid - plane .",
    "such proceedings would also help to explain the presence of the optically thin material which has been necessary throughout our constructions .",
    "similar considerations were explored for hd 163296 and hd 31648 in @xcite , and the migration of material at altitude above the inner disk was explored as a mechanism for producing the photometric variability observed in hd 163296 @xcite . however , given the chronology of the observed states , such a scenario would have material decreasing in altitude by 0.07 au and decreasing in density by a factor of 2 between the pre-2000 state and the post-2000 state .",
    "these changes , as well as those between our pre-2000 model c and post-2000 model are much more dramatic than those between the pre-2000 a and post-2000 models , and thus by invoking occam s razor we consider the chronology of our pre-2000 model a @xmath65 post-2000 model as being the most favorable of our presented scenarios .",
    "we obtain a null result for the dark ring between @xmath040 - 70 au being a shadow cast by inner structures , but rather we find that this feature may be reproduced in the model images by a net deficit in the density of scattering material in the region .",
    "hence we are left with the problem of how such structure in the disk might have originated and evolved from the primordial disk . again",
    ", large - scale sculpting by planetary mass companions is temptingly invoked as a mechanism for clearing this gap of material  especially given its location beyond the snow - line and the large amount of gas available here for giant planet production .",
    "another possibility is that grain growth and coagulation may have been active within the region  resulting in a net decrease in the density of micron sized grains and a corresponding increase in the density of grains with millimeter cross - sections .",
    "however , this seems unlikely as the 7 mm emissions suggest that the largest grains are concentrated within the @xmath025 - 40 au region , and not within the gap @xcite .",
    "this result is also consistent with a planet - induced dust filtration process ( as in @xcite ) being responsible for clearing of this gap , as in such a scenario the small grains should remain in the cavity while the millimeter sized grains are trapped at the edge . given the presence of large structures at smaller radii , photoevaporation falls even shorter of explaining the origin of this second gap .",
    "likewise , viscous flows of material to smaller radii seem unlikely , as this would raise new questions of why such a mechanism has preferentially cleared this region but not those at immediately larger or smaller radii .",
    "hence we are left to consider the intriguing and seemingly likely possibility that this second gap is a direct result of the formation of planets and their ongoing sculpting of this region of the disk .",
    "finally , there exists the possibility for the presence of multiple orbiting companions which may be responsible for the clearing of material , as well as sending material into orbit at altitude above the mid - plane ( which may explain the origin of the mini - envelope that we have found to be a necessary component ) .",
    "such companions may be on highly eccentric orbits , and at the inner parts of their orbits may travel close enough to perturb the sub - au disk structures on periods consistent with the @xmath010 yr timescale of the change in nir emission .",
    "furthermore , @xcite & @xcite have reported the independent l detection of planet - candidates respectively at separations of @xmath00.11  and 0.156\"@xmath280.032  from the star . at a distance of 145 pc",
    ", these angular separations correspond to physical separations of @xmath016 au and 22.7@xmath284.7 au , placing them within the inner gap . both teams present observations lacking corresponding detections of the l hot - spots at shorter wavelengths , thus inferring their origin as sub - stellar .",
    "however , each team detects only one hot - spot , at differing radii , magnitude , and position - angle .",
    "hence the validation of these planet - candidates presently remains open to skepticism .",
    "incidentally , neither team detected l counterpart emission from the compact 7 mm source in @xcite . at 7 mm",
    "the disk is optically thin , raising the possibility of a chance coincidence with a background object . to be compelling",
    ", the l candidates need to be recovered again , and also seen in other filters ( such as 3.1 microns ) .",
    "nevertheless , the structures within the disk provide compelling evidence of planetary interactions and warrant the continued observation of the hd 169142 system as a candidate for the direct imaging of young extra - solar planets .",
    "our assembly of the broadband sed from data sets covering a quarter of a century reveals variability of up to 45% at nir wavelengths over a maximum timescale of 10 years . through modeling of the sed we",
    "confirm several scenarios where changes to the inner ( sub - au ) structures may reproduce the two distinct states of the nir spectrum .",
    "the simplest of these involves a shift of the outer edge of the inner disk by @xmath00.05 au inward toward the star . in this scenario",
    "we have kept the density of the mid - plane the same by adjusting the total mass of the inner disk by 6.3@xmath61m@xmath7 to account for the decrease in volume . from the spex observations we derive a mass acrretion rate of m @xmath5 ( 1.5 - 2.7 ) x 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 , which accounts for as much as 43% of the total mass change in the above scenario , and",
    "is suggestive that other processes ( such as sculpting due to planets near the inner edge of the gap ) may be active in addition to accretion onto the star .",
    "however , we find that the pre-2000 sed may be equally reproduced if the density of the inner disk is allowed to increase , allowing for the change in mass to be equivalent to that lost due to accretion . in any event , we do not observe any variable shadowing of the outer disk , requiring that changes must be occurring within the outer edge of the inner disk , or to an optically thin structure above / below the mid - plane . in order to reproduce the level of variability we have found that the latter structure is a necessary component to provide heating of the outer portions of the inner disk , and is similar to components present in the models and predictions in other studies on related objects ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    through a combination of modeling the broadband sed and multi - band imagery",
    "we explore the structures of the outer disk and in particular the nature of the second gap detected in the h - band by @xcite and @xcite , and at 7 mm by @xcite .",
    "our models suggest that this ring in the nir is not significantly in part caused by shadows cast by inward disk structures . instead , we find that the dark ring in the nir may be reproduced by a 0.3@xmath54 scaling of density or a 0.86@xmath54 scaling of the height within the region . as a density feature",
    "is required to match the 7 mm observations , we find that a model fitting the images at both bands is possible with a density scaling @xmath55 and a height scaling of @xmath56 , which we leave for future studies to explore with the hopeful acquisition of additional mm - continuum imagery . in any event , this structure is highly suggestive of planetary formation within the region .",
    "we find that the most constrained outer disk structure in the sed is a wall at @xmath025 au , whose emission resembles a nearly single temperature black - body with t=120k .",
    "while maintaining fits to the sed , we find that the h - band polarized surface brightness profile @xmath69 between 85 - 120 au @xcite may be reproduced by a radial density profile @xmath57 and a scale height exponent @xmath70 , while a steeper profile @xmath51 may be reproduced with a steeper fall off to the density @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , we find that a density profile @xmath52 in the 35 - 70 au gap reproduces the observed surface brightness profile @xmath51 reported by @xcite for the region where r@xmath1150 au .    finally , we conclude that the protoplanetary disk in hd 169142 is home to a multitude of structures which may indicate the activity of planetary formation processes , and perhaps even that the effects of such processes may be visible over a single person s lifetime . at the very least ,",
    "it offers a unique perspective on the timescales and mechanisms by which such disks become cleared of material , and hence when and how planets have the opportunity to form . in any event , hd 169142 is a highly structured and evolving system , of which continued observation and investigation may reveal further details , as well as answer important questions about the formation and evolution of young planetary systems .",

    "<S> we present near - ir and far - uv observations of the pre - transitional ( gapped ) disk in hd 169142 using nasa s infrared telescope facility and hubble space telescope . the combination of our data along with existing data sets into the broadband spectral energy distribution reveals variability of up to 45% between @xmath01.5 - 10 @xmath1 m over a maximum timescale of 10 years . </S>",
    "<S> all observations known to us separate into two distinct states corresponding to a high near - ir state in the pre-2000 epoch and a low state in the post-2000 epoch , indicating activity within the @xmath21 au region of the disk . through analysis of the pa @xmath3 and br @xmath4 lines in our data we derive a mass accretion rate in may 2013 of m @xmath5 ( 1.5 - 2.7 ) x 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> . we present a theoretical modeling analysis of the disk in hd 169142 using monte - carlo radiative transfer simulation software to explore the conditions and perhaps signs of planetary formation in our collection of 24 years of observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that shifting the outer edge ( @xmath9 au ) of the inner disk by 0.05 au toward the star ( in simulation of accretion and/or sculpting by forming planets ) successfully reproduces the shift in nir flux . </S>",
    "<S> we establish that the @xmath040 - 70 au dark ring imaged in the nir by @xcite and @xcite and at 7 mm by @xcite may be reproduced with a 30% scaled density profile throughout the region , strengthening the link to this structure being dynamically cleared by one or more planetary mass bodies . </S>"
