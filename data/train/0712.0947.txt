    "we observe the expected growth of particle multiplicities and the increase of the flow , resulting in smaller slope of the @xmath8-spectra .",
    "the elliptic flow of pions does not increase any more , showing the expected saturation of @xmath4 , and even decreases slightly at the highest tested temperature of @xmath23  mev . the hbt radii increase moderately with the temperature : @xmath18 and @xmath20 roughly 1  fm for each 100  mev increase of @xmath2 , and @xmath19 even slower .",
