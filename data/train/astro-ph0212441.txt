    "dwarf galaxies in our local universe are ideal laboratories for studying the interplay between the ism and star formation in low - metallicity environments ( hunter & gallagher 1989 ) .",
    "they are at relatively early epochs of their chemical evolution , possibly resembling distant protogalaxies in their early stages of star formation .",
    "although only a few metal - poor galaxies have been observed in the mir using iso , the characteristics of the mir dust components appear to differ remarkably from those of normal - metallicity starbursts ( madden 2000 ) . whether this is an abundance or composition effect is not yet clear .    for this reason",
    ", we are studying their detailed luminosity budget by modeling their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from optical to millimeter wavelengths , thereby constructing templates to study conditions in primordial galaxies to help to constrain galaxy evolution models .",
    "the galaxy we present here is ngc  1569 .",
    "it is a hi - rich , metal - poor ( @xmath0 ) dwarf irregular galaxy which lies near the galactic plane at a distance of @xmath1 ( israel 1988 ) .",
    "ngc  1569 is presently in the aftermath of a massive burst of star formation ( israel 1988 , israel & de bruyn 1988 , waller 1991 ) and exhibits very compact hii regions and 2 super - star - clusters ( hunter et al 2000 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : obs ] shows some of our broadband images of ngc  1569 with isocam and scuba .",
    "the isocam  7.75  @xmath2 band traces the aromatic bands ( pah ) and the scuba band traces the cold grain continuum .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      figure [ fig : cvf ] shows the isocam cvf spectrum for ngc  1569 . compared to a normal disk galaxy , there are very strong ionic lines due to o - b stars .",
    "the ratio @xmath3/[neii ] } \\sim 10 $ ] limits the age of the stellar clusters to @xmath4  5  myr .",
    "there are weak aromatic bands , probably due to the destruction of the carriers as a consequence of the hard penetrating radiation field in the low - metallicity environement .",
    "moreover , there s a very steeply rising continuum due to very small grains emission ( see the the dsert et al ( 1990 ) model ) which are stochastically heated .",
    "the dsert et al ( 1990 ) model empirically computes the dust emissivity from near - infrared to submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "it is a coherent interpretation of both the interstellar extinction and the infrared emission .",
    "the emission originates from three different components : the pah ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ) which are aromatic 2-dimensional molecules producing the fuv non - linear part of the extinction curve , the vsg ( very small grains ) which are 3-dimensional carbon grains apparently responsible for the absorption bump at 217.5 nm , the bg ( big grains ) which are 3-dimensional silicate grains explaining the nir and visible rise of the extinction curve .",
    "each component is described by four parameters : a minimum and maximum grain size ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , a power - law index , @xmath7 , for the size distribution and a scaling factor which is the mass abundance relative to hydrogen ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the number density of grains of radius between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",
    "we model the sed of this galaxy , fitting the dsert et al ( 1990 ) dust model to our observations ( broadbands and spectrum ) .",
    "we make the link between the stellar radiation field and the full dust spectrum by modeling the stellar populations with pegase ( fioc , rocca - volmerange , 1997 ) using uv to nir data from the literature and mir ionic lines as a further constraint .",
    "we then use our modeled stellar radiation field as input to the dust model .    to obtain the best @xmath12 fit ,",
    "we vary different parameters of the model : the mass abundances ( @xmath13 ) , the minimum and maximum sizes ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , except @xmath14 ) , assuming the continuity of the size distribution , and the extinction of the synthesized radiation field .",
    "however , if we try to fit our data with only the three components , there remains a submillimetre excess we ca nt explain .",
    "we decide to add a fourth component corresponding probably to very cold grains ( vcgs ) , modeled by a black body with an emissivity index @xmath15 to reproduce this excess and to obtain a correct fit varying the mass abundance of this component .",
    "finally we get @xmath16 for 15 data points and 8 free parameters .",
    "all the parameters used are summarized in the following table and compared to the values for the milky - way .",
    "the best fit we obtained is shown on figure [ fig : sed ] .     & milky & ngc & milky & ngc & milky & ngc & & ngc + & way & 1569 & way & 1569 & way & 1569 & & 1569 + @xmath13 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath13 & @xmath23 + @xmath5 & 4 @xmath24 & 4 @xmath24 & 12 @xmath24 & 37 @xmath24 & 150 @xmath24 & 47 @xmath24 & t & 7 k + @xmath6 & 12 @xmath24 & 37 @xmath24 & 150 @xmath24 & 47 @xmath24 & 1100 @xmath24 & 8500 @xmath24 & @xmath15 & 1.0 + @xmath7 & 3 & 3 & 2.6 & 2.6 & 2.9 & 2.9 & +",
