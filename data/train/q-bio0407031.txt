    "in the modeling of biological processes , dynamical networks play an important role .",
    "metabolic processes of living beings are networks , the nodes being the substrates , which are linked together whenever they participate in the same biochemical reaction .",
    "protein - protein as well as gene expression and regulation are also dynamical networks .    a central role in the analysis of biological networks is played by the oriented circuits also called _ feedback loops _ [ snoussi & thomas , 1993 ] ,",
    "[ thomas et al . , 1995 ] .",
    "feedback loops are positive or negative according to whether they have an even or odd number of negative interactions .",
    "the general understanding is that positive loops generate multistability and negative loops generate homeostasis , that is , the variables in the loop tend to middle range values , with or without oscillations [ snoussi , 1998 ] , [ gouz , 1998 ] .",
    "an interesting situation , not much studied yet , arises when positive and negative loops interact and control each other . here",
    ", one such network is studied . besides its interest as a dynamical system , it also tries to capture some of the features of the p53 network .",
    "the p53 gene was one of the first tumour - suppressor genes to be identified , its protein acting as an inhibitor of uncontrolled cell growth .",
    "the p53 protein has been found not to be acting properly in most human cancers , due either to mutations in the gene or inactivation by viral proteins or inhibiting interactions with other cell products ( there are however a number of cases where apparently normal p53 does not to achieve tumour control ) . apparently not required for normal growth and development , p53 is critical in the prevention of tumour development , contributing to dna repair , inhibiting angiogenesis and growth of abnormal or stressed cells [ may & may , 1999 ] [ vogelstein et al . , 2000 ]",
    "[ woods & vousden , 2001 ] [ taylor et al . , 1999 ]",
    "[ vousden , 2000 ] .",
    "in addition to its beneficial anticancer activities it may also have some detrimental effects in human aging [ sharpless & depinho , 2002 ]    the p53 gene does not act by itself , but through a very complex network of interactions [ kohn , 1999 ] . the simplified network that is discussed in this paper ,",
    "although not being accurate in biological detail , tends to capture the essential features of the p53 network as it is known today . in particular , several different products and biological mechanisms are lumped together into a single node when their function is identical .",
    "the network is depicted in fig.1 .",
    "the arrows and signs denote the excitatory or inhibitory action of each node on the others and the letters @xmath0 denote their intensities ( or concentrations ) .    the p53 protein ( @xmath1 )",
    "is assumed to be produced at a fixed rate and to be degraded after ubiquitin labelling .",
    "the mdm2 protein being one of the main enzymes involved in ubiquitin labelling , the inhibitory node is denoted ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "there is a positive feedback loop from p53 to mdm2 , because the p53 protein , binding to the regulatory region of the mdm2 gene , stimulates the transcription of this gene into mrna .    under normal circumstances",
    "the network is `` off '' or operates at a low level .",
    "the main activation pathways are the detection of cell anomalies , like dna damage , or abnormal growth signals , such as those resulting from the expression of several oncogenes .",
    "they inhibit the degradation of the p53 protein , which may then reach a high level .",
    "there are several distinct activation pathways .",
    "for example , in some cases phosphorylation of the p53 protein blocks its interaction with mdm2 and in others it is a protein that binds to mdm2 and inhibits its action .",
    "however , the end result being a decrease in the mdm2 efficiency , they may both be described as an inhibitory input control ( @xmath3 ) to the mdm2 node .",
    "the p53 protein controls cell growth and proliferation ( @xmath4 ) , either by blocking the cell division cycle , or activating apoptosis or inhibiting the blood - vessel formation ( @xmath5 ) that is stimulated by several tumors and is essential for its growth .",
    "therefore @xmath4 and @xmath5 form a positive loop .",
    "expression of oncogenes or abnormalities is coded as an external control ( @xmath3 ) that operates both on the @xmath6 negative loop and the @xmath7 positive loop .",
    "these two ( controlled loops ) will first be studied separately and later their interaction is taken into account .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the network is modeled by a piecewise - linear discrete - time system similar to the one used in [ volchenkov & lima , 2003 ] for other gene expression networks , namely @xmath8 @xmath9 is the heaviside function , the @xmath10 s are the thresholds and in all cases @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "this condition insures that all intensities remain in interval [ @xmath13 .",
    "a similar network was studied in [ vilela mendes , 2003 ] modelled by a differential equation system .",
    "however , the piecewise - linear discrete - time model considered here allows for a more rigorous characterization of the dynamical features of the network .",
    "the study that we perform analyses the two basic network modules , namely the positive and negative loops .",
    "this type of modular analysis has been proposed before [ thieffry & romero , 1999 ] as a tool to study biological networks .",
    "however this is an adequate methodology only if , in each case , the effect of the other modules is taken into account as an external control .",
    "this changes the usual conditions for multistationarity and stable periodicity .",
    "we will follow this extended modular approach , by considering the @xmath6 loop as controlled by the @xmath3 signal and the @xmath7 loop as doubly controlled by @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath14    the thresholds @xmath15 and @xmath16 divide the unit square @xmath17^{2}$ ] into four distinct regions with different dynamical laws .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.3 ( for the case @xmath18 ) , where close to the corner of each region we have drawn the next - time map corresponding to the evolution of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . because the @xmath19 s are smaller than one , the dynamics tends to drive the system to a fixed point .",
    "however if the fixed point of the dynamics is outside that region , the dynamical law will change whenever the system moves to another region .",
    "therefore the system may never reach a fixed point and evolve forever .",
    "this is illustrated in the fig.4 , where the regions and the corresponding fixed points are color coded for the two cases ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) .",
    "notice also that , for future reference , the four regions are coded as 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "define the quantities @xmath22 notice that from ( [ 1.2 ] ) it follows @xmath23 examining fig.4 and considering all qualitatively different positions of the thresholds one obtains a complete classification of all possible dynamical behaviors of this system , which are listed in the following table :    table 1 .",
    "@xmath24    the period of the oscillations will depend on the specific values of the parameters , but the qualitative nature of the dynamics only depends on the relative positions of the thresholds and the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the coding represents the transitions between the regions defined by the thresholds . depending on the numerical values of the parameters ,",
    "the system may stay for a number of time steps in each region but then it is forced to follow the arrows in the coding scheme .    of the above four working regimens , the first two ( @xmath27 )",
    "are the biologically relevant ones , because in the absence of oncogenes ( @xmath3 ) , normal p53 is expected to be at a low level .",
    "the other two regimens correspond to biologically detrimental action of this gene , provoking premature aging .",
    "@xmath28    here we consider this system as a positive loop , with dynamical variables @xmath5 and @xmath4 and two controls @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the relevant quantities are @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 as before , the dynamics is characterized by analyzing the position of the fixed points for the 4 possible situations ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.5 , for particular values of the thresholds .",
    "the regions defined by the thresholds are , in this case , coded as a , b , c , d. we recall that the coding , listed in the tables , represents the required dynamical transitions between the regions . depending on the numerical values of the parameters ,",
    "the system may remain in each region a certain number of time steps before each transition . by adjusting the parameters we may therefore model different action delays in the network .",
    "the most important parameters controlling the delays are the dissipation parameters @xmath19 .    table  2a .",
    "( case @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) @xmath36 table  2b .",
    "( case @xmath34 and @xmath37 ) @xmath38 table 2c .",
    "( case @xmath18 and @xmath35 ) @xmath39 table 2d .",
    "( case @xmath18 and @xmath37 ) @xmath40 notice that the oscillations coded as b@xmath41c can only be realized if the dynamics jumps directly between these two regions . otherwise ,",
    "if in the course of the dynamical evolution , the system crosses the regions a or d , it will be attracted to their fixed points . in this sense",
    "this oscillation code is not as robust as the one (    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     ) in the @xmath6 system and might only be implemented for exceptional parameter values .",
    "the analysis performed in sections 2 and 3 is quite general and applies to any parameter region .",
    "however , not all parameter values will model biologically normal conditions .",
    "for example , in the absence of cell abnormalities or oncogenes ( @xmath34 ) , normal p53 will be at a low level .",
    "therefore , as follows from table 1 .",
    "@xmath42 on the other hand , on the absence of oncogenes and low p53 , that is , under non - pathological conditions , cell growth should not be explosive .",
    "therefore this condition requires for the model @xmath43 as follows from table 2a .    with the above ( normal condition ) requirements we are now ready to analyze the behavior for the other regimens .",
    "first , it follows from ( [ 4.2 ] ) that also @xmath44",
    ". therefore one sees , from table 2b that if @xmath34 and @xmath45 , then @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "that is , in the absence of oncogenes , expression of p53 completely blocks cell growth .    on the other hand , one notices , from table 2c ,",
    "that in all cases , when @xmath48 ( presence of oncogenes ) and @xmath35 , there is explosive cell growth ( @xmath49 ) . only in the special case @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "there are other solutions , but even in this case @xmath49 is a possible solution .    finally , the most interesting situation is to analyze the effect of expressed p53 ( @xmath37 ) in the presence of oncogenes ( @xmath18 ) - table 2d :    - for @xmath52 ( and any @xmath53 ) p53 effectively controls cell growth , keeping it at a low level ( @xmath54 ) . in this network model , a large value of @xmath55 is related to the effectiveness of cell growth to stimulate the required increased level of blood supply .",
    "the larger @xmath55 the less effective is the stimulation signal .    - for @xmath55 values smaller than @xmath56 the inhibitory effect of p53 may not be so effective .",
    "for example , for @xmath57 and @xmath58 there are several solutions and the outcome will depend on the initial conditions . for @xmath59 and @xmath58",
    "no control is possible .    for parameter values of @xmath16 and @xmath15 for which the @xmath6 system is driven towards a fixed point ,",
    "the behavior of the coupled system may be read directly from the @xmath7 tables of the previous section and the conclusions are as listed above . for oscillatory conditions on the @xmath6 system ,",
    "the behavior is more complex and several different regimens may be accessed . here",
    "we will illustrate , by direct numerical simulation , the behavior of the coupled system , for regions of parameter values which , as discussed above , are biologically relevant ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "figs.7 and 8 show the dynamical evolution of the variables @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 for @xmath18 and the parameter values @xmath62 and @xmath63 this corresponds to the situation @xmath64 in the @xmath6 system and @xmath65 in the @xmath7 system .",
    "the parameter values are the same for both figures .",
    "one sees that depending on the initial conditions , in one case the p53 action keeps @xmath4 at a low level and in the other it does not .",
    "figs . 9 and 10",
    "use the same parameters for the @xmath7 system , the only change being the value of @xmath16 that now is @xmath66 , that is , @xmath27 and @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the @xmath6 system oscillates instead of converging to a fixed point , but the action on the @xmath7 system is similar and it again depends on the initial conditions .",
    "1 - a simplified four - node model displays biologically reasonable features which might , at least , serve as a toy model for the p53 network .",
    "the model allows for a complete mathematical characterization of its dynamical solutions and how they depend on the parameter values ( thresholds and couplings ) . in biology , to change the threshold positions corresponds to stimulate or inhibit the mechanisms of gene expression .",
    "therefore the dynamical identification of their role on the dynamics of the network might be a guide for therapeutic action .    2 - for very large values of the @xmath55 threshold , our model p53 ( @xmath1 ) achieves control of cell growth in the presence of oncogenes .",
    "however , as illustrated before , there is a biologically reasonable region of parameters for which the successful action of @xmath1 , as an inhibitor of cell growth , strongly depends on the initial conditions . in practice",
    "it means that it is only effective if the @xmath1 level is already large enough before the positive feedback effect of @xmath4 on @xmath5 starts to play a role .",
    "it is known that in about half of human cancers p53 action is lost through mutation in the p53 gene . in many of the remaining tumors , the p53 gene is intact but it does not achieve the proper response [ woods & vousden , 2001 ] .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the loss of genetically normal p53 action .",
    "they include abnormal conformation , targeting for degradation by viral proteins , defective localization to the nucleus , amplification of mdm2 , loss of ability to inhibit mdm2 through proteins such as p14@xmath68 or loss of kinases that phosphorylate mdm2 and p53 .",
    "what our simple model suggests is that there is a range of biological parameters for which success or failure of the p53 action is very much a question of chance , that is , it depends on the initial conditions of the process .",
    "this would be a purely dynamic explanation for the failure of normal p53 .    3 - the actual biological p53 network is highly complex and contains very many nodes and pathways [ kohn , 1999 ] .",
    "our toy model has concentrated on extracting the abstract functional actions rather than reproducing the biological detail . however , there are still many other dynamical mechanisms in the organic control of dna abnormalities or pathological cell proliferation .",
    "a number of other genes either play a similar role or interact with p53 . on the other hand some of the `` defense '' mechanisms of cancer cells",
    "are directly related to the operation of the basic network .",
    "for example , oxygen starving ( hypoxia ) of tumor cells by lack of blood supply ( the @xmath5 node intensity ) activates the cxcr4 gene and this activation causes the tumor cells to migrate to other organs ( metastasis ) [ staller et al . ,",
    "inclusion of this and other qualitatively different effects seems an interesting possibility .",
    "4 - sections 2 and 3 contain a complete classification of the fixed versus periodic nature of the orbits .",
    "however , as mentioned before , the actual period of the oscillations depends strongly on the values of the parameters . in fig.11",
    "we illustrate this dependence by color coding the logarithm of the period of the orbits , in the negative loop , as a function of the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the parameters are chosen such that @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "these conditions satisfy the oscillation condition and mantain normalization .",
    "the behavior of the periods is rather discontinuous , switching from small to large values for small parameter changes .",
    "this occurs , inparticular , when some points of the orbit lie close to the thresholds .    in fig.12",
    "the rotation number @xmath74 ( the number of cycles divided by the period of the orbit , is depicted .",
    "this quantity displays a more continous behavior that the period of the orbits .",
    "highest values of @xmath74 correspond to high values of both @xmath69 and @xmath70 . however , there are still some discontinuities due mainly to orbits close to the intersection of the thresholds .",
