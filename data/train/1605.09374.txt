    "this paper was inspired by the 1965 work of padnos , as reported in reference  @xcite . using the variation ansatz with normalized wavefunctions of a particle in a box as trial wavefunctions , he obtained approximate values for the ground state energy and the first excited state energy of the one dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "padnos work was preceded by and is an improvement upon the work of rich  @xcite , who approximated the oscillator by a particle in a one dimensional box whose size was the classical range of the oscillator .",
    "one of the reasons padnos was discouraged from extending the calculations to higher energy levels was the belief that the calculation becomes more tedious as one must introduce extra terms to orthogonalize the new function to the ones already found ( for example , the second excited state must be chosen to be orthogonal to both the ground state and the first excited state ) .",
    "the authors of this present paper have no need to introduce any extra terms since the eigenstates of the particle in a box can all be chosen to be mutually orthogonal , as simple trigonometric functions ( see section  [ sec.pf1lpk4 ] ) .    another notable paper which employed the variational method for harmonic oscillator quantization is reference  @xcite , where different sets of basis functions , built from non - orthogonal monomials , were used as trial wavefunctions .",

    "the functions @xmath9 as given in  , being non - degenerate eigenstates of a hermitian operator , @xmath5 , are a complete set of vectors spanning an infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "in particular @xmath9 being mutually orthogonal in the interval and satisfying the boundary conditions are a suitable choice of trial wavefunctions for the confined harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , @xmath17 , whose eigenfunctions are also required to satisfy the same boundary conditions . the box size , @xmath18",

    "henceforth , any quantity derived for the free harmonic oscillator by optimization will be indicated with an asterik on its symbol .",

    "the optimized approximate eigenenergies of the free harmonic oscillator are then obtained from @xmath28      performing the integration in   we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
