    "this article is concerned with the least - squares method for the helmholtz equation @xcite . like other methods such as the boundary element method , the variational theory of complex rays @xcite , or the ultra - weak variational formulation @xcite",
    ", it solves the helmholtz equation by using an approximation scheme for the solutions to the equation ( plane waves , generalized harmonic polynomials , etc . ) .",
    "these methods differ by the way they match the solution to the boundary conditions and ensure the continuity between the elements . with the least - squares method ,",
    "the boundary conditions and the continuity between the subdomains are enforced via the minimization of a @xmath0-norm , allowing a simple implementation of the method .    in the particular case of the scattering of an incident wave @xmath1 by obstacles @xmath2 in the plane with dirichlet boundary conditions ,",
    "the scattered field is solution to : @xmath3 the resolution of this problem via the least - squares method was studied , among others , by stojek @xcite , and barnett and betcke @xcite .",
    "the domain of propagation was partitioned in bounded subdomains where fourier - bessel functions , or fractional fourier - bessel functions in the case of a scatterer with corners , were used for the approximation , and an unbounded domain . in this domain ,",
    "stojek used hankel functions to enforce the sommerfeld radiation condition , while barnett and betcke used the method of fundamental solutions .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the somewhat simpler case , but equally interesting , of the scattering by smooth obstacles , that , as will be shown in this article , allows the approximation of the solutions on the entire unbounded domain of propagation using a single set of functions .    in the case of a unique scatterer ,",
    "this approximation is the basis of the so - called rayleigh methods@xcite , where the scattered field is approximated by sums of multipoles @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the polar coordinates .",
    "the collocation method , or point matching method , estimates the @xmath6 coefficients by fitting the boundary conditions on @xmath6 points on the border of the scatterer . while simple to implement , this method is usually numerically unstable as the matrix to be inverted is likely to be ill - conditioned .",
    "the coefficients can also be estimated by minimizing the @xmath0 error on the boundary , where the error is approximated by numerical quadrature .",
    "this can be considered as a particular case of the least - squares methods cited above , where the approximation is done on the entire domain like in @xcite . however , in the case of scattering by an obstacle , the domain is multiply - connected and unbounded . as is usually observed in this particular case @xcite , but also in the general case @xcite ,",
    "the matrices involved in the computation have the tendency to be ill - conditioned .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the effect of the choice of the quadrature points on the numerical stability of the least - squares method in the particular case of the scattering by an obstacle .",
    "the quadrature used to estimate the error is generally either left unspecified @xcite , or uses general purpose schemes ( chebyshev nodes in @xcite or clenshaw - curtis rule in @xcite ) . however , as was shown in @xcite for the collocation method , the choice of the quadrature point is critical for the stability of the numerical methods , and depends on the shape of the scatterer .",
    "this has direct implications on the efficiency of the computational methods , as choosing the appropriate quadrature rule allows to use fewer points , making the matrices involved in the computation smaller .",
    "this work is a first step towards a more general study of the effect of the quadrature scheme on the numerical stability of least - squares methods ( i.e. with other approximations schemes such as plane waves , fourier - bessel functions , fractional fourier - bessel functions , and with several subdomains ) , but is also interesting in itself as it gives a stable numerical scheme for the scattering by an obstacle , a long standing problem in electromagnetics and acoustics@xcite .    in section 2 , we prove an approximation result for the scattering of waves by smooth obstacles : given a set of @xmath7 smooth scatterers @xmath8 , the scattered field @xmath9 , solution to , can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of sums of multipoles @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the polar coordinates with respect to a center @xmath12 , with at least one such center in each scatterer , and a finite number of coefficients @xmath13 are nonzero . in the third section of the paper",
    ", the stability of the least - squares method is investigated in the light of a recent result by cohen et al .",
    "@xcite on least - squares approximations , and numerical results are given for the scattering by an ellipse and a square , demonstrating the importance of the choice of the quadrature points .",
    "in particular , it is shown that in some cases , using a denser discretization near the singularities makes the stability harder to achieve than using a uniform density or even a denser discretization away from the singularities .",
    "finally , the application to the scattering of a plane wave by two arbitrary shaped scatterers is given .",
    "we here show that the field scattered by smooth obstacles can be uniformly approximated by sums of multipoles .",
    "this is an application of the vekua theory @xcite , a theory of elliptic pdes allowing the construction of operators mapping holomorphic functions to solutions of a given pde , as long as the coefficients of the pde are analytic .",
    "this is obviously true for the helmholtz equation , for which the operator mapping holomorphic ( or equivalently harmonic ) functions to solutions to the helmholtz equation and its inverse are explicitly known .",
    "these operators being continuous , approximation results available for holomorphic functions can be translated to similar results for solutions to the helmholtz equation .",
    "for instance , in a star - shaped domain , solutions to the helmholtz equation can be approximated by sums of fourier - bessel functions @xmath14 , that are the images of the harmonic polynomials used to approximate harmonic functions .",
    "more details on the vekua operators and on the approximation of solutions to the helmholtz equation in convex domains can be found in the articles by moiola et al .",

    "this theorem states that an analytic function on a given open domain can be , in a compact subdomain , uniformly approximated by a sequence of rational functions , with at least a pole in each connected component of the complement of its domain of analyticity .",
    "the connection between this result for analytic functions and solutions to the helmholtz equation is given by the vekua theory .",
    "the conditions of runge s theorem can actually be weakened , as shown by mergelyan s theorem@xcite .",
    "this theorem states that it is sufficient that the function to be approximated is holomorphic in the interior of @xmath16 and only continuous on the boundaries of @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , singularities can be present on the boundaries , which is likely for domains with corners .",
    "it is then reasonable to formulate this conjecture :    the uniform approximation by sum of multipoles is valid as long as the scattered field is analytic in the exterior of the obstacles , and continuous on their boundaries .",
    "this condition is in particular satisfied for domain with corners , dirichlet conditions and a continuous incident field .",
    "although this conjecture is of theoretical interest , its usefulness in numerical applications is limited .",
    "indeed , the presence of singularities on the boundary of the obstacles limits the rate of convergence of the vekua approximations @xcite .",
    "convergence can be accelerated by the use of fractional fourier - bessel functions in the approximation@xcite , but this necessitates the partition of the exterior domain in simply connected subdomains , making multipole approximations irrelevant .",
    "in the previous section , we proved that uniform approximation of the scattered field was possible for smooth scatterers , that is that the error between the scattered field @xmath9 and its best approximation @xmath19 of order @xmath21 tends uniformly to zero : @xmath83    we are here interested in least - squares method for the case of a unique scatterer .",
    "the uniform convergence implies local convergence in the @xmath0-norm ( that is , on any compact domain ) : @xmath84 in particular , it implies the convergence in the @xmath0 norm on the boundary @xmath85 of the scatterer .",
    "the following theorem , proved in @xcite , shows that the convergence on the boundary of the scatterer is sufficient to ensure convergence outside :    ( ramm , gutman ) if @xmath86 is in @xmath87 , then the solution @xmath88 of the helmholtz equation with sommerfeld radiation conditions and @xmath89 on @xmath85 is bounded on the exterior domain @xmath90 by @xmath91 where @xmath92 , with @xmath93 with @xmath94 is the sobolev space and the @xmath95 norm is weighted by @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",

    ", we aim to show that the density of points used on the border of the scatterers is critical for the stability . the tool used for the analysis",
    "can also be used to estimate , given an approximation scheme and a sampling density ( e.g. multipole approximation with uniform density on the border ) , the number of samples needed to ensure stability .",
    "with the least - squares methods , the scattered field is estimated as follows : given an order of approximation @xmath100 ( i.e. @xmath101 fourier - hankel functions ) and a number @xmath102 of points on the boundary of the scatterer , the coefficients of the multipole approximation are estimated by matching the incoming field @xmath1 and the multipole approximation on the sampling points in the least - squares sense : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the vector containing the estimated coefficients , @xmath105 the vector of the values of @xmath106 sampled on the boundary , and @xmath107 the @xmath108 matrix with terms @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the polar coordinates of the @xmath102 points on the boundary .",
    "note that the sommerfeld radiation condition does not need to be considered in the minimization problem as it is enforced through the choice of the approximation spaces .",

    "is essentially reduced to the interpolation of the incident field on the boundary of the scatterer using a finite number of functions ( the traces of the multipoles on the boundary ) from a finite number of samples .",
    "however , it is well known that even in basic cases , interpolation of a function from a finite number of samples can be unstable ( cf .",

    "these results allow the estimation of the number of measurements ensuring stability , knowing the density probability measure used to draw the points on the border , as well as the desired order of approximation .",
    "while the sampling points are not generally chosen randomly , and the values obtained are somewhat pessimistic , these results will help to evaluate the stability of sampling densities .",

    "this density ( denoted by km density in the rest of the paper ) is based on a conformal mapping between the unit disk and the scatterer .",
