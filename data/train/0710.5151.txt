    "@xmath8-duality is a perturbative symmetry of string theory and has played an important role in a wide number of applications , ranging from the study of wzw models to flux compactifications .",
    "one curious aspect of this duality is that due to mixing of the metric and the @xmath2 field under its action , it may connect backgrounds which are very different not only geometrically but also topologically .    conventional @xmath8-duality is defined for certain backgrounds with isometries in which there is an action of an @xmath9-dimensional torus on the target space @xmath3 preserving the metric and the @xmath10-form @xmath11 , which is locally given by the exterior derivative of the @xmath2-field .",
    "the equations of motion of the two - dimensional field theory then have global symmetries .",
    "the standard procedure for deriving the duality starts by gauging these isometries , i.e. by making the symmetries local by coupling to world - sheet gauge fields .",
    "then the target space of the model is enlarged to a space @xmath4 by adding fields which provide the @xmath9 extra coordinates of @xmath4 and which couple as lagrange multipliers .",
    "one can then either eliminate the extra coordinates to recover the original model with target @xmath3 , or integrate out the fibre coordinates of the torus fibration of @xmath3 to obtain the @xmath8-dual theory , and the two @xmath8-dual models define the same quantum theory . performing the calculations classically ( locally )",
