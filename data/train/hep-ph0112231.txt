    "hard reactions involving real photons , such as the photoproduction of jets  @xcite or of large@xmath0 photons  @xcite , are often presented as good tests of qcd . indeed the real photon having a pointlike coupling to a quark of the hard subprocess",
    "is a good probe of the short distance dynamics",
    ". this would particularly be the case if one could forget the hadronic component of real photons . in the initial state",
    ", the incoming real photon can fluctuate into states made of quarks and gluons which take part in the hard scattering process .",
    "this mechanism , referred to as the resolved process , leads to the introduction of quark and gluon distributions in real photons . similarly",
    "a final state large@xmath0 photon can also be produced by the fragmentation of a large@xmath0 parton emerging from the hard scattering process ; this process is described by introducing the fragmentation function of partons into real photons .",
    "therefore the reactions involving real photons are far from being simple processes and contain the whole complexity of the pure hadronic collisions .",
    "this is particularly true for the reaction @xmath7 in which the final photon is produced at large transverse momentum .",
    "each of the photons can have a direct or a resolved interaction such that eight different processes contribute to the cross section .",
    "however this complexity has a positive aspect if the various contributions to the cross section can be disentangled by means , for instance , of kinematical cuts . in an ideal situation",
    "it should be possible to separately observe direct contributions which provide unambiguous tests of qcd , resolved contributions leading to the measurement of the quark and gluon distributions in the photon and fragmentation contributions giving access to the quark and gluon fragmentation functions .",
    "these fragmentation contributions can be strongly suppressed by using isolation criteria @xcite which eliminate events with a too large hadronic transverse energy in a cone surrounding the photon .",
    "for instance the criterion used by the opal experiment @xcite , that we analyze in this paper , completely suppresses the fragmentation contribution and the remaining contributions to the cross section are due to direct and resolved incoming photons , the final photon being always a direct one .",
    "one way to disentangle the resolved contribution from the direct one rests on the measurement of the momentum of the parton entering the hard subprocess @xcite ( a measurement which requires the observation of the whole final state ) .",
    "when the ratio of this momentum to the incoming photon momentum is close to one , one expects the direct contribution to be dominant ( the photon momentum is not shared among the quarks and gluons ) ; for a ratio smaller than one the resolved contribution is the larger one .",
    "one interesting aspect of the @xmath8 reaction at lep ii energies is that the dominant contributions to the cross section contain at least one resolved photon in the initial state .",
    "the direct - direct correction is negligible , and the observation of the @xmath8 cross section opens the possibility to measure the parton distributions in the photon",
    ".    another interesting point of the reaction @xmath9 at lep ii energies is the small contribution of the nlo corrections .",
    "as we shall see below , these corrections represent  for the scales set equal to @xmath10  about 10 % of the cross section .",
    "this result shows that the qcd corrections are well under control .",
    "moreover the scale dependence is very weak and therefore the theoretical predictions are unambiguous .",
    "the possibility to constrain the parton distributions in the photon , especially the rather poorly known gluon distribution , via the process @xmath11 has already been pointed out in  @xcite . while @xcite is a leading order calculation , in @xcite the calculation",
    "is done at next - to - leading order , but only the fully inclusive cross section is calculated , without the possibility to consider isolated photons or a photon + jet final state .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the theoretical framework and to the discussion of predictions for the inclusive cross sections @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in section 3",
    "we study the reaction @xmath14 , emphasizing the difference to the inclusive case .",
    "comparisons with preliminary results of the opal experiment are performed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 contains the conclusion .",
    "as the general framework of the calculation has already been described in detail in @xcite , we will give only a brief overview on the method here .    in @xmath1 reactions ,",
    "the electrons can act like a source of quasi - real photons whose spectrum can be described by the weizscker - williams formula    [ 1e ] f_^e(y ) = _ em 2 \\ { 1 + ( 1 - y)^2 y  q^2_max ( 1- y ) m_e^2  y^2  - } .",
    "this approximation is valid as long as @xmath15 where @xmath0 is a large scale characterizing the hard subprocess , for instance the transverse momentum of the final photon . in this section",
    "we use this approximation , postponing to section  4 a discussion of its validity when comparing our predictions with opal data .",
    "the quasi - real photon then either takes part _ directly _ in the hard scattering process , or it acts as a composite object , being a source of partons which take part in the hard subprocess . the latter mechanism is referred to as _ resolved _ process and is parametrized by the photon structure functions @xmath16 .",
    "thus the distribution of partons in the electron is given by the convolution    [ 2e ] f_a",
    "/ e(x_e , m ) = _ 0 ^ 1 dy  dx _ f_^e ( y )  f_a/ ( x _ , m ) ( x _ y - x_e )    where in the `` direct '' case @xmath17 .    similarly , a high-@xmath0 photon in the final state can either originate directly from the hard scattering process or it can be produced by the fragmentation of a hard parton emerging from the hard scattering process . however , as discussed in the introduction , this fragmentation contribution can strongly be suppressed by using an isolation criterion .",
    "it turns out that this isolation is also useful at the experimental level in order to single out the prompt photon events from the background of secondary photons produced by the decays of light mesons .",
    "the isolation criterion used by the opal collaboration is the one proposed by frixione @xcite which leads to a complete suppression of the fragmentation contributions ( contributions involving the fragmentation function @xmath18 of parton @xmath19 into a photon ) . at the parton level we have the following constraints  : for each parton @xmath20 , the distance    [ 3e ] r_i =    to the photon is computed in @xmath21 space , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity , respectively .",
    "a photon is kept if the condition    [ 4e ] _",
    "i e_t , i ( - r_i , ) 0.2 e_t , 1 - ( ) 1 - ( r ) ,    is fulfilled , where @xmath24 is the transverse energy of the @xmath25 parton , @xmath26 is the step function , which ensures that only particles in the cone with aperture @xmath27 contribute to the sum , and the cone radius is @xmath28 .    as a result , we only have to consider contributions with a direct final photon",

    "for instance the direct - direct contribution varies from 7.85@xmath56pb to @xmath57pb whereas the total cross section is equal to 23.82@xmath56pb at @xmath52 .",
    "if we vary the factorization scale @xmath38 only , keeping @xmath39 fixed to @xmath10 , the variations of the nlo cross section are of course larger since cancellations of @xmath58 and @xmath59 terms are spoiled , but they are still only of the order of 20% for a variation of @xmath60 by almost two orders of magnitude , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    to conclude this short study of the cross section",
    "@xmath47 we can say that the nlo calculation is well under control ; the ho corrections are small and the sensitivity of the cross section to the scales is negligible .",
    "therefore the reaction @xmath61 offers interesting tests of qcd and should allow to put constraints on the parton distributions in the real photon .",
    "the cross section @xmath62 is a good observable to determine @xmath63 , because the value of @xmath64 is closely related to the value of @xmath65 . as a consequence",

    "the cross sections @xmath66 are shown in fig .",

    "obviously the result is symmetric with respect to @xmath68 within the statistical errors .",

    "however , in view of other uncertainties of the order of 5% ( see section 4 ) , it has not been included in the results shown .",
    "the box correction @xmath70 to the double resolved part is one order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath69 box and therefore completely negligible .",
    "large values of @xmath65 enhance the direct - resolved contribution ( where the incoming direct photon goes towards positive rapidity ) .",
    "the resolved - resolved contribution is quite flat and the direct - direct one almost negligible ( at the scales @xmath71 ) .",
    "a value of @xmath72 larger than 3  gev would enhance the single resolved cross section with respect to the double resolved one .",
    "in the introduction , we discussed the possibility to enhance a resolved contribution with respect to a direct one by fixing the momentum of the partons entering the hard subprocess . following the opal collaboration ,",
    "we define    [ 5e ] x^ = ( e_jet p_z^jet ) + ( e _ p_z^ ) _ had , ( e p_z ) = p_t^jet  e^_jet + p_t^  e^ _",
    "y^     where @xmath73 are the fractional momenta of the quasi - real initial photons oriented towards the positive and negative @xmath74-axis , @xmath75 .",
    "the conventions are such that particle one travels towards the positive @xmath74-direction , such that e.g. direct - resolved means that the direct photon  with momentum fraction @xmath76  moves to positive @xmath74 whereas the resolved photon ( with momentum fraction @xmath77 ) moves to negative @xmath74 . the variables @xmath78 defined by eq .",
    "( [ 5e ] ) are exactly the longitudinal momentum fractions ( with respect to the photon momenta ) of the partons entering the hard subprocess if the latter is a @xmath29 process . in the case of a @xmath79 subprocess ,",
    "these momentum fractions are no more fixed by the observation of the photon and a jet since there are configurations with a third ( unobserved ) particle in the final state such that the true value of @xmath80 in @xmath81 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) ) can be larger than @xmath78 .",
    "nevertheless @xmath78 remain useful variables to constrain the parton momenta .",
    "the definition ( [ 5e ] ) implies to measure the jet rapidity and transverse energy . in ref .",
    "@xcite we defined another variable which does not require the measurement of @xmath82 , [ 6e ] x_ll^ = p_t^ ( e^_jet + e^ _ ) y^   .",
    "this is certainly an advantage with respect to expression ( [ 5e ] ) , because the measurement of a jet transverse energy at small @xmath82 ( @xmath83  gev ) can be very difficult and inaccurate ; it is delicate to disentangle the jet energy from the underlying event energy .",
    "moreover the variables ( [ 6e ] ) lead to smoother theoretical distributions in the regions @xmath84 , which may be useful if one wants to compare theory with data for these values of @xmath85 .",
    "these points have been discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite to which we refer the interested reader .    before using these variables ,",
    "let us consider the behaviour of the photon - jet cross section with respect to the photon and jet rapidities .",
    "in order to enhance the direct - resolved contribution , we choose a large value of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and we vary @xmath65 .",
    "the jets are defined in agreement with the cone algorithm used by the opal collaboration @xcite , with a cone radius @xmath28 and a cut on the minimum value of @xmath88 that we fix equal to 3  gev  @xcite .",
    "we also fix @xmath89  gev .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and they can be compared to those displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "we recall that , as always , the individual contributions to the total cross section have no physical meaning .",
    "their relative importances are scale dependent . however , choosing e.g. the scales @xmath90 does not modify the fact that the direct - resolved contribution dominates in the range @xmath91 . fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the enhanced direct - resolved contribution , corresponding to small values of @xmath92 and large values of @xmath93 in expressions ( [ 5e ] ) or ( [ 6e ] ) , for the two scale choices @xmath94 and @xmath90 .",
    "hence , by working at large photon and jet rapidities , we can enhance the direct - resolved contribution and study its behaviour as a function of @xmath92 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we display the distribution @xmath95 obtained with @xmath96gev , @xmath87 and @xmath97 .",
    "the contributions from direct - direct and resolved - direct have been summed up in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] since at @xmath98 there are large cancellations between these two contributions due to the finite remainders of the initial state collinear singularities , as has been explained in section  [ sec21 ] .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig7a](a ) .",
    "of course there are also cancellations between the direct - resolved and the direct - direct part , but those are of major importance in the @xmath99 spectrum for @xmath100 , affecting the @xmath101 distribution only marginally",
    ".    thus we can conclude from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that in the domain @xmath102 the cross section @xmath103 is quite sensitive to the parton distributions @xmath104 in the photon .",
    "until now we have used the variable @xmath105 to study the various contributions to the cross section @xmath106 . the use of @xmath78 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ 5e ] ) leads to a similar result , except around @xmath107 where the cross section @xmath108 has a smoother behaviour , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig7a](b ) .",
    "[ fig6b ] shows that the contribution from the subprocess @xmath109 contributing to the direct - resolved part of @xmath13 is very small , and even negative for @xmath110 , such that the full direct - resolved contribution is slightly _ lower _ than the one where @xmath111 has been set to zero .",
    "thus the sensitivity to the gluon distribution in the photon as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6b](a ) is basically due to the double resolved part in the present study .",
    "before comparing theoretical predictions and data we have to assess the validity of the weizscker - williams ( ww ) approximation embedded in formula ( [ 1e ] ) .",
    "this approximation is obviously correct as long as the photon virtuality is negligible with respect to the scale involved in the hard subprocess , namely @xmath10 .",
    "but in opal @xmath112  gev@xmath35 is of the order of the subprocess scale , @xmath67  gev , and higher twist contributions proportional to @xmath113 are not a priori negligible .",
    "however we have to note that the weizscker - williams formula is dominated by the term @xmath114 which is very large ( @xmath115 ) because of the small mass of the electron ; therefore the ww approximation should not be too bad , even if @xmath116 .",
    "moreover the large virtuality of the incoming photon questions the use of parton distributions in real photons . to estimate the importance of the corrections due to the photon virtuality ,",
