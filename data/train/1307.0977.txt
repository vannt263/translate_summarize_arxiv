    "in the late 1970 s , w. krieger @xcite introduced a pair of invariants for a shift of finite type , called the past and future dimension groups . building on these two ideas , the third author @xcite has shown the existence of a homology theory for smale spaces whose existence had been conjectured earlier by bowen @xcite and which generalizes krieger s invariant .    the main goal of this paper is to compute the homology of one - dimensional generalized solenoids defined by williams @xcite , generalized by inhyeop yi @xcite and later by klaus thomsen @xcite .",
    "in fact these spaces are inverse limits of finite graphs with one expanding map @xmath3 .",

    "since the solenoids have totally disconnected stable sets , the factor map can be chosen to have the property that it is @xmath4-bijective ( see section 1 ) . in this case",
