    "the detection of co j=32 emission in the iras f10214 + 4724 galaxy at z@xmath112.3 ( brown & vanden bout 1991 ; solomon , downes & radford 1992 ) was the first detection of a molecular gas mass tracer at high redshifts , initiating a series of largely fruitful efforts to detect co lines in qsos ( e.g. barvainis et al .",
    "1994 ; omont et al . 1996 ; ohta et al .",
    "1996 ) , sub - mm bright galaxies ( e.g. frayer et al . 1998 ; neri et al .",
    "2003 ) , and ly - break galaxies ( baker et al .",
    "2004 ) at increasingly high redshifts .",
    "the current record stands at z@xmath126.42 ( walter et al .",
    "2003 ) , dramatically expanding the domain over which such standard ism probes can be used to deduce h@xmath1 mass , its average physical conditions , and ( when sufficient angular resolution is available ) to provide information about total versus h@xmath1 gas mass . on occasion such observations reveal that , unlike local ulirgs , high - z starbursts can have star formation activity extending over tens of kiloparsecs , fueled by large reservoirs of molecular gas whose mass dominates the total dynamic mass ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the importance of detecting the two ci lines at any redshift stems from extensive evidence for fully concomitant @xmath13co , @xmath14co and ci emission in galactic molecular clouds ( keene 1997 and references therein ; ikeda et al .",
    "thus ci can be an alternative , optically thin , molecular gas tracer , which remains sensitive also for gas with low excitation conditions ( papadopoulos , thi , & viti 2004 ) .",
    "previous work reported the presence of co j=32 and ci j=10 , 21 emission in the strongly lensed iras f10214 + 4724 possibly extending in regions around it and beyond the amplification power of the gravitational lens ( brown & vanden bout 1991 , 1992a , b ) .",
    "this raised the possibility of a massive amount of molecular gas reservoir present near this high - z galaxy , but follow - up co j=32 observations assigned all the observed co emission to the strongly lensed object ( downes , solomon & radford 1995 ) and this issue was considered resolved ( see radford et al .",
    "1996 for a summary ) .",
    "observations of the ci j=10 line in iras f10214 + 4724 and a few other high - z objects have been recently reported in the literature where the emission from the former is found to be @xmath15 times weaker than originally reported ( weiss et al .",
    "2004 ) . here",
    "it must be emphasized that _ ci observations at any redshift are important on their own right and are not a trivial variation of co observations since ci line emission remains luminous also for low - excitation gas that may be underluminous in the co @xmath16 lines _",
    "( see e.g. kaufman et al .",
    "this provided the main motivation for the follow - up observations to search for ci j=21 emission in and around this high - z ulirg that are presented in this paper .",
    "a hubble constant of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are assumed throughout .",
    "the 15-meter james clerk maxwel telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii , was utilized to observe the ci j=21 line ( @xmath19 ghz ) towards iras f10214 + 4724 ( @xmath20 from co lines ; et al .",
    "1995 ) in numerous observing sessions , namely in january 17th , 20 - 22nd , 2003 , and during several sessions between 15th and 28th of june , and on july 7th 2004 . during",
    "the 2003 observing period the dsb receiver a3 yielded typical effective system temperatures of @xmath21  k and somewhat higher ones , @xmath22 , during the 2004 period . in",
    "the former period a3 was tunned at @xmath23  ghz and the digital autocorrelation spectrometer ( das ) was set at its widest bandwidth of 1.84 ghz ( @xmath24 ) , while in the latter a bandwidth of 920  mhz ( @xmath25 ) , centered at @xmath26 ghz ( the exact line center as expected from the co lines ) , was used .",
    "the wide bandwidth mode of the das was initially used to allow for a ci line wider than expected from the high - j co transitions ( since more gas may be excited in ci ) while maintaining ample baseline to define the zero level .",
    "the telescope pointing and focus were checked regularly using saturn and the spectral - line standard irc+10216 ( for spectral - line pointing ) and the estimated rms pointing error was @xmath27 ( @xmath111/7 of the @xmath28 beam at this frequency ) .",
    "frequent observations of irc+10216 at co j=21 verified the proper receiver tunning and yielded a spectral line calibration uncertainty of @xmath29 .",
    "rapid beam switching at @xmath30 hz and an azimuthal throw of @xmath31 were employed . finally , in order to search for the purported extended ci emission along the north - south direction ( brown & vanden bout 1992b ) , the points @xmath32 were also observed during the 2003 observing period .",
    "the final co - added spectra are shown in figures 1 and 2 respectively .    the quantity @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the spectral line profile , has a thermal rms error of    @xmath35^{1/2 }   \\delta t^ * _ { a , ch } \\delta v_{chan},\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the number of channels @xmath37 comprising @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the total number of channels used to define the line - free offset @xmath40 ( @xmath41 channels placed on each side of the line ) .",
    "the rms error per channel @xmath42 is assumed uniform over the band .    from the spectra shown in figures 1 and 2 it",
    "is estimated @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for the average spectrum of the two @xmath45 offset positions .",
    "the fwzi of the ci line was assumed to be @xmath46 ( from multiple , high s / n , co line observations , radford et al .",
    "upper limits can be alternatively expressed in terms of velocity - integrated flux densities from    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the aperture efficiency of jcmt at this frequency ( a point source was assumed with a source size : @xmath49 , downes et al .",
    "the 2@xmath50 upper limits obtained from the present observations are : @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( where a @xmath53 line calibration uncertainty was also added in quadrature along with the thermal rms error ) .",
    "the galaxy f10214 + 4724 has had several of its co lines and thermal dust continuum frequencies detected ( solomon downes , & radford 1992 ; downes , solomon , & radford 1995 and references therein ) , from which @xmath54 k , and @xmath55 are deduced .",
    "recently weiss et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have measured the flux of the j=10 line towards the central position using the iram 30-m telescope and found it to be @xmath56 . in principle measurements of both ci j=21 and j=10 lines can yield constraints on the gas excitation properties independent of those deduced from the co lines . indeed , assuming a collisional excitation of the ci 3-level system ( and that the lines are optically thin ) it is    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the einstein coefficients of the two transitions , and",
    "@xmath60 express the relative population levels ( their full expressions can be found in papadopoulos et al .",
    "the upper limit on the ci j=21 line emission reported here and the measurement by weiss at al . for j=10 yield @xmath61 , which is fully compatible with the values expected for the conditions reported for the molecular gas in this galaxy ( downes et al .",
    "1995 ) but hardly constraining by itself .",
    "however somewhat more sensitive ci j=21 measurements would yield non - trivial constraints , e.g. for @xmath62 ( corresponding to @xmath63 limit of the current measurements ) one finds @xmath64 ( for lte ) to @xmath65 ( for @xmath66 ) , which now probes the temperature range deduced from co and dust measurements .    assuming that co , dust and ci emission are fully concomitant and tracing the same h@xmath1 gas reservoir allows @xmath67 to be expressed in terms of h@xmath1 mass by using    @xmath68^{-1 } \\rm \\left[\\frac{a_{21}}{10^{-7 } s^{-1}}\\right]^{-1 } q_{21 } ^{-1 }",
    "\\left [ \\frac{s_{ci}(2 - 1)}{jy\\ km\\ s^{-1}}\\right],\\ ] ]    ( see e.g. papadopoulos et al .",
    "2004 ) where @xmath69 ( for @xmath70 and @xmath71 ; downes et al .",
    "an abundance of @xmath72/[h_2]\\sim   3\\times 10^{-5}$ ] is adopted , identical to the one used by weiss et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in their h@xmath1 gas mass estimate in the cloverleaf qso .",
    "however an uncertainty of a factor of two in @xmath73 is to be expected over the range of ism conditions ( higher values more likely for star forming environments ) .    for a lensing factor @xmath74 ( downes et al .",
    "1995 ) the reported upper limit on @xmath75 translates to a molecular gas mass upper limit of @xmath76 .",
    "the latter is compatible with the co - deduced molecular gas mass of @xmath77 ( downes et al .",
    "1995 ) , within the expected uncertainties of both methods .",
    "it must be mentioned that the ci j=21 emission , with its less demanding excitation requirements , can be more spatially extended than that of the co j+1@xmath2j , @xmath78 lines ( see e.g. kaufman et al .",
    "1999 , their figures 10 and 13 ) and then any differential lensing would act to raise the value of the reported @xmath79 upper limit ( less amplification of the more extended emission ) .",
    "the deduced upper limits are much lower than the @xmath67 values reported by brown & vanden bout ( 1992b ) which used the nrao 12-m telescope , with a beam of @xmath80 ( hpbw ) , to find @xmath81 jy km s@xmath82 .",
    "there is no indication of such strong emission in the data presented here , which would have been detected at a s / n@xmath83 .",
    "the possibility that most of such emission is distributed in the area between the @xmath84 and @xmath85 beam areas of the jcmt and the 12-m telescope is remote . indeed",
    "the average spectrum of the two offset positions @xmath86 ( fig .",
    "2 ) where the purported extended ci emission was claimed to be the strongest , do not confirm its presence at the levels previously reported .",
    "the latter disagreement can be wholy attributed to the poor quality and low s / n ratio of the associated spectra taken with the iram 30-m telescope .",
    "however in their 12-m data a line towards the @xmath87 position appears detected at a sufficient s / n ratio .",
    "for this set of their measurements baseline / spectrometer instabilities are a more likely cause for the discrepancy k ) , using two different receiver tunnings in order to cover the line , and with a chop throw that is four times larger than the one employed here .",
    "all these are expected to make their measurements especially prone to weather / instrumentally - induced baseline instabilities . ] . in the present dataset an intermittent baseline instability affected the data taken over a long observing session during the 2003 period and appears as a spectral line detected at a s / n=4 - 5 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this `` line '' appears strongly only in a handful of the spectra making up the co - added spectrum , and its low - level intermittent nature along with the otherwise normal thermal noise superimposed on it made the affected spectra difficult to identify in the data reduction processes .",
    "this was made possible only after coarse averaging and inspection of all individual spectra and the acquisition of more data spread over several observing sessions and with different spectrometer setups .",
    "the results of this work can be summarized as follows :      \\2 . under the assumption that ci emission traces the bulk of the h@xmath1 gas mass located in the strongly - lensed object",
    "an upper limit of @xmath89 is deduced .",
    "this is compatible with the co - derived h@xmath1 mass , within the uncertainties of the two methods .",
    "however any differential lensing effects between the easier - to - excite and possibly more extended ci emission ( with respect to co j=32 ) would act to raise the ci - derived h@xmath1 mass limit .",
    "\\3 . a comparison with the recently reported ci j=10 line intensity in this object by weiss et al .",
    "( 2004 ) allows an upper limit on the ci ( 21)/(10 ) line ratio to be placed .",
    "its value , while compatible with the average co - derived excitation conditions of the molecular gas , does not offer any useful independent constraints by itself .",
    "nevertheless only a modest improvement of any future ci j=21 measurements ( a factor of 2 ) is needed in order to yield a good such independent constraint .",
    "the discrepancy between the hereby presented measurements with those of brown & vanden bout is attributed to the low s / n and baseline instabilities affecting their data .",
    "the latter source of error can be particularly insidious as demonstrated by an affected part of dataset presented here where such an instability could easily be construed as a line detected at @xmath90 .",
    "i thank the jcmt operator jim hoge whose determination made this work possible , often under difficult conditions .",
    "axel weiss is gratefuly acknowledged for his mistrust of the spectral `` line '' appearing on the first dataset .",
    "this has been proven crucial in re - reducing the original dataset much more carefuly as well as acquiring more data , both of which led to the revision of the original claim of ci j=21 detection in f10214 + 4724 and the hereby reported upper limits .",
