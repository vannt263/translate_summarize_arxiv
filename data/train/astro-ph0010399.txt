    "ngc 6334 is a prominent @xmath1  region / molecular cloud complex located in the sagittarius arm of the milky way at a photometric distance of 1.7 kpc @xcite ( @xmath2 arcmin ) .",
    "the complex contains several recent and current star - forming sites which are embedded in an elongated giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) extending over about 45 arcmin ( , ) .    far - infrared observations at wavelengths 80250 microns by revealed six strong continuum concentrations , the peaks of which are designated fir - i to fir - vi .",
    "sources i to v are present along a ridge of extended continuum emission which runs northeast  southwest , parallel to the plane of our galaxy , while the weak , extended source vi is situated further south .",
    "observations at 4.9 ghz by yielded six continuum concentrations also located along the ridge .",
    "designated a to f , some are coincident with the far - infrared concentrations .",
    "the continuum ridge is coincident with a dark dust lane seen at optical wavelengths ( e.g ) .",
    "the dust lane appears to be obscuring the optical ionized distribution , suggesting that it is overlying the nebulosity .",
    "the radio continuum concentrations have been individually observed in several projects ( see discussion in section 3.1 ) .",
    "the results show that most of them have associated outflows , sites of maser emission , or embedded protostars , all indicative of very active sites of star formation .    to further investigate the physical conditions of the ngc 6334 complex , we have carried out a series of observations of the 1612- , 1665- , 1667- , and 1720-mhz hyperfine transitions of the @xmath0 , j=3/2 ground state of oh using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "these four transitions are valuable in investigations of molecular clouds because they can exhibit extended emission and absorption and maser emission .",
    "a direct result of the statistical weights and transition probabilities of the ` main lines ' ( at 1665 and 1667 mhz ) and ` satellite lines ' ( at 1612 and 1720 mhz ) is that , under conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , their optical depths , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , are in the ratio 1:5:9:1 .",
    "previous studies of oh have shown that both the main - line and satellite - line intensities often show non - lte ratios .",
    "the satellite lines can also exhibit a conjugate - type behaviour whereby emission of one line is accompanied by absorption of the other . this behaviour is explained in detail by and references therein .",
    "the satellite - line behaviour can be used as a diagnostic for the type of oh excitation process taking place in the region and may also provide density constraints .",
    "for example , radiative excitation at high densities can produce 1612-mhz emission but collisional excitation at low temperatures can lead to 1720-mhz emission @xcite .",
    "the ratios of the optical depths of the four transitions give @xmath7 this relationship is commonly termed the ` sum rule ' ( e.g. ) and can be used to obtain optical depth measurements even in cases where lte is not satisfied . for low optical depths and an extended continuum emission with a flat spectrum",
    "the sum rule becomes @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the line temperature of the transition .",
    "the atca observations were carried out with six different array configurations between 1994 september and 1995 august .",
    "details of the instrument are given by .",
    "the antenna spacings ranged from 30 m to 6 km .",
    "all sets of observations were made with the correlator configured to 2048 frequency channels over a bandwidth of 4 mhz , providing a velocity resolution of 0.42 kms@xmath10 .",
    "two orthogonal linear polarisations were observed and then later averaged together .",
    "the observations were made using standard procedures , cycling through frequencies centred on 1666 , 1720 and 1612 mhz .",
    "the 1665- and 1667-mhz lines were both included in the band centred at 1666 mhz .",
    "observations of pks 1740 - 517 were used for phase and bandpass calibration .",
    "flux - density calibration was provided by observing pks 1934 - 638 ( adopted as the atca primary calibrator ) , for which flux densities of 14.3 , 14.2 , 14.0 jy were adopted at 1612 , 1666 and 1720 mhz respectively .    at 1.6 ghz ,",
    "the half - power primary beamsize of the atca is 30 arcmin . for observations centred on ra(b1950 )",
    "= 17@xmath1117@xmath1210@xmath13 , dec(b1950 ) = @xmath1449@xmath1500@xmath16 , the half - power primary beam covered all the major continuum concentrations along the ridge of ngc 6334 .",
    "the correlated spectral outputs from pairs of atca antennae were processed using a package based on the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) produced by the us national radio astronomy observatory .",
    "the continuum emission was subtracted from each spectral - line dataset and then combined into a single continuum dataset . for all four spectral - line datasets , the frequency scale was converted to a velocity scale with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "amplitude and phase self - calibration were applied to the 1665- , 1667- and 1720-mhz datasets , all of which contained strong maser emission .",
    "strong residuals remained in the main - line channel maps ( @xmath17 mjy beam@xmath10 for the images near the central velocities of the masers ) because the intensities of the two masers both varied on time scales of a few months , producing different values measured for each array - configuration .",
    "image analysis was carried out using miriad @xcite and karma @xcite .",
    "uniform and natural weighting were used for both the continuum data and each channel of the line data .",
    "multi - frequency synthesis @xcite was also adopted for the continuum data .",
    "each image was deconvolved using the clean algorithm of and restored with diffraction - limited beams of @xmath18 arcsec@xmath19 ( uniform weighting ) and @xmath20 arcsec@xmath19 ( natural weighting ) .",
    "each image was also corrected for the primary beam gain pattern of the individual antennas .",
    "the uniform - weighted line images , with a velocity resolution of 0.42 kms@xmath10 , were used to investigate maser emission and the natural - weighted line images , hanning smoothed to a velocity resolution of 0.7 kms@xmath10 , were used to investigate the extended oh emission .",
    "1 shows the natural - weighted 1.6-ghz continuum image with an rms noise level of 0.009 jy beam@xmath10 .",
    "the main emission concentrations are labelled using the nomenclature of and and their positions and fluxes are described in table 1 .",
    "the position of the far - infrared source ngc 6334-i(n ) is marked with a cross ( see section 3.1.6 ) .",
    "the overall structure of ngc 6334-a to -f is similar to that derived by ( , ) at 4.9 ghz , and at 8.3 ghz .",
    "continuum emission at 1.6-ghz was also detected towards ngc 6334-v and as a weak source south of ngc 6334-d ( ngc 6334-d(s ) ) .",
    "all of the concentrations are superimposed on faint emission which extends northwest from the dark dust lane .",
    "this faint emission , and also the two faint semi - circular emission regions near the southern boundary of fig .",
    "1 , follow the optical and infrared distributions .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for ngc 6334-d and -e , eq .",
    "2 is approximately satisfied suggesting that the oh optical depths towards these regions are low .",
    "therefore the 1665- and 1667-mhz line - to - continuum values of these two regions are valid approximations of the actual optical depths at each transition . for ngc 6334-a",
    "the sum of the line - to - continuum ratios for the satellite lines ( @xmath21 ) is higher than the weighted sum for the main lines ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is consistent with higher optical depths and therefore the line - to - continuum measurements as approximations of optical depth should be used conservatively .    in all measurable cases ,",
    "the main - line profiles also show non - lte line ratios .",
    "the @xmath23/@xmath24 ratios range from 1.0 to 1.2 .",
    "these values differ significantly from the lte value of 1.8 . since the we know from the results of eq .",
    "2 that the optical depths are low towards ngc 6334-d and -e , the non - lte ratios for these two regions can only be explained in terms of high optical depth if the cloud is clumping on smaller scales .",
    "figs 10 to 12 show the velocity maps of the 1612-mhz emission and absorption for ngc 6334-v , -a , and -d .",
    "the velocity increment of each image is 0.7 kms@xmath10 . only the 1612-mhz transition is shown because the corresponding 1720-mhz transition has a similar distribution and",
    "does not demonstrate the flip from emission to absorption as clearly as the 1612-mhz transition . in all cases there",
    "is significant 1612-mhz emission which presumably results from radiative excitation of dense oh ( h@xmath25 column densities @xmath26 @xmath27 ) by nearby infrared objects .    _",
    "ngc 6334-v : _ the set of velocity maps ( fig .",
    "10 ) show 1612-mhz emission present over a velocity range of @xmath28 kms@xmath10  to @xmath29 kms@xmath10 .",
    "the distribution does not mirror the continuum emission shown in fig . 2 , but consists of a concentration which extends over 2.5 arcmin in the north  south direction and 2 arcmin east  west , covering the region of enhanced infrared emission as might be expected .",
    "the distribution coincides with a region of co(21 ) emission @xcite .",
    "the possible sites of triggered star formation detected by trace an arc around the eastern edge of the 1612-mhz emission .",
    "the change of this emission with velocity suggests an expanding filled - shell structure . at some velocities a relatively sharp decrease in intensity",
    "is present at the south - western edge of the peak emission .",
    "the 1720-mhz oh transition is in absorption over the same velocity range as the 1612-mhz transition , and has the same distribution . to the west of the main 1612-mhz emission",
    "is an area of faint absorption .",
    "it is associated with faint 1720-mhz emission , and here , away from the infrared emission , collisional excitation may be responsible .",
    "although the extended main - line oh absorption is masked by two bright masers ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , a comparison of peak line - to - continuum ratios at 1612 mhz and 1720 mhz , listed in table 3 , indicates anomalous behaviour .",
    "the average of the two values ( @xmath30 ) is positive , whereas for a simple oh - absorption environment the sum rule decrees that the value must be negative .",
    "one explanation might be that radiative excitation of a dense oh cloud by the embedded infrared objects has resulted in low - gain maser amplification at 1612-mhz .    _",
    "ngc 6334-a : _ the profiles in fig . 9 show , 1612-mhz absorption between @xmath31 and @xmath32 kms@xmath10  and then 1612-mhz emission to @xmath33 kms@xmath10 . at 1720",
    "mhz , emission between @xmath34 and @xmath35 kms@xmath10  is followed by deep absorption extending to @xmath33 kms@xmath10 .",
    "the weighted - sum profile has a shape similar to the main - line profiles , as predicted by the sum rule .",
    "conjugate satellite - line behaviour is obviously present and the extent is given by the deviations of the individual spectra from the weighted - sum profile .",
    "accordingly , for the 1612-mhz transition , the deviations would show a profile similar in shape to the 1612-mhz emission profile , but the absorption intensity would be reduced and emission intensity increased ( to about 0.2 jy beam@xmath10 ) . for the 1720-mhz transition the difference spectrum would show exact conjugate behaviour .",
    "the set of velocity maps ( fig .",
    "11 ) show that the overall distribution of the 1612-mhz absorption and emission is spherical , with an average diameter of about 1 arcmin , and coincides with the central region of bright continuum emission in fig .",
    "the extent is similar to that for the nh@xmath36 emission @xcite . at a velocity of @xmath37 kms@xmath10",
    "the distribution splits into absorption and emission components , diametrically offset . at the extreme velocities , the relative offset virtually disappears , ruling out rotation .",
    "the 1720-mhz transition exhibits conjugate behaviour with the same distribution as the 1612-mhz transition , including the splitting at @xmath37 kms@xmath10 .",
    "the results are consistent with satellite - line anomalies resulting from oh excitation by the infrared objects embedded in the cloud and a density gradient that increases with the more positive observed velocities of the molecular gas .",
    "this density gradient may also explain the distribution at a velocity of @xmath37 kms@xmath10  and is discussed further in section 4.2 .    _",
    "ngc 6334-d : _ for the 1612-mhz transition , the profiles in fig . 9",
    "show absorption from @xmath34 kms@xmath10  to @xmath35 kms@xmath10  then emission extending to 0 kms@xmath10 .",
    "the 1720-mhz transition is totally in absorption .",
    "comparison of these profiles with the weighted - sum profile suggests that anomalous satellite - line behaviour is present only at velocities more positive than @xmath38 kms@xmath10 . here , the enhanced 1612-mhz emission is accompanied by enhanced 1720-mhz absorption .",
    "the set of velocity maps ( fig .",
    "12 ) reveal that the distribution of the 1612-mhz absorption and emission is not completely coincident with the region of brightest continuum emission . instead of an approximately spherical distribution centred near irs-24",
    ", 1612-mhz emission is concentrated along an arc to the west of the object .",
    "the 1720-mhz absorption was found to have a similar distribution .",
    "the offset locations are consistent with the extended oh cloud distribution traced by the 1667-mhz absorption in fig .",
    "there are no velocity trends to confirm the presence of a possible outflow in the region .",
    "the anomalous satellite - line behaviour is presumably due to the oh excitation by one or more of the infrared sources",
    ". it may be significant that for both this and the previous case , the @xmath1  velocities fall within the velocity range of the 1612-mhz emission .",
    "_ ngc 6334-e : _ anomalous satellite behaviour dominates the 1612-mhz and the 1720-mhz profiles shown in fig .",
    "the 1612-mhz absorption from @xmath39 kms@xmath10  to @xmath37 kms@xmath10 followed by emission to @xmath33 kms@xmath10 is matched by a conjugate variation at 1720 mhz .",
    "this is a typical example of the anomaly flip discussed in section 3.3.1 , and the results can be interpreted in terms of low - density gas for the more negative observed velocities and high - density for the more positive observed velocities .",
    "the distribution of the absorption and emission at 1612 and 1720 mhz follows the 1.6-ghz continuum emission ( see fig .",
    "6 ) and is consistent with an overlying oh cloud .",
    "_ ngc 6334-f : _ information about the extended oh is very restricted because the main - line and 1720-mhz observations are dominated by bright maser emission ( see fig .",
    "the 1612-mhz transition is also in emission centred near the continuum emission peak , at ra(b1950 ) = 17@xmath1117@xmath123242 @xmath40 , dec(b1950 ) = @xmath1444@xmath15054 @xmath41 .",
    "the narrow velocity width of 1.8 kms@xmath10  and the unresolved angular size would be consistent with maser emission .",
    "however the peak intensity of 0.19 jy beam@xmath10 is at least two orders of magnitude lower than the intensities of the other masers .",
    "in addition , the position differs by 1.8 arcsec from the position of the other masers and the velocity of the peak ( @xmath42 kms@xmath10 ) is more positive than the velocities of the 1720-mhz and main - line masers ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 kms@xmath10respectively ) .",
    "interpretation of the results is difficult without additional information .",
    "the presence of several infrared objects and masers ( see fig .",
    "6 ) suggest a region of considerable star - forming activity .",
    "excitation of a high - density",
    "oh cloud by infrared radiation could be responsible for the 1612-mhz emission and possibly the other oh masers .",
    "on the other hand , the intensity of the 1720-mhz and the absence of 1612-mhz absorption may indicate that collisional excitation is predominant .",
    "the oh velocity and line - to - continuum trends support a bar - like shape for the molecular cloud / dust complex in the following manner .",
    "the cloud may wrap behind ngc 6334-c ( or disappear ) and then curve forward towards ngc 6334-e and ngc 6334-a .",
    "this shape was first put forward by .",
    "they used the sequential theory of to suggest that star formation in the molecular cloud may have been triggered by an ob association located behind it .",
    "if the cloud were shaped like a tube which is bent away from the ob association ( resulting in more negative velocities towards the ends ) then a shock wave traveling from the ob association would hit the central part of the cloud first and then move outwards towards each end .",
    "this model was initially used to explain why the active sites of star - formation ( ngc 6334-v and -f ) are located at the end of the molecular cloud and the more evolved regions ( ngc 6334-c and -d ) nearer the centre . however",
    ", this model has been complicated by evidence of ongoing star - formation , such as infrared sources , outflows and oh maser emission ( this paper ) towards the central continuum concentrations .",
    "perhaps a burst of secondary star formation had begun in these regions .",
    "as stated previously , the line - to - continuum ratio is related to oh column densities but interpretation of the results can be confused if the continuum emission is located in front of the absorbing gas , which may be the case for ngc 6334-c and d. in regions where the oh gas appears to be concentrated near the edges of the continuum emission , the oh may be gradually becoming dissociated by the expanding ionized regions or used up for star formation . the column density of the extended molecular cloud increases towards each end of the continuum axis",
    "this could result from the increased line - of - sight path - length at the ends of the forward - curving molecular cloud .",
    "alternatively , it would be consistent with a gas supply not yet dissipated by existing @xmath1  regions or used up in star formation .",
    "if ngc 6334-c were more evolved than the other sources , it is feasible that the surrounding molecular cloud would be dissociated first .",
    "several cases of flips across the satellite - line profiles have been identified and they have been interpreted as a density gradient .",
    "there are no complete models which can explain these flips astrophysically .",
    "to explain their presence in our data , we suggest a simple model whereby an @xmath1concentration is located behind a more extended oh cloud .",
    "the oh cloud has a velocity range of @xmath45 to @xmath46 kms@xmath10  and consists of a low density layer , producing 1612-mhz absorption , and an adjacent high density layer , producing 1612-mhz emission .",
    "the transitional density is given by _",
    "km@xmath10 s @xmath27 .",
    "the high density layer , with velocities of @xmath32 to @xmath46 kms@xmath10  and which also include the @xmath1  velocities , is nearer the @xmath1  region and the low density layer , with velocities of @xmath45 to @xmath37 kms@xmath10 , is further out along the line of sight .    the adjacent 1612-mhz emission and absorption observed at the transitional velocity in ngc 6334-a ( @xmath37 kms@xmath10  of fig .",
    "11 ) may be explained if the direction of the density gradient within the oh cloud differs from the direction of the velocity gradient , and that isovelocity planes do not coincide with isodensity planes .",
    "the angle of deviation may be large enough so that at the transitional velocity it is possible to observe the low density gas on one side of the continuum emission and the high density gas on the other .",
    "we have imaged the 1.6-ghz continuum and the four transitions of the @xmath0 , j=3/2 ground state of oh towards the ngc 6334 @xmath1region / molecular cloud complex .",
    "observations were made with the australia telescope compact array with angular resolutions of @xmath18 arcsec@xmath19 and @xmath48 arcsec@xmath19 .",
    "the results are as follows :    \\(a ) _ 1.6-ghz continuum distribution _ - the continuum emission has been detected over an area of @xmath49 arcmin@xmath19 .",
    "the main region shows a set of aligned concentrations in stages of evolution ranging from compact regions to well - evolved shells .",
    "they are superimposed on a faint extended area .",
    "two additional southern regions appear as extended incomplete shells .",
    "\\(b ) _ oh maser emission _ - we have detected seven masers , plus a possible faint maser candidate . including the eighth possible maser , the masers are present for all oh transitions and appear to be associated with the continuum concentrations .",
    "two of the masers were detected towards ngc 6334-a .",
    "all maser locations include main - line transitions .",
    "the maser velocities vary between @xmath50 and 0.5 kms@xmath10 , with the more positive velocities located near the centre of the continuum distribution .",
    "\\(c ) _ extended oh distribution _ - main - line oh absorption was detected towards almost all of the continuum emission .",
    "the distribution of the line - to - continuum ratio at 1667-mhz ratio is uniform across the continuum and varies between @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the distribution is not enhanced towards the continuum emission but is concentrated in a bar extending northeast ",
    "southwest with its sharp south - eastern edge coincident with that of the optical dust lane .",
    "our velocity and line - to - continuum results support the notion in which the molecular bar wraps around the continuum emission .",
    "\\(d ) _ non - lte behaviour _    for the satellite lines ,",
    "one transition is commonly in emission with the other simultaneously in absorption .",
    "the 1612-mhz transition is in emission near the prominent radio continuum concentrations , presumably reflecting oh excitation by the infrared radiation associated with these concentrations . in some cases",
    ", the conjugate - type behaviour is observed to reverse across a spectral - line profile .",
    "this has been interpreted as a density gradient , and we have suggested that this reflects the presence of different cloud regimes along a line of sight .",
    "the main - line transitions show non - lte behaviour in that the @xmath53 intensity ratios range from 1.0 to 1.2 , significantly lower than the lte value of 1.8 .",
    "the results of the oh sum rule suggest that this discrepancy can only be explained in terms of high optical depth if the cloud is clumping on smaller scales .",
