    "there is much interest in the physical realisation of model systems for topological quantum computation ( tqc)@xcite .",
    "tqc is being actively explored as a physical way to achieve fault tolerent quantum computation . in this scheme",
    "the qubits are realised using non - abelian anyons .",
    "the braiding operations on them implement quantum gates robustly .",
    "one of the simplest class of non - abelian anyons are realised in systems with unpaired majorana fermions ( umf ) @xcite .",
    "kitaev presented a remarkable solvable spin-1/2 model on a honeycomb lattice @xcite which realises non - abelian anyons made up of umf .",
    "the model can be written in terms of majorana fermions in the background of @xmath1 gauge fields and the problem reduces to solving a theory of non - interacting majorana fermions in the background of static @xmath1 gauge field configurations .",
    "kitaev showed that the ground state is the flux free configuration .",
    "the model has a phase which is characterised by a topological invariant , the chern number of the fermions , being equal to @xmath2 . in this phase , there are umf trapped to each vortex ( a @xmath1 flux ) .",
    "thus , if vortices can be created and manipulated , it is possible to braid the umf .    while anyons ( abelian and non - abelian ) are intrinsically two dimensional objects , alicea _ et .",
    "al _ showed that the braiding operation of umf can be realised in one - dimensional wire networks @xcite .",
    "they proposed a realisation of such networks in semiconductor wires which can be engineered into a state supporting umf at the edges .",
    "kitaev s honeycomb model can easily be generalised to any lattice with coordination number three , if all the bonds can be coloured using three colours @xcite .",
    "there are theoretical proposals to realise such systems in cold atom systems @xcite and josephson junction quantum circuits @xcite .",
    "we had proposed and analysed such a generalised one dimensional model , which we called the tetrahedral model @xcite , where we showed that there are umf trapped to defects and that the defects could be created and manipulated by tuning the hamiltonian parameters . however , this required the engineering of 3-spin interactions which is not easy experimentally .",
    "in this paper we study a simpler quantum spin-1/2 chain which involves only 2-spin interactions and can thus , in principle , be realised in quantum circuits @xcite .",
    "the model has been studied earlier by leib , shultz and mattis @xcite , who showed that the model was exactly solvable using the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "they showed that the model has infinite conserved 2-spin operators and proved that the ground state was in the ( suitably defined ) defect free sector . in each defect configuration",
    ", the model reduces to an analytically solvable fermion hopping problem and is characterised by degenerate ground states , the exact degeneracy depending on the defect configuration .",
    "we solve the model exactly using kitaev s method @xcite .",
    "we reproduce the previous results @xcite and extend the validity of the regime of the proof of the ground state being the defect free sector .",
    "we then show that there are localised umf zero energy modes in the sectors with defects .",
    "the ground state degeneracy corresponds to these modes being occupied or unoccupied .",
    "the topological nature of these zero - energy modes makes them robust against disorder in the strengths of couplings in the hamiltonian . by tuning the couplings of the conserved 2-spin operators in the hamiltonian any defect sector",
    "can be made the ground state .",
    "thus it is possible to manipulate the umf and move them along the chain .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ xyz - ising ] ,",
    "we present the model , its conserved quantities and the jordan - wigner transformation which enables us to rewrite the theory in terms of majorana fermions hopping in the background of static @xmath1 gauge field configurations .",
    "the diagonalisation of the majorana fermion problem is described in section [ diagonal ] .",
    "section [ exactsol ] gives an exact analytic solution of the model . in section [ groundstate ] , we present a proof that the groundstate lies in the defect free sector .",
    "our proof has a larger regime of validity than the one given previously@xcite .",
    "it also yields an expression for fermionic gap .",
    "section [ zeromode ] contains a detailed analysis of the zero modes of the majorana fermions .",
    "we show that the zero mode and , therefore , degeneracy in the multiparticle spectrum is topological in origin and is robust under the variation of the couplings in the hamiltonian .",
    "we summarise our results and discuss them in the concluding section [ conclusion ] .",
    "and @xmath3 bonds are as indicated . ]",
    "we consider the hamiltonian , @xmath4 with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath5    in each unit cell , there is a conserved @xmath1 invariant , @xmath6 . apart from these @xmath7 local conserved quantities ,",
    "there are also three global conserved quantities corresponding to global @xmath8 rotations about each of the three axes which are symmetries of the model .",
    "we denote these by , @xmath9 these are not independent , we have @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we see that the @xmath12 terms in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) are invariants and , hence , do not affect the eigenstates . in this work we concentrate on @xmath13 .",
    "as we will show , at this point the model is analytically solvable .",
    "also , note that this point the model has a global @xmath14 symmetry corresponding to spin rotations about the @xmath3 axis .",
    "leib et al had studied the model at the @xmath15 point and had called it the heisenberg - ising model .",
    "we follow their nomenclature and refer to the model in equation ( [ ham ] ) with @xmath16 as the @xmath17-ising model .",
    "we express the hamiltonian in terms of majorana fermions using the jordan - wigner transformation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "then , the hamiltonian reduces to , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are conserved quantities .",
    "the majorana operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 follow the anti - commutation relations , @xmath25 thus , the spin hamiltonian gets converted into the fermionic hamiltonian with periodic boundary condition when @xmath26 and with anti - periodic boundary conditions when @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian can be diagonalised in the standard way .",
    "we write the eigenstates as direct products of states @xmath28 in the @xmath29 fermion sector and states @xmath30 in the @xmath31 fermion sector",
    ". we will refer to states belonging to @xmath29 fermion sector as the gauge sector and states belonging to @xmath31 fermion sector as matter sector .",
    "we choose the states in the gauge sector to be the simultaneous eigenstates of the @xmath1 flux operators , i.e @xmath32 , where    @xmath33    we then have @xmath34\\vert{\\cal m}\\rangle \\vert\\{u_i\\}\\rangle= h\\left[u_i\\right]\\vert{\\cal m}\\rangle \\vert\\{u_i\\}\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the single particle eigenvalue equation is given by , @xmath35 with boundary condition @xmath36    we define the @xmath37 sector as the then defect free sector .",
    "this zero defect sector consists of two sectors corresponding to periodic or anti - periodic boundary conditions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively . we will prove that this is the ground state sector of the model .",
    "if @xmath40 of the @xmath41 s are equal to @xmath42 then we call it the @xmath40-defect sector",
    ". an @xmath40 defect sector reduces to solving the hopping problem on @xmath40 decoupled open chains .",
    "if we can solve one defect sector ( one open chain ) , then we can solve all the sectors of the model because all of them reduce to decoupled open chain hamiltonians .",
    "in this section we put @xmath43 since the eigenstates are independent of @xmath12 .",
    "we first consider the zero - defect sector of a chain with @xmath7 unit cells , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath44 .",
    "the hamitonian is diagonalised in terms of the fourier components of the majorana fermion operators , @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 being the lattice spacing , we have supressed the sub - lattice index and @xmath23 represent two component column vectors .",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath23 implies that @xmath48 , their components satisfy the canonical anti - commutation relations , @xmath49 fermionic modes are thus defined on half the brillouin zone .",
    "the momentum space hamiltonian is , @xmath50 the hamiltonian in the diagonalised form is expressed as @xmath51 where , @xmath52 thus , the sytem is gapped for @xmath53 .",
    "the values of @xmath54 are determined by applying the boundary condition ( [ boundcon ] ) , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 for ( pbc ) and anti-(pbc ) respectively .",
    "we now consider the one defect sector .",
    "the fermionic system is then an open chain with @xmath7 unit cells satisfying the boundary conditions , @xmath58 we use the standing waves to diagonalise this open chain single particle hamiltonian , @xmath59 the boundary conditions ( [ openboundcond ] ) imply that @xmath60 thus , @xmath54 are determined by the solution of , @xmath61 we have solved equation ( [ allowed_k1 ] ) numerically for @xmath62 and plotted @xmath54 versus @xmath40 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 as shown in figure [ kversusn.fig ] .     and @xmath40 without the correction @xmath65 .",
    "the green and blue line shows the plot between @xmath54 and @xmath40 for @xmath66 and for @xmath67 respectively . ]",
    "we see the number of allowed values of @xmath54 is @xmath7 for @xmath63 but is @xmath68 when @xmath64 .",
    "as we will show later , the missing mode is a zero energy eigenfunction of the single particle hamiltonian with the wavefunction peaked at the edges of the open chain .",
    "the relation @xmath69 has been shown in the argand plane in the figure ( [ complexplane1 ] ) and figure ( [ complexplane2 ] ) .",
    "the appearance of the zero mode depends on the topology of parameters of hamiltonian as shown in figure ( [ complexplane1 ] ) and ( [ complexplane2 ] ) .",
    "zero mode appears when the unit circle shown there encloses the origin .",
    "this argument can be generalised to show that if the path circles the origin @xmath70 times , then there will be @xmath70 only @xmath71 standing waves .",
    "@xmath70 can be identified with a topological invariant of the closed chain in terms of the berry potential defined on the half - brillioun zone of the closed chain , @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the two - component single particle wavefunctions .",
    "the topological invariant is the winding number of the relative phase of the two components of the wavefunction along the half brillioun zone , @xmath74     in argand plane .",
    "for @xmath67 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . ]     in argand plane . for @xmath66 , @xmath75 and @xmath77",
    "the geometric interpretation of @xmath70 is as follows .",
    "consider a general hamiltonian of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the hamiltonian in equation ( [ spham ] ) is the case of @xmath80 and @xmath81 . for fully connected near neighbour chains , the off - diagonal terms in the single particle hamiltonian in equation do not vanish implying that @xmath82 for any @xmath54",
    "further , if @xmath83 the hamitonian in equation ( [ genham ] ) represents a mapping of the half - brillioun zone to the sphere with two points removed ( the north and south poles in our convention ) , which is topologically equivalent to an annulus .",
    "thus , @xmath70 which is the winding number of the map is a topological invariant for the class of gapped chains for which no nearest neighbour hopping amplitude vanishes .",
    "thus , we expect the zero energy edge state to be robust and independent of disorder in the couplings , provided the system remains gapped and fully connected by nearest neighbour couplings .",
    "we will demonstrate this explicitly in a later section .",
    "the solution of the open chain presented above can be used to to solve @xmath40 defect sector , for any @xmath40 as these sectors consist of @xmath40 decoupled open chains .",
    "in this section , we will prove that zero defect sector is the ground state sector for @xmath43 . in order to prove the statement we first prove that the ground state energy of zero defect sector is less than that of one defect sector for large @xmath7 .",
    "we then prove that ground state energy of one defect sector is less than or equal to that of the @xmath40-defect sector .",
    "we then turn on @xmath12 and compute regime of the stability of the system to defect formation .",
    "we finally compare our results with those of lieb _ et .",
    "al._@xcite and point out precisely how our proof extends the regime of validity of their result .",
    "* first step : * we outline the proof that the ground state energy of zero defect sector @xmath84 is less that of the one defect sector , @xmath85 . the details are given in appendix [ proof ] .",
    "the ground state energies of the two sectors are , @xmath86 in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath44 , we convert the summations into integrals using the euler - maclaurin formula to get , @xmath87 we then show in appendix that @xmath88 for all finite @xmath89 , thus proving that the ground state energy of zero defect sector is less than that of the one defect sector .    *",
    "second step : * now , we show that the ground state energy of one defect sector is less than that of two defect sector and so on . to show this , we split up hamiltonian into three parts , @xmath90 where h is the hamiltonian for one defect sector , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are hamiltonians of lengths @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath94 is the link bond between @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    from variational principle , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the ground state energy of hamiltonian for one defect sector .",
    "using the trial wave function @xmath97 , we get @xmath98 let us consider the link hamiltonian @xmath99 where @xmath100 belongs to the hamiltonian @xmath91 and @xmath101 belongs to the hamiltonian @xmath92 .",
    "then , @xmath102 since the expectation value of single @xmath100 operator in the ground state is zero .",
    "therefore , @xmath103    thus , we have proved that the ground state energy of one defect sector is less than the ground state energy of two defect sector .",
    "similarly , we can prove for two defect sector and so on .",
    "therefore , zero defect sector is the ground state sector at @xmath43 .",
    "we now turn on @xmath12 and examine the region of stability of the zero defect sector under defect production .",
    "the difference of the ground state energies of the zero and one defect sector for non - zero @xmath12 is @xmath104 thus , the system will become unstable towards defect production when @xmath105 this extends the result of lieb _ et .",
    "_ since their proof is not valid for negative values of @xmath12 .      for @xmath106 ,",
    "the zero defect is the ground state sector .",
    "the first excited state can be either the first excitation in the zero defect sector or the ground state of the one defect sector .",
    "the excitation gap in the zero defect sector follows from the single particle spectrum and is given by @xmath107 therefore , model is gapless for @xmath108 .",
    "numerically , we have shown that for @xmath43 first excited state of the model in the region @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the ground state of the one defect sector .",
    "the excited state of the zero defect sector is the first excited state in the region @xmath111 .",
    "these results have been shown in figure ( [ lowenergyexcitation.fig ] ) .",
    "we also see that the model has a finite gap for all non - zero values of @xmath112 .",
    "we now analyse the zero mode of the majorana fermions .",
    "when @xmath113 , equations ( [ 1defectsingle ] ) decouple and become @xmath114 these recursion relations can formally be solved , @xmath115 there are two degenerate and independent solutions for every set of values of the parameters and every flux configuration . in zero defect sector , imposing boundary condition @xmath116 , we find that the zero modes exist for zero defect sector only at the gapless point @xmath108 . in one defect sector , which is an open chain with boundary condition @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 can be expressed as , @xmath120 we can see that if @xmath63 , then @xmath119 becomes zero at the boundary for infinite open chain .",
    "now , if we take @xmath121 , then the boundary condition at the other end @xmath122 is also satisfied for @xmath123 . therefore , the only one solution for zero mode exist in an infinite chain for @xmath63 . the same is true for the case @xmath64 . in both cases ,",
    "we get only one non - zero solution for zero mode .",
    "thus , the zero mode occurs when the toplogical invariant is non - zero .",
    "it can also be seen from the recursive solution presented above that the zero modes exist even if the coupling , @xmath89 varies with @xmath124 .",
    "thus the zero mode topologically protected against random , spatial variations in the exchange coupling .",
    "to summarize , we have analysed an exactly solvable spin-1/2 chain which was earlier studied by lieb , shultz and mattis @xcite .",
    "we have shown that it is a generalised kitaev chain . using the methods of kitaev @xcite we can reproduce the earlier results .",
    "the formalism also helps us extend the earlier proof to negative vlaues of @xmath12 and compute the value of @xmath12 when the defect free state becomes unstable to defect production .",
    "in addition we have explicitly displayed the topological nature of the zero energy modes in the presence of defects .",
    "we have identified the topological invariant that determines the existence of zero energy edge modes in the system . thus the degeneracy is protected against random variations in the exchange coupling .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results show that zero energy majorana modes can be created and manipulated in this model exactly in the same way shown in previous work@xcite .",
    "the system has a gap for all non - zero values of @xmath125 .",
    "thus the umf can used as a topological qubit .",
    "the importance of this model is that it has only two - spin couplings which can , in principle , be realised experimentally@xcite .",
    "we thank deepak dhar for a very useful discussion .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath84 of zero defect sector is expressed as @xmath126 where @xmath127 .    to evaluate the summation series we convert it into integral using euler - maclaurin formula , @xmath128\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{k=1}^p\\frac{b_{2k}}{(2k)!}\\left(f^{(2k-1)}(n)-f^{(2k-1)}(0)\\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 are the bernoulli numbers .",
    "to evaluate the summation series , we convert it into integral using euler - maclaurin formula and neglect last terms containing ( n+1 ) in the denominator in limit @xmath130 , @xmath134.\\label{gseods2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the thermodynamic limit @xmath130 , above equation ( [ gseods2 ] ) becomes , @xmath135.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us substitute @xmath136 , and above expression for ground state energy for one defect sector becomes @xmath137.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using taylor expansion and neglecting terms containing @xmath138 , @xmath139    using integration by parts in the second term and then taking the thermodynamic limit , we get @xmath140\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{\\pi } \\left [ \\alpha(\\pi)\\epsilon(\\pi)+\\alpha(0)\\epsilon(0)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from figures ( [ complexplane1 ] , [ complexplane2 ] ) , @xmath141 substituting all these values , we show that for both cases @xmath63 and @xmath64 ground state energy of one defect sector is expressed as , @xmath142 since in the expression for @xmath143 the integrand is always less than 1 , we can write @xmath144 therefore , from equation ( [ finstate ] ) , we can say that the ground state energy of zero defect sector is less than ground state energy of one defect sector .",
