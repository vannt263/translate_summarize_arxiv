    "@xcite this change of behavior is easily understood because the number @xmath17 of srmno@xmath6 layers control the quantum confinement potential : when @xmath17 is small , the confinement potential is small and the @xmath18 electrons are distributed uniformly , thus expecting the phases similar to the alloy la@xmath10sr@xmath11mno@xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath17 is large , the confinement potential becomes large enough to trap the @xmath18 electrons in lamno@xmath6 layers , and thus the bulk properties of lamno@xmath0 and srmno@xmath6 would be observed .",

    "@xcite although the similar physical principles found in ( lamno@xmath6)@xmath2/(srmno@xmath6)@xmath1 superlattices are certainly expected to apply here , the systematic theoretical investigations are required to understand the main ingredients which determine the electronic as well as the magnetic properties of ( lamno@xmath6)@xmath1/(srmno@xmath6)@xmath2 superlattices .    here , in this paper , performing first - principles calculations based on the density functional theory , we study the electronic and the magnetic structures of ( lamno@xmath6)@xmath1/(srmno@xmath6)@xmath2 ( 001 ) superlattices with @xmath3 . we show that the magnetic properties are governed not only by the quantum confinement potential caused by periodic alignment of cation ions la@xmath15/sr@xmath20 but also by the strain induced by substrates on which the superlattices are grown .",
    "namely , for the case of tensile strain induced by srtio@xmath6 ( sto ) ( 001 ) substrate , our calculations show that the ground state of these superlattices are a - type antiferromagnetic and @xmath7 orbital ordered with higher @xmath19 for @xmath21 than for @xmath22 .",
