    "this paper begins an investigation motivated by the physics of string theory , in particular the  f - theory and heterotic duality \" which predicts unexpected relations between certain @xmath1 dimensional elliptically fibered calabi - yau varieties with section ( the f - theory models ) and certain principal bundles over @xmath2 dimensional calabi - yau varieties ( the heterotic models ) , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . recently",
    "this duality has also been used to construct realistic models in string theory , see for example the survey @xcite .",
    "the duality is conjectured to be between @xmath1 dimensional calabi yau varieties which are @xmath0 fibered and @xmath2 dimensional calabi - yau variety elliptically fibered over the same base @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when @xmath3 , that is the duality is between f - theory on an elliptically fibered @xmath0 surface with section and heterotic theory on an elliptic curve , the elliptic curve and the bundles are obtained by a suitable semistable degeneration of the @xmath0 surface ; this semistable degeneration is the starting point of the duality in higher dimension @xcite .",
    "it is neither straightforward nor easy to produce these pairs of dual varieties . in the 90s , candelas and collaborators , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and also @xcite",
    "proposed a clever and quick algorithm to find the heterotic calabi - yau duals @xmath4 for _ certain _ calabi - yau manifolds @xmath5 which are hypersurfaces in toric fano varieties @xmath6 .",
    "berglund and mayr @xcite proposed an explicit construction which assigns to each given toric variety of dimension @xmath1 a toric variety of dimension @xmath2 together with a specific family of sheaves on it .",
    "this systematic construction produces many interesting examples of conjectured f - theory / heterotic dual in the toric context .",
    "the essence of these algorithms is a sequence of _ suitable _ projections from the toric fan of @xmath6 .",
    "candelas and collaborators , berglund and mayr check via other physics dualities that the constructions produces the expected pair of dual varieties and the group , but the mathematical reasoning behind this , that is the connection to the semistable degeneration , remains elusive .",
    "this paper represents a first step towards the ultimate goal , mentioned in the paper of hu , liu and yau @xcite , to present the f - theory / heterotic analogue of batyrev s constructions of toric mirrors .",
    "we consider the case of @xmath0 surfaces / elliptic curves , which are the building block for higher dimensional f - theory / heterotic duality .",
    "when the duality is between f - theory on an elliptically fibered @xmath0 surface with section and heterotic theory on an elliptic curve , clingher and morgan proved that certain regions of the moduli space of such heterotic theories and their f - theory counterparts can be identified as dual @xcite . the authors consider a partial compactification of the moduli spaces of the smooth elliptic @xmath0 surfaces with section , by adding two divisors at infinity @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; the points of the boundary divisors correspond to semistable degenerations of @xmath0 surfaces given by the union of two rational elliptic surfaces glued together along an elliptic curve in two different ways .",
    "an elliptic curve @xmath9 ( the double curve of the degeneration ) is then shown to be the heterotic dual of the @xmath0 ; the elliptic curve is endowed with a flat @xmath10-bundle .",
    "the lie group @xmath10 is @xmath11 for one boundary divisor and @xmath12 for the other .",
    "we give a mathematical definition for the properties of the examples of candelas and collaborators , which we refer to as candelas conditions in section [ sec : candelasexamples ] and proof several theorems , in particular [ cf ] and [ toricbat ] , which provide an explanation , in term of semistable degeneration , of candelas algorithm , and part of berglund - mayr s construction .",
    "the main idea is to combine techniques from symplectic geometry , namely the symplectic cut of the moment polytope @xcite , @xcite , with an appropriate notion of a weierstrass model , adapted to the toric context .",
    "the dual newton ( moment ) polytope is the polytope naturally associated to fano toric varieties , whose lattice points correspond to the sections of the anticanonical bundle .    in section [ background ] , after some general facts about toric fano varieties and their calabi - yau hypersurfaces we explain how the inclusion of a @xmath13-dimensional reflexive polytope determines the elliptic fibration .",
    "this observation , long known in the physics literature , is the starting point of rohsiepe s analysis for higher dimensional calabi - yau elliptic fibrations @xcite : we use it to construct the elliptic fibrations in the examples . here  top and bottom \" are used to identify the inverse image(s ) of the fixed points of @xmath14 under the torus action , and the corresponding singular fibers of the elliptic fibration .",
    "we give a summary of candelas conditions in section [ sec : candelasexamples ] .",
    "the surjection condition 2 ) appears in all the candelas examples : it is a novel idea , somewhat hidden in candelas papers and central in berglund - mayr .",
    "we recast the conditions in a mathematical context in the following section [ polytopesfibrationssection ] . in [ semistablepolys ] we define the semistable polytopes , which play the role of building blocks in the examples in above mentioned papers .",
    "a semistable polytope will satisfy the candelas conditions 1 ) and 3 ) stated in section [ sec : candelasexamples ] .",
    "the particular class of polytopes theorem [ th : exun ] satisfies all the candelas conditions ; in section [ subsec : cf ] we actually show that all the polytopes which satisfy the candelas conditions can be constructed from semistable polytopes . in section [ sections ] we show that condition 3 ) corresponds to the existence of a  section at @xmath15 \" of the elliptic fibration of the k3 surface .",
    "we show that the existence of the section at @xmath16 and condition 1 ) implies the existence of a _ toric _ weierstrass model , which we call the _ candelas - font weierstrass _ model ( section [ subsec : cf ] ) .",
    "we characterize these models in theorem [ th : diagr ] .",
    "theorem [ th : projection ] characterizes candelas examples .",
    "it was noted by @xcite and @xcite that these calabi - yau varieties yield mirror elliptic fibrations .    in section [ sec : tntsections ] we proof an easy combinatorial condition for the existence of a section of the elliptic fibration .",
    "the symplectic cut is the focus of section [ symplecticcut ] .",
    "we show that candelas conditions 1 ) and 2 ) correspond to the existence of a codimension one slice in the moment polytope , which cuts it into two `` nice '' parts ( theorem [ semistablepartition ] ) .",
    "we then show that these conditions give a `` symplectic cut '' which determines a toric semistable degeneration of the original fano variety into two other semistable toric varieties ; this degeneration induces a natural semistable degeneration of the calabi - yau hypersurface , ( theorems [ cf ] and [ toricbat ] ) .",
    "remark [ rmk : cutswithinftysection ] concludes that candelas conditions 1 ) , 2 ) and 3 ) , or equivalently theorem [ th : projection ] , imply that the elliptically fibered @xmath0 degenerates to two rational elliptic surfaces glued along a fiber and the degeneration preserves the elliptic fibration which induces a semistable degeneration of the section at infinity .    the idea of the symplectic cut can be applied also in higher dimensional fibrations ; we leave this for further studies : we believe that @xcite contains many useful techniques for this purpose",
