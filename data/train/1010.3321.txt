    "the unexpected behavior of some fusion - evaporation cross sections at energies far below the coulomb barrier , has challenged the theoretical models to explain the , so called , fusion hinderance phenomena in true coupled - channels calculations ( ccc ) for reactions such as @xmath4ni+@xmath4ni , @xmath1ni+@xmath1ni , and @xmath1ni+@xmath2mo @xcite .",
    "the ccc could , however , be sensitive to the so far unobserved , hence not - included , high - lying states .",
    "misicu and esbensen @xcite were the first who succeeded in describing the above said three reactions in terms of a density - dependent m3y interaction , modified by adding a repulsive core potential @xcite .",
    "the repulsive core changes the shape of the inner part of the potential in terms of a thicker barrier ( reduced curvature @xmath5 ) and shallower pocket . here , deformations are included up to hexadecapole ( @xmath6 ) and the orientation degrees of freedom is integrated over all the allowed values in the same plane .",
    "the dynamical cluster - decay model ( dcm ) of preformed clusters by gupta and collaborators @xcite is found recently @xcite to have barrier modification effects as the inbuilt property , where  barrier lowering \" at sub - barrier energies arise in a natural way in its fitting of the only parameter of model , the neck - length parameter .",
    "the difference of actually - calculated barrier from the actually - used barrier height , corresponding to the neck - length parameter for best - fitted fusion - evaporation cross section , gives the  barrier lowering \" in dcm , whose values are found to increase as the incident energy decreases to sub - barrier energies .",
    "calculations are based on @xmath7 deformations and orientation @xmath8-dependent nuclear proximity potential of blocki _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "very recently , the wong formula @xcite is also extended by gupta and collaborators @xcite to include its angular momentum @xmath0-summation explicitly , which is also shown to contain the barrier modification effects due to the @xmath0-dependent barriers . however , for the @xmath3ni - based fusion - evaporation cross sections @xcite , a further modification of barriers is found essential for below - barrier energies , which is implemented empirically either by  lowering the barrier \" or  narrowing the barrier curvature \" by a fixed amount for all @xmath0 s in the potential calculated by using the proximity potential of blocki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , but with multipole deformations @xmath6 and @xmath8-integrated for co - planer nuclei . apparently , the depth of the potential pocket plays no role , in both the dcm and @xmath0-summed wong formula ( the two models are same for capture reactions ) .    in this contribution",
    ", we use within the @xmath0-summed wong model , the nuclear proximity potential obtained recently @xcite for the skyrme nucleus - nucleus interaction in the semiclassical etf approach . using sedf ,",
    "the universal function of proximity potential is obtained as a sum of the parametrized spin - orbit - density - independent and the spin - orbit - density - dependent universal functions ( uf s ) , with different parameters of uf s obtained for different skyrme forces @xcite .",
    "this method has the advantage of introducing the barrier modifications at sub - barrier energies , if needed , by either ( i ) modifying the fermi density parameters ( the half - density radii and/ or surface thicknesses , for  exact \" sedf calculations @xcite ) , ( ii ) the constants of the parametrized uf s @xcite or ( iii ) change the skyrme force itself since a different skyrme force would give different barrier characteristics ( height and curvature ) .",
    "this later possibility is exploited here in this paper .",
    "it is possible that some skyrme force would fit the data for one reaction , but not for another reaction and hence requiring  barrier modification \" or another skyrme force .",
    "section 2 gives briefly the semiclassical etf method using sedf , including details of approximations used for adding densities .",
    "section 3 discusses the @xmath0-summed wong formula @xcite .",
    "our calculations are given in section 4 , and a brief summary of results in section 5 .",
    "the sedf in semiclassical etf method provides a convenient way for calculating the interaction potential between two nuclei . in the hamiltnian density ,",
    "the kinetic energy density @xmath9 as well as the spin - orbit density @xmath10 are functions of the nucleon density @xmath11 , @xmath12 . for the composite system",
    ", the densities can be added in either adiabatic or sudden approximation , but we are interested in sudden densites since the different terms of skyrme hamiltonian density are then found to constitute the nuclear proximity potential @xcite .",
    "the sudden densities are defined with or without exchange effects ( due to anti - symmetrization ) , and the one without exchange effects is also refered to as frozen density @xcite . in etf method , the lowest order @xmath9 is the thomas fermi ( tf ) kinetic energy density @xmath13 , which already contains a large part of the exchange effects , and that the higher order terms include exchange effects in full .",
