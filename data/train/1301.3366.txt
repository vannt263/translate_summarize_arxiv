    "neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay ( @xmath27 ) is one of the most promising probes for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the process is sensitive to lepton number violation , the nature of the neutrino ( majorana or dirac particle ) , the absolute neutrino mass and the neutrino mass hierarchy ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , the investigation of neutrinoless double - electron capture ( @xmath28 ) and of electron capture with positron emission ( @xmath29 ) could clarify the possible contribution of the right - handed currents to the @xmath30 decay rate @xcite .",
    "the osmium contains two potentially double-@xmath0 active isotopes : @xmath2os ( energy of decay @xmath31 kev @xcite ; isotopic abundance @xmath32% @xcite ; allowed decay channels : @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) and @xmath6os ( @xmath35 kev @xcite ; @xmath36% @xcite ; @xmath37 ) .",

    "the most promising of them is the level @xmath39 1322.2 kev @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the radiopurity of the osmium sample and realized the first search for double-@xmath0 processes in @xmath2os and @xmath6os with the help of an ultra - low background hpge @xmath1 spectrometer .",
    "preliminary results of the experiment were presented in @xcite .",
    "an ultra - pure osmium sample ( more than 99.999% purity grade @xcite ) with a mass of 173 g was used in the experiment .",
    "the material was obtained using electron - beam melting of osmium powder with further purification by electron - beam zone refining .",
    "the estimated density of the metal is 23 g/@xmath40 ( the tabulated value is 22.57 g/@xmath40 @xcite ) .",
    "the sample contains @xmath41 nuclei of @xmath2os and @xmath42 nuclei of @xmath6os assume the natural isotopic composition @xcite .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the gran sasso national laboratories of the infn ( italy ) with the ultra - low background hpge detector gecris with a volume of 465 @xmath40 .",
    "the detector is shielded by lead ( @xmath43 cm ) and copper ( @xmath44 cm ) .",
    "the fwhm energy resolution of the spectrometer is 2.0 kev for the 1333 kev @xmath1 quanta of @xmath11co .",
    "the data with the sample were accumulated over 2741 h , while the background spectrum was taken over 1046 h. the spectra are presented in fig .",
    "3 .      the peaks in the energy distributions can be ascribed to @xmath1 quanta of u / th daughters , @xmath10k , @xmath11co , @xmath7cs , @xmath8os and @xmath9bi .",
    "the response functions of the detector to decays of these nuclides as well as to the double-@xmath0 processes in the osmium isotopes were simulated by egsnrc @xcite and geant4 @xcite packages with initial kinematics given by the decay0 event generator @xcite .",

    "the energy spectrum was fitted in the energy interval ( @xmath75 ) kev by the model consisting of five gaussians ( to describe the expected x ray peaks ) plus a polynomial function of the first degree ( background ) .",
    "the fit provides the total area of the @xmath74 effect ( @xmath76 ) counts , which corresponds to @xmath77 counts ( see fig .",
    "the detection efficiency of the whole effect in this case is calculated as : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 are the efficiencies for the specific x lines with energies from 58.0 kev to 69.1 kev .",
    "taking into account @xmath80 , one can calculate the following half - life limit :    @xmath81os , g.s.@xmath70g.s.@xmath82 yr .    the sensitivity of the experiment to the @xmath83 decay of @xmath2os to the 111.2 kev excited level of @xmath2w is estimated from the fit of the energy spectrum accumulated with the osmium sample in the vicinity of the energy 111.2 kev .",
    "the fit gives an area for the @xmath1 peak of ( @xmath84 ) counts , that leads to @xmath85 counts ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "the detection efficiency for the 111.2 kev @xmath1 quanta , taking into account the fact that the transition from the 111.2 kev excited level to the ground state of @xmath2w is efficiently converted to electrons ( the experimental coefficient of conversion is @xmath86 @xcite ) , was calculated to be 0.076% .",
    "generally speaking , due to the large coefficient of conversion to electrons , the sensitivity of the experiment should be different for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 captures .",
    "for example , since both @xmath90 electrons are already captured in the @xmath87 process , the conversion from the @xmath90 shell is prohibited in further 111.2 kev deexcitation process .",
    "the coefficients of conversion from different atomic shells can be calculated with the bricc program @xcite .",
    "however , the excited 111.2 kev level of @xmath2w has quite a long half - life of 1.251 ns @xcite compared to the characteristic atomic relaxation time of @xmath91 s ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we consider that the relaxation processes in the w atomic shell after the initial @xmath83 capture are finished before the 111.2 kev deexcitation and we can apply the value @xmath92 for all @xmath83 captures .",
    "this gives :    @xmath93os , g.s.@xmath70111.2 kev@xmath94 yr .    to estimate limits on the @xmath83 decay of @xmath2os to the @xmath95 903.3 kev",
    ", @xmath96 1002.5 kev and @xmath95 1121.4 kev excited levels of @xmath2w , the energy spectrum accumulated with the osmium sample was fitted in the energy intervals where intense @xmath1 peaks from the de - excitation process are expected .",
    "for instance , we have obtained the following limit on the @xmath83 decay of @xmath2os to the excited 903.3 kev level of @xmath2w by the fit of the data in the energy interval ( @xmath97 ) kev where the 903.3 kev @xmath1 peak is expected :    @xmath93os , g.s.@xmath98kev@xmath99 yr .    the limits obtained for the @xmath83 decay of @xmath2os to the excited levels of @xmath2w are presented in table  2 .    in the neutrinoless double - electron capture in addition to x rays",
    "we suppose that only one bremsstrahlung @xmath1 quantum is emitted @xcite to take away the rest of the energy , which in the @xmath64 process is taken by the neutrinos . in the case of the @xmath38",
    "double- electron capture from @xmath90 and @xmath100 shells , the energy of the @xmath1 quanta is expected to be equal to @xmath101 , where @xmath102 are the binding energies of the captured electrons on the @xmath90 and @xmath100 atomic shells of tungsten @xcite : @xmath103 kev , @xmath104 kev , @xmath105 kev , @xmath106 kev .",
    "therefore , the expected energies of the quanta for the @xmath28 capture in @xmath2os to the ground state of @xmath2w are : @xmath107 kev for @xmath87 , @xmath108 kev for @xmath88 and @xmath109 ) kev for @xmath89",
    ". there are no clear peaks in the data with these energies ( see fig .",
    "we have estimated the values of @xmath55 by fitting the data in the energy intervals with the simple model : a gaussian function ( to describe the peaks searched for ) plus a polynomial function ( continuous background ) . taking into account the calculated efficiencies to detect @xmath1 quanta with energies of @xmath110 mev ( @xmath111 ) ,",
    "we set the following limits on the processes searched for :    @xmath112os , g.s.@xmath113g.s.@xmath114 yr ,    @xmath115os , g.s.@xmath113g.s.@xmath116 yr ,    @xmath117os , g.s.@xmath113g.s.@xmath118 yr .    the @xmath119 energy of @xmath2os allows also the population of several excited levels of @xmath2w .",
    "the limits obtained for the processes of @xmath28 decay to the ground and to the excited levels of the daughter nuclei are presented in table 2 .",
    "the neutrinoless double - electron capture of @xmath2os to the excited levels of @xmath2w with energies of 1322.2 kev , 1386.3 kev and 1431.0 kev may occur with higher probability due to a possible resonant enhancement .",
    "the double capture on the @xmath39 1322.2 kev level was considered as the most promising with a half - life in the range ( @xmath120 ) yr for the majorana neutrino mass of 1 ev @xcite value for the double- @xmath0 decay of @xmath2os @xcite , the authors have concluded that the half - life of the transition exceeds @xmath121 yr . ] .",
    "limits on resonant double - electron capture in @xmath2os from @xmath90 and @xmath100 shells were obtained by analyzing the experimental spectrum in the energy intervals where the most strongest @xmath1 lines from the de - excitation of these levels are expected .",
    "for example , the greatest sensitivity to the resonant @xmath87 capture in @xmath2os to the excited @xmath122 level of @xmath2w with an energy of 1322.2 kev is obtained by searching for the de - excitation @xmath1-ray with an energy 903.3 kev , yielding the limit :    @xmath123os , g.s.@xmath124 kev@xmath125 yr .",
    "limits on the resonant double - electron captures to the excited levels @xmath95 1386.3 kev and @xmath95 1431.0 kev were obtained in a similar way .",
    "the half - life limits on the resonant @xmath33 processes in @xmath2os are presented in table  2 .      to set a limit on the @xmath37 transition of @xmath6os to the @xmath95 316.5 kev excited level of @xmath6pt ,",
    "the energy spectrum was fitted by a straight line ( which represents the background model ) and a gaussian at 316.5 kev .",
    "the energy spectrum in the vicinity of the peak is presented in fig .",
    "7 . taking into account the detection efficiency ( @xmath127 both for the @xmath64 and @xmath38 modes of the decay )",
    ", we have obtained the following limit :    @xmath128os , g.s.@xmath129 kev@xmath130 yr .",
    "the radiopurity of an osmium sample has been investigated and the first experiment to search for @xmath52 processes in @xmath2os and @xmath6os was carried out by using ultra - low background hpge @xmath1 spectrometry .",
    "after 2741 h of data taking with a 173 g ultra - pure osmium sample limits on double - beta processes in @xmath2os have been established at the level of @xmath131 ) yr . a possible resonant neutrinoless double - electron capture in @xmath2os to the excited 1322.2 kev , 1386.3 kev and",
    "1431.0 kev states of @xmath2w are bound at the level of @xmath132 yr .",
    "the @xmath37 decay of @xmath6os to the first excited level of @xmath6pt is restricted to @xmath133 yr at 90% cl .",
    "the osmium sample has subsequently been placed in a well - type ultra low background hpge detector especially designed for low energy @xmath1 rays spectrometry decay of @xmath2os and @xmath134os to the excited levels of their daughter nuclei ( see @xcite where an indication for @xmath135 decay of @xmath2os to the first excited level ( 103.5 kev ) of @xmath136w with the half - life @xmath137 yr was obtained ) . ] .",
    "in such a way we expect to improve the sensitivity of the experiment at least to the @xmath74 decay , which is the most probable double - beta process in @xmath2os .",
    "further progress can be achieved by using osmium enriched in @xmath2os , although this will require new enrichment techniques to be developed .",
