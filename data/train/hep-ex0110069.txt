    "one of the most vital tasks of an experiment using a polarized hadron collider in a new energy region is the study of physics beyond the standard model . in the past few years , several theoretical works @xcite have been devoted to the studies of the contact interaction ( or , compositeness ) @xcite and new gauge bosons @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite . in these theoretical works ,",
    "@xcite it has been shown that rhic can reach a similar sensitivity to that of the tevatron , due to its polarized beam .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to explore the discovery potential for physics beyond the standard model from the experimental perspective .",
    "considering the family pattern of quarks and leptons , compositeness is an fascinating idea . for there are no standard sub - quark models ,",
    "model independent treatment using a compositeness scale @xmath2 is often used .",
    "we call such new generalized interaction as the contact interaction .",
    "one possible feynmann diagram is shown in fig.[cifmdy ] . for any kind of an new interaction with energy scale @xmath2",
    "can be taken into account , for example , new gauge boson exchange between `` standard '' quarks can be understood as a kind of the contact interaction .",
    "@xmath2 is a model - independent scale parameter of the contact interaction , defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a ` form factor ' of the quark and lepton .",
    "therefore , sometimes one interpret the physical meanings of the the contact interaction as quark ( lepton ) compositeness .",
    "however , the contact interaction has general formalism , so any kind of new interaction can be roughly included .",
    "in order to study physics sensitivity and to determine a search window , simulation studies with an event generator are indispensable . several non - standard scenarios can be examined using pythia .",
    "the contact interaction can be also examined through it . however , as with all other subprocesses , pythia includes only helicity - averaged cross sections for the contact interaction .",
    "the author developed a plug - in program ` polby ' for pythia by which hadronic spin asymmetries for drell - yan and quark - scattering process can be examined .",
    "helicity - selected matrix elements have been theoretically obtained in lo not only for the standard model but also for the contact interaction . in case of drell - yan process",
    ", corresponding matrix elements were obtained from virey s calculation for dis by crossing @xcite .",
    "a weighted mean method is applied in order to extract spin asymmetries using `` unpolarized '' event generator pythia .",
    "a weight factor is calculated for each generated event , then its mean value of the weight factor distribution gives us the final spin asymmetries .",
    "first , partonic cross section @xmath5 can be obtained at a kinematics region by summing up the matrix elements for all the possible interactions . in order to estimate the hadronic spin asymmetries , we need hadronic cross sections @xmath6 with helicity @xmath7 selection",
    ". they can be obtained by combining with polarized quark distribution functions @xmath8 .",
    "for example , @xmath9 can be obtained as ; @xmath10 using the hadronic cross sections , we can estimate the weight factor in combinations between different spin selected hadronic cross sections . for single spin asymmetry @xmath11 and parity violating double spin asymmetry @xmath12 corresponding weight factors can be obtained by making the same cross section ratio in event - by - event .",
    "the distribution of the weight factor depends on the quark distribution functions , therefore , the process of making a mean value on these distribution implies an monte - carlo integration over the quark distribution functions .",
    "there are two free parameters in the matrix elements for the contact interaction .",
    "first one is the scale parameter @xmath2 and the second one is a sign of the interference between the standard model and the contact interaction .",
    "parity violating spin asymmetries are examined using pythia+polby . in pythia ,",
    "drell - yan events can be generated in single subprocess , which include the standard model @xmath13 exchange and also the contact interaction with its scale @xmath2 .",
    "[ dycs ] shows the results on drell - yan yield with selections of beam energies ( @xmath14 = 500 , 750 , 1000 gev ) and the scale @xmath2 . here ,",
    "gs - a polarized parton distribution function @xcite is used . at any beam energy ,",
    "excess from the standard model are observed when we require @xmath2 = 1 tev , however , the excess is negligible if @xmath15 2 tev . considering the percent - level systematic error in a cross section measurement , observation of",
    "the cross section excess is hopeless . in drell - yan process ,",
    "contribution from the pure contact interaction is very small because of its @xmath2 dependence of @xmath16 , on the other hand , the interference terms between the contact interaction and @xmath17 , @xmath18 have @xmath19 dependence .    on the other hand , a polarized experiment has a great advantage because of its systematic error cancellation .",
    "simulation results using pythia+polby on the parity violating single spin asymmetry @xmath20 are shown in fig .",
    "[ asymal ] .",
    "pure @xmath17 exchange and @xmath21 interference contribute on the parity violation on the standard model .",
    "we can see the large deviation from the standard model if we include the contact interaction .",
    "dominant contribution on the parity violation is the interference term between the contact interaction and the standard model . in fig.[asymal ] , we can see a clear deviation from the standard model even at @xmath2 = 5 tev , however , the experimental statistical error have to be also large . because of its relatively small cross section , required integrated luminosity is large as shown in fig.[lumidy ] .",
    "considering the rhic luminosity of 800 pb@xmath22 at @xmath23gev , our sensitivity is limited around @xmath24 tev , which is lower than the already established limits in @xmath25 collisions for the electron - quark contact interaction ( @xmath26 tev ) by aleph and in @xmath27 collisions for the muon - quark contact interaction ( @xmath28 tev ) by cdf @xcite .",
    "although drell - yan process is simple and clean , we need to examine other process , which has large production cross section because of the small yield on drell - yan process .",
    "parity violation in the inclusive jet production process has already examined by j .-",
    "m . virey theoretically @xcite .",
    "the jet production cross section is shown in fig.[jetcs ] as functions of jet @xmath29 .",
    "lower @xmath29 region is dominated by gluon - related processes , on the other hand , higher @xmath29 region is dominated by quark - quark scattering .",
    "the contact interaction couples to leptons and quarks , but not to gluons in the current model .",
    "it means that we do not think gluon is a composite particle .",
    "therefore , sensitive @xmath29 region of the contact interaction must be limited to the higher @xmath29 region . in case of drell - yan process ,",
    "all the interactions we need to consider , are the standard model @xmath13 , the contact interaction , and their interferences . on the other hand , we need to take into consideration qcd , @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath30 , the contact interaction , and their complex interference terms for the jet production . in pythia , above processes must be generated as independent subprocesses .",
    "this restriction cause severe problem when we consider the interference terms between different subprocesses in pythia .",
    "it is because there can not exist interference effects if we distinguish the subprocess . in case of drell - yan process",
    ", we can use single subprocess , therefore , the interference effects can be automatically included . in order to restore quantum mechanics in the jet production ,",
    "a special treatment is required . in polby",
    ", a hadronic spin asymmetry @xmath31 is estimated using event - by - event asymmetry weight factor @xmath32 ; @xmath33 here , the `` events '' are generated by pythia subprocess .",
    "the `` interference correction '' can be done by @xmath34 with eq.[wa ] . then if we use pure qcd subprocess for the pythia event generation , contribution from other processes on the asymmetry can be taken into account by summing up over all the processes .",
    "fig.[weight ] shows a sample distribution of @xmath32 before / after the interference correction of eq.[intcor ] .",
    "the mean value of the @xmath32 distribution shows the final hadronic spin asymmetry . by the operation eq.[intcor ] , @xmath32 distribution is distorted and we can get the corrected asymmetry from the distorted distribution . by using eq.[intcor ] , we can estimate accurate asymmetries . for an example , parity violation around jacobean peak",
    "is examined . in fig.[jetjacob ] , we can confirm the large contribution from the interference term on the parity violation around the jacobean peak .",
    "subprocess - separated plot in fig.[jetjacob ] shows that @xmath35 subprocess dominates the parity violation at the w peak .",
    "fig.[pvjetc ] shows a preliminary results , which can be compared with the theoretical calculation @xcite .",
    "considering the difference on the pseudo rapidity cut and binding , the results meets well with the calculation by virey . using these results , discovery potential at rhic",
    "can be explored . in fig.[lumijet ] , required integrated luminosities are plotted as functions of @xmath2 .",
    "here combined results from the present study at lower @xmath2 region and that from virey at higher @xmath2 region @xcite are shown .",
    "it is shown that we can reach more than 3 tev sensitivity , which is higher than the current limit of 2.7 tev reported by d0 for the quark - quark contact interaction , @xcite with the current rhic plan .",
    "it is also shown that the sensitivity limit can be more than 6 tev using the rhic upgrade plan .",
    "we can calculate many combinations of parity violating spin asymmetries using pythia+polby with many realistic experimental conditions . for the procedure using weighted mean",
    "can be understood as a kind of monte - carlo integration , the calculation speed is very fast .",
    "therefore this is a strong tool to examine an experimental sensitivity and also to make a standard model reference after getting experimental data .",
    "however , in order to use it as a standard model reference , nlo calculation is indispensable .",
    "nlo effect is difficult to take into an event generator .",
    "the situation is similar to the treatment of the interference .",
    "one large assumption for the interference correction is that , pure qcd process ( generated events ) and other processes must have their same final states . in principle , nlo correction using similar cross section correction like ; @xmath36 should be able to be applied .",
    "theoretical calculations in nlo are now under progress @xcite .",
    "we should and will be able to be ready to examine experimental data from rhic in near future .",
