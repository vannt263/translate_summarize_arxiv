    "during recent years the investigation of microfluidic systems has increasingly attracted attention , being boosted by its promising and powerful so - called `` lab - on - a - chip ''  @xcite applications .",
    "a standard task that such a device should be able to perform is the separation of small objects immersed in a fluid according to specific properties of these objects like size or form . for this purpose ,",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested .",
    "the proposed methods are either based on downsized conventional laboratory tools like tubes , pumps and valves , or they employ effects that only function in the microfluidic regime . in combination with particular geometric constraints  @xcite and various ways of external forcing such as by electric fields",
    "@xcite , thermal gradients @xcite or acoustic streaming induced by strong ultrasound waves @xcite , thermal fluctuations play a key - role in many of these separation techniques @xcite .    of great practical and principle interest",
    "are sorting methods that exclusively utilize inhomogeneities of flows in constrained geometries in combination with the omnipresent thermal noise .",
    "in particular , there are no external forces acting on the particle with these methods .",
    "the drift ratchet provides a typical example of this kind of device  @xcite .",
    "it consists of a large number of identical channels in a membrane , connecting two reservoirs both filled with water .",
    "the radius of each channel varies periodically in an asymmetric way .",
    "a carrier fluid , in most cases water , is periodically pumped to and fro . although no water is transported on average , particles immersed in the water in general move to one side with a non - vanishing average velocity .",
    "separation becomes possible because the particle velocity and even its direction depend on the size of the particle @xcite .",
    "as in conventional ratchets  @xcite the combined action of the periodic but asymmetric pore shape , breaking the left  right symmetry , the thermal fluctuations and the periodic pumping which drives the system out of thermal equilibrium are necessary ingredients for the observed effect  @xcite .",
    "the type of device studied in the present paper differs in several aspects from a drift ratchet .",
    "it does not require an oscillating flow , which is difficult to generate and maintain experimentally  @xcite , but operates with a stationary flow field .",
    "the flow is confined to a channel with variable width  as for a drift ratchet  but with ends connected to each other in some way , leading e.g. to a ring - like or `` figure eight '' geometry , cf.fig  [ f0 ] .",
    "spherical particles will then accumulate in particular regions of the channel . in a previous experimental work the figure eight geometry",
    "was realized to separate particles immersed in a fluid by means of electric fields  @xcite . in this experiment , a steady flow of the fluid",
    "was maintained by surface acoustic waves leading to acoustic streaming  @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we restrict our analysis to two spatial dimensions .",
    "the relevant mechanisms put forward in this work leading to an accumulation do not depend on the two - dimensional character and will work as well in three dimensions . in the experimental realization  @xcite the flow channels",
    "are bounded by a rigid substrate only at the bottom , the remaining boundary is a free interface between water and air .",
    "a reduction of this very situation to two dimensions is not obvious . to still include the effects of different types of boundaries in the two - dimensional model we consider two cases , one with two no - slip boundaries corresponding to two impenetrable walls confining the fluid and the other one with a no - slip and a perfect slip boundary .",
    "the latter boundary mimics a free boundary with dominant surface tension such that the flow only leads to a negligible deformation of the equilibrium shape .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : flow ]",
    "we introduce the flow field which is then used for transporting particles . in section",
    "[ sec : densities ] we analyze the hydrodynamic and random forces on the particles and formulate the long - time particle accumulation pattern in terms of a stationary fokker ",
    "planck equation .",
    "section  [ sec : effects ] makes a distinction between possible accumulations caused by a volume and a boundary effect . in pressure - driven channel flows only the latter may occur , which is then investigated numerically in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "we consider stationary incompressible flows in the limit of vanishing reynolds numbers .",
    "the velocity  @xmath0 and pressure  @xmath1 fields are solutions of the stationary stokes equations , @xmath2 where @xmath3  denotes the viscosity of the fluid and @xmath4  is a conservative externally applied body force which gives rise to the flow fields @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the velocity field is subject to the _ kinematic boundary condition _ ,",
    "i.e.  for immobile boundaries , @xmath5 representing the fact that all boundaries of the fluid domain  @xmath6 are material lines of the flow .",
    "@xmath7  denotes the normal vector . at immobile sticky walls ,",
    "also the velocity components parallel to the tangent vectors  @xmath8 vanish , @xmath9 for a free boundary , such as the interface between water and air , the tangential velocity at the boundary is determined by the mechanical stress balance . for the velocity field , this reduces to the _ perfect slip condition _",
    "@xmath10 in general , at a free boundary the shape of the interface between two fluids depends itself on , and reacts back to , the flow and pressure fields in the fluid . here we restrict ourselves to flows in a given domain on the boundaries of which the kinematic boundary condition ( [ eq : kinematic ] ) and either the no - slip ( [ eq : noslip ] ) or the perfect slip condition ( [ eq : slip ] ) hold . the full description of free fluid surfaces with surface tension can be found in references  @xcite . in the numerical examples in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] below , we will find that the type of the boundary condition has strong influence on the particle accumulation taking place near the boundary .",
    "the flow fields solving the stokes equations   and in combination with the boundary conditions and or are used to advect small spherical particles .",
    "if such a particle is a point - particle at position  @xmath11 , it can not be distinguished from the fluid material at this point .",
    "it is therefore transported with the velocity of the fluid itself , @xmath12 .",
    "the motion of an extended spherical particle with small but non - vanishing radius  @xmath13 about  @xmath11 , however , is qualitatively different from that of a point - particle .",
    "the force on such a particle is the integral of the fluidic stress over the particle s oriented surface , denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the viscous and the pressure contributions of the stress , respectively .",
    "an additional random force  @xmath16 takes thermal fluctuations into account . for a small particle of mass  @xmath17 ,",
    "the inertial force is negligible  @xcite , resulting in an overdamped motion , described by the langevin equation @xmath18 the pressure contribution  @xmath15 is obtained by expanding the pressure field in a taylor series around the particle center  @xmath19 and integrating over the particle surface  @xmath20 , @xmath21{\\hss$\\scriptstyle s_r({\\mathbf{x}})$\\hss } } p { \\mathbf{n}}\\,da    = -\\frac{4\\pi}{3 } r^3 { \\pmb\\nabla}p({\\mathbf{x } } )      -{\\mathcal{o}(r^5)}.\\ ] ] the viscous contribution  @xmath14 can not be readily obtained , since the particle alters the velocity field : it poses a spherical no - slip boundary to the surrounding fluid . in the stokes regime , in which the acceleration field of the fluid caused by the movement of the particle can be neglected",
    ", we may employ faxn s theorem of translational motion to describe this effect @xcite .",

    "still , it contains all perturbations caused by the particle , cf .",
    "appendix  [ appendix ] for the definition and ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "unfortunately , determining  @xmath22 is as elaborate as solving the full stationary problem in the presence of the particle . in the next section we can , however , make use of the fact that @xmath22  is a solenoidal vector field .    the third contribution to the force on a particle in eq .",
    ", i.e.  the fluctuating force  @xmath26 , reads at thermodynamic equilibrium  @xcite , @xmath27 with the noise strength @xmath28 , and @xmath29  being gaussian white noise , @xmath30 we neglect deviations from the equilibrium expression of the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem , which become relevant for large velocity gradients only , see refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein .",
    "further , we assume a dilute solution of particles such that hydrodynamic particle  particle interactions can be ignored in the langevin equation ( [ eq : langevin_overdamped ] ) .",
    "the overdamped langevin equation  , solved for the particle velocity is then equivalent to a fokker ",
    "planck equation for the probability density  @xmath31 of the particle centers , @xmath32 the diffusion constant is given by the sutherland ",
    "einstein relation @xmath33 and the drift velocity @xmath34  reads , combining and , @xmath35 the remaining term  @xmath36 comes from the taylor expansion in eq .  .",
    "the viscous terms containing the modified velocity field  @xmath22 are exact . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the long - time limit of the particle distribution , which is governed by the condition @xmath37 , leading to the stationary fokker ",
    "planck equation @xmath38",
    "as an _ accumulation _ of particles we refer to an inhomogeneous distribution of particles  @xmath39 .",
    "first , we note that the uniform distribution @xmath40 is a possible solution of the stationary fokker ",
    "planck equation   in case of a solenoidal drift field , @xmath41 @xcite . whether this solution is the physically realized one , depends only on the boundary conditions .",
    "deviations from a uniform stationary particle density are caused either by particular boundary conditions which impose a non - vanishing gradient of the particle density at the boundary , or a non - vanishing divergence of the vector field  @xmath42 .",
    "we refer to the former and the latter case as _ boundary effect _ and _ volume effect _ , respectively .",
    "the volume accumulation mechanism takes place for a drift velocity having a non - vanishing divergence , @xmath43 .",
    "the homogeneous distribution @xmath40 then is not a solution of equation  , irrespectively of any boundary condition . whether the drift field is solenoidal , depends on the shape of the particle .",
    "a particle of complicated shape generally gives rise to a drift field with non - vanishing divergence .",
    "examples can be found in the literature @xcite .    in the special case of a spherical particle ,",
    "however , the drift velocity @xmath44  is given by equation  .",
    "although the velocity field  @xmath45 is not known explicitly , it is known to be divergence - free .",
    "the same is true for its laplacian .",
    "only the pressure gradient may lead to a non - vanishing divergence of  @xmath42 . taking the divergence of eq .",
    "one obtains in leading order the laplacian of the pressure  @xmath46 , which can be determined by the stokes equation   to yield @xmath47 in a long modulated channel , where the flow is driven either by a pressure difference , by a constant force , or by an inflow velocity profile , the drift velocity  @xmath42 is indeed solenoidal . for these situations we state that all volume effects vanish exactly , and inhomogeneities in the particle density",
    "can only be caused by the boundaries .",
    "the boundary condition for the particle density in the fluid is given by the condition of vanishing normal particle flux , @xmath48 which guarantees that particles can not cross the boundary . in case of a vanishing normal drift velocity  @xmath49",
    "only the uniform distribution @xmath50 is allowed .",
    "vice versa , an inhomogeneous particle distribution can only emerge , if the normal drift at the boundary does not to vanish .    the velocity field @xmath22 , which is the leading - order term in the drift velocity  , satisfies the kinematic boundary condition   at the boundary of the fluid domain .",
    "as it does not provide a normal component , one might expect that neither a volume effect nor a boundary accumulation is achieved from the leading - order term in eq .",
    ". a close look on a spherical particle in the vicinity of a boundary , however , reveals that there is indeed such a normal component .",
    "relevant in faxn s theorem   is the modified velocity field  @xmath22 at the center of the particle , which can not touch the physical boundary but stays at least one  radius apart from it .",
    "the no - flux boundary condition   must therefore be imposed on an effective boundary  @xmath51 which has constant distance  @xmath13 from the physical boundary  @xmath6 of the fluid . both",
    "are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdstreamlines ] .",
    "neither the streamlines of the flow nor the field - lines of the particle drift velocity need to have a constant distance from the boundary . instead , some of the field - lines cross the boundary  @xmath51 of the region which is accessible to the particle centers . in fig .  [",
    "fig : bdstreamlines ] one of these crossing points is marked .",
    "there , the normal component of  @xmath44 is positive , i.e.pointing to the boundary whence leading to a deposition of particles at the boundary .",
    "accordingly , a negative normal component results in a depletion zone . both effects will be found in the numerical simulations below , see fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] .     and of the accessible region  @xmath52 for the particle center .",
    "their distance equals the particle radius  @xmath13 everywhere . at",
    "the boundary  @xmath53 the normal component of the drift velocity , and thus also of the drag force , are not zero .",
    "this is exemplified at the point marked by a cross . ]",
    "the given argument in the foregoing paragraph is a geometrical explanation for the leading - order terms of the hydrodynamic interaction between particle and wall .",
    "a general theory of hydrodynamic interactions in asymmetric geometries is presently not available .",
    "a known effect of the hydrodynamic interaction is a decrease of the fluid velocity induced by the presence of the particle . additionally , one obtains the saffman lift force  @xcite which drives the particle away from the boundary .",
    "the magnitude of this force is proportional to the squared particle radius and to the mismatch between the true particle velocity and the unperturbed fluid velocity .",
    "reference  @xcite provides explicit expressions for the correction terms from hydrodynamic interaction between particle and boundary .",
    "the force densities given there comprise a component , diverging at the effective boundary  @xmath51 , corresponding to the hard - core interaction .",
    "the next leading - order term in the particle radius @xmath13 is the random force , being proportional to  @xmath54 .",
    "the tangential force leading to the slowing down of the particle is proportional to  @xmath13 , and the saffman lift force scale as  @xmath55 .",
    "about the normal projection of the second - order terms in the drift velocity  @xmath42 , being proportional to @xmath55 in eq .",
    ", we can not say much . generally , they may give rise to a boundary effect .",
    "the magnitude of this effect , however , scales quadratically with the particle radius  @xmath13 and is therefore expected to be smaller than the hard - sphere boundary effect .",
    "furthermore , for pressure - driven flows in long channels , the pressure gradient at the boundary is oriented along the channel rather than normal to it .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a qualitative picture of the influence of the domain shape on the particle density . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we have to restrict the following numerical analysis to the leading - order terms of the forces .",
    "these are the geometrical interaction between particles and wall , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdstreamlines ] , and the random forces . by omitting terms which are quadratic in the particle radius",
    ", we may also replace the unknown velocity field  @xmath22 by the unperturbed velocity  @xmath24 .    using these simplifications ,",
    "the full interaction between particle and wall is replaced by a hard - core interaction preventing the particle from penetrating the wall .",
    "we are aware that this approximation may be quite crude for the quantitative description of a real particle in a real fluid .",
    "however , the analysis above shows that the only terms which lead to an accumulation are the normal forces on the particles in the vicinity of the boundary . in the hard - core model",
    ", this happens instantaneously as the particle touches the wall .",
    "the force is localized on the effective boundary  @xmath51 .",
    "corrections to the force , as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite smear out the force such that the particle is slowed down already in the vicinity of the wall .",
    "this will not alter the qualitative picture obtained here by the hard - core interaction . whether this approximation is really justifiable ,",
    "can be decided only by extensive numerical calculations of the hydrodynamic interactions , a task which is beyond the scope of the present study .",

    "[ fig : density ] for different boundary conditions of the velocity field , one finds the extremal values to be more pronounced in the case with a perfect - slip condition .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the slip condition allows a larger velocity at the boundary , giving rise also to a larger normal component , which then causes the accumulation effect .",

    ".      the two accumulation patterns in fig .  [ fig : density ] do not only differ with respect to their magnitude .",
    "so far , we have only looked at the inhomogeneity _ along _ the channel orientation , by stating that there are concentration and depletion zones in front of the bottleneck and behind , respectively . for a small channel as in experimental applications also the distance of the accumulation centers will be prohibitively small",

    "employing a perfect - slip boundary condition at the straight wall leads to a qualitatively different parameter dependence of the accumulation .",
    "[ fig : botslip_accum ] depicts the relative accumulation for the same driving parameters as fig .",
    "[ fig : noslip_accum ] .",

    "for that to happen the normal projection of the particle drift at the boundary must not vanish . otherwise , only the trivial uniform distribution of particles is achieved . in order to simplify the numerical calculations we employed a hard - core interaction model for the intricate interaction between a particle and a wall .",
    "both imply non - vanishing normal components of the drift velocity near the boundary , thus giving rise to a small accumulation effect , which scales with the particle radius .",
    "we compared no - slip and perfect - slip boundary conditions for the velocity fields in the channels .",
    "the latter is a simplification of the free - surface boundary condition which is realized in some experiments .",
    "we observed that the type of the boundary condition on the flow has severe implications on the resulting accumulation pattern of immersed particles .",
    "free surfaces generally caused larger accumulation effects showing also qualitatively different and interesting properties , such as an inversion of the accumulation direction , depending on the radius of the considered particle .",
    "this inversion might be put to beneficial use for a separation of particles of varying size .",

    "the following three velocity fields are relevant in faxn s theorem to express the motion of a spherical particle in an external velocity field : first , in absence of the particle , there is the unperturbed velocity field solving the stokes equations and  .",
