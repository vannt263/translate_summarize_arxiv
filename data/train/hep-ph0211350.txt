    "in these lectures we discuss experimental problems arising in the evaluation of the nucleon spin structure from data taken in high energy polarized lepton - nucleon scattering experiments . + a general introduction to the formalism of nucleon spin structure functions as well as",
    "their interpretation in terms of constituants can be found in recent textbooks on particle physics @xcite .",
    "only a short overview will be presented here in order to define the kinematic variables and to introduce the relevant physics parameters .",
    "spin structure functions are measured in experiments performed with incident electron or muon beams .",
    "these experiments are called `` inclusive '' because only the incident and scattered lepton are measured : @xmath0 the symbol @xmath1 represents the unmeasured hadron final state which generally consists of several particles .",
    "the kinematics of the reaction is entirely determined by 2 variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 which , in the lab system , are respectively the energy of the exchanged virtual photon and minus the square of its mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dis ] ) : @xmath4 in these lectures , we will consider only the region of deep inelastic scattering ( `` dis '' ) , where the mass of the hadron system @xmath1 is much larger than the proton mass .",
    "this condition is equivalent to requiring sufficiently large values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we also assume that the exchange of a virtual photon is the only process contributing significantly to the reaction , which means that weak interactions mediated by the exchange of a @xmath5 or @xmath6 gauge boson are negligeable . in practice , the latter condition is satisfied for all fixed target experiments",
    ". +    the mean feature of lepton scattering in the dis region is the * approximate scaling of the differential cross sections * : for sufficiently large values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the cross section only depends on the scaling variable defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the discovery of scaling in 1967 has given an experimental basis to the quark model .",
    "scaling means that , at fixed @xmath9 , the cross section does not depend on the value of @xmath3 or , in other words , on the size of the probed object . scaling",
    "therefore suggests that the scattering must take place on pointlike constituants ( `` partons '' ) of the nucleon . in the quark - parton model ,",
    "the scaling variable @xmath9 is equal to the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the quark which has absorbed the virtual photon .",
    "+ spin effects generate a difference between the cross sections for parallel and antiparallel orientations of the beam and target spins @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in order to discuss these effects",
    ", we introduce the * spin averaged cross section * @xmath12 which is measured in unpolarized experiments , and the * spin dependent cross section * @xmath13 which can only be measured in experiments where beam and target are both polarized . in the deep inelastic region ,",
    "the differential cross sections are expressed in terms of two * structure functions * which depend mainly on the scaling variable @xmath9 and , because scaling is only approximate , to a smaller extend on @xmath3 : @xmath14 the unpolarized structure functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 are related in the quark - parton model by the callan - gross relation @xmath17 and more generally by the relation is used in eqns.(8 - 11 ) to warn the reader that a kinematic factor close to 1.0 for @xmath18 has been neglected . ]",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 is found to be small .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of the structure functions ( `` scaling violation '' ) is due to interactions between nucleon constituants and is successfully described in the context of quantum chromodynamics ( `` qcd '' ) .",
    "+ the second structure function @xmath21 has been found to be small .",
    "for the longitudinal spin configuration which is discussed here , its contribution is further suppressed due to the small value of the coefficient @xmath22 and can safely be neglected .",
    "the * cross section asymmetry * defined by @xmath23 can then be written as @xmath24 where the coefficient @xmath25 is directly calculable from the kinematic factors @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 of eqn.(6 ) .",
    "the evaluation of the asymmetry @xmath29 , which is the main purpose of most experiments in polarized dis , gives access to the spin structure function @xmath30 using the spin averaged functions @xmath15 or @xmath16 known from unpolarized experiments .",
    "the remaining part of these lectures will describe the various steps involved in the derivation of @xmath29 from experimental data with special emphasis on some problems specific to muon experiments .",
    "+ at the constituant level , spin effects in dis can be intuitively understood by the fact that a quark having its spin projection along the reference axis ( + oz ) can absorb a virtual photon which has its spin projection along ( -oz ) and flip its spin , while no absorption can occur when the two spins in the initial state are oriented in the same direction .",
    "+ defining @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the distributions of quarks of flavor @xmath33 with spin along or opposite the nucleon spin , we see that the absorption cross section for virtual photons with spin projection opposite to the nucleon spin ( @xmath34 ) will be proportionnal to @xmath35 while the absorption cross section for virtual photons with spin parallel to the nucleon spin ( @xmath36 ) will be proportionnal to @xmath32 .",
    "the * virtual photon asymmetry * is obtained by summing over the quark flavors @xmath33 and multiplying each term by the square of the quark charge expressed in units of the electron charge @xmath37 : @xmath38 the denominator in the previous expression shows the well known decomposition of @xmath15 in terms of quark flavors .",
    "the numerator provides the corresponding decomposition of @xmath30 in terms of the quark spin distributions @xmath39 . comparing with the definition of @xmath29 given in eqn.(10 ) , we see that the factor @xmath25 can be considered as the depolarization of the virtual photon .",
    "this factor depends mainly on the fraction @xmath40 of the beam energy taken away by the virtual photon and is close to 1 for virtual photons carrying nearly the total energy of the incoming leptons .",
    "the first polarized dis experiments have been performed at slac in the early 80 s @xcite .",
    "experiments using polarized electron beams are presently running at jlab ( virginia ) in the energy range of 2 - 5 gev @xcite , at slac @xcite in the range of 10 - 50 gev and at desy at 27 gev @xcite .",
    "+ these experiments use high intensity beams ( e.g. @xmath41 electrons per second at slac ) and consequently need only relatively small targets to reach a high statistical accuracy .",
    "they can invert very frequently either the beam polarization ( jlab , slac ) or the target polarization ( desy ) and are therefore not very sensitive to systematic effects due to changes in detector acceptance .",
    "their kinematic range is however limited due to the relatively low incident energy .",
    "+ the muon experiments , mainly performed at cern , have opposite characteristics : their energy range is much higher ( 100 - 200 gev ) and their beam intensity much lower ( @xmath42 muons per second , i.e. down by a factor @xmath43 compared to slac ) .",
    "the incident muons are obtained from 2 body decays of @xmath44 s and @xmath45 s and are naturally polarized due to the non - conservation of parity in the weak decay . positively charged muons produced in a direction close to the primary hadron beam have a negative polarization of about 80 % @xcite .",
    "+ due to the limited intensity , muon experiments need large polarized targets .",
    "furthermore , in order to limit systematic effects due to acceptance variation , it is essential to use simultaneously 2 target cells with opposite polarization and to invert the polarization at regular intervals . the smc target @xcite which has been in use at cern since 1993 is shown as an exemple in fig .  [",
    "fig : fcryo ] and will be described in a further section .",
    "since the time interval between 2 consecutive reversals of the polarization is at least of the order of a few hours , the time dependence of detector acceptances becomes a critical issue in muon experiments . +      if we consider 2 consecutive runs with beam and target polarization parallel and antiparallel and with incident lepton fluxes @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , the numbers of collected interactions ( @xmath48 ) will be related to the cross sections ( 4 - 5 ) by the following formulas : @xmath49 here @xmath50 stands for the area density of target nucleons , @xmath26 for the acceptance , @xmath51 for the fraction of polarizable material in the target and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) for the beam ( target ) polarization . at first sight , it looks straightforward to extract @xmath54 from these relations .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the spin dependent term is about 1000 times smaller than the spin averaged one and that the large fluxes can not be determined with a precision better than a few percent .",
    "in practice , the uncertainty on the fluxes totally masks the spin contribution and makes a direct determination of @xmath54 impossible . as a consequence ,",
    "spin experiments do not measure cross sections but asymmetries .      as an example we now consider 2 target cells of same density @xmath50 with opposite polarization exposed to the same incident flux @xmath55 .",
    "+ under the unrealistic assumption that the spectrometer acceptance would be the same for the 2 cells , the counting rate asymmetry @xmath56 is obviously proportional to the cross section asymmetry defined by eqn.(9 ) : @xmath57 ( we will see in the next section how the different acceptances for 2 target cells should be taken into account . ) + the statistical error on @xmath58 @xmath59 reduces to @xmath60 when the asymmetry is small .",
    "a large statistics will thus be required to reach a significant precision on a small asymmetry .",
    "for instance , if @xmath61 , a relative precision @xmath62 corresponds to a @xmath63 interactions .",
    "+ the statistical error on the physics asymmetry @xmath29 is further divided by the product @xmath64 .",
    "it is thus essential to keep these 3 factors as large as possible : a reduction by a factor @xmath65 must indeed be compensated by increasing the number of interactions @xmath66 by @xmath67 . as a consequence , the * figure of merit * for the comparison of experiments performed with different beams or different targets is given by @xmath68    all published values of the spin structure function @xmath30 have been obtained from cross section asymmetries derived from counting rate asymmetries according to eqn.(14 ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath69 involves the use of parametrizations of the unpolarized structure functions @xmath16 and @xmath70 based on a large number of measurements from many experiments .",
    "the uncertainty due to these parametrizations is included in the systematic error on @xmath30 .",
    "the statistical error on @xmath30 is propagated from the statistical error on @xmath29 and tends to increase at low @xmath9 due to the presence of the factor @xmath9 in the denominator .",
    "this effect is well visible on the 3 data set shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcdprot ] .",
    "the difference between the @xmath30 values for experiment e143 with respect to the cern experiments reflects the @xmath3 dependence of the structure function : at any fixed @xmath9 , the average @xmath3 is about 6 times larger for the emc - smc data than for the e143 data .",
    "it can be observed that this difference in @xmath3 generates a sizable scaling violation in the region @xmath71 .",
    "the curves on the figure show that this effect is well described in fits based on perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "+      we now come to the realistic case where two target cells ( labelled `` @xmath72 '' ( up ) and `` @xmath22 '' ( down ) ) are exposed to incident fluxes @xmath55 and @xmath73 in 2 consecutive runs @xcite . in the first run ,",
    "the `` @xmath72 '' target polarization is opposite to the beam polarization while the `` @xmath22 '' target polarization is directed along the beam polarization . in the second run ,",
    "the polarizations of the 2 cells are reversed .",
    "defining @xmath74 , we obtain the following relations between numbers of events and cross sections : @xmath75 the counting rate asymmetries for the configurations before and after polarization reversal are @xmath76 @xmath77 eliminating the ratio @xmath78 between the 2 previous relations and defining the ratio of ratios of acceptance before and after reversal @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath80 which is a second order equation in @xmath29 . keeping the solution satisfying @xmath81 and approximating @xmath82 we obtain for the case where @xmath83 : @xmath84 under the condition that the ratio of acceptances for the 2 target cells remains unchanged after polarization reversal ( i.e. @xmath83 )",
    ", we thus obtain an unbiased estimate of the physics asymmetry by taking the arithmetic mean of the counting rate asymmetries before and after polarization reversal .",
    "+ the derivation is slightly more complicated when @xmath45 is different from 1 @xcite . in this case , since @xmath45 is nevertheless close to 1 , one may expand @xmath85 and drop all square terms multiplied by @xmath86 in eqn.(21 ) which leads to @xmath87 this in turn can be approximated by @xmath88 here the first term correspond to the result obtained for the case @xmath83 .",
    "the second term is a * false asymmetry due to the change of the acceptance ratio*. we also observe that even a small deviation of @xmath45 from the nominal value of 1 generates a sizable false asymmetry : in the case where @xmath89 , a value @xmath90 results in a false asymmetry of the same order as the physics asymmetry and spoils the data .",
    "it is thus essential to keep track of all changes in acceptances which may affect the value of @xmath45 and to eliminate data sets where the ratio of acceptances deviates significantly from its nominal value .",
    "the risk of such deviations obviously decreases when the frequency of polarization reversals increases .",
    "electron experiments where the polarization can be inverted for each accelerator pulse are practically unaffected by this false asymmetry while muon experiments need to reduce the time between consecutive polarization reversals to the minimum acceptable .",
    "solid polarized targets , such as the one described in @xcite , are based on the alignment of spins in a magnetic field @xmath91 . in paramagnetic materials , spins of free electrons",
    "align with the magnetic field which , at equilibrium , gives rise to a polarization @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the bohr magneton and @xmath94 the boltzmann constant . for a field of @xmath95 and a temperature of 0.5 @xmath45",
    ", this corresponds to a polarization of nearly 100 % .",
    "+ similar considerations apply to the proton spin but result , with the same field and temperature , into a polarization of only 0.5 % .",
    "it is thus essential to apply a process transfering the electron polarization to the protons in order to obtain an usable polarized target",
    ". + dynamic nuclear polarization ( `` dnp '' ) fulfills this requirement and can be understood at the most basic level by considering a system composed of a non - interacting proton and electron in a magnetic field .",
    "the 4 energy levels @xmath96 will be characterized by different projections of the electron spin ( first label ) or the proton spin ( second label ) on the direction of the magnetic field : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 corresponding respectively to the energy levels @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the difference @xmath105 for opposite orientations of the electron spin corresponds to a frequency @xmath106 ghz while the difference for nucleon spin orientations @xmath107 corresponds to @xmath108 mhz . at equilibrium ,",
    "the relative population is thus about 50 % for each of the 2 lowest levels while the 2 other ones are nearly empty .",
    "+ if a radio frequency @xmath109 is applied , a fraction @xmath110 of the population of level @xmath26 will be moved to level @xmath22 .",
    "this will be followed by a spontaneous transition from level @xmath22 to level @xmath27 due to the strong coupling of the electron spins with the field and result into a proton polarization @xmath111 .",
    "the opposite effect would be obtained by applying a radio frequency @xmath112 .",
    "+ dnp can only take place when several conditions are fulfilled : presence of the right amount of paramagnetic centers in the material , a field strong enough to reach the appropriate separation of energy levels and a temperature low enough to keep the width of these levels small . under optimal conditions , values of the proton polarization comparable to the electron polarization",
    "can be reached .",
    "[ fig : builtup ] shows the polarization build - up for the various materials used in the smc experiment @xcite .",
    "about 10 hours are needed before the polarization becomes close to its maximum level . changing the polarization by changing",
    "the radio - frequency is thus a time consuming process which can only take place during a long interuption of the data taking .",
    "more frequent polarization reversals are obtained by the so - called `` field rotation '' : the polarization is maintained by a transverse field of 0.5 t produced by a dipole coil ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fcryo ] ) while the solenoid field is ramped down and brought back in the opposite direction in a process requiring less than half an hour .",
    "the difference of the spin structure functions @xmath30 for the proton and the neutron is one of the key issues in polarized dis @xcite .",
    "while proton data are obtained directly from hydrogen targets , neutron data must be extracted from data taken on a deuterium or helium target . in this section",
    ", we will discuss several problems related to the use of polarized deuterium as an effective neutron target .",
    "since the deuteron has spin one , 3 states with spin projections + 1 , 0 and -1 on the reference axis have to be considered .",
    "the * vector polarization * @xmath113 is defined as the difference between the number of deuterons with spin projections + 1 and -1 by the total : @xmath114 the number of interactions in 2 target cells ( `` @xmath72 '' and `` @xmath22 '' ) with polarization anti - parallel and parallel to the beam polarization will be given by @xmath115 for simplicity we assume here @xmath116 , so that the counting rate asymmetry @xmath117 becomes @xmath118 if in addition we assume that the * tensor asymmetry * is zero , the 3 spin cross sections are related by @xmath119 and the counting rate asymmetry reduces to @xmath120 i.e. to the same relation as for spin 1/2 particles .",
    "the formalism developped in the previous sections for the proton remains thus fully applicable to the deuteron , with the only restriction that the polarization ( eqn.27 ) is defined in a different way .",
    "this different definition explains the lower values reached in the build - up of the deuterated butanol polarization as shown by curve ( c ) on fig .",
    "[ fig : builtup ] .",
    "when the deuteron is in a s state , it is obvious that the proton and the neutron spin are aligned with the deuteron spin , i.e. both nucleon spin projections are + 1/2 when the deuteron spin projection is + 1 .",
    "the situation is more complicated when the deuteron is in d state , since the l = 2 angular momentum has to be combined with the nucleon spins @xcite . as an example , the deuteron state @xmath121 is obtained from the following combination of orbital momentum @xmath122 and total nucleon spin @xmath123 : @xmath124 there is thus a probability of 3/5 to have both nucleon spins opposed to the deuteron spin , a probability of 3/10 to have one of the nucleon spins aligned with the deuteron spin and the other one in the opposite direction and a probability of 1/10 to have the 2 nucleon spins aligned with the deuteron spin . in total , when the deuteron is in d state , the probability to have one of the nucleon spins opposed to the deuteron spin is 0.75 .",
    "the d state probability itself @xmath125 is of the order of 6 % in all models of the deuteron .",
    "+ defining an `` average nucleon @xmath126 '' with @xmath127 , we obtain the following relation between the deuteron and nucleon spin cross sections : @xmath128 the difference between these 2 relations yields @xmath129      the deuteron spin asymmetry @xmath130 can be split into a proton and a neutron term : @xmath131.\\ ] ] replacing the ratios of cross sections by the corresponding ratios of @xmath16 s and taking out the virtual photon depolarization factor one obtains : @xmath132 which is the basic relation to extract neutron asymmetries from deuteron data and from previously measured proton asymmetries . the ratio @xmath133 has been measured with great precision in several unpolarized experiments @xcite and decreases rapidly for @xmath134 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f2np_e665 ] ) .    as a consequence , deuteron data at larger @xmath9",
    "give relatively little information about the neutron asymmetry .",
    "it is only at very low @xmath9 ( @xmath135 ) that @xmath136 can be considered in first approximation as the average of the proton and neutron asymmetries .",
    "the fraction of `` useful '' ( polarizable ) material in a polarized target can be evaluated in very first approximation by the ratio of the number of polarizable nucleons to the total number : 3/17 for @xmath137 , 10/74 for butanol ( @xmath138 ) , 20/84 for deuterated butanol ( @xmath139 ) and 4/8 for deuterated lithium ( @xmath140 ) when @xmath141 is considered as ( @xmath142 ) . however , a much more detailed evaluation is needed for 2 reasons :    * * all elements * of the target have to be taken into account , including impurities in the target material , target windows , cooling mixture and coils used for the measurement of the polarization if they are embedded in the material ; * * the number of nucleons * in the ratios must be weighted by the respective cross sections .",
    "we will only discuss here the second point , which has some general implications related to lepton - nucleon interactions and will assume , for clarity , that we are dealing with a proton target ( `` @xmath91 '' ) .",
    "+ in general , the dilution factor is defined as @xmath143 where the index `` @xmath144 '' refers to total cross sections ( including radiative effects ) . in this formula , @xmath145 is the total number of nucleons ( for the full target ) in nuclei with atomic number @xmath146 and @xmath147 the unpolarized cross section * per nucleon * on nucleus @xmath148 .",
    "+ weighting by cross sections is essential because the cross section on a nucleon bound in a nucleus differs from the cross section on a free nucleon .",

    "in particular it provides little discrimination between quark flavors and no discrimination at all between quarks and antiquarks .",
    "+ additional information can be obtained by studying semi - inclusive reactions , i.e. by requiring the presence of a given hadron in the final state .",
    "this can only be achieved in an experiment providing particle identification .",
    "detailed studies of semi - inclusive polarized scattering are presently under way in the hermes experiment .",
    "+ the gluon spin distribution @xmath192 contributes to @xmath30 only by the @xmath3 evolution and is therefore poorly constrained by inclusive measurements .",
    "a more direct determination of @xmath192 can be achieved by selecting final states mainly poduced by the interaction of a gluon with the exchanged virtual photon .",
    "this is the case in particular for the production of charmed quarks ( @xmath193 ) , a process presently studied by the compass experiment at cern @xcite .",
    "+ in addition to @xmath30 , another structure function , the so - called transversity distribution , can be measured in reactions where the polarization of the target nucleons is perpendicular to the beam polarization @xcite .",
    "this function is related to the transverse spin distribution of the quarks in the same way as @xmath30 is related to their longitudinal spin distribution .",
    "transversity will also be measured by the hermes and compass experiments .",
    "+ the possibility to extend the kinematic domain of polarized dis scattering has been investigated by different study groups over the last five years .",
    "projects have been developped for a polarized proton ring at hera @xcite and for an electron - ion collider at bnl @xcite . in both projects ,",
    "the lower limit of @xmath9 would be considerably reduced and negative values of @xmath188 would become observable if the presently used extrapolation is correct .",
