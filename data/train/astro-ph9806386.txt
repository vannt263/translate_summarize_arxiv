    "clusters of galaxies generally display diffuse x - ray emission at kev energies , spatially extended on scales up to several mpc .",
    "this radiation is a consequence of thermal bremsstrahlung from the hot , diffuse intracluster medium ( icm ) associated with the cluster , which is typically found to have temperatures @xmath5  k and densities @xmath6  @xmath7 ( e.g. , ) . a fundamental question in the study of icm physics concerns the amount of cooler material , if any , that may be present in the icm , and the physical processes that would correspond to sinks or sources of such cool gas .",
    "such processes include removal of gas from galaxies through ram - pressure stripping or collisions , ejection of material into the icm from star formation and galaxy activity , accretion of primordial clouds and proto - galaxies by the cluster , and large - scale icm cooling flows and  / or heating processes (; ; ; ; ) .",
    "there have been unsuccessful searches by several groups for direct evidence of cooler atomic and molecular gas that may be generally distributed throughout the icm (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "upper limits are typically in the range @xmath8  @xmath3 , @xmath9  @xmath3 , and @xmath10  @xmath11 @xcite , and generally apply to the central @xmath12  kpc of clusters . some indirect evidence for the presence of cool gas in the icm has been inferred in a few clusters based on possible detections of far - ir emission from dust (; , )  the short sputtering times of dust in hot gas would require shielding by atomic  / molecular gas in order for it to survive (; ; ; ) . however , in these clusters no direct evidence of cool gas ( e.g. , optical  / uv absorption lines ) has yet been detected . in a small number of other clusters ,",
    "atomic / molecular gas has indeed been observed ( e.g. , ; ; ) , but in each case it appears to be directly associated with the central cluster galaxy and not generally distributed throughout the icm .",
    "one locus of parameter space where cooler gas phases have been observed for many years is in the central regions ( @xmath13  kpc ) of cooling flow clusters ( e.g. , , ; ) , where the icm densities and pressures are sufficiently high that cooling should occur on timescales much shorter than the cluster lifetime .",
    "large amounts of cold gas have been inferred from detections of excess soft x - ray absorption towards some of these clusters (; ) . optical emission lines from @xmath14  k gas",
    "are also seen in their central regions ( e.g. , ) , together with direct evidence of dust ( e.g. , ; ) and atomic and molecular gas ( ) .",
    "however , the amounts of colder gas detected in the optical or radio are too small to account for the total mass expected to have cooled over a hubble time , and are also incompatible with the high x - ray absorption column densities .",
    "thus , very little is known about the possible existence , total amount , and physical state of cooler material in the more diffuse icm that is found in the majority of clusters , which do not specifically exhibit cooling flows but which nevertheless might possess a cool phase .",
    "for example , the extreme uv emission recently detected toward some clusters ( , b ; ) may indicate the presence of a cooler phase with @xmath15  k ( although another probable origin for this emission may be inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background radiation by cosmic - ray electrons in the icm ; ) .",
    "uv absorption line studies provide several unique advantages in carrying out independent searches for cooler material .",
    "first , they are extremely sensitive ; columns of gas as small as @xmath16  @xmath3 can be detected .",
    "second , several physical states of gas at temperatures @xmath17  k produce uv absorption line features .",
    "these include ionized , atomic , and molecular gas .",
    "the presence of dust can also be inferred from uv spectra , both through strong reddening and by the 2200    dust feature .",
    "third , if cold material is detected , its physical state can be determined by comparing absorption lines from different ions , atoms , and molecules .",
    "finally , the relatively high spectral resolution available in the uv means that the kinematic properties of any detected cool material can be investigated in detail .",

    "the cluster abell  1030 is ideal .",
    "the central dominant galaxy of this richness  0 cluster contains the uv and x - ray bright quasar b2  1028 + 313 ( , ; ; ) .",
    "its relative proximity ( @xmath23 , ) and high uv flux makes it one of the brightest known uv sources located in a cluster of galaxies , therefore ideal for obtaining strong constraints on uv line absorption .",
    "in this paper we present high - resolution ultraviolet spectra of b2  1028 + 313 , obtained during 1996 with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) and the goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "we observed b2  1028 + 313 with three high - dispersion gratings g190h , g270h , and g400h using the fos / rd camera , and with the low - dispersion g140l grating on the ghrs using the digicon-1 detector .",
    "further details of the individual exposures are presented in table  [ tab : hst_obs_log ] .",
    "all the fos observations were taken in the standard 512-diode fos spectrophotometric observing mode accum , sampling each diode with nxsteps@xmath244 pixels and with a total number of overscan steps set to overscan@xmath245 .",
    "the ghrs spectra were obtained in accum mode with fp - split = none and step - patt@xmath245 , thus sampling each of the 500 science diodes with 4 pixels .",
    "recalibration of the data was performed using the iraf / stsdas pipeline processing software for the hst / fos and ghrs instruments , using updated calibration reference files where applicable .",
    "specifically , a substantial amount of effort was spent on ensuring the accuracy of the fos flat - field corrections , both through the use of new `` superflat '' fos calibration spectra and related files created by the fos science team in 1997 , as well as by comparing residuals from calibrations performed with different flat - fields obtained around the same epochs as the observations .",
    "the resulting flat - field calibration represents a substantial improvement over the initial hst data calibration products .",
    "the absolute zero points of the wavelength scales produced by the calibration software also differ slightly for each of our various fos and ghrs spectra , owing to a number of fundamental uncertainties in the observations ( for example , filter - grating wheel positioning offsets ) .",
    "we have addressed this by placing the spectra onto a common wavelength scale defined such that all the singly ionized , strong galactic ism absorption lines have a zero mean redshift ( similar to the method employed in the the hst quasar absorption line key project , described in ) .",
    "this technique has the advantage that the effects of net velocity shifts of the galactic ism towards a  1030 can be easily applied to our data in future studies if required , although such effects would be well outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "the final combined set of observations yields a spectrum with continuous wavelength coverage from @xmath25    @xmath26  4780   .",
    "in figure  1 we present the calibrated hst data from all the gratings , together with two optical spectra obtained by m. ledlow at the apache point observatory ( apo ) ( see for details of the apo observations and reduction procedures ) ; these data have not been smoothed or rebinned .",
    "we present a composite spectrum of the quasar in figure  [ fig : spectrum2 ] , in which the hst spectra have been rebinned to dispersions @xmath27   / channel , in order to match the ground - based optical spectral resolution and better display the general spectral properties of the quasar .",
    "the overall quasar spectrum is similar to those of other low - redshift quasars , displaying the broad permitted emission lines of ly@xmath4 , c  iv , mg  ii and the balmer series , together with narrow forbidden lines such as [ ne  v ]  @xmath283426 , [ o  ii ]  @xmath283727 and [ o  iii ]  @xmath294959 , 5007 .",
    "the spectrum shows a strong upturn in the blue , consistent with the power - law ultraviolet increases generally observed in quasar spectra ( e.g. , ; ) .",
    "we note the presence of strong geocoronal ly@xmath4  emission at @xmath30   , which together with galactic ly@xmath4  absorption conspire to prevent any reliable measurements of o  vi  @xmath291032 , 1038 absorption at the redshift of abell  1030 .",
    "we used the iraf / stsdas 1dfit package to fit the unabsorbed background `` continuum '' ( thus including the broad quasar emission lines ) using a series of spline curves , following similar procedures to those outlined for the hst quasar absorption line key project ( e.g. , ; ) .",
    "the resulting continuum fits are shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum1 ] , overlaid on the hst data .",
    "these continuum fits were then used to normalize the spectra , together with the photon noise count - rate errors which are propagated through the hst pipeline reduction process along with the flux data .",
    "we first carried out an automatic , objective search for statistically significant absorption features in the spectra , using the same absorption - line identification software that has been used for the hst quasar absorption line key project , which was kindly made available for us by d. p. schneider ( private communication ) .",
    "the detailed algorithms and line - finding criteria are described fully in ; here we discuss the parameters directly relevant to the current dataset .",
    "the line spread functions ( lsfs ) corresponding to the gratings and apertures used in our fos and ghrs observations can be characterized approximately by gaussians with fwhm values as listed in table  [ tab : hst_obs_log ] .",
    "these values were used as input for the minimum feature width in the line - finding routine .",
    "all the candidate absorption features were fitted with single or , in the case of blends , multiple gaussian profiles .    in table  [ tab : detected_abs_lines ] we list the final sample of all the absorption features in the hst spectra that have a measured equivalent width @xmath31 greater than or equal to the 3  @xmath32 detection limit at the wavelength of the line center . we note that at this level , some fraction of the weakest detections might be spurious .",
    "table  [ tab : detected_abs_lines ] also gives the 1  @xmath32 uncertainty in the equivalent width @xmath33 , the significance level of each detection @xmath34 , and its measured fwhm value ( uncorrected for instrumental broadening ) .",
    "in most cases , a suggested identification is given , together with the redshift if the identified line is extragalactic .",
    "all plausible galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) absorption lines were first identified , and we confirmed each of these identifications through a detailed comparison with previously published ism absorption line studies ( e.g. , ; ; ) , as well as transition - strength data tabulated by and .",
    "the remaining lines were identified by assuming each in turn to be an intervening extragalactic ly@xmath4  line , and then searching among the other remaining lines for identifications with metal lines or higher - order lyman lines at the corresponding redshift .",
    "we identify a number of intervening ly@xmath4  absorption systems with typical equivalent widths in the range @xmath35   .",
    "we note that the two lines at 1251.76 and 1252.46    may at first be taken for high - velocity components of either the galactic s  ii  @xmath281250 or 1253 lines ; however , this is ruled out by the lack of such features in _ both _ s  ii lines ( which differ only by a factor of 2 in transition strength ) as well as in the other , stronger ism absorption lines .",
    "this therefore suggests that these are indeed two ly@xmath4  absorption systems , coincidentally associated in redshift space with one another and with the galactic s  ii absorption lines .",
    "similar identification coincidences have been previously reported in other objects , for example by .",
    "we also detect a possible absorption system associated with the quasar redshift , in ly@xmath4  and c  iv ( figure  [ fig : absn ] ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this system is presented in appendix  [ app : a ] , while in appendix  [ app : b ] we investigate whether or not the apparent c  iv associated absorption feature might instead be mimicked by kinematic substructure in the underlying quasar emission - line profile .",
    "our primary goal in the present work is to obtain the strongest possible constraints or detection limits on absorption from cold material that may exist within the icm of the cluster abell  1030 .",
    "the absorption - line identification software described in the previous section can provide some general constraints on the column densities of undetected species .",
    "however , these constraints are of limited sensitivity since they are based only on single absorption features .",
    "we have developed a powerful and robust technique that allows the limits on all the observable transitions of a given ionic species to be taken into account simultaneously , thereby yielding significantly stronger constraints on its total column density than the limits obtained from a single transition .",
    "we describe here the procedure used in our extensive search for absorption lines from ionized , atomic and molecular gas , which involves obtaining simultaneous constraints on all the observable transitions of each species . from the comprehensive sets of transition - strength and wavelength data tabulated by and , we selected all the observable transitions within the wavelength coverage of our hst spectra .",
    "we also investigated the possible presence of a number of molecular transitions commonly found in the galactic ism ( e.g. , ; ; ) .",
    "our data are of insufficient s / n to allow useful measurements to be obtained from detailed models of the molecular band - head complexes , thus we represent approximate upper limits on absorption from molecular species by the 3  @xmath32 equivalent width limits derived from the propagated count - rate errors at the relevant locations in the spectrum .",
    "each selected transition was described in terms of a single gaussian absorption profile ; these were all combined into a template spectrum that was constructed and fitted to the hst spectra by means of the iraf / stsdas specfit package @xcite .",
    "the wavelengths of all the transitions were set at fixed ratios relative to one another , thus the entire template was described by a single redshift parameter .",
    "the velocity widths of all the transitions were set to be the same ( i.e. , assuming that any absorption produced by the icm would display the same kinematic properties in different lines ) , thus the second parameter describing the template was the velocity dispersion of the absorbing system as a whole .",
    "since we are interested particularly in absorption from the icm , the velocity dispersions were constrained to lie in the range @xmath36  km  s@xmath37  ( after accounting for the instrumental profile ) .",
    "values much narrower than this would more likely be due to absorption from individual objects such as galaxies , while the upper limit of 1000  km  s@xmath37  corresponds to the largest plausible velocity dispersion for clusters of this richness class ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the redshift of the template was allowed to vary by @xmath38 times the maximum velocity dispersion ( i.e. , @xmath39  km  s@xmath37 ) relative to the systemic velocity of the quasar , allowing for the detection of possible high - velocity absorption components . finally , the equivalent widths of all transitions of a given species were fixed relative to the strongest transition , which in turn was allowed to vary freely for each species .",
    "the resulting template contained a total of 486 transitions , typically with about @xmath40 transitions for each ionic species .",
    "the specfit routine was then used to search the specified parameter space of redshift , linewidth and equivalent width values to fit all the transitions simultaneously , thereby providing an upper limit on the equivalent width of the strongest transition of each species .",
    "the use of large numbers of transitions for each species provides an extremely sensitive means of determining whether or not absorption from a given species is present in the data , particularly when combined with the limited number of free parameters .",
    "this method is therefore considerably more robust than using a single transition , and yields a definitive set of constraints on the maximum column density of each species .",
    "the final set of constraints from fitting the template to all the hst spectra are presented in table  [ tab : abs_limits ] , where we tabulate the 1  @xmath32 rest - frame equivalent width limit @xmath41 , together with the rest wavelength @xmath42 and oscillator strength @xmath43 of the strongest transition from each species covered by our spectra .",
    "the measured equivalent width limits are sufficiently low that the corresponding column densities would be on the linear part of the curve - of - growth for these lines , thus the column density limits @xmath44 are calculated for the limiting case of unsaturated absorption for each tabulated transition .",
    "we also note that these limits apply specifically to icm material , i.e. , populations of gas clouds with velocity dispersions in the range @xmath36  km  s@xmath37 , thus the possible detection of the narrower ly@xmath4  and c  iv associated absorption lines presented in table  [ tab : assoc_abs_lines ] is unrelated to the limits tabulated here .",
    "the limits presented in table  [ tab : abs_limits ] on the column densities of molecular , atomic and ionized species place severe restrictions upon the amount of line - of - sight material with temperatures @xmath15  k. these column density limits are applicable in a general sense to any scenario involving large populations of small clouds in the icm with a high velocity covering fraction ( i.e. , displaying a combined velocity profile similar to that of the hot icm phase ) .",
    "the possibility of significantly higher unobserved column densities can only be accommodated in geometries involving a very small number of cold clouds along the line - of - sight , widely separated in velocity space ; or small , very dense clouds with a small area covering factor , containing dust with high extinction .",
    "the latter scenario is ruled out in a1030 by the low observed reddening , while analyses carried out by and for other clusters suggest that x - ray heating should maintain cold gas at temperatures above @xmath45  k , which is inconsistent with observed radio wavelength molecular absorption limits @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that clouds of cool material may still be present in the cluster , but those along our line - of - sight to the quasar may be ionized by its radiation field and therefore would not be detectable via strong ly@xmath4  or molecular absorption .",
    "however , it is unlikely that large amounts of gas could be `` hidden '' in this way , since the expected line luminosity of such clouds at typical icm pressures and densities ( e.g. , ) would be @xmath46 orders of magnitude above the observed upper limit on the h@xmath47 emission measure ( e.m.(h@xmath48  pc  @xmath49 ) that is obtained by summing the relevant portion of the long - slit spectrum from .",
    "thus , it would appear likely that our limits apply generally to gas throughout the icm of this cluster , in which case we use the observed h  i column density upper limit to estimate a constraint on the fraction of neutral gas contributing to the total column density : @xmath50 , assuming that the column density of x - ray emitting gas is comparable to the values inferred for similar clusters ( e.g. , ) .",
    "this rules out the likelihood of a substantial two - phase medium existing in the icm ; instead , the most plausible scenario for the icm in this cluster is that it exists almost entirely in a hot single phase described by @xmath51  k.",
    "we have conducted a comprehensive search for uv absorption lines from a possible cool phase of gas that may be present in the icm of the cluster abell  1030 . the uv - bright quasar b2  1028 + 313 located at the center of this cluster provides an excellent opportunity to obtain stringent constraints on the existence of any cool component associated with the icm .",
    "the primary result from this study is a comprehensive set of upper limits of @xmath2  @xmath3 on the column densities of a wide variety of ionized , atomic and molecular species , thereby severely limiting the parameter space of any cool phase ( @xmath15  k ) that might possibly be distributed throughout the icm .",
    "we have also detected possible ly@xmath4  and c  iv absorption lines from an absorption system apparently associated with the quasar , with an h  i column density @xmath52  @xmath3 .",
    "the kinematic properties of this system suggest that it may be dynamically associated with the quasar host galaxy , and represents either a companion galaxy / tidal filaments , or otherwise originates in material within @xmath53  kpc from the agn .",
    "our upper limits on the column density of cool material in the icm apply in a general sense to any scenario involving large populations of small clouds in the icm with a high velocity covering fraction ( i.e. , displaying a combined velocity profile similar to that of the hot icm phase ) .",
    "the possibility of significantly higher unobserved column densities can only be accommodated in geometries involving very few clouds along the line of sight , associated with very cold material ( @xmath54  k ) , thus possessing very low velocity covering factors .",
    "otherwise , our results may apply generally to other diffuse ( non - cooling flow ) clusters : we find that the icm consists predominantly of a hot phase ( @xmath55  k ) , with cool material contributing to @xmath56 of the total column density , thus it is unlikely that significant amounts of the icm may exist in cooler phases .",

    ", the unabsorbed background ly@xmath4  emission level should be higher than our interpolated spline fit , and the observed absorption fwhm should be substantially narrower than the instrumental lsf since only the tip of the absorption is observed .",
    "this is indeed what we find  the measured fwhm values for both ly@xmath4  features are significantly below the 0.87    instrumental resolution .",
    "however , the lack of any further quantitative information on the weaker ly@xmath4  line precludes a more detailed consideration of its properties , and we limit ourselves to discussing the stronger ly@xmath4  and c  iv features .",
    "the column density of the ly@xmath4  absorption system is @xmath74  @xmath3 ( allowing for the possibility of a higher level of background ly@xmath4  emission ) .",
    "this is comparable to the lower end of the column density distribution for ly@xmath4-forest systems in the field ( e.g. , ; ) , which is of interest since this object is in a cluster environment .",
    "the relatively narrow linewidth of the absorption , compared with the expected velocity dispersion of the cluster gas , implies that it does not originate in a diffuse collection of cool clouds in the icm but rather in a spatially and dynamically coherent object , such as a galaxy or a gas filament .",
    "furthermore , since the systemic velocity of the absorption is so close to that of the quasar ( compared to the expected cluster velocity dispersion ) , it is probably sufficiently close to the quasar to be dynamically associated with it .",
    "one possible origin for the absorption system is a line - of - sight through an intervening cluster galaxy .",
    "the relatively small observed h  i column may be accounted for if such a galaxy is sufficiently close to the quasar that most of its ism is ionized as a result of the `` proximity effect '' , which would also account for the relatively strong c  iv absorption . using the observed spectral energy distribution of the quasar above @xmath75  ev (; ) , we estimate that an object with a total h column density of @xmath76  @xmath3 and a volume density 1  @xmath7 can remain ionized by the quasar up to distances of @xmath77  kpc , i.e. , sufficiently close to the quasar to also be consistent with a dynamical association .",
    "the low observed column densities may also be produced by tidal debris , which could correspond directly to the extended line - emitting region that has been observed around the quasar by .",
    "for example , typical gas filaments in such line - emitting regions ( spatial scales @xmath78  pc , volume filling factors @xmath79 ; e.g. , ; ) can readily produce the observed column densities .",
    "the relatively narrow observed linewidth ( @xmath80  km  s@xmath37 ) is also typical of those generally found in extended emission - line regions associated with luminous active galaxies .",
    "finally , the associated absorption could be directly related to material within @xmath81  kpc of the agn , where the ionization parameter should be sufficiently high to maintain the material at the required ionization state .",
    "such `` warm absorbers '' have been previously identified in a number of seyfert galaxies (; ; ; ; ) .",
    "their inferred h  i absorption column densities , together with those of more highly ionized species such as c  iv , n  v , and o  vi , tend to lie in the range @xmath82  @xmath3 ( e.g. , and references therein ) , which compares favorably with our observed ly@xmath4  and c  iv absorption column densities in abell  1030 .",
    "therefore this is an interesting possibility but difficult to quantify further with our current data , which do not allow good measurements to be obtained of either the n  v or o  vi absorption lines .",
    "a significant dip is evident in the center of the c  iv emission - line profile ; however , the identification of this as an associated c  iv absorption line is complicated by several factors .",
    "first , the emission line may have complex kinematic structures , which can mimic absorption .",
    "second , it is necessary to model both the c  iv emission and absorption features as doublets ( 1548.195 , 1550.770   ) , and the fact that the two emission lines are strongly blended by the kinematic structure needs to be taken explicitly into account when considering absorption in the profile .",
    "third , absorption should be seen in both the c  iv  @xmath291548 , 1550 absorption lines , with a ratio of transition strengths @xmath83 .",
    "the weaker absorption line is not obviously present in figure  [ fig : absn]b .",
    "the fit of the c  iv  @xmath291548 , 1550 doublet absorption lines is formally consistent with absorption ; i.e. , the @xmath84 value is satisfactory and is indeed decreased by including the absorption lines in the fit , but there is still a slight peak ( @xmath85-@xmath32 ) at the expected position of the weaker absorption line .    thus , there appear to be three possible explanations for the dip in the center of the c  iv emission line .",
    "first , the entire feature may be a statistical fluctuation , perhaps a combination of low - level instrumental effects and poisson statistics .",
    "we can not completely rule this out , but consider it quite unlikely .",
    "the dip is sampled by @xmath86 pixels and is a statistically significant deviation from even the most conservative interpolated `` unabsorbed '' profile , and also does not correspond to any known fos / rd g190h flat - field defect .",
    "second , the dip might be due to intrinsic structure in the emission line spectrum , either arising from kinematics or from the low - level presence of another species ( e.g. , fe  ii ) .",
    "we see no similar kinematics in the ly@xmath4  profile , but this merely shows that either ( 1 )  the ly@xmath4  and c  iv emitting regions are not co - incident in space , or ( 2 )  the putative ly@xmath4  and c  iv absorption is produced by material with different properties . if the spectrum in figure  [ fig : absn]b is due entirely to a complex emission line profile in c  iv and there is no absorption , then it should be possible to represent the data as a superposition of the two components of the c  iv doublet .",
    "we test this by using a deblending algorithm to separate the two components of the doublet .",
    "the total observed flux density @xmath87 at a velocity @xmath88 is simply the sum of the two transitions : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the intrinsic profile of the `` principal '' component having the highest transition strength ( 1548.195   ) , and @xmath91 is the ratio of the intensity of the secondary component ( 1550.770   ) relative to the principal component .",
    "provided that the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are known and @xmath94 , equation  ( [ eq : blend ] ) can be inverted iteratively to determine the intrinsic c  iv  @xmath281548 profile , @xmath90 , as : @xmath95 in practise we found that iterating to @xmath96 yielded a convergence of @xmath97 to @xmath98 , which is sufficient for these purposes .",
    "the primary assumption is that @xmath93 must be constant for all emitting gas at different velocities ( otherwise the two transition profiles would be different shapes ) .",
    "we can not constrain @xmath93 independently given our data , thus we assume that @xmath93 is fixed at 0.5 , which is correct if the gas is optically thin and not too dense .    in figure",
    "[ fig : civ - deblend]a we present the results of the deblending , carried out for a velocity range @xmath99 km  s@xmath37  about the quasar systemic velocity ( corresponding approximately to the spectral extent of the c  iv emission ) .",
    "the deblended profile is fairly complex , displaying a number of bumps and dips ( and similar results are found if the profile is smoothed slightly ) .",
    "however , when the two profiles are overlapped , their dips and bumps anti - correlate , for example at @xmath100  km  s@xmath37  where an emission peak in the primary component is required to offset a shifted dip in the secondary component .",
    "this suggests that the observed feature in the c  iv profile can not be modeled purely by emission - line structure but is intrinsic absorption , and that the other bumps and dips are higher - order `` ringing '' produced when the deblending algorithm attempts to fit an absorption feature as emission .",
    "finally , we consider explicitly the hypothesis that the c  iv dip indeed arises from an absorption system .",
    "one potential difficulty is that the c  iv  @xmath281550 absorption line is not obviously present in the spectrum .",
    "this may be due to an upward statistical fluctuation at that point  the deviation occurs only in 2 pixels , and at the @xmath101-@xmath32 level .",
    "another possibility is that the secondary absorption line is filled in by the secondary emission line .",
    "we have tested this idea by constructing model spectra containing both doublet emission and absorption lines .",
    "we find that , while the c  iv absorption line strength is partially reduced by the addition of a secondary emission line , this effect is too weak to entirely explain the observed spectra .",
    "another test of the absorption hypothesis is to examine the deblended profiles after correction for the c  iv absorption doublet in figure  [ fig : absn]b .",
    "these profiles are presented in figure  [ fig : civ - deblend]b and are somewhat smoother and less complex than those in figure  [ fig : civ - deblend]a , supporting the simpler hypothesis that the absorption is real and not due to complex emission - line kinematics .",
    "thus , we suggest that the c  iv feature represents genuine absorption , and we note that its characteristics are similar to those of other associated c  iv absorption systems .",
    "however , we caution that our current dataset does not allow us to rule out completely the possibility that it may be mimicked by kinematic substructure in the underlying emission .",
    "we have also found this deblending technique to be a powerful means of investigating the underlying profiles of components contributing to a blended observed profile , and recommend its use in studies of associated c  iv absorption systems or other cases where the contributing lines are strongly blended in velocity space .",
