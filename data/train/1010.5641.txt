    "in the last years there has been significant progress in the analysis and characterization of the dynamics of processes underlying the time series of complex dynamical systems @xcite .    if the temporal evolution of a quantity @xmath0 can be described by a langevin equation , it is possible to extract drift and diffusion functions of the underlying stochastic process from a given time series .",
    "this can be done because the moments of the conditional probability densities of @xmath1 can be related to these functions .    since this approach was introduced @xcite it has been successfully carried out in a broad range of fields .",
    "for example for data from financial markets @xcite , traffic flow @xcite , chaotic electrical circuits @xcite , human heart beat @xcite , climate indices @xcite , turbulent fluid dynamics @xcite , and for electroencephalographic data from epilepsy patients @xcite .",
    "real - world data , however , also give rise to some problems .",
    "one of them is , that experimental data are only given with a finite sampling rate .",
    "so methods had to be proposed to deal with the effects arising from this fact @xcite .",
    "another problem is the virtually unavoidable measurement noise @xcite . in the presence of measurement noise",
    "@xmath2 the values of @xmath0 or any of its probability densities are no longer accessible , but only @xmath3 and _ its _ density distributions .",
    "recently an approach has been presented which allows the estimation of drift and diffusion functions in the presence of strong delta - correlated , gaussian noise @xcite .",
    "starting with initial estimates for the noise strength and the drift and diffusion functions a functional of these unknowns is iteratively minimized .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce an alternative approach to the treatment of strong measurement noise .",
    "this approach is able to deal also with exponentially correlated , gaussian noise .",
    "the basic idea is , not to look at the conditional moments in the first place but at the joint probability density @xmath4 of pairs @xmath5 .",
    "if the measurement noise is independent of @xmath0 , then @xmath5 and @xmath6 are independent random variables and the joint probability density @xmath7 of their sum @xmath8 is given by the convolution of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the joint probability density of @xmath6 .",
    "the noise is assumed to be gaussian and the gauss function has some special properties with regard to convolution and fourier transform .",
    "this makes it possible to extract the noise parameters from the moments of @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore the abovementioned relation between the conditional moments and the unknown functions can be transformed into a relation in fourier space .",
    "this allows polynomial approximations of the drift and diffusion functions to be extracted using purely algebraic relations between quantities that can be calculated directly from a given , noisy time series .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : process ] is devoted to the noise - free stochastic process , the definition of its joint probability density and expressions for the moments of this density in terms of a taylor - it expansion .",
    "section [ sec : noise ] provides the properties of the measurement noise under consideration and in section [ sec : noisy_process ] expressions for the moments of a noisy process will be derived . in section [ sec : extracting noise ] these expressions will be used to extract the parameters of the measurement noise and in section [ sec : extracting coeffs ] to extract polynomial approximations for drift and diffusion functions .",
