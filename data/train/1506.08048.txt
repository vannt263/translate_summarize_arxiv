    "the predicted abundances for these elements depends only on one parameter , the baryon - to - photon density ratio .",
    "recently , planck data have determined the baryon density to excellent precision , leading to a primordial lithium abundance in the range @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this value is significantly larger than @xmath6 obtained for old metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath7 ) halo stars , whose distribution in the lithium abundance  metallicity diagram is almost flat , and defines the so  called  spite plateau  @xcite .",
    "these stars were long thought to share a common , primordial , li abundance .",
    "the discrepancy may be explained by diffusion and turbulent mixing in the stellar interiors @xcite , which corrodes the primordial li abundance , and/or by a non - standard bbn scenario @xcite . yet , another puzzle exists .",
    "the abundance of lithium observed in the upper envelope of young metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath8 @xmath9 ) stars traces a growth of the li abundance from the spite plateau value to the meteoritic value , @xmath10 @xcite and even higher , which clearly indicates that lithium enrichment mechanisms must occur on galactic scales .    in recent decades",
    "several potential li producers have been proposed on theoretical grounds . among the possible lithium farms in the galaxy ,",
    "the most plausible astrophysical sources are represented by asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite , novae @xcite and galactic cosmic ray spallation ( via fragmentation of material due to impact of accelerated protons , leading to expulsion of nucleons , @xcite ) .",
    "galactic chemical evolution models @xcite , show a convincing match with observations , when all lithium producers described above are included .    the main channel for thermonuclear production of lithium inside stars is based on a particular sequence of events , known as hot bottom burning and beryllium transport mechanism @xcite . at first",
    "there is formation of @xmath0be via the reaction @xmath11he @xmath12 , which requires large temperatures @xmath13 , and occurs in the deep interior of stars .",
    "outward convection mechanisms concurrently must transport the newly formed @xmath0be to external cooler regions , where @xmath14 . here , beryllium is able to capture electrons ( free and bound ) , giving rise to @xmath0li with the additional formation of 0.86 mev neutrinos .",
    "more recent computations @xcite suggest that a large abundance of @xmath0li can thus be achieved in agb stars , particularly with mass larger than @xmath15 .",
    "however , large lithium yields and , consequently , a significant enrichment in li of the surrounding interstellar medium , can be obtained from these sources only if extensive mass loss is associated with the phases of maximum li production @xcite .    in nova systems",
    "the abundance of lithium is related to the thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) scenario , which accounts for the physical explanation of @xmath0li and its ejection from the binary system . in tnrs",
    "the expanding gas reaches velocities of the order of 400 - 4000 km / s , which results in escape from the system , and enrichment of the interstellar medium with elements synthesized in the nova outburst @xcite .",
    "this scenario remains uncertain because of the lack of direct detection of @xmath0li during nova outburst , although its presence was proposed long ago @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath0li is easily destroyed by proton fusion at temperatures greater than @xmath16 , giving rise to two helium atoms . for",
    "this reason , @xmath0li detection in stars must focus on the external regions , where the temperature is sufficiently cool to allow non - depletion of @xmath0li .    in the literature there",
    "have been reported only upper limits to the abundance of @xmath0li in selected novae , e.g. , hr del , iv cep , and nq vul @xcite , while direct detections of lithium in symbiotic novae ( e.g. t crb , rs oph and v407 cyg ) are characterized by velocities of a few dozens km / s , which implies that lithium is not associated with the wd ejecta , but rather originates in the secondary giant star @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite have announced detection of @xmath0be features in the near - uv late spectra of v339 del ( nova delphini 2013 ) .",
    "indeed , the cameron - fowler mechanism is expected to occur during the tnr @xcite , leading to an over  production of beryllium at the epoch of the nova outburst , with a consequent decay to lithium after @xmath17 50 days .",

    "we report here the detection of @xmath0li i 6708  in the early ( first three weeks ) high - resolution spectra of the `` slow '' ( @xmath18 days , where @xmath19 corresponds to the time during which the nova declines by 2 magnitudes ) nova v1369 cen ( nova cen 2013 ) , when the nova was in the optically thick phase .",
    "optical high - resolution spectral observations started 4 days after the initial outburst .",
    "early spectral data were obtained on days 7 , 13 , and 21 with the fiber - fed extended range optical spectrograph ( feros - r @xmath17 48000 ) mounted on the mpg 2.2 m telescope located on la silla @xcite , and on days 4 , 11 , 16 , and 18 with the puc high echelle resolution optical spectrograph ( pucheros - r @xmath17 20000 ) mounted on the eso 0.5 m telescope located at the pontificia universidad catolica observatory in santiago @xcite .",

    "the presence of many absorption features in the range 3700 - 4600  in the first two weeks ( days 4 , 7 , 11 , and 13 ) complicates the identification of the most common transitions detected in the optically thick phase of novae , which are identified from their respective p",

    "we identify multiple expanding velocities for each transition : in the first week ( days 4 and 7 ) we measure from the balmer lines , o i 7773 - 7 , 8446  , and fe ii ( multiplet 42 ) lines two expanding systems with mean velocities of @xmath17 -550 and -1350 ( with a maximum value of -1400 ) km / s , while for na i we see only the system expanding at @xmath20 km / s . in the second week",

    "this procedure resulted in some non - identifications and degenerate - identifications , which we estimate to represent a small fraction ( less than 20@xmath31 ) of the entire dataset .",
    "a complete analysis will be published elsewhere ( izzo et al . in preparation ) .",
    "although from day 11 an additional expanding component is detected in the p - cygni profiles of the na i doublet , see right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : no1 ] , no further expanding components are identified for these heavy elements absorbing systems : the cross  correlation method provides a minor number of identifications considering a unique expanding velocity of @xmath17 1100 km / s .",
    "if we consider the presence of both expanding components for these heavy elements , the number of acceptable identifications for the higher velocity components is a small fraction @xmath32 of the identified lower velocity systems .    among the many narrow transitions , we have identified many low - ionization neutral elements transitions ( fe , ca , k ) , all belonging to the one expanding absorption system at the same velocity that observed in ionized heavy elements , with the only exception being na i d lines , which show additional expanding components from day 11 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : no1 ] . in particular , we note the clear presence of the resonance transitions of @xmath0li i 6708 , ca i 4227 , and k i 7699 , see fig .",

    "+      here below we discuss several plausible alternatives to our @xmath0li identification .",
    "we can exclude the possibility that this feature is due to a diffuse interstellar band ( dib  @xcite ) , because i ) no known dibs are located at 6695.6  ; ii ) all observed heavy elements narrow absorptions vanish after @xmath17 20 days from the initial outburst when the nova continuum is still bright and dibs should persist , being related to interstellar medium located in between the background exciting radiation and the observer ; iii ) we observe variations in the observed wavelengths of all these narrow absorptions , an effect that dibs do not show .",
    "an other possibility that must be considered is whether the 6695.6  absorption line is due to metal lines excited by resonance absorption of uv radiation which is absorbed in the iron curtain phase and then reprocessed at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "for example , each of the resonance transitions of li , ca , and k could be alternatively identified with a transition of fe or an s - process element at that wavelength , assuming that they are pumped by uv radiation ( either continuum or lines ) . particularly for the li i 6707.8  resonance doublet , a possible identification could be fe ii 6707.54  . in this case",
    "one should also expect absorption features from the same lower energy level configuration ( @xmath33 ) , and from the same term ( @xmath34 ) , which results in additional 2 other possible transitions ( fe ii 6769.27 , 6811.49  ) in the observed spectra .",
    "we have checked for 0.4  . ] their presence in the spectra of day 7 and day 13 , but we did not find any absorption feature corresponding to fe ii 6769.27 and 6811.49  .",
    "this evidence disfavours an uv - pumped origin for the absorption at 6695.6  , even if considering the coupling between the transitions and the ejecta velocity field .",
    "conversely , it supports our initial identification as expanding li i 6708  .",
    "we compare the red spectral region of nova cen with the same region observed in gw ori , a t tauri star characterized by the presence of lithium @xcite .",
    "gw ori was observed with feros and we have selected the observation of 26 november 2010 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : no3 ] we show the comparison of these two spectra , after correcting the nova spectrum for the expanding velocity of @xmath35 km / s .",
    "we clearly see the presence in the gw ori of broad ca i 6718  and li i 6708 giving more support to the identification of absorptions at 6695.6   and 6705.3  detected in v1369 , with li i 6708 and ca i 6718 .",
    "li i 6708  absorption line , as well ca i 6718  . the absorption in the nova spectrum around @xmath36 is identified as cr ii 6711.29 .,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "under the assumption that this absorption is @xmath0li , we have estimated its ejected mass following @xcite . since lithium , sodium and potassium are alkali metals with very similar grotrian diagrams and with respective resonant transitions , differing by only 0.25 ev for k - li and li - na , we can assume that resonance doublets form under similar conditions .",
    "this assumption implies that the ratio of their optical thickness @xmath37 is related to their abundance ratio multiplied by their respective @xmath38 ratio . following @xcite ( eq .",

    "we have obtained @xmath46 and @xmath47 on day 7 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 on day 13 .",
    "the lithium log overabundances are 4.8 and 3.9 with respect to sodium and potassium solar abundances @xcite .",
    "this result implies an overabundance of lithium in the nova ejecta of the order of @xmath50 , which is largely enough for explaining the galactic @xmath0li enrichment @xcite .",
    "the mass of sodium and potassium ejected in novae can be computed in terms of solar mass by using the results of different nova composition models , characterized by different wd masses , accretion rates and mixing degree @xcite .",
    "we have considered the results obtained for co nova models , where the mass of ejected sodium ranges from 3.4 @xmath51 10@xmath52 to 2.0 @xmath51 10@xmath53 the mass of ejected hydrogen , while the ejected potassium varies from 5.1 and 7.2 @xmath51 10@xmath54 . the hydrogen ejected mass can be estimated both from the intensity of h@xmath23 when the ejecta is completely optically thin , e.g. in late nebular phases @xcite , and also through the observed @xmath19 value @xcite .",
    "both methods converge toward the value of an ejected hydrogen mass of @xmath55 m@xmath4 . after combining the na and k ejecta measurements with the respective lithium mass abundance ratio",
    ", we obtain that the mass of lithium ejected by v1369 cen to be in the range @xmath56 0.3 - 4.8 @xmath57 m@xmath4 .",
    "the ratios li / na and li / k have been determined on day 7 an 13 when only a small amount of @xmath0be has decayed to @xmath0li .",
    "hence , the measured amount of @xmath0li may be only a lower limit . however , tnrs which produce @xmath0be could start even years or months ( see starrfield , iliadis and hix in @xcite ) before the nova was discovered .",
    "therefore the most plausible scenario for v1369 cen is the one in which tnrs started weeks / months before the optical detection , and therefore the measured abundance of lithium can be considered a good approximation of the total amount of lithium actually produced by the nova ( or a firm lower limit ) .",
    "the crucial quantity needed to compute the global li yield of the galactic nova population is the galactic nova rate , which is known within a factor two , @xmath58 = 2034 events / yr @xcite . with",
    "the yield obtained above , we derive for the lithium mass injected in the milky way by nova systems @xmath59 2 - 45 m@xmath4/gyr .",
    "however , it is well known that the ejecta of  slow  novae are more massive than ejecta of  fast  novae , by an order of magnitude , @xmath60 m@xmath4 vs. @xmath61 m@xmath4 @xcite , therefore fast novae , which can form @xmath17 30% of the nova population of the milky way @xcite , should contribute only marginally to the global @xmath62 yield . the above reported range of lithium mass decreases to @xmath63 m@xmath4/gyr , for a rate of  slow  novae of 15 - 24 events / year , in good agreement with the theoretical predictions @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : no4 ] it is shown the a(li ) vs. [ fe / h ] observed relation compared with galactic chemical evolution model results .",
    "the galactic chemical evolution model used is an updated version of the chemical evolution model of @xcite , that is based on the two - infall model of @xcite , and that includes agb stars @xcite , super - agb stars @xcite , galactic cosmic rays @xcite and novae , as li producers . in this model , the galactic inner halo and thick disc form by accretion of gas of primordial chemical composition on a short timescale ( @xmath64 gyr ) .",
    "the gas is efficiently turned into stars as long as its density is above a critical threshold , below which the star formation stops .",
    "the thin disc forms out of a second episode of infall of gas of mainly extragalactic origin on longer timescales ( 7 - 8 gyr in the solar neighborhood ) and with lower star formation efficiency .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the adopted mass assembly history is consistent with what is obtained for milky way - like galaxies in a full cosmological framework @xcite . the black continuous line in fig .",
    "[ fig : no4 ] is the best fit to the data obtained with a model with all li sources , starting from a primordial li abundance of @xmath65 and by assuming that each `` slow '' nova ( the adopted current slow novae rate is 17 events / yr ) ejects on an average @xmath2 2.55 @xmath3 m@xmath4 in agreement with the measurement of @xmath2 0.3 - 4.8 @xmath57 m@xmath4 presented in this paper .",
    "the black dashed line shows the predictions of the same model when a high primordial li abundance is adopted ( see the introduction ) .",
    "the red line is the best model with all li factories but novae : it is clearly seen that novae are necessary to explain the late rise from the plateau value .",
    "the grey area indicates the uncertainties in the model predictions due to uncertainties in both the estimated li yield from novae and the current slow nova rate : the upper ( lower ) boundary refers to the upper ( lower ) limit to the li yield estimated in this paper and a maximum ( minimum ) current slow nova rate of 24 ( 15 ) events / yr . the light green area similarly indicates the uncertainties in the model predictions when the maximum and minimum li yields from @xcite are assumed .",
    "though the two areas partly overlap , it is clearly seen that the theoretical nova yields tend to underproduce li in the galaxy , while the semi - empirical yields estimated in this paper give a better match with observed data points .",
