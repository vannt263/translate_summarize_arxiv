    "attempts to understand the complex deterministic motion of spatially extended nonlinear dissipative systems , so - called _ spatio - temporal chaos _ ( stc ) , are at the forefront of research in nonlinear dynamics@xcite .",
    "in contrast to simple chaotic systems in the time domain , in which a few important degrees of freedom are nonlinearly coupled , spatially - extended systems seem to require an infinite number of modes for their description .",
    "simple chaotic systems are typically described by a few amplitudes which are determined by coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations . extended systems , on the other hand , must be described by nonlinear _ partial _",
    "differential equations for which , in general , no natural reduction to a few modes is known .",
    "this extended form of chaos has been characterized to some extent for a variety of experiments and simulations , but continues to resist any understanding based on generalizations of the few - modes case . in this paper",
    ", we describe experiments on the spiral - defect - chaos ( sdc ) state@xcite in rayleigh - bnard convection@xcite ( rbc ) .",
    "rbc occurs beyond the first hydrodynamic instability of a thin horizontal fluid layer heated from below , and is particularly suitable for the study of complex pattern - formation phenomena because so much of the theoretical foundation has been established by the extensive stability analyses of busse and coworkers.@xcite    the sdc state consists of a disordered pattern of convection rolls , which prominently features the persistent spontaneous appearance and disappearance of rotating spiral defects .",
    "it offers an unusually controllable experimental system for the study of stc .",
    "other examples of stc which have been studied experimentally include for instance  dispersive chaos \" in binary fluid convection@xcite , chaotic regimes in electro - convection in nematic liquid crystals@xcite , chemical - reaction patterns@xcite , parametrically - excited surface waves@xcite , and rbc under rotation in the kppers - lortz unstable regime@xcite .",
    "most of these cases have the common feature that stc is encountered following the breakdown of an ordered pattern as a control parameter is increased . the onset of stc in such systems is typically linked to the appearance and proliferation of defects in an underlying pattern , leading to complex , persistent pattern dynamics . these patterns ,",
    "although disordered , still have a characteristic wavenumber and are far simpler than fully developed turbulence in which a broad spectrum of length scales is involved .",
    "usually , a crucial role is played by the size of the system , which must be large when measured in units of the characteristic size of the pattern elements . only in the limit of large system size , may one hope to approach the limit of a statistically homogeneous chaotic state that is free of boundary effects .",
    "rbc may be parameterized by four dimensionless numbers .",
    "the rayleigh number @xmath2 is a dimensionless temperature difference across the layer and is given by @xmath3 it has a critical value of @xmath4 for a laterally infinite layer at the onset of convection . here",
    "@xmath5 is the temperature difference , @xmath6 the layer thickness , @xmath7 the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath8 the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath9 the thermal diffusivity and @xmath10 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "it is convenient to define the reduced rayleigh number @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 corresponds to the onset of convection .",
    "this number may be regarded as the experimental control parameter .",
    "the prandtl number , given by @xmath13 , is a second parameter that describes the fluid properties .",
    "it has important effects on what secondary instabilities are expected in the pattern that is found above onset@xcite . in our experiments ,",
    "the working fluid was pressurized @xmath14 gas , for which @xmath15 .",
    "this value of @xmath16 is characteristic of gases . a prandtl number close to or less than one seems crucial for the appearance of sdc .",
    "the lateral extent of the convecting layer is described by the aspect ratio @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is taken to be the radius for a circular geometry .",
    "the sdc state is found only for @xmath19 .",
    "the lateral boundaries may also influence the pattern _ via _ roll - orienting effects which are not completely specified by @xmath20 alone .",
    "we shall show that these effects are unimportant to sdc , provided @xmath20 is sufficiently large .",
    "finally , the non - oberbeck - boussinsesq ( non - ob ) parameter@xcite @xmath21 , defined in the next section , characterizes the degree to which the fluid properties vary over the height of the layer .",
    "provided this parameter is small enough , as will be the case for the experimental conditions we consider here , the boussinesq approximation@xcite applies , and the pattern near onset consists essentially of rolls .",
    "sdc was first observed in gas convection using @xmath14 under non - ob conditions , that is when @xmath21 was not small.@xcite in this situation , the onset of convection is a transcritical bifurcation to a pattern of hexagonal flow cells@xcite .",
    "this pattern became unstable at @xmath22 to a roll pattern which , at higher @xmath1 , became the disordered time dependent sdc state .",
    "in later experiments@xcite , it was found that sdc persisted under ob conditions .",
    "these conditions can be achieved experimentally at higher gas pressures@xcite , or in thicker samples@xcite . in the experiments with circular cells discussed here , for which @xmath23",
    ", sdc begins to appear near @xmath24 and is well developed by @xmath25 .",
    "we found that this state is robust in the sense that it is found in both circular and square cells , independent of the temporal history of @xmath1 , and with various lateral boundary conditions .",
    "similar experiments have also identified this state in circular cells with both smaller@xcite and larger@xcite aspect ratios .",
    "sdc has been observed using several other pure gases with prandtl numbers near one , including sf@xmath26 @xcite , n@xmath27@xcite , and ar@xcite . in experiments near the critical point of sf@xmath26 , assenheimer and",
    "steinberg@xcite found that sdc evolves into a state of  target chaos \" as the prandtl number is increased .",
    "sdc also has been studied in experiments in which there is an additional control parameter , namely the rotation rate of the convection cell about a vertical axis@xcite .",
    "it also has been observed recently in various gas _",
    "mixtures_@xcite which have smaller prandtl numbers than pure gases .",
    "sdc has been found in several numerical simulations of convection patterns , as modelled by modified swift - hohenberg equations@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite were able to quantitatively reproduce the sdc state observed in our experiment@xcite by a galerkin truncation of the solutions to the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the apparently ubiquitous nature of sdc may seem at first to be in conflict with the well - known picture developed by busse and clever@xcite of the secondary instabilities available to straight convection rolls . however , their analysis tested the stability of _ straight roll _ solutions of the convection equations to arbitrary perturbations .",
    "the sdc state , which involves defects and strong roll curvature in an essential way , appears to correspond to a different attractor that coexists with that of straight rolls over a range of parameters .",
    "it is apparent from our experiments with square cells , discussed below , and from previous studies by croquette@xcite , that defect - free straight rolls represent a rather special situation that is extremely difficult to prepare in large-@xmath20 cells without special forcing schemes . with small - amplitude random initial conditions ,",
    "the sdc attractor is always found in simulations@xcite . in the experiment , random fluctuations@xcite which nucleate the growth of convection patterns , or",
    "the roll curvature induced by sidewalls in round cells or by defects and grain boundaries in square cells , invariably seem to put the system into the attractor basin of sdc .",
    "we remark that one of the outstanding problems in the study of stc is how to generalize the concept of  basin of attraction \" , which here can only be understood rather loosely in analogy with low - dimensional chaos . a direct comparison of the sdc state with the stability boundaries given by the busse - clever analysis has been presented previously@xcite .",
    "in the absence of a general framework for the understanding of stc , we fall back on statistical descriptions of the sdc state .",
    "there is however , every reason to believe that sdc is deterministic in the sense that the external noise driving the system is quite small@xcite and that the observed fluctuations represent the deterministic outcome of complex dynamics intrinsic to the system . in order to characterize the statistical structure of sdc , we made use of the space - time structure of the state , in the form of time series of snapshots of the pattern .",
    "we analyzed these using the three - dimensional structure factor @xmath0 , which we define to be the modulus squared of the fourier transform of the space - time shadowgraph data .",
    "many other sorts of analysis are possible , but this method has the virtue that the results may be interpreted in a nearly model - independent way to extract the global spatial and temporal scales of the dynamics .",
    "this is analogous to familiar and standard techniques for the study of disorder in materials by , for example , scattering experiments .",
    "a great deal of complexity is suppressed by this procedure , which amounts to a massive averaging over the chaotic fluctuations .",
    "the central and open problem of stc remains to understand this complexity by a more specific reduced description .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows ; in sec . [ experiment ] we describe the apparatus . in sec .",
    "[ sdcsection ] we describe in several subsections the phenomenology of spiral defect chaos , first qualitatively , and then quantitatively using the structure factor . in these sections",

    "[ discussion ] presents a discussion of sdc in the context of the general features expected of stc .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] is a short conclusion .",
    "the experimental apparatus was one of several of similar design that have been used in other experiments@xcite .",
    "a comprehensive description has been given@xcite ; here we describe only some essential features .",
    "the top surface of the convection cell was a circular 9.5 mm thick , optically flat sapphire window .",
    "the window was temperature controlled by circulating water held at the same pressure as the convecting gas .",
    "this avoided the deformation of the window that would result from a pressure differential across it , and made cells with an extremely uniform thickness possible .",
    "the residual distortion in the flatness of the sapphire , which was @xmath28 , was due to stress from its mechanical mounting .",
    "a pressure vessel enclosed the cell and a closed volume of water which was circulated over the top plate by a small pump .",
    "the temperature of the circulating water was fixed at @xmath29 and regulated by a computer controlled servo .",
    "the water pumped across the top sapphire could be regulated to @xmath30 .",
    "the bottom surface of the cell was an aluminum plate , 9.5 mm thick , which was diamond machined to @xmath28 surface flatness .",
    "the plate was heated by a commercial thin film heater which covered its entire bottom surface .",
    "its temperature was sensed by an embedded thermistor .",
    "the temperature of the plate , which was under the control of a computer servo similar to that used for the circulating water , was the main experimental control parameter .",
    "it varied between about @xmath31 and @xmath32 , measured to @xmath33 , and was regulated to @xmath30 .",
    "the position of the bottom plate was determined by an adjustable support which included three piezoelectric legs .",
    "these allowed adjustment of the cell thickness over a range of @xmath34 , and were used as a fine adjustment after the cell was pressurized .",
    "the height of the cell and its uniformity were measured interferometrically at the working pressure , as described in ref .",
    "the cell - height uniformity was typically @xmath35 m .",
    "the cell thickness could be determined to within @xmath36 m at a reference bottom plate temperature . as the bottom plate temperature was increased , the cell thickness changed , due primarily to the thermal expansion of the aluminum bottom plate .",
    "this expansion was about @xmath37 of @xmath6 at the highest bottom - plate temperatures .",
    "it was measured , and a correction was applied in the calculation of @xmath1 described below .",
    "the lateral sidewalls of the cell were defined by a porous gasket made of three sheets of filter paper .",
    "the relatively low thermal conductivity of the paper reduced temperature gradients caused by the tendency of the gasket to act as a thermal short circuit between the top and bottom plates .",
    "the effect of such gradients on patterns in circular cells at low @xmath1 is to stabilize cell filling spirals@xcite or concentric target patterns@xcite in which the rolls lie parallel to the sidewall .",
    "we constructed both circular and square cells using paper sidewalls for which the gradients were sufficiently small that the rolls lay perpendicular to the sidewalls except at very small @xmath1 . in order to study the effect of sidewall forcing",
    ", we embedded fine heater wires in the paper sidewall which were sufficient to restore strong parallel roll alignment near onset . in the circular cell , the sidewall heater extended around the entire circumference , while in the square cell there were heaters on two opposite edges .",
    "the circular cell was @xmath38 mm in radius and @xmath39 m high , giving an aspect ratio @xmath40 radius / height @xmath41 .",
    "the square cell was @xmath42 mm on each side and @xmath43 m high , so that the aspect ratio @xmath40 width / height @xmath44 . in both the round and the square cells ,",
    "the @xmath14 gas was held at a constant pressure of @xmath45 bar .",
    "the pressure was regulated to be constant to within @xmath46 by servo controlling a heater in a gas filled ballast volume connected to the cell .",
    "the convection patterns were imaged using the shadowgraph technique@xcite which maps the deviation of a parallel beam of light reflected off the mirrored bottom plate .",
    "the deviations are caused by the varying index of refraction of the gas due to the small lateral temperature differences across a convection roll . in these images ,",
    "the white areas correspond to cool downward flowing gas , while the dark areas are warm upflows . to make quantitative pattern measurements ,",
    "the shadowgraph was operated in a linear regime and the image was captured by a ccd video camera using a computer and an 8 bit frame grabber . dividing the image by a reference image taken below the onset of convection largely compensated for nonuniformities in the illumination .",
    "our quantitative results are based directly on these ratio images . for the purpose of visual presentation ,",
    "the ratio images were re - scaled so as to render them with increased contrast .",
    "values of the relevant dimensionless parameters were calculated from the known gas properties.@xcite the properties were evaluated at the average temperature @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the temperature at the top and bottom of the fluid layer respectively .",
    "the temperature @xmath49 was that measured by the thermistor embedded in the bottom plate .",
    "the temperature @xmath50 was slightly larger than that of the circulating water because of the finite thermal conductivity of the sapphire top plate , which was taken into account . at the onset of convection",
    "this difference was 0.06@xmath51c .",
    "we calculated the vertical thermal diffusion time scale @xmath52 as a function of @xmath53 and used it to rescale all the times in the experiment .",

    "this correction becomes relatively unimportant as @xmath79 becomes large . using this definition of @xmath1 , the control parameter dependence of @xmath54 in the circular cell",
    "is given approximately by @xmath80 , while the mean prandtl number was @xmath81 , and the vertical thermal diffusion time was @xmath82 . for our range of @xmath83 ,",
    "@xmath67 varied by 3% and @xmath68 by 10% due to the variation of @xmath53 .",
    "in this section , we describe the general features of the sdc state , and how they depend on some simple variations of the experimental conditions .",
    "mbca96figures [ patternsequence_ab ] and [ patternsequence_cd ] shows the sequence of patterns observed in a circular cell with the sidewall heater turned off . for small @xmath84 , as shown by fig .",
    "[ patternsequence_ab]a , the pattern consists of motionless straight rolls , with small grain boundaries around the circumference .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of schlter , lortz , and busse@xcite and the weak forcing nature of the paper sidewalls .",
    "as @xmath1 is increased , the tendency of the sidewalls to enforce a perpendicular roll orientation becomes more pronounced , eventually leading to the frustrated pattern shown by fig .",
    "[ patternsequence_ab]b at @xmath85 .",
    "these patterns typically show at least _ three _ focus singularities around their circumference and several slow - moving defects and grain boundaries in the interior .",
    "the foci often act as sources or sinks for rolls and dislocations@xcite .",
    "this state may be contrasted with the two - focus  pan - am \" pattern seen in smaller @xmath86 cells@xcite in this regime . at @xmath87 ,",
    "the first spiral defects are seen .",
    "these appear quite intermittently , and usually develop within highly defected regions near the center of the cell .",
    "the spirals exhibit a tendency to rotate and evolve on shorter time scales than the rest of the pattern .",
    "by @xmath88 , the nucleation of spiral defects is continuous , usually in the interior of the cell , and the highly defected sdc regions coexist with slow - moving focus singularities around the edge of the cell , as shown by the fig .",
    "[ patternsequence_cd]a .",
    "as @xmath1 is increased , the sdc state progressively invades the entire cell , as shown by fig .",
    "[ patternsequence_cd]b . even at the highest @xmath89",
    ", the rolls continue to meet the sidewall perpendicularly , creating a circumferential fringe of small focus defects as long as the sidewall heater is turned off .",
    "we may note several qualitative features of the sdc state , as it appears in the interior of the cell , away from boundary effects .",
    "first , we find that both right and left handed spirals appear , in roughly equal numbers , and are _ not _ created in pairs .",
    "in fact , the spiral cores are only the most visually striking defect in a pattern which contains many other defects including dislocations , grain boundaries _ etc .",
    "_ one - armed spirals are certainly the most common , but target patterns and two - armed spirals also appear occasionally .",
    "the processes by which spirals are created and destroyed are not simple in general , but some common scenarios have been described by assenheimer and steinberg@xcite .",
    "the rotation rate of the spirals is variable and difficult to estimate except in a few particularly long - lived examples . in cases where a sustained rotation is seen ,",
    "the spiral core rotates in a  winding - up \" sense , _",
    "i.e. _ so that with successive turns rolls move outward from the core .",
    "the bottom plate temperature could either be ramped slowly , or stepped rapidly .",
    "we are only concerned here with patterns which have reached a statistical steady state . in the absence of other information",
    ", a pattern transient may be expected to take at least several horizontal thermal diffusion times @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , over most of the range of @xmath1 we studied , the sdc state takes much less time than this to establish itself , requiring only a few hundred @xmath68 .",
    "this is apparently due to the surprisingly fast time scale of sdc , as we will make quantitative below .",
    "nevertheless , our experimental protocol was to step @xmath1 rapidly ( within @xmath91 ) to a target value , then to wait at least @xmath92 before collecting data .",
    "runs in which @xmath1 was ramped slowly , @xmath93 , produced similar patterns at low @xmath1 and a similar transition to sdc .    in order to examine the effect of changing the sidewall boundary conditions",
    ", we performed a few runs with the sidewall heater on .",
    "for small @xmath94 , the main effect is to convert straight roll and frustrated patterns similar to those of fig .",
    "[ patternsequence_ab ] to large cell - filling spirals , as shown in fig .",
    "[ roundcellheaterloweps ] .",
    "these large spirals were qualitatively similar to the rotating spirals observed previously@xcite . if the sidewall heater is turned off after a cell - filling spiral is established , it was found that the center of the spiral soon moves to one side and a frustrated pattern similar to that shown in the fig .",
    "[ patternsequence_ab]b develops after a long transient . at higher @xmath1 , with the sidewall heater on ,",
    "a similar sdc state is found , as shown in fig .",
    "[ roundcellheaterchaos ] . here",
    "sdc evolves in the interior of the cell , while at the perimeter the rolls lie parallel to the sidewalls and no small foci are present .",
    "we have not yet undertaken a detailed study of the transition between the large spiral states@xcite and sdc .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the onset of sdc in a circular cell with and without sidewall forcing , and in various aspect ratios , using the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to test the sensitivity of the sdc to the sidewall geometry , we examined the phenomenon in our square cell .",
    "figure [ sqcell ] shows the patterns observed .",
    "we attempted to use the sidewall heaters on opposite edges to prepare a state of straight rolls , but this proved to be impossible even for very slow ramping of @xmath1 through onset .",
    "this was apparently due to a very narrow range of hexagonal flow cells that appears just above onset , due to non - ob effects ; these tend to decay to roll patches that meet at @xmath95 , leading to persistent grain boundaries as in fig [ sqcell](a ) .",
    "we also tried deliberately breaking the symmetry by putting a large thickness ( and hence @xmath1 ) wedge across the cell from edge to edge , and by tilting the entire apparatus several degrees toward one edge .",
    "none of these methods were sufficient to prepare straight rolls .",
    "while this effort would probably be successful with a sufficiently drastic forcing scheme , it seems fair to say that defect - free straight rolls are practically inaccessible given the initial conditions and boundary conditions that were experimentally available in our cell .",
    "they have been successfully prepared in smaller aspect ratio rectangular cells using sidewall heaters , however@xcite . at higher @xmath96",
    ", we found the familiar sdc state in the square cell , regardless of the sidewall heating , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sqcell](b ) .",
    "the observation of sdc with and without sidewall forcing in circular cells , in cells of various @xmath97@xcite in sufficiently large square cells , and in navier - stokes simulations with periodic boundary conditions@xcite lends support to the conclusion that sdc is a generic state for low-@xmath67 and large-@xmath20 convection , which is not related to the detailed boundary conditions . in the next section ,",
    "we take up the quantitative characterization of sdc .",
    "this will show that the characteristic length scales in the sdc regime are much smaller than the size of the cell , as one expects for an  extensive \" chaotic state .      in this section",
    "we describe the statistical methodology we used to quantitatively characterize the sdc .",
    "a time series of two - dimensional shadowgraph snapshots is taken and may be regarded as a sample of three dimensional space - time .",
    "we presume that the states for which we take such series are statistically stationary .",
    "our basic tool is the structure factor @xmath98 which we determine experimentally by taking the modulus squared of the discrete fourier transform of the three - dimensional space - time data set . since phase information is destroyed by taking the modulus , this already represents an enormous simplification of the data .",
    "we further simplify the structure factor using certain windowing and averaging techniques described below , to extract a few global features of the motion , namely correlation lengths and times , as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this analysis leaves much to be desired and averages out a lot of the interesting details of the dynamics ; it has the virtue of simplicity and is almost completely free of _ ad hoc _ assumptions .",
    "two types of spacetime data were collected . in the first type",
    ", time series were taken with a long wait , typically several hundred @xmath68 , between images .",
    "this time step was chosen to be long compared to the typical timescale for pattern change , so that successive images were nearly uncorrelated .",
    "this type of data was used for obtaining long time averages of @xmath99 . a second type of time series consisted of images taken a few @xmath68 apart , so as to obtain temporal correlation information . in both cases ,",
    "each divided image was @xmath100 pixels with 8-bit greyscale resolution .",
    "one spacetime sample usually contained 256 such images .",
    "the size of the square image was such that its corners just met the edges of the round cell . in order to avoid including the pattern in the corners of the image , which is influenced by boundary effects , and to reduce the aliasing effect of the sharp edged picture , we prefiltered the images by multiplying them by a radial hanning function given by      @xmath102    the radius @xmath103 was @xmath104 in units of @xmath6 .",
    "a one - dimensional hanning window was also applied to the spacetime data in the time direction .",
    "the effect of each of these windows is to convolve the windowing function with the fourier transform in such a way that ringing due to the sharp boundaries of the dataset is suppressed .",
    "we consider the _ time averaged _ structure factor @xmath105 for the temporally uncorrelated spacetime data first@xcite .",
    "this could either be obtained by numerically integrating @xmath0 over @xmath106 , or more simply by time averaging the instantaneous spatial structure factors @xmath107at each time step .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the former .",
    "when sdc is well developed , @xmath105 shows a broad ring centered on @xmath108 .",
    "only data within an annular band near this ring were further analyzed ; we ignored , for example , a large spike near @xmath108 , which is due mostly to large scale nonuniformities of illumination .",
    "a diffuse positive background , presumably due to camera noise , pervades @xmath109-space , and underlies the ring .",
    "the shadowgraph was operated in as nearly linear a regime as possible , but at the highest @xmath1 , a trace of a second harmonic ring was detectable .",
    "this ring was either due to residual nonlinearity in the shadowgraph , or possibly higher order components within each roll of the flow pattern itself . in any case",
    ", only data near the primary ring were considered , and the very small tail due to the second harmonic was treated as part of the diffuse background .    in the vicinity of the onset of sdc , for @xmath110 , the ring in @xmath105 appears irregular or broken , while near the onset of convection it is reduced to two spots .",
    "for @xmath111 , where spirals appear continuously , @xmath105 was nearly azimuthally symmetric .",
    "et al._@xcite have shown that the uniformity of the power around the ring is a useful diagnostic for the appearance of spirals and hence of sdc .",
    "this is obviously due to the fact that spirals or targets naturally contain rolls of all orientations , while the frustrated patterns similar that in fig .",
    "[ patternsequence_ab]b usually contain a dominant roll orientation .",
    "more precisely , nonuniform @xmath109-space rings result when the slow roll rearrangements in the frustrated patterns have insufficient time to sample all roll orientations within the averaging time of the dataset .",
    "once the quickly - evolving spirals begin to reliably appear , the ring fills in over relatively short averaging times .",
    "the inverse width of the ring is a quantitative measure of the length scale of the patches of rolls in the pattern .",
    "we performed an azimuthal average in @xmath109-space to obtain the azimuthally and time averaged structure factor @xmath112 , where @xmath113 . using the average wavenumber @xmath114 from this distribution , defined by @xmath115 we define the moments @xmath116 of @xmath117 about @xmath114 as @xmath118 = \\biggl[{{{\\int_0^{\\infty } } ( k-\\langle k \\rangle)^n k{s}({k}){dk}}\\over { { \\int_0^{\\infty}}{k } { s}({k } ) { dk}}}\\biggr]\\ .\\label{moments}\\ ] ] the correlation length @xmath119 is calculated from the second moment via @xmath120    the values of higher moments extracted from data are very sensitive to noise in the wings of @xmath112 .",
