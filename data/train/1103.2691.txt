    "adaptive coding techniques are frequently employed , especially in wireless communications , in order to dynamically adjust the coding rate to changing channel conditions .",
    "an example of adaptive coding technique consists in puncturing a mother code . when the channel conditions are good more bits are punctured and the coding rate is increased . in poor channel conditions",
    "all redundant bits are transmitted and the coding rate drops . however , in harsh conditions , the receiver might not be able to successfully decode the received signal , even if all the redundant bits have been transmitted .",
    "in such a case , the coded block can be retransmitted until the sent information is successfully decoded .",
    "this is equivalent to additional repetition coding , which further lowers the coding rate below the mother coding rate .",
    "however , the use of retransmission techniques might not be suitable nor possible in some situations , such as multicast / broadcast transmissions , or whenever the return link is strictly limited or not available ( such situations are generally encountered in satellite communications ) .",
    "the main alternative in this case is the use of _ erasure codes _ that operate at the transport or the application layer of the communication system : source data packets are extended with redundant ( also referred to as _ repair _ ) packets that are used to recover the lost data at the receiver .",
    "physical ( phy ) and upper layer ( ul ) codes are not mutually exclusive , but they are complementary to each other .",
    "adaptive coding schemes are also required at the upper layer , in order to dynamically adjust to variable loss rates . besides , codes with very small rates or even _ rateless _",
    "@xcite are sometimes used at the application layer for fountain - like content distribution applications .    in this paper",
    "we propose a coding technique that allows to produce extra redundant bits , such as to decrease the coding rate below the mother coding rate .",
    "extra redundant bits can be produced in an incremental way , yielding very small coding rates , or can be optimized for a given target rate below the mother coding rate .",
    "as for puncturing , the proposed technique allows for using the same decoder , regardless of how many extra redundant bits have been produced , which considerably increases the flexibility of the system , without increasing its complexity .",
    "the proposed coding scheme is based on non - binary low density parity check ( nb - ldpc ) codes @xcite or , more precisely , on their _ extended binary image _ @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 denotes the size of the non - binary alphabet , each non - binary symbol corresponds to a @xmath1-tuple of bits , referred to as its binary image .",
    "extra redundant bits , called _ extended bits _ , are generated as the xor of some bits from the binary image of the same non - binary coded symbol .",
    "if a certain number of extended bits are transmitted over the channel , we obtain an _ extended code _ , the coding rate of which is referred to as _ extended ( coding ) rate_. in the extreme case when all the extended bits are transmitted , the mother code is turned into a _ very small rate _ code , and can be used for fountain - like content distribution applications @xcite . a similar approach to fountain codes , by using multiplicatively repeated nb - ldpc codes , has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "if some extended rate is targeted , we show that the extended code can be optimized by using density evolution methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : nbldpc_codes ] gives the basic definitions and the notation related to nb - ldpc codes . in section [ sec : extended_nbldpc_codes ] , we introduce the extended nb - ldpc codes and discuss their erasure decoding .",
    "the analysis and optimization of extended nb - ldpc codes are addressed in section [ sec : analysis_optimization ] .",
    "section [ sec : code_design_performance ] focuses on the code design and presents simulation results , and section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider nb - ldpc codes defined over @xmath2 @xcite , the finite field with @xmath3 elements , where @xmath4 is a power of @xmath5 ( this condition is only assumed for practical reasons ) .",
    "we fix once for all an isomorphism of vector spaces : @xmath6 elements of @xmath2 will also be referred to as _ symbols _ , and we say that @xmath7 is the _ binary image _ of the symbol @xmath8 , if they correspond to each other by the above isomorphism .",
    "a non - binary ldpc code over @xmath2 is defined as the kernel of a sparse parity - check matrix @xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , it can be represented by a bipartite ( tanner ) graph @xcite containing symbol - nodes and constraint - nodes associated respectively with the @xmath10 columns and @xmath11 rows of @xmath12 . a symbol - node and a constraint - node",
    "are connected by an edge if and only if the corresponding entry of @xmath12 is non - zero ; in this case , the edge is assumed to be _ labeled _ by the non - zero entry .",
    "as usually @xcite , we denote by @xmath13 and @xmath14 the left ( symbol ) and right ( constraint ) edge - perspective degree distribution polynomials . hence , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the fraction of edges connected respectively to symbol and constraint nodes of degree-@xmath19 .",
    "the design coding rate is defined as @xmath20 , and it is equal to the coding rate if and only if the parity - check matrix is full - rank .",
    "for any integer @xmath21 , let @xmath22 = ( k_0 , \\dots , k_{p-1})^{\\text{t}}$ ] denote the column vector corresponding to the binary decomposition of @xmath23 ; _ i.e. _ @xmath24 , with @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a non - binary symbol , and @xmath26 be its binary image .",

    "now , consider a nb - ldpc code defined over @xmath2 , with coding rate @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be a non - binary codeword , @xmath36 be its binary image , and @xmath37 be its extended binary image . by transmitting the extended binary image over the channel",
    ", we obtain a code with rate @xmath38 , which can be advantageously used for application requiring very small coding rates @xcite .",
    "we define an _ extension of the nb - ldpc code _ , as a family of matrices @xmath39 , where each @xmath40 is a binary matrix with @xmath1 rows and @xmath41 columns , with @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 ; hence , @xmath44 is constituted of @xmath41 extended bits of @xmath45 ( possibly with repetitions , if @xmath46 contains two or more identical columns ) .",
    "the binary vector @xmath47 is called _ extended codeword _ , and the _ extended coding rate _ is given by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "note that the above definition is very broad , and it can yield extended rates below as well as extended rates above the mother coding rate . in particular , it includes punctured codes : if @xmath50 , \\dots , [ 2^{p-1}])$ ] , then @xmath51 , which is the same as puncturing the first bit , @xmath52 , from the binary image of @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , taking some @xmath53 is equivalent to puncturing the whole symbol @xmath45 .",
    "the optimization of puncturing distributions for nb - ldpc codes has been addressed in @xcite . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the case when matrices @xmath46 are of the form @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 is the @xmath56 identity matrix , meaning that each @xmath44 contains the binary image @xmath57 ( the use of `` extension '' complies with its literal meaning ) .",
    "we will further assume that any two columns of a matrix @xmath46 are different .",
    "it follows that @xmath58 , and each @xmath44 is constituted of the binary image @xmath57 and @xmath59 pairwise different ( nontrivial ) extended bits . in this case",
    ", we shall say that _ the symbol @xmath45 is extended by @xmath60 bits_.    for instance , let @xmath61 and consider that the following matrix @xmath62 is used to extend by @xmath5 bits some coded symbol @xmath27 : @xmath63\\ ] ] then @xmath64 , where @xmath65 denotes the bit - xor operator .    in order to determine the coding rate of the extended code ,",

    "we consider that the extended codeword @xmath47 is transmitted over a binary erasure channel ( bec ) . at the receiver part ,",
    "the received bits ( both from the binary image and extended bits ) are used to reconstruct the corresponding non - binary symbols .",
    "precisely , for each received bit we know its position within the extended binary image of the corresponding symbol .",
    "hence , for each symbol node we can determine a set of _ eligible symbols _ that is constituted of symbols whose extended binary images match the received bits .",
    "these sets are then iteratively updated , according to the linear constraints between symbol - nodes @xcite . alternatively ( and equivalently )",
    ", the extended code can be decoded by using the linear - time erasure decoding proposed in @xcite .",
    "the _ asymptotic threshold _ of an ensemble of codes is defined as the maximum erasure probability @xmath81 that allows transmission with an arbitrary small error probability when the code length tends to infinity @xcite .",
    "given an ensemble of codes , its threshold value can be efficiently computed by tracking the fraction of erased messages passed during the belief propagation decoding ; this method is referred to as _ density evolution_. in this paper , the density evolution is approximated based on the monte - carlo simulation of an infinite code , similar to the method presented in @xcite .",
    "this method has two main advantages : it can easily incorporate the extending distribution @xmath82 , and it can be extrapolated to more general channel models .",
    "]    the goal of this section is to answer the following questions .",
    "first of all , assume that we have given a symbol node that has to be extended by @xmath23 bits .",
    "how should they be chosen among the @xmath83 ( nontrivial ) extended bits ?    secondly , given an extended coding rate @xmath84 , how should be extended bits distributed over the symbol - nodes ? put differently , which is the optimal extending distribution @xmath85 ?",
    "we assume that we have given a symbol - node that has to be extended by @xmath23 bits .",
    "a choice of the @xmath23 bits among the @xmath83 extended bits corresponds to an extending matrix @xmath86 $ ] of size @xmath87 , with pairwise distinct columns .",
    "for each such a matrix , assume that the extended symbol @xmath88 is transmitted over the bec , and let @xmath89 be the expected number of eligible symbols at the receiver .",
    "recall that an eligible symbol is a symbol whose extended binary image match the received bits . if all transmitted bits have been erased",
    ", any symbol is eligible .",
    "conversely , if the received bits completely determine the non - binary symbol , then there is only one eligible symbol . more generally , let @xmath90 denote the sequence of received bits , and @xmath91 denote the submatrix of @xmath62 determined by the columns that correspond to the received positions of @xmath92 .",
    "then the eligible symbols are the solutions of the linear system @xmath93 , and their number is equal to @xmath94 .",
    "now , if @xmath95 denotes the erasure probability of the bec , it can be easily verified that : @xmath96 where the second sum takes over all the submatrices @xmath97 constituted of @xmath98 among the @xmath99 columns of @xmath62 .",
    "hence , in order to minimize the expected number of eligible symbols @xmath89 , we choose @xmath62 such that @xmath100 is maximal , where @xmath100 is the smallest number of linearly dependent columns of @xmath62 .",
