    "for a fluid supercooled isobarically below the melting temperature @xmath2 , the ordered ( say , crystalline ) state is thermodynamically favorable . at the moderate supercooling @xmath3 , the transition into an ordered state is started through nucleation mechanism , that involves emergence of the crystalline nuclei , which are able to grow ; @xmath4 is temperature .",
    "hence , the behavior of the overall transition should be essentially determined by the rate characteristics : the waiting time of the first crystalline critically - sized nucleus @xmath0 , the nucleation rate @xmath5 that is amount of the supercritical nuclei formed per unit time per unit volume , and the growth rate @xmath6 that specifies growth law of the supercritical nuclei .",
    "some general features of the nucleation kinetics can be comprehended within the classical nucleation theory  @xcite and its extensions  ( see in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . according to the classical view",
    ", the driving force for the nucleation grows upon the increase of supercooling .",
    "this means that with the increase of supercooling an ordered state becomes thermodynamically more favorable , while the waiting time for nucleation @xmath0 and the nucleation time scale @xmath7 must be shortened . on the other hand , with temperature lowering ( below the melting temperature @xmath2 ) ,",
    "the mobility of molecules ( atoms ) decreases . as a result ,",
    "any structural rearrangements , including these responsible for nucleation , must be suppressed by the growing viscosity .",

    "@xmath9  pa@xmath10s , it is `` freezing '' as disordered solid ; where the temperature @xmath11 is identified with the glass transition temperature .",
    "although crystallization of glasses proceeds over time - scales  @xcite , which are commonly larger than experimentally acceptable , the structural ordering in a glass can be accelerated by out - of - equilibrium processes resulted from reheating or applied shear deformation  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there are indications ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the time - scales of structural relaxation and of ordering in glassy systems becomes shorter , when we move over _ equilibrium _ phase diagram to the range of more higher pressures . moreover , debated issues in the field are related to the temperature dependence of the transition rate characteristics at deep levels of supercooling  @xcite .",
    "so , for example , empirical @xmath4-dependencies of the nucleation lag - time and of the steady - state nucleation rate are discussed in review  @xcite , where results for some stoichiometric glasses ( @xmath12mgo@xmath10al@xmath13o@xmath14sio@xmath13 , li@xmath13o@xmath15sio@xmath13 , na@xmath13o@xmath15cao@xmath16sio@xmath13 , _ et al .",

    "@xcite within the available experimental data , the lag - time of nucleation and the steady - state nucleation time - scale @xmath17 reach the lowest values at a certain moderate levels of supercooling .",
    "moreover , both rate terms start to grow with the further increase of supercooling and with the approaching the glass transition temperature .",
    "remarkably , the possible correlation discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite between some features in the temperature dependencies of these rates ( for example , the maximum steady - state nucleation rate ) and the reduced temperature @xmath18 provides , in fact , indirect implications about `` unified laws '' , which can be inherent in the nucleation kinetics . in this work , we extend this view by focusing on the crystal nucleation time @xmath0 , identified here as the average waiting time for the first critically - sized nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of unified description using scaling relations has been proposed and studied for the case of nucleation of liquid droplets in _ the condensation process_. here , an intriguing feature emergent in the analysis of data for the vapor - to - liquid nucleation is a supersaturation - temperature scaling of the nucleation rate data  @xcite .",

    "this result is very interesting for the following reasons .",
    "first , scaling relation allows one to compare the nucleation data of various independent studies for a system , even though those studies have not the identical pressure - temperature ( supersaturation - temperature ) conditions .",
    "moreover , if the scaling is valid , then this is indication that there is a single reduced variable instead of the pair , @xmath4 and @xmath25 ; and this variable is sufficient for a unified description of the steady - state vapor - to - liquid nucleation rate .",
    "recently , diemand _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested a new scaling relation for the nucleation rate of homogeneous droplets from supersaturated vapor phase , where other set of the parameters is utilized . from the mentioned considerations , it is reasonable to try to extend the ideas of scaling relations to the case of other transition  to the case of crystallization  @xcite .",
    "the present study is mainly aimed at the consideration of this issue . for this , the analysis of the crystal nucleation times from the experiments and molecular dynamics simulations is carried out for several systems at temperatures @xmath26 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in evaluation of the unified temperature dependencies for characteristics of the supercooled liquids , one encounters the problem that the interested temperature range , @xmath27 , contains three control points  the zeroth temperature @xmath28k ; the glass transition temperature @xmath11 and the melting temperature @xmath2 ,  where @xmath11 and @xmath2 in the kelvin scale have not the same values for different systems .",
    "therefore , there is necessity to use a reduced temperature defined usually either through @xmath2 , or through @xmath11 , depending on the problem  @xcite .",
    "for example , according to angell  @xcite , the inverse reduced temperature @xmath29 is used to fulfill the `` strong - fragile '' classification of viscous ( supercooled ) liquids by means of the plot , in which the viscosity in logarithmic scale , @xmath30 , is considered as a function of @xmath29 . since one has @xmath31 = 12 $ ] ",
    "@xmath32 for all the supercooled liquids by definition , then the values of @xmath30 will be comparable on the reduced temperature scale @xmath33 in neighborhood of @xmath11 .",

    "ambiguity of the choice of reduce temperature scale is because the ratio @xmath18 depends on the system ( material ) and can be different even for the systems of same type .",
    "for example , the ratio of @xmath36 for glasses li@xmath13o@xmath15sio@xmath13 , bao@xmath15sio@xmath37 and 2na@xmath37o@xmath10cao@xmath16sio@xmath37 , which belong to the group of silicate glasses , does not have the same value , and is equal to @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , respectively  @xcite . moreover",

    "this one needs to specify a temperature scale @xmath43 , in which the control points mentioned above  the zeroth temperature , the glass transition temperature and the melting temperature  are fixed and have same values for all systems .",
    "we suggest a possible simple way to realize this .",
