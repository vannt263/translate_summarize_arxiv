    "the circinus galaxy ( a1409 - 65 ) is a nearby ( @xmath14 mpc ) gas rich spiral lying close to the galactic plane in a region of relatively low ( @xmath11.5 mag ) interstellar extinction ( freeman et al .",
    "several observed characteristics indicate that this galaxy hosts the nearest seyfert 2 nucleus known .",
    "these include optical images showing a spectacular [ oiii ] cone ( marconi et al .",
    "1994 hereafter @xcite ) ; optical / ir spectra rich in prominent and narrow coronal lines ( oliva et al . 1994 ,",
    "hereafter @xcite , moorwood et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter @xcite ) ; x - ray spectra displaying a very prominent fe - k fluorescent line ( matt et al .",
    "@xcite ) and optical spectropolarimetric data which reveal relatively broad h@xmath2 emission in polarized light ( oliva et al .",
    "complementary to these is observational evidence that this galaxy has recently experienced a powerful nuclear starburst which is now traced by the near ir emission of red supergiants ( oliva et al .",
    "@xcite , maiolino et al .",
    "@xcite ) and which may have propagated outwards igniting the bright ring of o stars and hii regions visible in the   image ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a starburst could have been triggered by gas moving toward the nuclear region and eventually falling onto the accretion disk around the black hole powering the agn .",
    "a debated issue is whether nuclear starbursts are common features of agns and if they are more common in type 2 than in type 1 seyferts , as suggested by e.g. 10@xmath3 m observations ( maiolino et al .",
    "@xcite ) and studies of the stellar mass to light ratios ( @xcite ) .",
    "since starbursts are predicted and observed to deeply modify the chemical abundances of the host galaxy ( e.g. matteucci & padovani @xcite ) , such an effect should also be evident in this and other seyferts .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no reliable measurement of metallicity for the narrow line region clouds of seyfert 2 s exists in the literature .",
    "in particular , although has been since long known that the large [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratio typical of seyferts can not be easily explained using simple models with normal nitrogen abundances ( e.g. osterbrock @xcite , komossa & schulz @xcite ) , the question of whether its absolute ( n / h ) or relative ( e.g. n / o ) abundance is truly different than solar is still open . finding a reliable method to derive metallicities and , therefore , to trace and put constraints on past starburst activity is the main aim of this paper .",

    "dilution by a stellar continuum is particularly strong in the nuclear spectrum where the equivalent width of [ oiii]5007 is only 50     ( cf .",

    "however , neither of the methods proved particularly useful because line emission contaminates the stellar emission all along the slit , and we could not find any template which accurately reproduces the prominent stellar absorption features typical of quite young stellar populations .",
    "the fluxes of weak lines ( @xmath155% of the continuum ) in the nucleus are therefore uncertain and , in a few cases , quite different than those reported in @xcite , the largest discrepancy being for [ ni ] which is a factor of 2 fainter here .",

    "another interesting result is the steep extinction gradient between the regions outside ( knots c , d , h , i ) and those close to the galactic disk ( nucleus and knots a , e , l ) .",
    "however , a comparison between the  map ( moorwood & oliva @xcite ) , the  images ( @xcite ) and the observed br@xmath2 flux from the whole galaxy ( @xcite ) , do not show evidence of more obscured ( @xmath42 ) ionized regions such as those observed in ngc4945 and other starburst galaxies ( e.g. moorwood & oliva @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , these data can not exclude the presence of deeply embedded ionized gas which is obscured even at 4@xmath3 m ( i.e. @xmath4350 mag ) .",
    "particularly interesting is the variation of the line ratios between the adjacent knots c and d. the ratio [ fevii]/   is a factor of 2 larger in knot d than in c , but this most probably reflects variations of the iron gas phase abundance ( see also sect .  [ iron ] ) . much more puzzling is the spatial variation of the low excitation lines [ oi ] , [ sii ] , [ nii ] which drop by a factor 1.8 , while the high excitation lines heii , [ oiii ] , [ neiii ] , [ ariii ] together with the [ sii ] density sensitive ratio and [ oiii]/[oii ] vary by much smaller amounts ( cf .",

    "the relatively large ( oiii ) , slightly lower ( siii ) and much cooler [ nii ] , [ sii ] temperatures are typical of gas photoionized by a `` typical agn '' , i.e. a spectrum characterized by a power law continuum with a super  imposed uv bump peaked at @xmath4450100 ev ( e.g. mathews & ferland @xcite ) .",
    "as ( oiii ) mainly depends on the average energy of @xmath45 ev ionizing photons , `` bumpy '' spectra , which are quite flat between 13 and 54 ev , yield hot [ oiii ] .",
    "the lower ionization species , such as [ nii ] and [ sii ] , mostly form in the partially ionized region , heated by soft x  rays , whose temperature can not exceed 10@xmath46 k due to the powerful cooling by collisionally excited ly@xmath2 and 2photon emission . the contrast between the oiii and nii temperatures can be further increased if sub ",
    "solar metallicities are adopted , because [ oiii ] is a major coolant while [ nii ] only plays a secondary role in the cooling of the partially ionized region .",
    "an alternative explanation for the oiii , nii etc .",
    "temperature differences is to assume that part of the line emission arises from density bounded clouds . in this case",
    "there is no need to adopt a `` bumpy '' agn spectrum and detailed models , assuming a pure power law ionizing continuum , were developed by binette et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that ( oiii)@xmath43(nii ) does not necessarily indicate the presence of density bounded clouds .",
    "there is a clear trend between   and excitation of the species used to determine the density .",
    "the [ sii ] red doublet yields densities lower than [ oii ] which is compatible with a single - density cloud for the following reason .",
    "if the flux of soft x - rays ( 200 - 500 ev ) is strong enough , then [ sii ] lines are mostly produced in the x - ray heated region where the average hydrogen ionization fraction is quite low ( @xmath370.1 ) .",
    "the lines of [ oii ] on the contrary can only be produced in the transition region , where the ionization degree is close to unity , because of the very rapid o ",
    "h charge exchange reactions .",
    "hence ( sii)@xmath15(oii ) most probably indicates the presence of a strong soft - x flux , as one indeed expects to be the case for an agn spectrum .",
    "this is also confirmed by the detailed modelling described below .",
    "the higher densities in the fully ionized region are new results because the blue [ ariv ] doublet is usually too weak in agn spectra and the fir [ nev ] lines are only accessible with the iso - sws spectrometer ( @xcite ) .",
    "the [ ariv ] density of knot c is equal , within the errors , to that derived by [ oii ] thus indicating that no large variations of densities are present in this cloud .",

    "strong evidence against shock excitation comes from the very low strength of [ feii ] which indicates that iron is strongly underabundant , i.e. hidden in grains , within the partially ionized region ( cf . figs .",
    "[ figz ] , [ figznoch ] ) .",
    "shocks are very effective in destroying dust grains , and velocities as low as 100 km / s are enough to return most of the iron to the gas phase ( e.g. draine & mckee @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite ) and supernova remnants whose near ir spectra are dominated by prominent [ feii ] ir lines ( e.g. oliva et al .",
    "although the low fe@xmath48 gas phase abundance could , in principle , be compatible with a very slow shock ( @xmath3750 km / s ) , this falls short by orders of magnitude in producing high excitation species .",

    "it should be noted that , although stronger heii could probably be obtained by increasing the shock speed to @xmath411000 km / s , these velocities are incompatible with the observed line profiles .",
    "more generally , the observed line widths ( @xmath15150 km / s , @xcite ) are difficult to reconcile with the fact that only shocks faster than 300 km / s can produce prominent high excitation lines such as [ oiii ] ( dopita & sutherland @xcite ) .",
    "this argument becomes even stronger when interpreting the nuclear spectra where the highest excitation lines , [ fex , xi ] , do not show any evidence of large scale motions at velocities @xmath43200 km / s .",
    "( cf . @xcite and work in preparation ) .    finally , it is worth mentioning that detailed shock  +  photoionization composite models recently developed by contini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest that shock excited gas does not contribute significantly to any of the optical / ir lines from circinus .",
    "we constructed a grid of models covering a wide range of ionization parameters ( @xmath50 ) , densities ( @xmath51 ) , metallicities ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) and shape of the ionizing continuum which we parameterized as a combination of a power law extending from 1 ev to 10 kev with index @xmath54 and a black  body with @xmath55 , the relative fraction of the two components being another free parameter .",
    "all the parameters were varied randomly and about 27,000 models were produced using cloudy ( ferland @xcite ) which we slightly modified to include the possibility of varying the n",
    " h charge exchange rate .",
    "the line intensities were also computed using the temperature and ionization structure from cloudy and an in  house data base of atomic parameters .",
    "the agreement with the cloudy output was good for all the `` standard '' species while large discrepancies were only found for coronal species ( e.g. [ fex ] ) whose collision strengths are still very uncertain and much debated .",

    "although the choice of the cutoff is arbitrary , it should be noticed that variations of this parameter do not alter the mean values , but only influence the shape of the distributions whose widths roughly double if the @xmath57 cutoff is increased to values as large as 30 .",
    "the large grid described above was also organized to have at least 4 models with the same photon flux , continuum shape and abundances but different densities , and these were used as starting points to construct multi - density models .",
    "we simulated 2density clouds by coupling all available models with different weights and selected about 300 of them , which were used as starting points to compute the `` good models '' following the same procedure adopted for the single - density case .",
    "we also simulated clouds with @xmath583 density components , but these results are not included here because this complication had virtually no effect on the quality of the fit .",
    "the most important result is that single and multi - density models are equally good ( or bad ) in reproducing the observed line ratios .",
    "obviously , this does not necessarily imply that knot c is a single - density cloud , but rather indicates that the stratifications which probably exist have little effect on the available density sensitive line ratios .",

    "it should be noted that this is a fundamental problem unrelated to the details of the photoionization models and primarily reflects the fact that the [ fevii ] line has a very small collision strength ( @xmath99 ) which is factor of about 10 lower than the [ feii ] transition . a fe@xmath100/fe@xmath101 integrated relative abundance is thus required to reproduce the observed line ratio .",

    "the slow shock produced by the ionization front which propagated outward when the agn turned on was too slow ( @xmath10240 km / s ) to effectively return fe to the gas phase ( e.g. draine & mckee @xcite ) .",

    "free gas processed by the shock is kept fully ionized by the agn radiation . however , this situation is short lived because , after a few thousand years , the gas piled up behind the shock will eventually reach a column density high enough to become radiation bounded , and shield the recombining gas which will therefore show up in [ feii ] .",

    "although [ ni]5200 has a quite low critical density ( @xmath11500 @xmath103 ) , this error can not be attributed to the presence of higher density clouds because these would also effect the [ sii ] density sensitive ratio . in other words ,",
    "multi - density models which correctly reproduce the high [ nii]/[ni ] ratio inevitably predict too large [ sii]6731/6716 ratios .",
    "also , we can exclude observational errors because , in knot c , the [ ni ] doublet has an equivalent width of about 2.5    and is only marginally affected by blending with neighbouruing stellar absorption lines .",

    "noticeably , the problem we find here is exactly the opposite of what reported by stasinska ( @xcite ) whose models systematically underpredicted the [ ni]/[nii ] ratio in objects with low [ oi]/[oii ] .",
    "a puzzling aspect of the line emission from regions very close to the nucleus is the simultaneous presence of high ( e.g. [ fexi ] ) and low ( e.g. [ sii ] , [ oi ] ) ionization species .",
    "more specifically , the images of @xcite clearly show that [ sii ] peaks at a distance of only @xmath10.5   or 10 pc from the nucleus ( cf .",
    "fig . 9 of @xcite ) .",
    "this result is incompatible with the standard idea according to which low excitation lines are produced in clouds with low ionization parameters .",
    "numerically , combining the ionizing continuum inferred from the spectrum of knot c with @xmath106=1.2@xmath107 @xmath103 , the highest density compatible with the fir [ nev ] doublet ( table  [ diagnostic ] ) , yields @xmath108 at @xmath109=10 pc from the agn , an ionization parameter far too large for the production of low excitation species . not surprisingly therefore , all the models so far developed for the high excitation lines ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) predict that [ sii ] should peak much farther out and have a much lower surface brightness than that observed .    a simple and indeed natural solution is to assume that the low excitation lines are formed in dusty clouds . at these large ionization parameters dust dominates the absorption of uv ionizing photons and , therefore , quenches the heiii and hii strmgren spheres .",
    "consequently , the x  ray dominated partially ionized region starts at much smaller radii , and is also slightly hotter than in the dust free model ( cf .",
    "fig  [ modelnuc ] ) .",
    "therefore , dusty clouds have a [ sii ] peak much closer to the nucleus and a @xmath4310 times higher surface brightness than dust  free clouds . it should be noted , however , that the total luminosity of low excitation optical lines is similar in the two cases , fundamentally because the available luminosity of soft x  rays is the same .    although the combined emission of dusty and dust  free clouds can account for the observed emission of low ionization and coronal species , it falls short by large factors in producing [ oiv ] and other relatively low ionization species which form within the heiii sphere",
    "this is an intrinsic limitation of `` compact models '' such as those of fig .",
    "[ modelnuc ] , and can be understood as follows .",
    "compact models are characterized by large `` ionization parameters '' ( cf .",
    "sect . 3 of oliva @xcite for a critical discussion on this parameter ) and therefore have large fluxes of oiv ionizing photons which keep oxygen in higher ionization stages ( mostly ovi and ovii ) at all radii inside the heiii strmgren sphere . outside the heiii region , on the contrary",
    ", oxygen can not be ionized above oiii because most of the oiii ionizing photons have already been absorbed by heii . therefore",
    ", oiv can only exist in a very narrow range of radii , just at the edge of the heiii sphere , and its relative abundance is therefore very low .    in practice , we found it impossible to construct a single model which simultaneously produces a compact coronal line region , such as that observed in [ fexi ] ( @xcite ) , and which comes anywhere close to the [ oiv]25.9/[oiii]5007@xmath10.3 observed ratio .",
    "we did indeed construct many thousands of randomly generated dusty and dust  free models , and attempted an approach similar to that used for knot c ( sect .",
    "[ details_photion ] ) but , in no case , could we find a model which satisfies these contradictory constraints .",
    "it should also be noted that @xcite independently come to a similar conclusion .",
    "the main conclusion therefore is that , regardless of the details of the models , the nuclear spectrum and line spatial distribution can only be modeled by adding a third `` diffuse '' component ( e.g. with a lower filling factor ) to the dusty and dust ",
    "free clouds discussed above and depicted in fig .  [ modelnuc ] . given the large number of free parameters , we abandoned the idea of using photoionization models to constrain abundances and other physical properties of the gas , we made some attempt to verify that a mixture of clouds exposed to the same continuum , and with the same abundances as model # 1 of knot c ( table  [ tab_modelknc ] and fig .",
    "[ agn_cont ] ) could reasonably well reproduce the observed properties of the nuclear spectrum .",
    "however , the results are not too encouraging and , apart from the much improved [ sii ] surface brightness and [ oiv]/[oiii ] ratio , the solutions are not significantly better than those already discussed by @xcite and @xcite , and are not therefore discussed here .",
    "an analysis similar to that used for knot c was also applied to the other extra  nuclear knots using the more limited number of lines available in their spectra .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows .",
    "the abundances derived in the seyfert - type knots a , b , d , g , f ( cf . fig .  [ knotdiag ] ) are similar those found in knot c but affected by much larger errors because of the more limited numbers of lines available for the analysis . in particular , the density sensitive [ ariv ] doublet and the u  sensitive [ arv ] line is not detected in any of these knots , and the reddening correction for [ oii]@xmath110 could be very uncertain in the high extinction regions ( cf .",
    "note @xmath111 of table  [ tab_obs2 ] ) .",
    "we also attempted to verify if the observed line ratios in these knots could be explained as photoionization by the same agn continuum seen by knot c but could not find any satisfactory solution using radiation bounded clouds exposed to the same continuum . adding matter bounded clouds",
    "alleviates the problem ( as already stressed by @xcite ) but requires an _ ad hoc _ choice of their photoelectric opacities , i.e. the radius at which the ionization structure is cut .",
    "in particular , explaining the drop of low excitation lines between the adjacent knots c and d ( cf . sect .  [ spatial_line_distribution ] ) requires matter bounded clouds cut at about 1.2@xmath112 the hii strmgren radius , the exact position of the cut depending on the assumed shape of the agn continuum .",
    "another parameter affecting the ratio of low  to  high excitation lines ( e.g. [ oi]/[oiii ] ) is the iron gas phase abundance which influences the cooling of the partially ionized region ( cf .",
    "[ role_of_dust ] ) . if iron is more abundant in knot d , as indicated by its stronger [ fevii ] line emission ( cf . table  [ tab_obs2 ] and sect .",
    "[ spatial_line_distribution ] ) , than [ oi ] , [ sii ] , [ nii ] could be depressed by the increased [ feii ] cooling .",
    "the abundances derived for the liner  like knots ( h , i ) are very uncertain ( @xmath01.3 dex at least ) .",
    "their spectra are not compatible with illumination from the same continuum seen by knot c but require a harder ( i.e. more x rays relative to 1380 ev photons ) spectrum which could be in principle obtained by filtering the agn continuum through an absorber with a carefully tuned photoelectric opacity .",
    "alternatively , the weak ( in surface brightness ) spectrum of these low excitation knots could be explained by shock excitation , in which case one expects [ feii]16435/@xmath11 and a factor @xmath4310 larger than in the case of pure photoionization .",
    "finally , the oxygen lines in the highly reddened hii  like knots ( e , l ) are too weak to allow any reliable abundance analysis .",
    "deriving abundances of agn clouds from photoionization models has generally been considered to be unreliable because the shape of the agn ionizing continuum and the density distribution of the emitting regions ( clouds ) are both basically unknown .",
    "the more typical approach therefore has been to assume a metallicity and use photoionization models to constrain the agn spectrum and/or the gas density distribution , or just to demonstrate that the gas is photoionized .",
    "although explicit statements concerning the nitrogen abundance are often found in the literature ( e.g. storchi - bergmann & pastoriza @xcite , simpson & ward @xcite ) these are based on a very limited choice of photoionization model parameters and in most cases find oxygen abundances close to solar , in disagreement with what is derived here",
    ". the only other piece of work which covers a model parameter range comparable to that presented here is that by komossa & schulz ( @xcite ) who analyzes a much more limited numbers of lines , e.g. do not include [ ariv , v ] , in a large sample of seyferts .",
    "they find that , on average , oxygen is underabundant by a factor of @xmath412 and that the n / o ratio is only a factor of 1.52.0 above the solar value .",
    "we believe that the analysis presented here leads to more reliable metallicity estimates .",
    "the results presented here indicate that , in spite of the above uncertainties , reliable metallicities can indeed be derived from spectra including a large enough number of lines , such as that of knot c. our method has been described in sect .  [ details_photion ] and , in short , is based on the computation of a large number of photoionization models with a minimal personal bias and preconceived ideas on the agn ionizing spectrum and the gas density distribution . in particular , we also considered mixed models with combinations of density and radiation bounded clouds ( @xcite ) as well as models with multiple density components .",
    "we spanned a very wide range of model parameters which were varied randomly , and selected the relatively few ( about 200 ) good models which came closest to reproducing the observed line ratios .",
    "the main results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ figz ] , [ figznoch ] which show the distribution of element abundances required to reproduce the observed line ratios .",
    "the most remarkable feature is that the metal abundances are quite well constrained in spite of the very different assumptions made for the gas density distribution and shape of the agn continua . in other words ,",
    "models with very different abundances fail to match the observed lines ratios in knot c regardless of the agn spectral shape and/or gas density distribution assumed .",
    "another encouraging result is that lines from different ionization stages yield similar abundances which simply reflects the fact that the models reproduce the observed line ratios reasonably well .",
    "there are however remarkable exceptions , such as the [ nii]/[ni ] and [ feii]/[fevii ] ratios which are both predicted too high .",
    "possible explanations for these differences have been discussed above ( sects .",
    "[ iron ] ,  [ nii_ni ] ) .",

    "the nitrogen overabundance is of particular interest in view of its possible relationship with the ( circum)nuclear starburst and n  enrichment from material processed through the cno cycle .",
    "according to chemical evolutionary models of starburst events , the n / o relative abundance reaches a maximum value of [ n / o]@xmath125 ( i.e. 4 times the solar value ) at about @xmath126 yr and remains roughly constant for several @xmath127 years ( cf . fig .  4 of matteucci & padovani @xcite ) .",
    "the nitrogen overabundance mostly reflects the effect of the winds from he burning red supergiants whose surface composition is strongly n  enriched by gas dredged  up from the shell where hydrogen was burned through the cno cycle .",
    "the amount and temporal evolution of the n / o abundance depends on model details , e.g. the shape of the imf and the duration of the starburst , as well as on poorly known parameters such as the efficiency of the dredge  up and the contribution of primary n production by massive stars ( e.g. matteucci @xcite ) .",
    "it is however encouraging to find that the observed n / o abundance ( table  [ tab_z ] ) is very close to that predicted at a time which is compatible with the age of the starburst in circinus ( cf .",
    "fig . 9 of maiolino et al .",
    "it should also be noticed that the observed absolute abundances are about an order of magnitude lower than the model predicted values , but this can be readily explained if the starburst transformed only @xmath128 of the available gas into stars , in which case the chemical enrichment was diluted by a similar factor .",
    "this hypothesis is in good agreement with the fact that circinus is a very gas rich galaxy ( e.g. freeman et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in short , the observed n / o",
    "overabundance is fully compatible with what expected for a quite old ( several @xmath127 yr ) starburst .",
    "the [ nii]/   and other line ratios measured in the cone of circinus are similar to those observed in many others sy2 s and several observational results indicate that relatively old starburst events are common in type 2 seyferts ( e.g. maiolino et al .",
    "this may therefore indicate that nitrogen is typically overabundant in sy2 s due to enrichment by the starburst associated with the agns .",
    "this tantalizing conclusion should be however verified by detailed spectroscopic studies and analysis of a sufficiently large number of objects .",
    "by modelling the rich spectrum of an extranuclear cloud in the ionization cone of the circinus galaxy we have found that metal abundances are remarkably well constrained , regardless of the assumptions made on the shape of the ionizing continuum and gas distribution .",
    "this new result may open a new and interesting field of research using photoionization models to derive metallicities in agns which could in turn be related to the star formation activity in the recent past , i.e. old nuclear starbursts . in the case of circinus ,",
    "the large n / o overabundance found here is fully compatible with what expected from chemical evolution models of starbursts ( sect .",
    "[ n_and_starburst ] ) .    much less encouraging",
    "are the results on the agn ionizing continuum whose shape can not be constrained by the observed line ratios but depends on the assumed gas density distribution . within the limits of the model parameters spanned here we somewhat favour an agn spectrum with a `` uv  bump '' but can not exclude that , with a different and better tuned combination of density and radiation bounded clouds",
    ", one could achieve similarly good fits with a power law agn continuum ( sect .",
    "[ detail_knc_model ] ) .",
    "we also found that photoionization models can not reproduce the observed [ fevii]/[feii ] and [ nii]/[ni ] ratios and argued that these may reflect errors in the collision strengths for [ fevii ] and rate coefficient of n  h charge exchange reactions .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the problem [ nii]/[ni ] does not significantly influence the derived nitrogen abundance .",
    "we thank roberto maiolino and francesca matteucci for useful discussions , luis ho and thaisa storchi bergman for providing information on template stellar spectra , gary ferland for making cloudy available to the community , and an anonymous referee for many comments and criticisms which have been fundamental for improving the quality of the paper ."
