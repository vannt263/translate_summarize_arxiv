    "following the discovery of the higgs boson , one of the main tasks of a future linear @xmath1collider will be precise model - independent measurements of its fundamental couplings to fermions and bosons and its total width @xcite .",
    "the branching fraction of the higgs boson into two photons , bf(@xmath8 ) , is of special interest since deviations of bf(@xmath8 ) ( or the diphoton higgs partial width @xmath12(@xmath8 ) ) from the standard model ( sm ) value provide sensitivity to new physics . in particular , by virtue of the fact that the @xmath8coupling can have contributions from loops containing new charged particles , significant differences from the sm value are possible .",
    "thus , a measurement of bf(@xmath8 ) at the next linear collider will be an important contribution to understanding the nature of the higgs boson and may possibly provide hints for new physics , regardless of the size of the deviation from the sm prediction .",
    "the precision of the @xmath13 branching fraction measurements within reach in @xmath1collisions is the subject of this paper .",
    "the ultimate goal of this measurement is to derive the diphoton higgs boson partial width .",
    "however this needs knowledge of the total higgs width .",
    "the total width of a light sm higgs boson is too small to be observed directly  @xcite .",
    "the procedure for obtaining this quantity requires measurements of the product @xmath14 in the @xmath15 collider option of a linear collider and @xmath16 , a quantity easily accessible with high precision in @xmath1collisions @xcite .",
    "as both these measurements can be achieved with an accuracy of few percent , the error of the total higgs width will be dominated by the error of @xmath17 ) .    however , it has recently been demonstrated that a measurement of the branching fraction bf@xmath18 @xcite at a high - luminosity linear @xmath1collider , combined with a precise value for the rate of the ww fusion process @xmath7 ( or for the higgsstrahlung production rate @xmath19 and assuming w , z - universality ) , would permit an accurate measurement of the total width of the higgs boson .",
    "precise electroweak data indicate the existence of a light higgs boson @xcite with a mass below about 200 gev , with a preference for @xmath20 close to 120 gev .",
    "high - luminosity linear @xmath1colliders in the energy range 300 to 500 gev @xcite are ideal machines for performing precise measurements of the properties of such a particle . in this paper",
    "we investigate the prospects of measuring the branching fraction bf(@xmath8 ) from events of the reactions @xmath21 and @xmath22 assuming a higgs boson mass @xmath20 = 120 gev , at @xmath9 = 350 and 500 gev and an integrated luminosity of 1 ab@xmath2 at each energy",
    ".    the statistical precision for bf(@xmath8 ) is mainly determined by @xmath23 , where s and b are respectively the number of signal and background events within a small interval of the two - photon invariant mass @xmath24 , centered around @xmath20 .",
    "hence , evaluation of all relevant signal and background processes and optimization of selection procedures are mandatory , taking into account acceptances and resolutions of a linear collider detector .",
    "our analysis is superior in some respects to the study of ref.@xcite .",
    "it includes the complete irreducible background in reactions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and demonstrates for the first time the gain in the precision of bf(@xmath8 ) when beam polarization is accounted for in signal and background events .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we discuss simulation of the higgs signal and background events and their detector response . in sections  3 and",
    "4 we present our results for unpolarized bf(@xmath8 ) measurements at @xmath9  =  350 and 500  gev , respectively . in section  5",
    "we discuss improvements to the @xmath8branching fraction measurement with beam polarization .",
    "section  6 summarizes the conclusions .",
    "in @xmath25 collisions the higgs boson is produced by two different processes , the higgsstrahlung process @xmath26 and the weak boson ( ww and zz ) fusion reactions + @xmath27 @xmath28    the zz fusion process ( 5 ) is strongly suppressed with respect to reaction ( 4 ) ( by about a factor of 10 relatively independent of @xmath9 ) .",
    "therefore , only the higgsstrahlung and ww fusion reactions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are considered in this study .",
    "these processes are part of the 2-to-4 body reactions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) if only the most important z @xmath29 ( of @xmath3070@xmath11 ) and @xmath31 ( of @xmath3020@xmath11 ) decays and the @xmath8decay are accounted for . thus , to be most general in our analysis , events of reactions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were generated by means of the program package comphep @xcite , including initial state bremsstrahlung and beamstrahlung for the tesla linear collider option @xcite . in this way , higgs boson production and the complete irreducible background as well as possible interferences are taken into account .",
    "the branching fraction for @xmath8was imported from the program package hdecay @xcite .",
    "it depends on the higgs mass and is largest near @xmath20 = 120 gev . in this study we used bf(@xmath8)= @xmath32 .",
    "the higgsstrahlung reaction ( 3 ) is characterized by two hadronic jets originating from the z , together with two energetic photons with an invariant mass equal to @xmath20 .",
    "the background expected in reaction ( 1 ) comes from the 100 lowest - order diagrams with @xmath33 , which are shown , for the d - quark as an example , in fig .  1 .",
    "the most serious background arises from the double bremsstrahlung process @xmath1@xmath34 . because of its importance , @xmath35 events estimated with comphep have been cross - checked at the generator level with koralz 4.2 @xcite and found to be in good agreement in the @xmath36 invariant mass range relevant for this study .    for the signal events in reaction ( 2 ) , with contributions from ww fusion and higgsstrahlung processes ( and small interferences between them ) , we expect a signature of two photons , producing two large electromagnetic neutral showers in the detector with no other activities , and large missing energy due to the two undetected neutrinos .",
    "the background diagrams contributing to reaction ( 2 ) are shown in fig .",
    "they were accounted for at the same level as the signal events .",
    "again , the most serious , irreducible background was found to arise from the double bremsstrahlung process @xmath37 .",
    "possible reducible backgrounds to @xmath1@xmath38 events which might mimic the signal , such as the reactions @xmath1@xmath39 and @xmath1@xmath40 with large cross sections , were found to be very small after application of selection criteria .",
    "processes like @xmath1@xmath41 or @xmath1@xmath42 ( @xmath1 ) @xmath36 , when both electrons are undetected , might constitute a significant background to @xmath1@xmath3 , @xmath43 @xmath44 events .",
    "however , after kinematical cuts their rates were also found to be small or negligible .    as the cross sections for the background discussed are orders of magnitude larger than the signal cross sections , we first applied the following principal cuts at the generation level , to both the signal and background events :    * the transverse energy , @xmath45 , for each photon exceeds 20 gev ; * the two - photon invariant mass , @xmath46 , is required to be larger than 100 gev ; * the @xmath47 invariant mass , @xmath48 , is within @xmath49gev .",
    "after these criteria , practically all higgs events survive , while background contributions are substantially reduced .",
    "the detector response for all signal and the remaining background events was simulated with the parametrized detector simulation package simdet @xcite using parameters as presented in the conceptual design report @xcite .",
    "different higgs event rates are expected from processes ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) at our two energies , @xmath9 = 350 and 500 gev .",
    "the higgsstrahlung cross section scales , after a maximum close its threshold , with @xmath50 , while the fusion cross section rises logarithmically with @xmath9 . at 350 gev ,",
    "the higgsstrahlung cross section is approximately 140 fb for @xmath20 = 120 gev , which is about four times larger than the ww fusion cross section .",
    "since the z boson hadronic decay is by far dominant , @xmath51 events constitute the main source of the higgs signal at 350 gev . the z invisible @xmath31 decay in the higgsstrahlung and the fusion channels lead to identical event topologies - two isolated high energy photons and a large missing energy due to the two undetected neutrinos - are treated together in our study .",
    "considering only z branching fractions into @xmath47 and @xmath31 and the higgs decay into two photons , we expect about 220 respectively 130 higgs events in reactions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) at 350 gev for an integrated luminosity of 1 ab@xmath2 .",
    "different event selection procedures were applied to the @xmath51 and @xmath52 event samples in order to account for their distinct properties in the final state .    in order to avoid large not useful event samples the following preselection procedure",
    "was applied to the 2-jet 2-photon candidates :    * at least two isolated neutral clusters compatible with photons exist , with transverse energy e@xmath53 20 gev for each ; * no particle exists in a half cone of @xmath54 around the isolated photon directions ; * the number of charged tracks per event exceeds 5 ; * the visible event energy , e@xmath55 , exceeds 0.8 @xmath56 gev ; * the total momentum along the beam direction is within @xmath57 100 gev ; * all particles , excluding the two selected photons , were forced into two hadronic jets with an invariant mass compatible with the z boson , 70 @xmath58 110 gev .",
    "after all cuts the background to the higgsstrahlung events close to @xmath20 was significantly reduced , but still one order of magnitude larger than the signal , so further and more stringent selection criteria were necessary to improve the signal - to - background ratio .    in a first trial , we applied the conventional method of using consecutive cuts on kinematical variables .",
    "in particular , we demanded    * the energy of the two - photon system is between @xmath59 gev ; * the transverse energy of the two - photon system is larger than 50 gev ; * each photon polar angle is restricted to @xmath60 ; * the polar angle of the two - photon system is required to be @xmath61 .",
    "these cuts gave a selection efficiency of 56@xmath11 for higgs signal events .",
    "secondly , we applied a more sophisticated selection procedure .",
    "kinematical variables of the final state photons and of the @xmath0 subsystem were combined into a global discriminant variable  @xmath62 system ] .",
    "this quantity can be considered as a measurement of the `` higgs - likeness '' of an event , with 0@xmath63 1 .",
    "background events are preferably distributed at low @xmath62 values while for higgs signal events @xmath62 is close to 1 .",
    "the distribution of  @xmath62 is shown in fig .  3 , and a cut of @xmath64 was applied to select the higgs candidates .",
    "this method results to a signal selection efficiency of 42@xmath11 and 2.3 times less background , so that a significant better signal - to - background ratio exists compared to the application of consecutive cuts",
    ". therefore , only results using the discriminant variable procedure are discussed in the following .",
    "the @xmath36 invariant mass spectrum for @xmath51 signal and surviving background events is shown in fig .",
    "the superimposed curve is the result of a fit to the sum of a gaussian , used to describe the signal , and a second order polynomial function , which was found to describe the background in very good approximation between 110 and 130 gev .",
    "file = higgs_prob.eps , width=14 cm    from the normalizations of the signal and background , which were allowed to vary , the number of signal and background events in an optimal @xmath46 window width of 2.5 gev around @xmath20 is obtained , centered on the actual higgs mass . ] .",
    "these numbers are collected in table  1 and suggest a statistical error of 27@xmath11 for @xmath65 ) in the reaction @xmath1@xmath66 .    the higgs signal selection from the @xmath67 final state relies on events without charged tracks in the detector . for the neutral clusters , compatible with photons ,",
    "the following criteria were required :    * at least two electromagnetic clusters have transverse energies larger than 20 gev ; * their polar angles are within @xmath68 ; * the polar angle of the two - photon system is restricted to @xmath69 .",
    "these cuts gave a higgs selection efficiency of 45@xmath11 and removed possible backgrounds to a large extent .",
    "the resulting @xmath70 mass distribution is shown in fig .",
    "the number of signal and background events , obtained from an analogous fit procedure , are also shown in table  1 .",
    "they allow for @xmath71 . after combining the @xmath72 and @xmath52 final states and neglecting the presumably small higgs cross section uncertainties ,",
    "the h @xmath73 branching fraction error is estimated to 18@xmath11 at @xmath9 = 350 gev .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  2 : cross section scaling factors of higgsstrahlung and ww fusion processes for various left - handed and rigth - handed polarization degrees , normalized to the unpolarized event rates .",
    "in this study we examined the prospect at a future linear @xmath1collider of measuring the branching fraction of a standard model - like higgs boson into two photons , bf(@xmath8 ) . a higgs boson mass of 120 gev and an integrated luminosity of 1 ab@xmath2 at either @xmath9 = 350 or 500 gev were assumed .",
    "in order to estimate the precision attainable on bf(@xmath8 ) , all expected backgrounds were included in the analysis , and acceptances and resolutions of a linear collider detector were convoluted . in particular , by simulating the 2-to-4 particle reactions @xmath1@xmath74 and @xmath1@xmath75 , in which the signal reactions are embedded , the complete irreducible background has been accounted for .    at 350 gev , where both the higgsstrahlung and the ww fusion mechanisms contribute significantly , the statistical error for bf(@xmath8 ) is  18% , after combining both higgs production channels and and convolution with the uncertainty of the more easily measurable inclusive higgs boson cross sections .",
    "it should be noted that the isolation of @xmath1@xmath76 signal events required a multidimensional analysis on a likelihood estimator .",
    "otherwise , background from double bremsstrahlung is overwhelming and greatly hinders the bf(@xmath8 ) measurement .    at 500 gev ,",
    "only the @xmath77 final state is worth consideration and the application of consecutive cuts on kinematical variables resulted in a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio and a convincing signal .",
    "the relative precision expected for the @xmath78 branching fraction is found to be  16% .",
    "if 80@xmath11 left - handed electrons collide with 40 ( 60)@xmath11 right - handed positrons the higgsstrahlung and ww fusion cross sections are significantly enhanced , so improving substantially the precision on bf(@xmath8 ) , even taking into account that the background scales in the same way . under such circumstances , the uncertainty for bf(@xmath8 )",
    "is lowered to 12.8 ( 12.1)@xmath11 and 10.2 ( 9.6)@xmath11 at @xmath9 = 350 and 500 gev , respectively . with these uncertainties",
    "it should be possible to deduce a relative precision for the diphoton higgs partial width of @xmath79 and 11.1@xmath80 at @xmath9 = 350 and 500 gev , respectively , if an uncertainty of 4.3% for the total higgs width @xcite is accounted for .",
    "these uncertainties are about a factor 5 worse than those expected from the reaction @xmath81 @xcite , measurable after conversion of an @xmath1collider to a compton collider .",
