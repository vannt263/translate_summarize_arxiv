    "since yet , we do not have perfectly reliable candidate to test the phenomenological aspects of quantum theory of gravity .",
    "spacetime singularity is one of the avoidable issue in quantum theory of gravity , so research on properties of regular black hole solutions is much important in quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the regular black hole solutions have event horizons but there is the absence of such region where closed timelike curves may exist , i.e. , such solutions are singularity free . of course ,",
    "these are non - vacuum solutions of einstein field equations and source of gravity is taken as some form of exotic field , non - linear electrodynamics or some modified form of gravity .",
    "the regular bh solution was formulated by bardeen which is commonly known as bardeen bh ( bardeen 1968 , borde 1994 and borde 1997 ) .",
    "later on , ayon - beato and garcia ( ayon - beato and garcia 1998 ) carried out the coupling of einstein field equation and maxwell field equations and derived the charged version of bardeen .",
    "for this version of regular bh , they take the non - linear electric field as a source of charge for the solution of maxwell field equations .",
    "the physical nature of charged regular bh was studied by the bronikov ( bronnikov , 2000 , bronnikov , 2001 ) , he showed analytically that charged regular bhs are not correct solutions of the field equations .",
    "the main cause of such unsatisfactory interpretation was the addition of electromagnetic lagrangian quite differently in the various direction of the space under consideration .",
    "on the other hand a correct solution of the field equations was given by hayward ( hayward , 2006 ) , which is free of charge term and its physical aspects are quite similar to bardeen bh .",
    "the limits of the hayward bh are quite correct as in the limit @xmath0 , it corresponds to schwarzschild bh and for @xmath1 , it corresponds to de - sitter bh .",
    "the particular choice of solution parameters imply that it may have two horizons , single horizon and no horizon . a lot of work ( sharif and abbas 2013a , 3013b , 2013c ) has been done on the nature and structure of regular bh .",
    "one of the most challenging tasks in theoretical physics is to combine quantum theory and general relativity , which can be done by clarifying the structure of singularities occurring in general theory of relativity . in this regard",
    "the geodesic study near the gravitational field of compact objects is much important .",
    "this study was initiated by chandrasekhar ( chandrasekhar 1983 ) , he studied the geodesic of schwardzschild , reissner - nordstr@xmath2 m and kerr bhs . since then there has been growing interest to study the geodesic around bhs .",
    "many researches have studied the geodesics of various bh like geodesic study of the schwarzschild bh in rainbow gravity was studied by leiva et al.(2009 ) .",
    "guha and bhattacharya ( 2012 ) the geodesic motion around five dimensional charged anti - de sitter bh .",
    "fernando et al.(2003 ) have studied the null geodesic of schwarzschild bh in the presence of quintessence .",
    "recently , kalam et al.(2014 ) have explored the geodesic of charged bh in non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "curz et al.(2013 ) have studied the geodesic structure of topological lifshitz black hole in 1 + 2 dimension .",
    "mosaffa ( 2011 ) have explored the geodesic structure in horava - lifshitz bh .",
    "setare and mansouri ( 2003 ) have investigated the null geodesics in horava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "several authors have discussed the geodesics of bhs with cosmological constant . in this paper , we have studied the geodesic of a regular hayward bh , which has properties of schwarzschild as well as de - sitter bh .",
    "the static spherically symmetric space - time is described by the hayward metric ( hayward 2006 ) which is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 with @xmath5 corresponding to mass of the black hole and @xmath6 is a convenient encoding of the central energy density @xmath7 , assumed positive .",
    "the lapse function @xmath8 for @xmath9 reduces to @xmath10 , while at @xmath11 it reduces to @xmath12 . from the asymptotic behavior of the metric function , it is clear that hayward bh becomes schwarzschild bh at large value of @xmath13 and for small value of @xmath13 , it is de - sitter bh . the hayward bh solution is non - singular ( regular ) as all the scalars curvature are finite and regular at center of the metric where @xmath1 , which can be verified by scalars of this metric @xmath14    this metric function @xmath8 reduces to the schwarzschild bh for @xmath15 and is flat for @xmath16 . by the analysis of @xmath8 for zeros",

    "this is shown in figure * 1*.     for fixed value of parameter @xmath6 and different values of @xmath5,title=\"fig:\",width=415 ] +    .[1 ]    now , the lagrangian for metric ( [ 1 ] ) is @xmath25 where dot indicates the differentiation with respect to affine parameter @xmath26 .",
