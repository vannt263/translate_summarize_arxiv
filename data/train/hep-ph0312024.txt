    "many signals for new physics at hadron colliders involve electroweak gauge bosons ( @xmath9 ) and jets containing heavy quarks ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the prime example is @xmath11 jets , with one or more jets containing a @xmath12 tag , which led to the discovery of the top quark @xcite .",
    "other examples include signals for the higgs boson and the superpartners of the known particles @xcite .",
    "it is therefore crucial to understand the standard - model background from the production of electroweak bosons and heavy - quark jets with good accuracy .",
    "the simplest processes of this type are the production of a single electroweak gauge boson and one heavy - quark jet . in the case of the @xmath13 boson ,",
    "the leading - order process is @xmath14 @xcite , which has been calculated at next - to - leading order ( with @xmath15 nonzero ) @xcite . for a photon ,",
    "the leading - order process is @xmath16 ( @xmath2 ) , which has also been calculated at next - to - leading order ( with @xmath17 ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the analogous leading - order process for the @xmath0 boson , @xmath1 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gqzq ] , which we calculate at next - to - leading order ( with @xmath17 ) .",
    "an alternative calculational scheme is to regard @xmath18 as the leading - order process ( with @xmath19 nonzero ) , and to allow one heavy quark to be emitted collinear to the beam , yielding a @xmath3 final state .",
    "this approach has two drawbacks .",
    "first , the expansion parameter of this calculation is @xmath20 rather than @xmath21 , so perturbation theory is less convergent . using a heavy - quark distribution function sums these collinear logarithms to all orders , resulting in a perturbative expansion in @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "second , it is much more difficult to obtain the next - to - leading - order correction to @xmath18 than to @xmath1 , both because there is one more particle in the final state , and because the heavy - quark mass must be maintained in the calculation of @xmath18 to regulate the collinear region ( one may set @xmath17 in @xmath1 , provided that the heavy - quark transverse momentum is much larger than its mass ) . at present , @xmath18 is known at next - to - leading order only for @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the next - to - leading - order calculation of @xmath1 ( with @xmath17 ) that we perform in this paper is sufficiently straightforward that the next - to - next - to - leading - order calculation may be available in the foreseeable future @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath1 is a background to @xmath23 , where the @xmath0 boson and the higgs boson decay to the same final state ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , or @xmath26 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath1 could potentially be used to measure the @xmath27 distribution function .",
    "the @xmath12 distribution function is needed for the above - mentioned higgs - production process as well as for inclusive higgs production , @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "it is also needed for the single - top production processes @xmath29 @xcite and @xmath30 @xcite , and the charged - higgs production process @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath32 is much more sensitive to the charm distribution function than to that of bottom , due to the greater electric charge of the charm quark @xcite .    at present , the @xmath12 distribution function is derived perturbatively from the gluon distribution function @xcite and there is no direct measurement of it . the @xmath33 distribution function is similarly derived from the gluon distribution function , and it agrees well with direct measurements .",
    "thus we expect the same to be true of the @xmath12 distribution function .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath12 distribution function derives from the uncertainty in the gluon distribution function .",
    "another source of @xmath3 events is @xmath34 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qqzqq ] , where either one @xmath27 is missed , or the two @xmath27 s coalesce into a single jet .",
    "we show that this process is much more significant at the tevatron than at the lhc , since light - quark distribution functions are relatively more important at large values of bjorken @xmath35 .",
    "this calculation is carried out at leading order with a non - zero @xmath27 mass .",
    "in addition , we also calculate @xmath36 production at next - to - leading order , where @xmath37 denotes a light - quark or gluon jet , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zj ] @xcite . using a silicon vertex detector to tag heavy quarks , the probability that such a jet fakes a heavy - quark jet is around @xmath38 . taking this probability into account",
    ", we show that this source of fake @xmath3 events is comparable to genuine @xmath3 events at the tevatron , but is relatively less important at the lhc .",
    "all of the above processes can also lead to final states with two jets , with varying numbers of heavy quarks . for completeness",
    ", we also calculate these cross sections ( at leading order ) . when combined with the next - to - leading - order cross section for @xmath3 , one obtains the inclusive cross section for @xmath0 plus at least one heavy - quark jet ( at next - to - leading order ) .",
    "the next - to - leading - order calculations in this paper were performed with the monte - carlo code mcfm @xcite .",
    "the leading - order calculations were performed both with this code and with madevent @xcite .",
    "the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculation of @xmath1 parallels our nlo calculation of @xmath23 @xcite , and we refer the reader to that work for a detailed discussion of the calculational scheme .",
    "the contributing subprocesses are    * @xmath1 ( one loop ) * @xmath39 * @xmath40 * @xmath18    the subprocess @xmath34 is considered separately in the following section , and is not regarded as a correction to @xmath1 .",
    "we work in the simplified acot scheme @xcite , which allows one to neglect the @xmath27 mass throughout .",
    "this is a good approximation , and simplifies the calculation .",
    "the error made by this approximation is proportional to @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we use the dipole - subtraction method @xcite as formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite to isolate and subtract collinear divergences .    in our nlo calculation of @xmath1",
    ", we demand one and only one jet with transverse momentum @xmath42 gev within a rapidity range @xmath43 at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "this jet must contain a heavy quark . at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the heavy - quark jet must have @xmath42 gev and @xmath44 .",
    "if two partons lie within a cone of radius @xmath45 , we merge them into a single jet with four - momentum equal to the sum of the two partons four - momenta .",
    "this is done before the cuts described above are applied to the jets .",
    "the nlo process @xmath18 yields two heavy quarks in the final state .",
    "if they are merged into a single jet , we record it as a double - heavy - quark jet .",
    "this is only about 1% of the @xmath3 cross section .",
    "similarly , the nlo process @xmath46 , and processes related by crossing , yield two heavy quarks in the final state .",
    "however , these processes amount to a correction of less than 1% , so we neglect them @xcite .",
    "we list in the first column of tables  [ tab : tev ] and [ tab : lhc ] the lo ( in parentheses ) and nlo cross sections for @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the @xmath49 cross section exceeds that of @xmath50 by 70% at the tevatron and 35% at the lhc because the charm distribution function is larger than that of bottom .",
    "this is partially compensated by the fact that the @xmath0 has stronger coupling to bottom than to charm .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath50 and @xmath49 partonic cross sections is proportional to @xmath51 more importantly , a silicon vertex detector ( svx ) can tag a @xmath12 jet with an efficiency around 60% , and a @xmath33 jet with an efficiency of about 15% .",
    "thus the majority of @xmath3 events tagged with an svx come from @xmath50 .",
    "the nlo processes that contribute to @xmath3 also give rise to final states with more than one jet , and we list these cross sections in the remaining columns .",
    "these events are grouped in three classes .",
    "the second column , labeled @xmath52 , corresponds to events with a single jet that contains two heavy quarks . as mentioned earlier , this is only about 1% of the @xmath3 cross section .",
    "the third column , labeled @xmath53 , corresponds to events with two jets , one of which contains a heavy quark .",
    "this is about @xmath54 of the @xmath3 cross section at the tevatron , and about @xmath55 at the lhc ( for @xmath42 gev ) .",
    "the fourth column , labeled @xmath56 , corresponds to events with two jets , both of which contain heavy quarks .",
    "this is significantly less than @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath56 events arise from the nlo process @xmath57 ( as do the @xmath52 events ) .",
    "the final column sums these various processes , to give the inclusive cross section for @xmath0 plus at least one heavy - quark jet at next - to - leading order .",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ fig : mudep_tevb][fig : mudep_lhcc_lolum ] the scale dependence of the inclusive cross section for @xmath50 and @xmath49 production at the tevatron and the lhc at leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",

    "we use @xmath58 , @xmath59 as our default value of the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "we also estimate the uncertainty in the nlo inclusive cross section .",

    "we maintain the heavy - quark mass throughout the calculation in order to regulate the singularity that would arise from a gluon splitting to massless collinear quarks .",
    "although the nlo cross section for this process with massless quarks is available @xcite , the cross section with massive quarks is known only at lo .",
    "the lo cross section for @xmath3 production via @xmath34 is given in the first column of tables  [ tab : tev ] and [ tab : lhc ] .",
    "at the tevatron , the cross section is about @xmath73 of @xmath1 . at the lhc ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath34 is relatively much less , only about @xmath74 of @xmath1 .",
    "this reflects the fact that this process is initiated by a @xmath75 collision . at the tevatron , where the typical values of bjorken @xmath35 are relatively large , the valence quark distribution functions are significant . in contrast , the typical values of @xmath35 are relatively small at the lhc , so the valence quark distribution functions are less important .",
    "the second column in tables  [ tab : tev ] and [ tab : lhc ] lists the contribution from @xmath34 when the @xmath27 and @xmath76 merge into a single jet .",
    "this is comparable in size to the contribution of this process to @xmath3 production .",
    "this is due to the aforementioned enhancement that arises when the heavy quarks are collinear .",
    "this process is the dominant source of events where the @xmath0 is accompanied by a single jet that contains two heavy quarks .",
    "the last column gives the contribution of @xmath34 when both jets are within the coverage of the detector .",
    "the @xmath77 cross section is about 1/2 of the @xmath50 cross section from this process at both machines , and the @xmath78 cross section is about 1/3 of the @xmath49 cross section .",
    "this is in contrast with the @xmath1 process , where the @xmath56 final state ( that arises at nlo ) is much less than @xmath3 .",
    "a light - quark or gluon jet can fake a heavy - quark jet . with a silicon vertex detector ,",
    "the mistagging rate is typically around 1% .",
    "since the cross section for @xmath36 production is much greater than that for @xmath3 , it is potentially a large source of fake @xmath3 events .",
    "we list in tables  [ tab : tev ] and [ tab : lhc ] the lo ( in parentheses ) and nlo cross sections for @xmath36 production .",
    "the lo processes are @xmath79 ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath80 ( @xmath72 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zj ] .",
    "the nlo processes also contribute to the @xmath82 final state , and we list that cross section in the tables as well .",
    "the @xmath36 cross section is almost two orders of magnitude greater than that of @xmath1 at the tevatron .",
    "taking into account the 1% mistagging rate , we see that @xmath36 is a significant source of fake @xmath3 events at the tevatron . in contrast , at the lhc the @xmath36 cross section is not nearly as significant .",
    "thus there will be relatively fewer mistagged events at the lhc .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained for the ratio of @xmath82 to @xmath53 .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath50 production is @xmath47 . at the tevatron",
    ", @xmath83 also makes a significant contribution .",
    "combining these two contributions , the total inclusive cross section for @xmath50 production at the tevatron is about 20 pb .",
    "thus there are about 2000 inclusive @xmath50 events produced within the coverage of the detector at the tevatron for every 100 pb@xmath84 of integrated luminosity delivered .",
    "the cleanest decay mode of the @xmath0 boson is to leptons ( @xmath85 ) , with a branching ratio of 6.7% . including a @xmath12-tagging efficiency of 60% yields about 80 tagged @xmath86 events for every 100 pb@xmath84 .",
    "there are slightly more tagged events when one accounts for the fact that some events contain two heavy quarks , either within the same jet or in separate jets . with data sets between 4000 and 8000 pb@xmath84 expected in run ii at the tevatron",
    ", there will be between 3200 and 6400 tagged @xmath87 events .    at the lhc ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath83 is much less significant , so most of the cross section comes from @xmath47 .",
    "the total inclusive cross section for @xmath50 production is about 1090 pb , a factor of about 50 larger than at the tevatron .",
    "thus there will be an enormous number of @xmath50 events at the lhc .",
    "the total inclusive cross section for @xmath49 production at the tevatron is about 70% greater than that of @xmath50 , while at the lhc , @xmath49 is about 35% greater than @xmath50 .",
    "however , the svx tagging efficiency for charm is about 1/4 of the @xmath12-tagging efficiency , so there will be fewer tagged @xmath49 events than tagged @xmath50 events . in contrast , the number of @xmath88 events far outweighs the number of @xmath89 events at both machines , since charm has twice the electric charge of bottom and the charm distribution function is larger than that of bottom . even taking the greater tagging efficiency of bottom into account , the number of tagged @xmath88 events is larger than the number of tagged @xmath89 events @xcite .",
    "@xmath36 events , where the jet is mistagged as a heavy quark , are a significant source of fake @xmath3 events at the tevatron , but much less so at the lhc .",
    "thus a larger fraction of the tagged @xmath3 events at the lhc will be from genuine heavy - quark production .",
    "for this reason , and also due to the relatively smaller contribution from @xmath34 , the lhc provides a cleaner environment for the extraction of the heavy - quark distribution functions via @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to the decay @xmath90 , there will be many @xmath91 events ( @xmath92 ) , which will yield heavy - quark monojets .",
    "this will also yield dijet events with large missing transverse momentum , with one or both jets containing heavy quarks .",
    "regardless of the @xmath0 decay mode , the majority of @xmath93 jet events with a single heavy - quark tag at the lhc come from @xmath53 , not @xmath56 . at the tevatron , where @xmath34 is relatively more important , the @xmath53 and @xmath56 final states are comparable in size .",
