    "x - ray emission has been observed for many of the solar system objects , e.g. for mars @xcite , venus @xcite , earth and the moon @xcite , jupiter and the galilean satellites @xcite , saturn @xcite , comets @xcite , and in the heliosphere @xcite .    for the solar system planets ,",
    "x - rays are known to be generated via different mechanisms .",
    "the main mechanisms are :     continuum bremsstrahlung emission due to collisions with electrons ( produces mostly hard x - rays ) ;     excitation of neutral species and ions due to collisions , e.g. , with electrons ( charged particle impact ) , followed by line emission ;     stellar x - ray photon scattering from neutrals in planetary atmospheres ( elastic scattering and k - shell fluorescent scattering , requires a significant column density ) ;     charge exchange between the solar wind ions with neutrals ( swcx ) , followed by x - ray emission ;     x - ray production from the charge exchange of energetic ( energies of about a mev / amu ) heavy ions of planetary magnetospheric origin with neutrals or by direct excitation of ions in collisions with neutrals ( this is known to be effective on jupiter , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the cross sections at solar wind energies for charge exchange with the solar wind heavy ions are several magnitudes larger than the cross sections for the excitation of the neutral species by electrons @xcite , which makes the swcx mechanism more effective .    in the present article",
    ", we discuss the swcx mechanism and x - ray scattering as applied to close - in giant exoplanets , in particular to hd  209458b .",
    "we discuss the observability of the x - ray emission from hd 209458b , x - ray emission from other giant planets , and the influence of the host star age .",
    "other x - ray production mechanisms are beyond the scope of the present article , but will be the goal of a future study .",
    "in the swcx mechanism , an electron is transferred from a neutral atom or molecule to a highly charged heavy ion of the solar wind .",
    "this mechanism is known to produce soft x - rays in cometary comas @xcite . in the case of a magnetized planet",
    ", these ions can enter the neutral atmosphere following the open field lines near the polar cusp .",
    "it is known from experimental and theoretical studies that solar wind heavy ions can undergo charge exchange reactions when they are within approximately 1 nm of a neutral atomic species ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath3 where a is a charged heavy ion in the solar wind ( the projectile ) , q is the projectile charge and b is a neutral component ( target ) .",
    "the product ion @xmath4 is still highly charged and is almost always left in an excited state ( marked by an  * \") .",
    "then , the excited ion emits one or several x - ray photons in the following reaction : @xmath5 although the de - excitation usually represents a number of cascading processes through intermediate states , if q is high then an x - ray photon ( at least one , though usually several ) is emitted @xcite .",
    "the composition of the solar wind by volume is 0.92 hydrogen , 0.08 helium , and @xmath6 heavier elements .",
    "since the solar wind quickly becomes collisionless as it expands , the charge states that the heavy ions have in the hot solar corona are frozen - in , and therefore the heavy elements are usually highly charged . in the solar wind ,",
    "the most common heavy ions are c@xmath7 , c@xmath8 , n@xmath9 , o@xmath9 , o@xmath10 , o@xmath11 , ne@xmath11 , si@xmath12 , fe@xmath13 .",
    "the cross sections for such charge transfer collisions are very high at solar wind energies , exceeding 10@xmath14  @xmath15 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the types of the species that undergo charge exchange define the energy of the emitted x - ray photons , which is usually in the range of 0.30.5  kev .",
    ".planetary and stellar wind parameters , hd  209458b [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t1 ]    in this section , we discuss the soft x - ray emission which can be produced by the swcx mechanism on close - in exoplanets . as an example , we consider hd  209458b , which is a well - studied close - in gas giant orbiting a 4@xmath162  gyr old g - type star .",
    "planetary and stellar wind parameters are summarized in table  [ t1 ] . in our further estimations",
    ", we rely on results of @xcite , who investigated the magnetosphere and stellar wind parameters in the vicinity of hd  209458b by means of modelling . their result support a magnetic moment of hd  209458b of approximately 10% of the jupiter s and a stellar wind with a velocity of @xmath17  cm  s@xmath1 at the time of observation .    for a very simple estimate of the x - ray intensity , @xmath18 , emitted in the region of the atmosphere exposed to heavy ion precipitation one can use the following expression @xcite : @xmath19 where n is a factor of 2 or 3 and represents the number of photons emitted per ion ( below we assume @xmath20 ) .",
    "the additional factor of 2 on the right hand side is a flank magnetosheath enhancement factor @xcite .    for jupiter ,",
    "equation [ e_int ] yields @xmath21  @xmath22 s@xmath1 while values of @xmath23  @xmath22 s@xmath1 are necessary to explain the observed auroral soft x - ray emission , which means that swcx is not the main mechanism that produces soft x - ray emission for jupiter .    for hd  209458b , we assume the stellar wind parameters estimated by @xcite , @xmath24  @xmath25 , @xmath26  cm  s@xmath1 and @xmath27 which gives @xmath28  @xmath22 s@xmath1 or 60600 times the observed jovian values .",
    "given its proximity to its host star , it is unclear whether hd 209458b is located in the sub - alfv@xmath29nic or super - alfv@xmath29nic region of the wind .",
    "the exact regime depends on the magnetic moment of the host star and stellar wind parameters .",
    "although the results of @xcite support that hd  209458b is rather in the super - alfv@xmath29nic regime and thus outside the stellar plasma corotation region , we make an estimate also for the corotation case .",
    "hd  209458 has been observed to have a rotational velocity of 4.4  km / s which corresponds to a rotational period of @xmath3011.5 days @xcite .",
    "this gives the corotational velocity of plasma at 0.047  au of @xmath31  cm  s@xmath1 .",
    "taking into account also the keplerian orbital speed @xmath32  cm  s@xmath1 , this corresponds to the plasma flow velocity in the vicinity of hd  209458b of @xmath33  cm  s@xmath1 . substituting it into the equation [ e_int ] instead of @xmath34 ,",
    "one obtains an estimate of @xmath35  @xmath22 s@xmath1 , which is still 18180 times the observed jovian value .    to estimate the aurora size of hd  209458b we follow the approach of @xcite .",
    "the fractional area of the planetary surface that has open magnetic field lines is @xmath36 for both the north and south auroral caps , where @xmath37 ,       \\label{e_aurora}\\ ] ] @xmath38 is the radius of a planet , and @xmath39 is the magnetosphere stand off distance at the substellar point .",
    "assuming @xmath40 estimated by @xcite , we obtain @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this gives the size of the aurora of @xmath43  @xmath15 , or @xmath44 times the jovian aurora @xmath45",
    "@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "now we can estimate the power of the soft x - ray emission from hd  209458b in both the corotation and non - corotation regimes . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the energy of each emitted x - ray photon is 0.3 kev @xcite . using the solar value of @xmath46",
    ", we estimate the total x - ray power of hd  209458b to be @xmath47  erg  s@xmath1 in the non - corotation regime ( point c on fig.[f1 ] ) and @xmath48  erg  s@xmath1 in the corotational regime ( fig.[f1 ] , point d ) .",
    "note that these values can still present a lower limit .",
    "if charge exchange occurs not only in the auroral regions of hd  209458b , but in the whole hemisphere with the radius of @xmath39 , the values should be multiplied by a factor of @xmath49 , which is the ratio of the interaction area sizes .",
    "this gives @xmath50  erg  s@xmath1 in the non - corotation regime ( point a in fig.[f1 ] ) and @xmath51  erg  s@xmath1 in the corotation regime ( fig.[f1 ] , point b ) .",
    "since the atmospheres of hot jupiters in general and hd  209458b in particular are highly inflated and are believed to extend beyond the magnetosphere @xcite , this is a more realistic case than interaction only in the aurora region ( jupiter type )",
    ". the x - ray production can be even larger if the region outside the magnetosphere ( the volume between the magnetopause and the bow shock ) is included @xcite .      although only a small fraction of the incident stellar x - rays are reflected by the planetary atmosphere , in the solar system this mechanism is known to contribute to the total soft x - ray luminosity of planets and dominates , for example , the x - rays from venus @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the scattering albedo for the outer planets is quite small and equals @xmath52 at 3  nm . we assume this albedo for hd  209458b as a crude estimate .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity of hd  209458 was first observed to be @xmath53  erg  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , later it was reported that this result may present a luminosity of a nearby star and a new upper limit of @xmath54  erg  s@xmath1 was reported @xcite .",
    "both values are close to the solar x - ray luminosity of @xmath55  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "the value of @xmath56  erg  s@xmath1 yields an x - ray flux of @xmath57  erg  @xmath22  s@xmath1 in the vicinity of hd  209458b and an x - ray luminosity of reflected soft x - rays from the planet of @xmath48  erg  s@xmath1 , which is comparable only to our lowest estimate for the x - ray flux produced by the swcx mechanism ( point d in fig[f1 ] ) .",
    "in order to see whether the soft x - ray exoplanetary emission described above could be observable with currently available facilities , we have considered the maximum x - ray luminosity estimated for hd  209458b ( i.e. , @xmath58  erg  s@xmath1 ) and that of its host star ( @xmath59  erg  s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xcite reported only an upper limit of @xmath60  erg  s@xmath1 on the x - ray luminosity of hd  209458 and concluded that @xcite might have confused the star with a nearby object . for our purposes we are interested in the best possible scenario and therefore assume the x - ray luminosity given by @xcite .",
    "a lower stellar x - ray luminosity would make the detection of the planetary x - ray emission harder to detect compared to what described here . by rescaling both luminosities to the distance of hd  209458 ( @xmath61  pc ; @xcite ) , we obtained that the maximum x - ray flux of hd  209458b would be @xmath62  erg  @xmath22  s@xmath1 , while from the star we would get an x - ray flux of @xmath63  erg  @xmath22  s@xmath1 , resulting in a difference of about 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "the planetary x - ray emission could be observed using the secondary transit , as commonly done in the infrared , for example .",
    "the ratio between the in - transit and out - of - transit fluxes is expected to be of the order of 10@xmath64  erg  @xmath22  s@xmath1 , which would require a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the measurements of the order of 10@xmath65 to be detected .",
    "such a high precision is currently reached in the optical and infrared bands ( mostly with space observations ) , but it is prohibitive at x - ray wavelengths . to highlight this , we used the available count rate simulator for the xmm - newton telescope that , among the facilities currently available , has the largest efficiency in the soft x - rays . taking into account the 0.11.0  kev band , a plasma with a temperature of 10@xmath66  k , and the count rate given for the pn detector and the `` thin '' filter we obtained a count rate of @xmath67  counts  s@xmath1 for the x - ray emission of hd  209458 . as a result , the s",
    "/ n obtained exposing for @xmath68  seconds is about 2 and it would require several thousand years of exposure time to reach the s / n required to detect the planetary x - ray emission . the situation might slightly improve if the planetary x - ray emission has a different spectral behaviour compared to that of the star , but the detectability would probably remain unfeasible .",
    "here we have not considered the intrinsic stellar x - ray variability which will hamper the detection of the planetary x - ray emission .",
    "in this section , we briefly consider the influence of the orbital distance on the soft x - ray emission generated by the swcx mechanism ( the radius of hd  209458b is assumed ) .",
    "for the stellar wind parameters , we consider two cases : for one case , we assume the wind has the properties of the slow component of the current solar wind , and for the other case , we scale the wind properties to match what we might expect for the young solar analogue ek dra .    we calculate the solar slow wind parameters as a function of distance from the star using a 1d hydrodynamic wind model that is constrained by _ in situ _ spacecraft measurements of the real solar wind .",
    "the model was developed by @xcite and provides a very good description of the real solar wind outside of the solar corona .",
    "although little is known about the properties of winds from other stars , it is suspected that more active stars have mass fluxes that are significantly higher than the mass flux of the current solar wind @xcite . to scale the slow solar wind model to ek dra",
    ", we use the scaling relation for mass loss rate derived by @xcite and the parameters for ek dra given by @xcite .    we find a mass loss rate , and therefore corresponding values for @xmath69 , for ek dra that are approximately a factor of 15 higher than in the current solar wind .",
    "based on the example of the solar wind , we might expect that the abundances of heavy ions are similar in the corona and in the wind . while it is known that the coronal abundances are correlated with coronal activity for sun - like stars , the coronal abundances of the most active stars are only approximately a factor of two different from the solar values @xcite . since this is an insignificant difference compared to all other uncertainties , for simplicity",
    "we assume a solar value of @xmath27 .",
    "magnetic moments of tidally locked gas giants are believed to be smaller than @xmath70 because of their slower rotation @xcite . for hd  209458b ,",
    "this hypothesis was lately also supported by a modelling result based on the ly@xmath71 transit observations @xcite which predicted a planetary magnetic moment of @xmath72 .",
    "although a prediction of magnetic moments of hot jupiters @xmath73 also exists @xcite , in the present study we assume a moment value in the range of @xmath74 ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the size of the aurora is calculated according to eq .",
    "[ e_aurora ] and the magnetopause stand off distance following the relation @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the diamagnetic permeability of free space , @xmath77 is magnetosphere form - factor .    fig .",
    "[ f1 ] presents the dependence of the emitted soft x - ray power on the orbital distance of the planet .",
    "the letters mark the emission levels for hd  209458b estimated above .",
    "we should note that we did not take into account the unknown rotation rate of the host star , which leads to an overestimate of the plasma flow speed and , respectively , the emission level in the corotation regime .",
    "the letter marks for hd  209458b do nt lie exactly on the lines because of the difference between simple estimates used for @xmath39 and @xmath78 to those estimated via comprehensive modelling by @xcite . as a consequence these plots only qualitatively describe the behaviour of the soft x - ray emission due to the swcx mechanism . for every particular planet , an individual consideration",
    "should be made similar to the one above for hd  209458b .",
    "the main conclusion of our results is that the soft x - ray emission is the highest for closest hot jupiters and strongly depends on the interaction area size ( see the difference between the aurora and the whole hemisphere case  lower and upper red and blue lines , respectively ) .",
    "the simple equation [ e_aurora ] @xcite can be used only for hot jupiters and yields a significant overestimate for jupiter ( see the two green lines ) . for non tidally",
    "locked gas giants on wide orbits , the lower green line presents the most plausible estimate .",
    "we should also note that the corotation regime probably breaks closer to the star than shown on fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . however , this is not so easy to restrict because of many unknown parameters .",
    "soft x - ray emission from exoplanets orbiting a younger star with a denser stellar wind is always stronger than the emission from an planet embedded in the current solar wind ( eq .  [ e_int ] ) , which is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ f1]b , simply because the number of emitted photons is proportional to the wind mass flux assuming the same @xmath79 .",
    "in this work , we presented a simple estimate of the possible x - ray emission from the close - in gas giants emitted due to the swcx mechanism .",
    "we have shown for the example of hd  209458b that this mechanism alone can be responsible for the x - ray emission intensity of the order of @xmath0  erg  s@xmath1 , which is @xmath80 times higher than the x - ray emission from jupiter .",
    "we have discussed the possibility to observe the soft x - ray flux from close - in extrasolar giant planets and have shown that although this emission exceeds the intensity of the jovian soft x - ray emission by several orders of magnitude , it is unobservable with present - day facilities because of the large distances to the systems .",
    "the main conclusion of the study is that hot jupiters should be bright x - ray sources in comparison to the solar system giant planets .",
    "the spectrum of this emission as well as the influence of other x - ray producing mechanisms should be the subject of future study ."
