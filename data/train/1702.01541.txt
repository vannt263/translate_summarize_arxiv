    "sodium represents a neutron poison for the slow neutron capture ( @xmath9 ) process , particularly in massive stars with more than about eight solar masses ( @xmath108 m@xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 process in massive stars is particularly efficient in producing species in the mass range 60@xmath12a@xmath1290 , forming the weak @xmath9-process component in the inventory of the solar abundances .",
    "in addition to its importance for the neutron balance in massive stars , the ( @xmath1 ) cross section of @xmath0na is also needed to follow the production of sodium in low and intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . in these stars ,",
    "the @xmath13 @xmath9 process contributes most of the @xmath9 abundances in the solar system from zr to pb , and the @xmath14 @xmath9-process adds to the pb / bi abundances at the termination point of the @xmath9-process reaction path @xcite .",
    "the weak @xmath9 process in massive stars begins at the end of convective core he - burning ( @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16ne(@xmath17)@xmath18 mg operates as the principal neutron source . during that period",
    ", sodium is only marginally produced by neutron captures on @xmath16ne . during the subsequent convective c - shell burning",
    ", sodium is efficiently made via the @xmath19c(@xmath20)@xmath0na channel although most of the protons ( and sodium ) are consumed by @xmath0na(@xmath21)@xmath22ne reactions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the c - burning layers of massive stars ejected in the subsequent supernova ( sn ) are one of the major sources of sodium in the galaxy @xcite , together with stellar winds from agb stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the convective c - burning shell , neutrons",
    "are mainly released via @xmath16ne(@xmath17)@xmath18 mg reactions as @xmath16ne is present in the ashes of the convective he - burning core and @xmath23 particles are liberated in @xmath19c(@xmath24)@xmath22ne reactions ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the weak @xmath9 process",
    "most of the neutrons are captured by abundant light isotopes , which act as neutron poisons , and only a small fraction is available for captures on iron seed nuclei to feed heavy isotope nucleosynthesis . at solar metallicity ,",
    "more than 70% of the available neutrons are captured by neutron poisons in the he - burning core , and more than 90% in the c - burning shell .",
    "for this reason , it is extremely important to quantify the neutron capture rates of light isotopes such as sodium to evaluate the impact of neutron poisons in the weak @xmath9 process .",
    "another relevant source for the production of sodium are thermally pulsing low - mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) and massive agb stars @xcite , where the @xmath9 process is related to the he shell burning stage of evolution . in a first episode",
    ", neutrons are produced by @xmath25c(@xmath17)@xmath26o reactions during the interpulse phase between he shell flashes at temperatures of @xmath27=0.9 ( @xmath28=8 kev ) @xcite .",
    "the mixing of protons with the top layer of the he shell , required to provide the necessary @xmath25c for neutron production , has the additional effect of activating the nena cycle in the partial mixing zone @xcite , which then continues in the h - burning shell throughout the interpulse phase @xcite . a second",
    ", weaker neutron exposure takes place during the he shell flash at higher temperatures of @xmath29=2.6 ( @xmath28=23 kev ) when the @xmath16ne(@xmath17)@xmath18 mg source is marginally activated . as the he flash engulfs the ashes of the h burning shell , further @xmath0na might be produced by neutron captures on the abundant @xmath16ne during this second phase of @xmath9-processing in thermally pulsing agb stars .",
    "recent studies by cristallo _",
    "_ @xcite and bisterzo _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite confirm that neutron capture production of primary sodium is particularly efficient in low - mass agb stars of low metallicity .",
    "intermediate - mass agb models experience hot hydrogen burning ( hbb ) , which modifies the na abundance on the stellar surface depending on the attained temperature and on the interplay with the efficiency for third dredge up @xcite .    despite of its relevance for nuclear astrophysics ,",
    "the maxwellian averaged neutron capture cross section ( macs ) of @xmath0na is rather uncertain @xcite . in this work",
    ", we present new experimental data for @xmath0na measured in quasi - stellar neutron spectra at thermal energies of @xmath3 and 25 kev .",
    "appropriate spectra have been obtained via the @xmath4o(@xmath5)@xmath4f and @xmath6li(@xmath5)@xmath6be reactions to simulate stellar temperature conditions relevant to @xmath9-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "the experimental details and results of the activation measurements are given in secs .",
    "[ expsection ] and [ anasection ] . in sec .",
    "[ implications ] , macs values are derived for the full range of @xmath9-process temperatures on the basis of the present results .",
    "the implications of these data for the @xmath9-process abundances are discussed for massive stars as well as for agb stars .",
    "similar to many light nuclei , the @xmath0na(@xmath1)@xmath2na cross section is difficult to study experimentally given the high ratio of scattering to capture cross sections . in such cases , neutrons scattered on the sample and subsequently captured in or near the detector can induce a large background when measuring prompt capture gammas with the time of flight ( tof ) technique @xcite .",
    "these difficulties can be avoided with the activation method , because the induced activity of the product nucleus is counted only after the irradiation in a low background environment .",
    "therefore , the activation technique is well suited to measure ( @xmath30 ) cross sections of light nuclei with greater precision than reported previously from tof measurements .",
    "the experiment was carried out by a series of repeated irradiations with a set of different samples and by variation of the relevant activation parameters . in this way",
    ", corrections concerning the dimensions of the samples , self absorption , and the decay during irradiations could be constrained and the determination of systematic uncertainties improved .",
    "the samples for the individual runs were prepared from nacl ( 99.99% pure ) pressed into cylindrical pellets 6 , 8 , 10 , and 15 mm in diameter with varying thicknesses .",
    "as nacl is hygroscopic , care was taken to be sure that the water content of the material gave a negligible contribution to the mass .",
    "this was verified by heating a quantity of the nacl at 250 @xmath31c for two hours , showing that the sample mass before and after heating differed by less than 0.01% .",
    "the sodium cross section was measured relative to that of gold , which is commonly used as a reference in activation measurements .",
    "gold foils 0.03 mm in thickness were cut to the proper diameters and fixed to the front and back of the samples during irradiation .",

    "the neutron exposure starts to increase only in the last phase , close to he exhaustion , when the temperature is high enough to efficiently burn @xmath16ne via @xmath16ne(@xmath17)@xmath18 mg .",
    "the @xmath16ne available at the end of the he core phase is given by the initial abundance of the cno nuclei .",

    "although the macs at 25 kev ( 25@xmath4630 kev is the temperature range of the @xmath9 process during core he@xmath46burning ) is about 10% lower compared to the previous rate @xcite , the final @xmath0na overabundance increases by only a few % and the effect on the @xmath9 abundances between fe and sr is limited to about 1% .",
    "this is explained by the fact that in he core conditions the @xmath0na production is marginal , and its abundance coupled with the low macs implies that the neutron poisoning effect of @xmath0na during core he burning is low .",
    "the final @xmath9-abundance distribution at the end of c shell burning between @xmath44fe and @xmath45mo obtained with the new @xmath0na(@xmath1)@xmath2na macs is compared in fig .",

    "where the c shell stays convective , the neutron density rises from a few 10@xmath56 up to a few 10@xmath19 because all the residual @xmath16ne is consumed in ( @xmath17 ) reactions at the final increase of the c - burning temperature @xcite . in this case",
    ", the higher neutron density will lead to a correspondingly larger modification of the abundance pattern in the @xmath9-process branchings .",
    "it is interesting to note that the higher @xmath9-process efficiency found with the reduced macs data for @xmath0na is partly compensated by the effect of revised ( @xmath1 ) data for the ne @xcite and mg @xcite isotopes .",

    "there are essentially two mechanisms for sodium production in agb stars . at solar metallicities ,",
    "sodium is produced primarily during h shell burning where the mixing of protons with the he shell gives rise not only to the formation of a @xmath25c pocket ( where neutrons are produced via the @xmath25c(@xmath17)@xmath26o reaction ) , but also to related @xmath32n and @xmath0na pockets , thus activating the nena cycle in the latter mixing zone @xcite . under these conditions , neutron reactions on sodium",
    "are of minor importance .    at low metallicities , however , large amounts of primary @xmath16ne are synthesized by conversion of primary @xmath19c into @xmath32n during h burning , which is then transformed during he burning by the sequence @xmath32n(@xmath33)@xmath4f(@xmath57)@xmath4o(@xmath58)@xmath16ne @xcite .",
