    "when a quantum system is adiabatically transported along a closed loop  @xmath0 in a parameter space , in addition to the usual dynamical phase every non - degenerate eigenstate accumulates an extra phase  @xmath1 .",
    "for a 3d - parameter space , m. v. berry gives a geometrical interpretation of  @xmath1 as the flux of a magnetic - like field @xmath2 through a surface with boundary @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the degeneracies of the spectrum in parameter space are the singularities of the vector field @xmath2 , and therefore play an important role in connexion with the geometric phase .",
    "each degeneracy can be seen as a charge distribution located at the contact point between energy surfaces . because the eigenstates are smooth and single valued outside the degeneracies , the total charge of the distribution , i.e. the monopole charge or moment , is necessarily an integer multiple of the elementary charge @xmath3 . in the generic case of a diabolical contact @xcite , the monopole charges are precisely  @xmath4 .",
    "however , higher integer multiples of  @xmath5 may occur .",
    "for instance , for light propagating through a twisted anisotropic dielectric medium there are experimental situations @xcite where the monopole charges are  @xmath6 .",
    "other examples arise in condensed matter physics . in a bidimensional periodic crystalline lattice ,",
    "the hall conductance of a gas of independent electrons is proportional to a topological index , the chern index , that measures the net charge inside a closed surface associated to the first brillouin zone @xcite . in some models , large jumps of the chern index that can not be explained by elementary charges",
    "have been observed  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to discuss a generic mechanism for the production of monopole charges larger than @xmath5 .",
    "the mechanism is due to constraints that act on the system , and may be associated to local symmetries .",
    "section  [ sec : context ] introduces the notation and some general formulae for  @xmath1 . the generic case of a diabolical contact",
    "is briefly recalled in section  [ sec : genericcase ] . in section  [ sec : constraints ] , which is the central part of the paper , a broader class of situations that incorporates constraints is considered .",
    "the consequences on the geometry of the contact point and on the corresponding monopole charges are discussed , and a method to explicitly compute them is introduced .",
    "the latter provides an alternative and simple view of the quantization of the monopole charge as a sum over winding numbers associated to dirac strings .",
    "we illustrate the general approach by two examples in section  [ sec:2examples ] , and show how arbitrarily large multiples of  @xmath5 can actually be generated in  [ sec : largecharges ] .",

    "for convenience , we split @xmath23 into two sets , @xmath25 and  @xmath26 , that corresponds to @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , respectively .",
    "these two sets intersect on  @xmath18 .",

    "berry @xcite gave a _",
    "geometrical _ interpretation ( that is , coordinate free in  @xmath8 ) of the non - dynamical part  @xmath30 of the phase shift that @xmath31 acquires when  @xmath14 follows  @xmath0 adiabatically .",
    "simon  @xcite completed the picture with a _",
    "topological _ interpretation of berry s phase in terms of connection on a suitable fiber bundle .",
    "topological arguments were anticipated in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see in particular the section:a topological test for intersections  , p.85 ) .",

    "we consider the latter case and work in a local chart centered at the contact point , that we assume is located at  @xmath9 . since generically @xmath41_{\\left|\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{0}\\right.}\\ ] ] is different from zero , by virtue of the local inversion theorem we can consider  @xmath42 to be a new local chart in a neighborhood of  @xmath9 . in other words , we can take  @xmath43 .",
    "this is the generic case .",
    "the two energy surfaces  @xmath20 intersect through an isolated doubly - conical contact point ( diabolical point ) @xcite .",
    "from  ( [ eq : b ] ) we have @xmath44 close to a conical intersection the vector  @xmath2 corresponds therefore to the field created by a magnetic monopole of charge  @xmath45  @xcite ( for the state  @xmath46 the opposite charge must be taken ) .",
    "@xmath47 is the vector potential associated to it .",
    "the sets  @xmath48 are the well known dirac ( half ) strings which physically can be interpreted as semi - infinite solenoids ( with end points at  @xmath9 ) carrying a magnetic flux  @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "this magnetic analogy can not however be extended globally since there is no superposition theorem available here .",
    "we now consider situations where some constraints acting on the system are present .",
    "these constraints can be thought of as independent real control parameters  @xmath50 that impose  @xmath51 independent relations between the derivatives of  @xmath52 at  @xmath9 .",
    "physically the control parameters are distinct from the adiabatic parameters  @xmath17 in that they reflect a local symmetry in  @xmath8 and therefore do not change during the adiabatic transport along  @xmath0 . due to these additional constraints , it may happen that the determinant  @xmath53 defined by eq .",
    "( [ def : d ] ) vanishes .",
    "the latter condition requires generically the existence of one external parameter  @xmath54 in addition to  @xmath17 . in that case , the contact between the energy surfaces _ restricted to the  @xmath17-space  @xmath8 _ is not a diabolical point anymore ( see figure  [ fig : econstraints ] ) .",
    "for instance , the charge @xmath55 occasionally observed in ref .",
    "@xcite was found to correspond to a parabolic contact . by increasing the number of parameters @xmath54 one",
    "can accordingly cancel an increasing number of derivatives of  @xmath52 at  @xmath9 , and therefore increase accordingly the degree of tangency of the surfaces defined by  ( [ def : energies ] ) .",
    "if the number of constraints  @xmath51 is finite , in the full @xmath56dimensional parameter space ( that includes both the adiabatic and the control parameters ) , the set of degeneracies is  @xmath51-dimensional and generically crosses transversely at an isolated point located at  @xmath9 any 3-dimensional space defined by  @xmath57 .",
    "it requires an infinite number of constraints to transform  @xmath18 into a continuous family of points since an infinite number of vanishing derivatives of  @xmath52 is needed .",
    "this is the situation when , for instance , the system is invariant under a _ global _ symmetry , like the time reversal symmetry . in that case  @xmath58 at any point in  @xmath8 and  @xmath18 is a 1-dimensional sub - manifold of  @xmath8 .",
    "global symmetries that increase the dimension of the contact manifold are not considered here , we restrict to the cases where the number of constraints due to local symmetries is finite .    under these assumptions , it follows from  ( [ eq : b ] ) that @xmath59 is a distribution with support in @xmath9 .",
    "it can therefore be expanded as , @xmath60 as for an arbitrary circuit in parameter space @xcite , and in contrast to the diabolical contact , generically in the two  dimensional subspace of the degeneracy the geometric phase is not completely determined by because of the non - vanishing curl of  .",
    "our purpose is to determine an explicit rule to compute  @xmath61 .",
    "a more detailed qualitative discussion of the contribution to the geometric phase of the curl of @xmath2 and of the additional multipolar terms in   will be made in the final section .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of the monopoles is the quantization of their charge , which can only take integer multiple values of  @xmath3 .",
    "this easily follows from a topological argument given by @xcite .",
    "consider a small loop  @xmath0 that is smoothly retracted to a point without crossing  @xmath23 .",
    "because the eigenstates remain smooth and single valued , @xmath1 must tend to an integer multiple of  @xmath62 .",
    "but @xmath1 is the flux of  @xmath2 through any surface  @xmath35 with boundary  @xmath0 .",
    "when  @xmath0 shrinks to a point , @xmath35 tends either to a point or to a closed finite surface that possibly encloses a monopole charge  @xmath61 .",
    "therefore  @xmath63 , which must be an integer multiple of  @xmath62 .",
    "the quantization of  @xmath61 follows .",
    "this argument is , however , unable to provide a method to compute the charge .",
    "one usually has to explicitly compute the integral ( [ eq : flux ] ) ( using ( [ eq : b ] ) for the magnetic field ) over a sphere enclosing the degeneracy . in the case of a conical contact ,",
    "the structure of the integral is transparent : @xmath64 is half the solid angle subtended from the origin by @xmath65 .",
    "however , for an arbitrary contact point in the presence of additional constraints @xmath64 is a complicated function of the polar and azimuthal angles .",
    "the structure of the two - dimensional integral is therefore non - trivial and in general difficult to compute .",
    "it obscures moreover the simplicity of the result ( an integer multiple of @xmath66 ) .    rather than the magnetic field  @xmath2 , from now on we work with the potential  @xmath37 .",
    "as we will show , the 2d - flux integral across the sphere is replaced by one or several 1d - circulation integrals .",
    "this scheme leads to a general and simple rule for calculating the charge that explicitly exhibits the quantization .    when the number of constraints  @xmath51 is finite , the subset in  @xmath8 defined by  @xmath27 is the union of the algebraic curves defined near  @xmath9 by the first non - vanishing terms of the taylor expansion of * _ e_*. the expected `` pathologies '' of this subset are intersections of the curves at  @xmath9 .",
    "when the conditions  @xmath28 and  @xmath29  that define the dirac strings  @xmath25 and  @xmath26  are added , the number of curves can possibly be reduced by half . in a small enough neighborhood of  @xmath9 ,",
    "@xmath25 and  @xmath26 are made of sets of half curves starting at the origin .",
    "locally one can not determine if a given couple of half strings belongs to the same algebraic curve or not .",
    "we also stress that it is the choice of gauge which fixes  @xmath25 . adding a gradient to  @xmath37 will not change the value of  @xmath1 but can modify  @xmath25 significantly by changing the position and the number of half strings .",
    "what really matters is the algebraic sum of the flux they carry . to illustrate this point",
    ", a useful gauge transformation is to make a rotation  @xmath67 on  @xmath52 : if  @xmath68 denotes a unitary representation of  so(3 ) in the bidimensional hilbert subspace , the relation @xmath69^\\dagger\\,\\text{\\bfseries\\itshape e}\\,.\\,\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,u(\\mathsf{r } ) = \\mathsf{r}(\\text{\\bfseries\\itshape e})\\,.\\,\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\;,\\ ] ] together with  ( [ def : h ] ) , implies that such a rotation corresponds to a unitary transform of the eigenvectors of  @xmath22 and hence will not affect the phases .",
    "yet a simple permutation of the components of  @xmath70 can change  @xmath25 drastically .",
    "for example , a rotation by  @xmath71 about  @xmath72 changes the sign of  @xmath73 without modifying  @xmath74 and  @xmath75 .",
    "one can therefore exchange  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 .",
    "it is moreover not excluded that a gauge transformation that considerably simplifies the sets  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 exists in general , by reducing them for example to a single half dirac string .",
    "but no general rule for constructing such a gauge transformation is available .    from now on",
    "we fix the gauge according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) .",
    "@xmath35 is chosen to be a surface which is diffeomorphic to a sphere centered at  @xmath9 but pierced with  @xmath76 holes at the level of the strings contained in  @xmath25 .",
    "we denote  @xmath77 the ( oriented ) boundary of the  @xmath78th hole .",
    "it is a small loop of typical radius  @xmath79 that encircles the  @xmath78th half string .",
    "then the integration contour in  ( [ eq : circulation ] ) reduces simply to  @xmath80 ( see figure  [ fig : diracstrings ] ) .    since @xmath0 can be taken arbitrarily close to  @xmath25 , and not intersecting  @xmath26 , we have @xmath81 from this it follows that @xmath82 where @xmath83 @xmath84 has a natural topological interpretation .",
    "it is the algebraic winding number of the complex number @xmath85 when  @xmath17 traverses  @xmath77 .",
    "it is a well defined quantity : @xmath86 never crosses zero because  @xmath17 never touches  @xmath23 .",
    "( [ g ] ) yields an alternative interpretation of the charge as a sum of winding numbers associated to the dirac strings .",
    "it also provides a method to compute the charge , or to generate arbitrary values .",
    "we end up by illustrating the procedure with several examples ( the generic case of section  [ sec : genericcase ] is similar to the second one ) . in all the cases described below",
    ", we will taylor expand  @xmath52 near the origin and suppose that the terms that we explicitly retain are sufficient to fix the local geometry of  @xmath23 completely .      consider a case where in a suitable choice of coordinates we have , @xmath87+\\text{higher order terms}\\;.\\ ] ]",
    "it follows immediately that  @xmath88 so that @xmath89 . to illustrate the importance of the gauge",
    ", we now treat the same example but in a gauge that exchanges  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath26 is made of four half branches of parabolae : @xmath90\\bigr\\}$ ] .",
    "close enough to  @xmath9 they can be assimilated to their tangent , i.e. the two axes @xmath91 .",
    "the surface  @xmath35 looks topologically like the one in figure  [ fig : example ] .",

    "@xmath93 runs from @xmath94 to @xmath62 , whereas @xmath95 and  @xmath96 are fixed and small strictly positive quantities measuring the distance to the origin and the radius of the loops , respectively . from the definitions  ( [ def : ez ] ) and  ( [ def : be1 ] ) we get @xmath97 + o(\\delta^2)$ ] .",
    "@xmath98 describes ( a small perturbation of ) an ellipse centered at the origin whose great axis is the segment @xmath99 $ ] and whose width is proportional to  @xmath95 .",

    "this provides an explicit example of a monopole carrying an arbitrarily large charge , and therefore creating arbitrarily large phase shifts for a loop located close to the degeneracy in parameter space .",
    "the contact between energy surfaces with @xmath124 is illustrated in part ( a ) of figure [ fig : contacts ] , which is identical to the geometry of the contact defined by eq.([def : be2 ] ) with @xmath103 ( up to an irrelevant scaling factor ) .",
    "spectral degeneracies with charges higher than one have been observed in several contexts .",
    "for instance , via the variations of chern numbers in quantum systems with mixed and chaotic classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "these integer topological invariants measure the transport ( hall conductivity ) of each band of a doubly periodic system .",
    "values of @xmath125 and @xmath126 were found ( cf in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite the contact points at @xmath127 between the second and third levels , and at @xmath128 between the fourth and fifth levels , respectively ) .",
    "a closer analysis of the geometry of the contact points reveals that these two degeneracies coincide with the parabolic and cubic contacts described by eq.([chebye ] ) with @xmath124 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "for instance , the @xmath125 contact is parabolic in the bloch angles and linear in the parameter @xmath129 .",
    "we have also exhibited the possibility of having a contact point with total charge equal to zero .",
    "although its presence will in general be difficult to detect , it would be interesting to find an explicit quantum mechanical model displaying this curious feature .    in the electromagnetic analogy based on the general formula ,",
    "the `` sources '' of the geometric phase in parameter space are the spectral degeneracies plus some additional currents not related to them . in the particular ( and generic ) case of a diabolical contact ,",
    "the contribution of the degeneracy is simple : it acts as a pure monopole charge , thus contributing to @xmath59 but not to @xmath130 .",
    "however , for an arbitrary contact point  defined by eq.([eq : b ] )  the situation is different . on the one hand ,",
    "the divergence of @xmath2 is not simply determined by a charge , but more generally by a _ charge distribution _ ( cf eq.([eq : divexpansion ] ) ) .",
    "the latter can contain higher multipole moments . moreover , the @xmath131 of @xmath2 need not be zero . in the present study , we have only considered a particular aspect of the sources of geometric phase associated to the field produced by a degeneracy , namely the total charge of the distribution .",
    "a more complete classification scheme is clearly needed .",
