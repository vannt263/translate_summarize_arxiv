    "the noise performance of an active device up to millimeter - wave frequencies plays a basic role in evaluating the suitability of the latter for low - noise applications in advanced telecommunication , nuclear instrumentation and radio astronomy applications .",
    "this aspect is gaining increasing importance also due to the implementation of nanometer scale devices where a higher degree of interaction among the intrinsic noise sources is expected to affect the device noise behavior @xcite .",
    "so far , the noise analysis approaches and the relevant modelling tools employ the representation based on a second order statistics for all the noise sources located inside a transistor @xcite .",
    "this allows to manage the analytical problems and leads to satisfactory results within the 20 ghz range for device dimensions not aggressively scaled , as for example fet s with gate length not smaller than 0.2 @xmath0 m .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new approach to the problem starting from a general description of all noise sources and solving the stochastic integral equation associated to the equivalent circuit of the microwave device @xcite . from the time waveform of the output voltage",
    "we obtain the noise figure @xmath1 as a function of the operating frequency .",
    "the noise figure , which is the link between microscopic noise characteristics and macroscopic ( i.e. measurable ) parameters @xcite , is calculated by the ratio of the spectral noise power density produced at the output of the noisy device to the spectral noise power density produced at the output of the ideal noiseless device .",
    "more specifically , our calculation were performed for a noise source impedance of 50 @xmath2 , but the procedure can be applied for arbitrary impedance value .",
    "we determine the device noise figure @xmath3 at different discrete frequencies over a given operating range .",
    "then , we compare the values of @xmath3 calculated by means the proposed method with data referring to characterization of an hemt transistor series ( ne20283a , by nec ) from 6 to 18 ghz at a low noise bias point @xcite .",
    "the proposed procedure exhibits fairly good accuracy , within the typical uncertainty range of any experimental determination .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that for gaussian statistics the conventional cad tools and our approach coincide .",
    "however for non - gaussian noise sources , i.e. when it is important to know higher order statistics , our noise modelling is appropriate .",
    "in fact with our approach we can use different statistics of the noise sources and therefore obtain all the moments of the output voltage as a function of the cross - correlation functions of the noise sources .",
    "this technique can thus be applied to extract all the information required for a complete knowledge of the noise performance of the device without any restriction on the statistics of the noise sources , including also cross - correlated noise sources .",
    "high electron mobility transistors ( hemt ) are gaas or in - based field - effect transistors for application at microwave and millimeter wave frequencies .",
    "these devices began to set records for noise performance since their introduction in the early 90s and therefore represent key elements in all low - noise circuits .",
    "the linear equivalent circuit which typically models the small - signal performance of hemt s at microwave frequencies is shown in fig .",
    "1 . this circuit represents the chip device because access inductances and parasitic intererelectrode capacitances are not included .",
    "the values of the circuit elements are usually determined by computer - aided modelling procedures which may follow either optimization - based or direct extraction criteria @xcite .",
    "more recently , approaches based on artificial neural networks have been successfully employed @xcite .",
    "we had previously characterized an hemt transistor series ( ne20283a , by nec ) over the @xmath4 ghz frequency range at the low noise bias conditions suggested by the manufacturer ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) . by microwave measurements",
    ", we determined both the scattering and the noise parameters of the packaged device , i.e. the device sealed within a ceramic enclosure equipped with metallic leads . from the experimental data , we extracted a linear noisy model for the whole structure by a variable decomposition approach with a separate tuning for the channel noise source value modelled by an equivalent noise temperature assigned to the @xmath7 resistor @xcite .",
    "the values of the circuit elements and the noise temperature @xmath8 so obtained are listed in tab . 1 .",
    ".values of circuit elements of the chip hemt model at @xmath5 and @xmath9 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     all the other resistors in the model contribute with thermal noise typical of equilibrium conditions with device environment ( i.e. @xmath10 ) .",
    "the comparison between the noise parameters measured and modelled for the packaged device data was presented in @xcite .",
    "we here report for the reader s convenience the plot of the noise figure in input matched condition in fig .",
    "2 . to carry out our analysis we employ the model structure representing the chip device so eliminating the effect of the package found to be lossless ( i.e. not containing noise sources ) . among all noise parameters we use the @xmath3 noise figure as information test to check the effectiveness of the procedure here presented",
    "therefore , the new results are compared with @xmath3 data referring to the chip as simulated via cad by use of the above circuit model .",
    "for the sake of simplicity and to validate our theoretical approach we suppose that all noise sources in the hemt model are gaussian white noise of thermal origin with zero mean , @xmath11-correlated and variance per unit of frequency bandwidth equal to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath14 the resistance and @xmath15 the equivalent temperature of the resistor . no correlation is assumed among the noise sources .",
    "the noise voltage generator @xmath16 is the thermal noise associated with the real part of the impedance @xmath17 of the input termination at the reference temperature @xmath18 , which is the standard temperature to determine the noise figure .",
    "the resistances @xmath19 and @xmath7 contribute to noise by assigning equivalent temperature @xmath20 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the temperature of the intrinsic gate - source resistance @xmath19 is assumed to be equal to the environment temperature ( @xmath21 ) @xcite . in order to determine the expression of the output noise voltage @xmath22 as a function of the noise sources ,",
    "the circuit network is analyzed in the laplace domain .",
    "so that we have the laplace transform of the zero - state ( at @xmath23 ) response of the output voltage    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is a complex variable , @xmath26 are the transfer functions from the i - th noise generator to the output , and @xmath27 are the laplace transforms of the voltage generators with the following notation : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in the equivalent circuit of the hemt ,",
    "the small - signal @xmath34 transconductance depends on the variable @xmath25 as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the dc value of the transconductance and @xmath37 is the transit time of the carriers to diffuse from source to drain . since the value of @xmath37 is a fraction of picosecond , and we are interested in investigating the frequency range below @xmath38 ghz , where @xmath39 , we approximate the exponential function as @xmath40 .",
    "consequently the @xmath26 are rational functions of the complex variable @xmath25 . by anti - transforming ( [ laplace ] ) , we obtain the zero - state response of the output voltage in the time domain which assume the expression valid for @xmath41    @xmath42    where the function @xmath43 are the impulse responses corresponding to the @xmath26 , which assume the expression    @xmath44    here @xmath45 is the dirac @xmath11-function .",

    "the following inequalities are satisfied    @xmath48    thus the relation ( [ rispimp ] ) can be approximated as : @xmath49    by using eqs .",

    "it gives the stochastic output voltage of the hemt device as a function of the different stochastic processes which represent the noise sources . by inserting the different statistics of the noise sources in eq.(6 )",
    "we can extract all the moments of the output voltage @xmath52 required for a complete knowledge of the noise performance when higher order statistics occurs in the output signal of the devices .",
    "as an example we report in appendix b the expression of the second moment and the general expression of the n__th _ _ moment of the output voltage as a function of the cross - correlation functions of the noise sources . as a first step of investigations and to validate our stochastic approach we consider all noise generators @xmath53 present in the model as uncorrelated gaussian white noises , with the usual statistical properties : @xmath54 and @xmath55 . here",

    "the comparison between the continuous and the discrete transfer function is shown in fig .",

    "we use @xmath73 , with @xmath74 integer , and @xmath75 is the nyquist frequency . as @xmath74 increases , the difference between continuous and the approximate impulse response becomes negligible . at @xmath76 the error introduced by the fir impulse response are less than 1% .",

    "the nyquist frequency is 0.898 thz , thus @xmath80 points are needed at least to investigate the microwave frequency range .",

    "the results obtained with the stochastic approach may be improved by averaging over a greater number of realizations but with more computer time consuming .",
    "we note that the noise figure behavior obtained with the stochastic approach could be thought as the output of a noise figure measuring instrument where averaging and smoothing options are available to minimize display jitter .",
    "the procedure here described can be used with any input termination value to obtain more than one noise figure value . by choosing four different termination values ,",

    "is obtained from a circuit point of view .",
    "the noise parameters can be employed either for extraction of device intrinsic noise sources or for cad of low - noise circuits .",
    "we have presented a noise analysis procedure for microwave transistors .",
    "this procedure is based on langevin approach and takes the general statistical properties of the internal noise sources into account .",
    "the device is represented by its equivalent circuit with noise generators to a chip level .",
    "the noise figure at a given input termination is determined by first integrating the noise voltage equations in the time domain and by transforming them into spectral power densities over the frequency range of interest .",

    "the proposed procedure exhibits good accuracy within the typical uncertainty range of any experimental determination .",
