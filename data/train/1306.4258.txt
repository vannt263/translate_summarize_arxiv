    "finally , we conclude our study in  6 .",
    "the computations in this paper are preformed with the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamic code , flash @xcite .",
    "we use the directionally split eulerian version of the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) @xcite , which provides a formally second - order accuracy in both space and time . to avoid an odd - even instability ( decoupling ) @xcite that can arise from shocks that are aligned with a grid ,",
    "we adopt a hybrid riemann solver which switches to an elle solver inside shocks .",
    "amr is implemented using the paramesh package @xcite .",
    "we employ an error estimator based on @xcite adopted originally in paramesh package for the refinement criteria . for the refinement ,",
    "the density , pressure , velocity , and mass fractions of nickel , oxygen , helium , and hydrogen are selected . in our computations ,",
    "the two - dimensional axisymmetric spherical coordinate ( @xmath13,@xmath23 ) is adopted .",
    "the initial computational domain covers the region of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the initial radius of the outer boundary corresponds to the inner part of the oxygen - rich layer of a pre - supernova star .",
    "the pre - supernova model used in this paper will be described below .",
    "the numbers of grid points of the base level ( level 1 ) are set to be 48(@xmath13 ) @xmath19 12(@xmath23 ) .",
    "the maximum refinement level is set to be 7 .",
    "therefore , the effective maximum numbers of grid points are 3072(@xmath13 ) @xmath19 768(@xmath23 ) .",
    "the minimum effective cell sizes are approximately 10 km and 0.23 degree in the radial and @xmath23 directions , respectively .    to follow large physical scales from the onset of a explosion to the shock breakout , we extend gradually the computational domain as the forward shock propagates outward and remap the physical values in new domains .",
    "if the forward shock reaches close to the radial outer boundary , the radial size of the computational region is extended by a factor of 1.2 .",
    "if the radius of the inner boundary becomes less than 1% of that of the outer boundary , the radius of the inner boundary is also expanded by keeping to be 1% of that of the outer boundary to prevent the time steps from becoming too small due to the courant - friedrichs - levy ( cfl ) condition . in particular , the propagation of an acoustic wave in the @xmath23 direction in a time step is restricted severely due to the cfl condition .",
    "the physical values of the extended region are set to be the values of the pre - supernova model .",
    "the propagation of the forward shock is basically supersonic , which allows us to adopt such a prescription .",
    "the radius of the surface of the pre - supernova star is about 3.4 @xmath19 10@xmath26 cm .",
    "therefore , about 40 remappings are required to cover the whole star .",
    "note that in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) similar to the present paper , the factors of expansions are roughly between 2 and 3 .",
    "however , we found that if we adopt a factor of 2 , the hydrodynamic values of the inner part tend to be diffusive due to remapping especially in the accelerating phases of shocks .",
    "additionally , the factor of 1.2 has an advantage of extending time steps efficiently owing to the more frequent expansions of grids . to see",
    "whether such procedures introduce a significant artifact in our computations , we check the conservation of the total mass .",
    "we confirm that the errors due to each remapping are ranged between 10@xmath27 and 10@xmath28 .",
    "therefore , 40 remappings may not introduce errors above a factor of 10@xmath7 for global values at a maximum .",
    "note that although the maximum refinement level is constant through a simulation , successive remappings enlarge gradually the effective minimum grid size as the computational domain is extended . in the remapping procedures",
    ", we use a monotonic cubic interpolation scheme @xcite for interpolations of physical values .",
    "the computational cost is approximately 10,000 cpu hr for each model in the present paper .    at the start of the simulation ,",
    "a ` reflection ' boundary condition is employed for the radial inner boundary .",
    "after the forward shock has reached the composition interface of c+o / he ( corresponds to the radius of 6 @xmath19 10@xmath29 cm ) , it is switched to a ` diode ' boundary condition that allows matter to flow out of the computational domain but inhibits matter from entering the computational domain through the inner boundary in order to include the effects of fallback of matter .",
    "if we use the ` diode ' boundary condition for the radial inner boundary throughout the whole simulation , we may overestimate the fallback of matter . as we will show later",
    ", explosions are initiated by injecting kinetic and thermal energies artificially around the inner boundary . in the case of the ` diode ' boundary condition",
    ", a significant part of matter immediately above the inner boundary falls into the central object through the inner boundary at the initiation of the explosion .",
    "since such a situation does not match our intention , we adopt the ` reflection ' boundary condition initially .",
    "although changing the timing of the switch can somewhat affect the degree of the fallback of the innermost matter , we fix the timing of the switch by making sure that the mass of @xmath1ni remained in the computational domain does not become too small compared with that for sn  1987a ( @xmath6 0.07 @xmath0 : e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that if the ` diode ' boundary condition is used through the simulation , the mass of @xmath1ni is approximately 1 @xmath19 10@xmath30 in model sp1 ( see  3 for the description of models ) .",
    "the maximum velocity of @xmath1ni is also affected by the boundary condition .",
    "if the ` diode ' boundary condition is used through the simulation , the maximum velocity of @xmath1ni becomes half in model sp1 .",
    "however , we confirm that the timing of the switch does not affect the obtained maximum velocity of @xmath1ni much .",
    "if we change the corresponding radius of the timing of the switch to 3 @xmath19 10@xmath29 cm and 1.2 @xmath19 10@xmath31 cm , the obtained maximum velocities of @xmath1ni are same as in the case of the radius of 6 @xmath19 10@xmath29 cm ( 1,600 km s@xmath3 in model sp1 ) within the accuracy of 100 km s@xmath3 ( see  4.1 for the definition of the maximum velocity of @xmath1ni ) .",
    "we fix the other boundary conditions throughout the whole simulations .",
    "the ` reflection ' and ` diode ' boundary conditions are employed for the edges in @xmath23 direction and the radial outer boundary , respectively .",
    "we have included the effects of gravity in our computations as follows .",
    "since it takes much time to solve correctly the poisson equation for self - gravity , we adopt a spherically symmetric approximation for gravity .",
    "spherical density profiles are calculated by averaging the values in the @xmath23-direction and local gravitational potentials are estimated from enclosed masses at each radius .",
    "point source gravity from the mass inside the radial inner boundary is also included .",

    "the maximum temperature reached in the simulations is roughly 10@xmath31 k , and in such high temperature ( @xmath2 5@xmath4510@xmath29 k ) , nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) is established",
    ". thus the time scales of nuclear burning can be much smaller than that of the hydrodynamics . in the paper",
    ", we do not intend to focus on the effects of the feedback of nuclear reactions .",
    "therefore , we do not impose a time step limiter for the coupling of nuclear burning with hydrodynamics to save computational time .",
    "hence , the obtained mass fractions of e.g. , @xmath1ni may be overestimated . additionally , since we use the small nuclear reaction network including only 19 nuclei , neutron - rich matter is eliminated and can not be calculated . in our models ,",

    "generally , the mass cut is determined so that the mass of @xmath1ni in the ejecta is consistent with the observed one .",

    "the shape of the aspherical mass cut could be aspherical due to an aspherical explosion .",

    "from the estimations in this section , we conclude that the effects of the mass cut on the results are not much large unless the total mass of @xmath1ni is too overestimated .",
    "as mentioned in  3.4 , an aspherical explosion has been thought to be the one of promising triggers of neutron star ( ns ) kicks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the recoil velocity of a compact remnant ( neutron star ) can be estimated simply considering the momentum conservation .",
    "initially , the total momentum of the progenitor is zero in the frame of the center of gravity ( i.e. , the center of the progenitor ) .",
    "then , the neutron star recoil velocity is given by @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the total momentum outside the neutron star and @xmath160 is the mass of the neutron star .",
    "@xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) is the radius of the inner ( outer ) boundary .",
    "we regard simply the mass of the neutron star @xmath160 as the mass inside the inner boundary .",
    "we estimate the recoil velocity of the compact remnant for model am2 .",
    "note that since our simulations are axisymmetric , only @xmath126-component has the non - zero value .",
    "the obtained neutron star velocity at the end of simulation time is @xmath163 km s@xmath3 .",
    "since the sign is negative , the nascent neutron star is kicked in the opposite to stronger explosion direction",
    ". the averaged observed values of young pulsars are several hundred km s@xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and some of them have over 500 km s@xmath3 , even 1,000 km s@xmath3 @xcite . therefore , the estimated value is within the observational values but it is somewhat larger than that of a typical one . in our estimation",
    "the values of @xmath161 is rather larger than the surface radius of the compact remnant .",
    "therefore , the estimated value may have large uncertainty .",
    "hence , it is safe to say that our estimation includes uncertainty of several tens of % or more",
    ". nonetheless , the estimated value may be within the observed range . from the analysis ,",
    "the asymmetry roughly represented by @xmath110 , @xmath164 2 may be sufficient to explain the observed velocities of young pulsars . for a typical velocity of young pulsars ,",
    "@xmath165 2 may be preferable .",
    "for sn  1987a , the compact remnant has not been found so far .",
    "however , if the explosion is stronger in some direction , the nascent neutron star will be kicked in the opposite to the strongest explosion direction as discussed above .",
    "actually , the observed line profiles of [ fe ii ] as a function of doppler velocity for sn  1987a are asymmetric across the null velocity point .",
    "the peak is located in the red - shifted side @xcite .",
    "it is commonly known that the images of sn  1987a have three rings .",
    "the inner ring is inclined at about 45@xmath122 to the sky , and the north ( south ) part of the ring is closer to ( away from ) us and blue - sifted ( red - shifted ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , recent near infrared spectroscopic observations have revealed that the inner ejecta of sn  1987a is elongated and it is roughly confined to the same plane as the inner ring @xcite . from above considerations , we can speculate the direction of the velocity of the compact remnant of sn  1987a .",
    "the south part of the explosion of sn  1987a is stronger than the north part of it because the south part of inner ejecta is red - shifted and the line profile of [ fe ii ] in sn  1987a implies that the explosion is stronger in the red - shifted side .",
    "therefore , the compact remnant of sn  1987a may be kicked in a northern direction .",
    "it should be noted that a similar discussion have been done by @xcite but the conclusion is opposite to ours .",
    "this may be because at that time , it had been thought that the explosion of sn  1987a had been a jetlike or bipolar and the north part of the inner ejecta of sn  1987a had been red - shifted @xcite .",
    "however , as noted above , recent observations contradict it .",
    "the observed features of line profiles of [ fe ii ] in sn  1987a have not been excellently reproduced by not only our models but also recent previous studies with a neutrino - driven model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is one of remained enigmas to be explained in the future .",
    "if the line profiles are reproduced by a more sophisticated model , it will be a good diagnostic to speculate the direction and magnitude of the recoil velocity of the compact remnant of sn  1987a .",
    "in this section , we consider the limitation of our simulations in the present paper and some possible ingredients to convey @xmath1ni into higher velocity regions .",
    "self - gravity is implemented in our code assuming the spherical symmetry to save cpu time .",
    "however , as we have seen in previous sections , the distributions of density and mass fractions of metals are rather anisotropic and self - gravity due to anisotropic matter distributions could potentially affect the fallback and protrusions of innermost metals .",
    "hence , it is desirable that the poisson equation for self - gravity is solved in more sophisticated manner including multi - dimensional effects . additionally ,",
    "if matter distributions are changed from the results in the paper , it could affect the estimation of the recoil velocity of the nascent neutron star .",
    "energy depositions due to decays of radioactive nuclei @xmath1ni and @xmath1co are the one of possible mechanisms to accelerate innermost metals including @xmath1ni in later phases after the shock breakout .",
    "if we assume the ejected mass of @xmath1ni is 0.07 @xmath0 , the total released energy estimated by equations ( [ eq : ni ] ) and ( [ eq : co ] ) reaches @xmath1661.3 @xmath19 10@xmath167 erg 400 day after the explosion . in our models ,",
    "the radial velocity of @xmath1ni is clustered around 1,000 km s@xmath3 at the ends of simulation time .",
    "hence , the kinetic energy of bulk @xmath1ni is roughly estimated as @xmath168 therefore , if we assume that all the released energy from decaying @xmath1ni and @xmath1co is converted to the kinetic energy of itself , it becomes eight times larger than that before the heating , which corresponds to a threefold increase in velocity .",
    "of course , part of the gamma - rays from the metals may escape without heating and the estimation of equation ( [ eq : ekin ] ) may have a large uncertainty .",
    "then , the above estimation is kind of the upper bound .",
    "nonetheless , the peak velocity of the @xmath1ni could increase by about 30% due to decays of @xmath1ni and @xmath1co @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , the heating due to the decay of @xmath1ni and @xmath1co could be the seed of perturbations in a later phase , i.e. , ` nickel bubble ' .",
    "for sn 1987a , if 10% of @xmath1ni ( @xmath6 0.007@xmath0 ) had @xmath6 1,800 km s@xmath3 at the stage of @xmath6 10@xmath33 s after the explosion , the velocity of @xmath1ni of @xmath6 3,000 km s@xmath3 could be explained @xcite .",
    "our simulations are stopped just after the shock breakout due to the limitation of time . however , in order to determine the final velocity of @xmath1ni , more long term simulations are required .",

    "the authors insisted that in two - dimensional simulations , the motion of a clump is severely restricted to keep the ` torus'-like structure due to the axisymmetric assumption , and the drag force to the clump becomes larger as the distance of the clump from the polar axis becomes larger .",

    "<S> we perform two - dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of matter mixing in aspherical core - collapse supernova explosions of a 16.3 @xmath0 star with a compact hydrogen envelope </S>",
    "<S> . observations of sn  1987a have provided evidence that @xmath1ni synthesized by explosive nucleosynthesis is mixed into fast moving matter ( @xmath2 3,500 km s@xmath3 ) in the exploding star . in order to clarify the key conditions for reproducing such high velocity of @xmath1ni , we revisit matter mixing in aspherical core - collapse supernova explosions . </S>",
    "<S> explosions are initiated artificially by injecting thermal and kinetic energies around the interface between the iron core and the silicon - rich layer . </S>",
    "<S> perturbations of 5% or 30% amplitude in the radial velocities are introduced at several points in time . </S>",
    "<S> we found that no high velocity @xmath1ni can be obtained if we consider bipolar explosions with perturbations ( 5% amplitude ) of pre - supernova origins . </S>",
    "<S> if large perturbations ( 30% amplitude ) are introduced or exist due to some unknown mechanism in a later phase just before the shock wave reaches the hydrogen envelope , @xmath1ni with a velocity of 3,000 km s@xmath3 can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> aspherical explosions that are asymmetric across the equatorial plane with clumpy structures in the initial shock waves are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the clump sizes affect the penetration of @xmath1ni . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we report that an aspherical explosion model that is asymmetric across the equatorial plane with multiple perturbations of pre - supernova origins can cause the penetration of @xmath1ni clumps into fast moving matter of 3,000 km s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both aspherical explosion with clumpy structures and perturbations of pre - supernova origins may be necessary to reproduce the observed high velocity of @xmath1ni . to confirm this , </S>",
    "<S> more robust three - dimensional simulations are required . </S>"
