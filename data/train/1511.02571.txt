    "experiments at rhic and lhc have firmly established that the quark - gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions approaches local equilibrium rapidly , at a rate which allows for successful hydrodynamical descriptions of the parton phase despite its short lifetime of some fm / c .",
    "it seems reasonable to consider that this approach to equilibrium is initially dominated by binary collisions of partons @xcite .",
    "if indeed gluon number changing processes can not keep up with the fast kinetic equilibration , the quark - gluon plasma might exit sufficiently long in a _ transient _ quasi - equilibrium state that is characterized not only by local temperature , collective flow velocity and quark chemical potential(s ) , but also by a non - zero _ gluon _ chemical potential @xmath1 , quantifying that the gluon phase space density has not yet reached the asymptotic bose distribution with @xmath2 . as a consequence thereof",
    ", it has been argued that the high gluon occupation in the initial state , which can be described as a color glass condensate , may lead to the formation of a gluonic bose - einstein condensate in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "here we will put forward another noteworthy implication of this _ transient _ quasi - equilibrium phase with gluon overpopulation . in a thermal medium massless partons acquire a dynamical mass @xmath3 , which is a key mechanism to understand thermodynamic properties of the strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma , see e.g.  @xcite . in the present context",
    "it implies that the chemical potential @xmath4 , which must be smaller than the minimal energy of the dressed gluons @xmath5 , can be positive ( opposed to @xmath6 assumed in @xcite , and in general in perturbative qcd ) .",
    "this _ dense and interacting _ phase at @xmath7 we dub * serried glue*.    . only with the dynamical gluon mass @xmath8 taken into account , the window for the serried glue phase opens between the under - occupied phase at @xmath9 and the bose - einstein condensate at @xmath10 = m$ ] .",
    "[ phasediagr schematic],width=283 ]",
    "in order to study the thermodynamic properties of the serried glue phase , we generalize a qcd quasiparticle model @xcite : in the _ fully _ equilibrated system , i.e.  at @xmath2 , dressed gluons can be approximated as quasiparticles with a temperature - dependent mass @xmath11 where g^2(t ) = b / ( ( t + t_s)/t_c ) ^2 [ g2 ] is an _ effective _ coupling , with @xmath12 for @xmath13 flavors .",
    "thermodynamic properties follow from the thermodynamic potential @xmath14 . for simplicity",
    "we focus here on the quenched limit , @xmath15 ; then the quasiparticle pressure is that of an ideal gas of bosons with mass @xmath16 and degeneracy @xmath17 , less a residual quasiparticle interaction contribution , p(t ) = p_id(t ; m(t ) ) - b(t ) . by thermodynamic consistency",
    ", @xmath18 is related to ( and can be obtained , up to an integration constant , from ) the quasiparticle mass @xmath16 by @xmath19 as consequence thereof , the entropy density takes a particularly simple form ( without a residual interaction term like in the pressure ) , viz .",
    "s(t ) = p(t)/t = s_id(t ; m(t ) ) .",
    "[ s ] after fixing the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 by matching to lattice qcd results @xcite , the scheme is fully specified and will provide the ` initial ' condition for a flow equation derived now .    for @xmath1 , both the quasiparticle mass and the pressure will depend on the chemical potential .",
    "similar to the entropy density ( ( [ s ] ) is now complemented by a @xmath4-dependence ) , we find the gluon particle density equal to the density of an ideal boson gas with @xmath22-dependent mass , n(t , ) = p(t,)/= n_id(t , ; m(t , ) ) .",
    "[ n ] obviously , as derivatives of @xmath23 , the entropy and particle density must satisfy maxwell s relation @xmath24 , which translates into a condition for the quasigluon mass @xmath25 , + a ( t , ; m(t , ) ) = 0 .",
    "[ flow eq ] this flow equation is similar to a relation derived in @xcite for the effective coupling @xmath26 in the quark - gluon plasma at finite _ quark _ chemical potential @xmath27 , which led to an early successful prediction of the curvature of the critical line to the hadronic phase in the @xmath28 phase diagram .",
    "we only mention ( without detailing it here ) that the expression @xmath29 in ( [ flow eq ] ) is a non - linear function of @xmath30 involving integrals of the gluon distribution @xmath31 - 1)^{-1}$ ] .",
    "note that nonetheless ( [ flow eq ] ) is a _ linear _ partial differential equation which can be readily solved by the _ method of characteristics _ ( with the ` initial ' condition @xmath32 obtained from fitting the usual @xmath33 lattice qcd results , as announced ) .",
    "we then notice immediately that with only derivatives of @xmath8 in the flow equation ( [ flow eq ] ) , i.e.  no summand term @xmath34 , the mass @xmath35 is _ constant _ along the characteristics .",
    "therefore , the characteristic line @xmath36 from a given ` initial ' point @xmath37 into the @xmath38 region is limited by @xmath39 .",
    "this upper bound @xmath40 is in fact reached ( with vanishing slope @xmath41 ) and earmarks the onset of bose - einstein condensation",
    ". the corresponding temperatures at the end points of the characteristic lines , which are needed to fully specify the condensate phase boundary @xmath42 , can be be calculated analytically in the weak - coupling limit or numerically from the flow equation ( [ flow eq ] ) . as a qualitative feature",
    "we point out that the inverse relation @xmath43 has two branches , see fig .",
    "[ charlines ]  an obvious result of the continuous mapping by the flow ( [ flow eq ] ) of the ` initial ' condition @xmath44 which is _ non - monotonous _ ( being the product of a decreasing and an increasing function ) .    ):",
    "the end points of the characteristics specify the boundary to the bose - einstein condensate ( dotted green line ) .",
    "the characteristic line @xmath45 from the ` critical point ' @xmath46 can be roughly related to the confinement phase boundary .",
    "note that the characteristics from a vicinity of @xmath0 intersect ( see dash - dotted orange line ) since the solution of ( [ flow eq ] ) is locally non - unique : @xmath35 develops a fold ( as explained in the text , this has no physics relevance ) .",
    "[ charlines],width=283 ]",
    "although bose - einstein condensation in heavy - ion collisions is certainly interesting , we focus here on another aspect .",
    "sufficient for our argument , and easy to show analytically from ( [ flow eq ] ) , is that the slope of the characteristics is negative . following @xcite and relating the characteristic line @xmath45 from the ` critical point ' @xmath46 to the phase boundary with the confined phase , we find that the confinement temperature @xmath47 decreases markedly with @xmath4 in the serried glue phase , see full red line in fig .",
    "[ charlines ] .    in this context",
    "we remark that for large effective coupling the solution of ( [ flow eq ] ) turns out to be multi - valued in a small region , indicated by characteristics from a small vicinity of @xmath0 intersecting each other , cf .",
    "[ charlines ] .",
    "however , this circumstance has no physical relevance since the pressure , when calculated ` along ' these descending characteristics , becomes negative ` before ' the solution of ( [ flow eq ] ) becomes non - unique .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] where @xmath48 is indicated by the dashed purple line  a ` conservative bound ' for the confinement transition occurring in fact at non - zero pressure ( i.e.  somewhat above the dashed line ) , which thus excludes seemingly ambiguous solutions of the flow equation.we recall a corresponding observation in case of the quark chemical potential @xcite .",
    "( indicated by the dashed purple line ) , hence the multi - valued solution of ( [ flow eq ] ) in a region below the dash - dotted orange line is irrelevant .",
    "[ phasediagram],width=370 ]    -5 mm    of interest for phenomenology are quantitative estimates of the magnitude of the expected effects . keeping in mind that for simplicity we are discussing here the quenched limit where @xmath49gev",
    ", we may expect a pure gluon plasma in the serried phase to exist down to temperatures of some @xmath50gev , if the gluon chemical potential reaches @xmath51 where bose - einstein condensation would set in .",
    "we remark that such a _",
    "` massive ' _ effect is not a surprise : massive bosons with chemical potential close to @xmath52 behave like non - relativistic particles , @xmath53 thus the ` bose divergence ' , @xmath54 for small @xmath55 , is enhanced compared to perturbatively massless gluons ( @xmath56 ) , which can over - compensate the suppression effects due to larger kinetic energy with a dynamical mass .    in conclusion",
    ", we propose a new phase ` serried glue ' in the qcd phase diagram . while we discussed here only the quenched limit , we expect also for the physical case the possibility of reaching temperatures significantly below the commonly assumed lowest value @xmath57gev , catalyzed by interacting ( i.e.  dressed ) gluons in over - occupied states @xcite .",
    "we consider this idea as reasonably robust insofar as it relies on the indubitable emergence of dynamical mass scales in the medium and the fundamental maxwell relation ( which governs not only the quasiparticle model used here , but also more sophisticated resummation approaches like @xcite ) .",
    "the only remaining assumption , the existence of a sufficiently long - lived transient equilibrium with approximately conserved gluon number , remains to be substantiated .",
    "if confirmed , the implications of a ` super - cool serried glue ' phase would be far - reaching for hydrodynamic simulations and thus for heavy - ion physics in general .",
