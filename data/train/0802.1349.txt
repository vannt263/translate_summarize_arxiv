    "the magellanic stream ( ms ) , a 10  wide tail of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) emanating from the magellanic clouds and trailing for almost 100  on the sky ( dec @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) @xcite , is the only clear example of a gaseous halo stream in the milky way s close proximity . while it is well accepted that the ms is the result of interactions between the milky way ( mw ) and the magellanic clouds , the relative importance of tidal stripping and various kinds of gasdynamical interactions is still very much under debate .",
    "most recently several new attempts were made to model the observed hi column density and velocity distribution as being due to purely tidal stripping @xcite , or gravitational @xmath5 hydrodynamical interactions @xcite .",
    "these models focus on reproducing general features in the magellanic system , and gradients in hi column density and velocity along the ms . to add more excitement to this topic , recent estimates of the proper motion of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) by @xcite and the most recent calculations of the magellanic cloud s orbits by @xcite suggest , contrary to all previous studies , that the clouds are only on their first passage around the mw .",
    "the new orbits imply that neither tidal nor ram pressure stripping would have had enough time to produce the ms , calling for alternative formation mechanisms .",
    "the distance to the ms , especially to its tip , or the region the farthest away from the magellanic clouds , is another contentious question and varies greatly between models . under the ram pressure hypothesis",
    "the tip has fallen the farthest toward the mw and is at a distance of only 25 kpc .",
    "early tidal models @xcite place the tip at a distance of 60 - 70 kpc .",
    "the latest tidal simulations @xcite find an even more distant component extending from 170 to 200 kpc .",
    "the latest orbit calculations @xcite would also imply a significantly large distance to the ms , @xmath6 kpc , although it is not clear where exactly the ms is relative to the clouds in this framework .    for many years",
    "the ms was viewed as a complex of six discrete concentrations ( labeled as ms i to vi ) .",
    "new hi parkes surveys by @xcite and @xcite , with an angular resolution of 15.5@xmath0 , revealed a more complex nature of the ms gas , with a fascinating network of filaments and clumps .",
    "two large spatial filaments were found to run in parallel over most of the ms length . around dec @xmath7",
    "the dual filaments disperse into many small clumps and filaments culminating in a chaotic appearance at the tip .",
    "the only high resolution view of two selected regions at the tip of the ms was by stanimirovic et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who used the arecibo telescope to image two small regions in ms v ( dec @xmath8 ) and ms vi ( dec @xmath9 ) .",
    "this work showed that the ms clumps have a complex morphology at 3.5@xmath0 resolution , strongly suggestive of interactions between the ms and an external medium . while most previous studies thought that the ms dissipates at",
    "its tip ( dec @xmath7 ) , very sensitive westerbork observations by @xcite suggested that the ms remarkably extends further to the north all the way to dec @xmath10 .",
    "another interesting phenomenon brought to light by the parkes surveys is the presence of numerous small hi clumps which surround the main ms filaments in position and velocity @xcite .",
    "while the origin of these clumps is still unclear , several possible mechanisms have been invoked : the clumpiness in the original gas drawn out of the magellanic clouds , the instabilities along the ms s edge , or dense condensations within an extended mainly ionized ms component .",
    "one of the crucial issues about the origin and structure of the ms in general , is to what extent interactions with the mw halo determine or influence the ms gas .",
    "this problem becomes particularly important at the extreme northern end of the ms , because this portion of the ms is considered to be the oldest and has been immersed in the hot mw halo for a long time .    in this paper we present results from the recent hi observations of the tip of the ms obtained with the arecibo telescope as part of the on - going survey by consortium for galactic studies with the arecibo l - band feed array ( galfa ) . in section 2",
    "we briefly outline our observing and data processing methods .",
    "section 3 describes several new filaments discovered at the tip of the ms , while in section 4 we present a statistical summary of properties of numerous hi clouds found in this region . in section 5",
    "we discuss the origin of the ms and its clumpy structure based on our observations and results .",
    "the observations were conducted with the arecibo telescope .",
    "galfa hi survey consists of many individual projects .",
    "the data presented in this paper represent a combination of three galfa projects : togs ( or ` turn - on galfa spectrometer ' being undertaken in parallel with the alfalfa extragalactic survey , pi : putman ) , a2172 ( pis : heiles & peek , whose original target was a shell - like structure at galactic velocities ) , and a2032 ( pi : stanimirovic , which observed a small region at the ms tip ) .",
    "as general galfa observing and data reduction strategies are summarized in @xcite , we emphasize here only a few important points .",
    "all observations were obtained with the dedicated spectrometer galspect which has a fixed velocity resolution of 0.18 . for a2032 and a2172 ,",
    "the telescope was driven in the basket - weave mode producing inter - woven zig - zag scans in the ra ",
    "dec coordinate frame . for togs , numerous drift scans along right ascension were made , as this is the preferred observing strategy for the alfalfa survey @xcite . before each observing scan about 5 minutes",
    "were spent running `` the least - squares frequency switching '' calibration procedure @xcite which allows us to derive a reference spectrum to be applied to all spectra within the given scan .",
    "we have then combined scans from togs ( the ` fall ' session ) and a2172 to obtain the data cube that covers a region @xmath11@xmath12  in size .",
    "various zig - zag and drift scans cross in many places .",
    "the crossing points were used to compare spectra and fine - tune our calibration .",
    "this procedure removes small gain offsets between adjucent drift scans and produces a resultant image mostly free of stripping artifacts . after this fine - tuning , spectra from the two projects",
    "were gridded into a data cube . in the case of a2032 observations",
    "our strategy was different .",
    "after basic calibration , we have produced an a2032 data cube , and then added it linearly ( in the image domain ) to the combined togs@xmath5a2172 cube .",
    "both combination processes worked very well .",
    "the images presented in this paper are the first demonstration of how successfully we can piece together data from different galfa projects .",
    "the only problem encountered during the data reduction is radio interference present is several togs scans at high negative lsr velocities .",
    "this interference affects all alfa beams , varies across a given scan , and is centered around 1422 mhz .",
    "it is caused by a still unidentified source .",
    "we have edited affected scans where possible , however some artifacts are still noticeable in several images .",
    "our future software developments will be better able to deal with this , and similar problems .    as the integration time was different for the three observing projects ,",
    "our sensitivity varies across the image .",
    "alfalfa and togs cover the sky twice with about 15 sec of integration time per beam , while a2172 and a2032 observations were obtained in a fast - scanning mode with an integration time of only about 5 sec per beam .",
    "declination bands from 11  to 16  and 24  to 28  have the lowest rms noise level , 0.03 k per 1.4  wide channels .",
    "the rest of the image is noisier , with about 0.06 - 0.07 k per 1.4  wide channels .",
    "our best 3-@xmath13 sensitivity is @xmath14 @xmath15 over 20 .",
    "figure  [ f : chans ] shows hi images from the final data cube at several selected velocities . in figure",
    "[ f : moments ] we show the first moment image , or the intensity - weighted velocity along the line - of - sight .",
    "the area covered in our observations is huge  about 870 square degrees ( @xmath16@xmath17 105 , @xmath18@xmath19 ) , focusing on the very tip of the ms where the two traditional ms filaments were found to be significantly spatially bifurcated ( one is located at ra 23@xmath20 30@xmath21 , and the other one at ra @xmath2223@xmath20 00@xmath21 ) .",
    "the only previous high resolution observations of about 10 square degrees within this region were obtained by stanimirovic et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    as figures  [ f : chans ] and",
    "[ f : moments ] show , several coherent hi filaments extend all the way to dec @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite reported an extension of the two ms filaments , in the form of diffuse gas , from dec = 20  to 40 .",
    "we confirm the continuous extension of the ms from dec = 5  to @xmath2225 . beyond this point",
    "our observations may not be sensitive enough to detect a very low - column - density emission found by @xcite .",
    "our sensitivity of @xmath24 @xmath15 ( over 20 ) is significantly worse than @xcite s lowest contour ( in their figure 5 ) shown at @xmath25 @xmath15 .",
    "however , the picture of the two interwoven filaments changes dramatically in our observations : instead of two traditional filaments we find several !",
    "while filaments often break into numerous branches and small clouds when viewed with arecibo s resolution , there are at least four prominent and coherent large - scale structures noticeable across the whole velocity range . to facilitate further discussion",
    "we define and label filaments in the following way . starting from the lowest negative velocities ( @xmath26 ) in figure  [ f : chans ] :    1 .   `",
    "s1 ' is centered at ra 23@xmath20 35@xmath21 , this is a portion of one of the two traditional ms filaments ; 2 .   `",
    "s2 ' is centered at ra 23@xmath20 10@xmath21 and can be traced through the whole velocity range ; 3 .   `",
    "s3 ' is centered at ra 23@xmath20 05@xmath21 and starts at a higher negative velocity of @xmath27 ; 4 .   `",
    "s4 ' starts at ra 23@xmath20 00@xmath21 and extends to ra 22@xmath20 35@xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ f : intensity_ann ] ( left ) shows a schematic representation of the four streams .",
    "both s1 and s4 can be seen from the lowest negative velocities up to about @xmath28 .",
    "s2 , s3 and s4 seem to have spatially a common point of origin , and are most likely related to the second traditional ms filament .",
    "the morphology of the four streams is significantly different : s2 , s3 and s4 consist of and are surrounded by numerous small , compact clumps , having a beads - on - string appearance .",
    "the number of compact clumps peaks at velocities @xmath29 to @xmath28 .",
    "s1 on the other hand has a more diffuse morphology and contains the smallest number of compact clumps .",
    "this may indicate that s1 has a different origin relative to the other three streams , or that it is younger and therefore did not have enough time to fragment .",
    "we get back to this issue in section  [ s : discussion ] .          while generally clumpy morphology is prominent , the four defined streams are coherent structures , which can be seen most clearly in the first moment image , figure  [ f : moments ] .",
    "all four streams show clear velocity gradients , although not all gradients are similarly steep . in figure",
    "[ f : cuts ] we show position ",
    "velocity images along the streams .",
    "s1 and s3 have a velocity gradient of about 5 deg@xmath30 over a length of 15 degrees , in agreement with the overall velocity gradient along most of the ms @xcite",
    ". s2 has the steepest gradient of almost 10 deg@xmath30 along the first 10 degrees , and then it almost turns over in velocity roughly staying around @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "s4 has almost a constant velocity of @xmath33 .",
    "all streams have a similar velocity dispersion , @xmath34 - 20 , see figure  [ f : intensity_ann ] ( right ) .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite who measured a dispersion of 15  along most of the ms .",
    "a striking result from the above figures is the presence of numerous small hi clouds .",
    "the smallest clouds have a size down to our resolution limit of 3.5@xmath0 and are unresolved .",
    "most of the clouds are compact and round , head - tail morphology is surprisingly uncommon .",
    "previously , @xcite noticed two types of clouds which surround the ms along its southern portion : head - tail clouds with tails pointing along the major axis of the ms ( typically , the head has a column density of @xmath35 @xmath15 while the tail is 3 - 4 times fainter ) , and ubiquitous dense hi clouds which follow the main ms filaments in position and velocity , some again with a head - tail morphology .      we have compiled a catalog of 180 hi clouds .",
    "the positions of all clouds are shown in figure  [ f : all_clouds ] .",
    "clouds were selected by eye from the spectral line data cube .",
    "the integrated intensity image was used as a guide for cloud selection , local peaks in this image were considered as potential cloud candidates .",
    "we then used the full data cube to follow potential clouds spatially and in velocity , and measure cloud properties .",
    "special care was taken to avoid breaking larger clouds into separate entities , however the catalog may still be slightly biased toward smaller clouds .",
    "we have made several checks to ensure cloud reliability and to exclude clouds potentially affected by scanning artifacts or rfi .",
    "there were several cases ( mainly at low dec ) where multiple clouds are present along the line - of - sight at clearly different velocities .",
    "these cases were treated as individual clouds .    for each cloud",
    "we have measured the cloud size , the central velocity , and the peak hi column density .",
    "in addition , at the center of each cloud we have fitted the hi velocity profile with one or two gaussian functions .",
    "although the cloud catalog is not 100% complete , as it is hard to select clouds in the regions with higher noise , it certainly represents well the cloud population whose physical properties we want to study .",
    "basic cloud properties are presented and discussed in the following sub - sections .    to ensure that we are dealing only with clouds of magellanic origin ,",
    "our cloud catalog was cross - correlated with the catalog of hvcs by @xcite , the catalog of hvcs and chvcs by @xcite , and the catalog of recently discovered mini - hvcs by @xcite .",
    "hvcs come with a wide range of sizes and properties . while some represent large complexes , like the ms , most are smaller with sizes of a few tens of degrees .",
    "on the other hand , chvcs represent a class of hvcs which are compact ( with sharp edges in the hi column density distribution ) , apparently isolated from larger complexes , and with angular size less that 2 .",
    "one interpretation is that chvcs are essentially the same as hvcs but located at much greater distances .",
    "recently discovered mini - hvcs are even smaller and have diameters of 9@xmath0 to 35@xmath0 .",
    "these clouds are also more diffuse than typical hvcs , having the peak hi column density of only @xmath24 @xmath15 .",
    "several of mini - hvcs were found to be superimposed on the northern extension ( dec @xmath36 ) of the ms but at velocities distinct from those of the ms gas .",
    "one suggestion is that these clouds represent outliers of the ms complex @xcite .",
    "there are 8 hvcs from @xcite in our field of view .",
    "three hvcs are clearly detected and identified as clouds in our catalog , these are wvw413 , wvw491 and wvw485 .",
    "additional three hvcs ( wvw508 , wvw492 and wvw472 ) have clouds nearby but at an angular separation larger than the beam of the leiden - dwingeloo survey .",
    "there are 19 hvcs and 3 chvcs from @xcite in our field of view .",
    "all of these chvcs were detected .",
    "as chvcs were classified as isolated clouds it will be surprising to find a large population of chvcs in our cloud catalog . only 3 chvcs from @xcite are in our field of view .",
    "chvc229 ( from de heij et al .",
    "2002 ) is extended and was found to be associated with several of our clouds at very low negative velocities ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we have excluded those hi clouds from our further analyses as at @xmath37  these clouds are clearly spatially located far away from the ms emission .",
    "three mini - hvcs are in our field of view : lmpu 387 - 230 , lmpu 387 - 275 , and lmpu 387 - 297 .",
    "lmpu 387 - 275 and lmpu 387 - 297 are at velocities ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ) where we detect several small clumps , the closest one being about 24@xmath0 away .",
    "we did not detect lmpu 387 - 230 however , although @xcite estimated its hi column density to be @xmath40 @xmath15 , clearly above our detection limit .    in summary",
    ", we do not find that our catalog is contaminated by a significant population of chvcs , it therefore contains primarily clouds associated with the ms .",

    "the observed cloud angular size distribution strongly peaks around 10@xmath0 .",
    "90% of clouds have a size in the range 3@xmath0 to 35@xmath0 .",
    "the abundance of very small , compact - looking clouds is significant , more than half of clouds in the catalog have an angular size less than 10@xmath0 .",
    "obviously , these clouds would have been missed in previous large - scale surveys such as the leiden - argentine - bonn ( lab ) survey @xcite , or even parkes surveys of the ms .",
    "the low - size cut - off of the histogram is clearly affected by our resolution limit of 3.5@xmath0 , and higher resolution observations will probably find many smaller clouds .",
    "the cloud central hi column density distribution peaks around @xmath46 @xmath15 , 90% range is @xmath47 to @xmath48 @xmath15 .",
    "this distribution function is affected by our sensitivity limit , deeper observations will probably find many clouds with lower hi column density . for comparison , the hi column density distribution of mini - hvcs peaks at @xmath24 @xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ f : dec_vel_more ] ( left ) shows that the number of clouds decreases steeply along the ms , in the direction toward the tip .",
    "the number of clouds in each latitude bin has been divided by the observed angular area to account for different areal coverage across the image .",
    "figure  [ f : dec_vel_more ] ( middle ) shows a tendency for clouds with angular size larger than 20@xmath0 to be found closer to the magellanic clouds ( at @xmath49 ) , while clouds with angular size less than 20@xmath0 appear along the whole latitude range .",
    "this could be interpreted as evidence that part of the ms with @xmath49  is at a larger distance , in agreement with tidal models .",
    "please note that the gap around @xmath50  on this plot is due to the lack of clouds , not due to the lack of data in this region . to provide an example of cloud linear size , hi mass , volume density , and thermal pressure",
    ", we use an angular diameter of 10@xmath0 and a median peak hi column density of @xmath46 @xmath15 , for three representative distance values , 20 , 60 , and 150 kpc , see table  [ table1 ] .",
    "interestingly , the cloud central velocity , shown in figure  [ f : cloud_histos ] ( right ) , shows a clear dichotomy .",
    "there are two peaks centered at @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with the velocity fwhm of 10 and 45 , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f : dec_vel_more ] ( right ) , the velocity dichotomy manifests in the way that there are two main groups of clouds , one around @xmath53  to @xmath54  ( or dec = 10 - 15 ) and @xmath55 , and the other one around @xmath56  to @xmath57  ( dec = 18 - 25 ) and @xmath58 .",
    "this figure also shows an almost continuous linear decrease in velocity ( from @xmath59 to @xmath60 ) with galactic latitude .",
    "this is in agreement with the general velocity trend along the ms .",
    "the observed velocity dichotomy may indicate a kinematic bifurcation of the ms tip .",
    "such bifurcation would not be surprising .",
    "n - body simulations by @xcite found two kinematically separate components , one that follows closely the orbit of the lmc and has a lower negative velocity , and the other one with a more negative velocity . while separated kinematically , both components occupy the same @xmath61 range .      about 20% of the clouds in our catalog have velocity profiles whose fitting requires two gaussian functions .",
    "this is indicative of the existence of a multi - phase medium .",
    "however , some of these velocity profiles could be due to the existence of multiple clouds along the line of sight , whose velocity profiles partially overlap . to account for this effect ,",
    "we accept as multi - phase clouds only those which have a subsonicly moving core and a warmer envelope .",
    "this criterion translates into the requirement that the absolute difference between the centers of the two fitted gaussian functions does not exceed @xmath62 the fwhm of the broad component .",
    "our final sample of multi - phase clouds contains 21 entries . as an example , in figure  [ f : some_clouds ] we show velocity profiles of ten multi - phase ( the first two rows ) , and five clouds with a single gaussian profile ( the last row ) . in most multi - phase cases ,",
    "a narrow gaussian component fits the line center , while a broader gaussian function is needed to fit the line wings .",
    "narrow line profiles were scarcely found in the ms in previous studies .",
    "@xcite found one cloud with a velocity fwhm of only 4 , at @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "@xcite used the lab survey and decomposed all hi velocity profiles into gaussian components .",
    "they found that the portion of the ms close to the magellanic clouds ( and with positive velocities ) has 27% of the sight lines with a narrow velocity component , while the portion further away from the clouds ( with negative velocities ) has a significantly lower fraction , only about 10% .",
    "the lower number of narrow components was attributed to either a lower halo pressure and/or a larger distance of the northern ms extension .",
    "our final fraction of multi - phase clouds ( 12% ) is similar to kalberla & haud s estimate for the negative velocity portion of the ms .",
    "figure  [ f : cloud_histos1 ] ( left ) shows the fwhm vs central velocity of all fitted gaussian functions : crosses correspond to clouds with a single gaussian component , while diamonds and circles represent the secondary ( or narrow ) and the primary ( or broad ) velocity component for clouds with multi - phase medium .",
    "the fwhm of single - component clouds is predominantly in the range of 2030 . for multi - phase clouds ,",
    "the fwhm of the narrow component has a broad , almost continuous , range from 3 to 20 , with a median value of 13 .",
    "this would imply an upper limit on the kinetic temperature in the range 2009000 k , mostly being in the thermally unstable regime .",
    "for comparison , @xcite find the fwhm of the narrow component in the range 528 .",
    "the fwhm of the broad component of multi - phase clouds is around 25 , in agreement with what is found for clouds with only a single gaussian component .",
    "the right panel in figure  [ f : cloud_histos1 ] shows the central velocities for both types of clouds .",
    "the velocity dichotomy is still noticeable with two peaks around @xmath65 and @xmath29 .",
    "this shows that the velocity bifurcation affects both clouds with and without multi - phase structure .",
    "we return to this point in section  [ s : distances ] .",
    "there are several important observational points presented in the previous sections :    * there are four coherent streams at the tip of the ms ; * s1 is diffuse , while s2 , s3 and s4 are clumpy ; * spatially , s2 , s3 and s4 appear to originate from a similar location ; * the velocity gradient along streams gradually decreases from s2 to s4 ; * there is a lack of large clouds at low galactic latitudes ; * central velocities of clouds with and without multi - phase structure show velocity bifurcation at @xmath29 and @xmath65 .    traditionally , it was assumed that the ms originated purely from the smc gas .",
    "@xcite suggested that the two double - helix - like ms filaments could arise from gas stripped from the magellanic bridge and the smc . by using the lab survey of galactic hi ( angular resolution of 0.6 ) ,",
    "@xcite were able to trace one of the two filaments all the way to an over - density region in the lmc .",
    "the only numerical study that addressed spatial bifurcation of the ms is by @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that gross features of the ms and the leading arm , as well as the spatial bifurcation of the main ms filament , can be reproduced purely by tidal interactions between the mw and the magellanic clouds .",
    "they also suggested that the main ms filament is broken into two kinematic components .",
    "several distinct features are found in their simulation .    1 .",
    "the main ms filament was created 1.5 gyr ago in a major encounter between the smc , the lmc , and the mw .",
    "further tidal ` kicks ' from encounters with the lmc 1.05 and 0.55 gyrs ago resulted in its spatial , and then kinematic bifurcation .",
    "while one of the bifurcated components follows the orbit of the magellanic clouds and has a lower negative velocity ( @xmath66 ) , the other possesses a higher negative velocity ( @xmath67 to @xmath32 ) .",
    "in addition to the main stream , which extends in distance from 60 to @xmath68 kpc , there is the third stream right at the tip which spatially coincides with the main stream but has distinct kinematics and is significantly further away ( distance of 170 to 220 kpc ) .",
    "this component was created in an encounter between the smc and the lmc 2.2 gyrs ago , and is the oldest and the most distant feature in the magellanic system .",
    "two tidal tails were drawn @xmath69 myr ago from the magellanic bridge and follow the main filament along most of its length .    by drawing a parallel with this simulation ,",
    "streams s2 , s3 and s4 could represent a 3-way splitting of the main ms filament . as we show in the next section , this gas has had enough time to cool and fragment and is therefore very clumpy .",
    "as suggested by the simulation , most of the spatial 3-way splitting could have occurred in the more recent past , 1 gyr to 500 myr ago , during close encounters between the ms and the lmc .",
    "the fact that s2 to s4 show a decreasing steepness in their velocity gradients may be suggesting that these filaments were separated in subsequent encounters .",
    "s1 on the other hand , may represent one of the more recently formed tidal tails , drawn out of the magellanic bridge @xmath69 myrs ago .",
    "the fact that it is significantly less clumpy than the other three streams suggests that s1 may be significantly younger , and have not had enough time to cool and fragment .",
    "the lack of large hi clumps at the higher galactic latitude suggests that the far tip of the ms may be more distant .",
    "however , the fact that we find clumps with multi - phase structure almost along the whole latitude range implies that the far tip is probably not too distant .",
    "as discussed in the next section , it would be hard to justify the existence of multi - phase medium at a distance of @xmath70 kpc .",
    "another disagreement with the simulation concerns the observed lsr velocity at the far tip , we find @xmath71 , while the simulation predicts velocities down to @xmath67 .",
    "however , the observed large - scale filaments at the tip of the ms , as well as the evidence for kinematic bifurcation , give strong support to the tidal formation scenario for the ms .",
    "while the observations are only qualitatively in agreement with the simulations , and many details still have to be worked out , it is extremely encouraging to see that detailed spatial and velocity structure of the ms can be reproduced _",
    "purely _ by tidal interactions .",
    "better observed coverage of this region , as well as high resolution observations of the southern ms extension , will certainly help to constrain this and other possibilities in the future .",
    "at certain velocities the ms has a very clumpy morphology .",
    "one of the obvious questions is : what physical processes are responsible for such a clumpy structure ? in trying to understand the cloud origin we look briefly into three important physical processes that would affect a tidal stream of warm gas moving through a hot ambient medium .",
    "all three processes have their characteristic time and spatial scales .",
    "thermal instability arises due to gas cooling and results in spatial fragments of the wnm , whose size is defined by the cooling length @xmath72 .",
    "this process operates on the cooling timescale , defined by @xmath73 , with @xmath74 being the cooling function , @xmath75 being the boltzmann constant , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 being the temperature and volume density of the wnm gas .",
    "if we consider a wnm gas that originated in the smc , then @xmath78 @xmath42 ( based on the size and total mass of the smc , also measurements in @xcite ) , then for @xmath79 k we estimate @xmath80 pc and the cooling timescale of @xmath81 myr . for a lower value of @xmath77 , which is not unreasonable for the gas drawn out of the smc outskirts , both @xmath72 and @xmath82 will increase . considering that most models suggest the ms age of 1 - 1.5 gyr , thermal instability , with a typical timescale of a few tens to a few hundreds of myrs ,",
    "most likely have had a significant effect on the evolution of the ms gas .",
    "recent numerical simulations by @xcite provide an example of thermal condensation of warm gas .",
    "these simulations focus on a collision of incoming turbulent wnm flows and thermal condensation of wnm into colder gas .",
    "while not exactly applicable in our case , it is still very instructive to notice the properties of typical thermal fragments .",
    "a collision of incoming wnm streams creates a thermally unstable region , which partially condenses into cold clouds .",
    "the thermally unstable warm gas ( with temperature of 200  5000 k ) has a filamentary morphology and its fragmentation into cold clouds ( with temperature @xmath69 k ) is heavily controlled by turbulence .",
    "cold clouds formed in simulations are thermally stable and long - lived , in the case of stronger turbulence they have round morphology , while a weaker turbulence is responsible for more elongated morphology of cold clouds .",
    "the simulations show that the fraction of cold gas ( with temperature @xmath69 k ) produced in this process ranges from 10% in a strong turbulent case , to about 30% in a weak turbulent case .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lower bound on this cnm - to - wnm fraction agrees with the fraction of hi clouds with cool cores we find in our observations ( 12% ) .",
    "kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability occurs at the interface of the moving warm stream of gas and the ambient medium and also results in the formation of small fragments with a power - law size distribution .",
    "the timescale on which this instability develops , @xmath83 ( given in gyr ) , is given by : @xmath84 @xcite , where @xmath85 would be the initial size ( radius ) of the ms gas pulled out of the magellanic clouds , @xmath86 corresponds to the density contrast of the warm kh fragments and the ambient hot medium , and @xmath87 is the stream velocity .",
    "we use @xmath88  @xcite , assuming that the velocity of the original ms gas is equal to its present day velocity .",
    "we also assume that @xmath89 , based on the size of the msvi portion of the ms , and that this material was initially at a distance of 60 kpc .",
    "if @xmath90 @xmath42 , and @xmath91 @xmath42 , then @xmath92 myr . as",
    "this timescale is almost comparable to the age of the ms ( in the framework of tidal and ram - pressure models ) , we can conclude that the kh instability has had a negligible effect on the evolution of the ms gas .",
    "once the warm stream has fragmented due to thermal / kh instability into smaller clouds , the third process becomes important  this is conductive heat transfer between the warm stream fragments and the hot ambient medium .",
    "@xcite show that the size of the smallest fragments is set by the cloud ability to radiate away the energy flux due to conduction .",
    "the warm clouds reside within warmer phases , hot halo gas with @xmath93 k and warm ionized gas with @xmath94 k. detections of ovi absorption from gas associated with the ms @xcite give strong support for the existence of an ionized component around the ms with @xmath95 k. it is expected that different phases are separated by an interface region through which heat flows between the two phases .",
    "the interface is a surface of transition where , for small clouds , the wnm evaporates into the warmer medium . the classical evaporation theory",
    "@xcite predicts a critical radius for clouds at which radiative losses balance the conductive heat input , and at which the cloud neither evaporates nor condenses . clouds smaller than the critical radius evaporate , while clouds larger than the critical radius accrete by condensation of the surrounding gas .    in the case of an interface between the wnm and the him , the cloud critical radius ( @xmath96 ) times",
    "the density of the surrounding medium , @xmath97 , is @xmath98 @xmath15 for @xmath99 k , or @xmath100 @xmath15 for @xmath101 k ( from fig . 2 in mckee & cowie 1977 ) .",
    "generally , the expected critical radius decreases with increasing @xmath97 .",
    "however , for @xmath102 @xmath42 , the critical radius is large , @xmath103 pc .",
    "clouds smaller than @xmath70 pc would then evaporate , while wnm clouds larger than @xmath70 pc would accrete the him by condensation .",
    "thermal fragments we considered in section 5.3 with a size @xmath104 pc will be predominantly smaller than the critical radius and therefore undergoing evaporation .",
    "these small ( @xmath70 pc ) , evaporating clouds are surprisingly long - lived though . for mainly neutral clouds surrounded by the hot gas , the classical mass - loss rate is @xmath105 gr yr@xmath30 for @xmath99 k , or @xmath106 gr yr@xmath30 for @xmath101 k @xcite . in the case of saturated evaporation",
    "the mass - loss rates are even lower . for @xmath78",
    "@xmath42 the evaporation timescale is @xmath107 gyr for @xmath99 k , or @xmath108 gyr for @xmath101 k. but the timescales are in general long , approaching or being longer than 1 gyr .",
    "we hence conclude that small fragments would be able to survive for a long time , at least a gyr , most likely throughout the whole lifetime of the ms .",
    "as thermal instability must have played a very important role in the evolution of the oldest ms gas , we suggest that this could be the dominant process responsible for the clumpy structure found in our observations . the importance of thermal instability is further supported by the large abundance of small hi clumps ( see section 4.2.1 ) . the kh instability is important as well , however it has a significantly longer timescale .",
    "as we have shown , it is reasonable to expect that thermal and/or kh fragments can survive for a long time , especially if surrounded by the ambient gas with @xmath95 k.    it is interesting that cloud morphology in our observations is dominated by round shapes .",
    "elongated or head - tail clouds are surprisingly absent in our hi images .",
    "head - tail morphology is commonly observed for chvcs and is often seen as a signature of ram - pressure stripping , or other types of interactions between a cloud and the ambient halo medium .",
    "we therefore conclude that ram pressure effects probably have a secondary role , with gravitational forces being the dominant gas removal process .",
    "if we assume that thermal fragmentation is the dominant process responsible for the clumpy structure , we can estimate a distance to the ms .",
    "if we assume that the median value of the cloud angular size distribution ( 10@xmath0 ) corresponds to the linear size of ` typical ' thermal fragments , @xmath109 pc ( derived assuming @xmath78 @xmath42 ) , we estimate a distance of @xmath2 kpc",
    ". please note that these numbers are only representative .",
    "the cloud angular size varies and is also affected by our resolution limit , the volume density of the warm ms gas is also not a constant number .",
    "however , this exercise is very instructive and demonstrates that thermal fragments can reasonably well explain at least some small - scale structure in the ms .",
    "the ms distance of @xmath2 kpc is in agreement with the predictions from tidal models .",
    "even more impressively , this distance agrees well with the recent estimate of 75 kpc by @xcite , who used a geometrodynamical model and assumed that the ms follows a planar orbit around the galactic center .",
    "also , the existence of multi - phase hi clouds can be used to place an upper limit on the ms distance .",
    "it is important to stress that the existence of multi - phase clouds along the tip of the ms , and especially at a distance of @xmath110 kpc , is extremely surprising from a theoretical point of view .",
    "based on the consideration of cooling and heating processes in an isothermal 10@xmath111 k halo , @xcite predicted that multi - phase clouds , pressure confined by the hot halo , should exist in the ms only at distances less than 20 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "more recently , considering chvcs @xcite showed that dark matter can provide an additional confinement mechanism , allowing the existence of multi - phase structure at distances @xmath112 kpc .",
    "the multi - phase clouds at the tip of the ms therefore suggest that the tip is likely to be at a distance @xmath113 kpc .",
    "this argues against the existence of the third , very distant stream found in the simulations by @xcite , at least within the area covered by our observations .",
    "also , as pointed out by @xcite , the multi - phase structure at the ms distance suggests a lower confining halo gas pressure than what is expected in the theoretical framework .",
    "we have obtained hi observations of a region , @xmath114 square degrees large , at the tip of the ms .",
    "the major results are as follows .    1 .",
    "we find four coherent hi streams at the tip of the ms , extending continuously from dec 5  to @xmath115 .",
    "the streams have different morphology and velocity gradients .",
    "three streams are very clumpy , while one stream is mainly made up of large diffuse structures .",
    "the comparison of observations with the tidal simulations by @xcite suggests that the three clumpy streams could be a result of a 3-way tidal splitting of the main ms filament , induced by encounters between the lmc and the ms .",
    "the fourth stream is probably much younger , and could have been tidally drawn from the magellanic bridge in the more recent past , @xmath116 myr .",
    "this stream is more diffuse because it has not had enough time to cool and fragment .",
    "we find an extensive population of hi clouds at the tip of the ms .",
    "the smallest clouds have a size reaching down to our resolution limit of 3.5@xmath0 .",
    "70% of clouds have an angular size in the range 3.5@xmath010@xmath0 .",
    "about 12% of the ms clouds show multi - phase velocity profiles , indicating the co - existence of cooler and warmer gas .",
    "cloud central velocities show two peaks at @xmath29 and @xmath32 .",
    "we show that for warm gas trailing through the galactic halo for the past gyr or so , the effects of kh instability are relatively unimportant .",
    "however , thermal instability , with a typical timescale of a few myrs to a few hundred myrs , is significantly important and will result in the fragmentation of gas and the formation of smaller clumps .",
    "the observed clumpiness at the tip of the ms could be fully or partially due to this mechanism .",
    "we show that thermal / kh fragments can survive in the hot halo for a long time ( @xmath117 gyr ) , especially if surrounded by a @xmath1 k halo gas .",
    "if the observed angular size of hi clumps is due to thermal instability , then the tip of the ms is at a distance of @xmath2 kpc .",
