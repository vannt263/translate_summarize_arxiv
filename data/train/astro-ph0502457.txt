    "1960 s and 1970 s : the rocket experiments and the early satellites like uhuru and ariel-5 were not sensitive enough to detect the weak and soft thermal emission of neutron stars .",
    "a speculation by chiu ( 1964 ) that the x - rays from the crab nebula were due to a hot neutron star with kt@xmath54kev was soon disproved by the famous nrl lunar occultation experiment which found only an extended source ( bowyer et al . 1964 ) .",
    "1980 s : the einstein observatory gave the first sensitive upper limit for the temperature of the crab pulsar , kt@xmath60.2kev ( 3@xmath7 ( harnden & seward , 1984 ) .",
    "it is remarkable the most recent upper limit obtained with chandra is not much lower , namely @xmath60.17kev ( 3@xmath7 ( weisskopf 2004 ) .",
    "the obstacles are the huge magnetospheric emission and the large interstellar absorption , apart from problems with the chandra - hrc timing .",
    "as far as other pulsars are concerned einstein and exosat yielded only upper limits for their thermal emission as well .",
    "1990 s : a breakthrough came with rosat due to the excellent soft response of its pspc . thermal emission from a number of pulsars could be clearly identified while asca measured the `` hard power law tails '' which are of magnetospheric origin . among these sources",
    "are psr 105552 , psr 0656 + 14 and the newly discovered geminga which have been called the `` three musceteers '' .",
    "perhaps even more important was the rosat discovery of a new class of thermally emitting neutron stars , which show no radio emission and no hard spectral tails , viz .",
    "no indication for magnetospheric emission .",
    "these objects called `` isolated neutron stars '' are the main subject of this paper ( sometimes they have been called x - ray dim isolated neutron stars  xdins  , but this is misleading because they are quite bright in x - rays , but dim in optical light ) .    2000 s : recently radio pulsars and isolated neutron stars have been studied extensively with the new powerful x - ray observatories chandra and xmm - newton which , taken together , provide a very substantial increase in collecting power , angular resolution , spectral bandwidth and spectral resolution compared with rosat and other previous missions .",
    "one of the fundamental problems of neutron star physics is to determine the equation of state at supra - nuclear densities . in order to get a handle on",
    "that one must constrain the mass - radius relation and this can be done in principle by various methods which all have their specific problems :    * measurement of the gravitational redshift of spectral features . problems : identification of the feature , large spectral shifts in superstrong magnetic fields . *",
    "measurement of the surface gravity by analysing the radiative transfer in the neutron star photosphere .",
    "problem : the method is not very sensitive and accurate . *",
    "measurement of characteristic frequencies ( qpo ) in accreting sources ( see contributions of m.van der klis , and f. lamb in this volume ) . * measurement of the photospheric radius .",
    "main problem : requires knowledge of the source distance .",
    "we will discuss this method in more detail in this paper which will be organized as follows : in section 1 we will give a short summary of the x - ray emitting radio pulsars concentrating on those sources which have measured parallaxes . in section 2 we will review the properties of radio quiet isolated neutron stars , and section 3 will be devoted to the brightest of these sources , the enigmatic object rxj18563754 for which measurements of the parallax exist .",
    "three different x - ray spectral components have been identified in radio pulsars :    * the magnetospheric radiation , which is characterised by beaming and a power law spectrum .",
    "this component dominates the emission of very energetic pulsars and decreases rapidly with age . * thermal emission from the polar caps , which are heated by the bombardment by high energy radiation / particles from the magnetosphere , or by heat outflow from the core region .",
    "this component has been detected in middle age pulsars like psr0656 + 14 and millisecond pulsars ( rxj043747 ) .",
    "since millisecond pulsars should have a cool core , their polar caps must be heated by magnetospheric bombardment . * thermal radiation from the bulk surface , which is heated by core cooling .",
    "the alternative possibility of heating by low level accretion has not been positively identified yet .",
    "what has just been said is reflected in the distribution of the @xmath550 x - ray detected radio pulsars in the p - dp / dt diagram shown in fig .  1 .",
    "evidently , we see just those pulsars in x - rays , which have the largest spin down power ( @xmath5dp / dtp@xmath8 , or youngest age ( @xmath5dp / dtp@xmath9 .",
    "the multicomponent spectra of three middle age pulsars depicted in fig .  2 clearly show the huge thermal peaks above the background of the broad - band nonthermal ( magnetospheric ) emissions .",
    "we note that a similar spectrum has been found in psr105552 , the third of the three musketeers . on the other hand ,",
    "the rather young pulsar psrj18111926 ( 64ms , 24000yrs ) shows only a thermal component but no hard tail , which would indicate magnetospheric emission ( mc gowan 2003 ) .",
    "obviously , the visibility of the beamed magnetospheric emission depends crucially on the orientation of spin axis and magnetic axis with respect to the line of sight .    of special interest",
    "is the small subsample of pulsars for which distances are known from optical or radio parallaxes :        [ fig1 ]    for psr 0656 + 14 the distance has been determined using the vlba ( brisken et al .",
    "2003 ) , resulting in d=288@xmath10pc which is significantly lower than the long used dispersion distance of 850pc . using magnetized hydrogen atmospheric model fits brisken et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find a radius r@xmath213 - 20 km , while the analysis of pavlov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) yields r@xmath530 km ( scaled to the distance of 288pc ) . here and in the following r represents the radius measured by a distant observer .    for geminga the parallax has been determined from hst observations which give d=157@xmath11pc and a blackbody radius r@xmath12@xmath59 km ( caraveo et al .",
    "according to zavlin & pavlov ( 2002 ) the hydrogen / helium photospheric model fits in general yield radii which are larger by a factor 2 - 7 compared with blackbody fits , while those for magnetized h / he atmospheres are between nonmagnetic and blackbody radii . in the absence of a more detailed analysis of the soft geminga spectrum",
    "we conclude that the radius is probably substantially larger than 10 km .",
    "[ fig2 ]    the vela pulsar has a vlb distance of 290pc ( dodson et al .",
    "2003 ) which for a magnetized hydrogen atmosphere model leads to a radius r=17 - 20 km ( pavlov et al . 2002 ) .    in summary , the observations point to radii measured at infinity of 14 - 20 km",
    "the excellent soft x - ray response of rosat pointed and all - sky observations ( see trmper 1983 ) have led to the discovery of seven radio quiet , thermally emitting neutron stars which have been dubbed `` the magnificent seven '' .",
    "a review of the observations can be found in a recent paper of haberl 2004 .",
    "the measured blackbody temperatures are between kt=44@xmath1396 ev , and the optical magnitudes are fainter than 24@xmath14 ( c.f .",
    "table 1 ) .",
    "all x - ray spectra show a low interstellar absorption , indicating that the objects are nearby , closer than a few hundred pc . for three of the sources",
    "proper motions could be measured which turn out to be very high , implying high space velocities and close distances .",
    "none of the sources shows an obvious association with a known supernova remnant , which suggests that they have ages @xmath1510@xmath16yrs .",
    "four of the seven sources show x - ray pulsations with periods of typically 10sec and pulsed fractions of typically 10% ( c.f .",
    "table  1 ) , suggesting that the neutron stars have an inhomogeneous temperature distribution .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .parameters of radio quiet isolated neutron stars ( updated version of haberl 2004 ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in summary , these findings strongly suggest that these `` magnificent seven '' are strongly magnetized ( 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath1 g ) , slowly rotating neutron stars having an inhomogeneous temperature distribution over the stellar surface . their main energy source must be heat loss from the hot interior ( cooling ) , since accretion of matter from the interstellar medium is too inefficient due to the high stellar velocities .",
    "these sources do not show radio emission , probably because either they are evolved beyond the pulsar death line or because their radio beam is too narrow due to their large light cylinder radius .",
    "among the radio quiet isolated neutron stars rxj1856.5 - 3754 ( henceforth rxj1856 ) is the brightest and the only one with a known distance .",
    "therefore it is best qualified for detailed studies aiming at a determination of its radius , and in the rest of this paper we concentrate primarily on this object .",
    "rxj1856 was discovered serendipitously in a rosat pspc field by walter et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . using the ( hst ) walter & matthews ( 1997 ) identified the x - ray source with a faint blue star ( v @xmath2 26 mag ) .",

    "tail extending along the direction of motion .",
    "none of the x - ray observations revealed any variability on time scales up to ten years .",
    "the so far best upper limit of 1.3% ( 2@xmath18 on periodic variations in the range 10@xmath1950hz has been established by burwitz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using a xmm - newton epic - pn observation .",
    "chandra letg observations with high spectral resolution show a spectrum that can be fit by a planckian spectrum with a temperature of 63@xmath173ev , ( c.f .",
    "fig .  3 ) . despite the excellent photon statistics and the good energy resolution of the letg",
    "this spectrum is devoid of any spectral features .",
    "compared with the optical spectrum which shows a rayleigh - jeans slope ( @xmath20 , the x - ray spectrum is reduced by a factor of @xmath56 . therefore , the overall spectrum of the source has often been described by a two - temperature blackbody model ( e.g. pons et al .",
    "2002 , burwitz et al .",
    "2003 , pavlov & zavlin 2003 , trmper et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "[ fig3 ]    a large number of papers have been dealing with the questions concerning the nature of this compact object and the proposed answers include everything from `` normal '' neutron stars with stiff or soft equations of state over neutron stars having a quarks core to bare ( strange ) quark stars , p - stars etc ( for references c.f .",
    "turolla et al .",
    "2003 ) . before coming back to this topic",
    "we want to summarize some more observational data and their immediate consequences in somewhat more detail .",
    "the impressive lack of any significant spectral features in the letg spectrum excludes magnetic fields of ( 1.3 - 7 ) @xmath21 10@xmath22 g ( electron cyclotron lines ) and ( 2 - 13 ) @xmath21 10@xmath0 g @xmath23(proton cyclotron lines ) , see burwitz et al .",
    "this leaves the possibility open of a low magnetic field characteristic for millisecond pulsars or a high magnetic field typical for normal pulsars .",
    "unfortunately , due to the absence of a periodicity the usual estimate of the magnetic field of rx j1856 based on the rotating dipole model is not possible . using phenomenological arguments based on the very small pulsed fraction in x - rays and on a comparison with other objects van kerkwijk & kulkarni ( 2001 ) ] have argued that the star has a relatively low magnetic field of a few 10@xmath22 g which may be marginally consistent with the absence of proton cyclotron lines .",
    "but this is not the only possibility .",
    "we estimate the magnetic field using the spin - down luminosity de / dt @xmath2 4 @xmath21 10@xmath24 erg / s required for powering the cometary - like emission nebula ( kerkwijk & kulkarni 2001 ) and the age of the star ( t @xmath2 5 @xmath21 10@xmath16 years ) inferred from its proper motion and the distance to its likely birthplace in the upper sco ob association ( walter & lattimer 2002 ) . applying the model of magnetic dipole braking",
    "we find a period of a @xmath21.8sec and a magnetic field strength of @xmath21.1 @xmath21 10@xmath0 g. we emphasise that these figures are very similar to those of the second brightest object of this kind , the pulsating source rxj0720 whose spectral characteristics are very similar to those of rxj1856 . while the estimate of de / dt may be considered as rather reliable , the age derived from the birthplace argument is not so certain .",
    "however , an age of t @xmath2 5 @xmath21 10@xmath16 years ( with an uncertainty of a factor of two ) is fully consistent with what we know empirically about the cooling of neutron stars .",
    "we therefore conclude that the magnetic field of rxj1856 is probably large , i.e. of the order of @xmath2510@xmath0 g . to confirm this , it is necessary to exclude the alternative hypothesis of a millisecond pulsar ( van kerkwijk & kulkarni 2001 , pavlov & zavlin 2003 ) . to this end",
    "a high time resolution observation with xmm - newton has already been scheduled .",
    "the main puzzle of rxj1856 is the observational fact that its x - ray spectrum ( fig .",
    "3 ) is completely featureless .",
    "it has been pointed out by burwitz et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2003 ) that nonmagnetic photospheric spectra assuming a pure iron composition are incompatible with the measured spectrum because the predicted fe - l features are not detected with high significance .",
    "even a solar composition model with its small abundance of metals leads to unacceptable spectral fits .",
    "doppler smearing of the spectral lines due to fast rotation does not wash away completely the strongest spectral features ( braje & romani 2002 , pavlov et al .",
    "2002 ) ] . on the other hand hydrogen or helium photospheres can be excluded , because they would over - predict the optical flux by a very large factor ( pavlov et al .",
    "therefore any nonmagnetic photosphere can be firmly excluded .",
    "this argument can be extended to magnetized hydrogen and helium photospheres ( zavlin & pavlov 2002 ) .",
    "iron photospheric models have been calculated by rajagopal et al .",
    "1997 for b=10@xmath26 and 10@xmath0g.@xmath23unfortunately they suffer from the fact that the radiative properties of iron atoms / ions in super strong magnetic fields are not known exactly , but only in hartree - fock approximation ( work of neuhauser et al .",
    "the resulting spectra contain a lot of lines having spacings of 50 - 100 ev , which could be easily resolved by the letg ( resolution @xmath61 ev ) .",
    "however , according to neuhauser et al .",
    "( 1987 ) the iron energy levels show a b@xmath27-dependence and therefore a magnetic smearing will take place if the flux is integrated over the whole stellar surface . for a dipolar field , with a factor of two variation of the magnetic field between pole and equator , the spectral features would be broadened by 80 - 300 ev .",
    "thus it is at least plausible , that the combination of a dense level structure of the magnetic atoms with a dispersion of the magnetic field produces a spectrum , which appears as a continuum seen with the letg .",
    "we believe that this is the most promising model for explaining the featureless x - ray spectrum of rxj1856 .",
    "alternatively , the absence of any spectral feature may indicate that the star has no atmosphere but a condensed matter surface ( burwitz et al 2001 , turolla et al .",
    "such a surface is expected to be reflective in the x - ray domain ( trmper & lenzen 1978 ) , brinkmann 1980 ) which could also help to explain the low x - ray / optical flux ratio ( see section 3.4 ) .",
    "condensation of surface matter requires low temperatures and strong magnetic fields . to condense hydrogen at a temperature of kt = 63 ev a magnetic field of 5 @xmath21 10@xmath0 g is required ( lai 2001 ) . for iron",
    "it is not clear i whether a condensate can exist at all . according to lai ( 2001 )",
    "the cohesive energy of iron is uncertain , but condensation may possibly occur at 3 @xmath21 10@xmath1 g ( for kt = 63 ev ) while neuhauser et al .",
    "( 1987 ) conclude that iron can not condensate at all .",
    "another problem is that in general the optical properties of a condensed matter surface as a function of photon energy , polarisation and magnetic field angle have only been calculated in the continuum ( plasma ) approximation while the effects of atomic and solid state physics have been neglected . in summary",
    "it is not clear whether a condensed matter surface can exist and - if it would - whether it could provide a solution for the absence of line features .",
    "already the rosat and optical data had shown that the optical rayleigh - jeans type spectrum of rxj1856 is about a factor of @xmath23 brighter than the extrapolation of the x - ray blackbody towards lower frequencies ( e.g. pons et al .",
    "2002 ) . using current optical data and the letg spectrum",
    "this factor turns out to be even larger , namely factor 5 - 7 ( haberl 2004 ) .",
    "this optical excess has been explained in terms of an inhomogeneous temperature distribution with a hot pole and a cool equator , which would lead to a periodic flux variation as observed for four of the seven sources .",
    "however , for rxj1856 the xmm - newton data put an upper limit of 1.3% on the pulsed fraction in the range 50 - 10@xmath19hz ( burwitz et al .",
    "there are several possibilities to explain this behaviour :    * the rotational frequency could be larger than 50hz , viz .",
    "the source would be a millisecond pulsar .",
    "we regard this case unlikely in view of the arguments on its magnetic fields discussed above .",
    "anyway it will be checked soon by xmm - newton epic pn observations in the high time resolution mode . *",
    "the extreme alternative is , that the neutron star has spun down within @xmath510@xmath28 years to very long periods , p@xmath2510000sec by the propeller effect .",
    "this requires an extremely strong magnetic field ( @xmath510@xmath29 g ) and a relatively low velocity ( mori & ruderman 2003 ) . *",
    "the simplest explanation is that the rotational axis of the neutron star is closely aligned with the line of sight or with the magnetic axis .",
    "this may look unlikely in view of the low pulsed fraction of @xmath61.3% , but the average pulsed fraction of the other four sources is only @xmath212% . therefore the possibility of an accidental alignment can not be neglected .",
    "in this context we note that the tight constraint on the alignment could be somewhat relaxed if the x - ray flux were reduced due to reflection effects because the size of the x - ray emitting spot would be increased .",
    "whatever the answers to the open questions discussed in sections 3.2.3.4 .",
    "are , one can derive a lower limit for the photospheric radius based on blackbody fits for the overall spectrum and on the source distance , as discussed by burwitz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and trmper et al .",
    "indeed , such a lower limit is expected to be a quite conservative one , keeping in mind that a blackbody is the most efficient radiator . with other words : any real emitter needs to have a larger surface than a blackbody radiator in order to emit the same luminosity .",
    "we stress that the application of this rather general `` thermodynamic '' argument seems justified in view of the shape of the broadband spectrum , which is characterised by a clear rayleigh - jeans law in the optical and a wien - like behaviour at x - ray energies . for our analysis",
    "we use the distance of 117 pc , which has been derived from four hst observations ( walter & lattimer 2002 ) .",
    "we first consider a simple two - component blackbody model for the optical and x - ray spectrum of rxj1856 ( burwitz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which is shown in fig .",
    "the blackbody radius and temperature of the x - ray emitting hot spot derived from the chandra letg spectrum are r@xmath30=4.4 km and kt@xmath31=63ev , respectively .",
    "the optical spectrum is interpreted as the sum of the rayleigh - jeans spectra of both the hot and the cool component .",
    "this fixes ( r@xmath32)@xmath33@xmath3t@xmath32+(r@xmath31)@xmath33@xmath3t@xmath31 .",
    "the condition that the optical spectrum of the cool component does not show up as a deviation in the x - ray spectrum limits the corresponding temperature to kt@xmath34 33 ev at the 3@xmath35 level ( burwitz et al.2003 ) ) . using these figures we find for the radius of the neutron star r=(r@xmath36+r@xmath37)@xmath38 * @xmath25 * 16.5 km ( 3@xmath7 .",
    "[ fig4 ]    as an alternative we use a model with a continuous temperature distribution ( c.f .",
    "4b ) of the form    @xmath39    the best fit to the overall spectrum yields a central temperature of the hot spot t@xmath40=82ev , an angular size of the hot spot @xmath41=40@xmath42 and @xmath43=2.1 .",
    "in this case the neutron star radius turns out to be 16.8 km ( @xmath253@xmath7 , not much different from that of the simpler model .",
    "these apparent radii r measured by a distant observer are related to the `` true '' stellar radius r@xmath44 by    @xmath45    where @xmath46=2gm / c@xmath33 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the corresponding bound in the m ",
    "@xmath47 diagram is shown in fig .",
    "4 . for a standard neutron star of 1.4 solar masses",
    "the true radii are r@xmath48=14.0 km ( fig .",
    "4a ) and r@xmath48=14.1 km ( fig .",
    "4b ) , respectively , and thus considerably larger than the canonical radius of 10 km .",
    "this implies a rather stiff equation of state .",
    "we note , that the same conclusion was reached by braje & romani ( 2002 ) using a two - component model and similar arguments . in order to compare our results with the predictions of theoretical neutron star models in more detail we use the mass - radius diagram given by pons et al .",
    "( 2002 ) this diagram is shown in fig .",
    "5 to which we have added a curve corresponding to the apparent radius of r=16.5 km .",
    "[ fig5 ]    it is evident that the result of our analysis excludes the quark star models discussed by pons et al ( 2002 ) and by schertler et al .",
    "also the neutron star models with quark matter cores discussed in the latter paper are rejected .",
    "we conclude that for a source distance of 117pc this neutron star must have a very stiff equation of state .",
    "recent improvements of the rxj18563754 parallax , which use additional hst observations at four different epochs ( kaplan 2004 ) yield an even larger distance of 160pc .",
    "this result considerably sharpens our conclusion .",
    "in this context one may speculate that a too large radius could imply that this neutron star has an anomalously low mass ( @xmath60.4m@xmath49 . but that would raise a lot of questions ; in particular it is doubtful whether such a low mass neutron star could be formed .    in summary ,",
    "the observation of rxj18563754 strongly suggest that the size of a neutron star is rather @xmath2514 km instead of the canonical size of 10 km .",
    "this result gets support from the observations of the three radio pulsars discussed in section 2 .",
    "this has consequences for pulsar astrophysics : e.g. the magnetic field strengths estimated from pulsar spin down observations have to be lowered by at least a factor of two since b @xmath5r@xmath50 , and the moment of inertia and therefore the estimate of the pulsar rotational energy of a pulsar increases by a similar factor .",
    "however , the most important result of our analysis is that the behaviour of nuclear matter at very high densities is governed by a very stiff equation of state .",
    "we have learned a lot about cooling neutron stars from x - ray and optical observations since 1990 , and we can hope to learn a lot more from astro - e , xeus and constellation - x in the future . however , an all - sky survey in the soft x - ray band which is at least ten times more sensitive than rosat would be most important , to find more and fainter sources of this type . at the same time",
    ", it would be necessary to improve the sensitivity of optical observations with instruments of the 30 - 100 m class in order to measure the faint optical spectra .",
    "finally , it seems essential to develop further our understanding of atomic and condensed matter physics under the conditions of very strong magnetic fields .",
