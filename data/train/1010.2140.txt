    "starting with the fundamental contributions of gromov and floer , holomorphic curve techniques had a great impact on our understanding of the dynamics of hamiltonian systems .",
    "the three body problem is a hamiltonian system with a particular intriguing dynamics . during the visit of the first two authors to the ias in princeton , helmut hofer raised the question of whether holomorphic curve techniques can be applied to the three body problem .",
    "the power of holomorphic curve techniques relies on a particular compactness result , called gromov compactness . in order to prove gromov compactness the hamiltonian system has to meet an additional convexity assumption .",
    "namely a liouville vector field transverse to energy hypersurfaces has to exist .",
    "we prove in this paper that this assumption holds true for the planar circular restricted three body problem for energy values below and slightly above the first critical value .",
    "the restricted three body problem assumes that two massive primaries , which we refer to as the earth and the moon , rotate around each other according to kepler s law on ellipses .",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of a third massless object called the satellite . since the satellite is massless it does not influence the propagation of the primaries , however the primaries attract the satellite according to newton s law of gravitation .",
    "if the ellipses are circles then the restricted three body problem in rotating coordinates admits an integral , which we abbreviate by @xmath0 .",
    "this special case of the restricted three body problem is called the circular restricted three body problem . if in addition the satellite stays on the plane spanned by the earth and the moon the problem is referred to as the planar circular restricted three body problem .",
    "energy hypersurfaces for the planar circular restricted three body problems are three dimensional .",
    "however , they are not compact .",
    "this is due to collisions of the satellite with one of the primaries .",
    "however , it is well known in celestial mechanics that two body collisions can be regularized .",
    "it was observed by moser that the regularized kepler problem coincides with the geodesic flow of the two sphere . in particular , energy hypersurfaces",
    "are diffeomorphic to @xmath1 . in moser",
    "s regularization the position and momenta variables are interchanged and the point at infinity on the sphere corresponds to collision orbits whose velocity explodes .    for low energy levels",
    "@xmath2 the energy hypersurface @xmath3 for the planar circular restricted three body problem has three connected components .",
    "indeed , the satellite either has to stay close to the earth , close to the moon , or be far away .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 and @xmath5 the connected component close to the earth respectively close to the moon . via moser",
    "s regularization these components can be compactified again to compact manifolds @xmath6 and @xmath7 which are both diffeomorphic to @xmath1 .    on the axis between earth and moon",
    "there is a critical point of the energy called the first lagrange point , which we denote by @xmath8 .",
    "if the energy level @xmath9 becomes higher than the action of the first lagrange point @xmath10 , then the satellite is in principle able to cross from the region around the earth to the region around the moon .",
    "the energy hypersurface now consists of only two connected components , one bounded which contains the regions around the earth and the moon and an unbounded one .",
    "we abbreviate by @xmath11 the bounded component .",
    "topologically this bounded component is just the connected sum of the two bounded components we had before . in particular ,",
    "its regularization @xmath12 is diffeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "to state our main theorem we need the following convention .",
    "let @xmath14 be a @xmath15-dimensional manifold .",
    "a hamiltonian structure on @xmath14 is a closed two - form whose kernel defines a one - dimensional distribution .",
    "a _ contact form _ on @xmath14 is a 1-form @xmath16 such that @xmath17 is a volume form .",
    "if @xmath18 is a hamiltonian structure on @xmath14 , then a contact form @xmath16 is called _ compatible _ with @xmath18 if @xmath19 .",
    "abraham and marsden use in @xcite different conventions .",
    "a hamiltonian structure is in their language a contact form , where a contact form in our sense corresponds to an exact contact form .",
    "moser s regularization is actually symplectic and therefore the regularized hypersurfaces are naturally endowed with a hamiltonian structure . the main result of this paper is : +   + * theorem a. * _ for @xmath20 both connected components @xmath6 and @xmath7 admit a compatible contact form @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , there exists @xmath21 such that if @xmath22 the same assertion holds true for @xmath12 .",
    "the drawback of theorem  a is that we only can prove the contact condition until slightly above the first critical value .",
    "there is no particular reason that the contact condition should fail for higher energy values and we actually expect that for every energy level the hypersurfaces are contact .",
    "however , this is an issue for further research .",
    "moser regularization actually endows the compact components of the energy hypersurfaces with a strong symplectic filling .",
    "in particular , the contact structures obtained in theorem  a are of restricted contact type and tight .    since there is only one tight contact structure on @xmath1 as well as on @xmath23 we obtain the following corollary of theorem  a.    for @xmath20 the contact structures @xmath24 and @xmath25 coincide with the tight @xmath1 and for @xmath22 the contact structure @xmath26 coincides with the tight @xmath27 .",
    "[ cor : tight ]    we note that in general it is a very difficult problem to decide if a given hamiltonian structure admits a compatible contact form .",
    "a notorious concrete case is that of hamiltonian structures arising from hamiltonians which contain `` magnetic terms '' , i.e. , terms which are linear in the momentum variables ( cf .",
    "this is precisely the case of the planar circular restricted three body problem which picks up a term of the form @xmath28 due to the rotating frame .",
    "before we mention two applications of theorem a we point out that the strong symplectic filling of the regularized energy hypersurface @xmath29 is @xmath30 , the unit co - disk bundle of @xmath31 , and of @xmath12 is the boundary connected sum @xmath32 , see remark [ rmk : bdry_connected_sum ] .",
    "the first application concerns existence of periodic orbits .",
    "it follows from the fact that the contact structures are tight , and rabinowitz s result on existence of closed orbits on starshaped hypersurfaces @xcite .",
    "the details of this derivation are explained by hofer in @xcite together with the fact that the lift of the tight contact structure on @xmath1 to @xmath33 is the unique tight contact structure on @xmath33 .    for any value @xmath34 ,",
    "the regularized planar circular restricted three body problem has a closed orbit with energy @xmath9 .",
    "the assertion of the previous corollary is trivially true for larger values of @xmath9 since the standard weinstein model for the connected sum contains a periodic orbit .",
    "the second application concerns leaf - wise intersection points .",
    "this notion is due to moser @xcite .",
    "we recall that if @xmath35 is a regular hypersurface then @xmath14 is foliated by the leaves of the characteristic line bundle @xmath36 .",
    "we denote by @xmath37 the leaf through @xmath38 and furthermore by @xmath39 the set of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms generated by a hamiltonian function with compact support .",
    "then , by definition , @xmath38 is a leaf - wise intersection point with respect to @xmath40 if @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the same as in theorem a. then for @xmath43 and any @xmath44 the regularized energy hypersurface @xmath12 carries a leaf - wise intersection point with respect to @xmath45 .    since the contact structures are of restricted contact type we can apply the theorem by cieliebak - frauenfelder - oancea @xcite and obtain that the rabinowitz floer homology of the energy hypersurface as defined by cieliebak - frauenfelder @xcite is isomorphic to the direct sum of symplectic homology and cohomology ( except possibly in finitely many degrees . ) by cieliebak s @xcite computation of the symplectic homology of a boundary - connected sum , see also mclean ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.20 ) for an improvement concerning the ring structure , we know @xmath46 combining this with the work of viterbo @xcite , salamon - weber @xcite , abbondandolo - schwarz @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the free loop space of @xmath31 we see that in both cases , @xmath20 and @xmath49 , rabinowitz floer homology of the energy hypersurface is infinite dimensional , in particular , non - zero .",
    "thus , work by albers - frauenfelder ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem c ) implies the corollary .",
    "we remark that theorem a and all its corollaries are valid for any mass ratio between the two primaries .",
    "in the proof of theorem  a it is convenient , although not necessary , to use some contact topology . in doing so",
    ", we can regard the dynamical problem from another perspective .",
    "let us begin by defining some key notions .",
    "a contact @xmath50-manifold @xmath51 is called * overtwisted * if @xmath51 admits an overtwisted disk , i.e. , an embedded disk @xmath52 such that @xmath53 for all @xmath54 .",
    "contact @xmath50-manifolds that are not overtwisted are called * tight*.    the contact topological behavior of tight and overtwisted contact manifolds differs very much .",
    "roughly speaking , one could say that tight @xmath50-manifolds are much more rigid than overtwisted ones . finding tight contact structures is a hard problem in general , but there is a simple criterion due to eliashberg and gromov , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ thm : fillable_tight ] suppose @xmath51 is a symplectically fillable @xmath50-manifold , then @xmath51 is tight .    by symplectic fillability",
    "we mean the following .",
    "a symplectic manifold @xmath55 is called a * strong symplectic filling * for @xmath51 if @xmath56 and there is a liouville vector field @xmath57 pointing outward along @xmath58 such that @xmath59 .",
    "some uniqueness results are known about tight @xmath50-manifolds .",
    "note that the general situation can be much more complicated , but the following suffices for our needs .",
    "[ thm : unique_tight_structure_rp3 ] the closed @xmath50-manifold @xmath60 admits a unique tight contact structure up to isotopy .    this unique tight contact structure is , in fact , symplectically fillable ; its filling is @xmath61 .",
    "alternatively , we can see @xmath62 as the contact manifold obtained from @xmath63 by dividing out by the antipodal map .",
    "finally , let us point out that tight manifolds admit a unique prime decomposition , see @xcite .",
    "[ thm : unique_prime_decomposition ] every non - trivial tight contact @xmath50-manifold @xmath51 is contactomorphic to a connected sum @xmath64 of finitely many prime tight contact @xmath50-manifolds",
    ". the summands are unique up to order and contactomorphism .    by prime we mean that a manifold is not decomposable in a non - trivial connected sum ; non - triviality is needed to exclude connected sums with @xmath63 .",
    "let us briefly recall the weinstein model for connected sums . consider @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "observe that the liouville vector field @xmath68 is transverse to level sets of @xmath69 provided @xmath70 .",
    "this observation is the starting point to show that connected sums of contact manifolds carry a contact structure .",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath72 be contact manifolds , and choose darboux balls @xmath73 . to perform the contact connected sum , observe that we can also embed @xmath74 in the two connected components of @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , one could regard @xmath75 as two disjoint darboux balls embedded as contact hypersurfaces in @xmath76 .",
    "now connect these two darboux balls by  interpolating \" @xmath75 to @xmath77 .",
    "this is the neck of the connected sum .",
    "note that this interpolation process is possible , since @xmath75 and @xmath77 are close to each other for large @xmath78 .",
    "the liouville vector field @xmath57 is transverse to this neck , and hence the connected sum is contact .",
    "alternatively , one could use the liouville flow to  map \" @xmath75 to @xmath77 . in this process",
    ", some isotopy is still necessary , though .",
    "suppose we want to perform symplectic handle attachment .",
    "to do so , consider the symplectic @xmath79-handle , @xmath80 and let @xmath81 be a ( not necessarily connected ) symplectic cobordism @xmath81 with boundary @xmath56 .",
    "take @xmath82 and @xmath83 points in @xmath58 along which we shall attach the handle .    by darboux s theorem",
    "we find neighborhoods @xmath84 of @xmath85 that are ( strictly ) contactomorphic to @xmath86 .",
    "that means that we can also find a strict contactomorphism @xmath87 from @xmath88 to a compact subset of the two components of the level set @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath81 is a symplectic cobordism , so a collar neighborhood of the boundary is symplectomorphic to @xmath89\\times m , d ( e^t\\alpha ) ) $ ] .",
    "we can construct a symplectomorphism from a collar neighborhood of @xmath84 to a compact subset of @xmath90 by gluing flow lines of the liouville vector field on @xmath81 ( @xmath91 in a collar neighborhood of the boundary ) to flow lines of the liouville vector field on @xmath90 .",
    "in other words , the symplectomorphism is of the form @xmath92\\times d_i \\subset [ -1,0]\\times m & \\longrightarrow & sh\\\\ ( t , x ) & \\longmapsto & fl^x_{t}({\\varphi}_i(x ) ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     the above formula is not quite accurate , since the amount a flow lines changes the value of @xmath93 in @xmath90 depends on the the precise starting point . in other words",
    ", @xmath94 maps the collar neighborhood @xmath95\\times d_i$ ] into a compact subset of @xmath90 , see figure  [ fig : weinstein_surgery ] for a sketch .",
    "define @xmath96 to be the compact subset of @xmath90 consisting of point @xmath97 that lie on a flow line of @xmath57 through @xmath98 .",
    "define the symplectic manifold obtained by handle attachment by @xmath99 where we identify @xmath100 \\times d_i \\subset w$ ] with @xmath101 in @xmath96 if and only if @xmath102 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : weinstein_surgery ] for an illustration of the symplectic handle attachment .",
    "in this section we recall the regularization introduced by j. moser in @xcite .",
    "this regularization will be used in subsequent sections , but here as a warm - up problem we apply it to the following integrable hamiltonian on @xmath103 : @xmath104 this hamiltonian corresponds precisely to the case when we set @xmath105 in ( [ mh ] ) and it describes the kepler problem in a rotating frame .    the first step is to change the independent variable @xmath106 to @xmath107 by setting @xmath108 and consider a new hamiltonian @xmath109 defined by @xmath110 here @xmath111 is the energy level of @xmath0 that we are interested in regularizing .",
    "the observation now is that for points at @xmath112 ( which corresponds to @xmath113 ) one has @xmath114 then the orbits of @xmath0 with energy @xmath111 and time parameter @xmath106 correspond to orbits in @xmath112 with time parameter @xmath107 .",
    "we now compute @xmath109 and we obtain : @xmath115 the second step consists in performing the canonical transformation @xmath116 and @xmath117 , so that now we would like to understand the zero energy level of : @xmath118    the last step is to introduce stereographic projection . using the same notation as in @xcite , we let @xmath119 be a point in @xmath120 with norm one , so it represents a point in @xmath31 .",

    "we will show that the hypersurfaces @xmath131 are all of contact type for the relevant range of energies ( @xmath132 ) , but first a remark .",

    "returning to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hkr ] ) , we rewrite it as : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the effective potential .",
    "if we let @xmath144 then @xmath145 the boundary of the hill s region ( see for the definition ) with energy @xmath111 is given by @xmath146 so we look at the cubic @xmath147 it follows that there is a compact hill s region iff @xmath148 .",
    "so for @xmath132 the compact hill s region is given by @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the smallest positive root of the cubic ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "thus @xmath132 is the range of energies for which @xmath131 has a compact connected component containing the zero section .",
    "we now show :    @xmath131 is starshaped for @xmath132 .",
    "we shall check that the liouville vector field @xmath152 is transverse to @xmath131 .",
    "since everything is rotationally symmetric about the @xmath153-axis , it is enough to consider the case of @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "so we look at @xmath131 over these points only : @xmath156=1 \\label{eq : sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath157 .",
    "now for @xmath16 near @xmath79 we let @xmath158 we wish to check that @xmath159 for points satisfying ( [ eq : sigma ] ) . after a calculation",
    "we find @xmath160 thus @xmath161 iff @xmath162 note that at the point with @xmath163 there is nothing to check and without loss of generality we may assume @xmath164 . using ( [ eq : sigma ] ) we see that still assuming @xmath161 @xmath165 clearly @xmath166 , thus @xmath167 now , if we let @xmath168 and @xmath169 we can rewrite the above as @xmath170    * claim . * if @xmath171 , then @xmath172 .",

    "is given at @xmath196 by @xmath197 i.e.  the sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the satellite . here",
    "the superscript @xmath198 indicates that we consider an inertial coordinate system . instead of considering an inertial coordinate system we can alternatively also study the propagation of the satellite in moving or synodical",
    "coordinates where the earth and moon are at rest .",
    "we choose the coordinates in such way that the position of the earth and moon satisfy @xmath199 the hamiltonian in the synodical coordinate system for the satellite is given by @xmath200 satisfying @xmath201 the transition from the inertial coordinate system to the moving coordinate system requires a time - dependent transformation and we refer to @xcite for a derivation of it .",
    "it is an amazing fact that in the rotating coordinate system the hamiltonian becomes autonomous , i.e.  independent of time .",
    "in particular , the hamiltonian @xmath0 is preserved under the flow .",
    "this observation goes back to jacobi and the integral @xmath202 is traditionally called the jacobi integral .",
    "we further note that the hamiltonian in the synodical coordinate system is not anymore of the simple form kinetic plus potential energy but contains the third term @xmath28 which is the moment map of the @xmath203-action on the cotangent bundle of @xmath204 induced from rotations of the base .",
    "one might think of this term as  rotational energy \" governing the centrifugal and coriolis forces of the rotating system . in the case where the hamiltonian is just the sum of kinetic and potential energy it is well - known that energy hypersurfaces are of contact type .",
    "however , because of the rotational term the question of whether energy hypersufaces of the hamiltonian @xmath0 are contact is far from obvious .",
    "indeed , formally the rotational forces are nothing but the lorentz force of a magnetic field ( after switching to the effective potential , see below ) and we refer to @xcite for examples of energy hypersurfaces which are not contact in the presence of a magnetic field .    if we complete the squares in the formula for the hamiltonian @xmath0 we end up with the expression @xmath205 the function @xmath206 given by @xmath207 is called the _ effective potential_. so we obtain the following condensed formula for the hamiltonian @xmath208 this expression of the hamiltonian shows clearly the presence of an exact magnetic field with primitive given by the 1-form @xmath209 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath143 has five critical points @xmath210 called _",
    "lagrangian points_. the first three critical points , which were already discovered by euler , are called collinear lagrangian points since they lie on the axis spanned by earth and moon .",
    "the first critical point @xmath211 lies in between earth and moon , @xmath212 on the opposite side of the moon and @xmath213 on the opposite side of the earth .",

    "we remark that the triangular lagrangian points are also sometimes referred to as trojan points since in the sun - jupiter system they correspond to the locations of the trojan asteroids .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between critical points of the effective potential and critical points of the hamiltonian .",
