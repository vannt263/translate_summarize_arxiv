    "<S> moreover there is a systematic way developed in @xcite to compute in principle all the @xmath116-corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several remarks for the effective action eq.([ea ] ) :    * low - energy effective action as curvature expansion : * the terms @xmath117 are understood as the high - energy correction to the leading order @xmath118 , since the @xmath88 implements the low - energy approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore as a power - series of @xmath108 , @xmath115 is understood as a low - energy effective action from covariant lqg . </S>",
    "<S> the deficit angle @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the mean ( area-)spacing of the lattice given by the background data @xmath50 , @xmath121 is the mean curvature of the background . </S>",
    "<S> thus the effective action @xmath115 can be viewed as a curvature expansion , where the high - energy corrections are given by @xmath122 with @xmath120 being the ( effective ) coupling constant of the high - derivative interactions .    * </S>",
    "<S> 2-parameter expansion : * there are two parameters involved in the expression of effective action @xmath115 , i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath123 ( or @xmath120 with dimension @xmath124 ) </S>",
    "<S> . @xmath76 counts the quantum corrections , while @xmath108 ( or @xmath120 ) counts the high - energy corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the two expansion parameters implements the semiclassical low - energy regime @xmath125 .    </S>",
    "<S> * restriction of @xmath108 : * the effective action @xmath126 has a negative real part , which is contained in the terms of higher - curvature @xcite , i.e. @xmath127={\\lambda}\\re[\\frac{1}{4}w^{-1}{\\gamma}^2\\mathring{\\theta}^2+o({\\gamma}^3\\mathring{\\theta}^3)+\\cdots]\\leq0 $ ] where @xmath57 stands for the terms suppressed by @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this negative real part on the exponential would have given an exponentially decaying factor in @xmath0 if @xmath128 was of @xmath129 , which is _ not _ our case because of @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - decaying @xmath0 requires that @xmath127 $ ] does nt scale to be large by @xmath34 , which results in a nontrivial bound of the deficit angle @xmath108 , i.e. ||^-1^-,[bound ] the situation is illustrated in fig.[phases1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the red region in fig.[phases1 ] illustrates the space ( in the coordinates @xmath95 and @xmath108 ) of background configurations @xmath130 , which validates the 2-parameter expansion of the effective action @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath108 is beyond the bound eq.([bound ] ) , where the approximation eq.([powercounting ] ) is invalid , the integral eq.[1 ] is exponentially decaying as @xmath34 by the same argument for @xmath86 integrals . </S>",
    "<S> thus the red region in fig.[phases1 ] illustrates the semiclassical low - energy effective degrees of freedom from the above approximation .        * </S>",
    "<S> einstein - hilbert action : * after the restriction eq.([bound ] ) , the leading contribution in @xmath115 , @xmath118 , is the regge action of gr as a functional of the edge - lengths determined by @xmath50 ( by identifying @xmath131 to be the area of the triangle @xmath5 in planck unit ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover given that that @xmath132 @xcite and that @xmath115 is a power - series in @xmath19 , the leading order contribution is essentially the einstein - hilbert action on a smooth manifold @xmath133 , i.e. as a functional ( see e.g. @xcite ) i_f_f_f=_md^4xr[_][1+o(_f / l^2 ) ] where @xmath134 is the lorentzian metric approximated by the simplicial geometry from @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath115 can be written as i_=_md^4xr[_][1+o(r)+o(1/)][20 ] where the leading contribution is einstein - hilbert action . </S>",
    "<S> the diffeomorphism invariance on @xmath133 is then recovered as an approximated symmetry in the leading order of semiclassical and low energy approximation .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath137 is required for @xmath22 . as @xmath138 and eq.([bound ] ) , @xmath0 is not decaying even without the restriction of @xmath108 . even a finite @xmath108 is admitted in eq.([ea ] ) without requiring @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed each @xmath108 is accompanied by a @xmath139 in @xmath115 ( and in eq.([1 ] ) originally ) , where @xmath139 appears as an effective scaling of the deficit angle . </S>",
    "<S> one may choose @xmath140 in eq.([2 ] ) as @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the regime @xmath136 , @xmath115 can be formulated as eq.([ea ] ) with finite deficit angle , where the leading order is regge action in general . </S>",
    "<S> sending @xmath141 neglects effectively the higher - curvature corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis here may explain the spinfoam graviton propagator calculations @xcite and the analysis in @xcite , which firstly motivate @xmath135 .    </S>",

    "<S> it relates to the `` flatness problem '' in spinfoam formulation discussed in @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the above discussion considers the fluctuations of spinfoam variables which touches a single critical configuration @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations touching many critical configurations @xmath143 results in a sum of the above perturbative expression of @xmath0 over all the critical configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we name the red region in fig.[phases1 ] the _ einstein sector _ @xmath144 as a subspace of spinfoam configurations , in which all the critical configurations are interpreted as globally oriented and time - oriented lorentzian geometry ( with @xmath145 globally ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the fluctuations of the spinfoam variables are considered within @xmath144 , the perturbative expression of the spinfoam amplitude is then given by a(k)=_(j_f , g_ve , z_vf)_c_ee^_md^4xr[g_][1+o(r)+o(1/ ) ] [ sum ] where @xmath146 is the lorentzian metric approximated by @xmath143 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([sum ] ) makes sense because the perturbations at a geometrical critical configuration ( of the type globally lorentzian , oriented , and time - oriented ) only touch the geometrical critical configuration of the same type . from eq.([sum ] ) we see that the contributions to @xmath0 from the perturbations within @xmath144 are given by the functional integration of einstein - hilbert action ( with a discrete measure ) plus the high - energy and quantum corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the leading contributions to @xmath0 in @xmath144 come from the critical configurations @xmath143 which give @xmath146 satisfying einstein equation ( with high - energy and quantum corrections ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the above discussion can be generalized straight - forwardly to the analysis of correlation functions . in the einstein sector @xmath144 </S>",
    "<S> , the perturbative result of the spinfoam correlation function coincides with the corresponding perturbative correlation function from einstein gravity or regge gravity , up to curvature and quantum corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> the corrections of higher order in curvature ( in deficit angle ) modifies the einstein ( regge ) gravity in high - energy regime . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to further investigate these high - curvature terms predicted from covariant lqg , in order to see if lqg can provide a uv - completion of perturbative einstein gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of high - curvature terms is the sum over _ non - regge - like _ spins ( the spins that can not be viewed as regge areas ) in spinfoam amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the non - regge - like spins are the extra uv degrees of freedom in addition to gr predicted by lqg . </S>",
    "<S> their dynamics may be studied via the action eq.([7 ] ) to see if they regulate einstein gravity at uv .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we remark that the analysis beyond the einstein sector @xmath144 can also be carried out . </S>",
