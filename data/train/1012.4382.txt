    "light - harvesting complexes ( lhc ) are pigment protein - complexes that act as the functional units of photosynthetic systems , capable of absorbing the energy of a photon and transferring it towards the reaction center where it is converted into chemical energy usable for the cell .",
    "the transfer of energy in such systems is described by electronic exciton - dynamics coupled to the vibrations and other mechanical modes of the complex @xcite .",
    "laser spectroscopy shows quantum coherent effects in the energy transfer in lhc at temperatures up to @xmath0  k @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of model hamiltonians at different levels of approximation @xcite show that the interplay between coherent transport and dissipation leads to high efficiencies in the energy transport in these systems .",
    "lhc provide a remarkable example of systems where noise or dissipation aids the transport .",
    "understanding these systems is relevant as it gives insight into the optimal design of artificial systems such as novel nanofabricated structures for quantum transport or optimized solar cells .",
    "the modelling of lhc is challenging due to the lack of atomistic ab - initio methods and requires to resort to effective descriptions .",
    "this is most apparent in the treatment of the vibrational excitations , which are commonly described by a structureless mode distribution .",
    "then the energy transfer is calculated by the time propagation of a density matrix , which couples the electronic exciton dynamics to the vibrational environment .",
    "for lhc , the rearrangement of the molecular states after the absorption of the photon has to be taken into account and is described by the reorganization energy .",
    "the hierarchical equations of motion ( heom ) @xcite for the time evolution of the density - matrix were adapted by ishizaki and fleming @xcite to include the reorganization process in the transport equations and is exact within the model of exciton dynamics coupled to a bath with a drude - lorentz spectral density .    in principle",
    "the heom can be extended to other spectral densities by using a superposition of drude - lorentz peaks @xcite .",
    "previous calculations for the energy - transfer efficiency of the fmo complex did not consider memory effects and used a weak coupling perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "other models try to get around these limitations by using the generalized bloch - redfield equations @xcite , but yield different results compared to the heom solution of the same model - system . prolonged coherent dynamics is predicted due to the slow dissipation of reorganization energy to the vibrational environment @xcite .",
    "theoretical descriptions must go beyond the rotating - wave approximation , perturbation theory , and require a full incorporation of time non - local effects , and physiological temperature .",
    "the heom fulfill all these premises .    to date",
    ", only the exciton population - dynamics for the fmo model has been studied within the full hierarchical approach @xcite whereas the calculation of efficiency or 2d absorption spectra have been considered out - of - range for present computational power , since they require stable algorithms to propagate enlarged system matrices over many more time - steps .",
    "the adverse computational scaling of the heom stems from the need to propagate a complete hierarchy of coupled auxiliary equations , which need to be simultaneously accessed in memory and propagated in time . the insufficient computational power and memory - transfer bandwidth of conventional cpu clusters @xcite has limited the application of the heom to study energy - transfer efficiency in small dimer systems , where other methods are available for comparison around @xmath1  k @xcite . the advent of high - performance graphics processing units ( gpu ) with several hundred stream - processors working in parallel and with a high - bandwidth memory has lead us to perform the full heom approach for the exciton model of lhc . the efficiency calculations for the fmo system in the strong coupling regime require to propagate 240000 auxiliary matrices up to 50 ps ( corresponding to 20000 time steps ) .",
    "the full heom approach takes only hours of computational time on a single gpu , whereas the corresponding cpu calculation would run several weeks and becomes completely unfeasible for bigger lhc due to the large communication overhead .",
    "we use the gpu algorithmic advance to characterize the exciton energy - transfer efficiency in lhc for a wide range of reorganization energies under full consideration of the memory - effects and at @xmath2  k. our calculations reveal several important mechanisms which are not contained within the approximative methods . the gpu - heom method opens the window to a wide - spread utilization of the heom , including the calculation of two - dimensional non - linear spectra of lhc as we will discuss elsewhere .",
    "also the implementation of a scaled version of the heom @xcite , which reduces the number of auxiliary matrices , could be achieved on a gpu and reduces the computational effort of hierarchical methods further .    for the development of new theoretical chemistry and physics algorithms , gpu",
    "are important devices and considerably enlarge the class of solvable problems if one manages to devise a program code which takes full advantage of the gpu stream - processing architecture . for interacting many - body systems ,",
    "this can not be generally achieved by porting an existing program to the gpu , but requires to follow the vector - programming paradigm from the onset @xcite .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] we set up the model for energy transfer to the reaction center in the fmo complex . in sect .",
    "[ sec : effreorg ] we calculate the key - quantities used to characterize the energy flow , namely the efficiency and the transfer time to the reaction center . we compute them for a wide range of reorganization energies and bath correlation - times within the hierarchical approach .",
    "this section contains a detailed discussion of the differences of the heom results compared to calculations based on approximative methods .",
    "we highlight the main mechanism behind the high efficiency , the delicate balance between the requirements of an energy gradient towards the reaction center and the detuning of the energies , as shown in sect .  [",
    "sec : efflevels ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : efftemp ] we discuss how the transport efficiency is optimized with respect to physiological temperature and comment on the thermalization properties of the heom .",
    "finally we summarize our findings in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . throughout the article",
    ", we provide detailed information about the computational times and requirements and collect in the appendices additional detailed information about the algorithms used and our gpu implementation .",
    "the fmo protein is part of the light harvesting complex that appears in green sulfur bacteria .",
    "its structure has been widely studied both with x - ray and optical spectroscopic techniques @xcite .",
    "it has a trimer structure , with each of the monomers consisting of seven bacteriochlorophyll ( bchl ) pigment molecules , which are electronically excited when the energy flows from the antenna to the reaction center .",
    "an ab - initio calculation of the energy - transfer process within an atomistic model is far beyond present computational capabilities .",
    "instead one has to develop effective model hamiltonians such as the widely used excitonic frenkel - hamiltonian @xcite . within the frenkel model , which assumes that excitations enter the system one at a time , the seven bchl pigments of the fmo complex are treated as individual sites which are coupled to each other and also to the protein environment .",
    "the excitonic hamiltonian is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 corresponds to an electronic excitation of the chromophore bchl@xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes the electronic ground state of the pigment protein complex where we fix the zero of energy @xmath8 .",
    "the site energies @xmath9 of the chromophores consist of the `` zero - phonon energies '' @xmath10 and a reorganization energy @xmath11 , which takes into account the rearrangement of the complex during excitation due to the phonon bath@xcite @xmath12 in the following we will consider identical couplings for all sites , @xmath13 .    the inter site couplings @xmath14 are obtained by fits to experimentally measured absorption spectra  @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we use the designations and parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , table  4 ( trimer column ) and table  1 ( column 4 ) , summarized in [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "a sketch of the dominant couplings is shown in [ fig : sites ] .",
    "sketch of the exciton energies of the fmo complex ( [ tab : tab1 ] ) , the reaction center , and the ground state .",
    "each site , designated with a number , represents a bchl pigment of the fmo complex .",
    "the arrows indicate the dominant inter - site couplings .",
    "the excitation enters the fmo complex through the chlorosome antenna located close to sites  1 and 6 .",
    "the incoming excitation , depicted with wavy arrows pointing upwards , follows two energy pathways to the reaction center .",
    "wavy arrows pointing downwards indicate radiative loss - channels leading to the electronic ground state .",
    "in addition , each site is coupled to a phonon bath which accounts for the protein environment surrounding the pigments . ]",
    "the first step of the algorithm initializes the system of the @xmath16-matrices of the hierarchy . with increasing truncation @xmath17",
    ", the total number of @xmath16-matrices grows factorially @xmath18 , where @xmath19 corresponds to the number of sites @xcite . as shown in [ tab : gpuvscputimeingtab1 ] , the calculation of a population dynamics of the fmo complex with @xmath4 , @xmath20 requires already 50388 matrices whereas 330 matrices are sufficient for a truncation at @xmath21 .",
    "the memory of the @xmath16-matrices is allocated on the graphics - board and initialized to zero .",
    "it is not necessary to transfer the @xmath16-matrices to the main - processor memory at any time during the calculation .",
    "the only memory transfer between cpu and gpu involves the @xmath22 entries of the reduced density operator @xmath23 . to advance the propagation one time - step in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lab8 ] ) requires a large number of matrix multiplications .",
    "each single @xmath16-matrix is connected to @xmath24 neighbors , these connections are stored in gpu memory in a linked - list .",
    "the gpu uses 448 cores in parallel with fast gpu memory transfer and thus provides an immense reduction of the computation time up to a factor of @xmath25 for the matrix multiplications . for benchmarking the algorithm , we propagate 1000 time steps using a 4th order runge - kutta integrator . for the final output into files",
    "requires a short memory transfer from the gpu to the cpu .    in [ tab : gpuvscputimeingtab1 ]",
    "we summarize the computational speed - up of the c2050-gpu compared to a standard cpu ( intel 2.40ghz ) .",
    "the gpu computation is performed using single precision , which yields sufficient accuracy for the problem at hand . for the population dynamics of the fmo complex using @xmath26  @xmath15 , @xmath27  fs , temperature of 300 k , propagation time of 10  ps with step size @xmath28  fs and truncation @xmath20 the populations are accurate within single precision to six digits @xmath29 .",
    "this switch from single for double precision increases the computation time approximately by a factor of two on the c2050-gpu ."
