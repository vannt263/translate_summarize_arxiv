    "the negative-@xmath50 tail is analogous to .",
    "remarkably , the leading front of the traveling wave is perfectly sharp @xcite as the function @xmath80 vanishes beyond the front location !",
    "we view the double exponential decay as a discrete analog of a perfectly sharp front .",
    "moreover , the effective viscosity @xmath81 and the vanishing density ahead of the propagating front are together responsible for the extremely sharp front @xcite .",
    "under the burgers equation , an initial condition with compact support necessarily evolves into a triangular wave .",

    "substitution of into shows that this asymptotic behavior is compatible with the rate equation , and furthermore , yields a quadratic recursion relation for the prefactors , @xmath102 starting with @xmath103 , we can iteratively obtain the prefactors from the explicit formula @xmath104 leading to @xmath105 , @xmath106 , etc . @xcite .",
    "we use a continuum approach to calculate the large-@xmath9 asymptotic behavior of @xmath107 . to obtain the leading asymptotic behavior ,",

    "substitution of and into this sum yields @xmath120 by straightforward asymptotic analysis .",
    "the leading term follows from the continuous behaviors and the extent of the triangular wave specified by .",
    "however , the logarithmic correction , which follows from the coefficient constitutes a departure from the continuous behavior .",
    "we conclude that the triangular wave has the following form @xmath121    we already established the front location @xmath119 and the maximal height of the wave @xmath122 which follows from and .",
    "thus , we anticipate the scaling behavior @xmath123 in the finite neighborhood @xmath124 .",
    "numerical integration confirms this scaling behavior ( figure [ fig - scaling - front ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath30 specifies the shape of the front . by substituting and into the rate equation",
    ", we see that the scaling function @xmath30 satisfies .",

    "this behavior is remarkable in view of the two very different scaling forms and . in particular ,",
    "the leading front is extremely sharp and follows the double exponential decay .",

    "of course , there is a significant difference with the triangular wave above as the extent of the wave is now linear in time .",
    "in addition , there are diffusive boundary layers , for example when @xmath128 .",
    "numerical integration of the rate equation shows that the scaling behavior and the diffusive boundary layer both agree with the continuous case .",
    "in contrast with the traveling and triangular waves above , we can replace the difference equation with the differential equation even inside the front region because the size of the boundary layer grows diffusively with time . however , the discrete and the continuous equations are not equivalent when @xmath129 because of the vanishing viscosity .",
    "integrability is a remarkable feature of the burgers equation : the cole - hopf transformation @xmath130 turns the nonlinear equation into the ordinary diffusion equation @xmath131 .",
    "our discrete equation is not integrable .",
    "interestingly , however , the discrete equation @xmath132 which has a purely quadratic right - hand - side and mimics the nonlinear advection term in the burgers equation , can be linearized .",
    "the transformation @xcite @xmath133 reduces the nonlinear equation into the linear equation @xmath134 . using this transformation ,",
    "equation can be solved exactly for the initial condition . from the solution @xmath135 , the rarefaction wave discussed above follows immediately .",
    "however , the discrete equation does not satisfy continuity . constructing a discrete analog of the burgers equation which satisfies the continuity condition , and in addition ,",
    "can be transformed into a linear equation is an interesting challenge .    in summary",
    ", we introduced a discrete nonlinear equation that captures the key properties of the burgers equation .",
    "intriguingly , the most natural discrete analog of the burgers equation is essentially unique : matching the nonlinear advection term dictates that a viscosity that is equal to the density , @xmath21 .",
    "the discrete equation satisfies the continuity condition and consequently , the mass of an initially localized `` bump '' is conserved .",
    "the mass conservation ensures that the velocity of a traveling wave and the shape of a triangular wave match the continuous behavior , to leading order .",
    "we also find that the shape of a triangular wave is identical to the continuous case .",
    "in contrast with the classic burgers equation , the viscosity equals the density .",
    "this discrepancy results in subtle departures from the continuous behavior : the shape of the traveling wave is asymmetric , and moreover , the front of the wave is extremely sharp with double exponential tail .",
    "further , the front of the triangular wave includes a logarithmic - in - time correction to the leading behavior which is diffusive .                              for the standard poisson process , @xmath136 , the probability distribution function @xmath137 obeys the rate equation @xmath138 .",
    "similarly , the rate equations describe the evolution of the probability density for the `` two - body '' generalization @xmath139",
    ".            in general , propagation from the state @xmath140 into the state @xmath141 occurs with the velocity @xmath142 and the function @xmath30 is always asymmetric .",

    "<S> this ubiquitous equation emerges naturally in the presence of dissipation , and it is broadly used to model traffic flows @xcite , transport processes @xcite , surface growth @xcite , and large scale formation of matter in the universe @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the burgers equation has two important properties . </S>",
    "<S> the first is continuity : equation can be written in the form @xmath2 , hence assuring mass conservation in the absence of sources or sinks . if we view the quantity @xmath3 as a density , then the total mass is a conserved quantity , @xmath4 , as long as the density vanishes , @xmath5 in the limits @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the second property is asymmetry : due to the nonlinear advection term , equation is not invariant with respect to the inversion transformation @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to construct a discrete ( in space ) counterpart of the burgers equation that maintains these two properties . </S>",
    "<S> thus we discretize the spatial coordinate but keep the time variable continuous , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is integer . </S>",
    "<S> the differential equation @xmath10 represents a continuity equation on a one - dimensional lattice . </S>",

    "<S> the result of these two steps is the continuous equation @xmath20 by construction , the nonlinear advection term is the same as in . </S>",

    "<S> , we analyzed the solutions of the discrete equation for the following standard initial conditions @xcite : ( i ) a step function resulting in a traveling wave , ( ii ) a localized delta function leading to a triangular wave , and ( iii ) a complementary step function with an ensuing rarefaction wave . </S>",
    "<S> for all of these cases , we find that the discrete analog faithfully captures the primary features of the continuous burgers equation . however , we also find subtle and interesting departures from the classical solutions in the first two cases . </S>",
