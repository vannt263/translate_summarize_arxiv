    ". the lower limit on the number density can be used with the total h@xmath2 column density to estimate the size of the region where the h@xmath2o absorption occurs . adopting the larger value of @xmath52  @xmath8 , the density limit of @xmath5  @xmath6 results in a path - length limit of @xmath53  cm ( 1.3  au ) .",
    "the weaker density constraints in the scenario where radiative pumping is important relax this size limit to @xmath54  au .",
    "given the high density , high temperature , and small path length , this gas must be located fairly close to the central protostar , likely in the inner envelope or a circumstellar disk .",
    "the physical parameters derived from our analysis can be compared to those found by previous studies of afgl  2136  irs  1 .",
    "water absorption has been observed in this source before via the @xmath240 @xmath23 band near 6  @xmath3 m using iso - sws @xcite",
    ". the lower spectral resolution of that instrument ( @xmath55 ) made it so that all absorption features were blends of several different transitions . in order to determine best - fit parameters , @xcite produced a suite of synthetic spectra arising from different combinations of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( doppler line width ) , and compared them to the observed spectrum . adopting a value of @xmath59  km  s@xmath33 , they found @xmath60 and @xmath61  @xmath8 .",
    "the excitation temperature is in excellent agreement with our findings , but their water column density is about 7 times smaller .",
    "this result was obtained with a model only considering absorption , and @xcite postulated that emission filling in some of the absorption features could result in column densities being underestimated by factors of 36 .",
    "it is unclear to what extent emission competes with absorption in the h@xmath2o spectra presented by @xcite .",
    "if a spherical cloud lies entirely within the telescope beam ( slit ) , then every absorbed photon should be balanced by an emitted photon . because @xmath62 transitions are favored",
    ", @xmath63-branch lines should appear in absorption while @xmath64-branch lines appear in emission  a phenomenon observed in the @xmath240 , @xmath23 band of water toward orion  bn / kl @xcite .",
    "however , the high - mass protostars observed by @xcite show neither this signature nor any clear signs of emission at all . of course , astronomical sources are not idealized spherical objects , and a larger amount of material along the line of sight  e.g . , the disk / torus structure of afgl  2136  irs  1 described in section [ section_source]would preferentially show absorption .",
    "additionally , at very high densities collisional de - excitation of vibrationally excited states could compete with spontaneous emission , again favoring absorption being observed .",
    "our own observations reveal no hint of emission in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands ( although we only cover @xmath63-branch lines ) , and archival texes ( texas echelon cross echelle spectrograph ) observations near 8.5  @xmath3 m show the @xmath23  12@xmath6513@xmath66 transition  a @xmath64-branch line  in absorption . for all of these reasons",
    ", we neglect the possible effects of emission during the analysis of our data .",
    "an alternative probe of density and temperature is co. absorption lines from the @xmath240 and @xmath351 bands of @xmath67co and the @xmath240 band of @xmath68co near 4.7  @xmath3 m were observed toward afgl  2136  irs  1 by @xcite .",
    "lines in the @xmath240 band of @xmath67co are optically thick , so the @xmath68co band is used in their main analysis .",
    "@xcite find both a cold ( @xmath69  k , @xmath70  @xmath8 ) and warm ( @xmath71  k , @xmath72  @xmath8 ) gas component .",
    "the temperature of the warm component is in good agreement with that found by our analysis , and the co abundance , @xmath73@xmath74 assuming @xmath75 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , is indicative of the case where nearly all of the carbon and half of the oxygen are in the form of co , while the remaining oxygen is in h@xmath2o .",
    "additionally , detection of the @xmath351 band of @xmath67co in absorption indicates high density ( @xmath76  @xmath6 ) , as an observable population in the first vibrationally excited state would not otherwise be maintained @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the lower limit we have placed on density .",
    "the same set of observations used in our paper also revealed absorption in both the @xmath240 , @xmath25 and @xmath77 transitions of hf at 20.3  km  s@xmath33 and 24.5  km  s@xmath33 , respectively @xcite .",
    "given the relative populations in these levels , the velocity match between the @xmath77 line and the warm h@xmath2o , and the characteristic @xmath78  km  s@xmath33 shift between the two lines , we concluded that the @xmath25 absorption arises in the cold molecular cloud , while the @xmath77 absorption arises in the same warm gas where we see water .",
    "significant population in the @xmath79 level requires either radiative pumping or high density , @xmath80  @xmath6 @xcite , so the hf results indicate conditions similar to those inferred from h@xmath2o and co.    kinematics in the gas surrounding afgl  2136  irs  1 are also of interest . as mentioned before , there is a slight shift between the velocity found for warm @xmath68co ( @xmath81  km  s@xmath33 ) and the systemic velocity ( @xmath32  km  s@xmath33 ) of the cold cloud surrounding the protostar @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the difference in velocity may indicate that the warm gas is infalling toward the central protostar .",
    "the average velocity found for warm h@xmath2o ( @xmath82  km  s@xmath33 ) is about halfway between the cold cloud and warm @xmath68co velocities , a somewhat puzzling result .",
    "water maser emission at 22.23508  ghz ( @xmath83 ) has been observed toward afgl  2136 in several instances @xcite , with the peak emission between 26.7  km  s@xmath33 and 27.5  km  s@xmath33 .",
    "the interferometric observations of @xcite reveal compact maser emission in a region 600@xmath841000  au around what they dub radio source 4 ( rs4 ) , which is coincident with irs  1 within positional uncertainties .",
    "conditions necessary to produce this maser emission ( @xmath85  k , @xmath86  @xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are similar to those that we have inferred , and @xcite speculated that the h@xmath2o masers may arise in the accretion shock where gas is falling onto the central protostar .",
    "maser emission , h@xmath2o absorption , and co absorption all paint a consistent picture of warm , dense gas very close to and falling toward , if not onto , the central source .",
    "as previously stated , the relative abundance of h@xmath2o with respect to h@xmath2 in the warm gas in protostellar envelopes is expected to be @xmath87 .",
    "the reason for this high water abundance is twofold .",
    "first , when the dust temperature is above about 100  k all of the water ice evaporates , drastically increasing the gas - phase h@xmath2o abundance .",
    "second , when the gas temperature is above about 300  k neutral - neutral reactions of h@xmath2 with o and oh rapidly drive all of the remaining free oxygen into h@xmath2o . chemical models that account for changes in the physical structure of protostellar systems with time predict that as time progresses larger portions of the envelope will be at high temperature @xcite , thus increasing the total gas - phase water abundance and the ratio of gas - to - solid h@xmath2o .",
    "this suggests the gas - to - solid water ratio as a potential tracer of protostellar evolution .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that larger h@xmath2o abundances and larger gas - to - solid ratios correlate with higher temperatures , the presence of molecules that trace more evolved sources , and evidence of thermal processing in ices .",
    "our water observations are consistent with the picture of afgl  2136  irs  1 as a more evolved protostar , and the increased water column density with respect to that reported by @xcite brings the gas - to - solid ratio into better agreement with what those authors found for afgl  2591 and afgl  4176 , two other highly evolved sources .",
    "it is also interesting to compare our results to physical models of protostellar envelopes .",
    "@xcite used dust emission and molecular line emission maps to infer density profiles of the form @xmath88 for several massive protostars . in the case of afgl  2136 they found @xmath89  au , @xmath90  @xmath6 , and @xmath91 , with the model applicable for radii in the range @xmath92 .",
    "the density at the inner radius ( 233  au ) is about @xmath93  @xmath6 , much smaller than the lower limit we infer , and a path length of greater than a few hundred au is necessary to reach a column density comparable to that quoted above for warm h@xmath2 .",
    "however , they also found unresolved compact emission at 86  ghz indicative of a warm dust shell or circumstellar disk with radius @xmath94  au .",
    "such a region seems a favorable place to give rise to the water absorption features that we observe .",
    "the large water column density , @xmath95  @xmath8 , and warm temperature , @xmath96  k , near afgl  2136  irs  1 combine to make absorption lines in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands observable . to determine the utility of such observations in other sources , we briefly examined predicted line strengths given different values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 assuming lte . given the noise level in our spectrum , at 400  k about 75% of the transitions we detected would still be observable , while at 300  k only about 25% would remain observable .",
    "similarly , a reduction in the water column density to @xmath97  @xmath8 drops the number of detecable transitions to about 25% of those observed .",
    "it is no surprise then that our identical observations of elias  29where @xmath98  @xmath8 ; @xmath99  k @xcite  yield no detections of water lines in absorption . on the other hand , our initial observations of afgl  4176 ( @xmath100  @xmath8 ; @xmath101  k ;",
    "* ) do show water absorption near 2.5  @xmath3 m ( to be presented in a future publication ) . clearly , there is a range of temperatures and water column densities over which these observations in the near - ir are currently feasible .",
    "the twelve massive protostars studied by @xcite represent a good sample of sources for initial consideration , with afgl  2591 , ngc  3576 , and afgl  2059 being particularly favorable targets beyond the two already observed . as telescopes and",
    "detectors continue to improve the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands of water should become useful tracers of physical conditions in a wide variety of star - forming regions .",
    "our observations represent the first extensive study of water absorption in the near - infrared . assigning absorption features to 47 separate transitions",
    ", we constructed a rotation diagram which is indicative of lte for levels as high as 4294.5  k above ground .",
    "a statistical equilibrium analysis of all level populations gives best - fit parameters of @xmath4  k , @xmath102  @xmath6 , and @xmath103  @xmath8 .",
    "these conditions are consistent with those inferred from observations of both co in absorption and 22  ghz h@xmath2o maser emission .",
    "warm , very dense gas is in close proximity to afgl  2136  irs  1 and is likely falling toward , if not onto the massive protostar .",
