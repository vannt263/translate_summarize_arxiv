    "imagine a spatial branching process in which the child of an individual either is a homebody , that is , remains at the same site as its parent , or migrates to a new location which has never been occupied before and then founds its own colony .",
    "we assume that the reproduction law is the same for homebodies and migrants and do not depend on the spatial location either , so this is essentially a discrete version of the virgin island model of hutzenthaler @xcite when local competition between individuals is discarded ; see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "the dynamics of the process are entirely determined by the pair @xmath0 of integer valued random variables giving the number of homebody children and the number of migrant children of a typical individual .",
    "the special case where each child chooses to emigrate with a fixed probability @xmath1 and independently of the other children can be interpreted in the framework of the infinite - sites model in population genetics by identifying a spatial location with a locus on a chromosome and @xmath2 with the rate of neutral mutations .",
    "this setting has motivated a number of works in the literature ; see in particular @xcite and @xcite . in a quite different direction",
    ", we may also consider for instance the cut - off situation where there is a threshold  @xmath3 such that the first @xmath3 children of an individual are always homebodies while the next children ( if any ) are forced to migrate .",
    "we may think of many other simple rules as there are no assumptions on the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we are interested in statistics of the decomposition of the entire population according to the locations of individuals , which we call the partition into colonies .",
    "this partition is naturally endowed with a genealogical tree structure which has been described in @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite focused on the special case where neutral mutations occur in a galton  watson process with a fixed reproduction law which is critical and has a finite variance . in asymptotic regimes where the population is large and the mutation rate small ,",
    "we established a weak limit theorem for the tree of alleles , that is , in the present setting , the partition into colonies equipped with its genealogical structure . the limit was described in terms of the genealogical tree of a continuous state branching process in discrete time ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) with an inverse gaussian reproduction measure . in a related direction",
    ", we also point at recent work by abraham and delmas @xcite on pruning lvy continuum random trees .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall investigate more generally asymptotics of the partition into colonies ( ignoring its genealogical structure ) for branching processes with emigration when populations are large and migrations rare .",
    "the regimes of interest are related to the well - known limit theorems for rescaled galton ",
    "watson processes toward continuous state branching processes in continuous time .",
    "our main result ( theorem [ t2 ] ) states that after an appropriate rescaling , the partition into colonies converges weakly to some random point measure .",
    "the latter is constructed from the restriction of a poisson point measure to a certain random region .",
    "an important step in our analysis is that , although in general the cumulant of this limiting random measure is not explicitly known , it can be characterized as the unique solution to a rather simple integral equation .",
    "let us briefly present the plan of this work by explaining our approach . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we point at the fact that the cumulant of the partition into colonies solves a certain integral equation .",
    "this equation stems from the extended branching property that is fulfilled by the partition , and is given in terms of the distribution of a pair of random variables which arise naturally in this setting .",
    "we also recall a useful identity in law which relates the preceding variables to that of passage times in certain random walks .    in section [ sec3 ] , we consider a sequence of branching processes with emigration and introduce the basic assumptions .",
    "these are closely related to the classical limit theorems for rescaled galton ",
    "watson processes and involve lvy processes with no negative jumps . motivated by section [ sec2 ] , we investigate limits in distribution for passage times of random walks , and point at the role of the lvy measure of a bivariate subordinator which arises in this setting .    in section [ sec4 ] , we introduce a family of random point measures which are constructed from poisson point measures on a product space by restriction to certain random domains .",
    "the main feature is that the cumulant of such a random measure can be characterized as the unique solution to another integral equation involving the intensity measure of the underlying poisson measure .",
    "our main result for limits in law of partitions into colonies is presented and proved in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "roughly , we show that the cumulants of the partitions into colonies of a sequence of branching processes with emigration converge after an appropriate rescaling to the unique solution of an equation of the type which appeared in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "more precisely , it corresponds to the case where the intensity of the driving poisson measure is given by the lvy measure that has arisen in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec6 ] is devoted to a few ( hopefully ) interesting examples , partly to demonstrate the variety of possible asymptotic behaviors .",
    "roughly speaking , the common feature in these examples is that the galton ",
    "watson process for which spatial locations of individuals are ignored has a fixed distribution .",
    "we shall consider different natural possibilities for selecting migrants children amongst the progeny of an individual , which will yield different limiting partitions into colonies . in the case corresponding to rare neutral mutations in the infinite alleles branching process",
    ", the limiting random partition can be described in terms of certain poisson  kingman partitions which have been considered by pitman @xcite .",
    "in this section , we briefly introduce notation and present some basic properties for galton  watson processes with emigration and the induced partitions into colonies . the material is essentially adapted from @xcite and @xcite to which we refer for details , with the exception of lemma [ l1 ] which is new .    roughly speaking",
    ", we consider a spatial haploid population model with discrete nonoverlapping generations where each individual begets independently of the others , according to a fixed reproduction law which is independent of the location of that individual .",
    "we do not specify geometrical details of the space where individuals live as this would be irrelevant for the study ; the only implicit assumption is that this space is infinite .",
    "a child can either stay at the same site as its parent or migrate to a new site which has never been occupied before and then found its own colony .",
    "this child is called a _",
    "homebody _ in the first case , and a _ migrant _ in the second . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we shall assume in this work that at the initial time each ancestor lives in a different location , although arbitrary initial conditions could be dealt with more generally .",
    "the law of this model is thus entirely determined by the number of ancestors and a pair of integer - valued random variables @xmath0 which should be thought of as the number of homebody children and the number of migrant children of a typical individual . for every @xmath6",
    ", we use the notation @xmath7 for the probability measure under which this model starts from @xmath8 ancestors .",
    "if spatial locations are discarded , then the total number of individuals per generation clearly forms a standard galton ",
    "watson process with reproduction law given by the distribution of @xmath9 .",
    "we always assume that this galton ",
    "watson process is critical or sub - critical , namely , @xmath10 , and implicitly exclude the degenerate case where @xmath11 , so the population becomes eventually extinct a.s .",
    "the main object of interest in this work is the _ partition into colonies _ , which we represent as a random discrete measure @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the total number of colonies ( that is occupied sites ) and @xmath14 denotes the total number of individuals that lived at the @xmath15th colony .",
    "observe that the first moment of @xmath16 coincides with the total population of the galton ",
    "watson process , namely , @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for the number of children of the @xmath3th individual for some enumeration procedure , and that the mass of @xmath16 is just the number of colonies @xmath19    we denote the cumulant of partition into colonies when there is a single ancestor by @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for a generic function and @xmath22 we also point out from the branching property that for an arbitrary number of ancestors @xmath6 we have @xmath23 hence the cumulant @xmath24 characterizes the law of @xmath16 under @xmath25 for any @xmath26 .",
    "the starting point of our analysis relies on the fact that this cumulant is determined in terms of the distribution of a pair of random variables which appear naturally in the branching process with emigration .",
    "specifically , imagine for a while a variation of the model starting from a single ancestor in which migrants are sterilized ( i.e. , they have no offspring ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath27 the total number of individuals that lived at the same site as the ancestor and by @xmath28 the number of sterilized migrant children . in other words , @xmath27 is the size of the colony generated by the ancestor and @xmath28 the number of colonies which have been founded by migrant children of the ancestral colony .",
    "[ l1 ] for every function @xmath21 , the cumulant @xmath29 of @xmath16 is the unique solution @xmath30 to the equation @xmath31    this stems from the branching property which is inherited by the partition into colonies .",
    "more precisely , we work under @xmath32 and decompose the total population into the ancestral colony and families generated by the migrant children of that colony . because the descent of each migrant child has the same distribution as the initial spatial galton  watson process , independently of the other migrant children and of the homebody offspring of the ancestor ,",
    "this yields @xmath33 we refer to chauvin @xcite for a rigorous formulation of the extended branching property of galton",

    "when @xmath39 , the equation reduces to @xmath40 recall that the galton ",
    "watson process is critical or sub - critical , so @xmath41 according to corollary 1 of @xcite .",
    "it is well known that this ensures uniqueness of the solution to the preceding equation .",

    "we refer to theorem 1(ii ) in @xcite or to proposition 1 in @xcite for an explicit formula for this distribution which is obtained by a combinatorial argument and extends the well - known result of dwass @xcite for the total population of galton  watson processes and passage times of downward skip free random walks . in this direction",
