    "the distribution of supernova remnants ( snrs ) within the galaxy is of interest for a variety of reasons , not least because they are important sources of energy and high energy particles in the galaxy .",
    "i discuss here the observational selection effects that make current catalogues of snrs incomplete , and the difficulties in obtaining distances for most remnants .",
    "both of these issues make it difficult to derive the galactic distribution of snrs directly .",
    "i present constraints on the distribution of snrs with galactocentric radius , by comparison of the distribution of bright remnants with galactic longitude with those expected from simple models .",
    "these results are similar to those presented in @xcite , but here i concentrate more on a discussion of the selection effects that apply to current snr catalogues .",
    "in addition , the analysis presented here excludes the region near @xmath0 , where the observational selection effects are extreme .",
    "i have produced several catalogues of galactic snrs .",
    "the earliest version , from 1984 , contained 145 remnants @xcite .",
    "the number of known remnants has almost doubled in the following 25 years , with the most recent version @xcite containing 274 snrs .",
    "note , however , that there are many other possible and probable remnants that have also been proposed , which are briefly described in the documentation for the web version of the catalogue .",
    "these objects are not included in the main catalogue of 274 remnants , as further observations are required to confirm their nature , or their parameters , e.g.  their full extent .",
    "the largest increases in the number of identified remnants are due to large area galactic radio surveys , e.g.  the effelsberg 2.7-ghz survey and the most survey , see section  [ s : selection ] .",
    "there are two problems that make it difficult to derive the galactic distribution of snrs directly : ( i ) there are significant observational selection effects that means that the catalogue of snrs in incomplete , and ( ii ) distances are not available for all snrs .",
    "these two issues are discussed further in the next two subsections .             at 1  ghz .",
    "( note that the @xmath1- and @xmath2-axes are not on the same scale.),width=491 ]     at 1  ghz .",
    "( note that the @xmath1- and @xmath2-axes are not on the same scale.),width=491 ]      although some snrs have first been identified at other than radio wavelengths , in practice the vast majority have been identified from radio observations ( which , unlike the optical or x - rays , are not affected by absorption ) .",
    "furthermore , it is large - area radio surveys that define the completeness of current snr catalogues , not other ( better ) observations , which cover specific targets , or are of only limited areas of the galactic plane .    for much of the galactic plane ",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4  the deepest , large - scale survey is that made at 2.7-ghz with the effelsberg 100-m telescope ( ) .",
    "the rest of the galactic plane has been covered by a survey at 843  mhz made with most .",
    "both these surveys identified many new snrs , see @xcite and respectively .",
    "new remnants identified from these surveys were added to the 1991 and 1996 versions of my snr catalogue . for a snr to be identified it needs to be bright enough to be distinguished from the galactic background .",
    "the approximate surface brightness limit for the effelsberg 2.7-ghz survey is thought to be about @xmath5 at 1  ghz .    since 1991 , when the new snrs identified in the effelsberg survey were added to the catalogue , an additional 61 snrs have been identified in the region covered by this survey . of these only 5 are brighter than a surface brightness of @xmath5 at 1  ghz ( g0.3@xmath60.0 , g1.0@xmath70.1 , g6.5@xmath70.4 , g12.8@xmath60.0 and g18.1@xmath70.1 ; see @xcite ) , with the brightest being @xmath8 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f : sigma ] , the vast majority of the more recently identified snrs in the effelsberg survey region are fainter than @xmath5 at 1  ghz .",
    "the numbers of catalogued remnants with a surface brightness above @xmath5 at 1  ghz in the 1st and 4th galactic quadrants are 35 and 29 respectively , which are consistent within poisson statistics .",
    "thus i take a surface brightness of @xmath5 at 1  ghz to be the approximate effective @xmath9-limit of the current galactic snr catalogue .",
    "figure  [ f : lb ] shows the observed distribution in galactic coordinates of both ( a ) all catalogued snrs , and ( b ) the 68 snrs brighter than the nominal surface brightness completeness limit of @xmath5 at 1  ghz .",
    "this clearly shows that taking the surface brightness selection into account ",
    "i.e.  considering the brighter remnants only  the distribution of snrs is more closely correlated towards both @xmath10 and the galactic centre than might be thought if all snrs were considered .",
    "this is not surprising , as the lower radio emission from the galaxy in the 2nd and 3rd quadrants , and away from @xmath10 , means it is easier to identify faint snrs in these regions .",
    "it is most difficult to identify snrs close to this nominal surface brightness limit in regions of the galactic plane with bright and complex background radio emission , i.e.  close to the galactic centre .",
    "arcmin.),width=377 ]    additionally , there is a selection effect that means that some small angular size snrs are overlooked .",
    "it is generally necessary to resolve a snr in order to recognise it structure , but not all of the galactic plane has been observed with sufficiently high resolution to resolve the structure of all sources . the effelsberg 2.7-ghz survey has a resolution of 4.3  arcmin , making it difficult to recognised the structure of a remnant unless it is @xmath11  arcmin or larger in extent .",
    "this means that there is a deficit of small angular size snrs , which is illustrated by figure  [ f : theta ] .",
    "this shows the surface - brightness versus angular diameter for the smaller snrs in the current galactic snr catalogue .",
    "the remnants of ` historical ' supernovae chronicled in the last thousand years or so are indicated .",
    "all these remnants are relatively close - by , as otherwise their parent supernova would not have been seen visibly , and therefore they sample only a small part of the galactic disk .",
    "if these known young remnants were further away , they would have the same surface brightness , but would be smaller in angular size . although there are some such remnants currently known ",
    "e.g.  the very young snr g1.9 + 0.3 ( see @xcite )  there are fewer than expected ( see further discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "hence there is a selection effect against the identification of young but distant snrs in the galaxy .",
    "note that most of these missing young remnants will be on the far side of the galaxy , and therefore appear nearer @xmath10 and to @xmath0 .",
    "this is the region of the galactic plane where the background is brightest , and where there is also more likely to be confusion with other galactic sources along the line of sight .    of the 5 sources brighter than @xmath5 ",
    "i.e.  above the nominal surface brightness limit of the current snr catalogue  which have been identified since 1991 in the effelsberg survey area , all are close ( within @xmath12 ) to the galactic centre . moreover , 3 of them are small , @xmath13  arcmin in diameter .",
    "thus , it is likely that the sample of 68 ` bright ' snrs may be somewhat incomplete near the galactic centre , due to ( i ) missing young but distant remnants , and ( ii ) the difficulty of identifying remnants near the surface brightness limit in this region of the galaxy , with a relativity bright and complex background .",
    "the 2009 version of the catalogue includes remnants identified in the refereed literature published up to the end of 2008 .",
    "since then some other remnants have been identified ( e.g.  g25.1@xmath72.3 and g178.2@xmath74.2 , ; g35.6@xmath70.4 , @xcite ; g64.5 + 0.9 , @xcite ; g296.7@xmath70.9 , @xcite ; g308.3@xmath71.4 , @xcite ; g310.5@xmath60.8 , ) , but none of these are clearly brighter than @xmath5 at 1  ghz .      to directly construct the galactic distribution of snrs",
    "it is necessary to know the distance to each remnant .",
    "distances are only available for about 20% of currently known snrs , and so the surface brightness  linear diameter  or ` @xmath14 '  relation has often been used instead .",
    "this provides an estimated linear size for a remnant from its _ observed _ surface brightness , using the @xmath14 correlation seen for snrs with known distances .",
    "this correlation is usually parameterised as @xmath15 as physically small snrs tend to have larger surface brightnesses than larger ones . as is discussed in @xcite ,",
    "much of this correlation is arguably due to a @xmath16 bias due to the fact that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the luminosity of the remnant . in practice",
    ", however , there are several issues with the ` @xmath14 ' relation .",
    "first , snrs show a wide range of physical diameters for a given surface brightness , approximately an order of magnitude in range .",
    "this means that a distance derived for an individual remnant is quite inaccurate .",
    "second , due to the observational selection effect discussed above , the range of properties of snrs may be larger than is evident from currently identified remnants , as small angular size , faint remnants are particularly difficult to identify .",
    "third , as has been discussed in @xcite , some ` @xmath14 ' studies have used inappropriate least - square straight line regressions . as there is a larger scatter in the @xmath14 plane ,",
    "regressions minimising deviations in @xmath9 give quite a different correlation than one minimising deviations in @xmath19 ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "since the @xmath14 relation is used to predict a value for @xmath19 from the @xmath9 value for an individual remnant , then minimising deviations in @xmath19 should be used .",
    "@xcite minimised the deviations in @xmath9 , and obtained a @xmath14 relation with @xmath20 ( for 37 ` shell ' remnants , including cas  a ) , whereas a significantly steeper relation with @xmath21 is obtained if deviations in @xmath19 are used .",
    "this means that fainter remnants  which are the majority , see figure  [ f : sigma ]  have their diameters , and hence distances , _ overestimated _ if a @xmath14 relation minimising deviations in @xmath9 is used .",
    "the direct approach to deriving the distribution of galactic snrs is to use the @xmath14 relation to derive distances to individual remnants , and then construct the 3-d distribution of remnants .",
    "however , because of the large range of diameters shown for remnants with similar surface brightnesses , the @xmath14 relation does not provide reliable distances to individual remnants .",
    "moreover there are the observational selection effects discussed in section  [ s : selection ] , which mean that it is not possible to use treat catalogued remnants with equal weight .",
    "instead , the approach i use is to consider only brighter remnants above the nominal surface - brightness limit , and compare their distribution in galactic longitude with that expected from various models",
    ". this approach does not need distance estimates for individual snrs .",
    "because of the possible remaining selection effects close to the galactic centre , the region @xmath22 is excluded from the analysis presented here , leaving 56 brighter remnants",
    ".    , for the three power - law / exponential models shown in figure  [ f : sd ] and discussed in section  [ s : gd ] : dotted line for @xcite s distribution ( a ) , and dashed lines for models ( b ) and ( c).,width=415 ]    one model from the distribution of snrs ( and other star formation tracers , e.g.  pulsars and star formation regions , see ) is a two parameter power - law / exponential radial distribution for the density of snrs with galactocentric radius , @xmath23 , of the form @xmath24\\ ] ] ( with @xmath25  kpc , the distance to the galactic centre ) . the observed distribution in @xmath1 of snrs with @xmath26 from @xcite excluding those with @xmath27 is shown in figure  [ f : sd ] , along with the distributions from three different power - law / exponential radial models .",
    "the models are ( a ) @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( i.e.  the distribution obtained by @xcite ) , ( b ) @xmath30 , @xmath29 ( i.e.  the same value for @xmath31 as in ( a ) , but adjusting @xmath32 for a best least square fit between the observed and cumulative distributions ) , and ( c ) @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( i.e.  the same value for @xmath32 as in ( a ) , but adjusting @xmath31 for a best fit ) . from figure",
    "[ f : sd](a ) it is clear that the power - law / exponential distribution obtained by @xcite , is broader than the observed distribution of ` bright ' snrs above the nominal surface brightness limit of current snr catalogues ( which is to be expected , given the systematic effect due to the regression used by @xcite noted in section  [ s : sigmad ] ) .",
    "models ( b ) and ( c ) have very similar least squares differences from the observed cumulative distribution , but correspond to somewhat different distributions in galactocentric radius .",
    "figure  [ f : radial ] shows the distribution of galactic snrs against galactocentric radius for the three models .",
    "this shows that there is degeneracy between the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath31 in the power - law / exponential distribution model .",
    "the lack of distances to most known galactic snrs , plus observational selection effects , means that it is difficult to derive the distribution of snrs in our galaxy directly .",
    "however , by considering ` bright ' snrs ",
    "i.e.  those not strongly affected by selection effects  constraints on the galactic distribution of snrs can be obtained , by comparison of their @xmath1-distribution with that expected from models .",
    "this shows that the galactic distribution of snrs obtained by @xcite is too broad .",
