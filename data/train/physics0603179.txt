    "two of the main features of the real world networks are the small world effect and the high clustering to be considered in this paper by introducing a randomness @xmath6 , the fraction of the randomly chosen bystanders to the @xmath0 bystanders per accident , which plays a similar role to that of watts - strogatz model @xcite . the original dimensionless model for the bystander effect",
    "is extended to the more realistic and general one in section [ sect:3 ] .",
    "recently in order to investigate an effect of social interaction on the bystanders intervention in emergency situations a rescue model ( rm ) was introduced @xcite .",

    "the rm focuses on the relations between agents rather than on agents themselves , so defined is a relation spin between two agents as @xmath7 whose value is @xmath8 if agent @xmath9 ( agent @xmath10 ) has succeeded in rescuing agent @xmath10 ( agent @xmath9 ) , and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "@xmath7 is symmetric and can be interpreted as an element of adjacency matrix of helping network .",
    "each agent @xmath9 has its intervention threshold @xmath12 over which that agent can try to intervene in an emergency situation .    at each time",

    "we fix @xmath31 for all @xmath9 according to the experimental result @xcite that @xmath32 of isolated subjects intervened and @xmath33 does not change through this paper , which means we consider a population composed of homogeneous non - adaptive agents",
    ". finally , the initial conditions are @xmath34 for all pairs .    at",
    "first let us consider the case without the coupling effect among bystanders , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath35 .",
    "generally , an equation for the network density can be written as @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 denotes the probability of creating a new link between the victim and the bystander and @xmath39 does that of eliminating the existing link between them . the stationarity condition for @xmath40 yields @xmath41 which says @xmath40 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath0 . in the numerical simulations @xmath42 fluctuates around @xmath40 since",
    "the links are added or removed with finite probabilities @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , so does the probability that two connected agents , one as a victim and the other as a bystander , get involved in an accident again . according to the intervener selection rule one of the bystanders connected with the victim must intervene and thus there is no reason for the increase in @xmath40 according to @xmath0 . consequently the helping network gets sparse with the number of bystanders .",
    "an equivalent of the success rate defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sk ] ) is given by @xmath45 where we used the stationary solution for @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ak ] ) .",
    "@xmath46 turns out to be independent of @xmath0 and of the network density too .",
    "in fact , for the sparser network each link should bear the more burden on the intervention to ensure the success rate constant of @xmath0 . from a viewpoint of the uncertainty of a victim s receiving help from the bystanders",
    "@xmath40 corresponds to the cost that the victim should pay to minimize the uncertainty .",
    "if the coupling effect among bystanders is taken into account , then from the definition of @xmath17 the condition for the successful intervention can be obtained by a mean - field approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ the substitution of @xmath40 for each @xmath7 : @xmath47 or @xmath48 at any time step , when given @xmath40 the success rate corresponds to @xmath49 . in case with @xmath50",
    "there appear two transition points @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mf ] ) . at @xmath53 for any accident the rescue succeeds , @xmath54 , if and only if @xmath55 while at @xmath56 for any accident the rescue fails , @xmath57 , if and only if @xmath58 . in the range of @xmath59 , it is evident that @xmath60 , @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "once @xmath33 is larger than @xmath63 , then the helping network is so dense that the probability that the bystander who has not been connected with the victim intervenes is extremely low , so is the possibility of creating a new link .",
    "one can expect that @xmath42 increases since @xmath60 , but very slowly since the network is sufficiently dense .",
    "given @xmath64 we can calculate the time evolution of @xmath42 by considering only the @xmath65 . in case that the victim is not connected with any of bystanders , if we assume that at least one bystander is connected with all other bystanders , then for @xmath66 , @xmath67 taking @xmath68 as an initial condition yields @xmath69^{-1/(k-1)}. \\label{eq : akt}\\ ] ] therefore @xmath70 for @xmath66 .",
    "this solution represents the monotonically increasing behavior of the network density with time step and the @xmath0 dependence as well .",
    "the time series of @xmath42 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : akt ] verify the above arguments except that the transition occurs at @xmath71 larger than @xmath72 expected by the mean - field approximation because of the finite size effect .",
    "one can see from the fig .",
    "[ fig : ask ] that as the system size increases , the transition point approaches @xmath73",
    ". additionally @xmath42 exhibits the punctuated equilibrium - type behaviors at @xmath0 slightly smaller than the transition point @xmath72 , which will be revised in relation to the network viewpoint .",
    "figure [ fig : ask ] shows the numerical results for @xmath46 and @xmath40 , both of which decrease until @xmath0 reaches @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "this tendency can be interpreted as the bystander effect in that the bystanders are less likely to intervene in emergencies ( succeed in rescuing the victim in our model ) when others are present than when they are alone .",
    "contrary to the case with @xmath76 the decreasing @xmath40 according to @xmath0 has an additional negative effect on the coupling among bystanders due to the positive @xmath28 , thus lowers the degrees of willingness @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xvi ] ) and consequently @xmath46 .",
    "however , @xmath46 and @xmath40 are getting large as @xmath0 approaches @xmath72 because of the excitatory coupling among bystanders .",
    "next , let us focus on the effects of the acquaintance strength @xmath25 and the coupling strength @xmath28 on the structure of helping networks . if @xmath77 , since the degrees of willingness for all bystanders are the same as @xmath78 , the helping network shows a completely random structure . if we consider the acquaintance effect , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath79 , the probability that two connected agents get involved in an accident again increases . therefore @xmath25 has a ` fixation ' effect on the helping network . if the coupling among bystanders is taken into account , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath80 , the probability that the bystander connected with more other bystanders is more likely to intervene in an emergency , thus @xmath28 has an effect of ` preferential attachment ( pa ) ' on the helping network . as a result of the pa the heterogeneous hubs and hierarchical structures emerge from the homogeneous non - adaptive population .",
    "the pa has been investigated and summarized in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition , interestingly the above punctuated equilibrium - type behaviors of @xmath42 in fig . [",
    "fig : akt ] accompany the rises and falls of hubs when they undergo the slow saturations punctuated by the abrupt declines .",
    "the nontrivial total collapse of helping networks can result from the chain reaction between the effect of cutting links due to the rescue failure and that of the rescue failure due to the increasing negative interaction among bystanders .",
    "this phenomenon is very different from those of other cases in which once one agent becomes a hub , it lasts forever .",
    "in the previous section we ignored the spatial property of the system which does matter in realities . for more realistic consideration the randomness @xmath81 $ ] is introduced : when assumed that the agents are located on a one - dimensional periodic lattice ( ring ) , the @xmath82 among @xmath0 bystanders are randomly chosen from a whole population , which can be called the _ random bystanders _ , and the @xmath83 bystanders are chosen in the order in which they are nearest to the victim in the euclidean space , which can be called the _ near bystanders_. the near bystanders are to the local neighborhoods what the random ones are to the travelers from other places and so on .",
    "the randomness @xmath6 makes the long - range interaction possible and plays the similar role in our model to the randomness defined as a control parameter of watts - strogatz small world networks @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the case with @xmath84 which means that all the bystanders are the near ones . in case of even @xmath0 ,",
    "one half of bystanders are left to the victim and the other half are right to the victim . in case of odd @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath85 bystanders are chosen as for the case of even @xmath0 except that the side of the last ( farthest ) bystander is chosen randomly , that is , left or right to the victim .",
    "we define a new observable @xmath86 as following : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a ceiling function and the denominator is the maximum number of links limited by the locality of interaction . by the definition of @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath89 in case with @xmath76 , since equations ( [ eq:1])-([eq:2 ] ) for the case without locality , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath90 , are valid for @xmath86 , it is natural to regard @xmath86 as @xmath90 .",
    "thus for small values of @xmath0 the network for the case limited by locality becomes much sparser than that for the case without locality .",
    "interestingly @xmath91 turns out to be independent of @xmath0 again , precisely @xmath92 .",
    "similar to the reason for the @xmath0 independence of @xmath46 , in one - dimensional rescue model the probability that two connected agents get involved in an accident again is very high , thus the helping network gets sparse and as a result each link bears more burden on the intervention .    in case with @xmath80 the helping networks in the one - dimensional world consist of a few hubs induced by the pa effect and their peripheries .",
    "the number of hubs amounts to about @xmath93 and the number of peripheries per hub does to about @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : helpnet ] .",
    "once the degrees of any agents become larger than those of others by chance , they eventually grow to the hubs and intervene in emergencies involved with their own peripheries and vice versa , which forms some kind of helping communities . in addition",
    "although the helping network in fig . [ fig : helpnet ] ( b ) does not show the scale - free behavior of degree distribution its backbone structure bears some resemblance to that of the structured scale - free network @xcite ( see fig . 8 in @xcite for comparison ) .",
    "the network densities and the success rates are scanned for the entire ranges of the number of bystanders @xmath0 and the randomness @xmath6 . when @xmath76 the numerical results depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : asb0 ] show the trivial behaviors . for each @xmath0 , according to @xmath6 the network density @xmath94 leaps from @xmath95 to about @xmath90 as soon as at least one random bystander appears , where @xmath96 or @xmath97 . for the values of @xmath98",
    "the network densities rarely change regardless of @xmath6 , which implies that what is relevant is only whether the interaction is local or not and the other factors do not matter .",
    "the uncertainty of receiving help is maximized at @xmath99 and @xmath100 , where there is only one bystander chosen completely randomly per accident .",
    "therefore the network density should be maximized to ensure the success rate . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : asb0 ] ( b ) , @xmath101 is independent of @xmath0 as well as of @xmath6 since the coupling effect among bystanders is not taken into account .",
    "if the coupling effect among bystanders is considered then an interesting phenomenon is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : asb001 ] , that is , there appears another peak of @xmath94 and @xmath101 in the vicinity of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . to understand the new peak in the intermediate range of both @xmath0 and @xmath6 we focus on a cooperative or competitive interaction between two groups ; group of near bystanders and that of random ones . based on the relevance of positive @xmath28 we conjecture that the clustered structure of near bystanders is essential to enhance the random bystanders intervention and their possibility of success so that the overall network density dominated by the nonlocal links can grow to a large value .",
    "when @xmath0 fixed such as @xmath74 , for small @xmath6 ( large @xmath102 ) local interactions among clustered near bystanders dominate nonlocal interactions among random ones and those across near and random ones , where the locality restrains the network density from getting large . for intermediate @xmath6 and @xmath102 the random bystanders",
    "are benefited from the clustered near ones by making use of the existing links across near ones and random ones near to the near ones and then the range of interaction is expanded to the whole system after all . consequently the network density becomes large . finally , for large @xmath6 ( small @xmath102 ) the near bystanders rarely cluster",
    "so that the random ones can not be benefited from the clustering of near ones , hence the network density will converge to @xmath90 rather than increase .    to verify the above conjecture , at first two network densities",
    "are newly introduced : @xmath103 where @xmath104 gives the shorter distance on the ring between agent @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the superscripts @xmath105 and @xmath106 represent the near and random bystanders respectively .",

[",
    "fig : near_rand ] ( a ) @xmath109 jumps to about @xmath111 very quickly and fluctuates around that value for a while until @xmath110 grows exponentially to exceed @xmath109 , which is called the intersection point .",
    "@xmath110 increases fast then saturates while @xmath109 also increases a little . to figure out whether two bystander groups cooperate or compete we calculate the cross - correlations between two network densities before and after the intersection point . before that point",
    "the cross - correlation is @xmath112 while after that point it is @xmath113 . in the early stage",
    "the near bystanders help the random ones intervene but once the random ones dominate the near ones , two groups compete for the chance of intervention .    for more specific investigation",
    "we calculate the averaged degree of willingness of random bystanders @xmath114 as a function of time and that of near ones @xmath115 respectively as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : near_rand ] ( b ) . similar to the time evolution of @xmath110 ,",
    "@xmath114 increases from a lower value than @xmath115 then exceeds it at the intersection point while @xmath115 fluctuates around some value .",
    "@xmath116 larger than @xmath117 implies the more chance of random bystanders intervention than that of near ones intervention . as a result",
    "the success rate of random ones ( @xmath118 ) is also slightly larger than that of near ones ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the difference of two averaged degrees of willingness affects which kind of bystanders are more likely to intervene and succeed , which affects the network density and the success rate successively . for general @xmath0 by mean - field approximation",
    "the degrees of willingness are given by @xmath120 where we have assumed that the probability that a random bystander is connected with any other bystander is the same as @xmath94 and for the near bystanders the probability to be connected with any other one is @xmath121 . from these the mean - field network density",
    "is obtained : @xmath122 the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig : near_rand ] ( c ) for eq .",

    "the clustering of near bystanders rarely contributes to the random ones intervention because the network is relatively dense to ensure the success rate for small @xmath0 .",
    "therefore it is the locality that is relevant for the results as for the case with @xmath76 . for larger values of @xmath0 ,",
    "especially larger than @xmath72 , we already know the network density goes to @xmath8 but very slowly when @xmath100 .",
    "since for small @xmath6 the network density converges to some value , there should be a transition line where the clustering can not exist , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath124 , equivalently @xmath125 . when @xmath126 and @xmath127 the locality limits the long - range excitatory interaction among bystanders and at the same time the probability that the victim and the bystander are already connected is relatively high due to large @xmath0 so that it is difficult for near bystanders to form an effective cluster and thus to enhance the random ones intervention too .",
    "next , as initial conditions we take the random networks whose network density @xmath128 varies from @xmath129 to @xmath130 . only for the small value of @xmath128 , precisely @xmath129",
    ", there appears the tiny peak in the intermediate range of @xmath0 and @xmath6 while no peak appears in the other cases with larger @xmath128 .",
    "this is because the initial random structure does not allow any structural change for the clustering of near bystanders . in conclusion ,",
    "the new peak in an intermediate range of @xmath0 and @xmath6 has been made sense by introducing the clustering effect of near bystanders .    finally it is also observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphabeta ] that increasing @xmath25 and @xmath28 lead to the overall increase in the height of peak of network density then change the shape of peak from a sharp one to a plateau .",
    "since @xmath25 has a fixation effect on the existing victim - bystander link it can not contribute to the creation of new link but only can lower the possibility of deleting the existing link . on the other hand @xmath28 in relation to the bystander - bystander links can lead to the creation of new link between victim and bystander and the deletion of existing link depending on the network density .",
    "therefore around the peak increasing @xmath28 enhances the successful interventions of random bystanders based on the clustered near ones , then raises the network densities , which are also preserved by increasing @xmath25 .",
    "in this paper we have studied not only the original rescue model , which was introduced in order to investigate an effect of social interaction on the bystanders intervention in emergency situations , but also the rescue model on a small world .",
