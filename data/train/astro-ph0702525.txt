    "intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) are a class of objects with masses larger than standard stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ) , but much smaller than the @xmath3 of supermassive black holes detected in the centers of galaxies , including our own milky way .",
    "the masses of stellar bhs are expected theoretically to span a range between roughly @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these stellar - mass bhs are the end points of stellar evolution for sufficiently massive stars formed out of metal enriched gas . at _",
    "zero metallicity _ , much more massive stars and black holes may be forming .",
    "indeed it has been suggested that zero - metallicity stars can form with masses of @xmath5 , and produce imbhs directly as a result of stellar evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "imbhs can be remnants of zero - metallicity ( population iii ) massive stars of different origin .",
    "the first possibility is that imbhs are produced by primordial population iii stars at early stages of galaxy formation and some could be left wandering in galactic halos , as suggested by numerical simulations ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "due to the so - called gravitational rocket mechanism @xcite , imbhs could receive kick velocities high enough to prevent their merging into the central galactic bh , but small enough not to leave the potential well of the galaxy .",
    "calculations by @xcite indicate that the number of such `` relic '' imbhs in the internal parts of a typical galactic halo can amount to a few dozens per galaxy .",
    "the second scenario is based on the recent suggestion by @xcite that about 10 - 30% of stars in galactic discs at @xmath6  -  4 can be born from primordial gas due to inefficient mixing of the interstellar medium .",
    "if evolution of the most massive of these stars leads to the formation of imbhs , they should be left inside the galactic disc and have the low velocity dispersion typical of galactic disc populations .",
    "imbhs can capture stellar companions due to dynamical interactions and appear as accreting sources @xcite .",
    "for imbhs formed in young , dense stellar clusters , these processes were considered by .",
    "these authors concluded that the dynamical formation of binaries with accreting imbhs , observable as bright ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) in stellar clusters , is very inefficient . in this paper",
    "we further study this suggestion , focusing on the possible formation of ulxs in binary systems as a result of dynamical interactions of imbhs with the galactic disc population .",
    "ulxs are bright point - like objects observed in external galaxies .",
    "they are considered to form a separate class of objects apparently associated with young stellar populations .",
    "ulxs are characterized by high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath7    @xmath8 erg  s@xmath1 ) and often strong variability @xcite .",
    "the observed number of ulxs is about 0.1 per galaxy for @xmath9 erg  s@xmath1 and 0.01 per galaxy for @xmath10 erg  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the nature of ulxs is unclear .",
    "two competitive hypothesis ( see @xcite for a recent review ) suggest that either these sources are accreting binary systems with stellar - mass black holes and significant collimation of radiation ( like ss433 in our galaxy ) seen along the jet axis @xcite , or they are manifestations of intermediate mass black holes with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the first hypothesis is supported by observations of emission nebulae around some of these sources similar to that observed around ss433 ( see @xcite and references therein for more details ) , while the imbh hypothesis is advocated by observations of @xmath12 s quasi - periodic x - ray oscillations in at least one source @xcite",
    ". observations of specific x - ray spectral features forming in the funnel of supercritical accretion disc seen along the jet may be crucial in distinguishing between these two possibilities @xcite . for ulx sources which do not display a rapidly variable luminosity , another possible model is that of very young , fast rotating pulsars , whose x - ray luminosity is powered by their rotational energy ( perna & stella 2004 ) .",
    "if accretion is the source of energy , the observed x - ray luminosity @xmath13 erg  s@xmath1 suggests an accretion rate onto the compact star of @xmath14  yr@xmath1 ( assuming 10% efficiency ) .",
    "volonteri & perna ( 2005 ) investigated the possibility that ulxs can be associated to wandering imbhs which accrete material from the surrounding interstellar medium ( see also islam , taylor & silk 2004 ; mii & totani 2005 ; mapelli , ferrara & rea 2006 ) .",
    "these calculations showed that the typical accretion rate is too low to produce bright ulxs , unless the wandering imbhs carry a substantial baryonic core with them ( e.g. the stripped remnants of the original host galaxy of the wandering bh ) .    a different route which could provide a high accretion rate for imbhs is mass transfer from a companion at an advanced evolutionary stage .",
    "there are two possibilities for an imbh to capture a companion star : tidal interactions with single stars and exchange interactions with binary systems .",
    "tidal interactions are efficient for sufficiently close fly - bys ( at a distance of the order of a few stellar radii ) , so the tidal capture rate is fairly small even for low velocity dispersion in the galactic disc ; in addition , the tidal destruction of the entire captured star is very likely .",
    "the advantage of tidal captures is that sufficiently close binaries with imbhs are formed and are likely to become bright x - ray sources .    in the case of exchange interactions ,",
    "the characteristic cross - section is larger than for tidal captures ",
    "it scales in proportion to the binary semi - major axis .",
    "this increases the probability of interaction between an imbh and the binary star . on the other hand , _",
    "i ) _ for large relative velocities between imbhs and binaries , only a small fraction of sufficiently close systems ( called `` hard '' , see below ) can produce bound binaries after interaction , thus decreasing the effective cross - section ; _ ii ) _ after the exchange of the components , the binary s semi - major axis increases thus decreasing the chances for the imbh in such a binary to become a bright x - ray source .",
    "in this paper we study both processes of formation and evolution of binaries with imbhs in galactic discs using population synthesis calculations .",
    "high - velocity halo imbhs will be considered , as well as low - velocity imbhs formed in the galactic disc .",
    "our model includes the following steps .",
    "* we specify the population of imbhs and its properties . for halo imbhs",
    "we use the spatial distribution and velocities calculated by @xcite as initial conditions , and keep pace with their trajectories in the galactic potential over @xmath15  yrs , selecting the crossings of the disc plane . for disc imbhs , we follow the proposal by @xcite and consider their formation from massive stars as described below (  2.2 ) . *",
    "we calculate the exchange interactions of imbhs with different binary systems or tidal captures of single stars in the disc . * using a modified version of the scenario machine ",
    "the binary population synthesis code @xcite  we calculate the subsequent evolution of captured systems . *",
    "summing up all probabilities for a given imbh to appear as ulx in a binary formed during all disc crossings , and making appropriate normalizations , we calculate the expected number of ulxs in a typical spiral galaxy with assumed constant star formation .",
    "the initial spatial and velocity distributions of imbhs are taken from the numerical calculations by @xcite .",
    "coordinates and velocities of these imbhs have been taken from a stationary distribution corresponding to the present time ( i.e. to the redshift @xmath16 ) .",
    "we have selected only those imbhs which were found inside the region bounded by galactocentric distance @xmath17  kpc in the galactic plane and height @xmath18  kpc over the galaxy plane .",
    "this choice reflects the model density profile adopted for the galaxy stellar disc ( exponential disc , with scale length 7.7 kpc and scale height 1.53 kpc ) . with this parameter choice ,",
    "the stellar density at @xmath19 kpc becomes extremely small , so that the probability of capturing a companion is negligible .",
    "our test demonstrated that imbhs initially outside @xmath18  kpc contribute very little to the number of galactic plane crossings .",
    "the number of imbhs within this spatial boundaries in a milky way sized galaxy strongly depends on the assumed density peak cut during hierarchical clustering .",
    "if imbh formation happens only in rare 3.5  @xmath20 density peaks , the average number of wandering imbhs with @xmath17  kpc and @xmath18  kpc is 1.3 @xcite .",
    "we also made a run for imbhs originated from more common 3@xmath20 peaks . in that case",
    "there are on average 126 imbhs per galaxy .",
    "after the initial velocity and position of an imbh are selected , we let the imbh orbit to evolve in the galactic potential .",
    "the motion of each imbh is traced for @xmath15  yrs with a time step of @xmath21  yrs .",
    "the large integration time is chosen to increase the number of galactic disc crossings , as we have only several dozens imbhs from direct numerical simulations ; with the typical imbh orbital period of several @xmath22 yrs , we expect up to several thousand crossings in our calculations .",
    "this artificial increase in the number of trials helps to obtain statistically significant results when calculating dynamical interactions with stars .",
    "the final results are normalized appropriately .",
    "trajectories of imbhs are calculated in a way similar to that used in calculations of the spatial evolution of isolated neutron stars in our galaxy ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we made use of the axisymmetric galactic potential initially proposed by @xcite .",
    "the potential includes three parts : disc , spheroid and halo , which are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "imbhs mostly cross the galactic plane at small ( @xmath23  kpc ) galactocentric radii ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . spatial velocities of imbhs at each galactic plane crossing are collected and used for the calculation of exchange interactions with binaries and tidal captures of stars . typical orbital periods of these imbhs are about @xmath24 years , while their velocities at the galactic plane crossings are @xmath25 300 - 400 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "peaks ) cross the galactic plane . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]      according to @xcite , a fraction of about 10 - 30% of gas in galaxies can preserve primordial ( low - metallicity ) composition at @xmath26    4 .",
    "the most massive stars formed from such a pristine gas can produce imbhs at the end of evolution . adopting a galactic star formation rate of 1 @xmath27 per year for @xmath28 yrs ( as in @xcite ) , and using 0.1 for the fraction of primordial gas content",
    ", we obtain that @xmath29 of gas in the galaxy is transformed into zero - metallicity stars at @xmath30 .",
    "to estimate the number of imbhs formed in this way , we need to specify the initial mass function , the mass interval(s ) in which bhs are formed , and the bh masses .",
    "the initial mass function is taken in a power - law form : @xmath31 two values of the index @xmath32 were considered : 2.35 ( the classical salpeter value ) and @xmath33 .",
    "the second choice is motivated by the possibility of a significant flattening of the initial mass function for very massive stars which can lead to the increase of the number of ulxs in simulations .",
    "for example , the extreme variant @xmath34 ( flat initial mass function ) was discussed , for example , by @xcite .",
    "the mass range of zero - metallicity stars which evolve into black holes was chosen to consist of two intervals : from 30 to 140 @xmath35 and from 260 to 1000 @xmath35  @xcite . inside the first mass interval",
    ", we assumed @xmath36 , while inside the second interval @xmath37 .",
    "this specific choice , however , does not affect our results significantly .",
    "neither does the choice of the upper mass limit ( for example , 500  @xmath35 as in @xcite ) because the stellar initial mass function rapidly decreases towards higher values .",
    "the velocity distribution of disc imbhs was assumed to be maxwellian with a characteristic velocity dispersion of 10 km  s@xmath1 , which is typical for young massive stars in the galactic disc .",
    "we assume that the velocity dispersion remains constant with time and do not trace the individual motion of such imbhs .",
    "this means that we neglect the possible dynamical heating of the imbh population ; any increase of the velocity dispersion , however , would reduce the efficiency of the dynamical interactions of imbhs with stars .",
    "the probability of a dynamical interaction @xmath38 between an imbh and a ( binary ) star in a time interval @xmath39 is : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the characteristic time of interaction , @xmath42 is the local stellar density , @xmath20 is the cross section of the interaction , and @xmath43 is the relative velocity of imbhs and the ( binary ) star at infinity .",
    "we have used two fitting formulas for the exchange cross section : one proposed by @xcite and one by @xcite .",
    "@xcite simulated encounters between `` hard '' binaries with equal mass binary components ( @xmath44 ) and intruders with extreme masses relative to the masses of the components . in the limiting case of large imbh mass ( @xmath45 ) , the mean time ( @xmath46 ) of the exchange interaction can be estimated as @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the semimajor axis of the binary .",
    "@xcite calculated the exchange cross section in the limit of very low - speed intruders only .",
    "these authors , however , expanded their calculations for a wide range of mass ratios .",
    "the equation obtained by @xcite for the exchange cross section has a complicated dependence on the masses of all interacting systems .",
    "let @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the ejected component , @xmath54 is imbh .",
    "then @xmath55 @xmath56    this formula fits 75% of the numerical calculations to better than 20% ; larger discrepancies are restricted to mass ratios where the cross sections are probably too small to be of importance in applications .",
    "hut et al .",
    "have also compared their formula with results obtained by other authors , and found that the agreement is generally satisfactory .",
    "the results of our calculations presented below also do not depend significantly on the details in the formula for the exchange cross section , i.e. , we obtain similar numbers of ulxs using eq .",
    "( 3 ) and eq .  (",
    "imbhs should tidally interact with single stars , too .",
    "a detailed description of the dissipation in the tidal capture process can be found in @xcite .",
    "the tidal capture cross section can be computed from the requirement that the deposition of kinetic energy during the encounter , @xmath57 , is larger than the relative energy of the pair at infinity : @xmath58 . here",
    "@xmath59 is the reduced mass of the pair of stars with masses @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the tidal cross section to the exchange interaction one .",
    "as the gravitational focusing dominates in both cases , the cross section ratio is given by the formula ( hills 1992 ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath49 are , respectively , the radius of the star and the semimajor axis of the pre - encounter binary . in our calculations , however , we use a more precise formula for the tidal capture cross section from @xcite , rather than the simple scaling given above .",
    "these authors present a convenient fitting formula for the cross section of tidal capture for two stars with a large mass ratio as a function of their relative velocity at infinity .",
    "@xcite estimated the tidal capture rate of massive imbhs ( population iii remnants ) at the galactic center .",
    "they noted that , although the capture rate in dense stellar regions is high enough , because of the high velocity dispersion the close encounters leading to the tidal disruption of the main - sequence star will be very common , leading to a consistent decrease in the estimate of surviving binary systems which can appear as ulxs .",

    "_ in this case , for each imbh and for each galactic plane crossing , we randomly selected @xmath64 binary systems whose evolution is calculated according to standard initial distributions ( see below ) . since each imbh crosses the galactic plane @xmath65 times during @xmath15  yrs , the total number of potential encounters with binaries is @xmath66 .",
    "statistically significant results are obtained for @xmath67 , so in our calculations we selected several tens of binaries per each imbh .",

    "we use equprobable distribution in the logarithmic scale .",

    "the lower limit is determined by the condition of coalescence of the components at the main sequence .",
    "the choice of the upper limit is dictated by the following considerations .",
    "first , wide binaries ( with semimajor axes up to @xmath73 ) are soft and will be disrupted by dynamical interactions with an imbh , so it is not necessary to compute their evolution in detail .",
    "hence we used the upper limit @xmath74 for initial binary semi - major axis .",
    "this value is also close to the boundary beyond which binaries will be destroyed by dynamical interactions in stellar systems with velocity dispersion of around 100 km / s , which is typical for central regions of galaxies . the account in the statistics for wide binaries with @xmath75 , which can be present in galactic disks , is easily made as we use flat probability distribution in the logarithmic scale . for correction",
    "we just need to divide the calculated rates by a numerical coefficient of the order of two as we took binaries from one half ( from @xmath76 up to @xmath77 ) of the full range ( from @xmath78 up to @xmath79 ) .",

    "this value is favored by some population synthesis analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "this simplification is justified by the fact that , for the close binaries of interest , tidal circularization occurs on time scales much shorter than other characteristic evolutionary times .",
    "the number density of stars in the galactic disc is assumed to be one per cubic parsec .",
    "this value is an order of magnitude higher than that in the solar vicinity , but it should be typical for central regions of galaxies , in which we are interested @xcite .",
    "our results on the bright source statistics can , however , be easily generalized to other values of the stellar density since they scale linearly with it .",
    "the disc ( for the case of wandering imbhs ) is modeled as a flat structure with semithickness of 300 pc .",
    "since most crossings happen at small galactocentric radius , such a thick disc is a reasonable approximation .",
    "we assume that all stars belong to binaries .",
    "as the fraction of massive stars in binary systems is not less than 50% , this appears to be a safe assumption .",
    "the evolution of a binary system is considered as a sequence of stages , and the duration of each one is defined by the shortest evolutionary timescale of one of the binary components .",
    "the states of stars and binary parameters at the beginning of a stage uniquely determine the fate of the binary up to the end of the stage .    at each evolutionary stage @xmath85 of the binary @xmath86 ( @xmath87 for halo imbhs and @xmath88 for imbhs originated from low - metallicity stars ) , we calculate the probability of the exchange interaction @xmath89 with an imbh during the bh galactic plane crossing time @xmath90 for the case of wandering imbhs : @xmath91 for imbhs inside the disc originated from zero - metallicity stars this probability reads : @xmath92 here @xmath93",

    "as it was shown in @xcite , the distribution of @xmath94 has the following property . for @xmath97 ( for which @xmath98 ) , there are almost no binaries in the semimajor axis range @xmath99 .",

    "after the binary parameters are determined , we calculate the evolutionary track of the system using the population synthesis code .",
    "calculations continue up to the age @xmath103  yrs . the statistics of accreting binary sources is collected for all halo imbhs and disc imbhs .      since we calculate the probability to capture a companion from a given ( randomly selected ) binary system , it is necessary to take into account two effects .",
    "the first regards the duration , @xmath104 , of the stage @xmath85 at which the system @xmath86 was taken .",
    "the second is due to the fact that the ulx stage ( @xmath105 ) is just a short episode in the life of the formed system .",
    "we assume that an accretion rate @xmath106 yields a bolometric luminosity @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a typical value of the accretion efficiency @xcite . in figs .  2 - 3 and 5 - 6",

    "yr@xmath1 , which corresponds to a bolometric luminosity of @xmath110 erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "this is the value we will be referring to when computing the statistics of ulxs .",
    "since the processes we study here yield very small probabilities for the observation of bright sources , we limit our results to the bolometric luminosities , keeping in mind that these in turn provide an upper limit to the x - ray luminosities .",

    "accounting for low - luminosity sources increases the number of accreting imbhs ( but not ulxs ) to @xmath138 per galaxy ( see figs .",
    "[ halo35 ] , [ halo30 ] ) .    as in the case of exchange interactions",
    ", we also performed calculations where , instead of the very short kelvin - helmholtz timescale of the red giant envelope , we took the he - burning time in the stellar core .",
    "results are not changed significantly .",
    "for some ranges of @xmath139 , in our calculations we found only a few accreting systems . as we present here integral distributions , this results in the appearance of `` plateaus '' .",
    "this is clearly seen in the figures : the lines for tidal capture often demonstrate a `` step - like '' shape .    for tidal captures ,",
    "we find three main types of accreting components to imbhs .",
    "two of them are the same as in the case of exchange interactions ( red giants and white dwarfs ) .",
    "for low accretion rates @xmath140  yr  @xmath1 , companions are mainly white dwarfs . for high accretion rates , @xmath141  yr  @xmath1 , most companions are red giants . for the intermediate range @xmath142  yr  @xmath1 the accreting components can be dwarf main sequence stars . in these systems",
    "accretion occurs because of orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission .",
    "this mechanism of binary orbital angular momentum removal is effective for very close binaries which can be formed after tidal captures .",
    "the mass accretion rate in this case is determined by the orbital decay timescale .",
    "imbhs formed in the disc have much lower velocity dispersion ( @xmath143 km s@xmath1 ) than halo imbhs , so binaries formed in the galaxy plane due to tidal captures by them will have larger semimajor axes than those formed from captures by high - velocity halo imbhs .",
    "this results in less effective ulx formation , see figs .",
    "[ disk235 ] .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated that the probability to form an ulx by imbhs wandering in the galactic halo through capturing of a stellar companion is very low .",
    "there are three reasons for that ( see eq .",
    "[ threeprobs ] ) .",
    "first , the very probability of capturing a stellar companion by imbhs in the galactic disc is extremely small . for halo imbhs",
    "it is mainly due to their high velocities during the galactic disc crossings .",
    "captures are more probable in the central regions of galaxies with higher stellar density , but still their numbers are insufficient to explain the observed ulx statistics in galaxies .",
    "another reason is that the bright accretion stage is usually very short ( see also ) .",
    "the third reason is that to form an ulx , it is usually necessary to capture a component at a particular stage of its evolution , when the orbital separation is small , such as , for example , a very close binary with a white dwarf , or a system just before coalescence . for",
    "disc imbhs evolved from zero - metallicity stars the same three arguments are valid .",
    "taken together , the three processes listed above , ( 1 ) capturing of any component , ( 2 ) short duration of the ulx stage , and ( 3 ) small probability to find a star which is going to be captured on a specific evolutionary stage , reduce the number of observable ulxs by @xmath144 orders of magnitude .",
    "we have quantified the relative importance of the three processes and found that it is the short lifetime of an ulx that mostly reduces the rate of occurrence of ulxs ( by four orders of magnitude alone ) .",
    "the necessity to capture a stellar component at the particular evolutionary stage reduces the ulx occurrence rate by three orders of magnitude .",
    "the dynamical capture probability causes another two orders of magnitude reduction .",
    "suppose that in every passage through the galactic plane an imbh always captures a star through exchange interactions with binaries .",
    "not all of the binaries formed this way can later appear as ulxs .",
    "let us forget about this for a moment and assume that the initial binary system always provides the imbh with a stellar companion with appropriate properties .",
    "then let us assume that once an ulx is formed , it is visible for a very long time . only under such overly optimistic assumptions",
    "the number of imbhs formed in 3@xmath20 halos ( @xmath145 per galaxy ) would be sufficient to produce the observed @xmath250.1 ulx per galaxy .",
    "we conclude that the mechanisms of exchange interaction and of tidal capture can not explain the observed population of ulxs under the assumption that they are related to imbhs wandering in the galactic halos or formed _ in situ _ from zero - metallicity stars in galactic discs .",
    "we have showed that the formation rate of accreting systems with imbhs is very low even for smaller luminosities . for @xmath146",
    "erg  s@xmath1 we obtain only @xmath147 accreting imbh per galaxy .",
    "hence we conclude that dynamical captures of companions by imbhs remnants of zero metallicity stars do not lead to a potentially interesting number of observable sources .",
    "a much more promising way of forming ulxs from imbhs can be achieved in a scenario in which the formation of imbhs derives from runaway merging of stars in dense star clusters . in this case",
    "the probability of capturing a companion is very large .",
    "the formation of persistent ulxs is however not granted .",
    "find that imbh binaries reach a steady ulx luminosity only for a short period of time ( @xmath148  years ) , making their detection improbable .",
    "@xcite , @xcite find more optimistic results for more massive imbhs , when companion stars are captured through tidal heating from a mass - segregated population .",
    "another possibility , which would bypass the need for a stellar companion , is that the fuel for the imbhs is provided by a baryonic remnants that they carry with themselves ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these imbhs , however , are not to be confused with `` naked '' imbhs ejected from galaxy centers by , e.g. , the gravitational rocket mechanism .",
    "imbhs accreting from baryonic remnants are instead associated with inefficient galaxy mergers , where the imbhs was hosted by a small satellite falling into the halo of a large galaxy .",
    "such light satellites seem to be almost unaffected by orbital decay , and they are left on peripheral orbits .",
    "the imbhs hosted in the satellite cores , if accreting , would be found in the outskirts of a galaxy .",
    "@xcite , however , notices that the most ( or even all ) , of ulxs are found located within the optical extent of their host galaxies .",
