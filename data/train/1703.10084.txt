    "the progress in the design of nano - scale machines over the past decade has motivated researchers to study the concept of nano - communications . inspired by biological systems , diffusion - based molecular communication ( mc ) systems",
    "have been proposed as a potential solution for communication in nano - networks where molecules are used as information carriers @xcite .",
    "nano - networks are envisioned to facilitate revolutionary applications in areas such as biological engineering , healthcare , and environmental monitoring  @xcite .      in recent years , there has been a significant amount of work on various aspects of mc systems , including transmitter and receiver design @xcite , multiple access protocols @xcite , and network layer issues @xcite . however , the problem of _ abnormality detection _ , which is one of the key challenges in many of the applications envisioned for nano - networks such as environmental and health monitoring and disease diagnosis , has not been fully investigated yet . for example , to enable smart drug delivery , first an abnormality has to be detected and its progress has to be monitored @xcite .",
    "then , depending on the condition of the target site , a drug can be released at an appropriate rate .",
    "this motivates the investigation of abnormality detection at micro - scale using mcs .",
    "abnormality detection has been extensively studied in different fields , see e.g. @xcite . in this context , abnormalities are also referred to as anomalies , outliers , exceptions , aberrations , surprises , and peculiarities in various areas of application including failure detection in computer science @xcite , fraud detection for credit cards @xcite , and the segmentation of signals in biomedical applications @xcite . in most applications ,",
    "abnormality detection is crucial and requires a high degree of accuracy . a widely - adopted strategy to increase the detection accuracy is through cooperative sensing where several distributed sensors send their sensing results to a common fusion center ( fc ) which makes the final decision @xcite .",
    "abnormality detection via mc introduces certain new challenges which are not encountered in other fields .",
    "in particular , for collaborative abnormality detection in mc applications , the communication between the sensors and the fc is challenging due the inherent randomness of the mc channel .",
    "very few prior works have considered this problem . recently in @xcite , a cooperative mc system has been considered , where one transmitter and several receivers send their local _",
    "hard decisions _ about a transmitted bit to an fc which makes the final decision .",
    "however , @xcite does not consider the abnormality detection problem in particular .",
    "in another recent work @xcite , the abnormality detection problem in mc sensor networks is studied and the _ sub - optimal or _ fusion rule is employed to combine the observations received at the fc based on _ hard decisions _ made at the sensors . in @xcite , it is assumed that all sensors employ the same type of molecules and the reporting channels , i.e. , the sensor - fc channels , are modeled as _ additive white gaussian noise _ ( awgn ) channels . in the next subsection",
    ", we discuss in detail how this paper expands @xcite in several important directions , e.g. , by allowing soft decisions at the sensors , making more realistic assumptions regarding the mc channel , deriving optimal detectors , and developing low - complexity sub - optimal detectors .",
    "we consider collaborative abnormality detection where multiple sensors sense a surface , e.g. an area of tissue , and send their _ soft _ noisy sensing values to an fc via diffusion - based mc .",
    "we consider two different transmission schemes where the sensors employ different types of molecules ( dtm ) and the same type of molecule ( stm ) , respectively .",
    "the considered dtm and stm schemes provide a trade - off between complexity and performance .",
    "moreover , we model the diffusion channel as a poisson channel with an arbitrary memory length , i.e. , inter - symbol interference ( isi ) is present and we assume that the environmental background noise is also poisson distributed as in @xcite . we note that the poisson model is more realistic for mc systems with molecule counting receivers than the awgn model assumed in @xcite , see @xcite .    for the considered mc system , we first derive optimal fusion rules for both dtm and stm .",
    "we note that the optimal detectors entail high computational complexity as log - likelihood ratios ( llrs ) have to be computed . to overcome this issue",
    ", we show that for stm , the optimal decision rule can be transformed into an equivalent low - complexity decision rule . since a similar transformation is not possible for dtm",
    ", we propose several simple low - complexity sub - optimal detectors based on different approximations of the llr .",
    "the proposed low - complexity detectors are more suitable for practical mc systems than the complex optimal decision rule , particularly when the fc is a nano - machine with limited computational capabilities .",
    "furthermore , we propose an analytical approach for numerical evaluation of the performance of the proposed optimal and sub - optimal detectors in terms of their false alarm and missed detection probabilities . in addition , the performance of some of the detectors is analyzed in closed form .",
    "we further provide asymptotic performance bounds for the presented detectors and derive approximate error exponents for a large number of sensors .",
    "these bounds allow us to compare the asymptotic performance of different detectors .",
    "simulation results verify our analytical derivations and provide interesting insights regarding the trade - off between complexity and performance for the proposed optimal and sub - optimal detectors and for the considered dtm and stm schemes .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the system model , the sensing model , and the reporting channel model . in sections iii",
    ", we derive optimal detectors for both the dtm and stm reporting schemes , whereas , in section iv , several sub - optimal low - complexity detectors for dtm are proposed .",
    "the performance analysis and asymptotic performance bounds for the proposed schemes are presented in section v. finally , section vi provides extensive numerical performance results and comparisons , and section vii concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a hypothesis testing problem for a system consisting of @xmath0 identical sensors , each monitoring a part of a target , e.g. , an area of tissue , and an fc , see fig .",
    "[ fig.general_sn_model ] .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the normal and abnormal hypotheses , respectively .",
    "the goal is to decide at the fc whether the normal or the abnormal hypothesis is true based on the observations received from the sensors .",
    "we describe the sensing model , the reporting channel model , and the fc in sections [ ia ] , [ ib ] , and [ ic ] , respectively .",
    "we adopt a general and abstract model for the sensing process .",
    "in particular , let @xmath3 $ ] be a random variable ( rv ) which models the sensed value at the @xmath4-th sensor and let @xmath5 be a realization of rv @xmath6 .",
    "hereby , small and large values of @xmath5 are used to indicate that the sensing observation at sensor @xmath4 leans towards hypotheses @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "in fact , for ideal ( noise - free ) sensors , we have @xmath7 and @xmath8 for hypotheses",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ; however , for non - ideal ( noisy ) sensors , we have in general @xmath9 $ ] for both hypotheses .",
    "due to practical considerations , we assume @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the set of @xmath12 possible sensed values at the sensors . given each hypothesis , rvs @xmath13 ,",
    "are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) , i.e. , the sensors are assumed to be spatially uncorrelated . in particular",
    ", we mathematically model @xmath6 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of @xmath17 , under hypotheses @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . for ideal sensors",
    ", we have @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the dirac delta function .",
    "however , for practical sensors , we expect that the pdfs @xmath21 and @xmath22 are decreasing and increasing functions of @xmath5 , respectively . as a special case , for @xmath23 , which corresponds to a hard decision at the sensor , the probabilities of false alarm and missed detection at each sensor are denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . that is @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "we consider a time - slotted transmission with time slots of duration @xmath30 , and a reporting period of @xmath31 $ ] where @xmath32 is the number of time slots .",

    "we consider two different reporting schemes depending on the type of molecule released by the sensors , namely dtm and stm , see fig .",

    "represent the type of molecule and the sensor which releases the molecule , respectively .",
    "the environmental noise molecules are represented by black circles . ]",
    "the molecules released by the sensors propagate through the channel and are observed at the fc .",
    "we assume that a molecule is absorbed at the fc when it hits the surface of the fc .",
    "for simplicity of analysis , we assume that the channels between the sensors and the fc are statistically identical , i.e. , the distances between all sensors and the fc are identical . in particular ,",
    "let @xmath35 denote the hitting probability , i.e. , the probability that the molecule released in the current time slot hits the receiver during the @xmath36-th next time slot . the hitting probability @xmath35 depends on the communication medium @xcite . for instance , for a general three - dimensional environment with a point - source transmitter located at the origin and having a distance of @xmath37 from the center of a spherical receiver with radius @xmath38 , the hitting probability is given by @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the diffusion coefficient of the transmitted molecule and @xmath41 is the complementary error function . for general mc channels , the hitting probabilities @xmath42 ,",
    "can be estimated using training sequence - based channel estimators @xcite .",
    "let @xmath43 be a rv which models the number of molecules of the type that the @xmath4-th sensor employs observed at the fc in the @xmath44-th time slot and let @xmath45 be a realization of rv @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , constitute the received signals at the fc for dtm .",
    "in contrast , for stm , the fc is not able to distinguish between the molecules released by different sensors as all sensors employ the same type of molecule . in this case , the total number of molecules absorbed at the fc in the @xmath44-th time slot is modelled by rv @xmath47 .",
    "hereby , we denote a particular realization of rv @xmath48 by @xmath49 which constitutes the received signal at the fc . assuming synchronous transmission @xcite , the input - output relationships of the channels between the sensors and the fc are modeled as independent poisson channels with additive poisson noise @xcite , i.e. , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the expected numbers of environmental noise molecules observed at the fc in each time slot .",
    "we assume that the expected number of noise molecules is identical for all types of signaling molecules employed , i.e. , @xmath53 , holds . from ( [ eq : yn ] ) , we observe that both @xmath43 and @xmath48 comprise three independent terms : _",
    "@xmath52 , the noise term , _ ii ) _",
    "@xmath54 , the expected number of received molecules due to the current transmission , and _",
    "@xmath55 , the expected number of received molecules due to previous transmissions .",
    "the term @xmath56 increases with increasing @xmath44 and saturates to constant @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "the speed of convergence depends on the environment , i.e. , the values of the @xmath42 .",
    "if the channel has a finite memory of @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 , the transient effect vanishes after @xmath61 time slots , and then , the expected number of molecules received in each time slot will be constant , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "the transient period during @xmath63 , adds a non - uniformity to the hypothesis testing problem .",
    "however , for a channel memory @xmath59 much less than the reporting period of @xmath64 , the transient period can be neglected .",
    "in fact , there are several options for mitigating the effect of the transient period : _",
    "i ) _ choosing @xmath65 so that we can neglect the first @xmath61 time slots without compromising the performance , _ ii ) _ choosing @xmath30 sufficiently large such that @xmath66 , and _",
    "iii ) _ employing enzymes @xcite to speed up the decaying of the channel impulse response ( cir ) as a function of time , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) for further justification . using either of these approaches , the _ expected _ number of molecules received at the fc from a given sensor will be constant in each time slot .",
    "thus , assuming that observations at the fc in different time slots are identically distributed , for dtm , the probability distribution of @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes probability .",
    "( [ eq : indsamp ] ) also holds for stm after removing superscript @xmath70 .",
    "the fc is assumed to be a node with sufficient processing capability that is able to make decisions based on the molecules received from the sensors . a promising approach for implementing such a node is using engineered bacteria @xcite where the bacteria can be designed to individually detect and count different types of molecules .",
    "such engineered bacteria may also be able to perform simple processing tasks . to perform more sophisticated processing ,",
    "one approach is to employ a synthetic / electronic nano - machine with sufficient processing capability to aid the engineered bacteria .",
    "alternatively , for applications where a nano - machine only collects observations and forwards them to an external processing unit which serves as the fc outside the mc environment , high computational complexity may be affordable .",
    "this case may apply e.g. in health monitoring when a computer outside the body may be available for offline processing  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we derive the optimum detection rules for both dtm and stm .",
    "let @xmath71 denote an rv vector modelling the observation vector which contains the numbers of received molecules during all time slots , i.e. , @xmath72 for dtm and @xmath73 for stm , and let @xmath74 be a realization of rv @xmath71 . to derive the optimum decision rule",
    ", we must compare the llr with a threshold denoted by @xmath75 @xcite .",

    "moreover , for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 is obtained as @xmath89 where equality @xmath90 follows from the fact that the observations in different time slots , i.e. , @xmath91 , are independent , and equality @xmath92 is obtained by substituting @xmath93 by the poisson distribution with mean @xmath94 .",
    "since the sensors are assumed to be independent , the total llr is the sum of the llrs of all sensors @xcite , i.e. , we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 for the special case of @xmath23 , i.e. , hard decisions at the sensors , the total llr can be simplified to @xmath97 using ( [ totllr ] ) , the optimal decision can be obtained from ( [ mmap_d4 ] ) .",

    "in fact , it is expected that @xmath105 and @xmath106 have the aforementioned properties for practical sensors .",
    "for instance , under hypothesis @xmath2 , a sensor with a reasonable performance would be expected to yield @xmath107 for @xmath108 .      in this subsection",
    ", we focus on sensors employing stm reporting , i.e. , all sensors employ the same type of molecule for signaling their observations to the fc .",
    "therefore , the fc can not distinguish between the molecules released by different sensors . in this case",

    "the possible values , @xmath111 , of @xmath112 , lie in the set @xmath113 , i.e. , @xmath114 .",

    "then , based on this property , we propose a low - complexity optimal detector .",
    "[ corolstm ] the llr for stm , @xmath79 , given in ( [ llr2 ] ) is a monotonically increasing function with respect to the sum of samples , @xmath125 , under the following condition @xmath126    the proof is similar to that for theorem  [ th2 ] .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid repetition , we omit the detailed proof here .    based on corollary  [ corolstm ] , @xmath79 is strictly increasing in terms of @xmath127 .",
    "let us denote this mapping by @xmath128 and its inverse by @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , comparing @xmath79 with threshold @xmath75 , cf .",
    "( [ mmap_d4 ] ) , is equivalent to comparing @xmath127 with a new threshold @xmath130 .",
    "this leads to the following equivalent optimal detector @xmath131 we note that the above detector is much simpler than that in ( [ mmap_d4 ] ) since the computation of the llr in ( [ llr2 ] ) is avoided .",
    "for stm , we could show that optimal detection can be performed without evaluation of the corresponding llr in ( [ llr2 ] ) , which led to the simple optimal detector in ( [ optstmsimple ] ) .",
    "however , for dtm , such a simplification does not seem possible and computing the llr given in ( [ totllr ] ) may be computationally too complex for simple nano - machines due to the exponential functions in the numerator and the denominator in ( [ llr_loc ] ) , which have large dynamic ranges . to illustrate this problem more clearly , we rewrite the optimum @xmath98 for each sensor @xmath4 as a function of @xmath132 as @xmath133 where @xmath134 . although the values of @xmath135 in ( [ newapp ] ) may have a reasonable range , the term @xmath136 inside the logarithm can assume very large values if the number of received molecules @xmath132 is large .",
    "in fact , for computation of the optimal llr , _ we have to first compute all summands _ in the numerator and denominator , respectively , then compute the summation for both the numerator and denominator , and _ then apply the logarithm _ to the ratio of the numerator and denominator .",
    "because of the summations in the numerator and denominator in ( [ newapp ] ) , the logarithm does not cancel out the exponential functions .",
    "this leads to a large dynamic range , especially for large @xmath0 , @xmath32 , and @xmath137 .    in this section ,",
    "we derive several simple low - complexity sub - optimal detectors for dtm by using appropriate approximations for the llr .",
    "as will be shown in section  vi , these sub - optimum detectors provide a favorable trade - off between detection performance and complexity , and hence , are more suitable for implementation in nano - machines with limited computational capabilities .",
    "this approximation , first introduced in @xcite for classical wireless sensor networks , takes into account only the maximum terms in both the numerator and denominator of @xmath138 in ( [ newapp ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath139 since the @xmath140 function is monotonically increasing , we have @xmath141 . applying this rule to ( [ max - log ] ) , we obtain @xmath142@xmath143 as can be seen from ( [ max - log_simple ] ) , unlike the optimal @xmath144 in ( [ newapp ] ) , the expression for the sub - optimal @xmath145 is a linear function of @xmath132 which facilitates its numerical evaluation . the sub - optimal detector for the max - log approximation is obtained from ( [ mmap_d4 ] ) by substituting @xmath146 for @xmath147 in ( [ totllr ] ) .      for the mrc approximation @xcite , all sensors are assumed to be ideal , i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . by substituting the ideal sensing distributions into ( [ newapp ] ) , we obtain @xmath148 the sub - optimal @xmath149 is in fact a linear function in @xmath132 which again facilitates its numerical evaluation .",
    "in addition , applying the mrc approximation given in ( [ mrc ] ) in ( [ mmap_d4 ] ) , the detector essentially compares the summation of all molecules received from all sensors in all time slots with a suitable threshold , denoted by @xmath150 .",
    "this leads to the following simple detector @xmath151 the mrc detector is expected to perform well when the sensors are reliable but the reporting channel is unreliable .      for the cv approximation , which was first introduced in @xcite for classical sensor networks , instead of substituting the numerator and denominator of the llr in ( [ newapp ] ) with their corresponding maximum terms as in the max - log decision rule",

    "then , in the second stage , the global final decision is made using the @xmath0 individual decisions .",
    "our motivation for considering this sub - optimum detector is that it is simple and it may be more practical when the adopted fc is a biological entity . in particular , for some biological cells , the processing unit of a cell does not have direct access to the counted molecules .",
    "rather , a preliminary decision may be made by the signaling pathway which connects the receptors to the processing unit of the cell @xcite .",
    "for each sensor @xmath4 , the detector makes a local decision by comparing @xmath98 , given in ( [ llr_loc ] ) , with threshold level @xmath155 , that is @xmath156 using theorem  [ th2 ] , the optimum local decision rule in ( [ mmap_d111 ] ) can be further simplified for ease of implementation .",

    "that is , @xmath98 is a monotonic function in @xmath157 .",
    "this property implies that , comparing @xmath157 with an appropriate new threshold , denoted by @xmath158 , is equivalent to comparing the llr , @xmath98 , with the original threshold , @xmath155 .",

    "[ fig : analysis ] , the optimal detector for dtm outperforms the optimal detector for stm especially for small false alarm probabilities , i.e. , for @xmath253 .",

    "furthermore , for the adopted set of system parameters , the cv detector has a superior performance compared to the mrc detector for small false alarm probabilities , i.e. , for @xmath254 .",
    "in addition , for false alarm probabilities @xmath255 , the simple two - stage detector suffers from a considerable performance loss compared to the other detectors ; however , as the false alarm probability increases , this performance loss decreases too .",
    "next , we compare the performance of the optimal detectors for dtm and stm in more detail . in particular , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dscomp ] , the probability of missed detection for dtm and stm is plotted versus @xmath137 for different values of @xmath52 and a given false alarm probability of @xmath256 .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : dscomp ] that as the value of @xmath137 increases , the probability of missed detection decreases since the mc reporting channel becomes more reliable .",
    "moreover , we observe that the relative performance of stm and dtm depends on the value @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , for small @xmath52 , dtm outperforms stm whereas for large @xmath52 , stm may significantly outperform dtm .",
    "in fact , the advantage of dtm over stm is that that the fc can distinguish between the molecules released by different sensors and exploit this additional knowledge for the improvement of the detection performance . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage of stm over dtm comes from the fact that the mean number of noise molecules for _ each type of molecule _ is constant which leads to a higher overall noise for dtm compared to stm , especially when the number of sensors is large .",

    "as can be observed , the performance of the mrc detector improves relative to that of the cv and two - stage detectors as @xmath24 and @xmath25 decrease .",
    "this is due to the fact that we assumed ideal sensing to derive the mrc detector , cf .",

    "in contrast , by increasing @xmath0 , the number of independent sensing observations increases , similar to effect that increasing the diversity gain has in conventional wireless communications .",
    "the latter effect is generally more substantial compared to the former as far as the overall detection performance is concerned .        in the following ,",

    "we first derived the optimal decision rules for both dtm and stm . for stm , we showed that the optimal detector has a simple equivalent form which is easier to implement .",

    "for example , although stm is generally simpler than dtm , it outperforms dtm when a large number of noise molecules are present in the environment .",
    "moreover , for the proposed sub - optimal dtm detectors , the max - log detector offers the best performance , and the relative performance of the mrc , cv , and two - stage detectors crucially depends on the choice of system parameters .",

    "albeit being a discrete function , our proof assumes that @xmath186 is continuous ; however , if a function is monotonic with respect to a continuous argument , the monotonicity also applies to discrete arguments .",
