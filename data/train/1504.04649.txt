    "graphene , which consists of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a @xmath0 honey - comb structure , @xcite has been subject of a great number of studies , owing to its unique properties that were experimentally observed and theoretically predicted . these include , but not limited to , electric field @xcite and quantum hall effects , @xcite ultra - high carrier mobility , @xcite superior thermal conductivity , @xcite high mechanical strength , @xcite electron - hole puddles , @xcite and sensitivity to adsorbents .",
    "@xcite although , there is a large effort focusing on controlling and adapting graphene for future use in real devices , @xcite some rather fundamental aspects still remain incompletely understood . among others , is the interaction between graphene sheets and individual water molecules on top of them .",
    "@xcite this interaction can cause a doping effect on graphene and change the density of states near the fermi level , which therefore is a rather promising effect for potential applications .",
    "@xcite however , weak dispersion interactions play an important role in the binding between carbon atoms and water molecules .",
    "hence , there seems to be a controversy in the reported results , in particular whether or not graphene is transparent with respect to van der waals ( vdw ) interactions between the substrate beneath graphene and the water droplet on top of it .",
    "@xcite therefore , an accurate treatment of vdw interactions between water and graphene is required .",
    "the difficulty of conventional local or semi - local density functional theory ( dft ) to quantitatively describe these interactions originates from the long - range nature of dispersion forces .",
    "@xcite even though a large number of different empirical and _ first - principles _ techniques have been suggested to calculate vdw interactions within dft calculations , @xcite there is still great demand for an accurate and , at the same time , computationally very efficient _ first - principles _ technique to account for vdw forces in large systems .    here",
    ", we extend the recently introduced method of silvestrelli @xcite which combines quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) model with maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf ) , @xcite to periodic systems . using this approach",
    ", we investigate the vdw interactions between an extended layer of water and graphene with respect to the number of layers .",
    "the question on the additivity of vdw interactions between the water and graphene layers is discussed in detail .",
    "this remaining of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical method is outlined in section ii , while the computational details are specified in section iii .",
    "the eventual results are shown and discussed in section iv .",
    "considering mlwfs as charge distributions in real - space , it is directly possible to compute the corresponding dipole moments .",
    "@xcite based on this information , the dynamical electron - correlation effects that arise from many - body instantaneous long - range interactions of the oscillating dipoles can be quantified by the qho model @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of mlwfs , while @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the masses and @xmath5 the displacements of the oscillators from equilibrium .",
    "the frequency and polarizability of the oscillators are denoted as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while @xmath8 is the dipole - dipole interaction tensor . knowing the centers and spreads @xmath9 of the mlwfs , the respective polarizabilities @xmath10 and characteristic frequencies @xmath11 can be calculated , where @xmath12 is a proportionality constant and @xmath13 the atomic number .",
    "@xcite moreover , @xmath8 is modified to allow for orbital overlap at short distances , by introducing a short - range damping function for the bare coulomb potential .",
    "@xcite the energies of all @xmath2 3-dimensional qhos can be found by diagonalizing a @xmath14 matrix @xmath15 that is defined as    @xmath16    which contains @xmath17 @xmath18 matrix - blocks corresponding to the individual mlwfs .",
    "the vdw correction can then be obtained by @xmath19 where @xmath20 are eigenvalues of the correlated system , while @xmath6 are the aforementioned characteristic frequencies of the dipole moments attributed to the mlwfs .    due to the fact that @xmath8 decays relatively quickly with respect to the distance between the mlwfs , instead of a genuine ewald sum ,",
    "the interactions between the mlwfs in the unit cell and those in its periodic images are taken into account by considering a finite buffer region around the unit cell , where the mlwfs of the original unit cell are replicated in all spatial directions .",
    "to that extend we decompose the vdw interaction energy for the extended system @xmath21 into a sum of vdw interaction energies of the mlwfs in the unit cell @xmath22 , the interaction energy between the mlwfs in the unit cell and those in the buffer zone @xmath23 , and interaction energy between the mlwfs in the buffer region only , which is denoted as @xmath24 .",
    "the vdw interaction energy of the extended system then reads as @xmath25 from which the last term has to be subtracted to yield the desired vdw interaction energy of the original system , i.e. @xmath26 as a consequence , the total energy including the vdw correction is @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the total dft energy .",
    "in the following we have considered two systems , a single layer of graphene ( slg ) , as well as bilayer graphene ( blg ) , both with a 100 molecule water slab on top .",
    "the graphene , which consisted of 128 carbon atoms per layer , was placed in a periodic orthorhombic simulation box parallel to the @xmath29-plane with a large 35  @xmath30 vacuum portion along the perpendicular @xmath31-direction .",
    "the mlwf centers of the eventual system are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]     vertical separation.,height=188 ]    in order to obtain the atomic configuration of the water molecules , the _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) simulation were performed in the canonical ensemble at 300  k using the second - generation car - parrinello method of khne et al .",
    "@xcite as implemented in the gaussian and plane wave @xcite dft code cp2k / quickstep .",
    "@xcite in aimd simulation carbon atoms of graphene where fixed .",
    "the interatomic interactions were described by dft @xcite employing the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional @xcite , goedecker - teter - hutter pseudopotentials @xcite and a double-@xmath32 gaussian basis set with one addition al set of polarization functions .",
    "@xcite the spread of the wannier orbitals was minimized using the scheme of berghold et al .",
    "@xcite        to estimate the size of the buffer zone in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the vdw energy as defined in eq .",
    "[ totener ] is shown as a function of additional buffer width , @xmath33 .",
    "we found that d=12  @xmath30 is sufficient to adequately converge the vdw and to capture most of the relevant dispersion interactions , while at the same time keeping the size of the @xmath15 matrix manageable .",
    "to demonstrate the impact of periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , fig  [ fig3](a ) displays the vdw energy as a function of the distance between the water slab and slg , which is defined as the vertical gap between the nearest h atom of the water slab and the @xmath29-plane .          in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the interaction energy @xmath36 as obtained from bare pbe , pbe - d3 , pbe+@xmath22 and pbe+@xmath34 are shown as a function of the vertical distance between the water slab and slg .",
    "it is apparent that without any vdw correction pbe hardly binds , with the associated equilibrium distance being about 3.0  @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding equilibrium distance for both , pbe - d3 and pbe+@xmath34 are 2.5  @xmath30 and 2.6  @xmath30 for pbe+@xmath22 , which is in good agreement with previous results obtained by others using a large variety of different methods such as polarizable and non - polarizable force fields , dft calculations including dispersion corrections , calculations based on the random phase approximation , but also with local mp2 and ccsd(t ) calculations of a single water molecule on a hydrogen - terminated graphene flake .",
    "@xcite however , at variance to the latter , here a disordered water slab is considered , which comprises a large number of different water orientations towards the graphene layer .",
    "nevertheless , for most of the water molecules , one o - h bond is preferably pointing towards the hydrophobic surface , as has been observed in previous aimd simulations .",
    "@xcite the eventual interaction energy averaged over all water molecules is approximately @xmath37 per water molecule .",
    "the results for the interaction energy @xmath36 between the water slab and blg with ab stacking at the experimentally observed separation of 3.34  @xmath30 , @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and compared with the values for slg .",
    "due to the fact that considering blg including the buffer region would results in a rather large @xmath15 matrix that needs to be diagonalized , we have confined ourselves to vdw correction due to mlwfs in the unit cell .",
    "as before , employing the pbe functional without any vdw correction , water and blg barely binds .",
    "more interesting , we find that in comparison to the slg system , @xmath36 is reduced by about @xmath3530% .",
    "however , in the case of pbe - d3 calculation , the reduction of @xmath36 due to the second graphene layer is just @xmath355 % , while for @xmath22 the binding energies between slg and blg systems are essentially identical . nevertheless , in the latter case , the equilibrium distance changes from 2.6  @xmath30 for slg to 2.5  @xmath30 for blg .",
    "the pbe - d3 calculations predict an equilibrium distance of 2.5  @xmath30 for both of the considered systems , while for the bare pbe functional , the equilibrium distance reduces from 3.0  @xmath30 to 2.9  @xmath30 for slg and blg , respectively . in any case , for all the computational methods we have considered here , the binding energy between the water slab and slg is at least at large as for blg .",
    "this is to say , that the vdw interactions are non - additive and in fact are screened by the additional graphene layer , which immediately suggest that the electronic structure of an individual sheet is changed dramatically when interacting with other layers .",
    "to that extend we have calculated the @xmath31-component of the molecular dipole moment of both graphene systems without water using the berry phase operator for periodic systems and the centers of the mlwfs . @xcite in the case of the slg , the @xmath31-component of the dipole is unsurprisingly zero , while in the case of blg , each layer exhibits a dipole moment of @xmath353.65  d , though in opposite directions .",
    "we conclude by noting that the latter is a manifestation that the whole is more than the sum of its constituents , which highlights the importance to explicitly consider the electronic structure of the full interacting system to embrace the subtle many - body effects of the vdw interaction ."
