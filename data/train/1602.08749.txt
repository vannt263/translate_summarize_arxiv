    "cyclotron and synchrotron emission ( or _ magnetobremsstrahlung _ ) is produced by energetic electrons spiraling in a magnetic field in relativistic jets , in accretion flows onto black holes , in the interstellar medium , stellar coronae , planetary magnetospheres , and many other settings .",
    "our particular interest is in modeling synchrotron emission from potential event horizon telescope targets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including the galactic center source sgr a*. we are especially interested in modeling polarized emission , which may carry information about magnetic field structure in sgr a * that is unavailable in the total intensity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the problem of polarized transfer in a magnetized hot plasma is somewhat involved ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a covariant treatment ) . as input",
    "one must specify the electron distribution function @xmath1 and the magnetic field strength and direction .",
    "given these it is possible to calculate the emission and absorption coefficients using a suitable description of the radiation fields ( the stokes parameters are what we use here ) .",
    "in addition , for the full transfer problem , one must evaluate the faraday rotation and conversion coefficients .",
    "evaluations of the synchrotron emission and absorption coefficients date back to at least @xcite , who used an ultrarelativistic approximation ( although one issue that arises in the context of the galactic center is that the electrons are at most only mildly relativistic ) .",
    "the basic results are summarized in the important review paper of @xcite .",
    "more recent work is summarized in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "our goal is to extend the work of @xcite in three directions .",
    "first , one would like to be able to treat polarized radiation rather than just total intensity .",
    "second , leung et al . give a fitting formula only for a relativistic thermal distribution of electrons ; here we consider thermal , power - law , and the so - called kappa distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has a thermal core and power - law tails .",
    "third , the leung et al .",
    "code , harmony , is not as robust , easy to use , and modify as one might hope .",
    "here we extend the numerical scheme to make it more robust and use it to evaluate synchrotron emissivities and absorptivities for all stokes parameters .",
    "the scheme allows the computation to be performed for arbitrary gyrotropic distribution functions .",
    "we implement the scheme in a new code symphony , as well as include fits specialized to the above three distribution functions in the same code with a consistent interface .",
    "for example , to evaluate the emissivities directly for any distribution function , one uses the j_nu ( ) function , and to evaluate the fits to the emissivities for the above three distribution functions , one can call the j_nu_fit ( ) function . the numerical scheme and",
    "the interface in symphony makes it easy for one to incorporate new models , such as anisotropic distribution functions .    to accomplish the three extensions of leung et al .",
    "listed above , we begin in  [ sec : radtrans ] by setting notation , reviewing the polarized transfer equation , and writing the expressions that must be evaluated to find the emissivities and absorptivities . in ",
    "[ sec : df ] we review the model electron distribution functions ; in  [ sec : methods ] we summarize the necessary numerical procedure for evaluating what is essentially a two - dimensional integral and test our numerical procedure .",
    "the key results are in  [ sec : results ] , which compares emissivities and source functions from the three distribution functions , shows emitted polarization fractions , and provides fitting formulae . then  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes the results and gives a guide to the code .",
    "we are interested in incoherent but polarized radiation , which can be described in the stokes basis @xmath2 .",
    "recall that @xmath3 , also written @xmath4 ( @xmath5 frequency ) is the total intensity , @xmath6 and @xmath7 describe linear polarization , and @xmath8 measures circular polarization .    in what follows",
    "we use notation consistent with @xcite : @xmath9 is the frequency and @xmath10 is the wavevector of the emitted or absorbed photon , which lies at an angle @xmath11 to the magnetic field vector  @xmath12 ( unless otherwise stated @xmath13 is measured in gauss ) ; @xmath14 is the electron momentum and @xmath15 is the electron velocity , which lie at pitch angle @xmath16 to @xmath12 ; here @xmath17 lorentz factor and @xmath18 .",
    "finally , @xmath19 electron cyclotron frequency .",
    "we orient coordinates in the plasma frame so that @xmath20 for polarization vectors in the @xmath21-@xmath12 plane and as usual @xmath22 for polarization perpendicular to that plane . since synchrotron emission is linearly polarized perpendicular to the wavevector - magnetic field plane , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , by symmetry .",
    "consistent with ieee and iau conventions , @xmath25 if the electric field vector rotates in a right - handed sense around the wavevector .",
    "we assume that the distribution function is _ gyrotropic _ , i.e. independent of gyrophase , consistent with the idea that , in many applications , the electron larmor radius @xmath26 is small compared to the size of the system and small compared to characteristic scales in the flow . in writing the emissivities and absorptivities below we also assume that @xmath27 and that @xmath28 ; here @xmath29 is the plasma frequency .    in the stokes basis",
    "the radiative transfer equation is @xmath30 where the vector @xmath31 contains the emission coefficients , which have units of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 volume , @xmath34 differential solid angle ) .",
    "the mueller matrix @xmath35 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the absorption coefficients and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are what we will call faraday mixing coefficients .",
    "approximate expressions for these coefficients are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper we calculate @xmath41 and @xmath42 for several distribution functions . as described ( but not originally ) by @xcite , the emissivity in the stokes basis is related to the distribution function by @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 here @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 here @xmath52 is a bessel function of the first kind , and @xmath53 is its derivative .",
    "the absorptivities in the stokes basis are @xmath54 where ( assuming a gyrotropic distribution function ) @xmath55 we have treated the electron classically so that in the absorptivity , for example , the change in electron momentum associated with absorption of a single photon is small compared to the width of the distribution .    calculating the emissivities and absorptivities thus amounts to carrying out the integration over momentum space and sum over harmonics @xmath56 in equations and .",
    "the synchrotron emissivity and absorptivity depends on the electron distribution function : @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the electron number density , and we use the electron momentum space coordinates @xmath59 ; as usual @xmath60 is the electron lorentz factor , @xmath16 is the pitch angle , and @xmath61 is the gyrophase .    the numerical scheme described below can calculate emissivities and absorptivities for an arbitrary electron distribution function that is independent of gyrophase .",
    "we investigate three commonly used isotropic dfs : a relativistic thermal ( maxwell - jttner ) distribution ; a power - law distribution ; and a kappa distribution .",
    "the _ thermal _ distribution function is : @xmath62 where @xmath61 is the gyrophase , @xmath63 is a modified bessel function of the second kind , and @xmath64 is the dimensionless temperature .",
    "the nonrelativistic limit ( @xmath65 ) is @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for @xmath65 .",
    "the thermal distribution is widely used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is unlikely , however , that the distribution function is able to thermalize in the collisionless conditions typical of many synchrotron - emitting plasmas , so it is useful to have a nonthermal model as well .",
    "a commonly used nonthermal model is the _ power - law _",
    "distribution function : @xmath69 and zero otherwise . here",
    "@xmath70 is the number density of nonthermal electrons , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and p are parameters of the distribution .",
    "the power - law distribution is well motivated in the sense that observations directly imply the existence of power - law tails in distant synchrotron - emitting plasmas , in the solar wind , and in numerical particle - in - cell experiments studying particle acceleration in reconnection and shocks . nevertheless if @xmath73 then most of the electrons are clustered near @xmath74 ; if @xmath75 then the distribution function has a central hole that makes it unstable ( to the bump - on - tail instability ; see @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore useful to have a compromise distribution available that is stable , has a thermal core , and asymptotes to a power - law at high energy .",
    "this motivates the _ kappa _ distribution function .",
    "the kappa distribution consists of a nonthermal , power - law tail at large @xmath60 that smoothly transitions to a flat , thermal - like core for small @xmath60 .",
    "it originated as a fit to observed solar wind data ( @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "one interesting property of the kappa distribution is that it corresponds to the maximum of a modified entropy functional , namely the tsallis non - extensive entropy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the functional form of the distribution can be obtained by extremizing this entropy functional , subject to thermodynamic constraints , such as density and an appropriate definition of temperature ( @xcite ) . while this method gives the functional form of the distribution",
    ", @xmath76 is still an input parameter . in the limit @xmath77 , the kappa distribution asymptotes to the thermal distribution .",
    "figure ( [ fig : kappavsthemalinsection3]a ) shows how the kappa distribution function connects the thermal and the power law distribution functions , and figure ( [ fig : kappavsthemalinsection3]b ) shows the @xmath77 limit of the kappa distribution along with a thermal distribution .     and width @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath76 distribution asymptotes to the thermal distribution , with @xmath79 , at low particle lorentz factor @xmath60 and the power law distribution , with @xmath80 at large @xmath60 , and smoothly connects the two.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the relativistic _ kappa _ distribution function ( @xcite ) is : @xmath81 where @xmath58 is the number density of electrons , and @xmath76 and @xmath82 are parameters .",

    ". limit @xmath85 and the high @xmath86 limit @xmath87 can be combined to yield @xmath88 which has maximum error for @xmath89 of @xmath90 at @xmath91 . ]    in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath92 , ( [ eq : rel_kappa ] ) asymptotes to : @xmath93 where @xmath67 , @xmath94 .",
    "the parameter @xmath82 is analogous to @xmath95 , and is a measure of dispersion in momentum space . in the limit @xmath77 , @xmath96 in ( [ eq : rel_kappa ] ) and",
    "hence the kappa distribution goes over to the thermal distribution , with @xmath97 ( normalization takes care of the extra factor of @xmath98 ) .",
    "typically , @xmath76 is of order unity , so @xmath99 is the nonrelativistic limit and @xmath100 is the ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "the general expressions for both the emissivities and the absorptivities for a gryotropic distribution function reduce to a set of integrals and a summation of the form : @xmath101 here @xmath3 is the integrand ( not the stokes parameter ! ) . the @xmath102 function can be eliminated by integrating over one of @xmath103 , or @xmath56 . as in @xcite we integrate over @xmath104 . setting @xmath105 implies the substitution @xmath106 the ranges of integration and summation are then restricted by the conditions that @xmath107 and @xmath108 . the final form of the integrand is @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "figure ( [ fig : integrandthermalabs ] ) shows a heat map of the integrand @xmath113 for the emissivity of a thermal distribution .",
    "the integrands are either reflection symmetric or antisymmetric about @xmath114deg .",
    "it is possible to show from equations - , , that @xmath115 is symmetric , @xmath116 is symmetric , and @xmath117 is antisymmetric .",
    "this implies that the sense of emitted circular polarization changes moving from more nearly parallel to more nearly antiparallel to the field , and that the absorption coefficient has the same symmetry .",
    "we shall now describe the scheme that computes .",
    "we implement the scheme in a new code , symphony .",
    "it differs from the harmony code of leung et al . in code organization (",
    "our code is vastly simplified ) , as well as in technical aspects of the integration .",
    "as in leung et al . , the summation is done directly for @xmath118 , and is approximated by an integral for @xmath119 .",
    "the @xmath60 integral is evaluated first , followed by the @xmath56 summation / integration .",
    "the integrals are evaluated using the gnu science library ( gsl ) quasi - adaptive gaussian quadrature routines qag and qagiu , with accuracy controlled by a relative error tolerance of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath56 integral is performed well by the method described by @xcite , but the @xmath60 integration method breaks down at large @xmath122 , where the integrand is sharply peaked enough that qag can miss the peak entirely and return @xmath123 .",
    "this problem is solved by adaptively narrowing the range of integration based on an estimate for the location and width of the peak in @xmath60-space .",
    "the location of the peak corresponds ( using @xmath105 , @xmath124 , and assuming that @xmath11 is not close to @xmath123 or @xmath125 ) to the line @xmath126 .",
    "this estimate is based on the physical notion that in the ultrarelativistic limit emission at observer angle @xmath11 originates from electrons in a narrow cone of pitch angles of width @xmath127 around @xmath128 .",
    "notice that the emissivity and absorptivity are in any case susceptible to accurate asymptotic approximation in this limit .",
    "the leung et al .",
    "method also fails for stokes v because the @xmath60 integrand looks similar to a period of the sine function , with one lobe slightly larger than the other ; qag has difficulty resolving this small difference in area .",
    "to avoid erroneous numerical cancellation in this integral , we integrate from the leftmost bound to the zero in the middle of the sinusoid - like curve , and then sum / integrate this piece over @xmath56 .",
    "we then follow the same procedure for the right side of the sinusoid - like curve , and then sum the two results to get the final emission or absorption coefficient .",
    "this is not difficult because the integrand goes through one and only one zero at @xmath129 , which corresponds to a zero at @xmath130 .",
    "when @xmath124 this corresponds to @xmath131 , and this has the simple physical interpretation that the sign of @xmath117 ( and hence @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) depends on the sense of rotation of the electron ( orbit described by @xmath16 ) around the wavevector ( direction described by @xmath11 ) .     in the @xmath56-@xmath60 plane for the synchrotron emissivity of a thermal distribution with @xmath134 , @xmath135deg , b = 30 g and @xmath136",

    "code to evaluate the fitting formulae is embedded in the full symphony code and can be called using j_nu_fit ( ) and alpha_nu_fit ( ) .",
    "our investigation has uncovered a few interesting points .",
    "first , the source function for a kappa distribution function is thermal ( @xmath207 ) at low frequency and nonthermal ( @xmath0 ) only at high frequency .",
    "second , all models produce nonnegligible circular polarization at @xmath208 for our standard distribution function parameters .",
    "third , our procedure permits a direct evaluation of the accuracy of classic asymptotic formulae for the power - law distribution function ; these formulae are good to better than a percent for @xmath209 for the @xmath152 distribution considered here .",
    "fourth , the linear polarization fraction for a thermal distribution function approaches 1 for @xmath171 , and a similar result should obtain above any exponential cutoff in the distribution function .",
    "our codes may be useful to those seeking to understand the polarization properties of synchrotron emitting plasmas .",
    "all results depend on observer angle @xmath11 ( angle between photon and the magnetic field ) but in some circumstances it may be useful to average over direction if the field is weak and tangled , or if the field has significant unresolved structure driven by larmor - scale instabilities .",

    "<S> synchrotron emission and absorption determine the observational appearance of many astronomical systems . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we describe a numerical scheme for calculating synchrotron emissivities and absorptivities in all four stokes parameters for arbitrary gyrotropic electron distribution functions , building on earlier work by leung , gammie , and noble . </S>",
    "<S> we use this technique to evaluate the emissivities and the absorptivities for a thermal ( maxwell - jttner ) , isotropic power - law , and isotropic kappa distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> the latter contains a power - law tail at high particle energies that smoothly merges with a thermal core at low energies , as is characteristic of observed particle spectra in collisionless plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> we provide fitting formulae and error bounds on the fitting formulae for use in codes that solve the radiative transfer equation . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical method and the fitting formulae are implemented in a compact c library called symphony . we find that : the kappa distribution has a source function that is indistinguishable from a thermal spectrum at low frequencies and transitions to the characteristic self - absorbed synchrotron spectrum , @xmath0 , at high frequency ; the linear polarization fraction for a thermal spectrum is near unity at high frequency ; and all distributions produce o(10% ) circular polarization at low frequency for lines of sight sufficiently close to the magnetic field vector . </S>"
