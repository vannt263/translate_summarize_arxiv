    "social networks undoubtedly play an important role in influencing which businesses consumers spend their money at .",
    "consumers consult various sites for reviews before making decisions , such as consumer reports , zagat review , and other review sites , before making a choice where to spend their money . since the advent of web 2.0and various social sites , forums , etc getting reviews and feedback has become much easier .",
    "it follows , with this recent technology , consumers face a new problem in the form of reliability and trustworthiness of reviews .",
    "there exists the real possibility that businesses could manipulate ratings and reviews ",
    "directly and/or indirectly  causing the information that consumers rely on for good advice , to be misleading .",
    "another aspect of this problem comes in the form of scholarly papers , and their ratings : either by citation counts and/or reviews .",
    "there also exists the pontial for abuse of this rating system among papers @xcite , @xcite,@xcite and @xcite , however , this is restricted to a small academic community .",
    "book and movie ratings are largely still done by established institutions , and thus the impact of online ratings and reviews is minimized when compared to the previous two examples @xcite@xcite .",
    "this is exemplified by various well - established entities , such as the oprah book club and the new york times , which have an enormous amount of influence in the area of book and film reviews .",
    "moreover , most online purchases of books are deliberate , or premeditated , when compared to `` spur of the moment '' decisions for dining choices in a college town .",
    "there have been a number of scholarly papers written extolling the virtues of on - line publication and reviews ; and there are an equal number of scholarly papers extolling the virtues of traditional publications , and condeming the biased peer reviews .",
    "the arguments for traditional publication include that peer reviews can not be replaced by blogs , twitter or anything else - because of the slow , deliberative process that emphasizes thoughtful scholarship behind traditional publication in journals.@xcite    restaurants ( especially in a college town ) generally have a very short life span .",
    "unless the restaurant is a chain , almost half of restaurant businesses may not last for more than 4 years @xcite .",
    "this scenario is also typical of many small businesses @xcite . according to bbc news @xcite",
    ", only 74 companies of the s&p 500 companies survived for more than 40 years .",
    "with so much uncertainty in college towns , it is often difficult to for a family business to continue past one generation .",

    "blanding@xcite applauds features in yelp in which reviewers have public profiles ( as in amazon , but not in trip advisor http://www.tripadvisor.com ) .",
    "however , according to @xcite , trip advisor provides more extensive options for sorting and categorizing reviews .",
    "a new york times blog @xcite cites that 2.5% of all users in march 2008 went to yelp ( http://www.yelp.com ) and the traffic has quadrupled since 2007 . according to alexa ( http://ww.alexa.com ) yelp",
    "is ranked 27th in us , and ranked 132 globally as of june 19 , 2014 . according to google trends http://www.google.com/trends/ , interest in yelp peaked in 2011 , and as of may 2014 , has an overall interest of 59 .",
    "yelp provides a level playing field for small restaurants , which may not be able to afford paying mass advertisement . to improve the trustworthiness of the reviews",

    "virginia tech    in this paper first we examine how ratings influence the quality of restaurants , and the cyclical nature of this behavior .",
    "we assume that to produce quality food , one has to continue to invest money on production , service and advertisement",
    ". however once the service is established and good ratings are obtained , continued investment on the components that contribute to the quality may drop .",
    "this results in a lower rating resulting in investment , and thereby improving the quality .",
    "we use a differential equation to model the ratings / quality of restaurants over a period of time .",
    "the solution to the linear second order differential equation describes the various features that we have observed in reviews over the years .",
    "the collective reviews converge on a stable value ( number ) , and individual restaurant reviews tend to demonstrate periodic behavior .",
    "the right hand side is a demand ( or the number of users ) to the restaurant , and we use three constants to model damping , average number of customers and the resilience of the restaurant",
    ".    a linear second order differential equation @xmath0 with appropriate initial conditions describes the motion of a spring .",
    "@xmath1 is the unit stretched from normal length , @xmath2 is the spring constant , @xmath3 is the mass , @xmath4 the damping factor and @xmath5 is a forcing function . in this research",
    "we use a similar model to explore the relationship between the services or the food quality , denoted by @xmath6 , of a restaurant ( we assume a relationship between @xmath6 and the ratings ) .",
    "the pull or , increase in the number of the customers , puts a strain on the restaurant , just as it would a physical spring . in springs ,",
    "one uses newton s second law of motion to arrive at the second order differential equation . in restaurants , one can use the law of conservation of the number of customers @xmath6 in the above function .",
    "the variable in restaurants , @xmath1 represents the change in ratings ( result of change in service / quality ) .",
    "the solution of this second order differential equation is either convergent , oscillatory or divergent depending upon the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    in the case of restaurants , we know the solution ,",
    "i.e. , the rating , can never diverge ( as the maximum rating is 5 and the minimum rating is 1 ) .",
    "we predict that the individual restaurant reviews will be periodic : that the damping factor @xmath4 will be very small .",
    "for example , the solution to the differential equation , for values of @xmath7 to be 1 and @xmath6 to be 10 , and @xmath8 to be 5 , demonstrates periodic behavior .",
    "since each individual restaurant has shows periodic behavior , we expect that the cumulative reviews will converge . we provide only a qualitative evidence and not a quantitative evidence ( by finding appropriate values for the parameters of the differential equation and initial conditions ) .",
    "however , there is an additional factor that complicates . even though each restaurant service / rating may be modeled as a second order differential equations ,",
    "these equations are coupled .",
    "this is the result of a free flow of capital , i.e. , chefs , among these restaurants . in our framework",
    ", we assume that these differential equations are uncoupled .",
    "if there are larger number of reviews / ratings for a few restaurants , we expect that the number of ratings follow a power law .",
    "this is similar to the power law feature in many social sciences networks @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we plot the number of reviews / ratings in log - log scale to illustrate the powerlaw .",
    "we provide heat maps of where most reviewed restaurants are located .",
    "the aim of this is to show that most reviewed restaurants are usually clustered together .",
    "this is an intuitive results , given that consumers have the option of choosing another ( equally good ) restaurant if the originally chosen restaurant is crowded .",
    "we have specifically focused on the wide fluctuation of ratings ( based on quality and service ) of restaurants around troy , ny over the period of time studied .",
    "the restaurant names , and the number of reviews for each restaurant are listed next in table [ tab : counts1 ] ( sorted by the most reviewed ones first ) . for the sake of brevity ,",
    "we have restricted the listing to only 30 names .",
    "however , our analysis includes the all the restaurants and services ( a total of 158 restaurants and services ) .",
    "even though we have tried to clean the data , more work is needed in this regard(i.e .",
    "some restaurant names are repeated ) .",

    "this may be due to attracting the overflow crowd , or just that these restaurants are situated in a popular area for dining .",
