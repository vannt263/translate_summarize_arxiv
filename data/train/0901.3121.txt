    "@xcite a variety of complex optical phenomena in many other pcps have been ascribed to interchain interactions .",
    "experiments that indicate the formation of interchain species upon photoexcitation include , ( i ) photoluminescence ( pl ) at longer wavelength relative to solutions , with smaller quantum efficiency , @xcite ( ii ) delayed pl lasting until milliseconds , and its quenching by an electric field , @xcite and ( iii ) _ additional _ photoinduced absorptions ( pas ) in ultrafast spectroscopy of films over and above those observed in solutions .",

    "these include , ( i ) neutral exciton delocalized over multiple chains , as in an aggregate , @xcite ( ii ) completely ionic polaron - pair , with positively and negatively charged neighboring chains that are coulombically bound , @xcite , and ( iii ) the charge - transfer ( ct ) exciton , which is a quantum mechanical superposition of the delocalized neutral exciton and the ionic polaron - pair that is obtained in the presence of significant interchain electron hopping .",
    "@xcite all three kinds of interchain species have been proposed to explain experiments in real systems .",
    "pl at wavelengths longer than in solutions with weaker quantum efficiency can be explained using the h - aggregate scenario , wherein absorption is to the highest state in the exciton band and emission occurs from the lowest state in the band .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , pa in films was originally thought to be from a polaron - pair state .",
    "@xcite very recently , wang _",
    "@xcite have claimed that the detailed features of the pa in films @xcite can be understood only within the ct exciton picture . according to wang _ et al . _",
    "a significant fraction of both pl and pa occur from the ct exciton .",
    "the calculations of the pa in reference were based on the single configuration - interaction ( sci ) approximation , and were able to reproduce only a limited low energy region of the experimental pa spectra .",
    "@xcite in the present work we go beyond sci and perform quadruple ci and multiple reference singles and double ci ( mrsdci ) calculations @xcite of excited state absorptions in interacting pairs of ppv oligomers to understand the pa spectra over the complete experimental energy range .",
    "our calculated pa spectra , originating from the ct exciton , exhibit strong qualitative agreement with the experimental pa spectra in films of ppv derivatives , @xcite in spite of the short lengths of the oligomers for which the many - body calculations could be performed .",

    "as in reference , we consider pairs of capped ppv oligomers 4 nm apart , stacked cofacially .",

    "these absorption energies can be strongly affected by electron - phonon interactions , which , however , have not been included in our @xmath6 .",

    "the arrows in the figures denote the charged chain absorption energies , relative to the energy of @xmath66 .",
    "the large differences between the charged - chain absorptions and pas labeled pp1 and pp2 are primarily due to the finite size effects associated with the very short system sizes being probed here , although additional contribution to this difference arises also from interchain coulomb interactions that influence the energies of the two - chain pas .",
    "we have calculated the pas from the two - chain optical exciton @xmath66 .",
    "pas nearly identical in energy to pa@xmath54 and pa@xmath55 are found , but the pas labeled ct , pp1 and pp2 are missing in this case , confirming the analysis of fig .  1 .",

    "a few additional points need to be emphasized .",
    "our earlier sci calculations were for pairs of oligomers 2 - 3 times longer,@xcite and from careful finite - size analysis we concluded that the features labeled ct and pa@xmath54 will continue to be seen for a broad range of realistic oligomer lengths . while it is not possible to do a similar finite size analysis for the qci and mrsdci calculations we report here , based on the previous analysis we are convinced that all pas in fig .  2 will similarly be seen at realistic chainlengths .",
    "the relative energy separations may , however , be strongly chain - length dependent .",
    "thus from the nature of the final states @xmath51 and @xmath68 in fig",
    ".  1 it is conceivable that the absorptions labeled ct and pp1 in fig .",
    "2 are energetically much closer in systems with realistic lengths , especially if electron - phonon interactions play a weak role .",
    "similarly , the relative locations of pp2 and pa@xmath55 may also depend on system size .",
    "both of these may have experimental consequences , as discussed in the next section .     in pairs of ( a ) ppv3 , and ( b ) ppv4 oligomers .",
    "all energies are relative to that of the neutral optical exciton .",
    "arrows denote energies of absorption from the ground states of charged chains.,width=336 ]",
    "within our theory , photoexcitation in films generates predominantly the optical exciton , along with small amounts of the ct exciton , which is weakly optically allowed due to disorder .",
    "@xcite pl is predominantly from the ct exciton , whose neutral component is the same as the lowest forbidden exciton state in a h - aggregate .",
    "the mechanism of light emission is therefore the same as in theories emphasizing aggregate formation .",
    "@xcite we believe that pa in films at the earliest times is predominantly from the optical exciton with weak contributions from the ct exciton , while at later times the pa is predominantly from the ct exciton .",
    "recent careful measurements have indicated that the pa labeled pa@xmath2 in films exhibit biexponential decay , which would agree with the two - state scenario .",
    "@xcite recent experiments on pentacene films support this viewpoint .",
    "@xcite additional support comes from the absence of free polarons , as noted in microwave conductivity measurements @xcite and terahertz spectroscopy , @xcite in spite of the experimentally observed pa bands p@xmath2 and p@xmath3 that resemble absorption from charged chains .",
    "we believe that an alternate possibility , viz . , pl is from the exciton but pa is from a bound polaron - pair , is precluded by the absence of room temperature infrared - active vibration ( irav ) in the recent pa experiment .",
    "@xcite unlike the ct exciton , the polaron - pair wavefunction is not affected by interchain charge - transfer and is asymmetric : _",
    "i.e. _ , a specific chain is positively charged while the other is negatively charged .",
    "the counterpart related by symmetry , with the charges on the two chains reversed , is missing in the polaron - pair , and hence pa even from the bound polaron - pair should be accompanied by strong irav .",
    "although strong irav has been reported by one research group , @xcite this results has not been reproduced by any other group .",
    "a key weakness of our theory in reference was that the pa spectrum could be calculated only for a limited energy range .",
    "this is remedied in the present work .",
    "our calculated pa spectra of fig .",
    "2 are to be compared with the experimental pa spectra of sheng _ et al . _",
    "( see figures 1 and 4 in reference ) .",
    "remarkable qualitative similarities between the calculated and experimental spectra are found , although from the theoretical spectrum it is difficult to distinguish between the two possible origins of the experimental p@xmath2 absorption . from our calculations ,",
    "the p@xmath2 absorption observed experimentally can be due to either the low energy charge - transfer absorption , or the absorption to the @xmath56 state .",
    "we suggest polarization - dependent experimental measurements to distinguish between these two possibilities : the charge - transfer absorption is polarized perpendicular to the molecular planes , while the absorption labeled pp1 is polarized along the chain direction in the molecular plane .",
    "yet another possibility is that _ the experimental p@xmath2 absorption is composed of two underlying absorptions .",
    "_ as pointed out in the previous section , in systems with realistic chain lengths these absorptions will be proximate in energy and can even be very close .",
    "in a recent experiment performed by vardeny _",
    "et al . _ on films of ppv derivatives , it has been found that the p@xmath2 absorption splits into two distinct peaks under hydrostatic pressure . @xcite",
    "whether or not these two pas have different origins , as might be expected from our calculations , or they arise from the splitting of the same absorption under the experimental conditions , is currently not clear , and further experimental work is necessary to clarify this issue . in conclusion",
    ", we have extended the mulliken theory of charge transfer to the case of excited state charge transfer , to develop a theory of the ct exciton in thin films of @xmath0-conjugated polymers .",
    "the central feature of our theory is that pa in films can occur from both the neutral exciton component of the ct exciton as well as from the charged bound polaron - pair component .",
    "pas from the exciton components occur at nearly the same wavelengths as those of the single chains that occur in dilute solutions .",
    "pas from the polaron - pair component occur at nearly the wavelengths where ground state absorptions of charged chains occur .",
    "interestingly , the absorptions from the polaron - pair component of the ct exciton are vanishingly weak in sci calculations and become visible only upon including higher order ci .",
    "in addition to these features , the pa spectrum can exhibit a low energy charge - transfer absorption .",
    "whether or not the low energy p@xmath2 absorption seen in pa measurements @xcite is a superposition of two fundamentally different absorptions is currently not understood , and will require further experimental work .",
    "there is no such ambiguity in the case of the absorption we have labeled pp2 : this is certainly the origin of the p@xmath3 absorption in the experiment .",
    "@xcite note , however , that the relative energies of pas labeled pp2 and pa@xmath55 in real systems can be slightly different from those predicted in fig .  2 , since electron - phonon interactions , ignored in our calculations , can have a strong effect on the energy of the pp2 absorption .",
    "the relative energies of these experimental pas can perhaps also be dependent on chain length , and hence may be more strongly conformation - dependent than the lower energy pas .",
    "this may explain the difference in the conclusions regarding the energy location of p@xmath3 between references and .",
    "work is currently in progress to include electron - phonon interactions in our pa calculations to probe this aspect further .",
