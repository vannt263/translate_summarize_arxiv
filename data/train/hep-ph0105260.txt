    "flavor - changing neutral - currents ( fcnc ) induced b - meson rare decays provide an ideal opportunity for extracting information about the fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) , testing the sm predictions at loop level and probing possible new physics .",
    "after the observation of the penguin - induced decay @xmath9 and the corresponding exclusive channels such as @xmath10@xcite , rare b - decays have begun to play an important role in the phenomenology of particle physics .",
    "the latest measured decay ratio for @xmath9 by cleo and belle@xcite is in good agreement with the sm prediction , putting strong constraints on its various extensions and therefore stimulating the study of radiative rare b - meson decays with a new momentum .    among rare b - meson decays ,",
    "@xmath1 @xmath11 are of special interest due to their relative cleanliness and sensitivity to models beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "since in these processes a photon is emitted in additional to the lepton pair , no helicity suppression exists and `` large '' branching ratio is expected .",
    "other interesting decay modes in this context are the inclusive transitions @xmath0 .",
    "although these rare decays have not been observed , their detection is expected at the b - factories which are currently running .",
    "these decays have been studied in the sm@xcite and recently , to reduce the theoretical uncertainties , the next - to - next - to leading order(nnlo ) corrections were completed @xcite .",
    "new physics effects in these decays have also been studied in some models , such as the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) @xcite , the two higgs doublet model(2hdm ) @xcite and the technicolor model@xcite .",
    "it is noticeable that in the sm the matrix elements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are strongly suppressed by a factor @xmath12 and the contributions from exchanging neutral higgs boson can be safely neglected . in the mssm @xcite ,",
    "the situation is different , specially in the case of @xmath13 with large @xmath2 . in this model ,",
    "as studied in @xcite , the contributions from exchanging neutral higgs bosons are enhanced roughly by a factor @xmath14 and may no longer be negligible since currently a large @xmath2 is favored both by lep experiments @xcite and by the supersymmetry ( susy ) explanation @xcite of the measurement for the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "we note that the most previous studies on the contributions from exchanging neutral higgs bosons @xcite mainly focused on the charged - current loop effects ; the effects of neutral - current loops ( ncl ) , such as gluino - loop and neutralino - loop , have been considered only for @xmath15 using mass insert approximation method in @xcite .",
    "a detail general calculation for such ncl effects is necessary .",
    "the ncl can be induced via the flavor mixing of down - type squarks and might be important for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , such flavor mixings of sfermions are almost unavoidable in supersymmetric models .",
    "in fact , in the framework of mssm sfermions may have arbitrary flavor mixings in the soft breaking terms ; while in some constrained mssm , such as low - energy supergravity models , the flavor mixings at weak scale could be naturally generated through renormalization equation even the flavor diagonality is assumed at the planck scale @xcite . secondly , the flavor mixings between the third and the second generation squarks are subject to no strong low - energy constraints like @xmath16 mixing .",
    "thirdly , the large @xmath2 will give rise to large mass splitting between two mass eigenstates of sbottoms , making the lighter sbottom ( @xmath17 ) even lighter .",
    "in this article , we will present a complete calculation of mssm effects in the decays @xmath1 and @xmath0 @xmath11 , taking into account the contributions from the neutral higgs exchange with ncl .",
    "we will evaluate the effects on branching ratios , the forward - backward asymmetry as well as the distributions of differential branching ratios . in section [ sec : mixing ] , we will give a brief description of the squark mixing in the mssm .",
    "the detailed calculations for wilson coefficients of scalar and pseudo - scalar operators are included in section [ sec : coeff ] .",
    "the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 are calculated in section [ sec : bstt ] .",
    "experimental constraints on the parameter space of the mssm are discussed in section [ constraints ] .",
    "some numerical results are presented in section [ sec : result ] . finally , in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we give our conclusion .",
    "the squark mass terms arise from the scalar potential which contains the supersymmetric f - term and d - term as well as the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "these soft breaking terms may have arbitrary flavor mixings . as a result",

    "@xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is the coefficient of the trilinear term @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) in soft - breaking terms and @xmath32 is ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .",
    "the hermitian matrices @xmath33 can be diagonalized by the unitary relations , which transfer the interaction eigenstates into the physical mass eigenstates .",
    "so in the general mssm , without knowing the mechanism of susy breaking , squarks could have arbitrary flavor mixings .    however , the flavor mixings in the first two generations are subject to strong phenomenological constraints , such as @xmath16 mixing .",
    "so we only consider the flavor mixings between the second and third generations , i.e. , between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "further , like the analysis in @xcite , we suppose the tree level lagrangian is flavor diagonal and the flavor mixing is induced via loops .",
    "the dominant effects are from the logarithmic divergences caused by soft breaking terms",
    ". such divergences must be subtracted using a soft counter - term at the susy breaking scale , such as planck scale @xmath36 .",
    "thus a large logarithm factor @xmath37 remains after renormalization . in the approximation of neglecting the strange quark mass",
