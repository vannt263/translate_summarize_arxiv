    "we neglect the effect of gravity at these epochs .",
    "we can do so because at late recombination epochs , the pressure of baryon - radiation plasma is low , and the negative pressure of a strange form of energy(dark energy ) , which starts to dominate at these epochs , cancels the effect of forces due to low pressure baryon - radiation plasma and that of gravity .",
    "we therefore write:@xmath130 also for @xmath131 , free - streaming of photons is no longer relevant .",
    "therefore the scattering of photons will dilute the anisotropy to a large extent .",
    "for late recombination epochs , when the radiation has almost decoupled from matter , we write : @xmath132    we have neglected gravity here again , because at these epochs , the effect of dark energy , which had started to dominate from some earlier epochs is to cancel the forces due to gravity and the pressure of baryon - radiation plasma .",
    "this is possible even in regions of lower baryon densities , which has higher pressure than the regions of higher baryon densities .",
    "this is only because the dark energy with negative pressure had been dominating from some earlier recombination epochs .",

    "we write the merscerskii equation for cold dark matter with baryon radiation plasma , ejecting out of concentrated regions of space dominated by cold dark matter : @xmath135 in an expanding flat , isotropic and homogenous universe , we write : @xmath136 therefore we write : @xmath137 we first discuss for scales @xmath138 i. e the curvature scale . in this case , we neglect the velocities of cold dark matter particles .",
    "this is because , there is not enough time to move highly non -relativistic cold dark matter upto distances greater than the hubble scale .",

    "it is because of the lowest baryon densities , in the coupled baryon -radiation plasma at these epochs .",
    "also we can see that the second term in the exponent in ( eq . 89)vanishes for very late recombination epochs , as ratio @xmath166 .",

    "the cdm density fluctuations will dominate the density perturbations of baryon - radiation plasma @xcite .",

    "the perturbations in the cold dark matter will cease to grow when the dark energy starts to dominate @xcite .",
    "we can interpret this from ( eq .",

    "this implies that the growth of fluctuations must have been driven by non - baryonic dark matter , which was not relativistic at recombination .",
    "also , we see that the perturbations at supercurvature scales grow slowly . recall that these are the modes which enter the horizon very early , well before the recombination epochs .",
    "the slow growth of such modes is because , it is only at late recombination epochs that the second term in the exponent in ( eq .",

    "[ sec:2])the acceleration of the cold dark matter reverses its sign when the baryon - radiation plasma is about to decouple from the cdm.in this model , the strongly coupled baryon - radiation plasma ejects out of a concentrated region of cold dark matter.the size of the dark matter region is @xmath233kpc and the outer skeletal region is of the order of @xmath234 kpc.thus , when the baryon - radiation plasma is just about to flow out of the outermost skeletal regions of cold dark matter , the acceleration of cdm particles undergoe sign reversal and they start accelerating towards the plasma.this happens in the same way for succesive layers of cdm which then start encircling the baryonic matter.we know from ( eq.36 ) that the acceleration of the dark matter is equal to the gradient of the gravitational potential of cdm.we can see that in the outermost skeletal layers of cdm , which are the first layers to start moving towards the plasma the baryonic matter will have the lowest acceleration.this is because as per our assumptions in the model assumed here , the outermost skeletal layers of cdm are always sparsely populated and their density follows an exponentially decreasing profile.therefore , they have less gradient of gravitational potential as compared to the inner layers of the skeletal region of dark matter.the innermost layers , which are the last ones to decouple from the ejecting baryon - radiation plasma are densely and uniformly populated with cold dark matter particles.so,they have a very high gradient of gravitational potential in these layers.this implies that the acceleration of the cdm particles is greatest in these regions .",
    "also , even these dm particles start to move towards the baryon - radiation plasma ejecting out of them.this is because they reverse their signs at epochs when the plasma decouples from the cdm.thus we see that the innermost layers of the skeletal structure of cdm which are the last ones to move towards the baryon - radiation plasma have the highest velocities.in the same way , the outermost layer of the skeletal structure of cdm which are the earliest ones to move towards the plasma have the lowest velocities . also , we know that the plasma , which is the first one to decouple from the dark mater region at early recombination epochs have highest baryon densities.this plasma which are the earliest one to decouple have lowest velocities.this is because they decouple from the outermost skeletal dark matter where the gradient of gravitation potential is weakest",
    ". the successive plasma which decouple from the dark matter regions at late recombination epochs will have lower baryon densities.this plasma which successively decouple from inner dm regions have higher velocities.this is because of high gradient of potential in these inner dm regions.the low velocity baryons in the plasma which are the earliest ones to decouple from skeletal dm regions get scattered by the high density faster moving baryons , which leave the inner dm regions at later epochs.these high density baryons decoupled at late epochs of recombination will act as a source for the following baryons of even higher densities , which decouple from the innermost dm regions.these following baryons coming successively from more inner regions of dm have linearly increasing velocities.the reason for its linear increase is the fact that during the epochs of decouplng , the increase in the baryon densities in the baryon - radiation plasma from early recombination epochs to last recombination epochs is directly related to a proportional increase in the velocity of sound of the plasma i.e. @xmath235 from @xmath236 to @xmath133.finally , the slowly moving dark matter will start encircling these central sources of baryonic matter.thus during galaxy formation the baryon desity approximately rises linearly from the nucleus outwards towards the disk.the size of the disk consisting of the baryonic material and dust will extend upto @xmath237 kpc for a dm region of size of @xmath16kpc.this we try to estimate in the paragraph below : + we know that the ratio of the density of baryons to that of dark matter at any epoch is : @xmath238 we know from ( eq.25)that the ratio of baryon to photon density between equality to recombination is : @xmath239 where @xmath240is the average of the square of the speed of sound .",

    "the ones with the lowest velocities get scattered away by the high velocity baryons coming from the inner dm regions at later epochs.so,the baryons from the successive inner dm regions are scattered lesser and lesser.therefore,the probability of the baryons remaining in the inner regions of galaxies is proportional to their velocities.in our case , we assume that the clustering of baryons in the inner regions of disk starts from those baryons which leave the dm regions at approximately halfway between early and late recombination epochs i.e.z@xmath253 . thus , inside the galactic disk the rate of increase of the baryonic densities from the galactic distance will be approximately proportional to the rate of increase of baryonic velocities with the distance from the galactic centre . + the baryons which are the earliest ones to leave the skeletal dm regions have very low velocities .therefore , they are scattered by the baryons with higher and higher velocities , which successively leave from the inner regions of dm having high gravitational potential.so,we assume that the clustering of baryons will start at epochs which are approximately halfway between epochs of early and late recombination i.e. @xmath254.to calculate the baryonic densities at @xmath254,we use @xmath255 where @xmath256 and @xmath257is the critical density of matter today.here @xmath258.thus , we get @xmath259 since , the scaling factor a corresponding to @xmath260 is @xmath261,the effective densities today will be @xmath262 so , we write @xmath263 since , baryons dominate the inner regions of such massive dark matter dominated galaxies upto @xmath264 kpc , where r is the distance from the galactic centre.therefore for @xmath265 kpc , we use ( eq.142 ) and ( eq.143 ) to write @xmath266 therefore we get @xmath267 the region between @xmath268 kpc , which was earlier the outer dm skeletal region of dark matter will now form the innermost region of the dm halo starting from the galactic centre.this is the region from where the baryons decouple at early recombination epochs i.e. @xmath269,we write for dm densities @xmath270 where @xmath271 .",

    "the dynamics of feebly , self - interacting , collisionless , cold dark matter using variable mass formalism of merscerskii provides a new simple explanation for the observed rotation curves of massive dm dominated lsb galaxies.it also correctly explains the cmb , one of the important pillars of modern cosmology.the l.h.s . of ( eq .",
    "2 ) proves that the cold dark matter can feel some pressure due to its heavy mass and small fluctuations in its velocity due to self-interactions.thus slowing out of such a feebly self - interacting dm can justify some recent galaxy mergers , wherein the galaxies outrun dark matter . we conclude that this model , produces new results , which relate the oscillations in the cmb anisotropy to the ejection velocity of the baryon -radiation plasma ( eq . 31).we know that the height of the second peak in the cmb is particularly sensitive to the baryon - to - photon ratio.thus,the presence of the ejection velocity which is sensitive to the baryon -to - photon ratio gives a good tool for numerical work , with regard to exploring the oscillations of cmb in relation to their dependence on the ejection velocity.the assumptions in the model ( eq .",
    "27 ) which ensure the equilibrium of coupled baryon -radiation plasma at all epochs between equality and recombination , even in the presence of dark matter is a strong statement for the collisionless nature of cdm .the l.h.s . of ( eq .",
    "2 ) is possible only because the cold dark matter can feel some pressure due to its heavy mass and small fluctuations in its velocity due to self-interactions.the results of ( eq .",

    "127 ) describe the affect of the perturbations in the cold dark matter on the cmb temperature anisotropy fluctuations .",
    "they also highlight that the dominant component of cmb temperature anisotropy fluctuations is at red - shifts of very late recombination epochs @xmath291 .",
    "this is because the perturabtions in the cold dark matter are minimal at these epochs but not zero as the average of the potential between epochs of equality and recombination has been considered.the assumptions of ( eq .",
    "32 ) and ( eq .",
    "111 ) , assume the growth of a strange form of energy(dark energy ) , with negative pressure , which cancels the force due to the pressure of baryon - radiation plasma .",
    "these assumptions also represent the fact that the rate of increase of ejection velocity of the baryon -radiation plasma is only due to the gravitational field of the cold dark matter .",
    "it can be inferred that the force due to its pressure can vanish only to some extent due to low pressure in high baryonic density regions .",
    "this is due to early primordial helium nucleosynthesis in such regions . since the baryonic densities can never be very high before recombination",
    "this is because it will hinder the hydrogen nucleosynthesis which starts after recombination .",
    "therefore , it has to be assumed that the primary reason for the vanishing of pressure of baryon - radiation plasma , at near recombination epochs , is that the dark energy term with negative pressure starts to dominate at these epochs.thus the correct explanation of the sachs - wolfe effect and the pridominant cmb temperature anisotropy at late recombination epochs based on this model , strongly argue in favor of the collisionless , feebly self - interacting nature of cold dark matter .",
    "this model gives new results , which can be important for further exploring the second peak of cmb .",
    "more accurate results can be obtained by studying the dynamics of baryon -radiation plasma using energy momentum tensor of an imperfect fluid in such a scenario .",
    "this will be attempted in a future work .",
