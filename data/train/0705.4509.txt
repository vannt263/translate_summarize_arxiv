    "spectroscopic measurements on magnetometers nb1 and al1 revealed comparable variations in t@xmath27 , from about 4 to 10 ns in the same frequency range @xcite . since t@xmath27 is sensitive to low - frequency noise ( inhomogenous broadening ) , as well as pure dephasing and dissipation @xcite , we can conclude that the combined effect of low - frequency noise , pure dephasing and dissipation is comparable in the three devices .",
    ", width=3 ]    to distinguish the effects of low - frequency noise from dephasing processes , we also measured rabi oscillations .",
    "the idea is that the envelope decay time constant t@xmath31 of a rabi oscillation is sensitive to noise at the rabi frequency while the main effect of noise at much lower frequencies ( which acts like inhomogenous broadening ) is to change the shape of the envelope @xcite .",
    "this relative insensitivity of the rabi oscillation to low - frequency noise is similar to the situation in a spin - echo measurement @xcite . the envelope decay time constant t@xmath31 , the energy relaxation time t@xmath1 , and the coherence time t@xmath2",
    "are related by @xcite @xmath32 when the rabi oscillation is driven on resonance .",
    "although spin - echo measurements are the best way to directly determine t@xmath2 and distinguish pure dephasing from inhomogenous broadening , we were not able to measure spin echoes in these devices due to their relatively short coherence times . finally , from seperate measurements , we find t@xmath1 is roughly 50 ns .",
    "figure 4 shows typical examples of measured rabi oscillations in the total escape rate for the three devices .",
    "we applied microwave frequencies of 7.6 ghz for nb1 at 25 mk [ see fig .",
    "4(a ) ] , 7 ghz for al1 at 80 mk [ see fig .",
    "4(b ) ] and 6.5 ghz for nbg at 100 mk [ see fig .",
    "the applied microwaves coupled to the qubit junction via a small capacitor [ see fig . 1 and fig . 2 ] and resonantly drove the qubit between @xmath33 and @xmath23 . in each case",
    ", we observed clear oscillations in the escape rate . in these plots , t",
    "= 0 indicates when the microwaves were turned on .    the solid curves in fig .",
    "4 are least - square fits to a cosine function with an exponential envelope with time constant t@xmath31 . from the fits ,",
    "t@xmath31 for the gradiometer nbg was about 12 ns , while for magnetometers nb1 and al2 it was about 12 ns and 27 ns , respectively ( see table 2 ) .",
    "density matrix simulations reveal that the escape rate we observe is dominated by a small population in @xmath34 that escapes very rapidly ( @xmath35 1/s @xmath4 1/t@xmath31 ) , and this population is directly proportional to the occupancy of @xmath23 which escapes much more slowly ( @xmath36 1/s ) . while tunneling contributes to spectroscopic broadening @xcite , measurements over a wide range of conditions with different escape rates did not alter t@xmath31 for rabi oscillations in the total escape rate @xcite .",
    "thus the single - turn aluminum magnetometer al1 had a substantially longer envelope decay time t@xmath31 than either the nb magnetometer or the nb gradiometer . from this comparison",
    ", we can safely conclude that t@xmath31 in our dc squid phase qubits is not being limited by spatially uniform flux noise .",

    "in conclusion , we have measured the spectroscopic coherence time t@xmath27 and rabi oscillations in three dc squid phase qubits .",
    "one device was a nb gradiometer with 6-turn wound and counter - wound coils , the second was an al magnetometer made with a single - turn loop , and the third was a nb magnetometer with a 6-turn coil .",
