    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are sporadic ejections of magnetized plasma from the sun with masses in the order of 10@xmath210@xmath3  g @xcite and velocities in the range of @xmath41003000  km  s@xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "they are accelerated by magnetic forces in the solar corona and move outwards into the interplanetary space , where they may severely influence the space weather near the earth .",
    "several case studies of the cme kinematics @xcite showed that cmes typically undergo three phases : a gradual evolution , fast acceleration and propagation phase @xcite . in the gradual phase ,",
    "the cme leading edge rises slowly with velocities of some ten km  s@xmath5 . at a certain height ,",
    "the cme undergoes a strong acceleration . how fast and how long the acceleration takes place varies from event to event . after the main impulsive acceleration phase the cme propagates at almost constant velocity or shows a gradual acceleration / deceleration due to the interaction with the ambient solar wind flow during the propagation in the interplanetary space ( e.g.",
    "recent studies suggest that the main acceleration of impulsive cmes occurs at low coronal heights , which are not observable in traditional white light coronographic images @xcite .",
    "thus , if we are interested in the origin of cmes and their initial acceleration , we have to observe them from their initiation site close to the solar surface . to observe fast cme accelerations",
    "it is important to have image sequences with high time cadence during this important dynamical phase of the cmes . since fast and impulsive events severely contribute to our space weather , they are particularly relevant to study",
    ".    acceleration measurements of the early phase of the cme propagation for a statistical sample of 50 events were done by @xcite , who used coronagraphic observations from 1.1  @xmath1 to 30  @xmath1 ( lasco c1 , c2 and c3 ) , before the lasco c1 coronagraph failed in 1998 due to the communication loss with the soho spacecraft .",

    "paper statistics and correlation analysis of the kinematical and dynamical cme characteristics are presented . in our parameter study",
    "we focus on the cme peak velocity , peak acceleration , acceleration duration , height at peak velocity , height at peak acceleration , initiation height and the cme source region size .",
    "the relation of the cme characteristics to the associated flare , filament eruption , large scale euv waves and magnetic topology will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the sun - earth - connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ( secchi ) package @xcite onboard the twin stereo spacecraft , stereo - a ( ahead ) and stereo - b ( behind ) , includes an extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) imager ( euvi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , two white light coronagraphs ( cor1 , cor2 ) and two white light heliospheric imagers ( hi1 , hi2 ) , observing the sun in different fovs .",
    "we combined data from euvi , cor1 and cor2 , in order to study the kinematics of cmes from their initiation close to the solar surface up to a distance of about 15 @xmath1 .",
    "euvi observes the solar chromosphere and low corona in four different wavelengths in a fov up to 1.7 @xmath1 . to track a cme we mostly used images in the 171    passband because of the high time cadence up to 75 sec , but in some cases it was only possible to track the cme in the 195    observations , which on average have a lower time cadence ( for most events 10 minutes , but in some cases as good as 2.5 minutes ) .",
    "the high time cadence enabled us to obtain detailed acceleration profiles especially at the beginning of the cme propagation .",
    "the two stereo coronagraphs cor1 and cor2 observe the inner and outer solar corona in a fov of 1.4 to 4 @xmath1 and 2.5 to 15  @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the overlapping fovs of all three instruments enabled us to connect the same structure in the observations by the different instruments .",
    "the time cadence of the cor1 observations is mainly 5 minutes but can be up to 20 minutes in some cases , the cadence of cor2 is 30 minutes .",
    "we started our study with a sample of 146 selected cme events .",
    "for our selection we preferred events that could be observed already in the low corona ( i.e. by the euvi instrument ) , in order to get insights in the early phase of the cme dynamics .",
    "in addition , we required that the source region of a cme could be identified on the visible solar hemisphere , for which we used the location of associated flares as an additional marker .",
    "not each event fulfills both requirements ( 99 events could be measured in the euvi fov , for 89 events a flare could be associated ) . in most cases",
    "the associated flares were weak .",
    "five events were associated with an m class flare , 26 cmes with a c  class flare .",
    "the remaining flares were of goes class b or below .",
    "the final cme sample for the statistics presented in this paper comprises a set of 95 events , for which we could derive the full cme acceleration profile , i.e. the peak acceleration and the acceleration duration could be measured for each cme .",
    "84 out of them were tracked starting from the euvi fov .",
    "all data were reduced by the secchi solar software routine ` secchi\\_prep ` .",
    "the euvi image sequences were corrected for differential rotation , and for weak events a normalizing - radial - graded filter ( nrgf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used . for the cor1 and cor2 observations",
    "a pre - event image was subtracted .",
    "in addition , a sigma filter and a normalization technique were applied to get better contrasts of the transient faint cme structures . for the measurements of the cme evolution , running difference and running ratio images",
    "were reconstructed .",
    "we derived the cme kinematics by measuring the position of the cme leading edge in euvi , cor1 and cor2 images . in order to obtain reliable and reproducible measurements ,",
    "an algorithm was developed which semi - automatically determines the position of the cme leading edge in euvi , cor1 and cor2 running difference images .",
    "the leading edge of a cme appears as a bright front with a sharp intensity drop to regions outside the cme .",
    "this information is the basis for the algorithm developed to identify quasi - automatically the cme leading edge and its evolution in subsequent images .",
    "the algorithm works in the following way : the running difference images are contoured with brightness levels starting at very low , positive intensities .",
    "then the distances of the pixels on the outermost contour with respect to sun center are calculated .",
    "this process is repeated with contours at incrementally increasing brightness levels until the mean distance derived from two subsequent contour levels are separated by a sufficiently small , prescribed distance of each other .",
    "the position of the last determined contour is supposed to provide the location of the cme leading edge .",
    "the result can be manually corrected if necessary ( e.g. , if image artifacts are included in the contour , or if the cme front is not well defined ) .",
    "we note that faint cmes were mostly measured by visual identification of the cme leading edge , since here the algorithm fails .",
    "figures [ sequence ] and [ sequence1 ] show examples of euvi , cor1 and cor2 running difference image sequences of two well observed cmes , where the identified cme leading edge and the determined propagation direction are indicated .",
    "we assumed a propagation along a straight line and defined for each event a direction , which crosses the outermost part of the cme front .",
    "the cme distance was derived by following the evolution of the identified cme leading edge along this main propagation direction . in a few cases a linear propagation could not be assumed due to deflection towards the heliospheric current sheet . for these events , the outermost part of the measured cme leading edge",
    "was manually selected in each frame .",
    "the distance was averaged over an angular extent of @xmath6 of the determined leading edge and measured from the cme source region , which allows us to follow the cme propagation even if it deviates from radial direction .",
    "there are several factors affecting the determination of the cme leading edges and several possible sources for systematic errors . on the one hand ,",
    "the cme itself can change its appearance with time , e.g. , the front might become blurred which makes it difficult to track the same feature over several solar radii .",
    "on the other hand , we combine observations of different instruments with different angular resolution and the detection sensitivity varies over the fov . in addition , stray light levels are different for cor1 and cor2 , influencing the appearance of the observed white light feature . in order to estimate",
    "the average error included in our kinematical measurements , we analysed some selected cmes in detail . for each of these events we followed four times the tracked cme leading edge in time in euvi ,",
    "cor1 and cor2 images . for each run ,",
    "the scaling of the images was chosen differently , in order to account for the different visibilities of the outer ( fainter ) cme features . from the thus obtained height - time measurements , we derived the mean and standard deviation at each instant from the different measurement runs .",
    "the results from this procedure suggest an average error of 0.03 @xmath1 for measurements in euvi , 0.125 @xmath1 in cor1 , and 0.3 @xmath1 in cor2 data , respectively .",
    "numerical differentiation of the height - time curve provides the cme velocity and acceleration profiles as a function of time . due to the fact that errors in the height - time curve are enhanced by the first and second derivative ,",
    "a smoothing and fitting method is used .",
    "we used a spline fitting procedure in which the measured cme height - time profile is subdivided into consecutive segments .",
    "all segments are then fitted by cubic splines and at their end points ( ` nodes ' ) , the functions merge continuously and are twice continuously differentiable .",
    "the users s input to the fitting procedure is the number and position of nodes .",
    "the spline - fitted curve is then used as the basis to derive the velocity and acceleration evolution by subsequent numerical differentiation . in the course of",
    "fitting , we also estimated errors for the velocity and acceleration for each of the fitted segments . for each segment",
    ", the uncertainties on the polynomial spline coefficients are derived .",
    "the errors on the velocity and acceleration were then determined via gaussian error propagation .",
    "the advantage of using this method is that it provides reasonable errors ( especially for the acceleration ) also in cases of a high time cadence , where the classical error estimates using two neighbouring points yield typically very high errors for the cme accelerations .",
    "different sets of nodes giving similar fits for a certain height - time curve may reveal considerably different velocity and acceleration profiles ( for details see appendix in * ? ? ?",
    "a fit was preferred over the other if the errors in velocity and acceleration were smaller , which basically confined the number of nodes to 5 to 7 .    to estimate the cme source region size we used different methods , described in detail in @xcite :    * the distance between bipolar coronal dimming regions derived from euvi 195    or 171    observations ; * the footpoint separation of the associated eruptive filament / prominence observed in euvi 304    images ; * the lengths of the flare ribbon brightenings observed in the chromosphere or transition region measured in euvi 304 , 171 or 195    images .         with a binsize of 0.1  @xmath1 .",

    "the residual acceleration can be positive for two reasons .",
    "on the one hand , in slow and gradual events the ambient solar wind flow causes a further acceleration . on the other hand",
    "it is also possible that the cme accelerates continuously due to continuous energy release after the main phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we note that we interpret the parameter @xmath15 , defined as the height where a cme is first observed , to be a measure of the initiation height of the erupting cme ( and thus , to some extent , also to be a measure of the original size of the erupting structure ) .",
    "this is of course somewhat critical , since in gradual and faint cmes we expect that we can not really observe a cme from its very inititiation site ( due to the limited sensitivity ) but only further out when sufficient mass was accumulated at the cme front to be observable .",
    "indeed , in 11 out of 95 events we could not find signatures of the erupting cme in the euvi but only in the cor1 fov .",
    "this may be a real effect , i.e. some cmes in our sample started at heights @xmath72 , but may be partly also biased by the fact that the cme actually started at lower heights but was to faint to be observed .",
    "however , even if we underestimated the cme initiation height by using the height @xmath15 where the cme was first observed , the distinct correlations that we obtained between @xmath15 and other characteristic cme quantities such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in line with the interpretations in terms of the lorentz force elaborated above , support it to be a very useful quantity for cme initiation studies .    since during its propagation the size of a cme increases with height",

    "the distinct inverse proportionality that we derived between @xmath12 and @xmath14 ( summary item no .",

    "taking into account that the acceleration time can not be shorter than the alfvn wave signal transit time , we get the order - of - magnitude relation : @xmath73 i.e. , cmes originating from compact sources accelerate more impulsively , consistent with our summary item no . 13 ( fig .",
