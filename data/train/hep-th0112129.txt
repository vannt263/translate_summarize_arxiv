    "constraint equations are derived in section 5 from a consistency condition of these maps and from the holonomy group of a 3-space that is flat except for the strings . the special case of small angle deficits is also considered in this section .",

    "0      we shall first consider the large class of thorny spheres @xmath24 ( e.g. , all those with three or more conical singularities , all of which have positive deficit angles ) that are both isometrically embeddable into euclidean 3-space ( in a unique manner , up to overall translations and rotations ) and also have their geometries uniquely defined by the edge lengths of geodesic triangulations with the vertices at the conical singularities .",
    "if @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the number of triangles , edges and vertices for the triangulation , then the euler theorem gives @xmath28 since each triangle has 3 edges and each edge belongs to two triangles , we have @xmath29 .",
    "( thus the total number of triangles is always even . ) from this relation and the euler theorem , we get @xmath30    except at the conical singularities at the vertices of the triangles , the thorny sphere has constant gaussian curvature @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 being the ricci scalar curvature ) which we shall take to be unity , and hence each triangle can be isometrically mapped to a spherical triangle on the unit sphere .",
    "consider a spherical triangle with vertices 1,2,3 .",
    "its edges are parts of great circles on the sphere .",
    "denote by @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 the lengths of the triangle , and by @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 its interior angles at the vertices 1,2,3 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the edge @xmath18 is opposite to the @xmath20th vertex . for given lengths of the edges ,",
    "the angles are uniquely defined , assuming as we shall that they are all less than @xmath39 ( which is indeed the case when the deficit angles are all positive ) . in particular one",
    "has @xmath40 the triangle can be also specified by its angles .",
    "the lengths of the edges can be determined by using the relation @xmath41 we also shall use the following expression for the area @xmath42 of a spherical triangle : @xmath43    because the edges of the triangles are geodesics of the thorny sphere , adjacent triangles match without producing any singularities along the edges , except at the vertices .",
    "there one gets a deficit angle @xmath14 that is @xmath44 minus the sum of the interior angles of the triangles at that vertex .",
    "thus the entire geometry of each @xmath24 is uniquely determined by the @xmath45 edge lengths of the triangulation , which can be all specified independently , within an open set of the @xmath46-parameter space that is restricted by certain inequalities ( e.g. , triangular inequalities ) .",
    "( for @xmath47 , there is no triangulation , and @xmath48 , but there is a one - parameter family of thorny spheres of arbitrary deficit angle @xmath49 . see appendix b. )    if the deficit angles are all positive , the thorny sphere @xmath24 has nonnegative gaussian curvature @xmath50 everywhere , unit curvature everywhere away from the conical singularities and dirac delta - function curvature at the singularities . the contribution of these two parts of the curvature to the gauss - bonnet theorem is @xmath51    therefore a thorny sphere can be isometrically rigidly ( i.e. , uniquely up to overall translations and rotations ) embedded as a convex surface @xmath24 in 3-dimensional euclidean space @xcite,@xcite .",
    "let @xmath52 be the outward normal to the embedded surface at each point .",
    "one can then map each point of @xmath24 to a corresponding point of a unit round @xmath0 also embedded in the 3-dimensional euclidean space that has the same unit normal @xmath52 .",
    "this map is known as the gaussian normal map of the convex surface @xmath24 into @xmath0 .",
    "the gaussian normal map is discussed in more detail in appendix a , where it is shown that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the area element on @xmath24 and @xmath55 is the corresponding area element on @xmath0 ( with the same corresponding set of unit normal vectors @xmath52 in the embedding euclidean 3-space ) .    from the divergence theorem applied to the interior of @xmath24 , one can easily prove @xmath56 and from the divergence theorem applied to the interior of @xmath0 , one can similarly prove @xmath57    the unit normal @xmath52 to the embedding @xmath24 of a thorny sphere is not well defined at each conical singularity . as one goes around the @xmath20th conical singularity infinitesimally close to it , the unit normal @xmath52 to the embedding ( well defined everywhere except at the conical singularities themselves , and hence defining a smooth gaussian normal map from that smooth part of @xmath24 into the round @xmath0 of unit - normal directions ) sweeps out a topological circle on the round sphere @xmath0 of possible directions for the unit normal , with the area of the disk @xmath58 within this topological circle on the round @xmath0 being the deficit angle @xmath14 .",
    "the set of these @xmath16 disks is the part of the round @xmath0 that is not mapped into from the smooth part of the @xmath24 but instead represents the conical singularities .",
    "thus in the case that @xmath14 is not infinitesimal , the direction of the unit normal at that conical singularity is spread out over this cone ( the disk @xmath58 on the @xmath0 ) and has an angular uncertainty of the order of @xmath59 .      the integral of eq .",
    "( [ d3 ] ) is the same as what it would be if one excluded the zero - area conical singularities and inserted the unit curvature @xmath50 for reg@xmath60 , the smooth part of @xmath24 : @xmath61 if one subtracts the second integral here from that of the second integral of eq .",
    "( [ d4 ] ) , one gets @xmath62 which is one version of what we shall call the constraint equation for the thorny sphere , restricting the orientation of its conical singularities in the embedding euclidean 3-space .",
    "one can regard this constraint as arising from the fact that we have restricted the thorny sphere to have constant gaussian curvature everywhere except at the conical singularities , and this restricts three combinations of the strengths and positions of these singularities .",
    "a more physical interpretation of the constraint is as a force - balance equation , to which we now turn .",
    "one can define @xmath63 which can be interpreted as the force , defined as a vector in the embedding euclidean 3-space that can trivially be parallely transported over it and added to other such forces , exerted by a string that produces the angle deficit angle @xmath14 at the @xmath20th conical singularity .",
    "since the area of the disk @xmath58 is @xmath64 ( see the proof in appendix a ) , one can write @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the normal @xmath52 averaged over the area of the disk @xmath58 : @xmath67    for @xmath68 , each disk @xmath58 is nearly round , and the averaged normal will have the length @xmath69 with this relation being exact when the disk @xmath58 is precisely round .",
    "thus the length is nearly unity when @xmath14 is small , but it decreases below that to a minimum value of @xmath70 when @xmath14 is increased to its maximum value of @xmath44 ( assuming a round disk @xmath58 , which one indeed gets in the case of just two conical singularities , a case in which the geometry is not determined by the geodesic distances between conical singularities , simply @xmath39 in this case , but which involves an arbitrary deficit angle @xmath49 and is discussed in appendix b ) .    for an opposite extreme case ,",
    "in which @xmath71 and in which the embedding of the thorny sphere gives the two sides of a convex polygon , the deficit angle at a vertex is @xmath44 minus twice the corresponding interior angle of the polygon ( since the surface @xmath24 corresponds to both sides ) , and the disk @xmath58 is one interior lune - shaped region between two great circles that intersect at angle @xmath14 .",
    "then one can show that in this extreme case , @xmath72 which for small @xmath14 has the limit @xmath73 rather than the limit of unity that eq .",
    "( [ d15 ] ) has .",
    "thus for eq .",
    "( [ d15 ] ) to be valid , it is required that the disk @xmath58 be nearly round , for which it is not sufficient merely that @xmath14 be small , but also that the effects of all the other conical singularities on the embedding also be small .    in terms of the precisely - defined forces",
    "@xmath74 , the constraint equation ( [ d6 ] ) becomes the force - balance equation that the sum of these forces vanishes : @xmath75 this is one precise version of the constraint equation for arbitrary possible positive deficit angles .",
    "one way to visualize this constraint equation is to imagine that one covers the disks @xmath58 of the round @xmath0 with some material with constant mass per unit area .",
    "then the constraint equation is the condition that the center of mass of the @xmath16 disks be at the center of the round sphere .",
    "although this form of the constraint equation is easily visualizable and is precisely valid for general deficit angles ( so long as they allow the thorny sphere to be rigidly embedded in euclidean 3-space , which will be the case for positive deficit angles but need not be so for negative deficit angles ) , it is not very convenient for calculations , since for @xmath76 it is a rather difficult procedure to construct the embedding of a thorny sphere into euclidean 3-space .",
    "therefore , it is also useful to look at other ways of representing thorny spheres , which we shall do in section 4 .",
    "let us emphasize that the above results can be generalized . instead of a thorny sphere one may consider a _",
    ", that is a closed 2-dimensional surface with conical singularities and arbitrary smooth metric outside them .",
    "we assume that this metric has positive gaussian curvature @xmath50 so that it can be isometrically embedded in euclidean 3-space as a closed convex surface . as it is shown in appendix a , the constraint equation ( [ d11 ] ) is modified and takes the form @xmath77 where @xmath50 is the gaussian curvature of @xmath24 .",
    "we call this relation a _ generalized constraint equation_. the presence of non - constant gaussian curvature in the right - hand side of this equation makes possible the existence of new configurations , e.g. with a single conical singularity .",
    "see the discussion of @xmath78-metrics in appendix a for some interesting physical applications of the generalized constraint equation .",
    "0      in this section we describe how to construct a thorny sphere starting with a triangulation of a regular unit sphere @xmath0 ( see also @xcite ) . in the next section",
    "we describe the mapping of thorny spheres into round spheres embedded in three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "we start construction of a thorny sphere by taking a regular unit sphere with an arbitrary given triangulation of it , using spherical triangles . as above , let @xmath27 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 be the number of vertices , edges , and triangles for the triangulation , with eqs .",
    "( [ 0.3a ] ) , ( [ 0.3 ] ) , and ( [ 0.3b ] ) applying for the geometry of each triangle .",
    "now let us cut from the triangulation a spherical quadrangle @xmath81 which consists of two triangles with a common edge between vertices 2 and 3 ; see fig .",
    "[ quadra ] .",
    "we denote the length of this common edge by @xmath33 .",
    "the other edges have lengths @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 for the first and second triangles , respectively .",
    "denote by @xmath84 a new spherical quadrangle for which the length of the common edge is @xmath85 , while the other lengths are the same .",
    "this change of the length @xmath33 results in the change of angles of each of two triangles which can be found by using ( [ 0.3 ] ) . in this procedure",
    "the lengths @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 of the edges of @xmath84 remain the same as for @xmath81 .",
    "that is why the modified spherical quadrangle @xmath84 can be glued back into a cut sphere .",
    "the resulting surface will be smooth everywhere except at 4 vertices where angle deficits will appear .",
    "we call this procedure an _ elementary deformation _ of the sphere .    for a given triangulation",
    ", one can use @xmath79 elementary deformations independently to fix all of the edge lengths ( and hence also all the deficit angles ) and thus to determine the @xmath46-parameter metric on a generic thorny sphere with @xmath16 conical singularities .",
    "however , if we have the goal of fixing required deficit angles at the @xmath86 vertices , not all of the elementary deformations have independent effects upon them .",
    "some combinations of these deformations do not generate angle deficits , but simply move vertices of the triangulation along the sphere .",
    "the number of such ` degrees of freedom ' that do not affect the deficit angles is @xmath87 ( two ` degrees of freedom ' per vertex minus 3 ` degrees of freedom ' corresponding to rigid rotations of the sphere which preserve the lengths of each edge unchanged ) .",
    "thus the total number of ` real degrees of freedom ' which generate deformations in the angle deficits is @xmath88 .",
    "these deformations are sufficient to create the required angle deficits at all the @xmath16 vertices except 3 .",
    "this is exactly what one can expect in a general case , since there exist exactly 3 consistency conditions in the vector constraint equations ( [ i0 ] ) and ( [ i1 ] ) relating angle deficits and positions of the singular points on the thorny sphere .",
    "the above counting of the ` degrees of freedom ' gives us also the following useful information .",
    "let us fix the values of all @xmath16 angle deficits @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath89 ` degrees of freedom ' characterizing the positions of the vertices must obey 3 constraint equations .",
    "we can also use 3 ` degrees of freedom ' of the rigid rotation of the sphere to put , say , the first point to the north pole of the sphere , and the second one on the meridian @xmath90 .",
    "after this there remains @xmath91 free parameters . by adding to them the @xmath16 parameters @xmath14 we return to the @xmath92 parameters of a generic thorny sphere with @xmath16 conical singularities",
    "now to illustrate the nature of these constraints we discuss a case when all angle deficits are infinitesimally small .",
    "consider an infinitesimal elementary deformation of a spherical quadrangle @xmath81 shown on fig .",
    "[ quadra ] . to produce conical singularities one can deform the length of the common edge @xmath93 while keeping the lengths of the other edges unchanged .",
    "this deformation changes internal angles at vertices 1,2,3,4 and yields conical singularities .",
    "let us introduce the following notations @xmath94 where @xmath15 are the unit vectors ( with the beginning at the center of the sphere ) which define the positions of the corresponding vertices .",
    "if @xmath18 is the length of the edge opposite to the @xmath20th vertex , then @xmath95 , which is true for triangles whose edges are arcs of great circles . for triangles on @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ 0.3 ] ) gives , @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "analogous relations for @xmath99 can be obtained from ( [ 17 ] ) by replacing @xmath100 by @xmath101 .",
    "variations of @xmath102 produce changes of the angles @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "the condition that these variations do not change @xmath105 can be written in linear order as @xmath106 @xmath107 to get the last line we used ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "a similar relation follows from the variation of @xmath108 .",
    "their combination yields @xmath109 @xmath110 where we took into account that @xmath111 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath112 , and @xmath113 are the conical angle deficits produced by the deformation at the vertices @xmath114 .",
    "consider the particular form of ( [ i1 ] ) when only these four vertices have nonzero deficit angles : @xmath115 under projecting it on the vector @xmath116 we get exactly ( [ 19 ] ) .    to get eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) directly , and not just its projection on @xmath116 , we can do some further algebra and find that for each of the two spherical triangles with only the length @xmath33 perturbed , @xmath117 @xmath118 when these two equations are added , the right hand sides cancel , and one gets eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) .",
    "a generalization of this linearized vector condition to finite deformations will be given in the next sections .",
    "as we already mentioned , there exists an embedding of a thorny sphere in flat space ( at least for positive deficit angles ) .",
    "but practically it is very difficult to obtain this embedding explicitly and get the precisely - defined forces @xmath74 for the force balance equation ( [ d11 ] ) unless the angle deficits are small .",
    "an exception for large deficits is a simple case when a thorny sphere has two conical singularities , see appendix b. ( this case is not covered by section 2 since it can not be triangulated using as vertices only the two conical singularities ) .",
    "therefore , in this section we present another description of a thorny sphere by mapping it onto a round sphere with cuts .",
    "this approach allows us to formulate the constraint equation in an _ explicit _ algebraic form .",
    "there are several ways to do this .",
    "we describe here two simple methods",
    ".      0    one method of representing the thorny sphere , @xmath119 , with @xmath120 conical singularities @xmath121 , @xmath122 , is the following , applicable for @xmath123 : let the singularities be labeled so that the sequence of the shortest geodesic from @xmath124 to @xmath125 ( say geodesic segment @xmath36 with beginning at @xmath124 and end at @xmath125 ) , that from @xmath125 to @xmath126 ( say @xmath37 ) ,  , that from @xmath127 to @xmath128 ( say @xmath129 ) , and that from @xmath128 to @xmath124 ( say @xmath130 ) forms a closed path @xmath131 that does not intersect itself .",
    "for example , one can choose some regular point , find the shortest geodesic from that point to each conical singularity , arbitrarily choose one of the singular points to be @xmath124 , and then label the remaining conical singularities in the same order as the angles , at the regular point , of the tangent vectors of these geodesics from the regular point to those singularities .",
    "it is not obvious whether or not the resulting sequence of geodesics between the conical singularities chosen in this order ( or in any other possible specification of the order ) will necessarily form a closed path @xmath131 that does not intersect itself , but here we shall assume that it does .",
    "now the closed path @xmath132 divides the thorny sphere , @xmath119 , into two parts , say @xmath133 , which is encircled clockwise by @xmath132 , and @xmath134 , which is encircled counterclockwise by @xmath132 .",
    "because the interiors of both contains no conical singularities , they can be isometrically mapped to corresponding regions , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , on the round unit @xmath0 of the same unit curvature as the part of the thorny sphere @xmath119 away from the conical singularities .",
    "the boundaries of these two regions on @xmath0 are the geodesic polygons that are the images @xmath137 and @xmath138 of @xmath131 in these maps from the thorny sphere @xmath119 into the round sphere @xmath0 . in the simplest case of three conical singularities",
    "the regions @xmath139 and @xmath140 are spherical triangles .",
    "their map on the sphere is shown on fig .",
    "[ orange_2 ] .",
    "the two maps preserve the lengths of the geodesic edges @xmath100 of the polygon , and they preserve the angles @xmath141 and @xmath142 between the two successive geodesics that meet at the conical singularity @xmath121 . let us define @xmath141 to be the angle between the tangent vector of the geodesic ending at @xmath121 and that of the geodesic beginning at @xmath121 , measured in the region @xmath133 and taken to be positive if clockwise , so that the interior angle at that vertex of the polygon is @xmath143 .",
    "similarly , define @xmath142 to be the angle between that the geodesic ending at @xmath121 and that of the geodesic beginning at @xmath121 , measured in the region @xmath134 and also taken to be positive if clockwise , so that the interior angle at that vertex of the polygon is @xmath144 ( now with a plus sign since with the ordering given for the geodesic edges , the polygon encircles @xmath134 in the counterclockwise orientation rather than in the clockwise orientation as it does @xmath133 ) .",
    "then the conical deficit angle at @xmath121 is @xmath145 .",
    "the maps from @xmath133 on the thorny sphere @xmath119 to @xmath135 on the round sphere @xmath0 , and from @xmath134 on @xmath119 to @xmath136 on @xmath0 , give points @xmath146 on @xmath0 that are the vertices of @xmath135 , and points @xmath147 on @xmath0 that are the vertices of @xmath136 .",
    "then the locations of the @xmath89 points @xmath146 and @xmath147 on the round sphere @xmath0 uniquely determine the geometry of the thorny sphere @xmath119 , since they determine the polygon boundaries @xmath137 and @xmath138 of the regions @xmath135 and @xmath136 whose interiors have the unit - curvature metric inherited from the unit sphere @xmath0 . because the boundary segments are geodesics , the successive ones from @xmath135 and @xmath136",
    "can be identified so that the union of the two regions with this identification forms the thorny sphere @xmath119 with no singularities except for the conical singularities with deficit angles @xmath14 at the @xmath16 vertices .",
    "@xmath148    let us see how we get the right parameter count from this construction .",
    "navely one has two parameters for locating each of the @xmath89 points @xmath146 and @xmath147 on the round sphere @xmath0 , or @xmath149 total . however , there is the constraint that the geodesics segments from the successive @xmath146 s must match those from the successive @xmath147 s , which gives @xmath16 constraints , leaving only @xmath150 parameters arbitrary",
    ". then there is an arbitrary 3-parameter rotation that one can separately apply to both @xmath135 and @xmath136 , so of the @xmath150 arbitrary parameters , only @xmath92 are physically significant in determining the geometry of @xmath119 .",
    "this is precisely equal to the number of continuous parameters of a thorny sphere with @xmath16 conical singularities of arbitrary strength , the number of edge lengths @xmath26 of a triangulation of it , as discussed above ( under the assumption that the triangulation exists , though the number of continuous parameters would not be expected to depend on this assumption ) .",
    "given the location of @xmath135 on the round sphere @xmath0 ( which has three euler - angle parameters of arbitrariness ) , one could fix the three arbitrary rotation angles for the location of @xmath136 on the @xmath0 so that two successive vertices of @xmath135 ( say @xmath151 and @xmath152 in order to refer to them explicitly below ) coincide with the corresponding ones of @xmath136 ( i.e. , @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively ) , with these two regions being on opposite sides of the geodesic segment @xmath130 joining these two successive vertices and providing the common boundary between @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the union of these two regions with their common boundary , @xmath130 , no longer a boundary , then gives one single simply - connected region on the round @xmath0 that represents the thorny sphere @xmath119 .",
    "we will denote this union region as @xmath155 , and its boundary as @xmath78 .",
    "note , however , it is not ensured that the two regions that have been joined , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , will not overlap somewhere other than where they have been joined , so the map from @xmath119 to its image in @xmath0 is not necessarily one - to - one but can in some regions be two - to - one , and in general @xmath78 may have self - intersections .    in fig .",

    "if the @xmath264 are specified for all @xmath369 , and if the deficit angles @xmath217 and @xmath220 are also specified ( so that @xmath370 and @xmath371 are specified ) , then we define @xmath312 by @xmath372 and solve for the angles between @xmath310 , @xmath311 , and @xmath312 .",
    "this determines @xmath310 and @xmath311 up to an overall rotation about the vector @xmath312 .",
    "if all of the deficit angles are specified , and all but two non - consecutive positions , then one has to permute the positions and put in the appropriate commutators to solve for those positions ( up to the arbitrary rotation ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath347 , suppose that the deficit angles but not the positions of the 1st and 3rd points are specified , and that both are specified for the 2nd and 4th points , so that @xmath373 and @xmath368 are given .",
    "then if we define @xmath374 , the constraint equation becomes @xmath375 , and one can use the previous procedure to solve for @xmath376 and @xmath377 , up to an overall rotation about the axis of the rotation @xmath378 . finally , one reconstructs @xmath379 .",
    "this procedure has a straightforward generalization for all higher @xmath16 and for the unspecified positions to be further separated in the cyclic chain of rotations @xmath264 that combine to produce the identity .",
    "0    using method @xmath42 developed in section 3 one gets a map @xmath380 of a thorny sphere @xmath119 onto a pair of simply connected regions on a unit round sphere .",
    "the boundaries @xmath381 and @xmath382 are isometric spherical polygons which are to be identified .",
    "each of the polygons has @xmath16 vertices , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , where @xmath16 is a number of the conical singularities of the thorny sphere @xmath119 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the change of the reference point which is used to order the conical singularities may result in the change of order of vertices @xmath146 and @xmath147 , and as a result of this , one can get different choice of regions @xmath383 representing the same thorny sphere .",
    "it is evident that the corresponding maps @xmath384 and @xmath385 formally being different , are in fact equivalent .",
    "when we construct regions @xmath135 and @xmath136 using the method described in section 4.1 by solving the constraint equations we do not know in advance which ordering procedure of the conical singularities on the thorny sphere would correspond to the set of vertices obtained by gluing the boundaries @xmath137 and @xmath386 and identifying the vertices @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "in fact , the situation is even more complicated .",
    "let us note that the constraint equations ( [ n10 ] ) and ( [ b ] ) remain unchanged if one includes a unit operator between any two subsequent terms , say @xmath260 and @xmath387 in the product of matrices .",
    "but a rotation along an axis @xmath52 by the angle @xmath388 is represented by a unit operator . thus adding two new vertices with angle deficits @xmath388 ( one for each of the regions @xmath389 ) does not violate the constraint equations .",
    "we can choose the new angle deficits to be negative and put the new vertices at the north and south poles of a round sphere .",
    "this is equivalent to the usage of a covering space @xmath390 for a round sphere with a winding number @xmath391 .",
    "that is why by solving the constraint equations ( [ n10 ] ) and ( [ b ] ) one may end not with regular regions @xmath383 on a round sphere , but with regions on a covering space for @xmath390 . after identifying the points of @xmath275 different leaves and projecting @xmath390 onto @xmath0 ,",
    "one obtains boundaries @xmath137 and @xmath138 which are topologically circles @xmath392 , but which have intersections .    in order to exclude such cases",
    "one must be certain that after a solution of the constraint equations one does not have undesirable extra vertices with @xmath393 angle deficits .",
    "we describe now a procedure which allows one to do this .",
    "consider a map @xmath394 of the region @xmath395 onto the region @xmath396 of the thorny sphere @xmath397 under this map the boundary @xmath398 of @xmath399 is transformed into the boundary @xmath400 of @xmath401 .",

    "@xmath394 is determined as @xmath411    one can prove ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the index of the map does not depend on the choice of the regular point @xmath402 and is invariant under smooth homotopies .",
    "moreover , the index of the map @xmath394 is the same as the index of the map @xmath394 restricted to the boundary @xmath412 . since both of the boundaries are topologically circles @xmath392 , the degree of this map is just a winding number @xmath275 .",
    "note that @xmath135 and @xmath136 have the same degree of map because @xmath138 can be obtained by a deformation of @xmath137 ( recall that we got vertices on @xmath138 by rotating vertices on @xmath137 ) .    to calculate this winding number we consider a stereographic projection of @xmath398 into a plane .",
    "we take the origin of the stereographic projection to lie in the interior of the region @xmath135 . for a resulting curve @xmath413 with intersections",
    "we define @xmath414 where @xmath20 is the gaussian curvature of the curve @xmath413 and @xmath415 is the proper distance element . since @xmath275 is invariant under smooth homotopic transformations , it remains the same under a continuous change of the position of the ` north ' pole used for the stereographic projection until it cross @xmath398 .    to summarize the above discussion we stress that using method @xmath42 , starting with a given thorny sphere @xmath119 one can define ( not uniquely ) regions @xmath416 and the gluing procedure which recovers @xmath119 . in the inverse procedure ,",
    "when one starts with a solution of the constraint equations , one must first check whether the winding number of the boundary is 1 . only in this case",
    "will the gluing procedure give a thorny sphere @xmath119 without any additional angle deficits that are negative integer multiples of @xmath44 .",
    "0      for example , if we define @xmath436 to give a rescaled thorny sphere with area @xmath17 and smooth part having gaussian curvature no longer unity but @xmath437 then the reissner - nordstrom black hole generalizes to the following solution with strings : @xmath438 here @xmath81 is precisely the charge , defined as @xmath439 times the flux of electric field through each thorny sphere .",
    "this form of the reissner - nordstrom metric remains valid ( but is no longer asymptotically flat with a static timelike killing vector @xmath440 ) when the rescaled thorny sphere with positive gaussian curvature , @xmath441 , on its smooth part , is replaced by a rescaled _ thorny pseudosphere _ with negative gaussian curvature , @xmath442 , on its smooth part that is then locally isometric to a hyperbolic 2-space with constant negative curvature .",
