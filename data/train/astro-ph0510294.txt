    ", this small dispersion indicates that the mips 24@xmath1 m absolute calibration is actually accurate to @xmath29 . this uncertainty estimate is consistent with 24@xmath1 m measurements of 69 f5-k5 ( iv & v ) stars observed by the mips gto science team ( beichman et al . 2005a ; bryden et al .",

    "we conclude that the photometric calibration of our mips 24@xmath1 m photometry relative to the best fit kurucz models is 5 - 6% .",
    "since we do not detect the photospheres at 70 and 160@xmath1 m , we can not independently derive uncertainties relative to kurucz models .",
    "therefore we adopt the ssc - published 20% absolute uncertainty for both the mips 70 and 160@xmath1 m photometry .",
    "finally , we calculate a total uncertainty in the physical flux density for each photometric measurement by adding the `` internal '' and calibration uncertainties in quadrature .",
    "low - resolution ( r = 70 - 120 ) spectra were obtained on ut 2004 july 13 with the infrared spectrograph ( irs : houck et al .",
    "we used an irs high - accuracy , blue peak - up ( 1@xmath6 uncertainty radius = 0.4 ) to acquire the star in the spectrograph slit , thus minimizing slit losses and assuring high photometric accuracy .",
    "two nod positions per cycle were obtained in standard staring mode with one cycle for the short - low wavelength range ( 7.4 - 14.5 @xmath1 m ) , and 3 cycles for each of the two long - low wavelength ranges ( 14.0  21.3@xmath1 m and 19.5  38.0@xmath1 m ) .",

    "the spatially unresolved spectra were extracted using a 6.2 pixel fixed - width aperture in the spatial dimension for the first order of the short wavelength low - resolution module , and 5.1 and 3.1 pixels for the first and second order of the long wavelength low - resolution module , respectively .",
    "the spectra were calibrated using a spectral response function derived from irs spectra and kurucz stellar models for a set of 16 stars observed within the feps program that exhibit : 1 ) high signal - to - noise observations , 2 ) no residual instrumental artifacts , and 3 ) no signs of infrared excess .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was tied to calibrator stars observed by the irs instrument team , but reduced as for the rest of the feps sample and referenced to calibrated stellar models provided by the ssc ( see also hines et al . 2004a , 2005 ; bouwman et al .",
    "2005 ) . using this internally consistent approach enables us to improve the absolute flux calibration and reduces the noise on the adopted relative spectral response functions .",

    "the 64 images obtained at each of the four dither positions provided a total of 256 images of each star for a total integration time of 2.56 seconds in each channel .",
    "all photometry was performed on the basic calibrated data products from the ssc s10.5.0 data pipeline as described in the som4.6 and the pipeline description document available through the ssc .",
    "aperture photometry was performed using idp3 with a 36 radius aperture centered on the target , and the background was estimated by the median of the pixels in a 122  39  radius annulus centered on the source in each sub - array image .",
    "this annulus circumscribes the 32x32 array and thus uses all pixels outside of a 10-pixel radius from the target .",
    "the background flux was normalized to the area of the target aperture and subtracted from the summed target aperture flux .",
    "the reported source flux is the mean of the 256 measures , corrected from a 36 radius to the calibration aperture using values published in table 5.7 of the infrared array camera data handbook v1.0 .",
    "the `` internal '' uncertainties are estimated from the standard deviation of the 256 measurements , and are typically @xmath341%",

    "this suggests that there are residual systematic offsets in the absolute calibration of the irac sub - array mode .",
    "these are probably caused by gradients in the filter band - passes across the detector ( quijada et al .",

    ", we used our most accurately calibrated irac band and the 2mass @xmath39-band , which is least affected by extinction .",
    "in addition , since only three of the stars lie outside of the dust - free local bubble ( @xmath40 pc ) , and all are within 150 pc , we do not expect extinction in the @xmath39-band to cause us to identify spurious 24@xmath1 m excesses .",
    "these ratios are independent of model atmosphere fits to the individual stars , and will identify excess candidates regardless of any relative calibration offsets between the instruments .",

    "the 30 myr old , g3/5v star hd  12039 is clearly distinguished in figures 1 & 2 , and apparently has significant excess emission at 24@xmath1 m detected in both irs and mips independently relative to the other 32 stars .    since the mips and irs data for each object were obtained @xmath41 days apart , the agreement between the flux density measurements for hd  12039 rules out a chance superposition of an asteroid in one of the observations as the explanation for the excess .",
    "furthermore , inspection of 2mass images shows that there are no other objects having @xmath42 mag within 5  of the position of this star , and the 24@xmath1 m image is indistinguishable from a single , isolated point source .",
    "therefore the measured 24@xmath1 m emission is associated directly with hd  12039 .",
    "the excess in the f@xmath38(24@xmath1m)/f@xmath38(ks ) ratios are observed at the 4.2 and 4.3@xmath6 level relative to the median ratios for the other 32 stars from the mips 24@xmath1 m and irs 24@xmath1 m photometry ( figs . 1 & 2 ) . the probability of drawing this @xmath43 result from a gaussian distribution of data for these 33 targets is @xmath44 .",
    "as a further check on the reality of this excess at 24@xmath1 m , we compared the distributions of of the ratios our measured mips and irs 24@xmath1 m flux densities to the flux densities predicted by kurucz model atmospheres fit to optical and near - ir photometry for all 33 stars ( figure 3 ) . excluding hd  12039 , the median and standard deviations ( @xmath45 ) of these distributions are 0.98 @xmath16 0.05 and 0.99 @xmath16 0.06 for mips 24@xmath1 m and irs 24@xmath1 m respectively , suggesting that the mips and irs absolute flux calibrations are accurate to 5 - 6% relative to the best fit kurucz models .",
    "the ratio of measured - to - kurucz model 24@xmath1 m flux densities obtained with both instruments for hd  12309 is 1.33@xmath35 , and [ f@xmath46 m ) - f@xmath47m)]/@xmath6 is 5.4 and 5.3 for mips and irs , respectively , where @xmath6 is the @xmath48 of the standard deviation of the distributions in figure 3 and the total measurement uncertainty for hd  12039 .",
    "based upon the above analysis , we conclude that hd  12039 has excess emission above its stellar photosphere at 24@xmath1 m .",
    "figure 4 shows the irac and mips photometry plus the irs low resolution spectrum of hd  12039 compared to the model photosphere .",
    "the object was not detected at 70@xmath1 m with a 3@xmath6 upper limit that is 6 times the expected photospheric flux .",
    "upper limits are also shown for 160@xmath1 m , 1.2 mm , and 3.1 mm .",
    "the photospheric emission component of the spectrum in figure 4 was fit with kurucz model atmospheres ( including convective overshoot ) to the optical and near - infrared photometry .",

    "( 2003 and references therein ) using the combined system response of detector , filter and atmosphere ( for ground - based observations ) .",
    "the best - fit model was computed in a least squares sense with the effective temperature and angular diameter of the star as free parameters , [ fe / h ] fixed to solar metallicity , surface gravity fixed to the value appropriate for the adopted stellar age and mass ( log  g  =  4 in this case ) , and visual extinction fixed to 0 mag within the dust - free local bubble ( d@xmath49 pc ) .",
    "the derived best - fit stellar model has t@xmath50",
    "= 5688k , consistent with hd  12039 s catalog g3/5v spectral type .    in comparing _",
    "data to the model photosphere we have adopted the weighted average wavelengths that correspond to the monochromatic flux density within the filter band - passes according to the som4.6 .",
    "also , for the purposes of plotting the data , a color correction ( @xmath51 ) has been applied to the mips 24@xmath1 m point assuming a color temperature @xmath52k estimated from the slope of the irs spectrum from 24@xmath1 m to 33@xmath1 m ( see below ) .",
    "the irac and short wavelength irs data for hd  12039 are consistent with the best - fit kurucz model .",
    "however , the irs spectrum begins to depart from the photosphere between 12 - 14@xmath1 m , passes through the mips 24@xmath1 m datum , and continues to increase until at least 33@xmath1 m .",
    "this is shown more clearly in the bottom panel of figure 4 , where we have plotted the ratio of the measured flux densities to the model - predicted flux densities .",
    "we also show the synthetic 33@xmath1 m photometric point from the irs spectrum , which lies @xmath53 above the kurucz model .",
    "the lack of significant excess continuum emission for wavelengths @xmath54 m and the measured 24@xmath1 m excess together imply a maximum color temperature of @xmath55k .",
    "the slope and uncertainty between the mips 24@xmath1 m and irs 33@xmath1 m broadband photometric points correspond to color temperatures @xmath56k , @xmath5k .",
    "the 70@xmath1 m upper limit constrains the @xmath57 m color temperature to @xmath58k . in the next section",
    "we further characterize the infrared excess , and explore circumstellar disk models .",
    "we also consider constraints on the nature of the thermally emitting material imposed by timescales for evolution of dust in the system .",
    "to further characterize the infrared excess , we assume that the emission originates from large grains that absorb and emit radiation efficiently at all relevant wavelengths ; that is , we treat the grains as blackbodies ( e.g. , aumann et al .",
    "1984 ; walker & wolstencroft 1988 ; backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "blackbody emission at wavelengths as long as @xmath59 m requires grain radii larger than @xmath60 m , and for such grains the dust physical temperature t@xmath61 is the same as the color temperature .    given the fitted color temperature of t @xmath5k and assuming blackbody grains in thermal equilibrium with the stellar radiation field , we calculate a typical grain location of 6 au from the star .",
    "we also derive an upper limit to the grain radial distance by considering the 3@xmath6 upper limit to the 70@xmath1 m flux density ( figs . 3 & 4 ) . only blackbody grain models with r@xmath62au do not violate this constraint .",
    "thus , the observed infrared excess spectrum for hd  12039 is consistent with a fairly narrow range of dust temperatures and radial annuli .",
    "we note that although the ir emission from hd  12039 may be dominated by such relatively large grains , the characteristic emission temperature of 110k is low enough that the lack of solid state emission features at e.g.  10 and 18@xmath1 m from the bending and stretching modes of standard astronomical silicates does not exclude the presence of smaller grains .",
    "the observed excess at 24@xmath1 m and limit at @xmath63 m excludes the presence of material at t @xmath64k with more than @xmath65 the surface density inferred for the material near 110k , assuming that any material at higher temperatures and smaller radii from the star would have a surface density @xmath66 as for poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag .",
    "similarly , the @xmath67 m limit excludes material at t@xmath68k with more than @xmath69 the total grain cross - sectional area of material at 110k .",
    "the fractional infrared luminosity of the excess across the wavelength range 2470@xmath1 m is f @xmath70 l@xmath2/l@xmath3 .",
    "we further investigate the hd  12039 debris system using the dust disk models of wolf & hillenbrand ( 2003 ) , which take into account absorption and emission from dust grains based on their optical properties as opposed to the simple blackbody assumption .",
    "in particular , we use `` astronomical silicates '' ( draine & lee 1984 ; laor & draine 1993 ; weingartner & draine 2001 ) .",
    "we assume a volume density profile that corresponds to a disk with constant mass surface density , consistent with but not requiring dynamic control by p - r drag (  5.3 ) .",
    "as discussed above , the wavelength at which the dust re - emission departs significantly from the stellar photosphere ( @xmath71 m ) yields an initial estimate of the inner radius of the disk @xmath72 .",
    "this is also the location of the warmest material , but the dust temperature of t@xmath5k is too low to produce detectable silicate emission features ( see , e.g. , fig . 10 in wolf & hillenbrand ( 2003 ) and their discussion of the effects of inner holes , thus maximum temperatures , on the predicted spectra of debris disks ) .    to explain the spectrum of the infrared excess in hd  12039",
    ", we calculated the inner and outer disk radii and corresponding total dust mass for a suite of single - size - grain models with particle radii @xmath73 and 100@xmath1 m .",
    "we applied the levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( marquardt 1963 ; markwardt 2003 ) to find the models that best fit the observations of hd  12039 in a chi  squared sense ( rodmann et al . in prep ) .",
    "the parameters of these models are presented in table 2 and illustrated graphically in figure 5 .",
    "models assuming small grains require large orbital radii from the star ( @xmath74 10 - 40 au , @xmath75 20 - 50 au ) , because these small grains have low radiative efficiencies compared with blackbody grains . for grain sizes @xmath76 m",
    ", we find values of and , approximately independent of particle size , consistent with the simple blackbody dust model .",
    "table 2 and figure 5 also show that a model assuming @xmath77 m grains ( located between 4 - 6au ) yields the minimum dust mass .",
    "these single - size - grain models illustrate the inherent degeneracies in fitting spectral data alone without independent morphological information such as direct imaging of the systems in thermal emission or scattered light .    real systems in which the dust is produced by collisions of parent bodies",

    "therefore , we also modeled the infrared excess for hd  12039 using a power - law grain size distribution that included small grains of radius ( just smaller than the blowout size , see below ) and a maximum grain size of ( just larger than can efficiently radiate at _ spitzer _ wavelengths ) .",
    "the power - law exponent was set to @xmath78 , which is produced by a collisional cascade .",
    "for such a distribution , most of the opacity is supplied by the smallest grains and most of the mass in is contained in the largest grains .",
    "for these assumptions the best - fit inner and outer disk radii are and , respectively ( table 2 ) .",
    "in general , more mass is required by this model than by the single - size - grain models considered above because of the inclusion of very large grains with small ratios of emitting area to mass .",
    "disk models and the photosphere - subtracted _ spitzer _ data for hd  12039 are shown in figure 6 .",
    "all of the models require an inner hole radius @xmath79au , but we are unable to choose between the various models from the spectral fitting alone .",
    "we therefore consider , in the next section , physical scenarios for dust production and migration that lead us to a preferred model .",
    "we further constrain properties of the dust debris system around hd  12039 by considering the interaction between dust grains and radiation from the star ( e.g. , burns et al .",
    "1979 ; backman & paresce 1993 ; wyatt et al . 1999 , and references therein ; th ' ebault et al .",
    "assuming there is no remnant gas in the system , typical astrophysical silicates with radius @xmath80 m and density @xmath81 = 2.5 g @xmath82 produced by parent bodies in circular orbits at any distance surrounding a star with the luminosity and mass of hd  12039 will be expelled by radiation pressure .",
    "when grains travel a factor of four farther from the star than from where they originated , their equilibrium temperature falls by a factor of two and they are no longer important contributors to the observed infrared emission .",
    "the relevant timescales for this movement are @xmath83yrs and @xmath84yrs for grains starting at 6au and 30au respectively .",
    "ice grains ( @xmath85 g @xmath82 ) , assumed to be  dirty \" with albedos similar to silicates , will be similarly removed if @xmath86 m .",
    "therefore , the presence of grains smaller than the blowout size would signal a very recent collisional event .",
    "in addition to radiation pressure expelling small grains from the system , p - r drag will cause inward migration of particles in the absence of remnant circumstellar gas .",
    "the time scales for silicate grains ( @xmath81 = 2.5 g @xmath82 ) to spiral into the star from a release radius @xmath87au are @xmath88 or @xmath89 yr for grains with @xmath90 m ( a bit above the blow - out size ) or @xmath60 m ( the minimum blackbody emitter size ) , respectively .",
    "this is much longer than the blow - out time ( @xmath91 years ) , but still short compared to the @xmath92 myr age of the system .",
    "similar sized grains at 30 - 40au would have p - r timescales @xmath93 myr , again shorter than the system age .",
    "in either distance regime , small particles are removed on sufficiently short timescales that the material must be replenished if we are witnessing a steady - state . alternatively , as mentioned above , the dust could have been produced by a relatively recent event .    the dust fractional surface density ( m@xmath94 cross - section per m@xmath94 of disk ) near the minimum orbital radius @xmath95 is numerically roughly equal to the fractional luminosity in the excess f = @xmath96 ( backman 2004 ) , i.e.  f@xmath97 . from this",
    "we can explore the relative importance of p - r drag compared with grain evolution caused by mutual collisions ( e.g. , wyatt et al .",
    "1999 ; wyatt & dent 2002 ; wyatt 2005 ) .",
    "considering our two primary disk models discussed above , the dust mutual collision timescales in this system are approximately @xmath98 yr for 7@xmath1 m grains at @xmath99au , and @xmath100 yr for 0.5@xmath1 m grains at @xmath101au with scaling as @xmath102 ( backman & paresce 1993 ) . at 30au ,",
    "the collision and p - r timescales are comparable , so material moves towards the star from its region of origin before collisions can modify it significantly . at 6au",
    "the collision timescale is 25 times smaller than the p - r timescale , so collisions can grind material down to the blowout size before the larger grains migrate towards the star via p - r drag .",
    "this creates a natural paucity of material inside the inner radius of the parent body orbits , and could explain the observed lack of significant material at hotter temperatures ( i.e. , smaller orbital radii ) .",
    "this mechanism for keeping inner holes clear may operate in other well studied disks ( e.g. , wilner et al . 2002 ; dominik & decin 2003 ; wyatt 2005 ) .    in this analysis we have not considered corpuscular drag from collisions with the stellar wind from hd  12039 , which would increase the minimum grain blowout size . even for young sun - like stars , corpuscular drag forces",
    "are thought to be small compared with radiation forces ( f@xmath103/f@xmath104 : gustafson 1994 ) .",
    "very tiny grains ( e.g. , @xmath105 m for silicates ) would be inefficient absorbers at the peak wavelengths of the stellar spectrum and perhaps stable against radiation blowout , but possibly vulnerable to ionization and resulting magnetic forces in ways that are poorly understood .",
    "we can assume that silicate grains with radii at least over the range @xmath106 m ( or dirty ice grains with @xmath107 m ) are unstable against ejection from this system .",
    "our inferred properties of the debris associated with hd  12039 assume that dust dynamics are dominated by interactions with the stellar radiation field and are _ not _ determined by dust ",
    "gas dynamics .",
    "this requires the gas  to  dust ratio to be @xmath108 0.1 ( e.g. , takeuchi & artymowicz 2001 ; klahr & lin 2001 ) . while this is consistent with the known properties of hd  12039 ( no signatures of active accretion in the stellar spectrum , no strong mid ",
    "ir atomic or molecular emission ",
    "line features ) , detailed searches for remnant gas have not been made . with this caveat , the short grain evolution timescales relative to the system age imply that the dusty debris consists primarily of second - generation grains released by collisions and/or sublimation of larger parent bodies .",
    "we have presented a range of possible models that successfully fit the thermal excess , but two are of particular interest because they represent end points of a plausible range of grain physical characteristics : ( 1 ) large  blackbody \" grains ( @xmath76 m ) located between 4 and 6 au from the star , and ( 2 ) grains with sizes @xmath109 m characterized by a powerlaw distribution , and located between 28 and 40 au . without resolved images of the debris system or more sensitive searches for mineralogical features , we can not distinguish between these models with confidence .",
    "however , the surface area in model ( 2 ) with the wide belt and a grain size distribution that is dominated by grains near the blowout size would require either : a ) a large mass ( @xmath110 m@xmath111 ) of parent bodies in collisional equilibrium to maintain the small - grain population against rapid blowout and p - r drift ; or b ) the discovery of a large transient dust signature observable only for a few hundred years and due to recent collisional event .    based on planetesimal accretion code models of a minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) surrounding a sun - like star , kenyon & bromley ( 2004 , 2005 ) have shown that the growth of planetesimals in the terrestrial zone can produce @xmath112 and @xmath113 mag infrared excesses at 10@xmath1 m and 24@xmath1 m respectively .",
    "the peak emission occurs from @xmath114 to @xmath115yrs when the largest planetesimals have reached @xmath116 km in size . by 10@xmath117 yrs ,",
    "the excess is nearly gone at 10@xmath1 m , but persists at 24@xmath1 m until @xmath118 yrs .",
    "importantly , even though the overall dust production ( thus ir emission ) declines , individual collisions between 10 - 100 km bodies will produce short - lived @xmath119 mag signatures ( see fig . 3 in kenyon & bromley 2004 ; kenyon & bromley 2005 ) . the observed @xmath120 mag excess at 24@xmath1 m in hd  12039 is roughly consistent with this scenario .",
    "in contrast , at it is harder to grow large bodies at farther distances from the star .",
    "collisions at 30 au are predicted not to be massive enough in general to produce an observable excess above the photosphere at 24@xmath1 m ( kenyon & bromley 2005 ) .",
    "these considerations suggest that our model ( 1 ) is the most plausible explanation for the infrared excess in hd  12039 .",
    "the lack of material much warmer than @xmath5k in the hd  12039 system could be explained by several mechanisms .",
    "first , this temperature is approximately equal to the threshold for the onset of rapid sublimation of micron - sized water ice grains .",
    "thus , if the dust parent bodies are primarily icy , the inner edge of the observed debris distribution could be determined by grain evaporation .",
    "second , as discussed in  5.3 , the timescale on which grains collide and produce fragments small enough for rapid blowout is an order of magnitude shorter than the p - r timescale at 6 au , but the timescales are comparable at 30 au .",
    "this suggests that the inner belt model could be self - limited .",
    "dust grains would collide ` in situ ' before drifting inward a significant distance from their production location ( wyatt 2005 ) , and the small grains would be blown out by radiation pressure .",
    "the existence of a planetesimal belt surrounding hd  12039 might require the presence of a nearby giant planet to stop the planet formation process , as is understood to be the case with jupiter and the asteroid belt in our solar system .",
    "third , a planet could exist at the inner edge of the debris annulus and consume / scatter inbound grains ( e.g. , moro - martn , wolf & malhotra 2005 ) .    at the distance of hd  12039 , and with l@xmath2/l@xmath121 in the range of objects detected previously in scattered light with _",

    "hst _ , if it is composed of small grains at 30au .",
    "a null detection would strengthen the case that the material is concentrated in a belt at 4 - 6au .",
    "nicmos ( and ground - based ao ) imaging should also place limits on the presence of a planet perturber that may be responsible for stirring up the debris .",
