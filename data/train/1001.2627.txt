    "it is important to obtain the mass of galaxies for understanding the evolution of the universe .",
    "we know that the dark matter halo contains most of mass , and can only be detected using the effect of gravitation .",
    "so generally , the total mass of galaxies could only be computed on the basis of kinematics of bright stars , clusters , or even satellite galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , due to the restriction from lower resolution and lower sensibility of telescopes for detecting the motion of celestial bodies in high redshift galaxies , these methods are just used for deriving general properties of nearby galaxies .",
    "though the fraction of baryonic components in galaxies is relatively small , it could be detected and studied easily . except the gas",
    "dominant galaxies , stars hold most of baryonic components in galaxies . thus , to understand the correlation between the stellar mass and total mass is essential for studying the faint and distant galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to seek some methods to estimate the stellar mass in galaxies .",
    "if we know the mass - to - luminosity ratio of a galaxy , and assume an initial mass function ( imf ) , its stellar mass could also be estimated from the luminosity in corresponding wavelength ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "traditionally , mass - to - luminosity ratios could be derived by fitting photometric colors or spectra with models .",
    "most of baryonic components are trapped in low mass stars , which dominate the output of galaxies in longer wavelength range compared to the massive ones . at the same time , the short life scale of massive stars and heavy extinction in relatively short wavelength ranges restrict us to use them to detect the bulk of galactic stellar masses .",
    "hence , less affected by other factors , such as metallicity , star formation rate ( sfr ) and star formation history ( sfh ) , luminosities in relatively longer wavelength ( for example , near - infrared ( nir ) band ) , are ideal tracers of the stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath2 band luminosity distribution of distant galaxies was discussed in support of the hierarchical picture by @xcite .",
    "the main uncertainty in the inferred stellar masses arises from the age of the stellar population @xcite , similar to the results calculated by optical luminosities @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy among stellar masses derived from various methods has been found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the uncertainty of the stellar mass estimated by @xmath2-band luminosity alone has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared many estimation methods for local galaxies and also showed the differences ( the factors up to  2 ) among them .    except for above methods",
    ", the stellar mass could also be directly calculated using mid - infrared ( mir ) luminosities in 3 - 5@xmath1 m , since emissions from the photosphere of old stars dominate the output of galaxies in this wavelength range . at the same time , the extinction and reddening in this range are clearly weak . but using these emissions to study the universe was prevented because of the absorption of atmosphere until the onset of space infrared observations .",
    "@xmath3 @xcite is a very useful facility to help us to study the mir to far - infrared ( fir ) emission properties of galaxies .",
    "the two detectors in the shorter wavelength bands ( 3.6@xmath1 m and 4.5@xmath1 m ) of @xmath0 infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",

    "the derived data from sdss dr7 , including the stellar mass , was supplied by the max - planck - institute for astrophysics ( @xmath13 ) and the johns hopkins university ( @xmath14 ) in their archives . compared with former data releases , such as dr4 , some galaxies were excluded in dr7 due to new restricts on the detected sources before publication by @xmath13/@xmath14 .",
    "the stellar mass derived from fitting photometries with population synthesis models was treated as reference .",
    "the foreground extinction in all the five sdss bands were corrected by subtracting the extinction values presented in the sdss catalog .",

    "the basic sample contains @xmath16 objects .",
    "for all these sources , a set of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) @xcite was used to perform k - correction in irac 3.6@xmath1 m and 4.5@xmath1 m bands .",
    "only part of the galaxies ( total is 659 ) have been mapped by @xmath17 .",
    "the extended source catalog ( @xmath18 ) was download from the archives of infrared processing and analysis center [ @xmath19 and matched with the above sample with a cross radius of 2@xmath15 .",

    "ab magnitude is 1.84 @xcite . and a factor of 5.12 @xcitewas used as the @xmath2@xmath20 band solar absolute magnitude .",
    "for all the 1454 galaxies , 68 with positive h@xmath21 equivalent width were classified as absorption line galaxies , while the rest 1386 were classified as emission line galaxies .",
    "futhermore , emission line galaxies with detected h@xmath21 , h@xmath22 , [ oiii ] , [ nii ] emission lines were selected , and optical spectral classifications were carried out on these @xmath23 galaxies , adopting the traditional bpt diagnostic diagram : [ nii]/h@xmath21 versus [ oiii]/h@xmath22 @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the dashed curve is from @xcite and the dotted curve is from @xcite .",
    "objects located below the dashed curve were classified as star - forming galaxies ; those between these two lines were classified as composite ( starburst @xmath24 agn ) galaxies @xcite ; while those above the dotted line were classified as narrow - line agns .",

    "@xcite presented an equation to compute @xmath27 to represent agn activities , defined as the distance of an agn from its position ( @xmath28,@xmath29 ) in dex in the traditionally line - diagnostic diagram [ oiii]/h@xmath30 versus [ nii]/h@xmath31 to the @xcite s curve along the parallel of the best linear fitting of 27 agns .",
    "this is quite similar to the star - forming distance defined by @xcite in the diagnostic diagram [ oiii]/h@xmath32 versus [ oi]/h@xmath31 or [ sii]/h@xmath31 . here",
    ", we also use this formula to quantify agn activities ( see the orange solid line in figure  [ fig1 ] as an example ) . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , the two dotted - dashed lines above the dotted curve marked the boundaries that were used by @xcite .",
    "only sources whose ew(h@xmath22 ) were less than -5 were selected by @xcite .",
    "but in this work , we did not use this limit to reduce those sources with smaller values of ew(h@xmath22 ) , such as liners .",
    "therefore , many agns appeared outside the right boundary in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) could dominate the output of galaxies at some evolutionary phases @xcite .",
    "but lots of evolutionary tracks used in stellar population synthesis models did not consider the effect from tp - agb .",
    "so there must exist bias for the derived stellar mass when comparing observations with those models .",
    "for example , for young template models ( with ages less than 2 gyr ) , both @xcite and @xcite have concluded that galactic stellar masses calculated with an improved treatment of tp - agb stars are roughly 50 to 60 per cent lower .",
    "hence , due to the lower effective surface temperature of tp - agb , referenced stellar mass derived from optical observations could avoid the emission of tp - agb .",
    "the referenced stellar mass used in this work was provided by @xmath13/@xmath14 in their archive .",
    "they derived stellar masses from fitting photometries @xcite and spectral features @xcite with a large grid of models from bc03 @xcite spanning a large range in sfh .",
    "the stellar mass derived using sdss photometries could avoid the aperture effect which should be considered when fitting spectral features , since only a part of region of the observed object was covered by sdss spectral fiber with 3@xmath15 diameter .",
    "for about eighteen thousand galaxies randomly selected from mpa sdss dr4 sample , the stellar masses derived from photometries and spectral indices fits were compared and shown in figure  [ fig2](a ) .",

    "this trend is more clear in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the disagreement is more obvious for lower stellar mass and bluer galaxies than higher stellar mass and redder ones , which is similar to the results supplied by of @xcite who found that large discrepancy existed between their reference stellar mass and the one derived from bell et al.s ( 2003 ) correlations , with factors in the range of 2 to 5 .",

    "most of the galaxies , especially for composites , agns and absorption line galaxies , have m@xmath35 brighter than @xmath3418 mag , which usually is regarded as the boundary to distinguish with dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "few galaxies have redshift larger than 0.15 .",
    "herce , most of the galaxies in our sample are local ones .",
    "the star - forming galaxies have lower stellar mass than the others in figure  [ fig4](c ) .",
    "the morphology of galaxies was represented by @xmath11 band concentration parameters ( @xmath3650/@xmath3690 ) , which defined as ratio of two radii containing 50% and 90% of the petrosian @xmath11 band luminosity .",

    ", we found that the morphologies of the composite galaxies , agns and absorption line galaxies are similar , but those of star - forming galaxies are later type .",

    "the effect of color excess e(b - v ) on the mass - to - luminosity ratios is illustrated in figure  [ fig5](c1 , c2 , c3 ) .",
    "e(b - v ) is for the intrinsic extinction and calculated from balmer decrement @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "thus only the emission line galaxies are plotted here . in figure",
    "[ fig5](d1 , d2 , d3 ) , the oxygen abundance is used to represent the metallicity of star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the oxygen abundances of ism were provided by @xcite , which computed the abundances by fitting serial spectral features from sdss observational spectra to models .",
    "the effect of agn activities is shown in figure  [ fig5](e1 , e2 , e3 ) by using @xmath27 to represent agn activities as like @xcite .",
    "only agns located in between the two boundaries defined by @xcite were adopted .",
    "we should note , except the concentration parameters , all above factors are derived from the spectral features in central regions covered by sdss fibers with 3@xmath15 diameter .",
    "for the correlations between m / l(3.6@xmath1 m ) and the five factors ( ew(h@xmath21 ) , @xmath3650/@xmath3690 , e(b - v ) , oxygen abundance , @xmath27 ) , the spearman rank - order correlation analysis coefficients are 0.74 , 0.58 , 0.15 , 0.45 and 0.01 , respectively ; while for the correlations between m / l(4.5@xmath1 m ) and the five factors ( bottom five panels in figure  [ fig5]),the spearman rank - order correlation analysis coefficients are 0.77 , 0.58 , 0.10 , 0.36 and 0.01 , respectively",
    ". hence , it is clear that the m / l(3.6@xmath1 m ) and m / l(4.5@xmath1 m ) are more sensitive to the ew(h@xmath21 ) , morphology and metallicity of galaxies .",

    "in order to derive the formulae to estimate stellar masses using these three band luminosities , we present the correlations between them and stellar masses for all the galaxies in our sample firstly . the @xmath2@xmath20 band , 3.6@xmath1 m and 4.5@xmath1 m bands luminosities are plotted against stellar masses in figure  [ fig6 ] .",

    "the shift could be due to fact that different stellar mass references ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) are used in these two works .    above analysis",
    "ignored the effect by different sfh .",
    "in fact , there is such effect , at least for star - forming galaxies illustrated in figure  [ fig5](a1 , a2 , a3 ) , which showed the correlations between the ew(h@xmath21 ) and mass - to - luminosity ratios of @xmath2@xmath20 band , 3.6@xmath1 m and 4.5@xmath1 m luminosities .",
    "the sfh could also be represented with the @xmath33-@xmath11 color indicated by both @xcite and @xcite , which was also proved an effective method to estimate the stellar mass by @xcite .",

    "the slope of our fit of m / l(@xmath11 ) vs. @xmath33-@xmath11 color is much deeper than that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found similar discrepancy .",
    "one possible explanation is that different evolutionary population synthesis models have been used to derive standard stellar mass .",

    "now , the progress of space astronomy make us capable to observe the mir sky directly .",
    "@xcite indicated that the dispersion of blue galaxies was diffused in the m / l(@xmath2@xmath20 ) vs. @xmath46-@xmath36 plane ( their figure 20 ) .",
    "and the fitting slope was shallower for red galaxies compared to the blue ones . using modified broad band johnson photometry correlation",

    "the one with number 1 is a dwarf star - forming galaxies , with low metallicity of 7.93 and very large 24@xmath1m - to-3.6@xmath1 m flux ratio .",
    "the one with number 2 is a luminous star - forming galaxies with strong pah emissions in irac 8@xmath1 m band .",
    "both of them have very blue @xmath33-@xmath11 color .",
    "actually , they are the only two galaxies with @xmath33-@xmath11 color less than @xmath48 in figure  [ fig8 ] . additionally , the stellar mass of 2 derived by using sdss photometries and spectral indices are apparently different .",
    "therefore , it is hard to define which one is the best estimator .",
    "the stellar mass estimated using photometries is about 1 dex less than the one estimated by spectral indices . for 1 and 3",
    ", there are no stellar masses values derived by spectral indices .    apart from emission directly from the photosphere of old red stars , the continuum from very small dust heated by hot stars , even some broad emission features @xcite which were indicated to be from pahs @xcite , could increase the mir luminosity of a galaxy .",
    "the dust emission dominates radiation of star - forming galaxies in the wavelength range beyond 5@xmath1 m , but could also enhance the 4.5@xmath1 m flux@xcite . to evaluate such effect , the 4.5@xmath1m - to-3.6@xmath1 m flux ratio is plotted against the 24@xmath1 m luminosity in figure  [ fig12 ] .",
    "the three outliers in figure  [ fig11 ] were marked with red crosses .",
    "the blue boxes are the agns .",
    "there are some agns with very high 4.5@xmath1m - to-3.6@xmath1 m luminosity ratios marked with red boxes . except these outliers",
    ", we find a correlation between 4.5@xmath1m - to-3.6@xmath1 m luminosity ratio and star formation for most of sources .",
    "because the 24@xmath1 m luminosity is the tracer of sfr , this correlation may be due to the dust emissions in the 4.5@xmath1 m band . with the assumption that the entire irac 3.6@xmath1 m band luminosity is from the stellar emission , a factor of 0.596 @xcite",
    "was used to scale the stellar continuum of 3.6@xmath1 m to that of 4.5@xmath1 m based on _",
    "starburst99 _ synthesis model @xcite with the solar metallicity and a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) between 0.1 and 120 @xmath49 .",
    "this factor is similar to that derived from the observed sed of early type galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the factor of 0.596 is plotted with dashed line in figure  [ fig12 ] .",
    "if this factor is available for all star - forming galaxies , we could estimate the dust emission fraction based on the correlations between 24@xmath1 m and total - infrared ( tir ) luminosities@xcite , e.g. , for luminous infrared galaxies with tir luminosity of @xmath50 , about  30% flux at rest - frame 4.5@xmath1 m is from dust emission .",
    "therefore , compared to the 4.5@xmath1 m emission , irac 3.6@xmath1 m emission is a better stellar mass tracer .",
    "this is also supported by the much tighter correlation between 3.6@xmath1 m and stellar masses in table 1 and 2 .",
    "due to the powerful uv emissions from agns , the dust surrounding them could be heated by central monsters and then re - radiate in ir range ( see ,",
    "e.g , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "higher mir - to - h@xmath21/mir - to - uv luminosity ratios were found by previous works based on @xmath0 observations @xcite .",
    "so we want to know whether the energy from agns could strengthen the 3.6@xmath1 m and 4.5@xmath1 m emissions .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] shows the correlations between stellar mass ratios and agn activities . here , just the agns located inside the two boundaries defined by @xcite are adopted .",
    "@xcite found that the contribution from agn light to the optical continuum was much weaker compared to from starburst .",
    "thus , ignoring the effect of agn emission on the estimation of referenced stellar mass would be reasonable .",
    "red boxes represent the respective agns in figure  [ fig12 ] with 4.5@xmath1m - to-3.6@xmath1 m flux ratio large than 0.9 .",
    "according to @xcite , we know that agns with very high 4.5@xmath1m - to-3.6@xmath1 m ratios may be qsos . in figure  [ fig13 ]",
    ", except those scatters , the stellar mass derived from mir luminosities keep constant with increasing @xmath27 , while figure  [ fig5](e2 , e3 ) show that agn activities can not disturb mass - to - luminosity ratio for agn - hosting galaxies , even at 4.5@xmath1m(figure  [ fig14 ] )",
    ". therefore , there seems no confirmed non - thermal radiations or dust emissions heated by agns in irac 3.6@xmath1 m and 4.5@xmath1 m detections . because all the sources here are type - ii agns , the powerful intrinsic extinction of dust torus of narrow line agns could be another explanation for non - detection of agns in 3.6@xmath1 m and 4.5@xmath1 m in our sample .",
    "the absence of agn emissions at 3.6@xmath1 m and 4.5@xmath1 m also indicate that the stellar mass formulae based on 3.6@xmath1 m and 4.5@xmath1 m luminosities are applicate to most agn - hosting galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] present the distributions of absolute b - band magnitudes , reference stellar masses and @xmath11 band concentration parameters .",
    "the distributions in figure  [ fig4 ] of composite galaxies and agns are strikingly different from those of star - forming galaxies , but similar to absorption line galaxies .",
    "these results indicate that agns in our sample tend to be hosted in early - type galaxies @xcite . based on these results and the discussions about the effect of star formation in @xmath64.2",
    ", we find star formation rates in our agn - hosting galaxies are lower .",
    "based on the sample cross - identified from spitzer swire field and sdss spectrographic survey , we derived the formulae to calculate the stellar mass using non - linear correlations wth irac 3.6@xmath1 and 4.5@xmath1 m luminosities . the mass - to - luminosity ratio of these two mir luminosities are sensitive to the ew(h@xmath21 ) , morphology and metallicity of galaxies , especially for the former one , while the value of the ew(h@xmath21 ) represents the sfh for normal galaxies .",
    "using the @xmath33-@xmath11 color to represent sfh , we re - calibrate the stellar mass formulae for various galaxies .",
    "we find these formulae are better than those which ignore the effect of sfh .",
    "we could not conclude the applicability to low metallicity galaxies due to a lack of such object in our sample , thus one must be really careful when adopting our formulae to estimate stellar masses of those galaxies .",
    "additionally , we found that the dust emission heated by hottest young stars could enhance the irac 4.5 @xmath1 m luminosity , especially for luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "so the formulae we derived are not applicate to these galaxies .",
    "and these formulae are also not applicate to the stronger agns , such as qsos , although almost all the agn - hosting galaxies in our sample present similar properties like absorption line galaxies ( early - type ) , with low sfrs .",
