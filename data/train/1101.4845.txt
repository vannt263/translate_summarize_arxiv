    "in the usual situations , dissipation , caused by coupling to the environment , is considered to be a serious enemy to quantum - mechanical systems as it leads to a rapid decay of the coherence .",
    "surprisingly , however , an appropriately designed coupling between the system and the reservoir can drive the system into a given pure state @xcite .",
    "this type of quantum - state engineering , driven by dissipation , recently has attracted considerable interest both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "a strong advantage of this approach is that the desired steady state is obtained without active control of the system .",
    "this should be contrasted with the standard approach in quantum - state engineering where dynamical control of the system is required ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "another advantage is that the target state can be obtained regardless of the initial state , making the state - engineering protocol insensitive to imperfections in the initial - state preparation .    in this paper , we present a method for phase and number squeezing in two - state bose systems using dissipation .",
    "our work is motivated by the importance of squeezed states in matter - wave interferometry @xcite . by using squeezed states ,",
    "the performance of an interferometer can be increased : phase - squeezed states improve the accuracy of the readout of the phase difference , and number - squeezed states make longer measurement times possible .",
    "the scheme presented here gives a way to perform both phase and number squeezing in cold atomic gases and provides an important building block for dissipation - driven quantum - state engineering .",
    "additionally , by extending our scheme to an optical lattice , we demonstrate that it can produce a new non - equilibrium phase characterized by a non - zero condensate fraction and thermal - like particle number statistics .",
    "our method can be applied to any two - state bose system , such as the one described by the two - site bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "this hamiltonian is often used to describe cold bose gases trapped in a double - well potential . here",
    ", @xmath1 is the tunneling matrix element , @xmath2 is the on - site interaction , and we have introduced the su(2 ) generators defined as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 annihilates ( creates ) an atom in mode @xmath7 .",
    "first , we consider a two - state bose system with a fixed number of particles .",
    "we assume that the system is coupled to an environment , leading to dissipative dynamics such that the time evolution of the density operator is governed by the master equation , @xmath8   + \\frac{\\gamma}{2 } \\left(2\\hat{c}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{c}^\\dagger - \\hat{c}^\\dagger\\hat{c}\\hat{\\rho } - \\hat{\\rho}\\hat{c}^\\dagger \\hat{c } \\right ) , \\label{eq_master}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the lindblad , or jump , operator .",
    "we propose the following jump operator for the creation of phase- and number - squeezed states ( hereafter called the squeezing jump operator ) : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 @xmath12 is a parameter by which we can control the squeezing @xcite . the jump operator can be realized in a system of trapped ultracold bose gas immersed in a background bose - einstein condensate of a different species of bosonic atoms @xcite .    in order to understand the action of our squeezing jump operator , we first consider the ideal case where there is no hamiltonian and the dynamics is driven by the dissipative terms alone . in the double - well setting , for example ,",
    "this can be achieved by making the potential barrier between the wells high enough so that @xmath13 . the interaction @xmath2 can be reduced using feshbach resonances .",
    "we start by calculating the amount of squeezing in the steady state",
    ". it can be characterized by the normalized phase- and number - squeezing parameters @xmath14 respectively , where @xmath15 @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the average spin is always parallel to the @xmath16 axis , @xmath17 . using the coherent - state approximation @xmath18 with @xmath19 , which holds for any value of @xmath11",
    "provided the number of particles @xmath20 @xcite and the truncation scheme based on the bogoliubov backreaction formalism @xmath21 @xcite , the equations of motion for @xmath22 and @xmath23 become @xmath24 in the second term on the right - hand side , the upper sign corresponds to @xmath25 , and the lower one corresponds to @xmath26 . the time constant @xmath27 of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , thus , is @xmath28 . since @xmath29 throughout the time evolution , in the steady state , we get @xmath30 where , again , the upper sign corresponds to @xmath25 and the lower sign corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "we see that a phase - squeezed state characterized by @xmath31 is obtained for @xmath32 , while @xmath33 yields a number - squeezed state for which @xmath34 .",
    "+    in general , the steady state of the time evolution is a mixed state .",
    "the amount of mixedness can be quantified using purity @xmath35\\equiv\\{(n+1)\\textrm{tr}[\\hat{\\rho}^2]-1\\}/n$ ] . for a pure state , @xmath35=1 $ ] , while the completely mixed state gives @xmath35=0 $ ] .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] show the time evolution of the squeezing and purity for @xmath36 ( and @xmath37 ) obtained by numerically solving the master equation with the squeezing jump operator .",
    "we have set @xmath38 ( upper panels ) and 0.74 ( lower panels ) .",
    "the value @xmath39 is chosen to demonstrate that our method can produce the same ( and even larger ) amount of squeezing than a different method used in an experiment with cold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates that , using the jump operator , we can obtain almost pure phase- and number- squeezed states .",
    "note that @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the steady states are predicted very accurately by eq .  .",
    "we now discuss the exact form of the steady state and show that our jump operator drives the system into a squeezed state .",
    "the jump operator can be written as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath44 is even , one of the eigenvalues is equal to zero , the corresponding normalized eigenstate is @xmath45 . here",
    ", we use the notation @xmath46 for a state that has @xmath47 particles in mode @xmath48 .",
    "state @xmath49 is a stationary state of the dynamics and can be written as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is a normalization factor .",
    "state @xmath49 is a phase - squeezed @xmath53 , a number - squeezed ( @xmath54 ) , or a coherent @xmath55 state .",
    "when @xmath44 is large , we can approximate @xmath56 in deriving these results , @xmath44 was assumed to be even . if @xmath44 is odd , the steady state can be a mixed state .",
    "however , the non - zero elements of the vector @xmath57 scale as @xmath58 , and @xmath49 becomes an approximate dark state of the jump operator for large @xmath44 .",
    "thus , in the large @xmath44 limit , @xmath49 is a steady state , regardless of whether @xmath44 is even or odd .",
    "now , we introduce the two - site bose - hubbard hamiltonian in addition to the dissipative terms . for simplicity , we assume @xmath13 .",
    "we have checked numerically that the effect of non - zero @xmath1 is much less important than that of non - zero @xmath2 and does not change the results qualitatively .",
    "the interaction term has the fock states @xmath46 as the steady states , while the dissipative part drives the system toward state @xmath49 , which is close to the coherent state @xmath59 .",
    "the steady state resulting from the competition between these terms is a mixed state .",
    "the @xmath44 dependence of the purity and squeezing of the steady state decreases with increasing @xmath44 and , at large @xmath44 , these quantities are determined only by @xmath11 and @xmath60 .",
    "the disappearance of the @xmath44 dependence can be seen by noting that both the interaction energy and the dissipative part scale as @xmath61 .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] show the time evolution of the squeezing and purity for the non - zero interaction .",
    "we have chosen @xmath36 . at this particle number ,",
    "the @xmath44 dependence of the purity of the steady state is already small for the values of @xmath11 used in this figure .",
    "we see that it is possible to obtain phase- and number - squeezed states with high purity even for non - zero @xmath2 , provided @xmath60 is small enough . to quantify the effectiveness of the squeezing jump operator , we plot the purity of the steady state at @xmath36 as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath60 in fig .",

    "this is because , for positive @xmath11 , the dissipative term favors number - squeezed states that are closer to fock states than phase - squeezed states .",
    "fock states are eigenstates of the interaction term and , therefore , steady states in the absence of dissipation .",
    "next , we consider single - mode squeezing using dissipation . in the absence of a hamiltonian , amplitude squeezing can be achieved using the jump operator , @xmath64 this is equivalent to having the jump operator @xmath65 and the hamiltonian @xmath66 with @xmath67 . as in the two - mode case",
