    "in the past , statistical studies of qso clustering have been limited by the small numbers of qsos available in homogeneously - selected catalogues@xcite .",

    ". however , the two composites are almost identical .",
    "in particular , the equivalent widths of the broad emission lines ( including civ ) are the same between the two surveys , providing further evidence that the ` baldwin ' effect is weak or non - existent in optically - selected qso catalogues@xcite .",
    "the only difference in the emission line properties occurs for the narrow lines ; the lbqs composite exhibiting much stronger narrow [ oii ] and [ oiii ] emission compared to the 2qz composite .",
