    "often turbulent phenomena are accompanied by random fluctuations of some scalar quantity .",
    "one may think of the density , temperature or optical refraction index for compressible flows , concentrations in the case of mixtures or reaction or combustion rates in the case of chemically active substances .",
    "important properties of these fields are their critical points , i.e. those points where their gradient vanishes .",
    "they give rise to a subdivision of these fields into `` dissipation elements '' @xcite very similar to the partition of the velocity field into `` eddies '' generated from the stagnation points @xcite .",
    "one should also mention @xcite where the routes to the generation of critical points out of simpler flows are studied .",
    "in addition to their importance for the characterization of the field , they are often also of direct physical significance .",
    "let us discuss the situation in more detail in case of a temperature field .",
    "there the heat flux is directed towards lower temperatures , i.e. the heat flux lines end in a temperature minimum .",
    "each temperature minimum is surrounded by a cell consisting of points with heat flux directed towards the minimum .",
    "it does of course not mean that the actual heat transport in the turbulent flow is appropriately described by this cell structure as the cells change from time to time and there usually is a significant contribution from convection to the heat transport .",
    "the cell structure is more suited to visualize the temperature field . as the cells are associated with temperature minima",
    "the distribution of the minima is of special interest .",
    "the distribution of the minima depends of course on the random properties of the turbulence and is therefore difficult to obtain .",
    "some hints can however be obtained if one assumes gaussian random fields , an assumption which is often made in turbulence studies .",
    "the properties of the critical points depend on the hessian matrix of the scalar field .",
    "the hessian of isotropic homogeneous random functions has been studied for two - dimensional fields by longuet - higgins @xcite in a paper on light reflection at a random surface and for three - dimensional fields by halperin and lax @xcite in a paper on impurities in semiconductors . in these early works",
    "the method of rice @xcite to represent a random function as a superposition of trigonometric functions is used .",
    "this method assumes implicitly homogeneity of the random function , its role was therefore not considered explicitly in these works .",
    "more recently the hessians of large dimensions were studied in the context of random matrix theory @xcite by fyodorov @xcite .",
    "the relation of the hessians to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) was clearly formulated in this work and it was shown that one can introduce a normally distributed auxiliary variable @xmath0 such that the ensemble of hessians of homogeneous isotropic random functions is obtained from goe by averaging over this variable . through this approach it is possible to apply results from goe studies at the cost of one extra average ( i.e. integration ) .",
    "fyodorov shows how this can effectively be done .",
    "the topic which is of high interest to us is the distribution of extrema in the critical points .",
    "the type of the critical point is determined by the sign distribution of the eigenvalues of the hessian .",
    "usually the number of negative eigenvalues is called the index of the matrix .",
    "methods of functional integration have been used by bray and dean @xcite to determine the asymptotic distribution of the index and fyodorov , sommers and williams @xcite have determined the asymptotic value of the minima i.e. the critical points of index zero . comparing their eqs .",
    "( 31 ) and ( 23 ) one finds that the probability of a critical point to be a minimum is asymptotically given by exp(-n ) for n - dimensional homogeneous random functions .",
    "the situation is completelely different for two - dimensional random functions .",
    "there it is well known that it follows from topological reasons or from the vanishing of the average of the determinant of the hessian that the densities of the extrema and of the saddle points agree .",
    "this is e.g. the basis of the poincare - index and of the brouwer - degree.@xcite for random functions with even probability distribution , e.g. in the gaussian case one has one half of the critical points with index 1 and a quarter with index zero or two .",
    "the four different sign combinations of the eigenvalues are equidistributed . on the other hand the result of fyodorov et",
    "al shows that the fraction of critical points which are minima , namely exp(-n ) , is for large matrices well below the fraction of @xmath1 to be expected for an equidistribution of signs .",
    "our interest is the three - dimensional case .",
    "there the strong topological restrictions from the two - dimensional case no longer apply . from morse theory",
    "@xcite one can conclude that the density of the extrema can not be smaller than the number of saddle points , but equality , as in two dimensions is no longer true . in an appendix",
    ", we describe functions having various fractions of minima .",
    "so we consider gaussian random functions .",
    "although we could use results of fyodorov for the critical point density , the situation is more complicated for the density of minima .",
    "so we stay with the ensemble of hessians and use the methods developped in random matrix theory as far as they apply and make use of the additional symmetry which follows from the homogeneity of the random functions .",
    "we think that this symmetry can best be expressed in terms of the wedge product of the exterior algebra .",
    "one finds that the average of all wedge products of column vectors of the hessian vanish .",
    "for the three - dimensional case one can then evaluate the remaining integrals by fairly elementary means and obtains for the fraction of minima under all critical points the value @xmath2 slightly less than @xmath3 to be expected for equidistribution of signs .",
    "to obtain the density of the critical points of a scalar random function @xmath4 , i.e. points in @xmath5-dimensional @xmath6-space where the gradient @xmath7 vanishes one observes that each critical point gives a contribution @xmath8 to the integral over @xmath9 , where @xmath9 denotes the dirac @xmath10-function . here",
    "@xmath11 denotes the jacobian matrix of @xmath12 , i.e. the hessian matrix of the second derivatives of @xmath13 and @xmath14 its determinant .",
    "then the density of the critical points @xmath15 can be obtained as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the average of @xmath18 .",
    "this is the so - called kac - rice formula .",
    "similarly the density @xmath19 of the minima of @xmath13 can be obtained from @xmath20 here @xmath21 denotes the characteristic function of the minima which is one if all eigenvalues of @xmath22 are positive and otherwise zero .    from the homogeneity condition one obtains with integration by parts @xmath23 this is in marked contrast random matrix theory where matrices @xmath24 from the goe fufill @xmath25 the isotropy of @xmath4 lead with to the probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the trace of the matrix and @xmath28 is a normalization constant .",
    "obviously all off - diagonal elements are independant and have the same normal distribution , exactly as for goe .",
    "differences occur only in the diagonal elements .",
    "therefore fyodorov introduced an additional normally distributed variable @xmath0 ( averages over @xmath0 are denoted by a subscript no ) and wrote with @xmath24 from goe @xmath29 to determine the mean square of @xmath0 one averages over goe and no to obtain for @xmath30 @xmath31 alternatively it is possible to assume @xmath32 and one obtains for @xmath30 @xmath33 and therefore @xmath34 this representation is useful for monte carlo calculations .",
    "now we want to show that the homogeneity condition implies that the average value of the determinant of @xmath22 vanishes .",
    "much more is true , namely the average of all coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath22 vanish ( with the obvious exception of the first one which is equal to one ) .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the goe where already the average of the determinant is different from zero .",
    "this property of @xmath22 can be conveniently shown using the exterior product of the exterior algebra @xcite .",
    "this is a product @xmath35 defined for @xmath36 on the vector space of @xmath37-tuples @xmath38 of vectors from some basic vector space of vectors @xmath39 which fulfills the associative and distributive laws and furthermore an anticommutative law @xmath40 as basic vector space we take an @xmath5-dimensional vector space with basic vectors @xmath41 and consider the row vectors of @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath42",
    ". then we can write the homogeneity condition as @xmath43 i.e. the wedge product of two arbitrary row vectors of @xmath22 has vanishing mean . as the average of an arbitrary number @xmath37 of gaussian random variables vanishes for odd @xmath37 and",
    "is for even @xmath37 just the sum of all partitions of the product into pairs and taking their averages one finds that all these averages vanish too , @xmath44 these equations show the high degree of symmetry of this gaussian matrix ensemble , all antisymmetric products have vanishing mean .",
    "one special case , namely @xmath45 , states the vanishing of the average determinant , @xmath46 from one can obtain a much more general equation .",
    "with one has also @xmath47 with arbitrary constant vectors @xmath48 .",
    "this can also be written as @xmath49 with an arbitrary constant matrix @xmath50 . for @xmath50",
    "proportional to the identity matrix shows , that the average of all nontrivial cofficients of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath22 vanishes .",
    "related results for goe can be found in @xcite where the moments of the characterstic polynomial have been determined . with an alternative derivation",
    "is possible .",
    "an interesting application of is possible in two dimensions .",
    "there the sign of @xmath14 is positive for extrema of @xmath13 and negative for saddle points .",
    "then we see from that implies equal densities of the extrema and of the saddle points in two dimensions , this argument , however , can not be carried over to higher dimensions , there one has equal densities of critical points of even and odd indices ( brouwer degree ) .",
    "from one notices that @xmath12 and @xmath22 are statistically independent . so the density of the critical points and of the maxima can be written as a product of two factors @xmath51 , where the first factor depends only on the average values of @xmath12 and the second of those of @xmath22 .",
    "the first factor is easily determined @xmath52 it remains to find the second factor .",
    "let us now restrict ourselves to three dimensions , @xmath53 .",
    "the pdf for the hessian is then given by @xmath54    we are interested in averages depending only on the eigenvalues of @xmath22 . then it is common @xcite to introduce the eigenvalues @xmath55 as new variables and to average over the remaining variables .",
    "as the ordering of the eigenvalues is arbitrary , we assume @xmath56 then it is shown in @xcite that the pdf in the eigenvalue space @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is a column vector of the eigenvalues .",
    "now we introduce new variables @xmath61 through @xmath62 one verifies easily that @xmath63 is the identity matrix .",
    "therefore the pdf reads in the new variables @xmath64 with spherical polar coordinates @xmath65 one obtains @xmath66 .",
    "as we are interested in the average of homogeneous quantities @xmath67 only , we can write @xmath68 now we can perform the @xmath69-integration and obtain @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the @xmath71-function .",
    "now we have reduced the integral from one in the 6-dimensional space of the @xmath72 to an integral over a 2-dimensional sphere .",
    "one finds easily , that @xmath73 corresponds to @xmath74 and @xmath75 to @xmath76 . then , because of the restriction the integration is not over the whole sphere but only over the segment @xmath77    -space .",
    "bright is the physically significant region .",
    "shown is also the partition into regions of only positive eigenvalues ( topmost region ) , one negative eigenvalue ( @xmath78 ) , two negative eigenvalues ( @xmath79 ) and all eigenvalues negative . ]",
    "the other regions of the sphere correspond to a different ordering of the eigenvalues.as the enumeration of the eigenvalues is usually arbitrary , one can as well integrate over the whole sphere and divide the result by the number of different orderings , namely six .",
    "the configuration is shown in figure 1 where we additionally show the cross section of the sphere with the planes @xmath80 ,",
    "@xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "as these planes , as well as @xmath73 and @xmath83 , all pass through the origin , the cross sections are all great circles .",
    "the segment is then divided into four spherical triangles .",
    "the topmost is bounded in addition to by @xmath80 , it corresponds therefore to eigenvalues which are all positive , the next triangle is bounded by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , corresponds therefore to one negative eigenvalue , the next one to two negative eigenvalues and the last one to eigenvalues which are all negative .",
    "one also notices that the segment and the pdf is not changed if the signs of the eigenvalues and their numeration is reversed .",
    "the four spherical triangles are however interchanged . therefore the first and the fourth and the second and the third lead often to contributions of the same size .",
    "as a first step , we determine the normalization constant @xmath28 of the pdf . as usual , it can be determined from the average of one which is one .",
    "as one is a homogeneous function of degree @xmath84 one has from @xmath85 now we determine the second factor @xmath86 for the spatial density of the minima . as",
    "the determinant of @xmath22 is a homogeneous function of third degree we obtain from @xmath87 which is to be evaluated over the unit sphere in y - space where all eigenvalues are positive , i.e. the topmost triangle in figure 1 . with @xmath88 and the indefinite integral @xmath89 we obtain for the integral @xmath90 over the topmost spherical triangle @xmath91 as the integral at @xmath92 vanishes obviously and where @xmath93 describes the great circle @xmath80 , i.e. from @xmath94 now the indefinite integrals @xmath95 and @xmath96 of @xmath97 and @xmath98 over @xmath80",
    "can again be determined easily , and one obtains @xmath99 with these indefinite integrals we get for @xmath100 @xmath101 and then also @xmath102 from where we have used the nomalization @xmath103 and these gives finally @xmath104 for the spatial density of the maxima .    to determine the probability of the saddle points , we have to integrate over the spherical triangle between the great circles @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath75 .",
    "the first one is given by @xmath105 and let the second be given by @xmath106 .",
    "from we obtain @xmath107 then the integral over this triangle @xmath108 can be written as @xmath109 where we have taken into account , that the integrand is negative between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "now @xmath110 gives @xmath111 and @xmath112 and therefore @xmath113 we then obtain from and @xmath114 and for the ratio of the density of minima to that of critical points @xmath115",
    "the distribution of critical points of a two - dimensional function is severely restricted by topological considerations . there",
    "the density of extremal points and saddle points agree , i.e. there is an equidistriburion of signs of the eigenvalues of the hessian . for three - dimensional functions these topological restrictions no longer apply and this ratio depends on the type of the function . for a gaussian homogeneous and isotropic random function",
    "slghtly less than @xmath3 of all critical points are minima .",
    "a comparison with results from computational fluid dynamics seems interesting .",
    "we are very grateful to h. schanz and t. schick for very helpful discussions .",
    "furthermore we express our thanks to the anonymous referees of an earlier version of this manuscript for pointing out to us the important work done on the hessians of homogeneous isotropic random functions .",
    "a simple function with many critical points is given by @xmath116 its critical points are the lattice points @xmath117 with integer @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "maxima occur when the integers are all even , minima when they are all odd .",
    "all other critical points are saddle points",
    ". obviously all sign combinations are equidistributed .",
    "under eight critical points one finds one maximum one minimum and 6 saddle points .",
    "we now indicate how functions with arbitrary ratios not smaller than one of densities of saddle points to extrema can be found .",
    "actually one can conclude from theorem 3.4 in the morse theory chapter of@xcite that this restriction on the critical points is a necessary one .",
    "there are no functions having a density of extrema larger than the density of saddle points .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to describe functions with various ratios of saddle point density to extrema density . as a first step",
    ", we describe that it is under certain conditions possible to combine two functions to a new function which has exactly the critical points of both combined . to be specific , let @xmath121 and @xmath122 be two smooth functions with @xmath123 and @xmath124 and furthermore @xmath125 the functions @xmath126 are such that @xmath127 has no critical points in a neighbourhood of @xmath128 and @xmath129 has only a finite number of critical points .",
    "let @xmath130 be a smooth non - increasing function which is one for @xmath131 and vanishes for @xmath132 .",
    "then one can define with some positive @xmath133 @xmath134 it is obvious that @xmath135 has for sufficiently small @xmath133 in @xmath136 just the critical points of @xmath129 and for @xmath137 just those of @xmath127 . with standard",
    "estimates one can verify , that for small enough @xmath133 there are no critical points in the transition region @xmath138 .",
    "now we describe functions having an arbitrary non - zero even number of saddle points and just two extrema .",
    "these functions can then be inserted in arbitrary numbers in some given smooth function and one can use them to generate functions having in any given domain an arbitrary rational ratio of saddle points to extrema above one . then it is also possible to build functions with a similar density ratio .",
    "these functions are necessarily three - dimensional .",
    "we nevertheless begin with a function of two variables @xmath139 , namely @xmath140 with positive @xmath18 and @xmath141 .",
    "later on we will think of @xmath69 and @xmath142 as cylindrical coordinates in a three - dimensional space .",
    "the discussion of this function is elementary , so we just describe the results . for small values of @xmath18 one has only a small perturbation of the linear function @xmath142 without any critical points . for somewhat larger @xmath18",
    "there are four critical points , one maximum , one minimum and two saddle points , all situated on the @xmath142-axis @xmath143 . for even larger values of @xmath18 , exactly for @xmath144",
    "the extrema remain on the @xmath142-axis while the saddle points move on the @xmath69-axis to @xmath145 with some positive @xmath146 and this is the case which is of interest to us . in three - dimensional space with cylindrical coordinates",
    "this function has however a non - generic critical circle @xmath147 , so we would like to replace @xmath18 by @xmath148 , @xmath149 being the angle in cylindrical polar coordinates .",
    "this function is not even continuous at @xmath143 , therefore we modify @xmath18 to some function @xmath150 .",
    "it is easily checked that the number and type of singularities is not changed if @xmath150 is a monotonically decreasing positive function of @xmath69 , which we assume .",
    "so , we have with @xmath151 a smooth function which has a maximum and a minimum , both on the @xmath142-axis and @xmath152 saddle points in the @xmath153 plane , provided @xmath154 is for all @xmath149 a monotonically decreasing positive function with @xmath155 and @xmath156 remains bounded at @xmath143 .",
