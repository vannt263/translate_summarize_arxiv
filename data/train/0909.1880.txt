    "in a recent paper@xcite , we have provided a general framework to describe the electric - field control of the electron spin in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with diffusive electron spin dynamics when both intrinsic and extrinsic spin - orbit interactions are present .",
    "the extrinsic mechanism for the spin hall effect arises to first order in the spin - orbit coupling strength , @xmath3 ( see below)@xcite .",
    "however , when also the intrinsic mechanism is present@xcite , a first - order calculation is no longer sufficient , since it is important to consider the elliot - yafet spin relaxation due to the spin - orbit scattering from impurities , which arises in the order @xmath4 . here , by using a keldysh green function approach@xcite , we provide a microscopic basis of the equation of motion for the spin density that governs the interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model hamiltonian and the method . in section 3",
    "we derive an expression for the spin current and an associated continuity equation . in section 4",
    ", we consider the specific case of the spin hall effect and derive a formula for the spin hall conductivity .",
    "finally , we state our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in the presence of both extrinsic and intrinsic spin - orbit interaction as well as normal potential scattering from impurities @xmath5 , the hamiltonian for the 2deg can be written in terms of a spin - dependent [ @xmath6 vector potential @xmath7 @xmath8 the vector potential is the sum of intrinsic ( rashba type ) and extrinsic contributions @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the vector of pauli matrices and @xmath11 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath12 and @xmath3 characterize the strength of the intrinsic and extrinsic spin - orbit interaction , respectively .",
    "the advantage of introducing the @xmath13 vector potential is that one can immediately derive a continuity equation for the spin density @xmath14 where the spin density is defined in terms of the heisenberg field operators @xmath15 and the spin current has the expression @xmath16 , with the velocity operator given by @xmath17 although eq .",
    "( [ operatorform ] ) is formally exact , it can not directly convey information for the _ disorder averaged _ spin current , since the disorder potential appears also in the vector potential @xmath18 . in order to carry out the average over the disorder , it is convenient to use the green function approach as developed in ref .",
    "it is also useful to explicitly separate the spin - orbit interaction due to the intrinsic mechanism from that due to the extrinsic mechanism . to this end",
    "we define a space - independent vector potential @xmath19 and a spin - dependent disorder potential @xmath20 the _ disorder averaged _ spin density is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the lesser component of the disorder averaged green function , here given in wigner coordinates@xcite .",
    "the current density is written as a sum of two terms , @xmath23 , associated to the normal , @xmath24 , and to the anomalous disorder - dependent components of the velocity , respectively .",

    "since the anomalous velocity contribution to the current contains explicitly the disorder potential , its expression can be obtained only after specifying the disorder model and the approximations used .",
    "later on , we will identify the expression for the anomalous current from the self - energy terms contributing to the continuity equation . in wigner",
    "coordinates and after a gradient expansion , the equation of motion for the green function @xmath27 reads @xmath28 = \\left [ { \\check \\sigma } , { \\check g}\\right].\\ ] ] the green function has a matrix structure in both the keldysh and spin space , and the symbol @xmath29 $ ] indicates a commutator .",
    "an external electric field @xmath30 is included via the substitution @xmath31 .",
    "the self - energy @xmath32 entering the rhs of the eq.([equationofmotion ] ) contains all the effect of the disorder potential defined in eq.([effectivepotential ] ) .",
    "we assume the standard model of uncorrelated impurities with @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the impurity concentration and @xmath35 the scattering amplitude .",

    "it is worthwhile pointing out that the anomalous disorder - dependent contribution to the current is one half of the side - jump contribution , @xmath68 .    the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling yields a contribution to the spin current due to the @xmath13 magnetic field @xmath69 , @xmath70 for the rashba model the only non - zero component of @xmath71 is @xmath72 leading to @xmath73 with @xmath74 . the extra terms of ref .",

    "more precisely we study the transverse spin current that is generated by a uniform electric field applied along the @xmath76-axis . according to eq.([spincurrent ] ) the spin current flowing along the @xmath77-axis reads @xmath78 where the first term originates from the covariant derivative defined in eq.([covariant ] ) .",
