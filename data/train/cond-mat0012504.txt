    "as a rule , superfluid states in a fermi - liquid ( fl ) are considered as arising as a result of a phase transition from the normal state .",
    "however , phase transitions that might also take place in a superfluid fl can lead to the emergence of new superfluid states .",
    "thus , we are speaking of phase transitions from one superfluid state to another .",
    "a new superfluid state can be characterized by not one but a few order parameters . in this report",

    "a fermi superfluid is described by the normal @xmath0 and anomalous @xmath1 distribution functions ( @xmath2 is the density matrix of the system , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the creation and annihilation operators of a fermion in the state with momentum @xmath5 , spin projection @xmath6 ; for a nucleon in nuclear matter the state is characterized also by the isotopic spin projection @xmath7 ) .",

    "@xmath45 @xmath46 one  gap solutions are obtained as solutions of the equations @xmath47 ( singlet pairing ) and @xmath48 ( triplet pairing ) , while two - gap solutions correspond to the case @xmath49 ( singlet - triplet pairing ) .",
