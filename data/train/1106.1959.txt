    "the fractional quantum hall ( fqhe ) was discovered@xcite when experimenters were searching for the wigner crystal@xcite ( wc ) .",
    "the expectation was that once the kinetic energy is quenched by forcing all electrons into the lowest landau level ( ll ) , the interaction energy would govern the physics and induce a wc.@xcite however , it turns out that , in a large range of filling factors of the lowest ll , the interaction energy favors the formation of composite fermions ( cfs ) instead , which form a liquid and produce the fqhe.@xcite however , when the interparticle separation is large compared to the size of a localized particle , namely the magnetic length @xmath1 , the wc should be stabilized .",
    "this condition can be achieved in two ways : ( i ) by reducing the magnetic length , which can be attained by going to very high fields ( or low filling factors ) ; and ( ii ) by increasing the interparticle separation , which can be conveniently accomplished by considering systems close to integer fillings , where , to the zeroth order approximation , only the electrons or holes in the topmost partially filled ll are relevant .",
    "it is useful to differentiate between these two kinds of wcs , both because they originate from different interparticle interactions , and because the density of the relevant particles in the latter actually depends on the magnetic field , vanishing at the magnetic field where the filling is an integer .",
    "we will therefore label these crystals  type - i \" and  type - ii \" wigner crystals , respectively .",
    "much experimental work has been performed to investigate such crystalline states.@xcite recently , microwave resonance experiments@xcite have extensively probed regions at low fillings and also near integer fillings and revealed resonances in the conductivity that are interpreted as the pinning mode of a wc .    interestingly , even though the formation of composite fermions was responsible for inhibiting the _ electron _ wc in a broad range of filling factors , composite fermions themselves can form a wc , which is called a composite fermion wc ( cfwc ) .",
    "composite fermions@xcite are bound states of electrons and quantized vortices .",
    "they experience an effective magnetic field @xmath2 and form landau - like levels called @xmath3 levels ( @xmath3ls ) .",
    "their filling factor @xmath4 is related to the electron filling factor by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of vortices attached to composite fermions . as for electrons , there exist two kinds of cfwcs :    _ type - i cfwc _ : it has been shown theoretically that at very low fillings , the cfwc has lower energy than the electron wc , i.e. the actual ground state is at type - i cfwc.@xcite essentially , electrons capture fewer than the maximum number of vortices available to them , and use the remaining degrees of freedom to form a wc .",
    "the cfwc has been shown to be an excellent approximation of the exact state in numerical diagonalization studies.@xcite these studies predict that composite fermions with a large number of attached vortices can occur in type - i cfwc , and that there should be transitions , as a function of the filling factor , from wc of one flavor of composite fermions to another .    _",
    "type - ii cfwc _ :",
    "the cfwc can also occur at cf fillings close to @xmath7 , which correspond to electron fillings close to @xmath8 .",
    "the state at @xmath7 contains an integer number of fully occupied @xmath3ls , and at nearby fillings the system has either a small density of composite fermions in an otherwise empty @xmath3l or a small density of cf holes in an otherwise full @xmath3l .",
    "these will form a type - ii cfwc.@xcite    we compute in this paper the static and dynamic properties of the type - ii cfwc .",
    "the primary motivation of our work comes from the remarkable recent experiments by zhu _",
    "et al._@xcite where a resonance was observed in a narrow region around @xmath0 and interpreted as the pinning mode of the type - ii cfwc . a comparison of the results of our calculation with the experimental observations shows a good agreement , thus supporting the formation of a cfwc .",
    "we study the cfwc by making an exact mapping of the problem of composite fermions in a partially filled @xmath3l to that of fermions in the lowest ll interacting via an effective interaction .",
    "various quantities can then be computed using the familiar methods developed in refs .",
    "( the type - ii cfwc was also studied by scarola _",
    "et al._@xcite in a variational study that compared the energies of the wc , bubble crystal , or stripe phases of composite fermions .",
    "that work , however , did not compute the shear modulus of the cfwc or the magnetophonon and magnetoplasmon dispersions , and also did not focus on the phase diagram of the cfwc . )",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "we estimate the ranges of stability for the cfwc around the filling factors @xmath9 .",
    "the theoretical range of stability around @xmath10 is consistent with the interpretation of microwave resonance experimental results around @xmath11 as a signature of the cfwc.@xcite we predict cfwc also around @xmath12 and @xmath13 , except in much narrower ranges of filling factor .",
    "we present results for the dispersions of the phonons as well as magnetoplasmon of the cfwc . using a model of chitra et .",
    "al.@xcite we argue that the frequency of the pinning resonance of the cfwc is expected to be of similar magnitude as that of the corresponding electron wc , and also determine the magnetic field dependence ; these are also consistent with experiments .",
    "a curious observation is that the hartree fock treatment is much more successful for the cfwc than for the electron wc .",
    "for example , maki and zotos@xcite found , with similar methods as those employed below , that the electron wc in the lowest ll is stable in the range @xmath14 ( and @xmath15 by particle hole symmetry in the lowest ll ) , which is grossly inconsistent with experiments that demonstrate wc only below approximately @xmath16 .",
    "on the other hand , the stability range we find for the cfwc is quite consistent with experiment . while this difference may seem surprising , it is easily understood .",
    "the hartree - fock approach fails for electrons in the lowest ll because they form strongly correlated states of composite fermions , not captured by the hartree fock approach .",
    "in contrast , the interaction between composite fermions is such that the cfwc state is destabilized before composite fermions can form their own strongly correlated fqhe states .",
    "for example , the @xmath17 fqhe state , which is a _",
    "fractional _ qhe of composite fermions@xcite at the composite fermion filling factor of @xmath18 , is outside the cfwc region , which persists , according to our calculation , only up to @xmath19 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the mapping from composite fermions in a partially filled @xmath3l to fermions in the lll .",
    "next , we solve the equations of motion for the cfwc , and calculate the shear modulus and the dispersion relations for the magnetophonon and magnetoplasmon collective modes of the this crystal .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of how our results compare with experimental observations .",
    "electrons in the lowest landau level exhibit exotic properties , which result from the formation of composite fermions , bound states of electrons and an even number of topological vortices . at the rational filling factors",
    "@xmath20 the ground state contains precisely @xmath21 filled @xmath3ls of composite fermions . of interest in this paper",
    "are filling factors close to these rational values , when the cf filling factor is given by @xmath22 in what follows below , we assume that the magnetic field is sufficiently strong that the system is fully spin polarized and ll mixing is negligible .",
    "our program proceeds along the following steps :    \\(i ) we treat the @xmath21 filled @xmath3ls as inert , and formulate the problem in terms of either solely the composite fermions in the @xmath23 @xmath3l ( for @xmath24 ) or the missing composite fermions in the @xmath25 @xmath3l ( for @xmath26 ) . the physics that we wish to investigate lies fully in the dynamics of these composite fermions . these are sometimes called cf quasiparticles and cf quasiholes , but we will refer to them simply as composite fermions below , while remembering that their filling factor is @xmath27 , and that their density vanishes at @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 ) .",
    "we do not include the physics of @xmath3l mixing in our work ; it will modify the form of the inter - cf interaction , but we do not believe that would significantly alter the results .",
    "\\(ii ) the two - body coulomb interaction between electrons generates a complex interaction between composite fermions that contains two , three and higher body terms .",
    "we assume that the physics is dominated by the two - body interaction ( determined in the next section ) .",
    "this should be a good approximation at sufficiently small densities of the composite fermions ; because the cf filling is found to be small in the entire range of stability of the cfwc determined below , we believe that the approximation of the neglect of three and higher body interaction terms in the cf hamiltonian does not cause significant corrections .",
    "there is also numerical evidence that this is a good approximation@xcite , but a systematic study of the importance of higher order interactions between particles as a function of system size has not been undertaken.@xcite    \\(iii ) we define the equivalent problem of fermions at filling factor @xmath27 in the lowest ll interacting via an appropriate effective interaction . the effective interaction used here has been shown to reproduce the desired interaction pseudopotentials with extremely good accuracy .",
    "\\(iv ) we calculate the properties of the wc of fermions at @xmath27 in a standard hartree fock approach.@xcite in particular , the instability of the cfwc is signaled by the shear modulus becoming negative .",
    "\\(v ) disorder is neglected throughout .",
    "this makes our results unreliable at very small values of @xmath27 , where the distance between the ( relevant ) composite fermions is so large that disorder will likely dominate over interaction , producing a localized or a glassy phase .",
    "however , we expect the neglect of disorder to be a good first approximation for weak disorder and not too large a lattice spacings ; here the wc order ought to persist meaningfully over several lattice spacings .    , both for composite fermions in the second @xmath3 level ( labeled  quasiparticle \" ) and cf quasiholes in the lowest @xmath3 level (  quasihole \" ) .",
    "at long distances , both interactions are coulombic , but have more complicated forms at short distance . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the cf wave functions can be obtained from the electron wave functions by the standard mapping : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a quantum number labeling the state , @xmath4 is the cf filling factor , and @xmath32 is the lll projection operator .",
    "the interaction between two composite fermions in the @xmath33 @xmath3l is determined by computing the cf pseudopotentials,@xcite i.e. the energies of the pair in definite relative angular momentum states , by analogy to the electron pseudopotentials in the @xmath34 ll .",
    "the pseudopotential for two electrons in relative angular momentum @xmath35 is defined as@xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the wave function of two electrons in the @xmath34 ll in relative angular momentum @xmath35 .",
    "the cf pseudopotentials are analogously defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 while for the calculation of of the electron pseudopotentials @xmath40 , it is sufficient to consider only two electrons in the @xmath34 ll , the evaluation of the cf pseudopotentials requires a full many - particle calculation , because the jastrow factor correlates all composite fermions with one another ( including those in lower @xmath3 levels ) .",
    "nonetheless , using the standard methods@xcite , the relevant integrals can be evaluated by the metropolis monte carlo method , and the thermodynamic limits for the cf pseudopotentials can be obtained .",
    "we refer the reader to the literature for further details.@xcite    we next define a problem of fermions confined to the lowest ll that have an effective interaction @xmath41 that produces the above pseudopotentials : @xmath42 where the superscript @xmath43 refers to the lowest ll .",

    "the last term captures the long distance limit of the interaction between composite fermions : @xmath48 , which is the coulomb interaction between particles of fractional charge @xmath49 at a distance @xmath50.@xcite the number of terms kept in the sum , and the coefficients @xmath51 , are determined to produce a good approximation for the pseudopotentials obtained from the microscopic theory .",

    "in certain places of relevance , the units will be explicitly restored .",
    "now , we consider the dynamics of fermions in the lll interacting with an effective interaction . since we are dealing with fermions in the lll , they all have the same kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , the ground state of the system is decided entirely by interactions between the fermions .",
    "since we will be working at low filling factors , we make the ansatz that our system is described by a crystal state@xcite , for which we choose the hexagonal ( or triangular ) lattice symmetry , which it is known to give the lowest energy for the 2d classical wc.@xcite the localized single particle states are wave packets : @xmath56 centered at hexagonal lattice sites @xmath57 where @xmath58 are integers and @xmath59 the lattice constant .",

    "( [ vmz ] ) .",
    "the individual two body terms are interpreted as semiclassical energy of particles located at the lattice sites of a hexagonal lattice .",

    "these interactions have a complicated form as a function of the distance , and can even be attractive , but at long distance the interaction is always repulsive .",
    "the attractive portion of the interaction between the composite fermions might seem to suggest that the crystal is unstable to pairing , but the issue is somewhat subtle because the gain in energy due to pairing is accompanied by a competing enhancement in the interaction energy between the pairs .",
    "it has been shown by an explicit calculation reported in ref .",
    "[ ] that for sufficiently small values of @xmath27 a wc state is energetically preferred over the paired liquid state , although the formation of bubble crystals , where each lattice site supports more than one composite fermion , can result from an attractive interaction in some filling factor ranges .",
