    "anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime is one of the simplest and most interesting spacetimes allowed by general relativity .",
    "it is the unique maximally symmetric solution of the vacuum einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant ( for geometrical properties of ads space and its uses see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "quantum field theory in ads background has long been an active field of research for a variety of reasons .",
    "first of all , ads spacetime has a high degree of symmetry and , because of this , numerous physical problems are exactly solvable in this geometry .",
    "the maximal symmetry of ads simplifies many aspects of the study of quantum fields and the investigations of the corresponding field - theoretical effects may help to develop the research tools and insights to deal with more complicated geometries .",
    "much of early interest to quantum field theory on ads bulk was motivated by principal questions of the quantization of fields on curved backgrounds .",
    "the lack of global hyperbolicity and the presence of both regular and irregular modes give rise to a number of new features which have no analogues in quantum field theory on the minkowski bulk .",
    "being a constant negative curvature manifold , ads space provides a convenient infrared regulator in interacting quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "its natural length scale can be used to regularize infrared divergences without reducing the symmetries .",
    "the importance of this theoretical research was increased by the natural appearance of ads spacetime as a ground state in supergravity and kaluza - klein theories and also as the near horizon geometry of the extremal black holes and domain walls .",
    "a further increase of interest is related to the crucial role of the ads geometry in two exciting developments of the past decade such as the ads / cft correspondence and the braneworld scenario with large extra dimensions .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite ( see also @xcite ) represents a realization of the holographic principle and relates string theories or supergravity in the ads bulk with a conformal field theory living on its boundary .",
    "it has many interesting consequences and provides a powerful tool for the investigation of gauge field theories . among the recent developments of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence is the application to strong - coupling problems in condensed matter physics ( familiar examples include holographic superconductors , quantum phase transitions and topological insulators ) .",
    "moreover , the correspondence between the theories on ads and minkowski bulks may be used to derive new results in mathematical physics , in particular , in the theory of special functions ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . the braneworld scenario ( for reviews",
    "see @xcite ) offers a new perspective on the hierarchy problem between the gravitational and electroweak mass scales . the main idea",
    "to resolve the large hierarchy is that the small coupling of four - dimensional gravity is generated by the large physical volume of extra dimensions .",
    "braneworlds naturally appear in string / m - theory context and present intriguing possibilities to solve or to address from a different point of view various problems in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "an inherent feature of all these models is that the boundary conditions on the fields should be specified in order to completely determine the dynamics .",
    "first of all the ads spacetime is not globally hyperbolic and has a time - like future null infinity . as a consequence of this",
    ", the information may be lost to , or gained from , spatial infinity in finite coordinate time . in order to define a consistent quantum field theory ,",
    "appropriate boundary conditions must be imposed @xcite .",
    "the general class of allowed boundary conditions on the ads boundary has been discussed in ishi04 , based on the analysis of @xcite .",
    "different boundary conditions lead to different theories , in particular to different conformal field theory duals . in braneworld models on ads bulk",
    ", the presence of branes gives rise to additional boundary conditions on the operator of a quantum field .",
    "these conditions depend on the specific geometry of the brane and have been discussed in @xcite for models with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "another type of boundary conditions is induced by the presence of compact spatial dimensions .",
    "the extra compact dimensions are an inherent feature of braneworld models arising from string and m - theories . in these models",
    "one needs also to specify the periodicity conditions along compact dimensions .",
    "different conditions correspond to topologically inequivalent field configurations @xcite .",
    "the nontrivial periodicity conditions lead to a number of interesting quantum field - theoretical effects , which include instabilities in interacting field theories , topological mass generation , and symmetry breaking .",
    "all these types of boundary conditions , imposed on the field operator , modify the spectrum of the zero - point fluctuations of a quantum field . as a consequence , the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of physical observables are shifted by an amount depending on the geometry of the boundary and on the type of the boundary condition .",
    "this general phenomena is known as the casimir effect .",
    "it has important implications on all scales , from mesoscopic condensed matter physics to cosmology . since the original research by casimir @xcite , for the electromagnetic field in the geometry of two parallel conducting plates ,",
    "many theoretical and experimental works have been done in this direction ( for reviews see @xcite ) . in braneworlds ,",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on the bulk fields will give casimir - type contributions to the vacuum energy and to the vacuum forces acting on the branes .",
    "the latter provide a natural mechanism for stabilizing the interbrane distance ( radion ) in randall - sundrum - type models .",
    "the casimir energy gives a contribution to both the brane and the bulk cosmological constants and should be taken into account in the self - consistent formulation of the scenario .",
    "motivated by these issues , the investigations of the casimir energy and related forces on ads bulk have attracted a great deal of attention ( see , for instance , the references in @xcite ) .",
    "the casimir effect in higher - dimensional generalizations of the ads spacetime with compact internal spaces has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "an important physical characteristic of the vacuum state for charged fields is the expectation value of the current density .",
    "it carries information about the geometry and topology of the background space and is responsible for the backreaction of the quantum field , as a source in semiclassical maxwell s equations .",
    "in the present paper we investigate the vev of the current density for a charged scalar field in background of locally ads spacetime with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions , in the presence of a brane parallel to the ads boundary .",
    "the corresponding problem in the absence of the brane has been considered recently in @xcite and here we shall be mainly concerned with the brane - induced effects .",
    "both the zero and finite temperature expectation values of the current density for charged scalar and fermionic fields in background of flat spacetime with toroidal dimensions were investigated in beze13c , bell10 .",
    "applications were given to the electronic subsystem of cylindrical and toroidal carbon nanotubes described in terms of a @xmath1-dimensional effective field theory .",
    "the vacuum current densities for charged scalar and dirac spinor fields in de sitter spacetime with toroidally compact spatial dimensions are considered in @xcite .",
    "the influence of boundaries on the vacuum currents in topologically nontrivial spaces are studied in @xcite for scalar and fermionic fields .",
    "the effects of nontrivial topology induced by the compactification of a cosmic string along its axis have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we specify the bulk and boundary geometries under consideration and evaluate the hadamard function for a charged massive scalar field in both regions on the right and on the left to the brane ( referred to as r- and l - regions , respectively ) .",
    "the brane - induced contributions are manifestly extracted and they are presented in the form well suited for the investigation of the vevs of local physical observables bilinear in the field .",
    "as such an observable , in section [ sec : curr ] , we consider the current density .",
    "the corresponding vevs are decomposed into boundary - free and brane - induced contributions for both r- and l - regions .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the brane - induced contributions is considered near the brane , near the ads boundary and near the horizon .",
    "limiting expressions are derived for small and large proper lengths of compact dimensions .",
    "the main results are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] . in appendix",
    "we provide alternative representations for the hadamard functions in the r- and l - regions .",
    "the expressions for the current densities obtained from these representations are used for the investigation of the near brane asymptotic .",
    "we consider a charged quantum scalar field @xmath2 with the mass @xmath3 and with the curvature coupling parameter @xmath4 . in the presence of an external classical gauge field @xmath5",
    ", the corresponding field equation reads @xmath6where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the charge of the field quanta , @xmath9 is the operator of the covariant derivative associated with the metric tensor @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the ricci scalar for the background spacetime .",
    "the background geometry in the present paper is given by the interval @xmath12where @xmath13 is the metric tensor for @xmath14-dimensional minkowski spacetime , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 run from 0 to @xmath17 .",
    "the local geometry described by ( [ metric ] ) coincides with that for @xmath18-dimensional ads spacetime of the radius @xmath19 , expressed in poincar coordinates .",
    "the corresponding metric tensor is a solution of the einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant @xmath20 and for the ricci scalar one has @xmath21 .",
    "the spatial topology considered here will be different from that for ads .",
    "namely , we assume that the subspace with the coordinates @xmath22 , @xmath23 , is compactified to a @xmath24-dimensional torus @xmath25 with @xmath26 ( for a recent review of quantum field - theoretical effects in toroidal topology see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath27 the length of the @xmath28th compact dimension , @xmath29 .",
    "the ranges of the remaining coordinates are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , for the subspace perpendicular to the @xmath33-axis we take the topology @xmath34 .",

    "is given by @xmath36 and it decreases with increasing @xmath33 .",

    "we consider a field theory in a non - simply connected spacetime and for the complete formulation of the problem the periodicity conditions along compact dimensions should be specified . here",
    "we impose the conditions@xmath44for @xmath45 with constant phases @xmath46 . in the literature ,",
    "the most frequently considered special cases correspond to @xmath47 ( untwisted scalar ) and @xmath48 ( twisted scalar ) .",
    "as we will see below , the nontrivial phases in the periodicity conditions give rise to the vacuum currents along compact dimensions . in the discussion below",
    "we shall assume that the gauge field @xmath5 is constant .",
    "though the corresponding field strength vanishes , because of the nontrivial topology of the background spacetime , the vevs of physical observables will be influenced by this sort of field configuration .",
    "this is an aharonov - bohm like effect of a constant gauge field .",
    "let us consider two sets of the fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 connected by the gauge transformation @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "for a constant gauge field , taking the function @xmath53 , we see that in the new gauge the vector potential vanishes , @xmath54 .",
    "but , after the gauge transformation the vector potential of the former gauge appears in the periodicity conditions for the new field operator:@xmath55with @xmath45 , and with the new phases@xmath56 in particular , nontrivial phases are generated for untwisted and twisted scalars .",
    "the phase shift in ( [ perc2 ] ) is related to the magnetic flux @xmath57 enclosed by the @xmath28th compact dimension : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the flux quantum .",
    "note that the gauge field fluxes play an important role in recent developments of string theory compactifications ( for a review see @xcite ) .    in the problem under consideration ,",
    "the second type of boundary condition imposed on the field operator is induced by a brane parallel to the ads boundary and located at @xmath60 . the corresponding value for the conformal coordinate @xmath40 we shall denote by @xmath61 . on the brane",
    "we assume a gauge invariant boundary condition of the robin type : @xmath62where @xmath63 is a constant and @xmath64 is the inward pointing normal to the brane . for the latter one",

    "note that , in general , the value of the coefficient @xmath63 for these regions could be different .",
    "the robin boundary condition is a generalization of dirichlet and neumann conditions and naturally appears in a number of physical problems , including those in braneworld scenario ( see below ) .",
    "the spatial geometry under consideration for @xmath69 , embedded into the 3-dimensional euclidean space , is displayed in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the compact dimension is presented by the circles and the thick circle corresponds to the location of the brane .",
    "we have also depicted the gauge field flux tube enclosed by the compact dimension .",

    "the choice of the vacuum state is among the basic points .",
    "in what follows it will be assumed that the field is prepared in the poincar vacuum state .",
    "the latter is realized by the mode functions of the field which are obtained by solving the field equation in poincar coordinates ( for the discussion of the relation between the poincar and global vacua see , for instance , dani99 ) .",

    "the procedure we shall use here for the evaluation of the expectation value is based on the formula @xmath73where @xmath74is the hadamard function for the vacuum state under consideration . in ( had ) , the summation goes over a complete orthonormal set of positive- and negative - energy mode functions @xmath75 specified by a collective index @xmath76 involving the corresponding quantum numbers .",

    "having determined the complete set of normalized modes , from the mode - sum in ( [ had ] ) , for the hadamard function one obtains the representation@xmath112 in order to extract explicitly the brane - induced contribution , we subtract from ( [ gl1 ] ) the corresponding hadamard function in the boundary - free ads background which will be denoted by @xmath113 .",
    "the latter is obtained from ( [ gl1 ] ) replacing the last fraction in the right - hand side by the product @xmath114 . by using the identity@xmath115with @xmath116 being the hankel functions ,",
    "the following decomposition is obtained@xmath117now , assuming that @xmath118 , we rotate the integration contour of the last integral by the angle @xmath119 for @xmath120 and by @xmath121 for @xmath122 . introducing the modified bessel functions @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the following final expression is obtained:@xmath125where the notation with overbar is defined by ( [ fbar ] ) , ( [ a0 ] ) with @xmath126 .    in deriving ( [ gl3 ] ) we have assumed that for all the modes of the field @xmath127 is real .",

    "assuming that @xmath133 , one has @xmath134if @xmath135 , then there are modes for which the energy is purely imaginary and the vacuum state is unstable . in order to have a stable vacuum , in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath136 . from the boundary condition ( [ rob ] )",
    "it follows that for bound states the possible values of @xmath137 are roots of the equation@xmath138by using the recurrence relation for the macdonald function , this equation can be rewritten as@xmath139with @xmath140 . from here",
    "it follows that there are no bound states for @xmath141 ( for the special mode in the case @xmath142 see below ) . for @xmath143",
    "a single bound state @xmath128 appears .",
    "the corresponding root @xmath137 increases with increasing @xmath144 and for some critical value @xmath145 one gets @xmath146 . here , @xmath147 is the value of the robin coefficient for which the root of the equation is equal to @xmath148 .",
    "the stability of the vacuum state requires the condition @xmath149 .",
    "the critical value for the robin coefficient depends on the lengths of the compact dimensions , on the phases in periodicity conditions and on the mass of the field through the parameter @xmath84 .",
    "note that for a brane on ads bulk with all dimensions being non - compact one has @xmath150 and all the modes with @xmath151 , @xmath129 , lead to the instability .",
    "hence , in models with compact dimensions the stability condition , in general , is less restrictive . assuming that @xmath143 , let us denote by @xmath152 the root of the equation ( [ bsval2 ] ) .",
    "this root increases with increasing @xmath144 and does not depend on the location of the brane .",
    "the stability condition for the vacuum state is written as @xmath153 .",
    "from here it follows that , for fixed values of the other parameters , when the brane approaches the ads boundary ( @xmath154 decreases ) , started from the critical value @xmath155 , the vacuum in the r - region becomes unstable .",
    "the coefficient @xmath156 in ( [ bs ] ) is found from the normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) making the replacement @xmath157 . by using the result for the integral involving the square of the macdonald function @xcite , one gets@xmath158 in deriving this expression we have used the relations @xmath159valid for @xmath160 , with @xmath161 being the solution of ( bsval ) .",
    "these relations are obtained by making use of ( [ bsval ] ) and the wronskian relation for the modified bessel functions .",
    "now , in the presence of the bound state , the mode sum for the hadamard function has two contributions .",
    "the first one comes from the modes with real @xmath95 and is given by the expression ( [ gl1 ] ) .",
    "the second contribution comes from the bound state . for the latter , by using the corresponding mode functions ( [ bs ] ) and the normalization coefficient from ( [ cbsig ] ) , one finds@xmath162the evaluation of the part coming from the modes with real @xmath95 is similar to that we have described above .",
    "the difference arises in the step when we rotate the integration contour in ( [ gl2 ] ) .",
    "now , the integrand in this expression has poles @xmath163 on the imaginary axis , where @xmath137 is the root of ( [ bsval ] ) .",
    "after the rotation , the integration contour has to pass round these poles on the right by small semicircles .",
    "the integrals over the semicircles around @xmath128 and @xmath164 give the residue at @xmath128 multiplied by @xmath165 .",
    "it can be seen that this residue term exactly cancels the contribution of the bound state in ( [ gb ] ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the expression ( [ gl3 ] ) for the hadamard function is valid in the case of the presence of bound states as well .",
    "in addition to the modes discussed above , a mode may be present for which @xmath166 and @xmath167 .  for this mode the function @xmath168 in ( modes )",
    "is a linear combination of @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the part with @xmath169 is excluded by the normalizability condition and the mode functions have the form@xmath171these modes are normalizable under the condition @xmath172 and for the coefficient one finds@xmath173from the boundary condition on the brane it follows that the mode is allowed for the special value of the robin coefficient determined from @xmath174for @xmath87 this value corresponds to neumann boundary condition and in this case the mode function does not depend on the coordinate @xmath40 .",
    "an example of this special case is realized by a minimally coupled massless scalar field .",
    "note that this special mode for a scalar field is the analog of the zero mode of the graviton in randall - sundrum 1-brane model rand99 .    for @xmath172 and in the case of robin boundary condition with ( [ betsp ] )",

    "from here it follows that the contribution of the mode ( [ modesp ] ) to the hadamard function is expressed as @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the corresponding function for a massless scalar field in @xmath17-dimensional minkowski spacetime with the spatial topology @xmath180 . by using the expression for the latter one",

    "indeed , under the condition ( [ betsp ] ) , the contribution ( [ grs ] ) of this mode is separately added to the right - hand sides of ( [ gl1 ] ) and ( [ gl2 ] ) .",
    "now we should take into account that the integrand in ( [ gl2 ] ) with separate @xmath184 has a simple pole at @xmath185 and in the rotation of the integration contour this pole should be avoided by arcs of a circle of small radius .",

    "<S> the two - point function and the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the current density are investigated for a massive charged scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling in the geometry of a brane on the background of ads spacetime with partial toroidal compactification . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a gauge field flux , enclosed by compact dimensions , is assumed . on the brane the field obeys robin boundary condition and along compact dimensions periodicity conditions with general phases are imposed . there is a range in the space of the values for the coefficient in the boundary condition where the poincar vacuum is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> this range depends on the location of the brane and is different for the regions between the brane and ads boundary and between the brane and the horizon . in models with compact dimensions </S>",
    "<S> the stability condition is less restrictive than that for the ads bulk with trivial topology . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum charge density and the components of the current along non - compact dimensions vanish . </S>",
    "<S> the vev  of the current density along compact dimensions is a periodic function of the gauge field flux with the period equal to the flux quantum . </S>",
    "<S> it is decomposed into the boundary - free and brane - induced contributions </S>",
    "<S> . the asymptotic behavior of the latter is investigated near the brane , near the ads boundary and near the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , in contrast to the vevs of the field squared and energy - momentum tensor , the current density is finite on the brane and vanishes for the special case of dirichlet boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> both the boundary - free and brane - induced contributions vanish on the ads boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the brane - induced contribution vanishes on the horizon and for points near the horizon the current is dominated by the boundary - free part . in the near - horizon limit , the latter is connected to the corresponding quantity for a massless field in the minkowski bulk by a simple conformal relation . depending on the value of the robin coefficient , the presence of the brane can either increase or decrease the vacuum currents . </S>",
