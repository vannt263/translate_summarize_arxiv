    "electronic devices based on organic semiconductors , such as polymeric field effect transistors ( fets ) and light emitting diodes ( leds ) , have attracted much interest as possible inexpensive and flexible alternatives to inorganic devices@xcite . while there has been considerable improvement in device properties ,",
    "the detailed mechanism of electronic transport in organic thin film devices remains a subject of active investigation .",
    "charge motion in undoped organic field effect devices is often characterized in the linear ( small source - drain bias ) regime by a field - effect mobility . in disordered polymer semiconductors",
    "this mobility , @xmath0 , is strongly temperature dependent near room temperature , consistent with thermally assisted hopping between localized states dispersed throughout the polymer film@xcite .",
    "these localized states are likely to be polaronic@xcite .",
    "several different models for hopping transport in these materials have been used to interpret experimental data from @xmath2200  k to room temperature , including simple thermal activation@xcite , 2d variable range hopping ( vrh)@xcite , and percolative vrh with an exponential density of states@xcite . while some models work better with some specific samples , generally distinguishing between them is difficult .",
    "the situation is complicated by the fact that the effective mobilities inferred in this manner depend on @xmath1 , gated charge density@xcite , source - drain bias , and contact effects .",
    "parasitic contact resistances in particular can be important .",
    "experiments in several organic semiconductor / electrode combinations@xcite have shown that contact resistances can be a significant fraction of the total source - drain resistance in the linear regime in short devices .",
    "data in this shallow channel limit must be corrected accordingly for this parasitic series resistance , @xmath3 , to find the true mobility within the semiconductor . as with @xmath0",
    ", one must bear in mind that @xmath3 typically depends on temperature , gate voltage , and local electric field@xcite .",
    "when examining transport properties of organic fets , it is therefore important to determine whether the devices are dominated by the bulk ( channel ) or the contacts .",
    "we report _ nonlinear _ transport measurements in field - effect devices made from high quality , solution cast , regio - regular poly(3-hexylthiophene ) ( p3ht ) , with channel lengths from 3  @xmath0 m to 200  nm and aspect ratios of 10 .",
    "higher temperature properties at low source - drain fields are consistent with those observed by other investigators . from 200  k to 10  k , we observe gate - modulated nonlinear @xmath4 characteristics .",
    "to understand the effects of contacts in our series of devices , we examined both the devices described above , and an additional series of fixed - width fets to obtain the channel and contact resistances as a function of temperature .",
    "these data demonstrate that ( a ) the fixed - apect - ratio devices are bulk ( not contact ) limited at high temperatures ; and ( b ) the contribution of contacts relative to the channel actually _ decreases _ as the temperature is lowered , so that bulk - limited devices tend to remain so as @xmath1 is decreased . since the nonlinearities in the @xmath4 curves become more pronounced at low temperatures and in wider devices ( for which contact resistance are proportionately less important ) , it is unlikely that these nonlinearities are due to contact effects in these geometries .",
    "we find that the nonlinear data are consistent with a model of poole - frenkel ( pf ) type conduction in the space - charge limited ( scl ) regime . within this framework ,",
    "the strong gate and temperature dependence of this conduction are consistent with a density of localized valence states that varies approximately exponentially in energy .",
    "still within this model , at temperatures below 30  k there appears to be a crossover from thermally assisted hopping to a nonthermal mechanism .",
    "these nonlinear data over a broad temperature range constrain any other models of transport in such devices . studying fets in this nonlinear regime",
    "allows comparisons between models not readily performed with linear transport data .",
    "devices are made in a bottom - contact configuration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mobt ] inset ) on a degenerately doped @xmath5 silicon wafer to be used as a gate .",
    "the gate dielectric is 200  nm of thermal sio@xmath6 .",
    "source and drain electrodes are patterned using standard electron beam lithography .",
    "the electrodes are deposited by electron beam evaporation of 4  nm ti and 25  nm of au followed by liftoff .",
    "the fixed - aspect - ratio devices have channel lengths ranging from 3  @xmath0 m down to 200  nm , with the channel width scaled to maintain @xmath7 larger fet devices ( @xmath8  1  mm , @xmath9  50  @xmath0 m ) are also prepared for comparison .",
    "we also examine a second set of devices with fixed width @xmath10 m and channel lengths varying from 5  @xmath0 m up to 40  @xmath0 m , specifically for probing contact resistance issues .",
    "the organic semiconductor is 98% regio - regular p3ht@xcite , a well studied material@xcite .",
    "p3ht is known from x - ray scattering to form nanocrystalline domains with sizes on the order of 20  nm@xcite , and more ordered films correlate with higher measured mobilities . rr - p3ht is dissolved in chloroform at a 0.02% weight concentration , and is solution cast@xcite onto ozone - cleaned , choloroform - swabbed substrates .",
    "the fixed - aspect - ratio series of devices are from one casting , while the fixed - width series are from a second casting .",
    "the resulting film thicknesses over the channel region are tens of nm as determined by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , though casting produces somewhat nonuniform films .",
    "all devices are stored in vacuum dessicators until use .",
    "the measurements are performed in vacuum ( @xmath11  torr ) in a variable - temperature probe station using a semiconductor parameter analyzer ( hp4145b ) .",
    "at room temperature , the devices operate as standard @xmath12-type fets in accumulation mode@xcite . with the source electrode as ground , in the linear regime we extract@xcite an effective mobility from the transconductance .",
    "that is , from data of source - drain current , @xmath13 versus the gate voltage , @xmath14 , at a fixed low drain voltage , @xmath15 , we compute @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the transconductance , @xmath18 is capacitance per unit area of the gate insulator , and @xmath19 is the aspect ratio .",
    "the relevance of parasitic contact resistances will be addressed below . as is reported elsewhere@xcite ,",
    "the mobility is gate voltage dependent , increasing with increasing @xmath14",
    ". it also increases with increasing source - drain voltage .",
    "effective mobilities are typically between @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22/vs , and apparent threshold voltages ( @xmath23 ) , though not necessarily meaningful@xcite , are low ( @xmath24 v ) . for @xmath25  50",
    "@xmath0 m fets operated in the saturation regime , the on / off ratio is typically @xmath26 , comparing between gate voltages of -95  v and 0  v. as temperature is reduced below 300  k , the off - current drops to undetectable levels by 150  k , as the unintentional carriers ( due to slight doping from air exposure ) freeze out .    over the moderate temperature range of 300  k to @xmath2 200  k",
    ", the mobility as inferred above at fixed small @xmath15 is found to depend steeply on temperature .",
    "a small representative set of this data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mobt ] , where @xmath0 is plotted vs. inverse temperature for @xmath27   and -50  v , for the @xmath28  nm , @xmath29 m device at constant source - drain electric field of @xmath30 v / m .",
    "these data are approximately equally consistent with the three models mentioned above : simple arrhenius behavior ( the dashed line ) with an activation energy @xmath2 100  mev ; vrh for a 2-d system ( dotted line ) , of the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are fit parameters ; and finally the more sophisticated percolative vrh theory ( solid lines ) developed by vissenberg _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "the vissenberg model s underlying assumptions include an exponential density of ( localized ) states ( dols ) , @xmath34 , with transport of carriers dictated by percolative hopping .",
    "since the gate voltage controls the fermi level in the channel , and hence the occupation of the localized states , one finds that transport in the channel is strongly affected by @xmath14 .",
    "relevant fit parameters @xcite are : @xmath33 , describing the energy dependence of the dols ; a prefactor @xmath35 with units of conductivity ; and @xmath36 , an effective overlap parameter for hopping .",
    "values used in the fits shown are @xmath37  s , @xmath38  418  k , @xmath39  m@xmath40 , consistent with those seen by other investigators in p3ht@xcite .",
    "as temperatures are lowered from 200  k down to 10  k , over a broad range of source - drain and gate voltages , @xmath13 evolves from approximately linear to a strongly nonlinear ( superquadratic ) dependence on @xmath15 .",
    "an example of this evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonliniv ] for the @xmath41 m , @xmath42 m device , comparing data at 300  k and 70  k. we note that , at the lowest temperatures , smaller devices transport current _ more easily _ ( larger currents at smaller gate voltages for a fixed @xmath43 ) than larger devices , as we will discuss later .",
    "analysis below shows that the nonlinear @xmath4 characteristics are decribed well by a model incorporating space - charge limited currents , modified by a poole - frenkel - like exponential dependence of effective mobility on square root of the local electric field ( sclpf ) .",
    "this conduction mechanism has been seen repeatedly in _",
    "two_-terminal devices@xcite .",
    "room temperature experiments@xcite on p3ht fets with 70  nm channel lengths also show indications of scl currents .",
    "we find that within this model , the temperature and gate voltage dependence of the data support a strongly energy dependent dols such as that in the vissenberg picture .",
    "other models may be possible , but they are constrained by the dependences presented below .",
    "charge transport in a device is space charge limited if the injected carriers significantly alter the local electric field from the average field imposed by the electrode potentials , and correspondingly limit the current .",
    "if , instead , the bottleneck in charge transport is injection at the contacts , a device is said to be contact limited , and is expected to exhibit ohmic behavior at low source - drain fields . in principle , modeling our devices requires the full solution of the steady state charge and electric field profile in a three - terminal accumulation mode transistor , including field- and temperature dependent effective mobility , and field- and temperature dependent contact properties .",
    "this general problem is very complex@xcite ; here we consider a simpler model and compare with the transport data .    in a system that is",
    "not contact limited , when the effective mobility varies as a function of electric field @xmath44 , the space - charge limited current in a _ two - terminal _ device ( a 1d model ) is determined by the numerical solution of @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the local hole density , @xmath47 , and the appropriate boundary condition on @xmath48 . for approximately ohmic contacts , @xmath49 .",
    "we note that the case of an effective mobility that varies as @xmath50 and ohmic contacts has been solved@xcite , and that the exact numerical solution is very well approximated by : @xmath51 .",

    "@xmath53 is the channel length , @xmath52 is an effective cross - sectional area for the device ( proportional to channel width ) , and @xmath54 is the relative dielectic constant of the semiconductor ( chosen to be 3 in our analysis ) .",
    "the appearance of @xmath55 in this equation does not imply that the electric field is constant over the device length .",
    "rather , eq .  [ eq : sclpf ] suggests a means of plotting @xmath4 data to quickly ascertain consistency with the detailed numerical solution to the two - terminal sclpf problem .",
    "note that @xmath32 can depend on temperature ; in a picture of hopping it should be proportional to the effective dols at the injecting contact .",
    "the dependence of mobility on @xmath56 has long been seen in semiconducting and conducting polymers@xcite , and is associated with the charge carriers and disorder in these materials@xcite . the numerical solution of ref .",
    "@xcite ( approximated by eq .",
    "[ eq : sclpf ] ) should be valid as long as the functional form of the field - dependent mobility remains @xmath56 .",
    "this equation is derived@xcite assuming that the charge distribution is determined by source - drain electrostatics only .",
    "the electric field from the gate certainly plays a nontrivial role in our devices , clearly affecting charge injection , and allowing the formation of a channel at higher temperatures ( since any charge present in the channel below dopant freeze - out has to be injected from the source and drain ) . for simplicity",
    ", however , in this model we will assume that the gate dependence will manifest itself through @xmath32 , and that for fixed gate voltage we may treat the source - drain conductance like a two - terminal device .",
    "figure  [ fig : sclpf]a shows a representative log - log plot of @xmath13 vs. @xmath15 for one sample with @xmath57  nm and @xmath58  v , for several temperatures .",

    "( [ eq : sclpf ] ) . the quality of this agreement between the sclpf model and the data in several devices over a broad range of @xmath1 , @xmath14 , and @xmath43 is striking . clearly for a given ( large ) @xmath14 and ( low )",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath61 .",
    "alternate explanations of the nonlinear conduction are strongly constrained by this dependence .",
    "the temperature and gate voltage range over which this form of source - drain nonlinearity occurs varies systematically with sample size , as described below .",
    "one must consider whether the nonlinear @xmath62 characteristics result from nonlinear contact resistances as the temperature is decreased . for several reasons ,",
    "discussed below , we do not believe this to be the case .",
    "first we consider directly inferring the contact and channel resistances ( @xmath3 and @xmath63 , respectively ) in the linear regime , and examining the temperature variation of their relative contributions . for a series of devices with fixed width",
    ", these resistances are calculated as follows@xcite : at a given @xmath1 , the total resistance , @xmath64 , is calculated for each device at a small @xmath15 and is plotted as a function of @xmath53 for each gate voltage .",
    "the channel resistance per unit length , @xmath65 , at a given @xmath1 and @xmath14 is the slope ( @xmath66 ) of such a graph , and the intercept ( @xmath67 extrapolated to @xmath68 ) gives the parasitic series resistance , @xmath3 .    for a fixed - aspect - ratio series of devices",
    ", one may follow an analogous procedure . the total source - drain resistance @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the resistance per square of the channel .",
    "at a given @xmath1 and @xmath14 , @xmath71 is plotted versus @xmath53 for the series of devices .",
    "the slope of such a graph gives @xmath70 , and the intercept gives the total parasitic contact resistivity , @xmath72 .",
    "this analysis is shown in the fixed - aspect - ratio devices in fig .",
    "[ fig : olddatarvsl ] at room temperature for several gate voltages . for our geometry of @xmath73",
    ", the inset shows the inferred @xmath74 as a function of @xmath14 , for a device with @xmath75 m .",
    "_ our series of fixed - aspect - ratio devices is clearly channel - limited at room temperature . _",
    "this analysis may be repeated at different temperatures to examine the evolution of @xmath3 and @xmath63 .",
    "we find that the nonlinear conduction at large average source - drain fields shown in the previous section makes this difficult to measure over a broad temperature range in the fixed - aspect - ratio device series .",
    "however , the fixed - width devices with longer channel lengths are well - suited to this approach down to 100  k. figure  [ fig : rsrchvst ] shows @xmath74 as a function of temperature for the @xmath76 m device from the @xmath10 m series .",
    "near room temperature , @xmath77 for this device .",
    "as @xmath1 decreases , while both @xmath3 and @xmath78 increase significantly , @xmath3 falls below @xmath63 near 100  k. the results of this experiment and others to be published elsewhere@xcite demonstrate that the contact contributions become _ less _ important at low temperatures .",
    "this strongly suggests that the nonlinearities in the @xmath62 curves of short channel length devices observed at lower temperatures are unlikely to be contact effects .",
    "furthermore , the trends in transport with sample dimensions also support this conclusion .",
    "we find at low temperatures that the smallest devices actually transport charge considerably _",
    "better _ than larger devices . for example , at 50  k for fixed @xmath43 , the fixed - aspect - ratio @xmath28  nm device exhibits measurable conduction for gate voltages as small as -25  v , while the @xmath79 m device requires @xmath80  v. this trend is the _ opposite _ of what one would expect for contact - limited conduction@xcite . since @xmath19 is held constant in this set of devices , shorter channel devices have significantly smaller contact areas as well , further emphasizing this point .",
    "the data are , however , consistent with the suggestion of space charge effects seen in 70  nm channel length p3ht fets@xcite . finally , the voltage and temperature dependence of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : sclpf ] is not consistent with the forms for either classical schottky contacts or fowler - nordheim emission .",
    "detailed theory@xcite and experiments@xcite on injection into disordered polymer semiconductors show that injection efficiency can actually _ improve _ as temperature is decreased , consistent with our contact resistance data described above . coupled with the size dependence ,",
    "this supports the idea that low temperature transport in our devices is _ bulk _ limited rather than contact limited .",
    "continuing within the sclpf model and our analysis of the fixed - aspect - ratio devices , we note that , for identical effective mobilities and @xmath60 parameters , eq .  [ eq : sclpf ] implies that two samples with the same aspect ratio , thickness , and average source - drain field should give the same currents , independent of channel length , even deep in the nonlinear regime .",
    "device - to - device variability in the effective mobility and @xmath60 , presumably due to differences in p3ht thickness and microstructure , make this challenging to check directly in our devices . for reasonable values of @xmath60 and @xmath43 ,",
    "a 10% variation in @xmath60 would lead to more than a factor of 2 variation in predicted current at low temperatures because of the exponential dependence in eq .",
    "[ eq : sclpf ] .",
    "however , if one fixes @xmath43 and @xmath14 , and normalizes measured currents by room temperature mobilities , one does indeed find scaling .",
    "for example , the @xmath81  nm and @xmath75 m currents in the nonlinear regime normalized this way agree well all the way down to 10  k.    within this model , the parameter @xmath60 should depend only on the hopping mechanism ( _ e.g. _ thermal activation ) and the nature of the localized states .",
    "we therefore expect @xmath60 to be independent of gate voltage for a given sample , and this is indeed seen in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : slopet ] . at high temperatures (",
    "@xmath82  k ) , the data for all gate voltages and all samples look roughly linear in @xmath83 , consistent with thermally activated hopping .",
    "the magnitude of the slope of @xmath60 vs. @xmath83 is approximately 0.12  k(m / v)@xmath84 .",
    "this is consistent in magnitude with coefficients found in other semiconducting polymers such as poly(phenylene vinylene)@xcite .",
    "however , @xmath60 vs. @xmath83 deviates significantly from a straight line at lower temperatures for all samples .",
    "this is consistent with a crossover from thermally activated hopping to a much less steep temperature dependence .",
    "a natural candidate is field enhanced tunneling between the localized states .",
    "we now consider the gate and temperature dependence of the parameter @xmath59 found by the numerical analysis above . the effective cross - section for current flow , @xmath52 , is assumed to be temperature and gate voltage independent for each sample . in the linear regime at moderate temperatures it is known that the mobility inferred from the transconductance is gate voltage dependent , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mobt ] .",
    "this dependence on @xmath14 continues in the apparent sclpf regime , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intvgt]a on an @xmath85  nm device .",
    "the amount of variation of @xmath32 with @xmath14 , roughly a 5% increase of @xmath32 per volt of @xmath14 for this sample , shows no strong trend with temperature .",
    "the magnitude of this variation of mobility with @xmath14 is consistent with that seen at higher temperatures in fig .",
    "[ fig : mobt ] for this sample .",
    "this exponential dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath14 is seen throughout the apparent sclpf regime . as in the linear regime of an accumulation fet ,",
    "gate voltage modulation of the conduction is _ unipolar _ : higher currents result only when @xmath14 is made more negative .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath32 is also very strong , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intvgt]b for the same 300  nm channel sample at five gate voltages .",
    "the variation of @xmath86 shown is much closer to an exponential in @xmath1 to some slightly sublinear power rather than an arrhenius or vrh form .",
    "this strong temperature dependence of @xmath32 holds for all samples in the apparent sclpf regime .",
    "the strongly energy dependent dols employed in , for example , the vissenberg model offers a natural explanation for these steep dependences of @xmath32 on @xmath14 and @xmath1 . in the absence of any gate effect ,",
    "the _ effective _ density of localized states available for hopping transport at some temperature @xmath1 is given by @xmath87 where energy is measured from the band edge .",
    "an exponential dols of the vissenberg model would then lead to an exponential dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath1 .",
    "gate voltage dependence in this case comes from electrostatic modulation of the fermi level in this rapidly varying dols .",
    "it is difficult to understand otherwise how an exponential dependence of the prefactor on @xmath1 or @xmath14 could arise .",
    "deriving a quantitative relationship between @xmath14 and the local fermi level would require solving the full electrostatic problem of scplf conduction in the presence of the transverse gate field .",
    "one can consider whether the proposed sclpf conduction is a _ bulk _ process or one dominated by conduction in the thin channel layer active in standard fet operation .",
    "for the sclpf mobility parameter @xmath32 to coincide with the zero field mobility found at high temperatures in the linear regime , an effective cross - sectional area @xmath52 considerably larger than @xmath88 a few nanometers is required .",
    "this is also true for the data of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a considerably different device geometry was used , if analyzed using the sclpf model .",
    "however , the model of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coupled]),([eq : pflike ] ) does not account for the presence of a gate electrode or complicated source and drain geometries , and full computational modeling in this regime may be required to quantitatively account for this .",
    "one test for bulk vs. channel conduction would be to search for a correlation between p3ht thickness and currents in the apparent scl regime .",
    "this investigation is ongoing .",
    "for a series of field effect devices with channel lengths ranging from 3  @xmath0 m to 200  nm , we find gate modulated nonlinear conduction at low temperatures and high average source - drain electric fields .",
    "analysis of channel and contact resistances as a function of temperature , and the dependence of conduction on sample size at low temperatures support the conclusion that this nonlinearity is unlikely to be a contact effect .",
    "we find that the data are well described by a model of gate modulated space - charge limited currents with poole - frenkel - like behavior of mobility . within this model ,",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath1 dependence of the mobility prefactor is consistent with a very strongly energy dependent density of localized states .",
    "finally , the temperature dependence of the poole - frenkel - like term within this model suggests a crossover from thermal hopping to quantum tunneling at low temperatures .",
    "further studies of the field effect electrostatics problem , the metal - semiconductor contacts , and the low temperature nonthermal hopping process should lead to increased understanding of the conduction processes at work in these materials .",
