    "hyperchaotic attractors are characterized by at least two positive les and are considered to be much more complex in terms of topological structure and dynamics compared to low dimensional chaotic attractors . in the last one decade or so , hyperchaotic systems have attracted increasing attention from various scientific and engineering communities due to a large number of practical applications .",
    "these include secure communication and cryptography @xcite , synchronistion studies using electro - optic devices @xcite and as a model for chemical reaction chains @xcite . in all these applications",
    ", the complexity of the underlying attractor has a major role to play .",
    "though the concept of hyperchaos was introduced many years ago by rssler @xcite , a systematic understanding of the topological and fractal structure of the attractors generated from the hyperchaotic systems is lacking till date .",
    "studies in this direction have been very few except a series of papers by kapitaniak et al .",
    "@xcite in which the authors have discussed many aspects of the structure and transition to hyperchaos using a system of unidirectionally coupled oscillators as a model .",
    "hyperchaotic attractors are , in general , higher dimensional with the fractal dimension @xmath0 and trajectories diverging in at least two directions as the system evolves in time .",
    "hence the detection of hyperchaos is generally done using the les with the transition to hyperchaos marked by the crossing of the second largest le above zero .",
    "one of our aims in this paper is to try and get a more quantitative information regarding the structure of the hyperchaotic attractor in terms of the spectra of dimensions and use this information to detect the transition to hyperchaos .",
    "recently , we have done a detailed dimensional analysis @xcite of several standard hyperchaotic models and have established some results which are common to all these systems . for example , we have shown that the topological structure of the underlying attractor changes suddenly as the system makes a transition from chaos to hyperchaos and the attractor becomes a network of local clusters combined together to form the global structure .",
    "further , the attractor develops fractal structure at two seperate range of scales , with different fractal dimensions corresponding to intra cluster scaling and inter - cluster scaling . here",
    "we first show that the hyperchaotic attractor is a multifractal corresponding to the two length scales mentioned above with distinct @xmath1 spectra .",
    "in other words , the overall fractal structure of a hyperchaotic attractor can be characterized by two superposed @xmath1 spectrums .",
    "it is well known that , unlike ideal fractals , real world systems and limited point sets exhibit self similarity only over a finite range of scales @xcite .",
    "thus in the present case , statistical self similarity and hence the multifractal behavior changes between two finite range of scales .",
    "multifractality is commonly related to a probability measure that can have different fractal dimensions on different parts of the support of this measure .",
    "many authors have discussed the standard multifractal approach in detail @xcite and we briefly summarise the main results below for a point set ( such as , an attractor generated by a chaotic system ) .",
    "let the attractor be partitioned into @xmath2 dimensional cubes of side @xmath3 , with @xmath4 being the number of cubes required to cover the attractor . if @xmath5 is the probability that the trajectory passes through the @xmath6 cube , then @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of points in the @xmath6 cube and @xmath9 the total number of points on the attractor .",
    "we now assume that @xmath5 satisfies a scaling relation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the scaling index for the @xmath6 cube .",
    "we now ask how many cubes have the same scaling index @xmath11 or have scaling index within @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( if @xmath12 is assumed to vary continuously ) .",
    "let this number , say @xmath14 , scales with @xmath3 as @xmath15 where @xmath1 is a characteristic exponent",
    ". obviously , @xmath1 behaves as a dimension and can be interpreted as the fractal dimension for the set of points with scaling index @xmath12 .",
    "this also implies that the attractor can be characterized by a spectrum of dimensions normally denoted by @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 can , in principle , vary from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ) @xcite , that can be related to @xmath1 through a legendre transformation @xcite . the plot of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath12 gives a one hump curve with maximum corresponding to @xmath20 , the simple box counting dimension of the attractor .",
    "note that , in the above arguement , the scaling exponent @xmath12 measures how fast the number of points within a box decreases as @xmath3 is reduced .",
    "it therefore measures _ the strength of a singularity _ for @xmath21 . for a realistic attractor , with limited number of data points ,",
    "the limit @xmath21 is not accessible and hence one chooses a suitable scaling region for @xmath3 to compute @xmath12 and @xmath1 .",
    "correlation dimension computed using modified box counting scheme for three different hyperchaotic time series .",
    "the top panel shows the scaling region for computing @xmath22 for ( a ) the chen hyperchaotic flow ( b ) the m - g system and ( c ) the ikeda system .",
    "each curve is for an embedding dimension @xmath2 that varies from 1 to 10 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the variation of @xmath22 with @xmath2 for the three cases . ]",
    "this is where a hyperchaotic attractor becomes different from an ordinary chaotic attractor , as per our numerical results .",
    "we find that , to characterize the multifractal structure of a hyperchaotic attractor , two seperate scaling regions are to be considered corresponding to two length scales , say , @xmath3 and @xmath23 .",
    "the former represents the covering of trajectory points within clusters by boxes at very small length scales and @xmath12 represents how fast the points in these boxes decrease with @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , the latter represents the covering of the clusters within the whole attractor and the corresponding @xmath12 represents how fast the cluster of points decrease as @xmath23 is reduced . in both cases ,",
    "the scaling is different at different parts of the attractor , leading to multifractality .",
    "we present the numerical results in the next section .",
    "it should be noted that such _",
    "multiscales _ exhibited by multifractals have recently become an interesting area of research and have been discussed in various contexts .",
    "for example , the importance of multiscale multifractal analysis ( mma ) has been demonstrated in the study of human heart rate variability time series @xcite , where the multifractal properties of the measured signal depends on the time scale of fluctuations or the frequency band .",
    "also , multiscale multifractal intermittent turbulence in space plasmas has been investigated in the time series of velocities of solar wind plasma @xcite .",
    "but the most interesting example of a real world system that shows multifractal structure at distinct length scales is the distribution of galaxies in the observable universe , which we discuss in detail in  v.    top panel shows the @xmath16 values ( points ) and its best fit curve ( continuous line ) of the m - g attractor for @xmath24 ( in the chaotic phase ) , calculated from a time series consisting of @xmath25 data points with @xmath26 .",
    "the lower panel shows the @xmath1 spectrum computed from the best fit curve . ]",
    "the specific information regarding the structure of the hyperchaotic attractor provides the possibility of generating hyperchaos by coupling two chaotic attractors , a result already shown in the literature . here",
    "we present a general scheme for this to get both hyperchaos and high dimensional chaos by varying a control parameter .",
    "finally , we generate the dual multifractal structure both synthetically and as models of real world distribution .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we discuss the details of numerical computations of the multifractal spectrum to show how the structure of a hyperchaotic attractor varies from that of an ordinary chaotic attractor .",
    "this result is utilized for the generation of hyperchaos by coupling two chaotic attractors , whose details are given in  iii . in  iv and  v , we present two examples to show that the dual multifractal structure is possible in structures other than hyperchaos . while the first one is a cantor set generated using a specific scheme , the second one is an example from the real world which confirms that such a structure really exists in nature .",
    "the paper is concluded in ",
    "we now present our main results by computing the generalized dimensions @xmath16 and the @xmath1 spectrum of the hyperchaotic attractor from time series .",
    "we use the time series from three standard hyperchaotic systems for computation , namely , the chen hyperchaotic flow @xcite , the mackey - glass ( m - g ) time delayed system @xcite and the ikeda time delayed system @xcite . for the hyperchaotic flow ,",
    "we fix the parameters as studied in detail in @xcite @xmath27 to generate the hyperchaotic time series . for m - g and ikeda systems",
    ", we use the time delay @xmath28 as the control parameter with the other parameters fixed as @xmath29 for m - g and @xmath30 for ikeda respectively .",
    "we have studied the transition to hyperchaos in these two time delayed systems in detail @xcite and here we choose @xmath31 for m - g and @xmath32 for ikeda for generating the hyperchaotic time series .    before going into the computation of the multifractal spectrum",
    ", we discuss very briefly our results on @xmath22 obtained using the modified box counting scheme @xcite , where the scaling region for computing @xmath22 is fixed algorithmically . in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] ( top panel ) , we show the scaling region computed by the scheme for the above three systems in the hyperchaotic phase . here , the weighted box counting sum @xmath33 @xcite is plotted against box size @xmath3 .",
    "each curve corresponds to an embedding dimension @xmath2 , which varies from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "two scaling regions ( denoted i and ii ) are evident in all cases , for @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath22 values computed from the two scaling regions as a function of @xmath2 are also shown in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "it has been shown numerically that the dual scaling regions are a consequence of the attractor breaking up into a large number of clusters at the transition to hyperchaos .",
    "thus , the region i represents scaling within the clusters with high value of @xmath22 ( say , @xmath37 ) and region ii corresponds to inter - cluster scaling with comparatively lower @xmath22 value @xmath38 .",
    "we now show that the hyperchaotic attractor not only has two @xmath22 values , but the entire spectrum of @xmath16 and the associated @xmath1 spectrum corresponding to the two different range of scales . in other words ,",
    "the nature of statistical self similarity changes ( as the range of scales varies ) from intra cluster to inter - cluster .",

    "same as the previous figure for m - g and ikeda systems . ]    to compute the @xmath16 and the @xmath1 spectrum from the time series , we use the automated algorithmic scheme proposed by us recently @xcite .",
    "a brief discussion of the scheme is given below which is based on the grassberger - procaccia ( g - p ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "as the first step , the spectrum of generalised dimensions @xmath16 is computed from the time series using the equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the generalised correlation sum .",
    "this is done by choosing the scaling region algorithmically as discussed earlier @xcite .",
    "we then use an entirely different algorithmic approach for the computation of the smooth profile of the @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "the @xmath1 function is a single valued function between @xmath42 and @xmath43 and also has to satisfy several other conditions , such as , it has a single maximum and @xmath44 .",
    "a simple function that can satisfy all the necessary conditions is @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath43 and @xmath42 are a set of parameters characterizing a particular @xmath1 curve .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that only four of these parameters are independent and any general @xmath1 curve can be fixed by four independent parameters . moreover , by imposing the conditions on the @xmath1 curve , it can also be shown that @xmath49 .",
    "the scheme first takes @xmath50 and @xmath51 as input parameters from the computed @xmath16 values and choosing an initial value for @xmath47 in the range @xmath52 $ ] , the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath46 are calculated .",
    "the @xmath1 curve is then computed in the range @xmath53 $ ] . from this , a smooth @xmath16 versus @xmath17 curve can be obtained by inverting using the legendre transformation equations , which is then fitted to the @xmath16 spectrum derived from the time series .",
    "the parameter values are changed continuously until the @xmath16 curve matches with the @xmath16 spectrum from the time series and the statistically best fit @xmath16 curve is chosen . from this , the final @xmath1 curve can be evaluated .    to illustrate the scheme , we first compute the @xmath16 values and the associated @xmath1 spectrum for the m - g attractor in the chaotic phase for @xmath24 with embedding dimension @xmath26 .",

    "the @xmath16 values ( points)and the best fit curve ( continuous line ) are shown in the upper panel while the associated @xmath1 spectrum computed from the best fit curve is shown in the lower panel .",
    "we now apply the scheme to the hyperchaotic attractors and compute the @xmath16 and the @xmath1 spectrum for the two scaling regions seperately , by fixing @xmath54 and @xmath55 for scaling region i ( ii )",

    "our results indicate that the fractal structure of a hyperchaotic attractor is much more complex compared to that of an ordinary chaotic attractor with a superposition of multifractals .",
    "the result that a hyperchaotic attractor is a superposition of two multifractals provides us with a possibility for constructing a hyperchaotic system by coupling two chaotic systems .",
    "there are already a few papers in the literature where the authors propose the construction of a hyperchaotic system either by coupling two chaotic systems @xcite or by introducing a time delayed transformation @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that in some cases , even the coupling is not required ; just an amalgam of two chaotic attractors can sometimes become hyperchaotic @xcite , which strongly supports our results .",
    "this method is applied in the synchronization studies by multiplexing two chaotic signals @xcite . here",
    "we consider the prospect of generating hyperchaos by coupling any two regular chaotic systems and study under what conditions and coupling schemes one can achieve this .    the coupling of two chaotic systems is more generally employed in the synchronization studies @xcite rather than hyperchaos generation where the coupling strength has to be sufficiently high . here",
    "we consider two individual chaotic systems evolving at two different time scales coupled together .",
    "the general scheme that we propose is given by @xmath57 here @xmath58 @xmath59 with @xmath60 representing the intrinsic dynamics of the two systems and @xmath61 denoting the coupling function .",
    "the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent the coupling strengths between the two systems and the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the two time scale parameters indicating that the two systems are evolving at two different time scales . without loss of generality , we can take @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    the two individual systems @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be any two low dimensional chaotic systems , identical or different .",
    "we have done a detailed numerical analysis taking some standard low dimensional chaotic systems , such as , lorenz , rssler and ueda as individual systems with @xmath70 and @xmath71 identical as well as different .",

    "the parameter @xmath76 should be sufficiently small @xmath77 in order to avoid the synchronization of the dynamics between the two systems and the ampllitude death @xcite .",
    "we vary the value of @xmath76 in the range @xmath78 to @xmath79",
    ". the time step of integration @xmath80 should be sufficiently small to capture the small scale properties of the hyperchaotic attractor and hence we fix the value of @xmath81 in our numerical simulations .",
    "our control parameter is @xmath82 .",
    "we have found that hyperchaos can be generated in all the different coupling schemes mentioned above for a range of values of @xmath82 depending on the individual systems , nature of coupling and strength of coupling .    to show the above results explicitly , we consider two specific cases . in the first case ,",

    "the result is again a chaotic attractor , but with dimension higher than the individual systems @xmath89 , resulting in high dimensional chaos . in between , for a range of values of @xmath82 , the resulting attractor",
    "is found to display hyperchaotic behavior . in fig .",
    "[ f.5 ] , we show the results for two values of @xmath82 , namely , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the former being hyperchaotic and the latter chaotic as reflected by the change in the scaling regions for the two cases .",

    "our results indicate that the underlying dynamics can be hyperchaotic or high dimensional chaotic depending on the value of the time scale parameter @xmath82 .",
    "the second case we show is a mutual diffusive coupling between the standard lorenz and rssler chaotic attractors given by @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 . here",
    "again we find that the resulting attractor is hyperchaotic for a range of intermediate values of @xmath82 and two typical cases , one hyperchaotic and the other high dimensional chaotic , are shown in fig .",

    "<S> finally , to show the existence of such structures , we present two examples - one synthetically generated set of points in the unit interval and the other representing a distribution in the real world - both displaying dual multifractal spectrum .    * the concept of hyperchaos was introduced by rssler to represent higher complexity compared to chaos , with at least two directions of stretching during the evolution of a chaotic system . </S>",
    "<S> though the idea initially started as a theoretical curiosity , the interest in the study of hyperchaotic systems increased in the last one decade or so due to a large number of practical applications , many of these involving the structural complexity of hyperchaotic attractors . in this paper , we undertake a detailed multifractal analysis of different classes of hyperchaotic systems and present numerical evidence that a hyperchaotic attractor is not a simple multifractal , but involves dual spectra . we also illustrate that such structures can be generated synthetically as well as present in the real world . * </S>"
