    "this mechanism is examined in detail through simulation of the collision of hydrogen atoms with graphene as one of the fundamental processes in plasma  carbon interaction .",

    "quantum mechanical simulations could not be performed for the same time of interaction using the resources available .",
    "a new model potential between hydrogen and graphene is introduced for these simulations in order to incorporate brenner s rebo potential [ @xcite ] as the basis for the chemical reaction .",
    "the carbon wall is treated as graphene layers which are minimal structure of both a graphite and a carbon fiber . however , for simplification , they do not inter - layer interaction .",
    "the kinetic energy of incident hydrogen is set to less than 100  ev to facilitate comparison with the results of divertor experiments .",
    "the interaction potential in cmd has been developed through contributions by many theorists [ @xcite-@xcite ] .",

    "if chemical reactions occur , the rebo potential breaks energy conservation . to deal with chemical reactions , new functions expressing conjugation effects",

    "incident hydrogen atoms arrive normal to the graphenes from the @xmath21   .",
    "the simulation continues until the incident atom is reflected , the atom leaves the graphenes into the @xmath22 region , or until the atom becomes trapped by the graphenes .",
    "a total of 200 simulations was performed for each graphene temperature and incident energy , with the initial position of the hydrogen atom on the @xmath21    plane varied randomly to obtain statistical information .",
    "the present cmd simulation satisfies the constant - volume - energy ( nve ) condition .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the present simulations of incident hydrogen energies @xmath23 of less than 100  ev , the hydrogen atoms were found to be absorbed ( or reflected ) by the graphenes without destroying the graphenes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) , the simulations suggest that the hydrogen adsorption rate on graphene is independent of the graphene temperature . this result is not consistent with experimental facts[@xcite ] .",
    "however , the temperature defined in this simulation ( @xmath24 ) is not the same as the temperature measured in experiments ( @xmath25 ) due to the omission of inter - layer interaction in the present simulation .",
    "the graphenes form a domain structure by the inter - layer interaction in the carbon wall .",
    "the experimental temperature @xmath25 therefore includes all the kinetic energy of the relative motion of each domain , each layer , and each atom , whereas @xmath24 accounts solely for the kinetic energy of atoms .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1](b ) shows that the hydrogen adsorption rate is dependent on @xmath23 .",
    "the mechanism of adsorption can be classified into the following three types of processes :    * adsorption at @xmath26  ev : * as the incident hydrogen atom approaches the graphene , the nearest carbon atom overhangs spontaneously from the flat graphene ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) ) . because , this deformation of the graphene leads the total potential energy to the minimum point ( arrow 1 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) ) . the kinetic energy converted from potential energy",
    "is diffused into the entire atoms in the graphene through the overhanging carbon atom .",
    "the incident atom thus loses kinetic energy and is trapped .    *",
    "reflection at @xmath27  ev  @xmath28  ev : * the velocity of the incident atom is so high under high - energy conditions that spontaneous overhanging of the carbon atom can not occur , and the total potential does not pass through the minimum point .",
    "the incident atom bounces off this potential barrier ( arrow 2 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) ) and the incident atom is reflected .",
    "the adsorption rate under such conditions is therefore low .    * penetration at @xmath29  ev : * when the energy @xmath23 is greater than the potential barrier , the incident atom penetrates the graphene ( arrow 3 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) ) .",
    "the incident atom gradually loses kinetic energy by repulsion of the carbon atom as it penetrating several graphene layers .",
    "the reaction thus eventually changes into a reflection process .",
    "after repeated bouncing between graphene layers , the incidence atom is trapped .",
    "the collision processes between incident hydrogen and graphene at energies of less than 100  ev were investigated by cmd simulations using a modified rebo potential .",
    "it was found that hydrogen does not destroy the graphene at these energies , but is instead absorbed or reflected by the graphene .",
    "the rate of hydrogen adsorption was shown to be dependent on the incident energy and not on the graphene temperature .",
    "the collision behavior was classified into the three processes ; absorption of hydrogen in graphene ( @xmath26  ev ) , reflection by graphene ( @xmath27  ev @xmath28  ev ) , and penetration through one or more graphenes ( @xmath29  ev ) .",
