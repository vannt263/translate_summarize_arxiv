    "the description of hard - core fluids by approximate theories has attracted a lot of attention throughout the years @xcite .",
    "the reason for this interest is twofold : firstly a solution of the full problem was , and still is , extremely difficult .",
    "secondly , approximate methods have allowed for very good predictions in the low density phase . among the most widely used approximations",

    "leutheusser used this method to reduce the nonlinear integral py equation to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations of order @xmath1 ( for @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "however , this set of equations can only be solved analytically for odd @xmath3 . in general , even the numerical solution of leutheusser s equations is difficult to obtain for higher dimensions because a general solution to nonlinear algebraic equations of order larger than four is not available .",
    "analytical results have been found for one @xcite , three @xcite , five @xcite and , most recently , seven dimensions @xcite .    in two dimensions",
    "an approximate numerical solution of the py equation was found by lado  @xcite .",
    "leutheusser @xcite was able to fit many of lado s results using an ansatz for the direct correlation function .",
    "rosenfeld @xcite generalized leutheusser s ansatz to higher dimensions and compared the results with the analytical results in three and five dimensions .",
    "all other results available in the literature are based on molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo ( mc ) methods @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we solve the py equation for hard discs ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we develop a method that reduces the problem to a set of integral equations that are solved numerically without major difficulties .",
    "the originality of the present method is based on techniques borrowed from the resolution of crack problems @xcite and uses some results from baxter s classical method  @xcite .",
    "the main difference from the hard sphere case ( and any odd dimension in general ) is that the problem of finding the indirect correlation function and the direct correlation function are coupled .",
    "this means that the present analysis necessarily yields both correlation functions and therefore provides the equation of state .",
    "note that lado  @xcite solved the problem using approximate integral equations , in contrast to our exact integral equations .",
    "the advantage of the current method is that one can improve the precision at will , and that it may be generalized to higher even dimensions .",
