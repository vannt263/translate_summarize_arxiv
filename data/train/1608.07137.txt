    "the study of quantum dipolar gases has attracted much experimental and theoretical interest in the last decade , since pioneering works where trapped clouds of @xmath0cr atoms , brought close to a broad feshbach resonance , revealed clear evidences of condensate deformation  @xcite . after these initial experiments , new perspectives with other species with much larger dipolar moments were explored . in this line",
    ", polar molecules of and rb  @xcite , or cs and rb  @xcite , with much stronger dipolar interactions , seemed to be the optimal candidates .",
    "however , it turned out to be very difficult to keep them in the quantum degeneracy limit due to three - body losses and chemical reactions .",
    "still , an important progress has been recently achieved with nak  @xcite and narb  @xcite molecules . in much the same way , new magnetic dipolar condensates of dy",
    "@xcite and er  @xcite species have been produced , allowing for a much cleaner measurement of quantum dipolar physics due to the absence of most of the problems found when dealing with polar molecules .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "the anisotropic and long - ranged character of the dipolar interaction makes these systems unique , exhibiting new features like @xmath1-wave superfluidity in two - dimensional fermi gases  @xcite or roton instabilities  @xcite , that enrich the phase diagram when compared with other condensed matter systems governed by van der waals forces .",
    "more recently , the formation of solid structures of droplets of trapped dipolar bosons brought to the regime of mean - field collapse has also attracted much attention , both from the experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite points of view .",
    "an appealing setup which permits to avoid the collapse of the system is the bilayer , or even the multilayer .",
    "for instance , in the case of fermi dipoles it has been shown that the bilayer geometry produces a non - zero superfluid signal that , depending on the interlayer distance , is due either to bcs pairs or to tightly bound molecules in a bec state  @xcite .",
    "the bosonic counterpart of this problem has also been studied , revealing for the first time a homogeneous bose system that undergoes a quantum phase transition from a single - particle to a pair superfluid with decreasing interlayer distance  @xcite .",
    "the interlayer separation in a bilayer ( or multilayer ) geometry introduces a potential barrier that helps to stabilize the system , reducing the effects induced by three - body loses , a fact that can be particularly relevant in the case of polar molecules  @xcite .",
    "this allows a tunable transition to a superfluid of dimers in the bose case , strongly modifying the many - body properties of the system .",
    "these effects are seen both in the ground state and elementary excitations , which are governed by a delicate balance between the intra- and inter - layer interactions . in a recent work",
    "@xcite , the elementary excitation spectrum at finite temperature of an arrangement of dipoles in a bilayer geometry has been analyzed .    in the present work ,",
    "we perform a microscopic calculation of the dynamic response of the bilayer system at zero temperature .",
    "our results rely on the use the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method in combination with the correlated basis function ( cbf ) theory .",
    "the cbf - dmc combination has proved useful for dipolar quantum gases  @xcite , but also for molecule dynamics in @xmath2he droplets  @xcite .",
    "we consider a system of dipoles with moments oriented perpendicularly to the two planes where they are allowed to move .",
    "the bilayer setup offers the somehow unique opportunity of realizing a bose gas with a gapped spectrum , so we pay special attention to the spin - channel excitations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] , we introduce the model and the methods used in the study , i.e. , the dmc method and the cbf theory adapted to the bilayer geometry . results for the density and spin dynamic responses are reported in sec .",

    "the ground - state properties of the system , described by the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , can be efficiently calculated by means of the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method .",
    "dmc solves stochastically the @xmath17-body schrdinger equation in imaginary time and provides not only the energy and static properties , but also correlation functions in imaginary time . for a bose system like the present one ,",
    "dmc is an exact method , constrained by statistical noise which , on the other hand , can be accurately estimated .",
    "we use the same number of particles , time steps , guiding wave function , and other technical parameters as in ref .",

    "our main goal is the study of the excitations of the bilayer system .",

    "as it is well known , calculation of the inverse laplace transform required to obtain the dynamic response from the intermediate scattering function @xmath28 is a mathematically ill - conditioned problem . at the practical level",
    ", this means that the always - present finite accuracy of the input data makes it impossible to find a unique reconstruction of the dynamic structure factor . among the techniques devised specifically to get a better signal for the dynamic response we used a stochastic optimization approach .",

    "it was shown in ref .",

    ", we observe an low - energy spectrum of phonon - type , both in the density and spin channels .",
    "in particular , the spin response goes linearly to zero when @xmath130 .",
    "the energy spectrum for the density response has a roton , albeit a shallow one .",
    "the description changes dramatically when stable dimers ( pair superfluid ) form the ground - state configuration of the system .",
    "the change in the density mode is essentially quantitative ; it is still of phonon - roton type as expected , but with a much deeper roton minimum .",
    "the observation of rotons in dilute gases has been widely discussed and several proposal were made  @xcite . probably , one of the best setups for observing a significant roton in dilute systems would be the use of bilayer or multilayer stacks of dipolar bosons to produce effective dipolar moments much larger than in a single two - dimensional trap .",
    "the most dramatic change in the response upon dimerization is observed in the spin mode . in the pair - superfluid regime",
    "our calculations show unambiguously the presence of a gap of high energy , which for small interlayer separation coincides with half the binding energy of the dimer .",
    "whereas the existence of a gap in a superfluid fermi system due to the pairing mechanism is well known and understood , the observation of a gap mode in a bose gas is noticeable .",
    "hopefully , in the near future it will be possible to design bilayer setups with a tunable interlayer distance or with bosons with tunable dipole moments which can reach the pair - superfluid regime and , through bragg scattering  @xcite , observe the predicted gap .",
