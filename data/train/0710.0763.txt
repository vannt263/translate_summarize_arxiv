    "are described by the universal power law kolmogorov spectrum @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "this law depends neither on the energy injection nor on the energy dissipation processes .    in the solar wind , and in the interplanetary space in general , the mean free path roughly corresponds to the sun - earth distance and the usual dissipation via collisions is negligible . at the same time , in a magnetized plasma there is a number of characteristic space and temporal scales . investigating solar wind turbulence at these scales",
    "is then a challenging topic from the point of view of basic plasma physics . here",
    "we will focus our discussion on the ion scales , namely the ion inertial length @xmath6 and the ion cyclotron frequency @xmath7 . at these scales",
    "the fluid - like approximation of plasma dynamics , the usual magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) description , breaks down in favor of a more complex description of plasma .",
    "solar wind turbulent spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations follows a @xmath8 power law below the ion cyclotron frequency @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath9 the spectrum steepens significantly , but is still described by a power law @xmath10 , with @xmath11 @xcite .    _ in situ _ solar wind measurements provide time series data , i.e. information on frequency in fourier space .",
    "how to get any information on wave vectors ? for fluctuations with velocities much smaller than the plasma bulk velocity @xmath12 , the taylor hypothesis is valid : the observed variations on a time scale @xmath13 correspond to variations on the spatial scale @xmath14 .",
    "therefore there is a direct correspondence between @xmath15 and @xmath16 spectra .",
    "if the solar wind turbulence was a mixture of linear wave modes , taylor hypothesis would be well verified only below the spectral break : the bulk velocity is superalfvnic ( @xmath17 , where @xmath18 being the alfvn speed ) and so the low frequency fluctuations can be considered as frozen in plasma .",
    "however , whistler waves ( with @xmath19 and phase speed @xmath20 ) do not satisfy the taylor hypothesis assumption . in this study",
    "we assume that in the solar wind there are no whistler waves above the spectral break frequency .",
    "this last assumption is supported by results recently obtained in the earth s magnetosheath @xcite .    using the taylor hypothesis the observed solar wind spectrum below the break",
    "is usually attributed to the kolmogorov s spectrum @xmath21 . above the spectral break , the spectral steepening , @xmath22 ,",
    "can be interpreted in two different ways .",
    "some authors associate it to the dissipation range @xcite .",
    "others suggest that after the spectral break another turbulent cascade takes place @xcite .",
    "in ordinary fluid flows the dissipation range is described by an exponential function @xcite .",
    "while in the solar wind , a well - defined power law is observed after the break point and not an exponential .",
    "note that power spectra , i.e. the second order statistics , completely describe gaussian , or statistically independent , fluctuations .",
    "however , as is well known , fluctuations can not be described by a gaussian statistics in the low - frequency part of the solar wind turbulence @xcite .",
    "deviations from gaussianity , i.e. intermittency @xcite , may be quantified by the flatness , the forth - order moment of fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the nature of magnetic fluctuations in the high frequency range of the solar wind turbulence , that is usually called dissipation range .",
    "we find that in this range the flatness increase with frequency .",
    "this is similar to what is going on in the low - frequency range .",
    "the presence of intermittency together with the well defined power law in the high - frequency part of the spectrum suggests another turbulent cascade rather than a dissipation range .",
    "this small scale cascade is observed to be much more compressible than the kolmogorov - like inertial range , in agreement with the previous observations by the wind spacecraft @xcite .",
    "we show that the energy transfer rate and intermittency are sensitive to the level of compressibility of the turbulent fluctuations in this range .",
    "finally , we propose a simple phenomenological model , based on the compressible hall mhd , which allows to explain the observed range of the spectral indices in the high frequency part of the solar wind spectrum .",

    "the cluster fgm spectrum covers a @xmath64  hz frequency range , the lower resolved frequency here is determined by the length of the considered time period , 57 minutes , and by a cone of influence of the morlet wavelet transform @xcite .",

    ", the spectrum follows a @xmath66 law : the spectral index 2.6 lies in the usual observed range , between 2 and 4 @xcite .",
    "as regards the spectrum @xmath55 , it is remarkable , that after the spectral break , the compressible magnetic fluctuations become much more important than in the low frequency part of the spectrum .",
    "this can be quantified by the ratio @xmath67 , that is @xmath68 in the law frequency part and @xmath69 in the high frequency part of the spectrum .",
    "this means that nearly 30% of the magnetic fluctuations above the spectral break are compressible .",

    "the pdfs of the other components of the magnetic field present a similar behaviour .",

    "helios indicates an increase of the flatness and cluster / fgm shows a slight decrease",
    ". this disagreement can be due to ( i )  aliasing at the highest frequencies of helios ; ( ii )  artifacts on fgm at frequencies around the satellite spin frequency 0.25 hz ; or to some other physical reasons which are outside of the scope of the present paper . here",
    "we will focus our discussion on the higher frequencies , resolved by cluster / staff - sc , where the flatness again displays a power - law dependence on @xmath15 .",
    "this scaling behavior is inherent to non - linear dynamics and refers to a new kind of `` inertial region '' .    in non - magnetized fluid , a rapid exponential increase of the flatness",
    "is observed in the near - dissipation range since only the strongest fluctuations survive while the others are destroyed by viscosity @xcite .",
    "after such increase the flatness saturates . in our case , the saturation is not observed and there is a power law increase of flatness . at the same time",
    "strong coherent structures which give an important increase of intermittency represent only @xmath76 of the fluctuations at each scale ( see the insert of fig .",

    "local intermittency measure _ analysis .",
    "it consists in separating the intermittent events which participate to the non - gaussian tails of the pdf s from the gaussian fluctuations . at each scale @xmath46",
    "we chose a threshold @xmath77 for the energy of magnetic fluctuations and we select the wavelet coefficients which verify @xmath78 . with the new set of coefficients we recalculate the flatness ; if it is larger than 3 we decrease the threshold until the flatness reaches the gaussian value . at the end of the procedure",
    ", the fraction of the non - gaussian coefficients gives an estimate of the percentage of the intermittent structures at each scale .",
    "note , that this analysis only gives the upper limit of the structures because one intermittent event is described normally by more than one wavelet coefficient .",
    "the results described in the previous section suggest that above the spectral break frequency @xmath79 there is a non - linear compressible cascade and not a dissipation range . in this section",
    "we show that the level of the plasma compressibility in this range can be at the origin of a _ non - universality _ of statistics of the magnetic fluctuations . to show this we consider two @xmath80 min time periods on april 5 , 2001 , with different ion plasma @xmath81",

    "should be analyzed .",
    "how can we explain the small scale energy cascade in the solar wind turbulence , sensitive to the compressibility of the fluctuations ?",
    "there are several interpretations .",
    "following @xcite , at spatial scales between the ion and electron characteristic scales , there is a superposition of ( undamped ) kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) and entropy cascades .",
    "kaw waves are expected to have low frequencies @xmath90 and nearly perpendicular wave vectors with respect to the mean field , @xmath91 .",
    "another possible explanation of the small scale cascade is a superposition of non - linear fluctuations ( not waves ) , which exchange energy on times smaller than the usual eddy - turnover ( or non - linear ) time . at spatial scales at the order of @xmath31 and at frequencies of the order of @xmath1 one should take into account the hall effect in faraday s equation @xmath92 \\label{induzione}\\ ] ] @xmath93 being the current density and @xmath94 a scalar dissipation coefficient .",
    "this equation contains three different physical processes , with three associated characteristic times . by introducing for each length - scale @xmath95 the mean value of density @xmath96 , magnetic intensity @xmath97 and velocity @xmath98",
    ", we can define an eddy  turnover time @xmath99 , a characteristic time associated to the hall effect @xmath100 and a dissipative time @xmath101 . at large scales",
    "the main effect is played by the term @xmath102 , which describes the low - frequency alfvnic cascade @xcite realized in a time @xmath103 .",
    "we conjecture that approaching the scale of the spectral break , @xmath104 appears to be of the order of @xmath103 and beyond the break , the nonlinear energy transfer is realized in a time @xmath105 .    in a compressible fluid the energy balance equation",
    "must be expressed in terms of energy densities ( i.e. , energy per unit volume ) and not in terms of specific energy ( i.e. , per unit mass ) , in order to take into account density fluctuations ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "the mean volume rate of energy transfer on hall times in a compressible fluid is therefore @xmath106    assuming equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energies @xmath107 , the energy  transfer rate results to be proportional to @xmath108    following von weizscker ( 1951 ) , the ratio of the mass density @xmath109 at two successive levels of the hierarchy is related to the corresponding scale size @xmath95 by the following equation @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a measure of the degree of compression at each level @xmath112 ( larger @xmath112 meaning larger length - scale ) , and ranges from @xmath113 for no compression up to @xmath114 for isotropic compression ( @xmath115 is a number of dimensions in which the compression takes place ) .",
    "so , using this density scaling , @xmath116 , and assuming a constant spectrum energy transfer rate we have @xmath117 therefore , the spectral energy function is @xmath118    in the incompressible plasma limit ( @xmath113 ) , this phenomenology predicts a @xmath119 spectrum . such a spectrum has been observed both in direct numerical simulations of an incompressible electron mhd turbulent system @xcite and in the emhd limit of the incompressible hall mhd shell model @xcite .    in the case of isotropic compression toward smaller scales ( @xmath120 ) which can take place in the interstellar medium , the spectrum is @xmath121 .",
    "if the isotropic compression is going on toward larger scales ( @xmath122 ) the spectrum will be @xmath123 .",
    "in the case , analyzed here , the power law spectrum of magnetic fluctuations follows the @xmath124law , that corresponds to @xmath125 , i.e. , the scaling relation for the density is @xmath126 .",
    "this simple phenomenological model allows to explain the variations of the spectral index of the high frequency part of the solar wind spectrum from @xmath127 to @xmath128 by different degree of plasma compression with @xmath3 between @xmath129 and @xmath130",
    ".    however , the described model have to be improved in order to take into account ( i ) the space anisotropy ( @xmath131 ) that appears in a plasma with a mean field and ( ii ) possible different scaling for velocity and magnetic field which can be found in the compressible hall mhd @xcite . besides , the interpretation of the small scale energy cascade in the hall mhd frame is supported by the observations of a clear correlation between the spectral break frequency @xmath58 and the doppler - shifted wavevector of the ion inertia length @xmath132 ( leamon et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "note that the solar wind spectral break frequency @xmath58 is usually observed to be lower than @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "it can be explained by the fact that the hall effect starts acting at scales larger than @xmath31 . in our case , for example , @xmath133 and the scale of the spectral break is @xmath134 .    introducing the hall reynolds number as the ratio of the non - linear term over the hall term @xmath135",
    "one can see that @xmath136 ( i.e. @xmath137 ) at a scale @xmath95 , that is not necessarily equal to @xmath31 , @xmath138 here @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the mean values of the alfvn speed and the ion inertial length at scale @xmath95 respectively .",
    "in this paper we investigate small scales turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind ( i.e. at frequencies above the spectral break at the vicinity of @xmath1 ) . taking into account the taylor hypothesis ( @xmath141 ) the frequency domain above the spectral break covers @xmath142  km space scales that corresponds to @xmath143 . in this range",
    "we found evidences for strong departure from gaussian statistics and the presence of intermittency while the spectrum presents a well - defined power law .",
    "both the presence of a power - law spectrum and the absence of global self - similarity , seems to be quite in contrast with the role of  dissipative range \" .    in usual fluid turbulence ,",
    "the dissipative range @xcite starts with a rough exponential cutoff ; in the near dissipation range the intermittency increases as far as the gaussian fluctuations dissipate faster than the coherent structures @xcite ; then the fluctuations become self - similar , the singularities being smoothed by dissipation . in the solar wind turbulence we observe a completely different picture . after the spectral break in the vicinity of @xmath1",
    "the flatness increases as a power law indicating that non - linear interactions are at work to build up a new inertial range .",
    "this small scale cascade is much more compressible than the lower frequency alfvnic cascade .",
    "this sudden change in nature of the turbulent fluctuations can happen due to a partial dissipation of magnetic fluctuations at the spectral break : the left - hand alfvnic fluctuations with @xmath144 are damped by the ion - cyclotron damping @xcite . above the break , however , a new _ magnetosonic cascade _ takes place up to the electron characteristic scales .",
    "this energy cascade is seems to be dominated by the fluctuations with @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "we found , as well , that the plasma compressibility controls the statistics of the magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "preliminary results show that the increase of the level of the plasma compressibility leads to the spectrum steepening and increase of the intermittency .    to explain this small scale compressible cascade we introduce here for the first time a simple phenomenological model based on the compressible hall mhd : we find that the magnetic energy spectrum follows a @xmath146 law , depending on the degree of plasma compressibility @xmath3 . while far from a complete model of small scale turbulence , this simple model can explain observed variations of the spectral index within the high frequency part of the solar wind turbulent spectrum @xcite by different degree of plasma compressibility .",
