    "the spatial correlation function of clusters of galaxies and its richness dependence provide powerful tests of cosmological models : both the amplitude of the correlation function and its dependence on cluster mass / richness are determined by the underlying cosmology .",
    "it has long been shown that clusters are more strongly correlated in space than galaxies , by an order - of - magnitude : the typical galaxy correlation scale , @xmath1 5 @xmath2 mpc , increases to @xmath1 20 - 25 @xmath2 mpc for the richest clusters ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the cluster correlation function is richness dependent : the correlation strength increases with cluster richness , or mass .",
    "many observations have since confirmed these results ( references above ) , and theory has nicely explained them @xcite .",
    "but the uncertainties in the observed cluster correlation function as manifested by the scatter among different measurements remained large .",
    "in this paper we use the largest sample of clusters yet investigated , 1108 clusters selected from 379 deg@xmath0 of early sloan digital sky survey data ( see the sdss cluster catalog : @xcite ) , to determine the cluster correlation function . this large , complete sample of objectively selected clusters , ranging from poor to moderately rich systems in the redshift range @xmath10 = 0.1 - 0.3",
    ", allows a new determination of the cluster correlation function and its richness dependence .",
    "we compare the sdss cluster correlation function with results of previous optically and x - ray selected clusters (  [ correlation ] ) .",
    "we use large - scale cosmological simulations to compare the observational results with cosmological models (  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "the data are consistent with predictions from the standard flat lcdm model ( @xmath4@xmath10.3 , @xmath110.7 ) , which best fits numerous other observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) will provide a comprehensive digital imaging survey of 10@xmath12 deg@xmath0 of the north galactic cap ( and a smaller , deeper area in the south ) in five bands ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath10 ) to a limiting magnitude of @xmath1723 , followed by a spectroscopic multi - fiber survey of the brightest one million galaxies , to @xmath1717.7 , with a median redshift of @xmath180.1 @xcite . for more details of the sdss",
    "see @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "cluster selection was performed on 379 deg@xmath0 of sdss commissioning data , covering the area @xmath19(2000 ) = 355  to 56  and 145.3  to 236.0  at @xmath20(2000)= -1.25  to 1.25   ( runs 94/125 and 752/756 ) .",
    "the clusters studied here were selected from these imaging data using a color - magnitude maximum - likelihood brightest cluster galaxy method ( maxbcg ; @xcite ) .",
    "the clusters are described in the sdss cluster catalog of @xcite .",
    "the maxbcg method selects clusters based on the well - known color - luminosity relation of the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) and the e / s0 red ridgeline .",
    "the method provides a cluster richness estimate , @xmath21  ( the number of e / s0 galaxies within 1 @xmath2 mpc of the bcg that are fainter than the bcg and brighter than @xmath22(lim ) = -20.25 ) , and a cluster redshift estimate that maximizes the cluster likelihood ( with 1-@xmath3 uncertainty of @xmath23 = 0.014 for @xmath21@xmath2410 and @xmath23 = 0.01 for @xmath21@xmath2420 clusters ) .",
    "we use all maxbcg clusters in the estimated redshift range @xmath25 = 0.1 - 0.3 that are above a richness threshold of @xmath21@xmath24 10 ( corresponding to velocity dispersion @xmath26350 km s@xmath27 ) ; the sample contains 1108 clusters .",
    "the selection function and false - positive detection rate for these clusters have been estimated from simulations and from visual inspection to be @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the two - point spatial correlation function is determined by comparing the observed distribution of cluster pairs as a function of pair separation with the distribution of random catalogs in the same volume .",
    "the correlation function is estimated from the relation @xmath29 , where @xmath30(@xmath15 ) and @xmath31(@xmath15 ) are the frequencies of cluster - cluster pairs as a function of pair separation @xmath15 in the data and in random catalogs , respectively .",
    "the random catalogs contain @xmath32 times the number of clusters in each data sample ; the clusters are randomly positioned on the sky within the surveyed area .",
    "the redshifts of the random clusters follow the redshifts of the observed clusters in order to minimize possible selection effects with redshift .",
    "comoving coordinates in a flat lcdm cosmology with @xmath4= 0.3 and a hubble constant of @xmath33 = 100 @xmath6 km s@xmath27 mpc@xmath27 are used throughtout .    the uncertainty in the estimated cluster redshifts ( @xmath23 = 0.01 for @xmath21@xmath2420 clusters and @xmath23 = 0.014 for @xmath21@xmath2410 to @xmath2415 clusters ;  [ clusterselection ] ) causes a small smearing effect in the cluster correlations .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to correct for this effect .",
    "we use simulations with a realistic cluster distribution with redshift and richness , convolve the clusters with the observed gaussian scatter in redshift as given above , and determine the new convolved cluster correlation function .",
    "as expected , the redshift uncertainty causes a slight weakening of the true correlation function , especially at small separations , due to the smearing effect of the redshift uncertainty .",
    "we determine the correction factor for this effect as a function of scale @xmath15 from 10@xmath0 monte carlo simulations for each sample .",
    "the correction factor ( typically @xmath34 ) is then applied to the correlation function .",
    "an additional small correction factor due to false - positive detections is also determined from monte carlo simulations using the estimated false - positive detection rate of @xmath35 for @xmath21@xmath2410 clusters , @xmath36 for @xmath21@xmath2413 , and @xmath37 for the richest clusters with @xmath21@xmath2415 .",
    "the correlation function uncertainties are determined from the monte carlo simulations .",
    "each simulation contains the same number of clusters as the relevant data sample .",
    "the final uncertainties include the statistical uncertainties and the uncertainties due to the small correction factors in the redshift and false - positive corrections .",
    "the correlation function is determined for clusters with richness thresholds of @xmath21 @xmath2410 , @xmath2413 , @xmath2415 , and @xmath2420 .",
    "the space densities of these clusters , corrected for selection function and redshift uncertainty @xcite , are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 mpc@xmath42 ( @xmath25 = 0.1 - 0.3 ) .",
    "the correlation function of the four samples are presented in figure 1 and table 1 .",
    "the best - fit power - law relation , @xmath43(@xmath15 ) = ( @xmath44)@xmath45 , derived for @xmath15 @xmath46 50 @xmath2 mpc , is shown for each sample .",
    "the power - law slope @xmath47 has been treated both as a free parameter and as a fixed value ( @xmath47 = 2 ) .",
    "the difference in the correlation scale @xmath48 for these different slopes is small ( @xmath49 ) , well within the measured uncertainty .",
    "the richness dependence of the cluster correlation function is shown in figure 2 ; it is presented as the dependence of the correlation scale @xmath48 on the cluster mean separation @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "samples with intrinsically larger mean separations correspond to lower intrinsic cluster abundances ( @xmath51 = @xmath52 ) and thus to higher cluster richness and mass ( for complete samples ) .",
    "we compare our results with those of previous optically and x - ray selected cluster samples ( figure 2 ) .",
    "these include the correlation function of abell clusters ( @xcite ; richness class @xmath241 ; richness = 0 clusters are an incomplete sample and should not be included ) ; apm clusters @xcite ; edinburgh - durham clusters ( edcc ; @xcite ) ; las - campanas distant cluster survey ( lcdcs ; @xcite ) ; galaxy groups ( 2df ; @xcite ) ; and x - ray selected clusters ( reflex : @xcite ; and xbacs : @xcite ) .",
    "a summary of the results is presented in table 1 .",
    "for proper comparison of different samples , we will use the same set of standard parameters in the relative @xmath48 - @xmath50 plot : redshift @xmath180 , correlation power - law slope @xmath53 , and all scales are in comoving units in the lcdm cosmology .",
    "we discuss these below .",
    "most of the cluster samples are at small redshifts , @xmath54 0.1 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the only exceptions are the sdss clusters ( @xmath55 0.1 - 0.3 ) , and the lcdcs ( @xmath55 0.35 - 0.575 ) .",
    "to convert the results to @xmath18 0 we use large - scale cosmological simulations of an lcdm model and determine the cluster correlation function and the @xmath48 - @xmath50 relation at different redshifts .",
    "details of the simulations and cluster selection are given in @xcite ( see also  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "the correlation function is determined following the same method used for the data .",
    "we find that while both @xmath48 and @xmath50 increase with redshift for the same mass clusters , as expected , there is no significant change ( @xmath56 ) in the @xmath48 - @xmath50 relation as the redshift changes from @xmath10 = 0 to @xmath1 0.5 ( for @xmath57 mpc ) . in figure 2",
    "we plot the individual parameters @xmath48 and @xmath50 at the sample s measured redshift as listed in table 1 ; the relative @xmath48 - @xmath50 relation remains essentially unchanged to @xmath58 0 .",
    "most of the cluster correlation functions ( table 1 ) have a power - law slope in the range of @xmath59 .",
    "the apm highest richness subsamples report steeper slopes ( 3.2 , 2.8 , 2.3 ) ; they also have the smallest number of clusters ( 17 , 29 , 58 ) .",
    "the correlation scale @xmath48 is inversely correlated with the power - law slope ; a steeper slope typically yields a smaller correlation scale .",
    "we use the apm best @xmath60 fit for @xmath48 at @xmath47 = 2 @xcite for these richest subsamples . using cosmological simulations",
    ", we investigate the dependence of @xmath48 on the slope within the more typical observed range of @xmath61 . for the current range of mean separations",
    "@xmath50 we find only a small change in @xmath48 ( @xmath62 ) when the slope changes within this observed range .",
    "the x - ray cluster sample xbacs yields similar correlation scales for slopes ranging from @xmath1 1.8 to 2.5 ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the sdss correlation scales are essentially the same when using a free slope fit ( typically 1.7 to 2.1 ) or a fixed slope of 2 .",
    "since most of the observations are reported with a slope of 2 , we adopt the latter as the standard slope for the results presented in figure 2 .",
    "the only correction applied is to the three highest richness apm subsamples ; these are shown both with and without the correction .",
    "we also varify using cosmological simulations that the lcdcs sample at @xmath18 0.35 - 0.575 , with a slope of 2.15 , has an @xmath48 - @xmath50 relation consistent with the standard set of parameters used in figure 2 ( @xmath55 0 , @xmath63 2 ) .    finally , we convert all scales ( @xmath48 and @xmath50 from table 1 ) to the same @xmath4=0.3 cosmology ( lcdm ) .",
    "the effect of the cosmology on the observed @xmath48 - @xmath50 relation is small ( @xmath56 ) , partly due to the small redshifts , where the effect is small , but also because the cosmology affects both @xmath48 and @xmath50 in the same way , thus minimizing the relative change in the @xmath48 - @xmath50 relation .",
    "a comparison of all the results , including the minor corrections discussed above , is shown in figure 2 .",
    "figure 2a presents both optically and x - ray selected clusters ; figure 2b includes only the optical samples .",
    "the richness - dependence of the cluster correlation function is apparent in figure 2 .",
    "the x - ray clusters suggest somewhat stronger correlations than the optical clusters , at a @xmath12-@xmath3 level .",
    "improved optical and x - ray samples should reduce the scatter and help address this important comparison .",
    "we compare the results with large - scale cosmological simulations of a standard lcdm model ( @xmath4= 0.3 , @xmath6 = 0.67 , @xmath64 = 0.9 ) , and a tilted scdm model , tscdm ( @xmath4= 1 , @xmath6 = 0.5 , @xmath65 = 0.625 , @xmath64 = 0.5 ) .",
    "the tpm high - resolution large - volume simulations @xcite used @xmath66 particles with an individual particle mass of @xmath67 m@xmath68 ; the periodic box size is 1000 @xmath2 mpc for lcdm and 669 @xmath2 mpc for tscdm .",
    "the simulated clusters are ordered by their abundance based on cluster mass within 1.5 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "the results of the cosmological simulations for the @xmath48 - @xmath50 relation of @xmath10 = 0 clusters are presented by the two bands in figure 2 ( 1-@xmath3 range ) .",
    "a correlation function slope of 2 was used in the analysis .",
    "we also show the simulations results of @xcite for lcdm , and @xcite for a standard untilted scdm ( @xmath4= 1 , @xmath6 = 0.5 , @xmath65 = 1 , @xmath64 = 0.7 ) .",
    "the agreement among the simulations is excellent .",
    "as expected , the untilted scdm model yields smaller @xmath48 s than the strongly tilted model ; lcdm yields the strongest correlations .",
    "we determine an analytic relation that approximates the observed and the lcdm @xmath48 - @xmath50 relation : @xmath8 ( for @xmath69 ; all scales are in @xmath2 mpc ) .",
    "the observed richness - dependent cluster correlation function agrees well with the standard lcdm model .",
    "the correlation scales , and the @xmath48 - @xmath50 relation , increase as @xmath4@xmath6 decreases and the spectrum shifts to larger scales .",
    "the @xmath4= 1 models yield considerably weaker correlations than observed .",
    "this fact has of course been demonstrated earlier ; in fact , the strength of the cluster correlation function and its richness dependence were among the first indications against the standard @xmath4= 1 scdm model ( @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "the scatter in the observed @xmath48 - @xmath50 relation among different samples is still large , especially when both the optical and x - ray selected samples are included .",
    "a high - precision determination of the cosmological parameters can not therefore be achieved at this point .",
    "we determine the cluster correlation function and its richness dependence using 1108 clusters of galaxies found in 379 deg@xmath0 of early sdss data .",
    "the cluster correlation function shows a clear richness dependence , with increasing correlation strength with cluster richness / mass .",
    "the results are combined with previous samples of optical and x - ray clusters , and compared with cosmological simulations .",
    "we find that the richness - dependent cluster correlation function is consistent with predictions from the standard flat lcdm model ( @xmath4= 0.3 , @xmath6 = 0.7 ) , and , as expected , inconsistent with the weaker correlations predicted by @xmath4= 1 models .",
    "we derive an analytic relation for the correlation scale versus cluster mean separation relation that best describes the observations and the lcdm expectations : @xmath8 .",
    "x - ray selected clusters suggest somewhat stronger correlations than the optically selected clusters , at a @xmath12-@xmath3 level .",
