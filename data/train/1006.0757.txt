    "the mass of a standard model higgs boson is constrained by direct searches performed at lep and measurements of the top quark and w boson masses @xcite .",
    "combining these results , the higgs mass @xmath2 must be less than 186 gev at 95% confidence level .",
    "if @xmath3 gev , then higgs bosons are expected to decay primarily to @xmath4 . at hadron colliders ,",
    "the inclusive @xmath4 cross section is six orders of magnitude larger than the cross section for higgs production , so it is not feasible to find evidence for low - mass higgs bosons produced alone .",
    "instead , we search for associated production of vector ( @xmath5 , @xmath0 ) and higgs bosons . requiring leptonic decay of the @xmath5 or @xmath0 dramatically reduces the multijet background and increases our sensitivity to the higgs signal .",
    "the analysis discussed here is concerned exclusively with @xmath6 production in the @xmath7 final state ; the d0 collaboration has also completed similar analyses using @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite final states .",
    "the irreducible backgrounds in this search are @xmath0 production with heavy - flavor jets , top quark pair production , and diboson final states .",
    "instrumental backgrounds include jets faking charged leptons and light jets faking heavy - flavor jets .",
    "a more detailed description of this analysis may be found in @xcite .",
    "the tevatron is a proton - antiproton collider located at fermilab near chicago , il .",
    "collisions have a center - of - mass energy of @xmath10 tev .",
    "fermilab s accelerator division continues to optimize the integrated luminosity produced by the tevatron , and currently the accelerator is performing better than ever before .",
    "the total integrated luminosity delivered from runii is over 7 @xmath11 ; results discussed here use up to 4.1 @xmath11 of data .",
    "d0 is a multi - purpose particle detector , one of two detectors located at collision points around the tevatron .",
    "we have taken data with 90% average efficiency since the start of runii . in this search",
    ", we employ every major component of d0 in order to identify muons , electrons , and heavy - flavor jets @xcite .",
    "we strive for maximum higgs signal acceptance , so our event selection is very loose . for muons , we require central track matches , @xmath12 gev , and @xmath13 .",
    "electron requirements are @xmath14 gev and @xmath15 .",
    "all identified leptons are also required to pass various tracking and calorimeter isolation criteria , and the invariant mass of the dilepton pair must match the @xmath0 boson resonance : @xmath16 gev .    to be sure we accept as many higgs events as possible , we select some electrons and muons that are not initially identified as such . in the inter - cryostat region ( icr ) where there is little calorimeter coverage , we look for electrons that have been reconstructed as taus . in the various gaps in muon coverage , we look for isolated tracks .",
    "these additions improve our signal acceptance by 15% .",
    "we select events with at least 2 jets , leading jet @xmath17 gev and second jet @xmath14 gev . before tagging , @xmath18 .    using d0 s neural net b - tagging algorithm @xcite",
    ", we require either two loose tags ( inclusive ) or one tight tag ( exclusive ) , which improves @xmath19 by factors of 20 or 10 , respectively .",
    "the optimization of our final multivariate discriminant depends significantly on b - tag criteria , as do the expected signal and background yields , so we can improve our higgs sensitivity by analyzing these orthogonal b - tag samples separately .",
    "with the two highest-@xmath20 tagged jets or the one tagged jet and highest-@xmath20 untagged jet , we compute the invariant mass of the dijet system , which is the kinematical variable most sensitive to low - mass higgs production .      with an ideal detector",
    ", we would have very little missing @xmath21 in @xmath22 events .",
    "thus , events with a large @xmath20 imbalance must result from either background processes or mismeasurement .",
    "given our knowledge of the jet and lepton energy resolutions , we can make our measurements more precise and discriminate against backgrounds such as multijet production and @xmath23 . to do this",
    ", we perform a constrained multi - dimensional fit on the @xmath20 , @xmath24 , and azimuthal angle @xmath25 of the two leptons and two candidate jets .",
    "we constrain the dilepton invariant mass to @xmath26 gev and the vector sum of @xmath20 to @xmath27 gev .",
    "subsequently , we remove events with high kinematic fit @xmath28 values to reduce instrumental background . as a result of the fit ,",
    "the dijet mass resonance in higgs events is more prominent , which translates directly to a 6 - 11% increase in higgs sensitivity .",
    "production , expressed as ratios to the standard model expectations.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we use boosted decision trees ( bdt ) @xcite to combine the discrimination power of several kinematical variables : the dijet mass and @xmath20 , the dilepton @xmath20 and colinearity , and many others .",
    "no evidence for @xmath6 production is seen , so we compute upper cross section limits based on the shape of the bdt output , using a modified frequentist approach @xcite .",
    "the leading sources of systematic uncertainty are the @xmath29heavy - flavor cross section ( 20% ) , the jet energy scale ( 10% ) , and b - tagging efficiencies ( 10% ) . assuming a higgs mass of 115 gev",
    ", we exclude @xmath6 production above 9.1 times the standard model expectation at 95% confidence level .",
    "limits assuming other higgs masses are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] .    upon comparison to previous results @xcite ,",
    "our limits have improved roughly 12% beyond what is expected with more data .",
    "this is due to our use of more optimal selection criteria and more sophisticated analysis techniques .",
    "we are currently investigating further improvements to the analysis , including the use of matrix - element discriminants , improved b - tagging , and further optimization of our multivariate discriminant .",
