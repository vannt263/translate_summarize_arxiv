    "the origin of this extraordinary quantization , by which the conduction properties of a device are independent of the material properties , is intimately linked to the fact that in quantum hall bars transport takes place only through the edges which host chiral states for which backscattering is forbidden.@xcite in turn , the existence of chiral edge states that permit non - dissipative transport is warranted by the topological order of the electronic states of the two dimensional gas states . for two decades , this state of affairs was observed at cryogenic temperatures , under high applied magnetic fields , in two dimensional electron gases , hosted by carefully designed modulation doped semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "the discovery of quantum hall effect on graphene@xcite even at room - temperature@xcite on one side , and the proposal@xcite and subsequent discovery@xcite of quantum spin hall insulators on the other , have dramatically expanded the materials and experimental conditions under which non - dissipative quantum transport linked to topological order can occur .",
    "most of the striking electronic properties of graphene are related to the absence of a gap separating the conduction and valence bands which can thereby be described in terms of massless dirac fermions.@xcite in particular , the magneto - electronic properties of graphene are fundamentally different from a non - relativistic two dimensional electron gas on three counts:@xcite the existence of two identical sets of landau levels , for electrons and holes , the scaling of their energy with @xmath9 , as opposed to linear scaling of non - relativistic fermions , and the existence of the @xmath10 landau level with zero energy .",
    "these properties make the quantum hall effect in graphene@xcite different from the one originally discovered in gaas two dimensional electron gases.@xcite    there are several physical scenarios that motivate the study of the electronic properties of gapped graphene .",
    "first , a gap could be opened by interaction driven electronic order,@xcite specially when a high magnetic field is applied .",
    "second , as a result of the influence of the substrate like sic@xcite or hexagonal boron nitride ( bn),@xcite although the lattice mismatch is known to complicate this second possibility.@xcite third , bn itself can be described with the tight - binding hamiltonian of gapped graphene and the @xmath11 hamiltonian of other two dimensional materials with hexagonal symmetry , such as mos@xmath12 , can be described with a massive dirac hamiltonian.@xcite fourth , intrinsic spin orbit coupling also opens a gap in graphene,@xcite with different sign at the two valleys , albeit very small.@xcite    all of this leads to the question of how magnetotransport properties of graphene and graphene - like materials change when a gap opens or , in the long wavelength limit , how massive and massless dirac fermions are different in their reaction to an applied magnetic field .",
    "it turns out that , when the gap is opened by a constant staggered potential , i.e. , a potential that acts with opposite sign in the two sublattices of graphene , as it happens if pseudospin magnetism , or in the case of hexagonal boron nitride , the answer to the question is quite straightforward from the theory standpoint .",
    "this occurs because there is a simple one - to - one relation between the energy levels and wave functions of a bipartite lattice hamiltonian with no staggered potential and those of the same lattice when a constant staggered potential is added.@xcite this relation permits to anticipate that quantum hall effect of massive dirac fermions is much closer to the one of massless dirac fermions than to the one of non - relativistic electrons.@xcite     @xmath13 nm@xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 nm@xmath14 and ( d ) zigzag ribbon edges @xmath17",

    "this could be the case , for instance , of a heterostructure made of two graphene or graphene - like materials with different gaps @xmath0 and @xmath1 , such as the atomic layers of hybridized bn and graphene domains,@xcite or if the gap is substrate - driven and , due to lattice mismatch , features amplitude modulations larger the graphene unit cell.@xcite here we study the electronic properties of heterojunctions formed between two gapped graphene - like systems , with different gaps , in the quantum hall regime . when decoupled , both hall bars would have its own set of chiral edge states .",
    "when coupled , the way edge states merge determines the electronic properties of the interface , which is the focus of this work .",
    "as we discuss below , we encounter two types of interface states",
    ". the hybridization of pre - existing edge states that carry electrons in opposite directions will give rise to interface states that can carry electrons in both directions .",
    "in contrast , the merger of two bars with opposite gaps gives rise to two interface states whose energy lies within the gap . at zero magnetic field",
    "these states can be rationalized as follows . when restricted to one valley @xmath21",
    ", graphene electrons can be assigned a chern number @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . according to the index theorem@xcite , the interface between two insulators with chern numbers @xmath24 and @xmath25 should host @xmath26 domain wall states , which will correspond to zero modes in the case of one dimension @xcite and chiral bands or kink states in two dimensions .",
    "these are very similar to the recently discussed kink states in the interface of two graphene bilayers@xcite and multilayers@xcite with a gap opened by the application of an electric field with opposite direction at the two sides of the junction .",

    "it is apparent that , as the length of the transport channel @xmath153 increases , the transmission tends to the quantized values , when the energy crosses edge states ( green line ) , but tends to zero in the case of the kink states ( black and red lines ) .",
    "furthermore , when the energy crosses both edge and interphase states ( blue line ) the channels corresponding to the interphase states are attenuate as the length is increased .",
    "therefore , backscattering is possible , which is expected since two states with opposite velocities coexist in the interface region .",
    "when the same analysis is done for a zigzag ribbon with @xmath137 , the results found are quite similar ( see fig .",
    "[ zopoud ] ) .",
    "therefore , our transport results show that , unlike edge states , kink states living in the interface of two gapped graphene regions with opposite gaps are not protected .",
    "it must be stressed that , very much like in the case of gapped bilayer graphene , the existence of two valleys prevents the robustness of kink states with respect to disorder , as it would happen in the case of kink states located at the domain wall for a two dimensional electron gas of dirac electrons .",
    "in this section we study transport across of the boundary that separates two gapped graphene quantum hall bars .",
    "our main goal is to analyse the backscattering that takes place at the interface due to interface states that connect the edges . a scheme of this heterostructure , made of two regions with constant mass @xmath193 that meet at an abrupt interface , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1:band](a ) .",
    "we consider transport across the interface region which , in addition to the stepwise constant mass has anderson disorder with @xmath194 t over a distance @xmath180 .",
    "away from the interface each side of the junction hosts a set of landau levels and edge states as described in the section ii . because both electrodes have a gap @xmath36 , conductance is only possible for states with energy @xmath195 .",
    "both sides of the structure host chiral edge states that do not backscatter , even in the presence of disorder , unless electrons at one edge can undergo scattering to the other edge . this could be enabled if interface states , i.e. , states running along the interface , perpendicular to the transport direction , are available at the fermi energy and are not completely blocked by disorder . below",
    "we show that interface states , perpendicular to the transport direction , can act as an efficient shortcut between the right - goers in one edge and the left - goers in the other ( see fig . [ fig1:band ] ) , providing a backscattering channel which destroys the conductance quantization .",
    "it must be stressed that , in this geometry , the in - gap kink states studied in the previous section , do not play a role in transport , due to the absence of transport states in the electrodes inside the gap .    in figs .",
    "[ aoporl ] and [ zoporl ] we show results for the conductance of both armchair and zigzag heterojunctions .",
    "the interface between the two armchair ( zigzag ) ribbons with opposite mass is given by a zigzag ( armchair ) boundary whose properties can be related to those of the infinite graphene zigzag ( armchair ) ribbon with inhomogenous mass . for that matter , the top panel of figs .",
    "[ aoporl ] and [ zoporl ] shows the velocity density map obtained for the infinite ribbon with @xmath137 .",
    "whereas a priori this velocity density should not be identical to the boundary of fig . [ fig1:band](a ) , due to the finite width of the of the hall bar , our results indicate that it permits to anticipate the existence of backscattering induced by interface states .    since we are interested in the interface states as a source of backscattering , it is not necessary to consider a long central region with disorder , as we did in the previous section .",
    "in addition , the role of disorder here could be to reduce the efficiency of the interface states to produce backscattering , improving the conductance thereby .    for both armchair and zigzag geometries the conductance is zero for @xmath196 t and",
    "is quantized in @xmath197 above the gap , over an energy interval that coincides with the absence of interface states , shown in the panel ( a ) of figs .",
    "[ aoporl ] and [ zoporl ] .",
    "the comparison of the velocity density for an infinite ribbon with the two terminal conductance for both heterostructures , reveals a relation between the existence of interface states in the junction ( ( a ) panels ) and the backscattering in transport ( ( b ) panels ) . in particular , the two spectral regions with null velocity density at the interface give quantized plateaus of conductance .",
    "this is particularly apparent in the case the plateau with @xmath197 for @xmath198 right above the band gap .    the connection between interface states and backscattering if further confirmed by studying the conductance as a function of the width of the hall bar , at four different energies . in figs .",
    "[ aoporl](c ) and [ zoporl](c ) at the energies black and blue , the backscattering is completely canceled for sufficiently wide ribbons . at those energies ,",
    "there are no interface states . in contrast , for energies red and green , the conductance oscillates as a function of the ribbon width .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows . as the ribbon width",
    "is increased , the discrete spectrum of interface states shifts .",
    "when a interface state is in resonance with the electrode states , the backscattering is possible and conductance is reduced .",
    "in contrast , peaks in the transmission corresponds to poor matching between incoming state and interface state .",
    "it is apparent that the amplitude of the oscillations does not decrease significantly as the width of the ribbon increases , even in the presence of disorder .",
    "this suggest that the localization length of the interface states along the direction perpendicular to transport is longer than the ribbon width .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar in the case of a heterostructure made of zigzag ribbon with opposite masses . in this case the domain wall separating the two regions with opposite mass runs along the armchair direction .",
    "disorder seems to have two effects on the interface - state induced backscattering in these heterojunction .",
    "one one side , is probably increasing the mixing of edge states to interface states , which should enhance the backscattering . on the other side , for sufficiently wide ribbons disorder could result in the localization of the interface states that are responsible of backscattering , which should decrease the backscattering .",
    "the comparison of the two curves with and without disorder in the middle panels of figs .",
    "[ aoporl ] and [ zoporl ] indicate that , the dominance of one effect over the other depends on energy .",
    "in general , the interface induced backscattering effect is not qualitatively affected by disorder .",
    "we now briefly discuss the effect on the previous results of a non - abrupt change of the @xmath35 across the junction . for that matter",
    ", we consider transport across a region where the gap changes linearly in the direction of the ribbon .",
    "we assume a device with a fixed total length @xmath153 , which contains a central region determined by @xmath151 , where the gap changes from @xmath181 in the left electrode to @xmath199 at the right , as depicted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ aoporl](d ) .",
    "anderson disorder is present in the entire device of length @xmath153 . for the sake of briefness we limit our discussion to the case of armchair ribbons ,",
    "although we have also obtained similar results for the zigzag case .    in figs .",
    "[ aoporl](d , e ) we present the two terminal conductance as a function of the energy , for two different values of the length scale @xmath151 that characterize the soft mass transition , @xmath184 and @xmath185 nm ( or in units of the magnetic length defined in eq .",
    "( [ mag_scale ] ) @xmath200 and @xmath201 @xmath152 ) .",
    "it is apparent that for the sharper transition ( @xmath200 ) the curves @xmath202 ( fig.[aoporl](d ) ) is very similar to the abrupt transition shown in fig .",
    "[ aoporl](b ) . for the softer mass transition ( @xmath201 @xmath152 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ aoporl](e ) , the backscattering induced at the interface is depleted .",
    "we have studied the electronic properties of graphene quantum hall bars with a position dependent mass @xmath35 .",
    "we have considered the case of stepwise constant @xmath35 .",
    "we have found that at the boundary of two regions with opposite @xmath35 both in - gap kink states and interface states appear .",
    "interface states arise from the mixing of counter - propagating edge states that coexist in energy .",
    "in contrast , kink states arise in the domain wall between two gapped regions and do not coexist in energy with bulk states . in the case of zigzag ribbons",
    ", there is one kink state at each valley , whose propagation direction changes from valley to valley .",
    "we have studied transport in two different configurations that would permit to probe either the in - gap kink states or the interface states .",
    "the study of transport parallel to the interface between two graphene regions with opposite @xmath35 in the quantum hall regime , permits one to study the properties of the kink states ( section iii ) .",
    "we have found that the coexistence in real space of two counter - propagating kink states , corresponding to the two valleys , leaves them unprotected from backscattering created by disorder . in the case of zigzag ribbon , backscattering requires changing valley , which in turn requires short - range scattering , provided by the anderson disorder .",
    "the study of transport across the junction of two semi - infinite ribbons with opposite mass , discussed in section v , permits studying the effect of interface states as sources of backscattering .",
    "our calculations show how an incoming electron to the junction from a chiral edge state could scatter to a kink state propagating from one edge the opposite , enabling backscattering at the specific energies at which interface states exist .",
    "our calculations represent a toy model for situations in which graphene quantum hall bars have a position dependent mass",
