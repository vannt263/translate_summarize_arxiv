    "extraction of energy from a black hole or an accretion disk through magnetic braking has been investigated by many people . as a rotating black hole",
    "is threaded by magnetic field lines which connect with remote astrophysical loads , energy and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole and transported to the remote loads via poynting flux ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; macdonald & thorne 1982 ; phinney 1983 ) .",
    "this is usually called the blandford - znajek mechanism and has been suggested to be a plausible process for powering jets in active galactic nuclei ( rees , begelman , blandford , & phinney 1982 ; begelman , blandford , & rees 1984 ) and gamma ray bursts ( paczyski 1993 ; lee , wijers , & brown 1999 )",
    ". similar process can happen to an accretion disk when some of magnetic field lines threading the disk are open and connect with remote astrophysical loads ( blandford 1976 ; blandford & znajek 1977 ; macdonald & thorne 1982 ; livio , ogilvie , & pringle 1999 ; li 1999 ) .",
    "in this paper we investigate the effects of magnetic field lines connecting a kerr black hole with a disk surrounding it .",
    "this kind of magnetic field lines are expected to exist and have important effects ( macdonald & thorne 1982 ; blandford 1999 , 2000 ; gruzinov 1999 ) .",
    "we find that , with the existence of such magnetic coupling between the black hole and the disk , energy and angular momentum are transfered between them .",
    "if the black hole rotates faster than the disk , energy and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole and transferred to the disk via poynting flux .",
    "this is the case when @xmath7 for a thin keplerian disk , where @xmath1 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath8 is the angular momentum of the black hole . throughout the paper",
    "we use the geometric units with @xmath9 .",
    "the energy deposited into the disk by the black hole is eventually radiated to infinity by the disk .",
    "this provides a way for extracting energy from a black hole through its disk .",
    "if the disk has no accretion ( or the accretion rate is very low ) , the power of the disk essentially comes from the rotational energy of the black hole .",
    "we will show that the magnetic coupling between the black hole and the disk has a higher efficiency in extracting energy from a kerr black hole than the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "suppose a bunch of magnetic field lines connect a rotating black hole with a disk surrounding it .",
    "due to the rotation of the black hole and the disk , electromotive forces are induced on both the black hole s horizon and the disk ( macdonald & thorne 1982 ; li 1999 ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the angular velocity of the black hole , @xmath12 is the angular velocity of the disk , @xmath13 is the magnetic flux connecting the black hole with the disk . the black hole and the disk form a closed electric circuit , the electric current flows through the magnetic field lines connecting them .",
    "suppose the disk and the black hole rotates in the same direction , then @xmath14 and @xmath15 have opposite signs .",
    "this means that energy and angular momentum are transferred either from the black hole to the disk or from the disk to the black hole , the direction of transfer is determined by the sign of @xmath16 . by the ohm s law ,",
    "the current is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the resistance of the black hole which is of several hundred ohms ( the disk is perfectly conducting so its resistance is zero ) .",
    "the power deposited into the disk by the black hole is @xmath19 the torque on the disk produced by the black hole is @xmath20 as expected , we have @xmath21 .",
    "the signs of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are determined by the sign of @xmath24 . when @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 and @xmath27 , energy and angular momentum are transferred from the black hole to the disk .",
    "when @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 , energy and angular momentum are transferred from the disk to the black hole so the black hole is spun up . for a disk with non - rigid rotation",
    ", @xmath12 varies with radius . for fixed values of @xmath13 , @xmath11 , and @xmath18 , @xmath22 peaks at @xmath31 .",
    "however for realistic cases which is most important is when the magnetic field lines touch the disk close to the inner boundary , so @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ pow3 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ toq ] ) can be taken to be the value at the inner boundary of the disk . according to gruzinov ( 1999 )",
    "the magnetic fields will be more unstable against screw instability if the foot - points of the field lines on the disk are far from the inner boundary of the disk .    for a thin keplerian disk around a kerr black hole in the equatorial plane ,",
    "the angular velocity of the disk is ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the boyer - lindquist radius in kerr spacetime .",
    "@xmath34 decreases with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "the angular velocity of a kerr black hole is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the radius of the event horizon .",
    "@xmath11 is constant on the horizon .",
    "the inner boundary of a keplerian disk is usually assumed to be at the marginally stable orbit with radius ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) @xmath37^{1/2}\\right\\}\\ , ,      \\label{rms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38\\ , ,      \\label{rms2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath39 inserting eq .",
    "( [ rms ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ wd ] ) , we obtain the angular velocity of the disk at its inner boundary : @xmath40 . for the schwarzschild case ( i.e @xmath41 )",
    "we have @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "assuming the magnetic field lines touch the disk close to the inner boundary , we have @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the value of @xmath46 for the schwarzschild case , and @xmath47 is a function of @xmath48 only .",
    "the variation of @xmath22 with @xmath48 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath26 when @xmath49 , @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 at @xmath53 and @xmath54 since @xmath55 and @xmath56 when @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for fixed @xmath13 , @xmath1 , and @xmath18 , @xmath22 peaks at @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath23 always has the same sign as @xmath22 since @xmath60 for a perfectly conducting disk .",
    "when @xmath7 , energy and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole and transferred to the disk .",
    "so a fast rotating black hole can pump its rotational energy into a disk surrounding it through magnetic coupling between them .",
    "once the energy gets into the disk , it can be radiated to infinity either in the form of poynting flux associated with jets or winds , or in the form of thermal radiation associated with dissipative processes in the disk .",
    "if the disk is not accreting or its accretion rate is very low , then the disk s power comes from the rotational energy of the black hole .",
    "this provides a way for _ indirectly _ extracting energy from a rotating black hole .",
    "note , that the blandford - znajek mechanism is a way for _ directly _ extracting energy from a rotating black hole to the remote load .",
    "it is possible that the blandford - znajek mechanism provides a very `` clean '' energy beam , while energy extracted from the disk is `` dirty '' , contaminated by matter from the disk corona ( r. d. blandford 1999a , private communication ) .",
    "however , we must keep in mind that there exists no quantitative model demonstrating how to generate clean energy with the blandford - znajek process .",
    "let us consider again our case , in which kerr black hole loses its energy and angular momentum through the magnetic interaction with a thin keplerian disk , with the magnetic field lines touching the disk close to the marginally stable orbit .",
    "the evolution of the mass and angular momentum of the black hole are given by @xmath61 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by eq .",
    "( [ pow3 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ toq ] ) respectively , the factors @xmath62 come from the fact that a disk has two faces . from eq .",
    "( [ evol ] ) we obtain @xmath63 , where we have used @xmath64 .",
    "define the spin of a kerr black hole by @xmath65 , then we have @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a function of @xmath68 only .",
    "( [ dsm ] ) can be integrated @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "consider a kerr black hole with initial mass @xmath1 and the initial spin @xmath71 , which is the maximum value of @xmath68 that an astrophysical black hole can have ( thorne 1974 ) . as the black hole spins down to @xmath72 ,",
    "the total amount of energy extracted from the black hole by the disk can be calculated with eq .",
    "( [ mh ] ) : @xmath73 .",
    "this amount of energy will eventually be transported to infinity by the disk . in a realistic case",
    "the magnetic field lines touch the disk not exactly at the marginally stable orbit , the averaged angular velocity of the disk will be somewhat smaller than @xmath74 , then the total amount of energy that can be extracted from the black hole should be somewhat smaller than @xmath75 .    for comparison let s calculate the amount of energy that can be extracted from a kerr black hole by the blandford - znajek mechanism in the optimal case i.e. when the impedance matching condition is satisfied ( cf .",
    "macdonald & thorne 1982 ) .",
    "to do so , we only need to replace @xmath74 with @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ mh ] ) , since the power and torque of the black hole are related by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the angular velocity of magnetic field lines , and in the optimal case @xmath79 .",
    "then we obtain that as the black hole spins down from @xmath71 to @xmath80 the total energy extracted from the black hole by the blandford - znajek mechanism is @xmath81 .",
    "we find that the magnetic coupling between a black hole and a disk has a higher efficiency in extracting energy from the black hole than the blandford - znajek mechanism ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "this is because the energy extracted from the black hole by the magnetic coupling to the disk has a larger ratio of energy to angular momentum than is the case for the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "when a black hole rotates faster than the disk , which is the case if @xmath7 for a kerr black hole with a thin keplerian disk , then the black hole exerts a torque at the inner edge of the disk . the torque transfers energy and angular momentum from the black hole to the disk",
    "this is similar to the `` propeller '' mechanism in the case of a magnetized neutron star with a disk ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "the energy transfered to the disk is eventually radiated to infinity by the disk .",
    "this provides a mechanism for extracting energy from a black hole through its disk . for a kerr black hole with the initial mass @xmath1 and spin @xmath82 ,",
    "the total amount of energy that can be extracted by a thin keplerian disk is @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , this is more efficient than the blandford - znajek mechanism which can extract only @xmath81 ."
