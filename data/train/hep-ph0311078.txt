    "the argument can be extended even further : if quark masses were very large then chiral symmetry would be badly broken , and could not be used to characterize the phase transition .",
    "but in such a case the @xmath9 symmetry becomes more exact , and by reversing the roles of the protagonists in the previous discussion , we would find that the @xmath9 breaking drives the ( approximate ) restoration of chiral symmetry . which of the underlying symmetries demands and which amends can be determined directly from the critical behavior of the spatial correlators of hadrons or of the polyakov loop @xcite .    with quarks in the adjoint representation we investigated the physical scenario @xcite in chiral symmetry",

    "we have pointed to the existence of an interesting structure , which was hidden until now : there are still two distinct phase transitions , but since the fields are now entangled , the transitions are not independent .",
    "this entanglement is shown at the level of expectation values and spatial correlators of the fields .",
    "lattice simulations will play an important role in checking these predictions .",
    "the analysis can be extended for phase transitions driven by a chemical potential . for 2 colors",
    "there is a phase transition from a quark - antiquark condensate to a diquark condensate @xcite .",
    "we hence predict , in two color qcd , that when diquarks form for @xmath75 , the polyakov loop also feels the presence of the phase transition exactly in the same manner as it feels when considering the temperature driven phase transition .",
    "such a situation is supported by recent lattice simulations @xcite .",

    "<S> the polyakov loop is the appropriate deconfinement order parameter for yang - mills theories without quarks or with quarks in the adjoint representation of the gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> however it is not a physical state of the theory so the information regarding the center group symmetry must be transferred to the physical states . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly review how this transfer of information takes place . when adding quarks the center group is no longer a symmetry for matter in the fundamental representation . </S>",
    "<S> this feature allows us to explain why color deconfines when chiral symmetry is restored in hot gauge theories with massless quarks . for quarks in the adjoint representation </S>",
    "<S> we show that while deconfinement and the chiral transition do not coincide , entanglement between them is still present . finally , we discuss also the chemical potential driven phase transition .    recently in we have analyzed the problem of how , and to what extent the information encoded in the order parameter of a generic theory is transferred to the non - order parameter fields . this is a fundamental problem since in nature most fields are non - order parameter fields . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is especially relevant in qcd and qcd - like theories since there is no physical observable for deconfinement which is directly linked to the order parameter field . at nonzero temperature </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 center of @xmath1 is a relevant global symmetry @xcite , and it is possible to construct the polyakov loop @xmath2 operator . </S>",
    "<S> this object is charged with respect to the center @xmath0 of the @xmath3 gauge group @xcite , under which it transforms as @xmath4 with @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a relevant feature of the polyakov loop is that its expectation value vanishes in the low temperature regime , and is non - zero in the high temperature phase . </S>",
    "<S> the polyakov loop is thus a suitable order parameter for the yang - mills temperature driven phase transition @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the question is : how can the information about the yang - mills phase transition encoded in the @xmath0 global symmetry be communicated to the hadronic states of the theory . in , using an effective lagrangian approach , we have explicitly shown that is always possible on symmetry grounds to couple @xmath2 to the hadronic operators . </S>",
    "<S> effective lagrangians play a relevant role . in @xcite , for example , a number of fundamental properties for qcd were derived . </S>",
    "<S> of course , at a more elementary level the picture is that the gauge invariant operators of the theory carrying center group charges couple to hadronic states . </S>",
    "<S> if not protected by symmetries only an unnatural act would require these relevant couplings to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> such a picture is also confirmed within theoretical models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also showed @xcite that spatial correlators of the non - critical field are dominated at the phase transition by the critical behavior of the order parameter field . in this way the polyakov loop field imprints the knowledge of the phase transition on the non order parameter spatial correlators ( e.g. the glueball field ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results are applicable to any phase transition and as such are universal .    </S>",
    "<S> the picture changes considerably when quarks are added to the theory . </S>",
    "<S> if fermions are in the fundamental and pseudoreal representations for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , the corresponding @xmath8 or @xmath9 center of the group is never a good symmetry . for massless </S>",
    "<S> quarks the order parameter is the chiral condensate which characterizes the chiral phase transition . for @xmath10=3 and two massless quark flavors at finite temperature and zero baryon density , </S>",
    "<S> the chiral phase transition is in the same universality class as the three dimensional @xmath11 spin model @xcite , becoming a smooth crossover as small quark masses are accounted for @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath12 the relevant universality class is that of @xmath13 both for the fundamental and adjoint representations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even if the discrete symmetry is broken , one can still construct the polyakov loop and study the temperature dependence of its properties on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> one still observes a rise of the polyakov loop from low to high temperatures and naturally , although improperly , one speaks of deconfining phase transition @xcite . for fermions in the adjoint representation </S>",
    "<S> the center of the group remains a symmetry of the theory , and thus besides the chiral condensate , also the polyakov loop is an order parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , lattice results @xcite indicate that for ordinary qcd with quarks in the fundamental representation , chiral symmetry breaking and confinement ( i.e. a decrease of the polyakov loop ) occur at the same critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> lattice simulations also indicate that these two transitions do not happen simultaneously when the quarks are in the adjoint representation . despite the attempts to explain these behaviors @xcite , the underlying reasons are still unknown . recently , using an interesting model containing only hadrons this issue has also been addressed for ordinary qcd in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite we have proposed a solution to this puzzle based on the general approach established in @xcite , envisioned first in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two general features introduced in @xcite are essential : there exists a relevant trilinear interaction between the light order parameter and the heavy non - order parameter field , singlet under the symmetries of the order parameter field . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for an efficient transfer of information from the order parameter to the fields that are singlets with respect to the symmetry of the theory . as a result , the non - critical fields have infrared dominated spatial correlators . the second feature , also due to the existence of such an interaction , is that the finite expectation value of the order parameter field in the symmetry broken phase induces a variation in the expectation value for the singlet field , whose value generally is non - vanishing in the unbroken phase </S>"
