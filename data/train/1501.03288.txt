    "@xcite included two qhe elements in a quadrature bridge to realize the unit of capacitance .    in 1988 ,",
    "ricketts and kemeny ( rk )  @xcite proposed a circuit model suitable for the symbolic analysis of arbitrary electrical networks containing qhe elements , in dc or ac . the predictions of the rk model were also verified experimentally  @xcite .",
    "other circuit models were developed in later years  @xcite and a general method of analysis based on the indefinite admittance matrix has been recently proposed  @xcite .",
    "the circuit models proposed in the literature are better suited for the symbolic analysis of networks of qhe elements ; the matrix method can be employed both for symbolic and numerical analyses , typically with the aid of a computer algebra system or a numerical computing environment . nowadays , however , the numerical analysis of electrical circuits is commonly carried out by employing analogue electronic circuit simulation tools , like spice  @xcite and its derivatives .",
    "spice can perform simulations of linear and non - linear networks in time and frequency domains , and noise analysis . hence , it could be a very useful tool for the simulation of electrical networks containing qhe elements .",
    "unfortunately , even though the above cited circuit models can be directly coded in spice , several issues arise when trying to run a simulation .",
    "the aim of this work is to address these issues and to present a working spice macro - model for the simulation of networks of qhe elements .    in section  [ sec :",
    "review ] , we review the existing circuit models for qhe elements and present a new one . in section  [ sec : spice_modelling ] , we discuss the issues of spice modelling and provide a spice macro - model for an 8-terminal qhe element , which is based on the new circuit model . in section  [ sec : examples ] , three simulation examples are worked out in detail : i ) a dc analysis taking into account parasitic resistances ; ii ) an ac analysis of a network containing a qhe element and a capacitor ; iii ) a noise analysis .",
    "the simulation of example i ) is compared with an analytical result ; those of ii ) and iii ) are compared with analytical and experimental results .",
    "[ sec : yam ] reports the full derivation of the new circuit model .",
    "the development of circuit models for the hall effect is not a recent topic . for models related to the classical hall effect see , e.g.,@xcite ; in this section , instead , we shall briefly review the existing circuit models for _ ideal _ qhe elements .    in circuit theory ,",
    "an @xmath0-_terminal element _ is a black - box which can interact with its surroundings solely through @xmath0 conductors called",
    "_ terminals _ ( figure  [ fig : nterminal_element ] ) .",
    "a basic assumption of circuit theory is that an element is completely characterized by its external behaviour , that is , by the set of admissible terminal voltage - current pairs ( action at distance is excluded )  @xcite .",
    "two elements are thus _ equivalent _ from the point of view of circuit theory if they have the same external behaviour .",
    "an electric circuit composed of several interconnected elements can be itself turned into an @xmath0-terminal element by connecting terminals to @xmath0 selected nodes of the circuit .",
    "if a circuit , viewed as an @xmath0-terminal element , is equivalent to a certain @xmath0-terminal element @xmath1 , it is called a _ circuit model _ ( or _ equivalent circuit _ ) for * @xmath1*.    according to their external behaviour , ideal qhe elements can be classified in two categories . in the following , we shall call . ]",
    "an _ ideal clockwise ( cw ) qhe element _ with hall resistance @xmath2 , an element whose terminal voltages and currents are related by the equations @xmath3 with the convention @xmath4 , and we shall call an _ ideal counterclockwise ( ccw ) @xmath0-terminal qhe element _ , an element whose terminal voltages and currents are related by the equations @xmath5 with the convention @xmath6 .",
    "ideal qhe elements are _ memoryless _ , _ passive _ ( actually , they dissipate power ) and _ _ nonreciprocal__.    the sets of equations   and   are , indeed , a consequence of the qhe phenomenology , but can also be derived theoretically on the basis of the landauer - bttiker formalism ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "16.3 ) and references therein ) .",
    "a real qhe device operating at appropriate values of temperature and magnetic flux density can be modelled , with a certain approximation , either as an ideal cw or an ideal ccw element depending on the orientation of the magnetic field applied to the device and on the type of the majority charge carriers .",

    "all circuit models contain only resistors ( because of memorylessness and passivity ) and controlled sources ( because of nonreciprocity ) ; none of them are related to the actual device physics .",
    "we remark that the sets of equations   and   are all that is needed to analyse circuits containing ideal qhe elements  @xcite , and that the external behaviour of all the models listed in table  [ tab : circuit_models ] is exactly described by those equations .",
    "nonetheless , a circuit model can be a useful basis for taking into account nonidealities ( e.g.  nonzero longitudinal resistances  @xcite , parasitic elements in ac regime  @xcite ) or to develop a spice macro - model , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "in spice a circuit is represented by a list of statements ( _ netlist _ ) , written according to a certain specific syntax  @xcite , which describes how the elements that compose the circuit are interconnected . a spice macro - model ( or _ subcircuit netlist _ ) is a netlist with a designated name that can be treated as any other spice element to compose larger circuits in a hierarchical way .",
    "circuits composed exclusively of resistors and controlled sources can be directly translated into spice macro - models . given that all the models reported in table  [ tab : circuit_models ] are equivalent from the point of view of circuit theory , and that many more possessing this property can be conceived ,",
    "how can we select one with the purpose of writing a spice macro - model ?    in reality , spice modelling requires at least two additional properties , ( [ property:1 ] ) and ( [ property:2 ] ) below , but one more , ( [ property:3 ] ) , would be useful :    1 .   [ property:1 ]",
    "_ no loops of voltage sources_. spice requires a circuit that does not contain loops composed only of ideal voltage sources ( independent or controlled ) .",
    "in fact , violating this requirement would lead to two scenarios : either kirchhoff s voltage law would be violated or the current crossing the loop would be indeterminate and the circuit would not have a unique solution . in both cases",
    ", spice would not be able to solve the circuit .",
    "[ property:2 ] _ no cut sets of current sources_. this property is the dual of  ( [ property:1 ] ) .",
    "if , in a circuit , there is a node where only current sources join , either kirchhoff s current law would be violated or the node potential would be indeterminate ( floating node ) .",
    "[ property:3 ] _ non - dissipative / generative sources_. as stated in section  [ sec : review ] , qhe elements are passive elements that dissipate power .",
    "one property that could then be required by the circuit model is that all the power is dissipated in the resistors and that the overall power absorbed or delivered by the controlled sources is zero .",
    "this property would also allow spice to predict the thermal noise generated by the qhe elements correctly ( see  [ sec : yam ] for more details on this ) . even though this property is not strictly required , and even though spice has a few limitations in noise analysis ( e.g.  it is not able to analyse correlations directly and a workaround is needed  @xcite ) , it might be useful to have a circuit model which is as complete as possible .    by inspection ,",
    "it is easy to verify that models 1 and 3 of table  [ tab : circuit_models ] violate property  ( [ property:1 ] ) and that model 6 violates property  ( [ property:2 ] ) ; property  ( [ property:1 ] ) can also be violated by model 5 if a voltage source is connected between terminals 1 and 2 , or 3 and 4 .",
    "in addition , it is straightforward to verify that models 2,4 and 5 violate property  ( [ property:3 ] ) , which is generally not zero . ] .",
    "models 2,4 and 5 can not be easily modified to satisfy property  ( [ property:3 ] ) and will not be considered further .",
    "models 1 and 3 can be modified to satisfy property  ( [ property:1 ] ) either by adding a small series resistance to the loop of voltage sources  @xcite or by removing one of the controlled sources in the loop ( this does not alter the model s behaviour ) . however",
    ", none of the above two remedies is completely satisfactory : the former because the effect of the additional resistance on the simulation accuracy can not be easily predicted in the case of many interconnected qhe elements ; the latter because it destroys the symmetry of the model , making it more difficult to develop possible refinements to take account of nonidealities . for model 6 ,",
    "it is worth noting that the potential @xmath16 of the floating node can be fixed arbitrarily without altering the model s behaviour ; this allows the satisfaction of property  ( [ property:2 ] ) without the need for additional elements and without destroying the circuit symmetry .",
    "therefore , model 6 was selected to implement a spice macro - model .",
    "listings  [ lst : cw ] and  [ lst : ccw ] report , respectively , the spice macro - models for ideal cw and ccw qhe elements .",
    "these macro - models are a direct translation of the general circuit models derived in  [ sec : yam ] .",
    "the actual number of terminals is nine : the ninth terminal , labelled c , corresponds to the node joining the controlled current sources and has to be connected to an arbitrary potential ( e.g.  ground ) .",

    "substituting   in  , and taking into account that @xmath77 is real , yields @xmath105 equation   says that the power dissipated in the ideal qhe element is related only to the symmetric part of the corresponding indefinite admittance matrix .",
    "thus , no power is delivered or absorbed by the circuit associated with the antisymmetric part , and property  ( [ property:3 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "when spice performs the noise analysis of a circuit , it automatically assigns noise sources to certain circuit elements , in accordance with known noise models .",
    "the insertion of arbitrary noise sources is not permitted . in the case of the macro - models of listings  [ lst : cw ] and  [ lst :",
    "ccw ] , spice will assign noise sources to the resistors only : the controlled sources are considered noiseless .",
    "to each resistor , spice assign a noise source which generates the corresponding thermal ( equilibrium ) noise at the simulation temperature ( specified by the spice parameter ` tnom ` , by default ) .",
    "therefore , to prove that the satisfaction of property  ( [ property:3 ] ) allows spice to predict the equilibrium noise generated by the qhe elements correctly , we need only to prove that the equilibrium noise of a qhe element coincides with that of the resistive network associated with @xmath83 .",
    "the equilibrium noise properties of a general passive multiterminal network were derived by twiss  @xcite from thermodynamic considerations .",
    "later , bttiker derived an equivalent result for multiterminal conductors from a quantum scattering theory  @xcite .",
    "these results were verified experimentally by the authors in  @xcite .    for the present purposes , the result given by twiss",
    "is in a more convenient form .",
    "this result can be stated as follows  @xcite : consider a passive @xmath0-terminal element and assume that all the terminals are grounded and one , say terminal @xmath0 without loss of generality , is considered as reference ; then , the one - sided cross - spectral density function  @xcite @xmath106 between the noise currents @xmath107 and @xmath108 at the terminals @xmath109 and @xmath110 is given by @xmath111 where @xmath64 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath65 is the thermodynamic temperature and @xmath112 is the short - circuit @xmath113 admittance matrix obtained by considering the @xmath0-terminal element as an @xmath114-port with ports defined between the terminals @xmath115 and the reference node @xmath0 .",
    "the short - circuit admittance matrix can be obtained by the indefinite admittance matrix associated to the @xmath0-terminal element by deleting the @xmath0th row and column  @xcite ; then , for and ideal qhe element , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , \\\\ & = 2k_\\textup{b } t\\left[\\bar{(\\bi{y}}_\\textup{i})_{pq}+(\\bar{\\bi{y}}_\\textup{i})_{qp}\\right ] , \\\\ & = 4k_\\textup{b } t(\\bar{\\bi{y}}_\\textup{i}^\\textup{s})_{pq } , \\\\ & = 2k_\\textup{b } t\\left[\\bar{(\\bi{y}}_\\textup{i}^\\textup{s})_{pq}+(\\bar{\\bi{y}}_\\textup{i}^\\textup{s})_{qp}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , and taking into account that the reference node is arbitrary , the equilibrium noise of a qhe element coincides with that of the resistive network associated with @xmath83 .",
