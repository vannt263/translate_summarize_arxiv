    "marginal stability of the glassy equilibrium states to weak perturbations such as a small shift of temperatures has been a fundamental interest in the studies of spin - glasses and related systems including vortex lines systems in dirty type - ii super - conductors . in particular , the droplet picture based on scaling arguments and migdal - kadanoff type real - space renormalization - group calculations @xcite claims that any small but finite perturbation , such as changes of temperature by an amount @xmath0 , is enough to change the equilibrium states in such glassy systems completely at length scales larger than the so called overlap length @xmath1 .",
    "such a dramatic effect has been coined _",
    "temperature chaos_. it was anticipated that such a change of the equilibrium states , if it exists , should have significant consequences on dynamical observable such as the dynamical linear - susceptibility .",
    "@xcite    from the experimental side , a series of interesting experiments have been done with different spin - glasses measuring relaxations of thermo - remanent magnetization ( trm ) , zero - field cool magnetization ( zfc ) and ac - magnetic susceptibilities .",
    "they show strikingly rich dynamical aspects of spin - glasses subjected to small temperature cycles ( within the spin - glass phase ) @xcite .",
    "the main outcome of the experiments is the coexistence of two seemingly contradictory aspects , namely ` rejuvenation ' upon cooling and ` memory ' upon heating back .",
    "these experiments in spin - glasses have motivated similar experimental studies in other glassy systems including polymer glass @xcite , frozen ferrofluid @xcite , random ferromagnetic system @xcite , random ferroelectric system @xcite and structural glass @xcite .",
    "the rejuvenation effect can be interpreted as a signature of the chaotic change of the underlying equilibrium states as anticipated by the droplet picture .",
    "however the simultaneous memory effect is not obvious to account for within the droplet picture , and the previous attempts have remained unsatisfactory @xcite . the need for some mechanism which allows conservation of large scale spatial structures to preserve memory is now clearly realized @xcite .    on the other hand , there has been recent remarkable progress in the dynamical mean - field theory for glassy systems @xcite .",
    "it was in particular shown within the mean - field theory @xcite that temperature - cycling processes amount to a cycling of break - point @xmath2 which separates the stationary and aging part of the correlation and response functions .",
    "the cycling of @xmath2 can push a part of the stationary signal into the non - stationary regime ( thereby leading to rejuvenation ) , while preserving the rest of the non - stationary part ( memory ) for large enough time scales .",
    "a somewhat similar picture was advocated within a hierarchical phase space picture @xcite , where each level of the hierarchical tree has its own glass temperature .",
    "therefore , a small temperature drop drives a certain level out of equilibrium ( rejuvenation ) while higher level of the tree are frozen ( memory ) @xcite .",
    "an important motivation for this picture is the parisi s replica - symmetry breaking solution for the static properties of mean - field spin - glass models.@xcite this scenario has been recently substantiated by interesting numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "its real - space transcription in terms of a hierarchy of time scales associated with different length scales was developed in @xcite , in particular in the context of pinned domain walls @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we want to go back to the original droplet picture and work out in details the dynamical consequences of chaotic changes of the underlying equilibrium state , and in particular address the question of memory - conservation . to simplify the approach , we restrict ourselves to the simplest scenario for the relaxational dynamics as in @xcite .",
    "namely we assume that relaxational dynamics at any temperature is a coarsening process of the domain walls between an equilibrium pure state and its time - reversal state . as we noted above , changes of temperature amount to complete changes of the equilibrium states beyond @xmath1 in the droplet picture . in order to investigate",
    "the temperature cycling procedures based on the droplet picture , we have studied coarsening subjected to cycling of the underlying equilibrium state which we impose by hand . in the present paper , we disregard possible transient short - time behaviors associated with length scales smaller than @xmath1 and concentrate on the large time phenomena .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , we found that the domain structure corresponding to the different equilibrium states that are encountered can indeed be preserved and retrieved dynamically . we will show that the droplet picture itself can provide a suggestive and interesting scenario for the rejuvenation and memory effects observed in experiments of spin - glasses .",
    "it is known that changes of temperature in a class of frustrated systems can change the effective coupling between certain ` block spins ' due subtle entropy effects , so that interesting re - entrant phase transitions can occur @xcite .",
    "this has motivated a recent work in which somewhat similar ideas for the mechanism of temperature - cycling experiments are presented @xcite .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as the following . in section [ sec : droplet ]",
    "we briefly review the droplet picture which underlies the present study . in section [ sec : scaling ]",
    "we introduce our models and discuss the generic features of coarsening systems subjected to equilibrium states cycling , based on the standard phenomenology of coarsening systems .",
    "in section [ sec.spherical ] we study the dynamics of the @xmath3 mattis model in the spherical limit which is described by a time dependent ginzburg landau ( tdgl ) equation .",
    "we solve the tdgl equation exactly under cycling of equilibrium states and examine the physical picture discussed in section [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "in section [ sec.ising ] we study 2-dimensional ising mattis model by monte carlo simulations to further check our picture . in section [ sec : scenario ] we compare our results with the rejuvenation ( chaos ) and memory effects observed in temperature - cycling experiments in a spin - glass system .",
    "finally , in section [ sec.discussion ] we summarize our result and underline important open questions . in the appendices , we present some technical details of the calculations of the @xmath3 mattis model .",
    "here we briefly review the droplet picture which is the background of the present study . for simplicity",
    "let us consider spin - glasses which have @xmath4 symmetry like ising spin - glasses .",
    "in the droplet picture , it is assumed that there exist only one equilibrium states and its time - reversal state at each temperature below the spin - glass transition temperature @xmath5 . in equilibrium ,",
    "the most important contributions to physical observables such as the magnetic susceptibility comes from thermally activated excitations of compact clusters of spins , called droplets .",
    "let us consider for simplicity the equilibrium state at zero temperature , i.e. the ground state .",
    "the total number of spins at the surface of a droplet of size @xmath6 is postulated to scale typically as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fractal dimension of the surface and @xmath9 is a microscopic length scale . by definition ,",
    "a droplet of size @xmath6 should have a non - zero excitation energy gap .",
    "the excitation energy of the droplet @xmath10 typically scales with @xmath6 as @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the stiffness constant and @xmath13 is the stiffness exponent .",
    "the dynamics of droplets is considered to be a thermally activated process .",
    "the energy barrier @xmath14 to create a droplet is supposed to scales with @xmath6 as @xmath15 with @xmath16 . the relaxation time is given by the arrhenius law , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the attempt time for the activated process .      in the droplet picture ,",
    "small temperature changes cause substantial changes of the equilibrium state .",
    "the argument goes as follows : the entropy associated to a droplet is the sum of contributions which are random in sign over the surface of the droplet .",
    "the latter implies the entropy associated with a droplet of size @xmath6 is random in sign , and of magnitude @xmath19 .",
    "a subtle conjecture is that the ( free-)energy exponent @xmath13 satisfies the inequality @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , a small change of temperature can ruin the balance between energy and entropy .",
    "in particular , the ground state becomes unstable at finite temperatures due to the gain in entropy , and is transformed into a ` new ' equilibrium state that it is completely uncorrelated with the ground state beyond the _ overlap length _ , @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "it is conjectured that this kind of first - order like phase transitions occur continuously within the whole temperature range below @xmath23 .      within the droplet picture@xcite",
    ", the aging of spin - glasses that starts from an out - of - equilibrium initial condition is thought of as a coarsening process , where the domain walls between the two equilibrium states progressively disappear .",
    "the coarsening is driven by successive nucleation and annihilation of droplets . from ( [ eq : arrhenius ] ) , the typical size of droplet which can be thermally activated within a given time scale @xmath24 is expected to scale as , @xmath25^{1/\\psi}. \\label{eq : growth - law}\\ ] ] thus the mean separation of the domain walls after time @xmath24 starting from a random initial condition is also expected to be given by ( [ eq : growth - law ] ) .    while there is no experimental way to observe directly such a domain growth in spin - glasses , ac magnetic susceptibility can be a useful probe . in the droplet picture ,",
    "the ac susceptibility at frequency @xmath26 is considered to be proportional to the inverse of the stiffness @xmath12 of droplet excitations whose size is @xmath27 . during aging ,",
    "the excitation energy gap and hence the effective stiffness is smaller than in complete equilibrium because some droplets of size @xmath27 can happen to share their surface with the `` frozen - in '' droplet of size @xmath28 , and lower their energy . using scaling arguments , the resultant reduction of the stiffness",
    "is obtained as @xmath29 . from the latter ,",
    "the relaxation of the out - of - phase ac susceptibility is obtained as , @xmath30^{-1 } , \\label{eq : droplet - scaling - chi}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the equilibrium susceptibility . for an experimental analysis of the ac - susceptibility based on this scaling ansatz ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "some related analysis was performed also in numerical simulations of the edward - anderson spin - glass model @xcite .",
    "however , the following analysis will not depend on the detailed shape of ( [ eq : droplet - scaling - chi ] ) , but rather on the existence of some general ( inverse ) relation between the ac - susceptibility and the typical size of the non - equilibrium droplets .",
    "an important consequence of thermally activated dynamics is that it induces a natural hierarchy of time scales ( at a given temperature ) and a strong separation of time scales ( between different temperatures)@xcite .",
    "the latter is very useful to understand the temperature cycling experiments in spin - glasses . due to the arrhenius law",
    ", the time needed to cross a certain energy barrier can be extremely different at two different temperatures , say @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the time @xmath34 needed at temperature @xmath32 to jump over a barrier crossed at time @xmath35 at temperature @xmath33 is given by : @xmath36 or : @xmath37 the number of decades separating @xmath34 and @xmath35 is thus equal to the number of decades separating @xmath35 and @xmath38 times @xmath39 . in experiments , the latter is typically @xmath40 or so , so that a @xmath41 temperature change multiplies the time scales by @xmath42 .",
    "note that this separation is much weaker in numerical simulations , where the number of decades separating @xmath35 and @xmath38 is @xmath43 .",
    "it is also useful to consider the separation of length scales .",
    "let us consider two temperatures @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the ratio of the length scale explored at the two temperatures within the same time , say @xmath44 , is obtained from ( [ eq : growth - law ] ) as , @xmath45 one should note that the latter formula does not imply strong separation of length scales : in order to have appreciable separation of length scale , @xmath0 must be comparable to @xmath32 itself .",
    "finally it should be remarked that the time / length separation is even more sharp in reality because the typical energy barriers grow when the temperature is decreased @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as a growth of the stiffness @xcite as , @xmath46",
    "we now start to consider the possible dynamical consequences of the chaos effect within the droplet picture . because we have in mind the temperature - cycling experiments in spin - glasses",
    ", we consider coarsening dynamics under cycling of the underlying equilibrium state . in this section",
    "we discuss intuitively how and when a succession of coarsening with respect to different states can create and store in memory the domain structures of all of them .",
    "some essential aspects of the picture will be verified quantitatively in the following sections , based on some analytical and numerical study of the mattis model .    to be specific ,",
    "let us consider an ising spin model on a lattice in which a spin at site @xmath47 is @xmath48 .",
    "we denote an equilibrium state as @xmath49 and consider that it consists of a spin - configuration @xmath50 where @xmath50 takes @xmath51 randomly with zero mean .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a projection of a spin configuration @xmath52 to the equilibrium state @xmath50 as , @xmath53 projections to two different ground states say @xmath54 and @xmath55 are related as @xmath56    if a uniform external magnetic field @xmath57 is applied to the system , the zeeman energy becomes , @xmath58 where we introduce a random field @xmath59 defined as , @xmath60    in the following , we suppose that the equilibrium state at temperature @xmath61 is a certain configuration @xmath62 , and at temperature @xmath63 is a different configuration @xmath64 ; we suppose that the two states @xmath65 and @xmath66 are completely uncorrelated beyond the overlap length @xmath1 .    concerning experiments , it should be noted that temperature is controlled within certain finite resolution @xmath67 .",
    "thus the overlap length associated with the limited accuracy should be large enough compared with the dynamical length scales explored within some laboratory time scales .",
    "otherwise , neither isothermal aging nor ` cycling ' can even be achieved .",
    "it will be useful to study a specific model which allows coarsening towards various equilibrium states in a transparent way .",
    "in later sections ( section [ sec.spherical ] and [ sec.ising ] ) , we analyze in detail the so called mattis model @xcite , @xmath68 as one can see easily , this model clearly has the spin - configuration @xmath69 as ground states ( for @xmath70 ) .",
    "since this model is equivalent to ferromagnetic models , the relaxational dynamics at low temperatures is nothing but the progressive coarsening of the equilibrium states.@xcite in order to implement the droplet picture more precisely , one could introduce some disorder to the coupling parameter @xmath71 in order to have thermally activated dynamics due to pinning of domain walls @xcite .",
    "the latter does lead to slow growth of the domain as in ( [ eq : growth - law ] ) .",
    "however , we will not perform specific analysis of the decorated model in the present paper .    in section [ sec.spherical ] , we study coarsening of the mattis model in the spherical limit approximation for general spatial dimension @xmath72 , and obtain a fully analytical solution , which we confirm in section [ sec.ising ] by a zero - temperature monte carlo simulation of the mattis model in two - dimension ( @xmath73 ) .      we begin with a simple cycling procedure between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which provides the basic intuition about the coarsening process where the target equilibrium state is cycled .",
    "we first grow the @xmath66 phase with @xmath65 as the initial configuration , and then revert to @xmath65 as the target state .",
    "the coarsening towards @xmath66 given @xmath65 as the initial configuration is a standard coarsening process , because @xmath65 is simply a random configuration with respect to @xmath66 : the projection @xmath76 is random in sign with short range correlation only up to @xmath1 .",
    "we focus on how the symmetry - broken state @xmath65 is affected by this process .",
    "after time @xmath24 , the spin - configuration @xmath77 has coarsened with respect to b : the spatial pattern of the projection @xmath78 consists of domains of @xmath66 and @xmath79 separated by domain walls .",
    "the typical distance between the domain walls is @xmath80 , and increases with time @xmath24 .",
    "[ the growth law @xmath28 depend on temperature @xmath32 in spin - glasses ( see ( [ eq : growth - law ] ) ) . ]",
    "the correlation between the configuration at time @xmath81 and the initial configuration is given by : @xmath82 the last equality is a general property of coarsening systems , and defines the non - equilibrium dynamical exponent @xmath83.@xcite note that we have included the effect of short - range spatial correlations given by @xmath1 in the initial condition .",
    "now let us consider the projection of the spin - configuration @xmath84 onto the initial state @xmath65 .",
    "we expect that the projection @xmath85 are random numbers with only short - ranged spatial correlation . the mean value , however , is nothing but the staggered magnetization @xmath86 with respect to @xmath65 which is non - zero . indeed : @xmath87 where we have used the initial condition @xmath88 , and the simple identity @xmath89 .    to summarize , if one starts from a completely symmetry broken state @xmath65 , the coarsening with respect to a different state @xmath66 adds some noise to @xmath65 , and reduces the magnetization to @xmath90 which decreases with @xmath24 .",
    "however it is very important to note that _ for any finite time @xmath24 the bias is non - zero _ : the symmetry between @xmath65 and @xmath91 remains broken .",
    "we now revert back to @xmath65 as the target state , and evolve the configuration @xmath84 obtained above .",
    "the initial configuration is a random configuration with small bias @xmath92 given in ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "obviously the symmetry - broken state @xmath65 should be finally restored , because the bias is present .",
    "an important question is the time is needed for the recovery .    if the bias @xmath93 has been made sufficiently small , the coarsening with respect to @xmath65 proceeds for a long time almost as if the initial condition was un - biased random configuration with short - range correlation of order @xmath1 : both the majority ( @xmath65 ) and minority ( @xmath91 ) phase coarsen . from the initial condition",
    "@xmath84 the correlation behaves as ( [ eq : lambda ] ) for a long time .",
    "however , in the large time limit , this correlation has to converge to @xmath93 since the state @xmath65 is finally recovered .",
    "the matching between the two regimes allows one to obtain the _ recovery time _",
    "@xmath94 as : @xmath95 this is the characteristic time around which the symmetry - broken state is _ almost _ recovered .",
    "the fact that coarsening with a biased initial condition dies out after a finite time scale has been analyzed analytically in the @xmath3 model.@xcite the mechanism is similar to the interruption of coarsening under finite magnetic field studied analytically in the relaxational dynamics of the spherical sherrington - kirkpatrik mean field spin - glass model @xcite .    now combining ( [ eq : rho ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : recover - noise ] ) , we find a simple relation between the recovery time @xmath94 of a symmetry - broken state and coarsening time @xmath24 with respect to an unrelated phase , @xmath96 note that the role of the overlap - length @xmath1 does not appear explicitly .    here an important point in spin - glasses is that the time @xmath94 can be extremely different from @xmath24 due to the strong separation of time scales ( [ eq : enhanced - separation ] ) discussed above : @xmath97 in the case of negative cycling @xmath98 , the recovery time @xmath94 can be much shorter than the coarsening time @xmath24 .",
    "conversely , for positive cycling @xmath99 , the recovery time @xmath94 can be much larger than @xmath24 .",
    "we now extend the two stage process discussed above to the following three stage process : we first coarsen the system towards @xmath65 for time @xmath100 starting from a totally random initial configuration , unrelated to both @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "subsequently , we take @xmath66 as the target state for a time @xmath101 , and finally coarsen again towards @xmath65 for time @xmath102 . in spirit",
    ", this corresponds to the one - step temperature - cycling protocol used in experiments @xcite .",
    "the results of the previous section corresponds to the limit where @xmath103 .      in the first stage ,",
    "domains of @xmath104 and @xmath105 grow in competition with each other .",
    "after time @xmath100 , the mean distance between the domain walls is @xmath106 , that we suppose much larger than any microscopic length scale @xmath107 and the overlap - length @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ image-0.fig ] we show a picture of the domain structure of a two - dimensional ising mattis model ( see section [ sec.ising ] ) during coarsening .",
    "= 0.45    subsequently the system coarsen towards @xmath66 .",
    "since the spin configuration obtained by the first stage is a random initial configuration with respect to @xmath66 , coarsening of the domains of @xmath108 and @xmath109 starts from the overlap length @xmath1 .",
    "after time @xmath101 , the mean separation of the domain walls is @xmath110 .",
    "( see the upper figure of fig [ image-1-2.fig ] ) .",
    "= 0.45 = 0.45    an interesting way to monitor the time evolution of the spin configuration during the second stage is to use its projection onto @xmath104 .",
    "( see the lower figure of fig [ image-1-2.fig ] ) .",
    "remember that at the end of the first stage , the spin configuration is divided into domains of @xmath104 and @xmath105 separated by domain walls at a distance @xmath106 from each other .",
    "let us consider such a domain as a _ window cell _ to monitor the time evolution of the projection onto @xmath65 during the second stage .",
    "within such a cell , the initial spin configuration is completely polarized with respect either to @xmath104 or to @xmath105 .",
    "then the subsequent time evolution of the spin configuration in the bulk of such a cell should be the same as the case discussed in section [ subsec.noise ] .",
    "thus we expect that the projection to @xmath104 within the cell becomes a random configuration beyond @xmath1 but with a remnant mean bias whose sign is the same as at time @xmath100 .",
    "the amplitude of the bias , however , decreases in magnitude as in ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "to summarize , after time @xmath101 of the second stage , the projection onto @xmath104 ( or @xmath105 ) is a random configuration beyond @xmath1 but with a remnant local bias , @xmath111 the remarkable point is that the _ spatial structure _ of the sign of the bias , coarse - grained over the length @xmath112 is the same as at the end of the first stage .",
    "the ` real ' domain walls of size @xmath112 which separate @xmath104 and @xmath105 at the end of the first stage have been destroyed . however , the ` sign ' of the bias retains the very same spatial structure . for convenience ,",
    "we call the latter ` ghost ' domains .",
    "this is the mechanism to install and conserve memory of the thermal history of the system in the present picture .      in the third stage ,",
    "the state @xmath65 is restored as the target state , given the final configuration of the second stage as the new initial condition .",
    "we continue to monitor the spin configuration using the window cell defined above , of size @xmath106 . from the discussion in section [ subsec.recovery ] , coarsening of @xmath104 and @xmath105 re - starts within the cell .",
    "let us call this regime the _ inner - coarsening _ regime .",
    "how long does this inner - coarsening regime last ?",
    "suppose that the size of the cell @xmath106 , which is the typical length of the spatial structure of the bias field , can be regarded as large enough so that the situation is essentially the same as with an infinitely large system with biased random initial condition ( see [ subsec.noise ] ) .",
    "the inner - coarsening finishes at a recovery time related to the strength of the bias as given as ( [ eq : recover - noise ] ) .",
    "however if the size of the cell @xmath106 is small the inner - coarsening will be interrupted when the size of the new domains reaches that of the cell .",
    "the condition separating these two regimes reads : @xmath113 thus we obtain the life time @xmath94 of the inner - coarsening regime as , @xmath114    let us consider the case a ) more closely . in this case ,",
    "a natural expectation is that after time @xmath94 , the magnitude of the polarization ( bias ) within the bulk of the cell is almost fully recovered .",
    "the latter implies that the ` ghost ' domains of sizes @xmath106 , which are the trace of the real domain constructed in the first stage , become the ` real ' domains again .",
    "the retrieved domain will then re - start to grow just as the continuation of the 1st stage .",
    "we call this regime as _ outer - coarsening regime_.    an important feature is that the domain pattern retrieved after the time @xmath115 will remain almost frozen in the interval @xmath116 $ ] ( see fig .",

    "thus there is a clear separation between the inner - coarsening regime and outer - coarsening regime , when the retrieved domain structure expands appreciably .",

    "the crossover from inner - coarsening to outer - coarsening takes place very smoothly and there is no plateau regime . in this case ` memory ' can not be retrieved because it is impossible to recover the amplitude of the bias with its spatial structure frozen : the shape of the domain at around @xmath117 will be already different from installed one .    to summarize , the separation of the inner - coarsening and outer - coarsening regime is different in the case a ) and b ) . combining ( [ eq : condition - a - b ] ) and",

    "we obtain a very simple condition : @xmath120 thus the separation between the inner- and outer - coarsening regimes in the third regime depends on relative domain size in the first and second stages .",
    "finally , let us note for completeness what is happening on the projection onto @xmath66 during the 3rd stage : the projection onto @xmath66 is becoming more and more noisy but still the ghost domains of size @xmath110 , which is the remnant of the real domains of @xmath66 created in the second state , remain .",

    "this feature can be observed only if the frequency @xmath26 of the ac field is large enough compared with the inverse lifetime of the inner - coarsening regime , @xmath132    on the other hand , in the outer - coarsening regime the relevant domain is that of the revived ghost domains . thus in the latter regime , the relevant size of the domain is simply @xmath133 and the relaxation of the ac - susceptibility is the continuation of the first stage as if the second stage were absent .",
    "this can be observed if the experiment is continued up to large enough time @xmath102 compared with the lifetime of the inner - coarsening regime , @xmath134    = 0.6    we summarize the generic behavior of the relaxation of the out - of - phase ac - susceptibility in the one - step cycling procedure in fig .",
    "[ concept-one-step-ac.fig ] . here",
    "a very important remark is that the strong separation of time scale ( [ eq : enhanced - separation ] ) in spin - glasses due to the activated dynamics can explain the strong differences in the third regime between negative and positive cycling observed in experiment ( this point was emphasized in @xcite ) . in the case of negative cycling , the outer - coarsening regime can be easily observed but the lifetime of the inner - coarsening regime can be so short that ( [ eq : cond - inner - coarsening ] ) is not satisfied . on the contrary , positive cycling makes the inner - coarsening regime easily observed ( rejuvenation ) but its effect is rapidly too large to allow the observation of some ` memory ' . as we will discuss later in section",
    "[ sec : scenario ] , the experimental data can be ( at least qualitatively ) interpreted along these lines .",

    "here we are assuming the case a ) @xmath155 which allows clear separation between the inner- and outer - coarsening regimes .",
    "the initial decay is that due to the inner - coarsening regime , ( @xmath156 ) where the correlation decays as if the memory of the first stage was completely lost .",
    "the remarkable feature is the plateau regime @xmath157 , where the correlation function stays almost constant .",
    "the subsequent drop is due to the outer coarsening @xmath158 where the correlation function decays as if the second stage is absent .",
    "but here the amplitude is reduced from 1 to @xmath93 .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath159 , the second relaxation does not occur @xmath160 .",

    "the auto correlation corresponding to the dc - magnetic susceptibilities is now @xmath161 with non - zero @xmath162 .",
    "the behavior becomes more complicated because the noise is already removed to a certain extent during the additional period @xmath102 thus the effect of rejuvenation tends to be obscured .",
    "nonetheless we explicitly compute such an auto - correlation function in section [ subsubsec.c - third-2 ] and later compare with experimental curves in section [ sec : scenario ] .",

    "one can naturally extend the one step cycling to multiple steps cycling of the equilibrium states trying to mimic continuous temperature - cycling experiments @xcite .",

    "if one skips the 2nd coarsening of @xmath66 and try to remove the noise by doing only the 2nd coarsening of @xmath65 , the time need for the recovery @xmath94 will become astronomically large , @xmath175 thus it is very important that the multiplicative noise is cured in two steps and not by a single stroke .",

    "furthermore there is an intermediate regime which we called ` plateau regime ' in section [ subsec.double ] so that rejuvenation and memory effects can be observed in a well separated manner .",

    "next we discuss the case b ) @xmath314 : the duration of the first stage is much shorter than that of the second stage . in this case",
    "we find that the two contributions defined in ( [ eq : mf - para ] ) and ( [ eq : tilde - m - para ] ) become essentially equal @xmath326 since @xmath297 holds as one can see in ( [ eq : def - a ] ) .",
    "thus the basic structure of the correlation function ( [ eq : spatial - c - third - gene ] ) can be again naturally interpreted as a sum of gaussian packet due to the domain of inner - coarsening ( rejuvenation ) whose size is @xmath316 and that due to the continuation of the ` ghost domain ' ( memory ) of size @xmath317 .",
    "however , the amplitude of the memory terms @xmath327 does not recover much and only saturate to a small value @xmath328 as @xmath329 ( @xmath312 ) . in the latter regime ,",
    "the width of the memory and rejuvenation terms become of the same order , @xmath330 thus the correlation function crossovers very smoothly to the asymptotic outer - coarsening regime ( [ eq : spatial - c - outer - coarsening ] ) so that the memory can not be retrieved .",

    "such a feature can be elucidated by considering overlap @xmath332 between the configuration just after the first stage and the temporal configuration in the third stage .",
    "it is readily obtained as , @xmath333 in the last equation we used the ratio @xmath307 defined in ( [ eq : mb - para ] ) and @xmath154 is the auto - correlation function of standard coarsening ( [ eq : c ] ) .",

    "the competing effects of the inner - coarsening and outer - coarsening make the overlap @xmath336 non - monotonic in time @xmath102 . in the case",

    "as we discussed in section [ subsec.dc-one-step ] , the auto correlation function can be related with the dc - magnetic susceptibilities measured in experiments .",

    "as far as time separation is wide enough so that the plateau regime is allowed , the recovery time @xmath94 is much shorter than @xmath100 . within the plateau regime @xmath372 .",
    "remarkably , then the above formula ( [ eq : u - turn-2-step ] ) implies that the noise onto @xmath49 due to @xmath371 coarsening is also cured thanks to the 2nd @xmath198-coarsening and the remnant noise is now only that due to @xmath198 phase .",
    "but if one perform the 2nd @xmath198-coarsening too long , the factor @xmath369 will begin to decrease further meaning that the noise due to @xmath198 coarsening will now begin to affect the projection to @xmath49 .",

    "otherwise experimental temperature becomes meaningless .",
    "indeed , there are some data which suggest that @xmath1 depends on @xmath0 @xcite . for example",
    "the data of negative cycling between very close temperatures @xmath405 of the insulating spin - glass shown in @xcite reveals that the relaxation during the second stage at @xmath406 k ` helps ' relaxation at @xmath392 to a certain extent .",
    "let us now consider the relaxation of the thermo - remanent magnetization ( trm ) , which is a dc susceptibility , after similar one - step cycling .",
    "a representative data set is shown in fig .",
    "[ trm.fig ] which is taken from @xcite . here",
    "a positive temperature cycling @xmath407 is done under small magnetic field which is then cut - off . then the subsequent relaxation of the magnetization is measured . here",
    "the duration of the second stage is fixed to @xmath408 minutes but the amplitude of the shift @xmath0 is varied .",
    "now let us compare the experimental data with the correlation function after a one - step cycling in the @xmath3 mattis model , which we analyzed in section [ subsubsec.c - third-2 ] .",
    "here we suppose that the generic features of the correlation function and trm decay are similar .",
    "it should however be noted that this is not obvious since the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) in such non - stationary situations @xcite does not allow an exact identification of the two quantities .",
    "second , we again disregard the possible finite value of @xmath1 between the different equilibrium states at different temperatures and consider that they are completely uncorrelated",
    ".    the activated dynamics ( [ eq : growth - law ] ) implies that for larger @xmath0 , the coarsening in the second stage reaches larger length scales @xmath409 , so that more ` noise ' is added to the @xmath392 domain structure .",
    "thus we suppose that larger @xmath0 in the experiment corresponds to larger @xmath101 in our model .",
    "indeed the experimental curves shown in fig [ trm.fig ] appear to be very similar to the result in the @xmath3 mattis model shown in fig .",
    "[ on_c_3.fig ] .    in section [ subsubsec.c - third-2 ]",
    ", we found that the generic features of the auto - correlation function can be understood as crossover from rejuvenation ( inner coarsening ) to memory ( outer - coarsening ) .",
    "this crossover is sharp only in the case a ) where the second stage is effectively much shorter than the first stage ( @xmath410 ) . on the other hand , in the case",
    "b ) where the second stage is effectively much longer than the first stage , rejuvenation is nearly complete .",
    "let us note that the curve in fig.[on_c_3.fig ] with @xmath411 belongs to the case b ) because the effective time ( [ eq : enhanced - separation ] ) of @xmath408 minutes at @xmath412 amounts to @xmath413 min at 12k ( with @xmath414 ( sec ) ) , which is very large compared with @xmath415 min . on the other hand , @xmath416 and @xmath417 can be considered as cases of a ) since their effective time @xmath418 min and @xmath419 min at 12k are smaller than @xmath420 .",
    "it would be very interesting to look experimentally for the plateau regime as seen in fig.[on_c_1.fig ] , [ on_c_2.fig ] , [ on_c_3.fig ] and fig .",
    "[ tw0-tw1=20.fig ] , [ tw0=1000-inf.fig ] .",
    "= 0.6      finally let us consider the multiple - step ( continuous ) version of the temperature cycling which has been studied in recent experiments @xcite using the out - of - phase ac susceptibility @xmath356 .",
    "here we discuss based on the scenario we developed in section [ subsec.multi ] . in fig .",
    "[ continuous.fig ] an example of the data taken from @xcite is shown .",
    "the basic schedule is a negative - cycling which consist of cooling and heating procedure . in the cooling",
    ", the temperature is reduced successively by ` micro - quenches ' of small temperature step @xmath0 , @xmath421 with ( @xmath422 ) where @xmath423 is the starting temperature and @xmath185 is the number of steps . at every temperature @xmath424 a short period of time @xmath425",
    "is spent . in this experiment , @xmath426 and @xmath427 @xcite . in the heating .",
    "the temperature is raised back successively by the same @xmath0 with a the same period @xmath428 at each temperature .    within the present scenario , coarsening of new phases",
    "are expected at every temperature in the cooling and the heating is the revered order series of coarsening . note that the above basic schedule satisfies the condition ( [ eq : retrieval - condition ] ) to retrieve the memory at each temperature in the heating .",
    "for instance ( [ eq : recover - noise - cycle ] ) implies the noise due to @xmath429 min at @xmath430 k on the phase at @xmath431 k can be erased quickly within @xmath432 ( min ) .",
    "indeed , it is found in the experiment that the reference curve of cooling and heating lie close to each other @xcite . concerning the frequency of ac @xmath433 ( hz ) ,",
    "we need to suppose that it is low enough so that the signal of the cleaning ( inner - coasting ) does not blur the observation of the memory .    in the experiment ,",
    "an interesting modification is made for the cooling procedure : now two special temperatures ( @xmath434 and @xmath435 k ) are chosen to make relatively long stops @xmath436 hours in stead of the short period @xmath437 min .",
    "but all the rest of the basic schedule is unchanged .",
    "the dips in cooling curve mean relaxation due to the long aging .",
    "then the fact that the cooling curve tend to return to the reference curve ( without stops ) after the long stops implies coarsening of the new phase within the present scenario .",
    "let us the consider the heating curve .",
    "as the temperature comes up to the stop temperature @xmath434 k , the curve goes downward tracing the cooling curve .",
    "the latter is expected within the present scenario since as soon as the noise due to coarsening at lower temperatures are erased , we are left with the large ghost domain at @xmath434 k with its full amplitude recovered .",
    "the same phenomena happens also for @xmath435k .",
    "the phases at the temperatures just above @xmath434 k and @xmath435 k are expected to be very noisy due to the long stops .",
    "the latter belongs to the case b ) discussed in section [ sec.one-step-third ] and their memory may be hardly retrieved .",
    "then the increase of the heating curve after passing the stop temperatures may be interpreted as the signal of inner - coarsening ( rejuvenation ) .",
    "furthermore , the long stop at @xmath434 k of @xmath438 hours could have affected the memory at @xmath435k .",
    "however , its effective time turns out to be only @xmath439 sec at @xmath435 k. if the stop temperatures are closer , the recovery of memory could have been affected more .",
    "such a phenomena is indeed observed in some experiments @xcite .",
    "finally let us also note that the dips are rounded in the experimental data , while we would have expected sharper dips . in the present scenario ,",
    "the rounding of the dips may be attributed to finiteness of the overlap length .",
    "the basis of our approach in the present study is the droplet picture .",
    "the fundamental ingredients of the present paper are the tenets of the droplet theory , namely : i ) for a given temperature below the critical temperature , there are only two equilibrium states related by a global flip ; ii ) the relaxational dynamics is the coarsening of the domains of these equilibrium states .",
    "the growth of the domains is due to the thermal activation of droplets ; iii ) the underlying equilibrium states change chaotically with weak external perturbations , such as a change of temperature .    by a combination of scaling arguments , analytical calculations and numerical simulations ,",
    "we have demonstrated _ preservation and retrieval of memory _ is possible in a very dynamical way in the absence of any underlying static backbone structure .",
    "first , we showed that _ preservation of memory _ is possible by ` ghost domains ' ( domain wall structure plus noise ) of _ all _ the phases the system goes through in the temporal spin - configuration . here coexistence of statistically independent domains only amount to mutual injection of uncorrelated short - range noise which do not destroy large scale spatial structures of each other . thus in order to describe the spin - configuration , one needs to keep track of the projections to all phases . in this sense , there are indeed many ` phases ' in the temporal spin - configuration , as already anticipated in the experimental studies @xcite .",
    "then we studied in detail _ retrieval of memory _ : how the noise on a phase due to coexistence of the domain structures of other phases can be removed by additional conjugate coarsening .",
    "the analysis has been carried out explicitly in term of various spatial / temporal correlation functions and linear response functions . in particular , we have shown that when the time spent in the intermediate state is sufficiently small , rejuvenation effects and memory effects can be observed in a well separated manner . there",
    "the difficulty of the previous works @xcite to explain the ` memory effect ' , is resolved .",
    "it is rather surprising to find that the simplest version of the droplet picture already allows coherent and rather rich phenomenology which can account for experiments at least qualitatively .",
    "the droplet picture itself is based on phenomenological scaling arguments and migdal - kadanoff type real - space renormalization - group calculations @xcite .",
    "it is by no means obvious that real spin - glasses can be described within this simple scenario .",
    "many papers have appeared recently , presenting relatively strong evidence against the simplest version of the droplet theory @xcite . on the other hand evidence for the validity of the basic droplet picture",
    "has also been provided @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we have focused on the simplest version of the droplet theory .",
    "any modifications due to possible corrections to the simplest version go beyond the scope of the present paper and we leave this issue for future studies .",
    "the theoretical situation of temperature chaos is also far from being settle neither in low dimensional systems nor in mean - field models .",
    "early numerical investigations at finite temperatures @xcite suggest chaos with magnetic field and with the change of couplings . temperature chaos has been found in 2-d edwards - anderson model @xcite for very large length scales .",
    "temperature chaos has also been suggested by some analytical studies of mean - field models @xcite .",
    "however recent simulations of both the sk and the 3-d edwards - anderson models have concluded on the absence of chaos with temperature @xcite ( as also suggested by another analytical calculation for the sk model @xcite ) .",
    "but there is still a possibility that temperature - chaos was not observed in the latter because the overlap length is larger than the system sizes studied .",
    "chaotic changes of equilibrium states have also been looked for other related glassy systems .",
    "for instance , a large scale transfer - matrix study of an elastic string pinned in random media @xcite , which describes for instance pinned domain walls , has found some evidence for the chaotic change of the free - energy landscape with temperature again for very large length scales .",
    "all studies therefore suggest that ` chaos ' , if it exists , only occurs on large length scales , whereas the dynamical length is expected to be modest , even in experimental studies @xcite , due to its very slow growth with time .",
    "let us now briefly compare the present scenario based on the droplet picture with another phenomenology @xcite , based on a dynamical interpretation of the parisi solution of the sk ( mean - field ) model , which suggests that the energy landscape is hierarchical .",
    "a concrete implementation of this picture was proposed in @xcite , in terms of a thermally activated generalized random - energy model ( grem ) .",
    "to each level of the hierarchical tree is associated a transition temperature , such that the dynamics at this level is stationary for higher temperatures , and aging for smaller temperatures .",
    "a small decrease of temperature induces some rejuvenation by driving out of equilibrium a new level of the tree , while freezing out the dynamics at the upper levels , thereby allowing the memory to be conserved .",
    "this model was recently studied further in @xcite , where it is shown numerically that the rejuvenation / memory effect is indeed already reproduced with two levels .    a real space interpretation of this hierarchical tree proposed in @xcite , and further developed in @xcite , in terms of a multi - scale dynamics .",
    "low levels of the tree corresponds to short wavelength modes , which are only frozen at low temperature , while large wavelengths modes are frozen at a higher temperature and constitute the ` backbone ' where the memory is imprinted .",
    "the picture is particularly clear in the context of pinned domains walls @xcite , and should apply to disordered ferromagnets where the slow dynamics comes from the motion of these pinned domain walls @xcite",
    ".    a closer look at the two different scenarios shows that they actually share several important points . the fact that the dynamics is thermally activated is crucial in both pictures , as it provides a natural separation of time scales for different length scales and/or temperatures . as was pointed out in @xcite , for a given experimental time window , temperature acts as a microscope by selecting the relevant dynamical length scales .",
    "the way memory is conserved is therefore common in both approaches : it is stored in large length scales which are to a large extent unaffected by the small length scale dynamics taking place at lower temperatures .",
    "however it should be noted that in the droplet picture , there is no _ static _ backbone structure in the phase space and",
    "the memory is entirely a dynamical effect .",
    "the mechanism leading to rejuvenation is therefore different in the two pictures : in the droplet picture , it is due to a complete modification of the free energy landscape with temperature , whereas in the hierarchical picture it is due to the progressive freezing of smaller and smaller wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this picture is consistent with the simulations of @xcite : a broad peak in the overlap probability at high temperature is resolved into sharper and sharper sub - peaks as the temperature is lowered , with no overall shift .",
    "one should finally note that comparable rejuvenation / memory effects have now been seen in very different materials , such as pmma @xcite , where the droplet model is probably not the appropriate picture . in this respect ,",
    "the idea of progressive freezing of smaller and smaller length scales is perhaps more generic .      in the present paper , we discussed experimental data only qualitatively .",
    "more detailed and critical examinations of the scenario developed in the present paper should be done .",
    "it would be very interesting to look for the plateau regime which separates the rejuvenation and memory both in experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "a crucial difference between the two pictures is therefore the existence of an overlap length @xmath1 in the droplet picture .",
    "the role of this length ( that we have neglected in the present paper to focus on the phenomena on larger time scales ) should show up when the temperature change is very small ( or equivalently shorter time scales are considered ) , and therefore be important to account for the possible cooling rate effects @xcite in spin - glasses .",
    "we hope to come back to this important point in the future .",
    "we have furthermore neglected the fact that the energy barriers are expected to be temperature dependent in the droplet picture through the temperature dependence of the stiffness ( [ eq : stiffness - temp ] ) .",
    "this leads to a super - activated behavior of the time scales , as was seen in @xcite , that needs to be quantitatively accounted for @xcite .",
    "if chaotic change of equilibrium states can be made by non - thermal perturbations like change of magnetic field @xcite or pressure , they will also provide useful means to examine the present scenario .",
    "temperature changes may be used simultaneously to enhance the time separations .",
    "if the present picture is correct , such a non - thermal perturbation at @xmath440 should induce the growth of domains on very short length scales , an effect that can be erased quickly by heating up the system .",
    "therefore , complete memory should also be observed in a protocol where : @xmath441 and the strength of the strength of non - thermal perturbation @xmath442 is changed as @xmath443 simultaneously .",
    "another good testing ground for the two approaches may be systems with pinned - domain walls which is intimately related with the problem of elastic manifolds in random media @xcite whose dynamics show aging effects @xcite .",
    "as we noted above a very natural scenario can be obtained by a grem based approach @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also straightforward to construct a scenario based on a droplet picture @xcite for this problem in a way similar to our present work .",
    "a suitable toy model corresponding to the spherical mattis model we studied here is the elastic manifold pinned by quenched random force field ( larkin model ) subjected to cycling of the realization of the random force field . concerning this issue , it is interesting to note that recent experiments on disordered ferromagnets and ferro - electrics have revealed several similarities with spin - glasses @xcite .",
    "a discouraging point of the numerical approach is that the separation of time scales can not be made so dramatic like in experiments of spin - glasses .",
    "however , possible differences between experiments and simulations due to such a difference of time scales should be amenable to a quantitative analysis .",
    "one of the great advantages of the numerical approach is that one can directly obtain the size of the domains @xmath28 at each time step using a spatial correlation functions between two real replicas .",
    "@xcite then the scaling ansatz presented in the present paper can be tested very precisely since everything can be expressed in terms of the size of the domains @xmath28 .",
    "indeed this approach has been very useful to test some scaling ansatz by the droplet picture @xcite for isothermal aging.@xcite furthermore , combined with an analysis on equilibrium properties around and below the critical temperature @xcite , this kind of approach allows one to quantitatively analyze possible crossovers between critical and low - temperature behaviors in the dynamical observables and in the domain growth law itself .",
    "@xcite    it is important to note that due thermally activated processes which presumably dominate relaxational dynamics in spin - glass like systems , the _ length scales _ explored in simulations are actually very small .",
    "this might be the reason why rejuvenation / memory effects are hard to observe numerically @xcite , because both the above scenarios rely on the existence of non overlapping ( in length scales ) dynamical processes .",
    "the fact that the growth law is so slow also implies that both experiments and simulations will never be in the _ ideal _ regime of asymptotically large length scales to test the scaling predictions of droplet picture . whether one can observe some clear signatures of the droplet picture within a realistic time scale",
    "may then depend very much on details of the systems studied in experiments and simulations .",
    "whether the usual edwards - anderson model is the best model to describe real spin - glass systems is now hotly discussed.@xcite    we want to thank e. vincent for the permission to use the curves of the series of experiments in saclay , useful discussions and encouragement .",
