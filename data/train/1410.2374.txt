    "the spectacular collapse of the tacoma narrows bridge ( occurred on november 7 , 1940 , see @xcite ) raised many questions on the instability of suspension bridges .",
    "soon after the collapse , several theoretical and experimental studies have been performed @xcite .",
    "the main issue was to understand the origin of the instability @xcite and , in particular , how could vertical oscillations be suddenly transformed into destructive torsional oscillations .",
    "the focus was essentially on the aerodynamic instability @xcite but no conclusive answer was found : in the last few years , the problem of aerodynamic instability of suspension bridges is still under study @xcite . only very recently",
    ", the attention has turned to the nonlinear behavior of structures @xcite .    in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the structural instability of suspension bridges has been highlighted by analyzing two fairly different isolated models . in @xcite",
    "the bridge was seen as a number of interacting parallel rods representing the cross sections of the bridge , each one having two degrees of freedom : the vertical displacement of the barycenter and the torsional angle .",
    "a torsional instability was numerically found : if vertical displacements are sufficiently large then small torsional angles may suddenly grow up leading to the collapse of the bridge .",
    "the main tools to reach this result were suitable poincar maps @xcite . see also @xcite for some aerodynamics effects . in @xcite",
    "the bridge was modeled as a degenerate plate , named fish - bone by the authors , where the midline of the plate was seen as a beam and virtual orthogonal cross sections were considered free to rotate about their center placed on the beam .",
    "see also @xcite where the aerodynamic forces were introduced in the model .",
    "the same torsional instability was found , both numerically and theoretically , and the instability was justified through the analysis of suitable hill equations @xcite .",
    "it is clear that there is a relation between these two models and approaches .",
    "this is probably due to the connection between poincar and hill , as testified in @xcite ; their work takes the origin from celestial mechanics and , as we just saw , it applies as well to suspension bridges . the results in @xcite lead to the very same conclusion :",
    "if vertical oscillations are small enough then small initial torsional oscillations remain small for all the time , whereas if vertical oscillations are large then small torsional oscillations can suddenly become wider .",
    "this gives an answer to a long - standing question raised by the tacoma narrows bridge collapse , see @xcite , namely how can destructive torsional oscillations suddenly appear in a vertically oscillating bridge .",
    "the main core in both @xcite is the stability analysis of vertical modes , that is , how can a bridge oscillating as an almost pure vertical mode suddenly transfer part of the energy to a torsional mode .",
    "we investigate this phenomenon by considering a class of second order hamiltonian systems such as + _ i^2y_i+u_y_i(y)=0 , y=(y_1,  ,y_n)^n for some @xmath0 , @xmath1 and some potential @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the partial derivative of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "the heart of the matter is to study the evolution of the solutions of satisfying the initial conditions y_1(0)=_0 ,  _ 1(0)=_1 , _",
    "i=2^n(|y_i(0)|+|_i(0)|)|_0|+|_1| for @xmath6 ; due to these uneven boundary conditions , we call @xmath7 the _ dominating mode _ and @xmath5 ( for @xmath8 ) the _ residual modes_. and the main question is to establish if the unique solution @xmath9 of - has small residual modes for every time @xmath10 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this is true provided that @xmath11 is sufficiently small whereas it may become false if @xmath11 is sufficiently large .",
    "the typical pictures describing the instability of - are as in figure [ typical ] .        in both pictures ,",
    "the gray oscillations represent the dominating mode whereas the black oscillations represent the largest component among the residual modes . in the left picture , the initial data @xmath12 and @xmath13 in are small and the only large component of @xmath14 is @xmath7 for all @xmath10 , no black oscillations are visible . in the right picture",
    ", the initial data @xmath12 and @xmath13 in are larger and one may see a large oscillation also in one of the residual modes : this mode suddenly grows up by capturing some energy from @xmath7 which decreases its amplitude of oscillation when the transfer of energy occurs .",
    "this is what we call instability of @xmath7 ( for large energies ) and it can be seen for many different forms of the potential @xmath4 in , see @xcite .",
    "a question was left open in @xcite : which residual mode first captures the energy of @xmath7 ?",
    "moreover , which is the criterion governing the transfer of energy ?",
    "the relevance of these questions relies on the possibility to understand which kind of oscillating mode will first appear in the bridge when enough energy is inside the structure . in particular , this could help to prevent the appearance of the destructive torsional oscillations .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to give a sound answer to these questions .",
    "we consider a simple prototype problem like - with @xmath15 .",
    "we choose a potential @xmath4 in such a way that the linearized problem becomes a system of mathieu equations @xcite , which are a particular case of the hill equations .",
    "the advantage of this choice is that much more precise information is known on the behavior of the stability regions .",
    "exploiting this fact we give a detailed explanation of how the stability is lost for the dominating mode of and which residual mode first captures its energy . notice that by @xcite we know that several different choices of @xmath4 yield a similar response in the bridge .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ] we state the theoretical criterion governing the energy transfer between modes and in section [ somenumres ]",
    "we collect several numerical experiments which confirm and illustrate the theoretical results . in section",
    "[ different ] we discuss different choices of the potential @xmath4 . finally , in section [ mec ] we give a mechanical interpretation of the numerical results and we suggest some structural remedies to prevent instability in suspension bridges .",
    "for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 being positive real numbers , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we consider the following problem @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a non - negative , differentiable function with locally lipschitz derivatives , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 stand for its partial derivatives with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the conserved total energy of is given by @xmath27    along the paper , we mainly deal with the potential u(y , z_1,z_2)= , see section [ different ] for a discussion about different choices . with the potential @xmath4 as in , system becomes \\",

    "a theoretical explanation of this fact comes from the classical stability theory for the mathieu equation .",

    "we found that the dominating mode @xmath25 captured some small amount of energy from the residual mode @xmath119 .",

    "we suspect that , again , the ratios @xmath187 play a major role .",

    "this alternative depends on the ratios @xmath187 .",

    "we analyzed in particular the two first instability regions .",

    "second ) instability region for small enough @xmath65 if @xmath214 therefore , we considered couples such as @xmath215 and @xmath216 for @xmath85 sufficiently small and we could observe the following facts .",
    "_ if the couple @xmath68 lies in the instability region of the mathieu diagram , then the instability of the trivial solution of increases with the distance of the couple @xmath68 from the stability regions .",
    "_        we can however expect that the residual modes start growing up earlier in time and wider in amplitude if the parameters are far from the stability region .",
    "this is precisely what we saw in our experiments , see figure [ primaterna ] . in particular , when the parametric lines reach and intersect a thin instability region ( one of the cusps close to some @xmath219 with @xmath0 ) , the parameters are so close to the stability region that the energy inhibits the residual modes to capture a significant amount of energy . from the physical point of view , the instability which occurs when the lines cross a thin cusp is irrelevant , both because it has low probability to occur and because , even if it occurs , the residual mode remains fairly small . in turn , from the mechanical point of view , we know that small torsional oscillations are harmless and the bridge would remain safe . summarizing ,",
    "we conclude that      from the mathieu diagram and from the asymptotic expansions of the characteristic curves , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 2.151 ) , we learn that the instability regions become more narrow as @xmath219 increases .",
