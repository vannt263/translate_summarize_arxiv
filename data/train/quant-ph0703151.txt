    "entanglement of spatially separate quantum systems holds an important role both in the investigation of quantum theory foundations @xcite and in quantum information and computation processing @xcite .",
    "manifestations of quantum nonlocal properties of entangled distant systems can be characterized by bell s inequality violations @xcite .",
    "therefore , for their striking quantum nonlocal properties and their possible applications , entangled quantum systems are subject of intense study in several contexts .    in particular , in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) several schemes",
    "have been proposed to generate entangled number states in two separate single - mode high-@xmath0 cavities , the cavities having zero or one photon @xcite .",
    "there are some proposals to prove bell s inequality violations for such states @xcite but an experimental test has not yet been made .",
    "it appears also of interest to obtain entanglement between electromagnetic field states with mesoscopic characteristics , so that the classical - quantum border may be approached .",
    "this is possible , for example , if the electromagnetic field states present non - zero mean fields .",
    "this fact seems to exclude the number states , and some schemes to generate entangled coherent states in two separate cavities have been then proposed @xcite .",
    "however , since two different coherent states are never orthogonal , entangled states of this kind can not be made totally distinguishable .",
    "therefore , it may be useful to have entangled states in separate cavities formed by field states that present non - zero mean fields , are orthogonal and can be obtained by standard resonant interactions of two - level atoms with the cavities",
    ".    nonclassical states of electromagnetic field suited for this goal are , for example , the generalized binomial states @xcite .",
    "these states , characterized by a finite maximum number of photons @xmath1 , interpolate between the coherent state and the number state and present non - zero mean electric fields .",
    "moreover , for each @xmath1-photon generalized binomial state ( @xmath1gbs ) it is always possible to find an orthogonal one @xcite . for large @xmath1",
    ", these states thus present mesoscopic properties .",
    "the point remains on how to generate entangled orthogonal couples of these binomial states and characterize their nonlocal properties .",
    "it has been recently indicated how both entangled 1gbss and 2gbss @xcite can be generated in two separate cavities by resonant atom - cavity interactions . in the one - photon case ,",
    "the electric field correlations of the two cavities have been analyzed and bell s inequality violations are shown to be observable @xcite .    since entangled 2gbss may be generated , it appears of interest to analyze their nonlocal properties and compare them with the ones of the one - photon case .",
    "this constitutes the aim of this paper .",
    "in particular , we shall examine the correlations of electric field for entangled 2gbss and , by introducing an appropriate dichotomic cavity operator , we also construct a bell s inequality that it is shown to be violated for a wide range of the degree of entanglement and is amenable to an experimental verification .",
