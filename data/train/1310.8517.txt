    "<S> we report a diversity of stable gap solitons in a spin - orbit coupled bose - einstein condensate subject to a spatially periodic zeeman field . it is shown that the solitons , can be classified by the main physical symmetries they obey , i.e. symmetries with respect to parity ( p ) , time ( t ) , and internal degree of freedom , i.e. spin , ( c ) inversions . the conventional gap and gap - stripe solitons are obtained in lattices with different parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that solitons of the same type but obeying different symmetries can exist in the same lattice at different spatial locations . </S>",
    "<S> pt and cpt symmetric solitons have anti - ferromagnetic structure and are characterized respectively by nonzero and zero total magnetizations .    </S>",
    "<S> the progressively growing interest in the physics of mixtures of spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and in particular in spin - orbit ( so ) coupled becs ( so - becs )  @xcite , is motivated on the one hand by their fundamental importance for the atomic physics , and on the other hand by the rich possibilities they offer for emulating synthetic electric and magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the last property allows one using neutral atoms to simulate numerous condensed matter phenomena  @xcite in a tunable way , what would be impossible in direct condensed matter experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the physics of becs is characterized by two essential factors , first , a bec is a nonlinear system , with the nonlinearity stemming from the two - body interactions  @xcite . moreover , by changing the configuration of the system ( i.e. of the laser beams ) one can create effective nonlinear interactions of different types  @xcite . respectively , such nonlinear objects as skyrmions  @xcite , solitons  @xcite , anti - ferromagnetic structures and symmetry breaking  @xcite , have been recently reported for so - becs . </S>",
    "<S> the second feature , is that a ( quasi- ) stationary state of the condensate requires the presence of the external potential . </S>",
    "<S> this , in particular , imposes constraints on the lower bound of the kinetic energy , what is particularly relevant for so - becs ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> what concerns the external potentials , since the very first experiments with cold atoms loaded in optical lattices  @xcite it was widely recognized that lattices ( i.e. periodic potentials ) are particularly efficient in manipulating becs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays , the nonlinear properties of the atomic becs held in optical lattices , described in the mean - field approximation are very well studied  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a brief review on bec mixtures in optical lattices ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural that studies of so - becs in periodic potentials were already initiated . </S>",
    "<S> manipulations with the band - gap structure  @xcite and vortex lattice states  @xcite supported by so coupling and optical lattices have being reported .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand a few years ago there have been initiated studies of the properties of electronic gas with rashba  @xcite and dresselhaus  @xcite so coupling in periodic structures . </S>",
    "<S> those studies included the effect of dimensionality and features of the band - gap structures of a gas in a superimposed periodic and arbitrary confining potentials  @xcite , ballistic transport of electrons in periodic magnetic field  @xcite , switching controlled by so coupling  @xcite , and quantum wire superlattices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that so coupling induced by an external periodic field leads to the appearance of new gaps , making the electronic system tunable even in the condensed matter settings .    </S>",
    "<S> even more recently , the so coupling was emulated in experiments with light propagating in arrays optical waveguides  @xcite , thus opening a root towards new physical systems where the interplay of so coupling and nonlinearity ( if waveguides are of the kerr type ) can result in novel optical phenomena .    bearing in mind the described findings it is natural to address the effect of the lattice induced by such a field on the _ nonlinear _ properties of so - becs . </S>",
    "<S> , classified with respect to their parity ( p ) , time ( t ) , and pseudo - charge ( c ) symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potentials of the solitons originate from different gaps in the spectrum of the magnetic lattice for both attractive and repulsive interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> we address one - dimensional ( 1d ) mixture of a two - component so - bec which is described by a spinor @xmath0col@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for a tripod - type atomic scheme , like the one considered in  @xcite , the components @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the wavefunctions of the two dark states emulating ( pseudo-)spins @xmath4 and @xmath5 . adopting the units where @xmath6 , and taking into account that the difference between spin - independent and spin - dependent two - body interactions can be made as small as necessary ( in  @xcite the difference was of order of 1% of the interaction magnitude ) we explore the hamiltonian of the system in the form @xmath7 where the linear hamiltonian @xmath8 accounts for the periodically modulated zeeman field @xmath9 and for so coupling with the strength @xmath10 ( which depends on the angle between optical beams and can be tuned  @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath11sign@xmath12 characterizes the of two - body interactions with the scattering length @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear dynamics of the condensate is then governed by the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) @xmath15    we are interested in the stationary solutions having the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a chemical potential and @xmath18 solves the stationary coupled gpes . for the sake of definiteness , we consider a particular form of the zeeman field @xmath19,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the average and the modulation amplitude of the field , respectively , and without loss of generality the period is taken to be @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless we emphasize that the approach developed below is valid for more generic forms of zeeman fields obeying the symmetries specified below .    </S>",
    "<S> first we take into account that @xmath9 is an even function , @xmath23 and obtain that if @xmath18 is a solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gpe ] ) then the spinor @xmath24 ( an overbar stands for the complex conjugation ) defined by the parity and time inversions  @xcite , is a solutions of the stationary gpes , as well . </S>",
    "<S> at @xmath25 the field ( [ omega ] ) allows for additional symmetry reductions . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is readily seen in the shifted spatial variable @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , since @xmath27 , if @xmath28 is a solution of ( [ gpe ] ) then the function obtained through the reduction @xmath29 , is also a solution ( @xmath30 by analogy with the charge symmetry  @xcite indicates the symmetry related to the inversion of the internal degree of freedom , which is the pseudo - spin in our case ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , due to the property @xmath31 one more symmetry stems from the possibility of flipping spin components in the @xmath32 shifted lattice : @xmath33 is a solution of the stationary gpes .    </S>",
    "<S> bearing in mind the symmetries of the gpes it is natural to use them for classifying the solutions , i.e. to identify solutions which would be the eigenstates of the respective @xmath34 , @xmath35 or @xmath36 operators . </S>",
    "<S> it is important , however , that the pt and cpt symmetries imposed on the solutions , rule out the phase invariance which is an attribute of the gpes , because @xmath37 with a real @xmath38 is not commutative with the @xmath39 operator . </S>",
    "<S> this artificial constraint on the solutions of the gpes can be avoided by generalizing the definition of the symmetric modes . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we define a pt [ cpt ] symmetric solution , @xmath40 [ @xmath41 , as solutions for which there exist a constant phase @xmath38 transforming it into eigenfunctions of the respective symmetry operator , i.e. ensuring @xmath42 [ @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to a possibility of bifurcations of nonlinear modes obeying the above symmetries from the respective linear bloch spinors @xmath44col@xmath45 which solve the spectral problem @xmath46 , where @xmath47 refers to the wave - vector in the reduced brillouin zone ( bz ) , while @xmath48 indicates the number of the branch corresponding to the given @xmath47 with @xmath49 being the lowest one . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetries described above obviously hold also for the eigenfunctions of @xmath50 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we show three typical band - gap spectra @xmath51 . in the absence of the constant </S>",
    "<S> splitting ( @xmath25 ) and at relatively weak so coupling the lower band - edges are reached only at the boundary of the bz ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> increase of the so coupling results in closure of the first finite gap and appearance of the crossing points in the spectrum , as well as in a shift of the band - gap edges to some internal points of the bz ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) , which are symmetric with respect to the center of the bz and will be denoted as @xmath52 . finally , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c we observe `` re - opening '' of the first gap due to nonzero constant component of the zeeman field @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the lowest branches of the spectra in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b and [ fig1]c resemble the well known spectrum of the homogeneous so - bec .     with the periodic potential ( [ omega ] ) for @xmath54 and ( a ) @xmath55 , @xmath25 ( b ) @xmath56 , @xmath25 , ( c ) @xmath56 , @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> horizontal gray lines indicate the band - gap edges . </S>",
    "<S> red and blue arrows indicate the points from which gap solitons bifurcate in the case of attractive and repulsive nonlinearities , respectively . ]    when the gap edge corresponds to the bz boundary @xmath58 ( fig .  [ fig1]a ) due to the pt - symmetry the bloch spinor can be chosen as @xmath59col@xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are real @xmath63periodic functions . </S>",
    "<S> such bloch states give rise to pt - symmetric gap solitons : @xmath64 , whose common property is that each spin component has symmetric distribution of the atomic density . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , introducing @xmath65 of the densities of the spinor components one verifies that @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of attractive interactions such soliton belonging to the semi - infinite band is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a . </S>",
    "<S> notice , that while this situation is seemingly similar to the one observed in the homogeneous medium  @xcite the effective periodic potential induced by the zeeman field is inverted for the different components resulting in an immiscible anti - ferromagnetic phase ( the atoms of each component are located in the minima of the respective periodic potentials ) . </S>",
    "<S> a counterpart of the described solitons can be also obtained in a finite gap in the case of repulsive inter - atomic interactions , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b . </S>",
    "<S> although there exists a general qualitative similarity with the soliton in the semi - infinite gap ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a ) now the domains of the atomic concentration ( i.e. the points where density is maximal ) , especially in the second component , do not coincide with the local minima of the effective potential for the respective component .     for the attractive nonlinearity ( a ) ; pt - symmetric ( b ) and cpt - symmetric ( c ) solitons with @xmath67 originating from the first finite gap for the repulsive nonlinearity , and soliton with @xmath68 from the first finite gap for attractive nonlinearity ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> in all cases @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath25 . the dashed line shows the lattice profile for the @xmath69 component . ]    turning to @xmath35-symmetric solitons , we observe that their characteristic feature is the equal number of atoms @xmath70 in the both components , @xmath71 , since the densities are now related as : @xmath72 . . </S>",
    "<S> using this definition we conclude that @xmath35-symmetric solitons have zero total magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> an example of such a gap soliton emerging from the first finite gap in a repulsive condensate is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]c . </S>",
    "<S> in such modes the maxima of density distributions in the two components are separated by a half of the lattice period and are located in neighboring extrema of the zeeman lattice @xmath9 .    finally , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]d we show a pt - symmetric soliton emerging from the first finite gap in the so - bec with attractive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> now the symmetries of the spinor components are `` inverted '' as compared to the case shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a , i.e. now @xmath73 and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this `` inversion '' is that the soliton bifurcates from the upper gap edge ( see the upper red arrow in fig .  [ fig1]a ) , thus resulting in the change of the sign of the effective mass .    </S>",
    "<S> the total numbers of atoms and magnetizations as functions of the chemical potential are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . for all solitons </S>",

    "<S> this indicates that the envelopes @xmath78 of all bifurcating solitons in the small amplitude limit , @xmath79 , are described by the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation . in the panels b and c one </S>",
    "<S> observes that the branches of pt and cpt symmetric solitons seemingly merge . </S>",
    "<S> this however occurs only on the plane ( @xmath80 ) and do not represent a bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> the both types of the solutions bifurcate from the different linear modes ( obeying the respective symmetries ) . </S>",
    "<S> coincidence of the branches close to the gap edge is explained by the @xmath36-symmetry ensuring the equality of the spatially averaged densities of the two components in the linear bloch spinors , from which the respective solitons bifurcate . </S>",
    "<S> cp and cpt solitons in the first finite gap have also different stability  @xcite . in the case of repulsive interactions pt solitons are stable ( unstable ) at lower ( larger ) amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> cpt solitons are unstable , while in the vicinity of the bifurcation point they can be classified as metastable ones as the instability increment is small enough ( @xmath81 ) within the region of width @xmath82 adjacent to the upper gap edge located at @xmath83 . in the condensate with negative scattering length </S>",
    "<S> the cpt - symmetric solitons are always unstable while in the vicinity of the band - edge , i.e. in the small - amplitude limit ( with the width of the metastable domain @xmath84 ) the pt - symmetric solitons can are metastable .     for pt - symmetric solitons emerging from the semi - infinite gap in the case of attractive nonlinearity ( a ) , for pt and cpt symmetric solitons emerging from the first finite gap in the case of repulsive ( b ) and attractive ( c ) nonlinearity . in ( c ) magnetization </S>",

[ fig1]b and  [ fig1]c ) . in the homogeneous case similar situation gives origin to a stripe - phase  @xcite in repulsive condensate or to a stripe - soliton  @xcite in a condensate with a negative scattering length . in order to construct a pt - symmetric solution we depart from one of the superposition of the linear spinors , </S>",
    "<S> say @xmath90 , where the relation between the bloch states is given by @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> pt - symmetric gap - stripe solitons belonging to the branch bifurcating from @xmath92 are illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> although we have observed ( numerically ) stable time evolutions of the gap - stripe solitons in the case of repulsive interactions which was accompanied by regular oscillations of the amplitude , indicating on a possibility of a breather solution . comparing the gap - stripe solitons with the `` conventional '' gap solitons considered above , we find that while the envelope of stripe - solitons is also described by the nls equation , i.e. @xmath93 close to the gap edge , the total magnetization now displays very different behavior near the bifurcation point : it approaches a nonzero value . </S>",
    "<S> this difference with the cases of the pt - symmetric solitons follows from the structure of the linear bloch spinors , which now do not obey s - symmetry and thus the states @xmath69 and @xmath94 have different populations . in other words </S>",
