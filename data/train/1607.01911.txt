    "recent advances in the techniques of configuring optical potentials  @xcite allow for the fabrication of lattice potentials for ultra - cold atoms in a variety of geometric configurations . combined with the technique of causing dissipation from a particular well through use of an electron beam  @xcite or by optical means  @xcite , and the possibility of pumping a bose - hubbard system from a larger reservoir condensate  @xcite",
    ", we have the elements required for the fabrication of nonlinear damped and pumped optical cavities with varying configurations . in this work",
    "we perform theoretical investigations of two different bose - hubbard models  @xcite with added pumping and loss .",
    "we investigate the population dynamics , the quantum statistics of the system such as squeezing and inseparability , and a pseudo - entropy obtained from a reduced single particle density matrix .",
    "we will show that there is some degree of steady - state quadrature squeezing in both the configurations we examine , that mode inseparability is demonstrated using quadrature measures , and that the population dynamics and quantum statistical fatures depend on both the configuration and the collisional nonlinearity .",
    "an early investigation by drummond and walls analysed a quantum optical system consisting of a kerr medium inside a fabry - perot cavity , which is mathematically the equivalent of a pumped and damped single well bose - hubbard model  @xcite , with the main difference being that kerr nonlinearities tend to be higher with atomic systems .",
    "more recently , pizorn has analysed bose - hubbard models with pumping and dissipation  @xcite , using density matrix techniques , which are useful for moderate numbers of atoms and wells .",
    "have analysed a two dimensional bose - hubbard model in terms of steady - state phases and instabilities , with an emphasis on coupled photonic microcavities  @xcite .",
    "more recently , cui _ et al .",
    "_ have investigated driven and dissipative bose - hubbard models , obtaining mean - field analytical results for a two - well system  @xcite . in this work",
    "we analyse both the dynamics and steady - state properties of our systems , going beyond the mean - field approximation with the truncated wigner representation  @xcite , which does not impose a computational limitation on the number of atoms .",
    "the main advantages of the truncated wigner representation are that the computational complexity scales linearly with the number of wells , and it does not suffer from the catastrophic instabilities of the positive - p representation  @xcite .",
    "in this investigation we use the truncated wigner representation  @xcite , which we fully expect to be accurate for our systems in the presence of pumping and dissipation .",
    "although this method will not capture any revivals in population oscillations in an isolated bose - hubbard dimer  @xcite , nor will it calculate two - time correlation functions accurately  @xcite , we do not expect the first in a damped system , and we are not interested in the second here .",
    "the truncated wigner representation goes beyond the pairing mean - field theory  @xcite and the bogoliubov back reaction method  @xcite previously used in theoretical analyses in that it imposes no factorisation assumptions on correlations , irrespective of their order .",
    "beginning with the two - well unitary bose - hubbard hamiltonian , this is written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the bosonic annihilation operator for the @xmath2th well , @xmath3 represents the collisional nonlinearity and @xmath4 is the tunneling strength .",
    "we will always consider that the pumping is into well @xmath5 , which can be represented by the hamiltonian @xmath6 which is commonly used for the investigation of optical cavities .",
    "the basic assumption here is that the first well receives atoms from a coherent condensate which is much larger than any of the modes in the wells we are investigating , so that it will not become noticeably depleted over the time scales of interest .",
    "the damping term for well @xmath2 acts on the system density matrix as the lindblad superoperator @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coupling between the damped well and the atomic bath , which we assume to be unpopulated .",
    "physically , such a damping process can be realised using an electron beam  @xcite .",
    "if the lost atoms fall under gravity , we are justified in using the markov and born approximations  @xcite .    following the usual procedures  @xcite",
    ", we may map the problem onto a generalised fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the wigner distribution of the system . since this generalised fpe contains third - order derivatives ,",
    "we truncate at second order .",
    "although it is possible to map the third - order derivatives onto stochastic difference equations , these are highly unstable  @xcite .",
    "having discarded these derivatives , we may map the resulting fpe onto it stochastic equations  @xcite for the wigner variables . these equations for a two - well chain with pumping at well @xmath5 and loss at well @xmath9 are @xmath10 with those with loss at the pumped well resulting from moving the terms proportional to @xmath8 . in the above equation",
    ", @xmath11 represents the rate at which atoms enter well @xmath5 from the pumping mode , @xmath8 is the loss rate from the second well , and @xmath12 is a complex gaussian noise with the moments @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where the upper line represents a classical averaging process .",
    "the variables @xmath15 correspond to the operators @xmath1 in the sense that averages of products of the wigner variables over many stochastic trajectories become equivalent to symmetrically ordered operator expectation values , for example @xmath16 .",
    "the initial states in all wells will be vacuum , sampled as in olsen and bradley  @xcite for coherent states with vacuum excitation .",
    "we note here that we will use @xmath17 and @xmath18 in all our numerical investigations , while varying the value of @xmath3 .",
    "we have averaged over at least @xmath19 stochastic trajectories for all the graphical results presented here , and the sampling error is typically less than the plotted line widths .",
    "there are several quantities worthy of investigation here , including the populations in each well , @xmath20 , the coherences between the wells , the currents into each well , the quadrature variances , a reduced single - particle pseudo - entropy , and measures of separability and entanglement .",
    "we firstly define the real coherence function between wells @xmath5 and @xmath9 , @xmath21 note that we define this as a real function so that it may be plotted , which is not as simple for the actual complex coherence , and take the square root so that it will be of the same magnitude as the currents .",
    "if our atomic cavities behave as a collection of superfluid states analogous to the electromagnetic field in a pumped optical cavity without internal nonlinearity , we expect that these would obtain their coherent state values in the steady state , for example , @xmath22 the inclusion of finite @xmath3 , with the attendant phase - diffusion  @xcite and shearing of the wigner function  @xcite , should act to decrease these values .",
    "the current from well @xmath5 into well @xmath9 is defined as @xmath23    defining the atomic quadratures as @xmath24 so that @xmath25 , squeezing exists whenever a quadrature variance is found to be less than @xmath5 , for any angle . as is well known ,",
    "one of the effects of a @xmath26 nonlinearity is to cause any squeezing to be found at a non - zero quadrature angle  @xcite .",
    "having defined our quadratures , we may now define the correlations we will investigate to detect entanglement between modes .",
    "the first of these , known as the duan - simon inequality  @xcite , states that , for any two separable states , @xmath27 with any violation of this inequality demonstrating the inseparability of modes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "a further set of inequalities , based on the cauchy - schwarz inequality , have been developed by hillery and zubairy  @xcite .",
    "they showed that , considering two separable modes denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath28 , @xmath30 with the equality holding for coherent states .",
    "the violation of this inequality is thus an indication of the inseparability of , and entanglement between , the two modes . as shown by olsen  @xcite ,",
    "this is useful for systems where number conservation holds , and in which case the duan - simon criterion may not detect inseparability .",
    "although this is not the case here , it is still of interest to compare the predictions with the quadrature inequalities defined above . using the hillery - zubairy result",
    ", we now define the correlation function @xmath31 for which a positive value reveals entanglement between modes @xmath5 and @xmath9 . in the wigner representation , this is found as @xmath32    the last quantity which we investigate is a pseudo - entropy , derived from the single particle reduced density matrix  @xcite , defined for two wells as @xmath33 the pseudo - entropy is then defined in the standard von neumann manner as @xmath34 analytical values can be calculated in some limiting cases , such as a system of fock or coherent states .",
    "these limiting cases are useful for the calculation of maximum values to which the system should relax if all coherences disappear . as a final note ,",
    "we mention that all the quantities needed for the correlations above can in principle be measured , either by density ( number ) measurements or via atomic homodyning  @xcite .",
    "for a two - well dimer , there are two different configurations that we investigate .",
    "the first has pumping at well @xmath5 with loss at well @xmath9 , while the second has both pumping and loss at well @xmath5 .",
    "as we show below , they exhibit qualitatively different behaviours . the first configuration is described by eq .",
    "[ eq : bhp1g2 ] .",
    "if we set @xmath35 , we can find the classical steady - state solutions , @xmath36 showing that the steady - state populations of the two wells are equal for our parameters , with the coherent excitation of the first well being real while that of the second well is in the @xmath37 quadrature .",
    "values and loss at well @xmath9 .",
    "the classical non - interacting value is shown by the dashed line .",
    "@xmath38 is a dimensionless time and all quantities plotted in this and subsequent plots are dimensionless . ]",
    "values and loss at well @xmath9 .",
    "the classical non - interacting value is shown by the dashed line . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cav2g2n1 ] we show the stochastically calculated populations in the first well , for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the classical non - interacting steady - state solution is shown as a dashed line .",
    "we see that , while the smaller value of @xmath3 causes the steady - state value to increase , the larger value causes it to decrease .",
    "the values for the second well are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cav2g2n2 ] , where we see the same trend , so that the total number of atoms decreases for the greater value of the nonlinearity .",
    "this is to be expected since the nonlinearity causes an imaginary component of the field analogous to that caused by detuning of an optical cavity , where the circulating power in an optical system decreases by a factor of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the detuning .",
    "the increase for the smaller @xmath3 value is counterintuitive and can not be explained by the same reasoning .     into well @xmath9 and the coherence function , @xmath43 , for the two different values of @xmath3 . ]    the currents into the second well and the coherence functions @xmath43 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cav2g2isig ] .",
    "we see that increasing the collisional nonlinearity decreases both the current and the coherences . a decrease in current",
    "can be explained by the fact that , with the higher nonlinearity , we are approaching the macroscopic self - trapping ( mst ) regime  @xcite , where tunnelling is suppressed .",
    "the lower values of the coherences are explained almost entirely by the reduced populations , with phase diffusion playing a very limited role .",
    "their values are almost indistinguishable from what is expected for two coherent states .    when we investigate the quantum statistics of the modes , we find steady - state quadrature squeezing and smallish violations of the duan - simon inequality of eq .",
    "[ eq : ds ] .",
    "we present these values and the quadrature angles of the greatest violation in the table below .",
    "we found that @xmath44 only in the transient regimes , with no steady - state violations of the hillery - zubairy inequality .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we see that the quadrature squeezing results are similar to those of the first configuration , but that there is a significant violation of the duan - simon inequality for the higher nonlinearity .",
    "this happens because the mode covariances are larger for these parmaters .",
    "the steady - state pseudo - entropy was found as @xmath45 for @xmath39 , and @xmath46 for @xmath47.the actual steady - state reduced density matrices are found as @xmath48 and @xmath49 with zero coherences and unchanged populations , the values of the pseudo - entropy would be @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "we see that , for both configurations , the intracavity systems are far from their closed system equilibrium values .",
    "the increased violation of the duan - simon inequality for the higher non - linearity , and over the first system that we considered , suggest that this system may be the better one for any experimental measurement of bipartite mode entanglement .",
    "in conclusion , we have analysed the quantum dynamics of a pumped and damped bose - hubbard dimer in two different configurations . depending on which well is damped",
    ", the population dynamics will be very different .",
    "the inclusion of a finite collisional term in the equations of motion changes the average solutions from their non - interacting values .",
    "in particular , in the second configuration we analysed , with pumping and damping at the same well , collisions cause a finite steady - state population in the first well by contrast to the zero occupation predicted without collisional interaction .    going beyond the populations , we have found squeezing in the steady - state atomic quadratures , with the amount of squeezing increasing as the collisional nonlinearity is increased .",
    "the only configuration for which we found a reasonable entanglement signal between the two wells was for the higher nonlinearity and pumping and damping at different wells .",
    "our calculations of a reduced single - particle pseudo - entropy show that the systems remain far from the equilibrium state of two isolated wells , with the interwell coherences not dropping markedly below those expected for coherent states . given recent experimental advances ,",
    "an experimental realisation of these systems should be possible . as a final remark",
    ", we note that the truncated wigner method that we have used easily allows for extension to a greater number of wells .",
