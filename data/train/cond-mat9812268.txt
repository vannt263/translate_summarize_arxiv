    "the problem of nonlinear flow , as modeled by a nonlinear schrodinger equation in the presence of a scattering potential , relates to a variety of physical situations .",
    "one example is a weakly interacting bose gas with impurities , while another is a josephson array in a regime appropriate to a ginzburg - landau formulation . here",
    ", the array consists of short , normal - metal ( n ) regions in the presence of a hartree electron - electron interaction , and embedded within a superconducting wire near its critical temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "the latter example falls within the rapidly developing field of study of the interplay of the proximity effect and charging effects due to interactions in disordered , inhomogeneous superconducting systems @xcite .",
    "further examples arise within nonlinear optics @xcite and in the study of gravity waves on deep water @xcite .",
    "we will concern ourselves with the existence of time-_independent _ solutions of the flow equations in the presence of a supercurrent .",
    "in general the value of the supercurrent is limited by a maximum value , the critical current , above which the flow becomes unsteady and a time - dependent solution must be sought .",
    "recently hakim @xcite considered the superfluid flow past a single , repulsive scatterer in one dimension and deduced the dependence of the critical current on the scattering strength .",
    "we extend this model to the geometry of a regular array of scatterers .",
    "we find a rich dependence of the critical current on the scatterer separation and strength , with markedly different behaviour in the cases of repulsive and attractive scatterers .",
    "although we will focus here on the steady - state flow , the physics of unsteady flows in related problems has also received attention .",
    "for instance , unsteady flow past a single scatterer in one dimension @xcite represents a transition state towards the emission of solitons and hence phase - slip nucleation .",
    "it has also been pointed out @xcite that steady - state flow may not be stable to mechanisms of quantum tunnelling , leading to phase - slip nucleation and non - zero dissipation even below the ( quasiclassical ) critical current .",
    "higher dimensional analogues of the problem are also of theoretical and experimental importance , although less tractable analytically : recent work has simulated numerically the flow of a superfluid past an obstacle @xcite or through a constriction @xcite in two dimensions , for which vortices are nucleated above the critical supercurrent .",
    "these investigations relate directly to experimental work @xcite on superfluid @xmath4he .",
    "as mentioned above , an important application of this model is in the description of supercurrent flow in a mesoscopic sns device near the critical temperature of the s region .",
    "the ginzburg - landau equations for the order parameter near the critical temperature of such a device are equivalent to the flow equations for a superfluid in the hartree approximation .",
    "furthermore , a short n region may be modelled as a point - like scatterer whose strength diverges as @xmath0 is approached and the ginzburg - landau correlation length diverges .",
    "we will exploit this equivalence to translate our results directly into experimental predictions for the temperature dependence of the critical current of a josephson array , consisting of short n regions embedded in a superconducting wire near @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence of the critical current on the temperature is a property that has already been examined in a number of related systems .",
    "for example , it is an established result @xcite that a superconducting wire ( with no n regions ) has a critical current that behaves as @xmath5 as @xmath0 is approached , while the introduction of a single , short n region leads to a critical current that depends quadratically as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in addition it has been possible to fabricate and measure experimentally a superconducting ` microladder ' @xcite , consisting of a pair of s wires with connecting side - branches : in this geometry , a well - defined correction to the @xmath5 dependance of the critical current of the superconducting wire has been observed and explained theoretically .",
    "courtois et al .",
    "@xcite have also measured the critical current for another geometry ( somewhat complementary to that considered by us ) of an array of short s regions near @xmath0 within a n metal , again with a reasonable fit to the theory @xcite .",
    "the case of _ two _ short n regions , comprising a double - barrier structure , has also been examined theoretically , by zapata and sols @xcite .",
    "they interpret such a system as representing a nonlinear analogue of resonant tunnelling : such a scattering structure is well known in a _ linear _ system to lead to phenonema such as the sensitivity of the transmission coefficient to the scatterer separation , peaking near well - defined resonances due to multiple inner reflection .",
    "the introduction of nonlinearity leads immediately to markedly different behaviour , the added complexity precluding even any kind of crossover regime in terms of a nonlinearity parameter .",
    "the critical current of the double - barrier structure depends as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is some temperature below @xmath0 .    for the geometry of an array of short n regions embedded within a superconducting wire",
    ", we find a _ linear _ dependence of the critical current as @xmath9 , in contrast to the cases described above .",
    "furthermore , the coefficient @xmath2 depends sensitively on the sizes of the s and n regions and the strength and sign of the electron interaction .",
    "the calculation of the chemical potential , while trivial in the geometry of a finite number of scatterers , becomes more complex in the array geometry , and follows by the incorporation of a normalization condition to fix the total boson number .",
    "this procedure leads to the increased complexity of the flow solutions .",
    "we find a further feature in the temperature dependence of the critical current in the case of an attractive interaction : the critical current vanishes linearly at some temperature @xmath3 less than @xmath0 , as well as at @xmath0 itself . we will rule out a simple explanation for the zero value of the critical current at this temperature , @xmath3 , in terms of order - parameter fluctuations at vanishingly low frequencies .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we describe the model and flow equations for a superfluid in the presence of scatterers . in section",
    "[ sec : single ] we review briefly the solution of these equations for a single scatterer in the time - independent regime . in section [ sec :",

    ". section [ sec : sound ] includes a discussion on order - parameter fluctuations at the special separation value of @xmath10 , at which the critical current vanishes , and section [ sec : discuss ] concludes with a summary .",

    "we employ the hartree approximation @xcite to write the ground state wavefunction in the symmetrised form , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the system size .",
    "this leads to the following nonlinear schrodinger equation for @xmath19 : @xmath20 where we have rescaled length according to units of the healing length , @xmath21 , and energy ( and the @xmath11 ) according to units of the hartree energy , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the average particle density .",
    "the speed of sound in the condensate in the absence of the scatterers , ie .",
    "@xmath24 , is equal to unity with this choice of units .",
    "in addition , we must enforce the condition of fixed total boson number , which is achieved by normalizing the wavefunction according to @xmath25    we now introduce the number - phase representation ( the madelung transformation @xcite ) : @xmath26 inserting eqn .",

    "having described the integration of the flow equations , we present here the results for the critical current of the array .",
    "further details of the working towards these results will be described in the following section .",

    "we see that the correct behaviour is reproduced in the limit of @xmath72 .",
    "we also see that in the attractive case , the critical current vanishes altogether at one special value of @xmath55",

    "in general , we find at such small separations the chemical potential approaches a large positive ( negative ) value in the repulsive ( attractive ) case , reflecting the large ` potential energy ' of the scatterers .",
    "in addition , for small @xmath77 , the density @xmath62 remains close to 1 for all values of @xmath91 .",
    "in contrast , for large @xmath77 , the value of @xmath62 approaches 2 at the origin and 0 at the scatterers for the repulsive case , and 0 at the origin and @xmath92 at the scatterers in the attractive case .",
    "to derive the critical current , it is necessary to identify the somewhat subtle interplay of the various parameters of the problem , which requires a separate and quite different discussion for each of the four cases .",

    "our approach in each case will be to indicate the existence of a local ( rather than global ) maximum in the supercurrent .",
    "strictly speaking , we still need to justify these choices of a local maxima as the relevant values for the critical current .",
    "to do so , we appeal to the numerical results of section [ sec : results ] which establish the smooth interpolation from the limit of small separation to large separation and hence to the single scatterer result for the critical current , which certainly does represent a global maximum .      in the repulsive case ,",
