    "@xcite    in the case of weakly coupled layers we expect that the bias current generates charge accumulation on the layers between a resistive and superconducting junction . as the current through a resistive junction is carried mostly by quasi - particles , while the current through a barrrier in the superconducting state is carried by cooper - pairs , we expect two types of non - equilibrium effects : 1",

    "non - equilibrium effects in layered superconductors have been discussed in a number of papers in various contexts with different methods and approximations .",
    "@xcite in a recent theoretical paper @xcite we have investigated in particular the consequences of non - equilibrium effects on experiments with stationary currents .",
    "we found that in this case only the charge - imbalance is important and leads to a change in the voltage , while the shift of the chemical potential has no influence on the measured voltage .",
    "the latter determines e.g. the dispersion of longitudinal josephson plasma waves @xcite and can be observed in some optical properties .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we report on new experiments which show clear evidence of non - equilibrium effects for stationary currents and which can be explained by charge - imbalance on the superconducting layers . in the first type of experiments",
    "shapiro steps produced by high - frequency irradiation are measured in mesa structures of bscco with gold contacts . here a shift @xmath6 of the step - voltage @xmath7 from its canonical value @xmath8 is observed , which can be traced back to a change of the contact resistance due to charge - imbalance on the first superconducting layer . in another type of experiments current - voltage curves",
    "are measured for two mesas structured close to each other on the same base crystal . here",
    "an influence of the current through one mesa on the voltage drop on the other mesa has been measured which can be explained by charge - imbalance on the first common superconducting layer of the base crystal .",
    "both experiments allow to measure the charge - imbalance relaxation rate .",
    "we start with a brief summary of the theory @xcite which will be used in the following .",
    "then the sample preparation and the different experiments are described and discussed . from the experiments the charge - imbalance relaxation time will be determined .",
    "let us consider a stack of superconducting layers @xmath9 with a normal electrode @xmath10 on top .",
    "the basic quantity which determines the josephson effect of a junction between layer @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the gauge invariant phase difference @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the phase of the order parameter on layer @xmath11 and @xmath15 is the vector potential in the barrier . for the time derivative of @xmath16 one",
    "obtains the general josephson relation : @xmath17 here @xmath18 @xmath19 are the voltage and the gauge invariant scalar potential , @xmath20 is the electrical scalar potential . the quantity @xmath21 can be considered as shift of the chemical potential of the superconducting condensate ( in this paper the charge of the electron is written as @xmath22 ) .    the total charge fluctuation @xmath23 on layer @xmath11 consists of charge fluctuations of the condensate and of charge fluctuations of quasi - particles .",
    "it is convenient to express the latter also by a kind of potential @xmath24 writing @xmath25 with help of the maxwell equation ( @xmath26 is the distance between the layers , @xmath27 the dielectric constant of the junction ) @xmath28 the generalized josephson relation now reads : @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "it shows that the josephson oscillation frequency is determined not only by the voltage in the same junction but also by the voltages in neighboring junctions .",
    "furthermore it is influenced by the quasi - particle potential @xmath31 on the layers .",
    "if we neglect the latter we obtain for @xmath32 the same result as in ref .  .",
    "these equations for the voltage between the layers have to be supplemented by an equation for the current density : in the stationary state ( no displacement current ) it can be written as @xcite @xmath33 here the quasi - particle current between layers @xmath11 and @xmath12 is driven not only by the voltage @xmath34 between the layers but also by additonal terms which result from the charge fluctuation on the two layers . in the stationary state",
    "the dc - density @xmath35 is the same for all barriers and is equal to the bias current density @xmath36 .",
    "if the josephson junction is in the resistive state we may neglect the dc - component of the supercurrent density in ( [ current2 ] ) for junctions with a large mccumber parameter @xmath37 .",
    "then we obtain : @xmath38    for the junction between the normal electrode ( @xmath10 ) and the first superconducting layer ( @xmath39 we may neglect charge fluctuations on the former and obtain for the current : @xmath40    finally we need an equation of motion for the quasi - particle charge . here",
    "we consider a relaxation process between quasi - particle charge and condensate charge within the layer .",
    "@xcite in the stationary case the quasi - particle charge is proportional to the charge - imbalance relaxation time @xmath41 and the difference between supercurrents flowing in and out the layer , or equivalently , by the difference in quasi - particle currents : @xcite @xmath42 in the limit of small non - equilibrium effects and for @xmath43 we may use the approximation @xmath44 for a resistive junction and @xmath45 for a junction in the superconducting state .",
    "for example , if a current @xmath36 is flowing from a junction in the resistive state into a junction in the superconducting state , the charge - imbalance potential generated on the superconducting layer between the two junctions is @xmath46 .",
    "for measuring the intrinsic josephson effect in bscco we used a mesa geometry .",
    "our base materials were bscco single crystals which were grown by standard melting techniques .",
    "after glueing these crystals on saphire substrates , a 100 nm thin gold layer was thermally evaporated .",
    "the mesa was patterned by electron beam lithography and etching by a neutral ar atomic beam . as etching rates for gold and bscco",
    "are known quite exactly , the number of josephson junctions inside the mesa could be adjusted to be between 5 and 10 . to avoid shortcuts between au leads and the superconducting base crystal an insulating sio layer was evaporated .",
    "this material was removed from the top of the mesa by liftoff . for contact",
    "leads a second au layer was evaporated .",
    "the shape of these leads was defined by standard photolithography and etched by ar atoms . for samples used in fir experiments",
    "these au leads were formed in the shape of bow - tie antennas .",
    "@xcite    a second type of experiments is concerned with induced charge imbalance . here",
    "additional preparation steps were necessary .",
    "these samples consist of two small mesas on top of one bigger mesa ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dmesa ] ) .    ]    to realize this geometry the top layers of a larger mesa ( structured as described above ) had to be cut in two smaller ones .",
    "the whole sample was protected by electron - beam resist except a thin line on top of the big mesa . by etching this sample the larger mesa",
    "could be divided in two smaller mesas . to keep a part of the base below the two smaller ones the etching process had to be controlled precisely .",
    "the resistance of the gold lead was recorded during etching showing the time when gold was removed and separation of the big mesa began . with this technique",
    "we were able to structure samples with @xmath47 and @xmath48 mesas each including about 10 intrinsic josephson junctions on top of one larger one ( @xmath49 , 6 junctions ) .",
    "the gap between the two top mesas was 1@xmath50 m .",

[ cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     iv - characteristics of our samples were recorded by applying dc currents and recording voltages across mesas by digital voltmeters .",
    "if not mentioned otherwise all measurements were performed at a temperature of 4.2 k.    as radiation source for experiments presented in section 4.1 we used a far - infrared laser which was optically pumped by a co@xmath2 laser . to minimize power losses we used a polyethylene lens producing a parallel beam .",
    "inside the optical cryostat the samples were fixed in the center of a silicon hyperhemispherical lens to focus the radiation onto the mesa .",
    "@xcite for some samples we used a very sensitive setup to detect shapiro steps and to determine voltage of these resonances very precisely . for this purpose the laser beam was modulated by an optical chopper with a fixed frequency . with the chopper frequency as external reference",
    ", the voltage across the junction was connected to the input of a lock - in amplifier ( li ) . as the li analyzes voltage changes",
    "occurring with the chopper frequency the output signal @xmath51 exhibits a point - symmetric structure .",
    "thus the li output signal represents the voltage difference between iv- characteristics with and without laser radiation .",
    "the voltage of the shapiro step can easily be identified as the symmetry point of this signal .",
    "our experiments with high frequency electromagnetic radiation have been carried out with three samples # 32 ( @xmath52 ) , # 39 ( @xmath53 ) and # 20 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we first discuss results for sample # 32 which consists of eight intrinsic josephson junctions as can be seen in the iv - characteristics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:32iv ] .     iv characteristic of sample # 32 . ]    the increasing values of critical currents may be explained by the inhomogeneous etching process during fabrication producing layers with increasing areas from top to bottom of the mesa .",
    "then it is natural to assume that the values of critical currents increase with the position of the junctions inside the mesa . in particular",
    ", the first resistive branch of the iv - characteristics should be assigned to the uppermost josephson junction of the mesa .",
    "the critical current on branch number 0 is strongly suppressed and its iv - curve is linear , while the other branches show the typical non - linear iv - dependence characteristic for a tunneling junction between two superconducting layers with d - wave order parameter .",
    "the special behaviour of branch 0 might be explained by the assumption that the first superconducting layer is in proximity contact with the normal gold electrode .",
    "this sample was irradiated with four external frequencies between 584 ghz and 762 ghz . on the iv characteristic",
    "we could detect first order shapiro steps on the first resistive branch at an absolute voltage @xmath54 and current @xmath55 . to compare the step - voltage with @xmath8 as predicted by the second josephson relation the contact voltage @xmath56 between au leads and mesa in the superconducting state without radiation had to be measured .",
    "the value @xmath57 can then be compared with @xmath8 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:32vf ] , @xmath58 evaluated for this sample is strictly lower than @xmath8 for all four frequencies .",
    "the relative shift is approximately @xmath59 .",
    "this downshift can be explained if we assume that the josephson junction in the resistive state which is locked to the external radiation with frequency @xmath60 is close to the normal electrode , i.e. between the first and second superconducting layer . for this junction",
    "we have @xmath61 while for the other junctions , which are in the superconducting state , we use @xmath62 for @xmath63 . adding up these equations together with the current relation for the contact with the normal electrode ( [ contact ] ) we obtain for the total voltage : @xmath64 here we have assumed that @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath67 drops out . finally , the charge - imbalance potential @xmath68 vanishes on the first layer since the on- and off - flowing quasiparticle currents are equal , @xmath69 .",

    "we have to compare this result with the voltage measured in the absence of high - frequency irradiation , when all junctions are in the superconducting state .",
    "then ( [ super ] ) holds for @xmath70 . adding up now equations ( [ super ] ) and ( [ contact ] ) we obtain for the total voltage ( contact voltage in the superconducting state ) : @xmath71 the quasi - particle potential on the first superconducting layer",
    "is now given by @xmath72 while @xmath65 for @xmath73 .",
    "subtracting the measured contact voltage from the voltage of the shapiro step we obtain for the step - voltage : @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "the shift is proportional to the life - time of charge - imbalance .",
    "iv characteristic of sample # 39 . ]",
    "sample # 39 consists of 20 intrinsic josephson junctions . for this sample",
    "the distribution of critical currents is more homogeneous ( fig .",
    "[ fig:39iv ] ) than for # 32 making it impossible to determine the position of the junction generating the first resistive branch inside the mesa . by using the sensitive measurement technique with a pulsed laser beam we were able to detect shapiro steps on the first resistive branch at three fir frequencies between 1.40 thz and 1.63 thz .",
    "the voltage differences @xmath58 of these resonances were calculated as described above .",
    "in contrast to # 32 for this sample no deviations from @xmath8 were measured . in view of the theory presented above this",
    "means , that the resistive junction which is locked to external radiation is not close to the normal electrode or the charge - imbalance time is rather short for this sample .",
    "finally we want to focus on sample # 20 consisting of 11 intrinsic josephson junctions .",
    "the iv - curves of this sample show a very homogeneous distribution of critical currents making it impossible to assign any branch to a junction at a certain position inside the mesa .",
    "however , for different current cycles ( increase @xmath76 to its maximum value than decrease it zero ) two different first branches marked 1a and 1b in fig .",
    "[ fig:20iv ] are measured .",
    "this means that two different junctions in the stack become resistive first .",
    "we were able to detect shapiro steps at five frequencies between 1.27 thz and 1.82 thz on both branches 1a and 1b . analyzing the voltage differences @xmath58 we got different values for 1a and 1b ( fig .",
    "[ fig:20vf ] ) . on branch 1a",
    "the voltages of shapiro steps were detected at regular values of @xmath8 whereas voltages of 1b were shifted to values @xmath77 below @xmath8 .",
    "this behaviour can be explained by assuming that in case 1b the junction close to the normal electrode becomes resistive while in case 1a a junction inside the stack becomes resistive .",
    "this assumption is also in agreement with the observation that the voltage of the second branch at the critical current is approximately given by the sum of the voltages of 1a and 1b and the voltage differences for the higher branches are rather homogenous and are close to the value for branch 1a .",

    "we want to mention that we could also measure shapiro steps on higher resistive branches . due to slightly varying parameters of different resistive josephson junctions analysis of @xmath78",
    "is much more complicated and was not accurate enough to deduce deviations from the second josephson relation .",
    "finally we want to point out that a shift in the shapiro step voltage is only possible , if the resistive junction is close to the normal electrode . in recent measurements of shapiro steps in step - edge junctions",
    "@xcite this is different .",
    "here the resistive josephson junction is inside a stack of superconducting layers and hence no shift is observed .",
    "also no shift of shapiro steps appears in true 4-point measurements and for steps crossing the zero - current line at the point of zero current .",
    "@xcite      the geometry of samples used for injection experiments in double - mesa structures is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmesa ] . as results obtained for the different samples are rather similar",
    ", we will discuss only results for sample # sr102_3 . here",
    "two small mesas m1 of lateral size @xmath47 and m2 of size @xmath79m@xmath80 were structured on a base mesa b of size @xmath81 .",
    "the currents @xmath82 through the mesas m1 and m2 and the base mesa b and the corresponding voltages @xmath83 can be measured separately .",
    "the brush - like structure of the iv - curves which is similar for the two mesas shows two sets of branches with different critical currents .",
    "these belong to 10 josephson junctions in m1 and m2 and 6 junctions in the base mesa .",
    "voltages of m1 and m2 during variation of @xmath76 while @xmath84 . ]",
    "to explain the operation of the device we want to start with the case of no current flowing through m2 ( @xmath84 ) . measuring @xmath85 and @xmath86 during variation of @xmath76 we obtained the curves shown in fig .  [ fig:1024point ] .",
    "@xmath87 shows the full set of iv - curves of m1 and b , while in @xmath88 only the resistive junctions of the base mesa b appear . here",
    "@xmath88 is in fact a 4-point measurement of the iv - characteristic of the base mesa .",
    "note that as long as the junctions in b are completely superconducting , the voltage @xmath86 is exactly zero and independent of @xmath76 . if a small current @xmath89 is applied to m2",
    ", then @xmath90 shows the contact resistance between the gold electrode and the mesa .",
    "again the voltage @xmath86 does not depend on @xmath76 .",
    "now a larger bias current is applied to m2 , such that some junctions of m2 are in the resistive state . keeping @xmath89 fixed we varied the current @xmath76 . during the cycling of @xmath76 junctions in m1",
    "are switched on and off into the resistive state . from time to time also junctions in the other mesa m2 are switched on and off leading to discrete jumps in the voltage @xmath86 , but otherwise @xmath86 is still constant ( horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig:102dv ] ) .    in some cases",
    ", however , the voltage on m2 jumps to an additional branch @xmath88 , which splits off from the constant voltage branch and depends weakly on @xmath76 . the jump into this branch , which is marked @xmath91 in fig .",
    "[ fig:102dv ] , is always triggered by a switch into one of the higher order branches of m1 .",
    "let us note that this happens only if @xmath76 and @xmath89 are in opposite direction .",
    "in later cycles the branch @xmath88 can also traced out by increasing the current @xmath76 from zero . in general , several sets of voltage curves with split branches @xmath92 occur .",
    "the voltages of the horizontal branches correspond to different numbers of junctions of m2 beeing in the resistive state at the fixed current @xmath89 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:102dv ] only the branch corresponding to two resistive junctions is shown .",
    "voltages of m1 and m2 during variation of @xmath76 while two junctions of m2 are in the resistive state . ]",
    "charge - imbalance generated on the first layer of the base mesa by the currents through mesas m1 and m2 . ]    the maximum voltage difference @xmath91 is much smaller than the voltage between different resistive branches in m2 at the bias current @xmath89 .",
    "it is also much smaller than the voltage of resistive junctions in the base mesa .",
    "therefore the appearence of @xmath92 must have a different origin and can be explained as follows : if the junctions between the lowest layers in both mesas m1 and m2 and the first common superconducting layer in b are resistive , then a nonequilibrium potential @xmath93 is generated on the first superconducting layer of the base mesa .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ doublemesa ] : in fig .",
    "[ doublemesa]a only the current @xmath89 contributes to the charge - imbalance potential , while in fig .",
    "[ doublemesa]b both currents contribute .",
    "the generated charge - imbalance potential can be measured directly as additional voltage on m2 : @xmath94 @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the area of the base mesa .",
    "in deriving ( [ dmpot ] ) we assumed that the charge - imbalance relaxation time is large compared to the diffusion time of charge - imbalance along the layer .",
    "finally we want to explain the asymmetry of @xmath88 with respect to the polarity of both currents .",
    "the total current @xmath97 through b is either @xmath98 if the polarity is the same , or @xmath99 if the polarity is opposite . in the first case the total current through b is higher .",
    "this makes it possible that one junction inside b gets resistive before the critical current of the small mesas is exceeded .",
    "this destroys the precondition of a completely superconducting mesa b. when the polarity is opposite the current through b is always smaller than @xmath76 and junctions in m1 will get resistive before any junction in b.      both types of experiments can be used to measure the charge - imbalance relaxation time . from the shift of the shapiro step we obtain @xmath100 where @xmath96 is the area of the mesa . from the injection experiment in the double - mesa structure a similar expression",
    "is obtained .",
    "this equation contains the unknown density of states @xmath101 of the two - dimensional electron gas at the fermi surface .",
    "for a rough estimate we may use the density of states @xmath102 of free conduction electrons with mass @xmath103 , then @xmath104c@xmath80j@xmath105m@xmath106 .",
    "alternatively , by using @xmath107 we can express @xmath108 by the parameter @xmath109 , the dielectric constant @xmath27 of the barrier and the distance @xmath26 between superconducting layers . in ref .",
    "the values @xmath110 , @xmath111 have been estimated from reflectivity experiments ( for another material ) . here",
    "it is found that the value of @xmath112 is rather close to the value of @xmath108 calculated for free conduction electrons , which therefore will be used in the following .    with the data of sample # 32 : @xmath113m@xmath80 , @xmath114a , @xmath115v we find @xmath116 ps . an estimate for the shifts on branch 1b of sample # 20 with 1.63 thz gives values of @xmath117 450 ps .",
    "in a similar way we can also determine @xmath41 from the injection experiments in double - mesa structures .",
    "using @xmath118a , @xmath119a , @xmath120mv , @xmath121m@xmath80 we find @xmath122 330 ps , which is similar to the values obtained from the shifts of shapiro steps .",
    "the charge - imbalance relaxation time @xmath41 describes the recombination of quasi - particles into cooper pairs .",
    "it should be distinguished from the characteristic time for the thermalisation of hot quasi - particles , which is much shorter .",
    "@xcite note that in the present case @xmath41 is much longer than the period of a josephson oscillation on a shapiro step . for the charge - imbalance relaxation",
    "normally inelastic phonon scattering processes are responsible .",
    "it should be noted that in the case of d - wave pairing with an anisotropic gap also elastic impurity scattering contributes .",
    "in this paper we have discussed new experiments showing evidence of non - equilibrium effects in intrinsic josephson contacts in layered superconductors , which are due to charge - imbalance produced by a stationary bias current . in particular , we have investigated the voltage - position of shapiro steps in the presence of high - frequency irradiation .",
    "in some cases we observed a down - shift of 3% from the canonical value of @xmath8 .",
    "this shift , which is not a violation of the basic josephson relation , can be explained by charge imbalance on the first superconducting layer if the josephson contact is next to the normal electrode .    in another type of experiment",
    "we studied the mutual influence of currents through two mesas on a common base mesa on the measured voltages .",
    "the reults can be explained by charge - imbalance on the first common superconducting layer of the base mesa .",
    "this experiments has some similarity with the classical experiment by clarke , @xcite where charge imbalance is produced in a superconductor by a strong quasi - particle current which is then detected as voltage difference between a normal contact and a josephson contact .",
