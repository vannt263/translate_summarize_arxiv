    "hadronization of partons is one of the unsolved problems in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "hadronization is a non - perturbative process and deeply connected to confinement which by itself is still not understood on a fundamental level .",
    "fortunately , techniques have been invented that help to deal with hadronization phenomena in elementary particle collisions in which hadrons are produced .",
    "they are based on universal parameterizations of the unknown non - perturbative quantities .",
    "a famous example are fragmentation functions @xmath0 which parameterize the probability that a hadron @xmath1 with large momentum @xmath2 is created from a parton @xmath3 with momentum @xmath4 in the vacuum @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for hadron production at asymptotically large momentum transfer the cross section factorizes into a fragmentation function and a perturbative cross section between partons in a well - defined way .",
    "a second example are exclusive processes where the wave functions @xmath5 of the ( few ) lowest fock states of a hadron appear @xcite .    yet another method to deal with hadronization in a simplified way is the quark recombination model @xcite . as in exclusive hadron production",
    "the matrix elements tested are of the same form as the one in exclusive processes @xmath6 .",
    "this is only a formal correspondence , but attempts have been made to connect recombination to both fragmentation @xcite and to exclusive hadron production @xcite .",
    "recombination can be directly applied to describe hadron production in rather dense parton systems @xcite .",
    "the motivation is twofold .",
    "first , there is an expectation that in a dense parton phase fragmentation is not the correct picture for hadron formation .",
    "secondly , it became indeed clear that perturbative hadron production and fragmentation are not sufficient to explain rhic data for hadrons at transverse momenta of several gev/@xmath7 .",
    "this conclusion is mainly based on the observed large baryon / meson ratio @xcite , the nuclear modification factors @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) close to or above unity @xcite and the remarkable scaling law for elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "in central heavy ion collisions a hot and dense fireball of deconfined quarks and gluons is created . in the recombination model one",
    "postulates the existence of thermalized parton degrees of freedom at the phase transition temperature @xmath10 which recombine or coalesce into hadrons .",
    "it has been found to be sufficient to consider the lowest fock state in each hadron , the valence quarks , which are given constituent masses around 300 mev .",
    "the spectrum of hadrons can be calculated starting from a convolution of wigner functions @xcite . for a meson with valence ( anti)quarks @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "we have @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the 2-particle wigner function for partons @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath15 is the wigner function of the meson .",
    "the sum runs over all possible parton quantum numbers . for simplicity",
    "the parton wigner function is usually approximated by a product of single particle phase space distributions @xmath16 .",
    "several slightly different implementations of this formalism have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for earlier reviews .    in order to obtain an estimate when recombination is important as a hadronization mechanism",
    ", one can compare the yields of fragmentation and recombination starting from different parton spectra .",
    "thermal parton spectra @xmath17 play a special role .",
    "recombination of thermal partons leads to an exponential hadron distribution with the same slope since @xmath18 where @xmath19 gives the momentum fraction of parton @xmath11 .",
    "therefore recombination is more effective than fragmentation on any thermalized parton ensemble . on",
    "the other hand one can show that a power - law parton spectrum favors fragmentation at least for large @xmath20 , in accordance with perturbative qcd .",
    "( [ eq : reco ] ) does preserve momentum , but not energy .",
    "therefore it can only be safely applied in a kinematic region where mass effects are small , i.e.  for @xmath21 . on the other hand fragmentation",
    "starts to dominate at very high @xmath20 .",
    "the large jet quenching at rhic further suppresses the contribution from fragmentation , so that recombination effects can be observed at intermediate @xmath20 .",
    "a very good description of hadron spectra and hadron ratios measured at rhic can be achieved by combining hadron production from recombination for intermediate transverse momentum with a perturbative calculation using fragmentation and energy loss in the medium @xcite .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] shows the @xmath20 spectrum of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in central au+au collisions obtained in @xcite .",
    "the agreement with data is very good for @xmath26 gev/@xmath7 .",
    "we note that the hadron spectra exhibit an exponential shape up to about 4 gev/@xmath7 for mesons and up to about 6 gev/@xmath7 for baryons , where recombination of thermal quarks dominates .",
    "above , the spectra follow a power - law and production is dominated by fragmentation .",
    "let us now assume the parton phase exhibits elliptic flow @xmath27 .",
    "recombination makes a prediction for elliptic flow of any hadron species after recombination @xcite : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the number of valence quarks for the hadron .",
    "note that this scaling law is derived using the assumption of infinitely narrow wave functions , such that the momentum is shared equally between the valence partons .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] shows the measured elliptic flow @xmath30 for several hadron species in a plot with scaled axes @xmath31 vs @xmath32 .",
    "all data points ( with exception of the pions ) fall on one universal curve .",
    "this is a an impressive confirmation of the quark scaling rule and the recombination model .",
    "the pions are shifted to lower @xmath20 , because most pions in the detectors , even at intermediate @xmath20 , are not from hadronization , but from secondary decays of hadrons .",
    "this together with allowing a finite width of the wave function can improve the description of the pion data @xcite .",
    "the quark scaling of elliptic flow shows that the relevant degrees of freedom at early times in the collision are partons and they prove that these partons behave collectively .",
    "the @xmath33 meson has long been discussed to provide a good test for the validity of the recombination model @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 mesons are as heavy as protons and the questions is whether they follow the pattern of the other much lighter mesons , or whether they behave like protons and lambdas .",
    "data from rhic now impressively confirm that the elliptic flow and nuclear modification factors of the @xmath33 are very similar to those for kaons @xcite .",
    "this is another success for the recombination model .",
    "nevertheless one should ask to which accuracy one expects the scaling law for elliptic flow to hold .",
    "in particular , are the scaling factors of 2 and 3 indeed excluding any higher fock states in the hadrons ?",
    "a recent study found that higher fock states in an expansion @xmath34 could actually be accommodated @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that the hadron yields from a thermal parton spectrum do not change if additional partons are allowed to coalesce . generally speaking the probability to form a cluster on @xmath29 particles with fixed momentum @xmath2 from a thermal bath is independent of @xmath29 .",
    "the situation changes for elliptic flow .",
    "higher fock states with @xmath29 partons come with their own scaling factor @xmath29 which seems to destroy the scaling with the number of valence quarks . however , under the assumption that the lowest fock state is still dominating",
    ", the numerical effect of the corrections is surprisingly small .",
    "[ fig : hf ] shows the expected violation of the scaling law using the new asymmetry variable @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the _ scaled _ elliptic flow of a meson and a baryon respectively @xcite .",
    "one curve shows @xmath38 for the lowest fock state only and the other two correspond to hadrons which have a higher fock state component with one additional parton with probability 30% and 50% respectively .",
    "realistic wave functions with finite width have been used which leads to a scaling violation even for a pure valence quark configuration .",
    "generally the violations are smaller than 5% .",
    "new data from star analyzes scaling violations in the data and finds them to have the predicted sign and order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the study did not specify the exact nature of the additional partons .",
    "they could be quark antiquark pairs or gluons .",
    "it was discussed for a long time what the fate of gluons in the recombination model is .",
    "one can argue that they have to dress the quarks just above the critical temperature .",
    "after this study it is clear that there is some room to accommodate gluons during the recombination process directly .",
    "further investigations in this direction are necessary .",
    "more and more data on dihadron correlations are available from the rhic experiments @xcite .",
    "the full picture shown by the data seems to be complicated and rich in detail .",
    "before one can even begin to analyze the full data set there is one obvious question .",
    "the measurements find jet - like correlations at intermediate transverse momenta that seem to be coming from jet fragmentation rather than recombination .",
    "how can this be reconciled with the conclusion from single hadron measurements that recombination is the dominant source of hadrons in this kinematic regime ?    originally recombination was successfully applied to describe hadron spectra and elliptic flow starting from assumptions about the parton phase at hadronization .",
    "one crucial simplification always implemented is a factorization of any @xmath29-parton wigner function into a product of independent single parton distributions @xmath39 by definition this factorization does not permit any correlations between partons .",
    "consequently , no hadron correlations can emerge via recombination .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the above factorization was chosen for simplicity and it was justified because single inclusive hadron spectra could be described very well .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that modifications of ( [ eq : prod ] ) including correlations between partons indeed lead to correlations between hadrons after recombination",
    ". the quality of the description of single hadron spectra does not suffer in the process .",
    "the source of jet - like correlations in the parton medium is the strong coupling of jets to the medium .",
    "the energy loss is estimated to be up to 14 gev / fm for a 10 gev parton @xcite .",
    "this implies that most jets apart from those close to the surface are completely stopped , dumping their energy and momentum into a cell of about 1 @xmath40 in the rest frame of the medium .",
    "this results in a dramatic local heating , creating a hot spot in the fireball .",
    "moreover , the directional information of the jet is preserved .",
    "partons of such a hot spot exhibit jet - like correlations .    in @xcite a simple extension of the correlation - free factorization ( [ eq :",
    "prod ] ) was considered ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is assumed that correlations are a small effect and that one can restrict them to 2-particle correlations @xmath41 .",
    "then a 4-parton wigner function can be written @xmath42 the correlation functions @xmath41 between parton @xmath43 and parton @xmath44 can be arbitrary , but one assumes that they vary slowly with momentum and that they are only non - vanishing in a subvolume @xmath45 of the fireball .",
    "a gaussian ansatz @xmath46 seems to be reasonable to describe correlations in azimuthal angle .",
    "the 2-meson yield is given by a convolution of the partonic wigner function @xmath47 with the wigner functions @xmath48 , @xmath49 of the mesons with an additional integration over the hadronization hypersurface @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the correlation strength @xmath51 which permits omitting quadratic terms like @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "we can now study the associated yield @xmath54 for a given trigger hadron @xmath38 in a given kinematic window as a function of the relative azimuthal angle @xmath55 between the two .",
    "one finds @xmath56 the @xmath57 are single particle yields in the kinematic window of the trigger meson or associated meson and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the hadronization volume .",
    "the factor @xmath60 ( for two mesons ) indicates an enhancement of the correlations in the hadron phase compared to the parton phase .",
    "the effect is the same as for the amplification of elliptic flow by the number @xmath29 of valence quarks in the hadron . in the case of 2-parton correlations ,",
    "@xmath61 counts the number of possible correlated pairs between the @xmath62 ( anti)quarks of meson @xmath38 and the @xmath63 ( anti)quarks of meson @xmath36 . in the weak correlation limit where quadratic terms are suppressed only single correlations are counted .",
    "apparently one has @xmath64 thus @xmath65 for a meson - baryon pair and @xmath66 for a baryon - baryon pair .",
    "+    fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] shows the associated yield of hadrons integrated in azimuthal angle around the near side ( @xmath67 ) for the case that the trigger is a baryon ( proton or antiproton ) and a meson ( pion or kaon ) for different centralities .",
    "the kinematic window is 2.5 gev/@xmath684.0 gev/@xmath7 for trigger particles and 1.7 gev/@xmath692.5 gev/@xmath7 for associated particles , and @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "[ fig : res ] shows the associated yield with only fragmentation , and fragmentation and recombination both taken into account together with phenix data @xcite .",
    "a good description of the data can be reached assuming a constant correlation volume .",
    "the parameters used for the fireball are the same that lead to a good description of single hadron spectra and elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "some implementations of recombination take into account the possibility that hard partons can recombine with soft partons @xcite .",
    "this soft - hard recombination smoothens the transition between the pure fragmentation and pure ( thermal ) recombination regions .",
    "it was predicted that typical recombination features like a larger baryon / meson ratio would then extend to even higher @xmath20 , beyond 6 gev/@xmath7 .",
    "indeed such behavior might have been seen in recent data @xcite .",
    "soft - hard recombination could be a correction to fragmentation which is even important in much more dilute systems .",
    "the reason is that fragmentation is an extremely ineffective mechanism to create baryons .",
    "soft - hard recombination is a very good candidate to explain the very larger cronin enhancement for baryons in @xmath72au collisions @xcite .",
    "there is no thermal parton phase created in @xmath72au collisions , but the existence of a cloud of soft partons with exponential spectrum is sufficient to boost baryon production via coalescence .",
    "soft - hard recombination could even be responsible for the suppression of hadrons at forward rapidities in @xmath72au @xcite .",
