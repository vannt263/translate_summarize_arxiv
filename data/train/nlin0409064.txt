    "in ref.@xcite several structure - generating mechanisms , in multi - agent dynamical systems , have been analyzed .",
    "a _ structure _ in a dynamical system is characterized by the emergence of phenomena at scales different from those typical of the dynamics of the agents , when they evolve in isolation .",
    "a _ space - structure _ corresponds to phenomena operating at a scale much larger than the typical size of one agent and a _ time - structure _ is a phenomenon with a time scale much longer than the cycle time of the agents .",
    "an important role in the generation of time - structures is played by modifications to the lyapunov spectrum , occurring either as a result of the agents interaction or of a change of parameters .",
    "a new structure is created each time one lyapunov exponent crosses zero from above . in particular , in one of the mechanisms described in @xcite , the joint effect of chaos in the individual agent evolution law and extremal dynamics , implies that all lyapunov exponents tend to @xmath0 in the infinite agents limit .",
    "this leads to a characteristic behavior free of time scales .",
    "it has been conjectured in ref.@xcite that it is this mechanism that is behind many of the dynamical manifestations of what has been called self - organized criticality ( soc ) . here",
    ", this conjecture is pursued by analyzing a situation @xcite where breakdown of self - organized criticality is exhibited .",
    "it is shown that the breakdown of soc may in fact be understood from the behavior of the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "there is some controversy concerning a rigorous definition of soc . here",
    "only the absence of natural time scales is emphasized , without much concern about space scales , nature of the driving , separation of time scales and other relevant issues useful for a precise characterization of soc .",
    "absence of time scales , as a property of dynamics , is naturally related to the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "time scales disappear whenever the lyapunov exponents vanish .",
    "this leads in a natural way to power laws for both time and space correlation . however , scaling of the avalanches , that is , a power law for the return times to the self - organized state , is a subtler effect .",
    "this is easy to understand when the multi - agent system is formulated as a measure - preserving dynamical system . if the self - organized state @xmath1 , which serves as reference for the counting of return times @xmath2 , is a non - zero measure set @xmath3 , the measure @xmath4 itself serves as a natural time scale",
    "then , the large time behavior of the return times distribution would be dominated by an exponential factor @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , for cases that fit in the ergodic dynamical systems setting , power laws may occur only if the reference set has vanishing measure . in the @xmath6",
    "limit the return times distribution is dominated by the pre - factor that multiplies the exponential and this one might be or not be a power law .",
    "when @xmath7 is an ergodic measure , by kac s lemma , the mean return time to a set @xmath1 is @xmath8 .",
    "therefore when @xmath9 , the numerical evaluation of the return time ( avalanche ) law has to be carried out for a set slightly larger than @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that it may be difficult to disentangle the prefactor dependence from the exponential one , leading to some uncertainty about the exact values of the numerically measured scaling exponents .",
    "in particular because , as seen in sect .",
    "2 , the exponent factor @xmath10 may be a non - trivial function of the measure . instead of obtaining the return times distribution from the histogram , a more robust way is described in sect.2 , based on the construction of the characteristic function .",
    "treating the multi - agent system as a deterministic measure - preserving dynamical system , tools from ergodic theory may be applied .",
    "an important issue is the characterization of asymptotic sets and invariant measures as well as the nature of the relevant attractors and repellers of the scale - free system .",
    "these questions are discussed for a deterministic version of the bak - sneppen model@xcite .",
    "the nature of the self - organized state as a zero - measure subset of the invariant measure is put into evidence .",
    "then , a probabilistic avalanche equation , written for the return times , is used to extract the non - trivial nature of the avalanche process from simulation data .",
    "the original bak - sneppen model @xcite @xcite may be converted into a deterministic dynamical system by defining @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the vector of agent coordinates and @xmath13 a deterministic pseudo - random generator , for example @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is a function which is nearly zero if @xmath17 corresponds to the agent with the minimum @xmath18 value or to one of its @xmath19 neighbors and is nearly one otherwise . in ref.@xcite",
    "the following function was proposed @xmath20 which , for large @xmath21 , satisfies the above conditions .    here , instead , the function @xmath22 will be used , which has a similar behavior for @xmath23 . using a similar function in a stochastic model head@xcite",
    "has shown the breakdown of scale - free behavior for finite non - zero @xmath24 . by using @xmath25 in the deterministic model",
    "one may compare the lyapunov spectrum analysis with the numerical results of head .",
    "in the @xmath26 limit both models are equivalent to the original bak - sneppen model .",
    "fig.1 shows an approximate calculation of the evolution of the lyapunov spectrum for successively decreasing @xmath24 values with @xmath27 agents .",
    "the results were obtained for @xmath28 , @xmath29 time steps and @xmath30 .",
    "the spread in the @xmath31 limit , around the exact value for @xmath27 agents @xmath32 , results from the finite number of time steps .",
    "the deterministic system defined by ( [ 2.1])-([2.3 ] ) closely corresponds to the stochastic system studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore the behavior of the lyapunov spectrum explains why the distribution of jump sizes and activation times obeys power laws only in the @xmath26 limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite the loss of criticality for finite @xmath24 is interpreted in terms of the correlated or uncorrelated nature of the active site jumps .",
    "the lyapunov spectrum interpretation is clearer .",
    "notice also that it is only in the @xmath33 limit that all the lyapunov exponents reach @xmath0 .",
    "it is only in this limit that all time scales disappear @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of the bak - sneppen model is the existence of a sharp probability distribution for the agents coordinates above a barrier @xmath34 .",
    "however , this sharp ( full - measure ) distribution is merely a fixed point for the one - agent marginal , which is the one - dimensional projection of a zero - measure subset of the invariant measure in the @xmath35 dimensional space @xcite .",
    "the fact that in the @xmath36dimensional space the self - organized set to which the system returns after each avalanche is of zero measure is consistent with kac s lemma .",
    "kac s lemma states that for an ergodic invariant measure @xmath7 the average return time to a set @xmath1 of measure @xmath4 is @xmath37 .",
    "therefore for a scaling law @xmath38 , @xmath39 implies @xmath9 .    to exhibit the zero - measure nature of the bak - sneppen state",
    "consider the _ distance process _",
    "@xmath40 defined by @xmath41    fig.2 shows the probability distribution of the distance process for several values of the barrier @xmath42 .",
    "one sees that it is for @xmath42 around @xmath43 that the neighborhood of the @xmath44 point becomes of zero measure .",
    "the bak - sneppen self - organized state is an @xmath35dimensional hypercube of volume @xmath45 .",
    "this set has repelling directions corresponding to the agents that are active and neutral directions for all others .",
    "not being an invariant set it falls outside the usual definition of `` weak repeller '' .",
    "it has been called a `` ghost weak repeller '' in ref . @xcite .    as mentioned before , the zero measure of this `` repeller '' makes the direct measurement of the distribution law of avalanches a delicate matter . on the one hand the barrier value defining the avalanches must be placed close to the critical barrier to avoid the exponential finite - measure effects .",
    "however because the average size of the avalanches is @xmath46 , the closer we are to the critical barrier the worse the statistics becomes .",
    "a bin size has to be chosen to fit the avalanches data to a power law and the accuracy of the exponent is found to be sensitive to the bin size .",
    "logarithmic binning may improve the situation .",
    "however a more robust method is based on the construction of the characteristic function @xmath47 from the data . for each avalanche size @xmath48 , the probability density",
    "may then be obtained by numerical computation of the inverse fourier transform @xmath49 in this way all the data is used for each @xmath48 instead of only the events in the neighborhood of @xmath48 .    for sparse data",
    "this is a very robust way to construct @xmath50 , which is no longer affected by the bin size choice . however in our case we are not only interested in an accurate determination of @xmath50 but also on the extraction of the power law prefactor that multiplies the measure - dependent exponential . in cases where the exponent of the exponential is also a non - trivial function of the measure it is extremely difficult to separate the effect of the two terms",
    "this is especially true if the measure - dependent exponent decreases with the measure ( see the example below ) .",
    "more accurate statements , concerning the nature of the prefactors , are obtained by comparing the characteristic function constructed from the data with the characteristic functions for trial distributions @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53obtained from normalization and kac s lemma , @xmath54 .",
    "this was done for several values of the measure , the results being displayed in fig.3 ( for @xmath55 ) . both the exponential factor @xmath56 and the scaling exponent @xmath21 depend on the measure of the avalanche reference set .",
    "this puts into evidence the unavoidable uncertainties in the direct evaluation of the scaling exponent , in particular because even very close to the critical barrier the scaling exponent still shows a noticeable dependence on the measure of the reference set . in the appendix",
    "the characteristic functions associated to the probability distributions in eq.([2.5 ] ) are discussed in detail as well as some other results concerning return times to small measure sets .",
    "the discussion above refers to the problem of direct determination of the scaling exponents .",
    "however , with the additional assumption , as done by several authors , of a scaling form for @xmath50 near the critical barrier , an estimate of the @xmath57 value may be obtained .",
    "this however relies on the validity of the scaling assumption . assuming that close to @xmath58@xmath59 one obtains @xmath60",
    "then , from kac s lemma , one obtains @xmath61 and from the numerical data for @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "4a ) , @xmath62 , leading to @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "another exponent relates the measure to the position of the barrier @xmath65 with ( fig .",
    "4b ) @xmath66 .",
    "assuming a differentiable dependence of the avalanches on the position of the barrier , maslov @xcite derived an equation for the probability density of avalanche sizes in the bak - sneppen model . here",
    ", a similar equation will be obtained for the return times to a measure @xmath7 set .",
    "this equation is then applied to the bak - sneppen model .",
    "particular attention is paid to the avalanche merging kernel , which in the maslov equation is usually assumed to scale like a power in the critical region , but that may actually have a much more complex form .",
    "assume that a set parametrization may be chosen in such a way that set measures change in a differentiable manner .",
    "differentiating with respect to the measure , one obtains the following equation @xmath67 where @xmath68 eq.([3.1 ] ) is derived by shrinking the measure of the set @xmath1 by the amount @xmath69 and accounting for the number of avalanches of size @xmath48 that become avalanches of larger size and for the number of mergers of smaller avalanches leading to new @xmath70avalanches .",
    "@xmath71 is the probability that the first or the last step of a @xmath70avalanche iteration falls in @xmath69 .",
    "the first term in eq.([3.1 ] ) accounts both for a @xmath70avalanche becoming a larger avalanche and for the change in the total number of events from @xmath27 to @xmath72 .",
    "the second term accounts for the probability for a @xmath73avalanche and a @xmath74avalanche to merge into a @xmath70avalanche .",
    "@xmath75 is the conditional probability to have a @xmath76 avalanche following a @xmath77 one .    with the additional hypothesis of statistical independence between successive avalanches @xmath78    defining @xmath79 ( the characteristic function ) and @xmath80 one obtains @xmath81",
    "so far this is a very general equation that ( with statistical independence of avalanches ) would apply to any dynamical system .",
    "the dynamical information of each system is coded on the `` merging kernel '' @xmath82 . using normalization @xmath83 and kac s lemma @xmath84 in eq.([3.3 ] ) one obtains the following constraints on @xmath85@xmath86 a trivial solution to the constraints ( [ 3.4a ] ) is @xmath87 leading to the equation @xmath88 with solution @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , from normalization and kac s lemma .",
    "otherwise @xmath92 is an arbitrary function of @xmath93 .",
    "however the bak - sneppen model is not in the class of solutions ( [ 3.7 ] ) , because from this equation it follows that @xmath94 should be independent of @xmath7 , which is not verified by the numerical data ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "a power dependence of the merger kernel @xmath95@xmath96 together with the constraints ( [ 3.4a ] ) implies @xmath97 which again , is not borne out by the data .",
    "however from the numerical simulation data ( @xmath55 ) for two close values of the measure and eq.([3.3 ] ) one may obtain direct information on @xmath98 from @xmath99    an example is shown in fig .",
    "6 , where both @xmath100 and @xmath101 are plotted .",
    "the general conclusion from these computations for several measures is that , starting from a non - zero value at @xmath102 , @xmath103 grows relatively fast to the asymptotic value @xmath104 .",
    "a ( weak ) power dependence is only found for small @xmath48 values .",
    "therefore the behavior of the merger kernel , that codes the dynamical information of the bak - sneppen model , seems to be much more complex than thought before .",
    "\\(i ) the deterministic bak - sneppen model , studied in this paper , establishes a clear relation between the lyapunov spectrum and scale - free behavior .",
    "extremal behavior , where only a finite number of agents is active at each time , leads to the vanishing of all lyapunov exponents in the infinite agents limit . on the other hand",
    ", local chaos insures that the convergence to zero is from above .",
    "these seem to be the most common ingredients in systems that display what has been called self - organized criticality .",
    "\\(ii ) the self - organized state in the deterministic bak - sneppen model is an interesting zero - measure subset of the invariant measure . interpreting avalanches as return times to a set @xmath1 ,",
    "one concludes that a scaling law with exponent @xmath105 implies , by kac s lemma , @xmath9 .",
    "therefore one expects the zero measure feature to be present not only in the bak - sneppen model but also in other self - organized states with avalanche scaling laws .",
    "\\(iii ) the avalanche equation , in the measure formulation discussed in section 3 , is a powerful guide to constraint the extraction of dynamical information from dynamical systems of this type . in particular",
    "it provides preliminary evidence on a non - power behavior of the merger kernel .",
    "a stretched exponential behavior converging to @xmath104 seems to be a better guess .",
    "this however is a question that deserves further study .",
    "on a measurable space @xmath106 , consider a differentiable map @xmath24 for which @xmath7 is an ergodic invariant measure .",
    "the _ return time _",
    "@xmath107 to a measurable set @xmath1 starting from a point @xmath108 is @xmath109 the probability to find a return time greater than @xmath48 , starting from an arbitrary point @xmath108 @xmath110 and for a starting point @xmath93 in @xmath1@xmath111 where @xmath112 invariance of the measure implies @xmath113 and because @xmath114@xmath115 because of ergodicity , poincar recurrence implies @xmath116 . on the other hand @xmath117 and for @xmath118 one obtains kac s lemma @xmath119    defining , as in @xcite @xmath120 one obtains from ( [ a5 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) @xmath121 where @xmath122 . by iteration",
    "@xmath123 let @xmath124 then , by standard techniques , as in @xcite , one obtains the estimation @xmath125 this estimate is sharper than the one obtained in @xcite because it involves @xmath126 rather than @xmath127 .",
    "the estimate ( [ a11 ] ) holds whenever @xmath128 .",
    "however it is useless to find @xmath129 in the @xmath6 limit because @xmath130 therefore , a different approach must be followed to control the @xmath131 limit .    for general distributions of the form @xmath132 the characteristic function must satisfy the equation @xmath133 with solution @xmath134 therefore a large family of solutions is obtained simply by specifying the function @xmath10 ( and its inverse @xmath135 ) .",
