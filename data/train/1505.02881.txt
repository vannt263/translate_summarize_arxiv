    "spiral structures in galaxies have been interpreted as `` standing waves '' in a stellar disk ( the so - called quasi - stationary density wave hypothesis ; @xcite ) .",
    "the density waves generate spiral perturbations and affect on the gas flows .",
    "when the gas inside a co - rotation radius overtakes a spiral arm as it moves around a galactic disk , the gas is expected to form a standing shock , called a `` galactic shock '' , at the upstream side of the spiral arm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since such a galactic shock strongly compresses the gas , the galactic spiral dust - lanes and the associated star formation around spiral arms have since been regarded as consequences of the galactic shocks .",
    "the galactic shock hypothesis qualitatively explains the co - h@xmath0 offset distributions observed in some spiral galaxies such as m51 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is still unclear whether a spiral arm rotates with a single pattern speed for several rotational periods ( i.e. , @xmath1 1 gyr ) , as predicted by the quasi - stationary density wave hypothesis .",
    "on the other hand , a transient spiral hypothesis was proposed in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis has been extended to a transient recurrent spiral ( hereafter , `` dynamic spiral '' ) hypothesis by @xmath2-body simulations of stellar disks ( see a review by @xcite ) ; the amplitudes of stellar spiral arms change on the time scale of galactic rotation or even less ( i.e , a few hundreds of myrs ; @xcite ) , and the spiral at any given radius co - rotates with materials @xcite .",
    "@xcite revealed a self - regulating mechanism that maintains multi - arm spiral features for at least 10 gyrs .",
    "the `` dynamic equilibrium '' nature of stellar spiral arms can be attributed to their co - rotational nature @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and wada , baba & saitoh ( ) performed hydrodynamic simulations of the gas flows in dynamic spirals , and showed that gas does not flow through a spiral arm , but rather effectively falls into the spiral potential minimum from both sides of the arm ( called `` large - scale colliding flows '' ) . the dynamic spiral hypothesis is also supported by observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some observational tests for discriminating between quasi - stationary density waves ( i.e. , steady spirals ) and dynamic spirals have been proposed ( see a review by @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new indicator to discriminate between the two spiral models based on the radial distributions of arm - gas offset angles .",
    "the dust lanes locations relative to a stellar spiral arm depend on the gas flow in the spiral galaxy . in the following sections , we demonstrate that the arm - gas offset distributions show different radial dependences between hydrodynamic simulations of steady spiral and dynamic spiral models .",
    "this difference suggests that measuring the radial distribution of the arm - gas offset angles can be a new observational means of distinguishing between the two spiral models .",
    "we performed hydrodynamic simulations in rigidly rotating spiral potentials and @xmath2-body / hydrodynamic simulations of stellar and gas disks with the @xmath2-body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation code asura-2 ( @xcite , ) .      to simulate the gas flows in spiral galaxies with stationary density waves , we impose the rigidly rotating spiral potentials into the axisymmetric potential .",
    "the gravitational potential of the model galaxy consists of an axisymmetric and a non - axisymmetric ( i.e. , spiral ) parts .",
    "the static axisymmetric part of the gravitational potential comprises of a stellar disk , a spherical bulge and halo .",
    "the initial radial distribution of the gas follows an exponential profile with a scale length of @xmath3 kpc , which is motivated by the observations of the milky way galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the spiral potential is controlled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the axisymmetric potential .",
    "this dimensionless parameter measures the gravitational force due to the spiral arms in the direction perpendicular to the arms relative to the radial force from the background axisymmetric potential @xcite .    in the steady spiral runs , we perform two series of runs with the different ism models : the first series is hydrodynamic simulations of an isothermal , non - self - gravitating gas . no star formation and stellar feedback are considered .",
    "the temperature of the gas is assumed to @xmath22 k to effectively include a contribution of turbulent motions .",
    "this ism model corresponds to that assumed in the classical galactic shock theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "panel a of figure [ fig : offset ] ) , the galactic shock is located on the upstream side except for @xmath31 kpc . this is consistent with the predictions by the classical galactic shock theory @xcite . however , the galactic shock is away from the potential minimum and moves upstream if it is near the co - rotation radius ( @xmath32 kpc ) .",
    "this is because the mach number is a function of radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such radial dependence is consistent with @xcite , who found that the pitch angle of gaseous arms is smaller than that of stellar arms ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the radial trend of arm - gas offset angles in steady spirals depends qualitatively on neither the strength nor the pitch angle of the spiral . if we compare results with the different @xmath30 models ( panels a and b in figure [ fig : offset ] ) , the galactic shock locations in si10f05iso model are shifted farther downstream ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "solid green lines in panels b and c in figure [ fig : offset ] indicate the locations of galactic shocks in the si10f05iso model .",
    "the locations of galactic shocks in both models are almost the same .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the definition of @xmath30 .",
    "note that the shocked layers in spiral potentials are not always dynamically stable ( so - called wiggle instability ) .",
    "this is consistent with the previous time - dependent , multi - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the physical origin of wiggle instabilities is a standing problem , although the wiggle instabilities result in forming the substructures such as spurs in the inter - arm regions .",

    "( d ) of figure [ fig : offset ] , we show the radial distribution of the arm - gas offsets for si20f05msg model , which include self - gravity of the gas , radiative cooling , heating and stellar feedback . as suggested by @xcite , the self - gravity of the gas may shift the shock location downstream ( @xcite ) , but a clear radial dependence of the arm - gas offset is still seen in si20f05msg model .",
    "this suggests that an arm - gas offset distribution does not depend on ism modeling , but is essentially determined by dynamical properties of a spiral arm .",
    "we investigate the dust - lane locations in dynamically evolving spiral arms .",

    "a stellar bar is seen at @xmath37 kpc .",
    "properties of spirals are analyzed by using the 1d fourier decomposition method as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the stellar mass distribution and @xmath40 is the azimuthally averaged surface stellar density at radius @xmath41 , and @xmath42 denotes a complex amplitude of the @xmath6-th mode , respectively .",
    "we analyze angular positions and angular phase speeds of spiral arms with the fourier density peak method @xcite .",
    "the angular phase speeds of spiral arms in dynamic spiral models follow the galactic rotation at almost all radii or radially decrease ( bottom panels of figure [ fig : dynamicspiralpatternspeed ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the simulated multi - armed spirals ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as the simulated barred spirals ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which have the radially dependent rotation of spiral arms , but slightly faster than the galactic rotation .",
    "this suggests that spiral arms even in barred galaxies could not be rigid - body rotating patterns predicted by the quasi - stationary density wave theory .",
    "in contrast to the steady spiral models , we can clearly see that the dust lanes are along with stellar spiral arms in the dynamic spiral model ( top panels of figure [ fig : dynamicspiralpatternspeed ] ) .",
    "as shown in the panels ( e ) and ( f ) of figure [ fig : offset ] , the radial distributions of the arm - gas offset angle show no clear radial dependence in dynamic spiral models .",

    "in contrast , the dynamic spiral models show no systematic radial dependence of the arm - gas offsets , since the gas motions follow large - scale colliding flows to form spiral arms .",
    "thus , our results suggest that a radial profile of arm - gas offset angle can be used to distinguish between the two spiral models .    to measure the radial distributions of arm - gas offsets , spatially - resolved wide - field maps of old stars and cold gas are required .",
