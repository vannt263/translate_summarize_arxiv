    "characterising quantum states of matter has been a subject of fervent activity for some years now , using a variety of techniques .",
    "terms such as order parameter , renormalisation group , excitation gap , entanglement , fidelity , topological invariant , and conformal invariance are commonly found in the identification of quantum critical ( or quantum phase transition ) points between distinct quantum phases . in @xcite",
    "it was proposed that quantum criticality may be identified by deconfined ( or emergent ) excitations at the critical point , which are not found in phases adjacent to the critical point . here",
    "we present a pairing hamiltonian of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) form @xcite which provides an example of this phenomenon through two lines of critical points .",
    "this model has five properties which , in combination , give it a unique profile : 1 ) the model admits an exact bethe ansatz solution whereby the energy spectrum associated to the deconfined excitations can be calculated analytically ; 2 ) the deconfined excitations exist for finite - sized systems , not just in the thermodynamic limit ; 3 ) the deconfined excitations obey generalised exclusion statistics ; 4 ) the hamiltonian is non - hermitian but has a real spectrum on the critical lines ; 5 ) the spectrum of deconfined excitations is invariant under a renormalisation group map .",
    "the general form for a reduced bcs hamiltonian as originally discussed in @xcite is given by @xmath0 here , @xmath1 enumerates doubly - degenerate , single - particle energy levels with energy @xmath2 for level @xmath3 .",
    "the operators @xmath4 are annihilation and creation operators for fermions at level @xmath3 , and @xmath5 are fermion number operators . the labels @xmath6 refer to pairs of time - reversed states . throughout",
    "we will work with a _ picket fence _",
    "model whereby the @xmath2 are uniformly and symmetrically distributed around zero .",
    "in particular we choose @xmath7 where the level spacing @xmath8 provides an energy scale for the system .",
    "the study of exactly solvable cases of bcs hamiltonians originates from the work of richardson @xcite dealing with uniform couplings @xmath9 for all @xmath10 .",
    "this case is also known as the @xmath11-wave pairing model .",
    "our interest is in the choice @xmath12 for two independent parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this contains the richardson subcase when @xmath15 .",
    "the instance where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are a complex conjugate pair is known as the _ russian doll _ model , which has a self - adjoint hamiltonian .",
    "it was introduced in @xcite as an example of a many - body system admitting a cyclic renormalisation group map , motivated by the one - body model of glazek and wilson @xcite .",
    "the russian doll model was shown to be exactly solvable in @xcite .",
    "below we study ( [ h_bcs],[pf],[gees ] ) for real - valued @xmath16 .",
    "it will be shown that the critical lines are given by @xmath17    an important feature of the hamiltonian ( [ h_bcs ] ) is the blocking effect .",
    "for any unpaired fermion at level @xmath3 , the action of the pairing interaction is zero since only paired fermions are scattered .",
    "this means that the hilbert space can be decoupled into a product of paired and unpaired fermion states in which the action of the hamiltonian on the space for the unpaired fermions is diagonal in the basis of number operator eigenstates . in view of this property the pair number operator @xmath18 commutes with ( [ h_bcs ] ) and",
    "thus provides a good quantum number . throughout , @xmath19 will be used to denote the eigenvalues of the pair number operator , while @xmath20 will denote the eigenvalues of the total fermion number operator @xmath21 .",
    "first we address that issue that the hamiltonian is generally non - hermitian for real - valued @xmath16 , so is not guaranteed to have a real spectrum ( except when @xmath15 , or when either of @xmath22 is zero ) .",
    "the study of non - hermitian hamiltonians with real spectra has attracted intense activity @xcite .",
    "numerical diagonalisation for small system sizes shows that ( [ h_bcs ] ) subject to ( [ pf],[gees ] ) does give rise to complex spectra for some choices of the coupling parameters , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the numerical results show that the boundaries between real and complex spectra are close to the lines given by ( [ crit ] ) .",
    "next we turn to the exact solution of the hamiltonian to show that ( [ crit ] ) are associated with deconfined excitations obeying generalised exclusion statistics .",
    "the exact solution for ( [ h_bcs ] ) subject to ( [ gees ] ) was obtained using the techniques of the _ quantum inverse scattering method _ and _ algebraic bethe ansatz _ @xcite . in order to present the exact solution , which is adapted from @xcite , it is useful to make a change of variables .",
    "we parameterise the coupling constants @xmath23 through variables @xmath24 , @xmath25 such that @xmath26 for our purposes it will be sufficient to restrict the subsequent analysis to the subspace with no unpaired fermions ( i.e. @xmath27 ) .",
    "the exact solution for the energy spectrum on this subspace is @xmath28 where the @xmath29 , are solutions of the system of _ bethe ansatz equations _ @xmath30 with @xmath31 . each of the solutions @xmath32 may be viewed as the energy of a fermion in a cooper pair quasiparticle .",
    "however these quasiparticles are typically bound rather than free , since a solution set for @xmath19 quasiparticles is not simply the union of one - body solutions due to the coupled nature of ( [ bae ] ) .    in general the eqs .",
    "( [ bae ] ) can not be solved analytically . however setting @xmath33 , and recalling ( [ pf ] )",
    ", it is seen that the polynomials @xmath34 and @xmath35 share a set of common roots .",
    "specifically @xmath36 for @xmath37 where @xmath38 for this case we obtain analytic solutions of ( [ bae ] ) by choosing @xmath39 for @xmath40 , with associated energies given by ( [ nrg ] ) . a remarkable property of these solutions",
    ", corresponding to the lines ( [ crit ] ) , is that the energies are independent of the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "this justifies identifying them with deconfined excitations which do not occur for generic values of @xmath23 .",
    "note however that these particular solutions which occur on the critical lines are _ not _ associated with the ground state of the model , and that there is a gap between the ground and excited states .    for these deconfined excitations a free quasiparticle interpretation _ is _ appropriate , since a solution set for @xmath19 particles is simply the union of one - body solutions chosen from @xmath41 .",
    "however there are still restrictions that apply to the possible choices , which leads to the picture of free quasiparticles obeying generalised exclusion statistics in the sense proposed by haldane @xcite .",
    "partially deconfined excitations also occur , where some roots belong to @xmath41 and others do not , but will not be discussed here .",
    "next we state the main result before explaining the details behind it :    for the hamiltonian ( [ h_bcs ] ) subject to ( [ pf],[gees],[crit ] ) , consider a set @xmath42 where each @xmath43 as given by ( [ s ] ) .",
    "then @xmath44 gives rise to an energy eigenvalue of a deconfined excitation through ( [ nrg ] ) provided that for each pair @xmath45 we have @xmath46 .",
    "for given @xmath47 and @xmath48 the total number of deconfined excitations is @xmath49 and they are said to obey generalised exclusion statistics .",
    "a consequence is that deconfined excitations do not occur for filling fractions greater than 1/2 .",
    "this result stems from certain aspects of the representation theory of the yangian algebra @xmath50 associated to the lie algebra @xmath51 @xcite , which is the algebraic structure underpinning the exact solution of the hamiltonian through the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite . for our purposes we view this algebra as being dependent on a variable , which in the present context corresponds to @xmath25",
    ".    the finite - dimensional , highest - weight modules of @xmath50 are characterised by a polynomial , in an analogous way that finite - dimensional , highest - weight modules of @xmath51 are characterised by a highest - weight vector .",
    "typically such a polynomial is termed a _",
    "drinfeld polynomial_. every polynomial is a drinfeld polynomial , through its decomposition into _ strings _",
    "@xcite , for some finite - dimensional , highest - weight module . given a polynomial @xmath52 of order @xmath47 , if @xmath52 and @xmath53 do not have common roots then the @xmath50-module which has @xmath52 as its drinfeld polynomial is irreducible of dimension @xmath54 .",
    "if the roots are then varied such that a common root does occur , at say @xmath55 , the module contains a non - trivial submodule .",
    "in such a case we can write @xmath56 such that @xmath57 .",
    "then the module associated to @xmath52 contains a submodule containing a highest - weight state associated with the drinfeld polynomial @xmath58 .    for the case at hand with generic values of the level spacing @xmath8 ,",
    "the drinfeld polynomial is the polynomial @xmath34 which appears in ( [ bae ] ) and is associated with an irreducible module .",
    "however setting @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 have many common roots and non - trivial submodules arise . for a given index @xmath3 , @xmath59 with @xmath60 ,",
    "consider the expression @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a polynomial of degree @xmath63 .",
    "we set @xmath64 and @xmath65 such that @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 . by the previous discussion",
    "the module associated with @xmath34 contains a submodule with a highest - weight state associated with the drinfeld polynomial @xmath69 .",
    "this highest - weight state has energy @xmath70 .",
    "the module associated with @xmath34 also contains a submodule with a highest - weight state associated to the drinfeld polynomial @xmath71 .",
    "this highest - weight state has energy @xmath72 .",
    "now @xmath73 but @xmath74 , and @xmath75 but @xmath76 .",
    "so there is no highest - weight state to be found with energy @xmath77 .",
    "for this reason we can not take both @xmath78 and @xmath79 as elements of a solution set for ( [ bae ] ) .",
    "a straightforward counting argument leads to ( [ number ] ) . at a mathematical level",
    "the hamiltonian is very closely related in some respects , but quite different in others , to the haldane - shastry model @xcite for which @xmath50 also plays an intimate role @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that some distinguishing features of the haldane - shastry model are that the energy levels are known analytically , they contain high degeneracies , they have integer spacing ( in appropriate units ) , and the excitations are categorised as being _ semionic _",
    "this bears some similarity to the spectrum of deconfined excitations described above .",
    "the quantum lax operator as given in @xcite for the haldane - shastry model is equivalent , up to a non - unitary transformation , to the quantum lax operator for ( [ h_bcs ] ) .",
    "the transfer matrix obtained by using the form of the lax operator in @xcite is self - adjoint on the critical lines , from which it follows that the spectrum of ( [ h_bcs],[pf],[gees ] ) is real on the critical lines .",
    "a key difference is the inclusion of the `` twist in the boundary conditions '' parameterised by the variable @xmath24 @xcite , which does not have an analogue in the haldane - shastry model .",
    "another contrasting feature is that the haldane - shastry model hamiltonian is not derived from a transfer matrix associated to the yangian algebra , but is more closely related to the quantum determinant @xcite .",
    "the motivation of @xcite to introduce the russian doll model was for the study of cyclic renormalisation group maps .",
    "the mathematical difference between the russian doll model and the non - hermitian model considered here is simply through the change of variables @xmath80 .",
    "thus we can directly transcribe the renormalisation group map for the non - hermitian model from the results of @xcite . for a system of @xmath47 levels ,",
    "eliminating high magnitude energy degrees of freedom associated with @xmath81 or @xmath82 leads to a system of @xmath83 levels with renormalised coupling constants @xmath84 from ( [ change ] ) and ( [ rg ] ) it is seen that @xmath25 is invariant under the renormalisation group map , while @xmath24 is not . as the spectrum of deconfined states on the critical lines is independent of @xmath24 , this spectrum is also invariant under ( [ rg ] ) .",
    "finally we make some comments on results obtained through a mean - field analysis , the details of which will be deferred to a later publication .",
    "we introduce a cut - off energy @xmath85 by setting @xmath86 such that @xmath87 and @xmath88 . letting @xmath89 , @xmath90 , in the continuum limit @xmath91 we obtain from mean - field techniques the following expressions for the chemical potential @xmath92 and gap parameter @xmath93 : @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "note that @xmath96 for all @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "the elementary excitation spectrum is found to be given by @xmath99 we obtain the gound - state energy per fermion as @xmath100 note that in the hermitian limit @xmath101 for which @xmath102 , both @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be evaluated through use of @xmath103 .",
    "in particular for half - filling @xmath104 we obtain @xmath105 and @xmath106 which is in agreement with the classic @xmath11-wave result obtained in @xcite ( equation ( 2.40 ) ) .    from the above results we point out the following two observations , which pose some open questions to be addressed in future work .    * in the mean - field approximation the non - hermitian hamiltonian has real spectrum for all couplings @xmath107 and filling fractions @xmath108 .",
    "it might be expected that mean - field results are exact in the thermodynamic limit ( e.g. see @xcite for when @xmath109 ) .",
    "it would be very useful to determine whether or not the energy spectrum is real to leading order , with complex terms only appearing in lower order corrections . * in terms of the mean - field variables the critical lines ( [ crit ] ) correspond to @xmath110 . here",
    "the mean - field excitation spectrum of the bogoliubov quasiparticles does not obviously display some subset of excitations with the property of being invariant with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "it is consequently not clear whether it is possible to reproduce generalised exclusion statistics within the bogoliubov quasiparticle picture .",
