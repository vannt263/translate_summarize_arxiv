    "we present constraints on anomalous charged current couplings of the @xmath3 derived from an analysis of the branching fractions for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where charge - conjugate decays are implied .",

    "the sensitivity of these branching ratios to a non - zero neutrino mass and mixing with a heavy fourth generation neutrino has been considered elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the effects of anomalous weak charged current dipole moment couplings at the @xmath18 vertex are described by the effective lagrangian @xmath19                        p_l \\nu_\\tau w^\\mu \\nonumber \\\\                        & & + ( { \\mathrm{hermitian\\ conjugate}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the left - handed projection operator and the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the ( cp - conserving ) magnetic and ( cp - violating ) electric dipole form factors respectively  @xcite .",

    "both leptonic tau decay modes probe the charged current couplings of the transverse @xmath1 , and are sensitive to @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in contrast , only the @xmath5 channel is sensitive to @xmath0 due to a relative suppression factor of @xmath27 for the @xmath4 channel .",
    "semi - leptonic tau branching fractions are not considered here since they are insensitive to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath0 .",
    "we use the recently updated world average values for the measured tau branching fractions  @xcite : @xmath28 and @xmath29 . substituting in eq .  [",

    "the uncertainty on our measurement of @xmath33 is significantly smaller than that obtained by stahl using the same technique @xmath44  @xcite and more recent determinations using the shape of momentum spectra of muons from @xmath3 decays @xmath45  @xcite .",

    "anomalous magnetic moments due to compositeness are expected to be of order @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the compositeness scale  @xcite .",

    "these results are comparable to those obtained from anomalous weak neutral current couplings  @xcite and more stringent than those obtained for anomalous electromagnetic couplings  @xcite .",
    "many extensions of the standard model , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) , involve an extended higgs sector with more than one higgs doublet .",
