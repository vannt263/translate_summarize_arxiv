    "the pulsar psr b1828@xmath011 shows long - term , highly periodic and correlated variations in both the pulse shape and the slow - down rate .",
    "its variations are best described as harmonically related sinusoids , with periods of approximately 1000 , 500 and 250 days @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon indicates the most compelling evidence for precession @xcite .    to explain this phenomenon ,",
    "some authors @xcite have proposed different models within the framework of free precession .",
    "the observation could not be a problem in the standard view of neutron stars if the star s crust is free to precess . in @xcite ,",
    "the correlated changes in the pulse duration and spin period derivative can be explained as a precession of the star s rigid crust coupled to the magnetic dipole torque .",
    "@xcite modelled the timing behavior with the inclusion of both geometrical and spin - down contributions to the residuals .",
    "however , investigations concerned on internal structure of neutron stars show that free precession may be damped out if vortices pinning to the stellar crust and hydrodynamics ( mhd ) coupling are taken into consideration . in detail , the rotation of the superfluid , accounting for a large proportion of the moment of inertia of the pulsar , is contained in an array of vortices . models , in which vortices pinned to the stellar crust become unpinned during a glitch , might have described the occurrence of and recovery from glitches @xcite .",
    "the vortex pinning will damp out free precession on timescales of several hundred precession periods @xcite if the pinning force is as strong as suggested in the glitch models . additionally , the mhd coupling between the crust and the core will also strongly affect precession of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "the decay of precession , caused by the mutual friction between the neutron superfluid and the plasma in the core , is expected to occur over tens to hundreds of precession periods and may be measurable over a human lifetime . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the picture of vortex lines entangled in flux tubes appears to be incompatible with observations of long - period precession , which indicates that the standard scenario of the outer core ( superfluid neutrons in co - existence with type ii , superconducting protons ) should be reconsidered .",
    "an alternative way is to consider the pulsar as a solid quark star @xcite , where precession models will not receive puzzle that damping out brings .",
    "but there are still some problems when here we come to the model of free precession .",
    "for example , the ellipticity ( or dynamical flattening ) of the pulsar derived from free precession model is not fitted well with the one calculated by maclaurin approximation .",
    "consider the pulsar as a rotation ellipsoid with the principal moment of inertia @xmath6 and the corresponding radii @xmath7 .",
    "in free precession models , the stellar dynamical flattening is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the spin period , @xmath10 is the precession period of the pulsar and @xmath11 is the stellar eccentricity .",
    "it can be approximated as @xmath12 since @xmath13 .",
    "meanwhile , from maclaurin approximation , the stellar ellipticity can be determined by @xmath14/(c / a)^{2/3}\\approx e^{2}/3\\approx2\\epsilon/3\\approx3\\times10^{-3}p_{\\rm 10ms}^{-2}\\approx2\\times10^{-6}$ ] @xcite .",
    "these two values , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are expected to be generally matched if free precession model is available , are quite different . therefore , new ideas need to be devised to explain the phenomenon of precession instead of the free precession ones .",
    "actually , a forced precession model driven by an fossil disk was presented in @xcite .    here",
    "we alternatively present a quark planet model to explain the phenomenon of precession . in this model ,",
    "forced precession is caused by a quark planet orbiting the pulsar . in sect .",
    "2 , first we establish the relation between mass of the pulsar and orbital radius of the planet in case that the dynamical flattening is obtained from maclaurin approximation @xcite .",
    "then we explain why the planet should be a quark planet , rather than a normal one like the earth or jupiter when planet model is referred to .",
    "next we limit movement of the pulsar around the center of mass by errors in the toas ( time - of - arrival ) .",
    "death - line criterion and limitation on gravitation wave radiation timescale are also considered so as to constrain orbital radius , mass of the pulsar and mass of the planet . in sect .",
    "3 , we calculate the precession period derivative and gravitational wave radiation strength of the pulsar for different mass of the pulsar and orbital radius of the planet . in sect.4 , we conclude by discussing the formation of such system and expecting further observation to test the model .",
    ") and orbital radius ( @xmath3 ) for 500-day precession period from eq .",
    "we can have @xmath17 if @xmath18 is not close to @xmath19 .",
    "the figure indicates that reasonable value of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) may be found while @xmath3 is less than @xmath22 cm .",
    "[ 1],width=288 ]    first of all , we suppose that the pulsar psr1828@xmath011 could be either neutron star or quark star since both are candidate models for pulsar . in case",
    "that the precession period is much more than the spin period and the orbital period , the angular velocity of forced precession can be expressed as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the precession angular velocity , @xmath25 is the rotational angular velocity of the spinning pulsar , @xmath3 is orbital radius of the planet , @xmath26 is gravitational constant , @xmath2 is mass of the planet , @xmath27 is the stellar dynamical flattening and @xmath18 is average inclination of planet orbit . from eq . ( 1 ) we can have @xmath28 where @xmath29 is spin period and @xmath30 is precession period of the pulsar .",
    "if we consider a normal planet similar to the earth or jupiter , the typical value of @xmath3 should be 0.1 au or 1 au and the corresponding value of @xmath2 is much larger than the solar mass . in fig .",
    "1 , the relation between @xmath31 and @xmath3 is shown derived from the 500-day precession period .",
    "we can see that if @xmath3 reaches @xmath32 and @xmath18 is not close to @xmath19 , mass of the planet will be over the solar mass .",
    "a planet needs to be of several billion times of @xmath33 to provide enough torque if it locates at 1 au away from the pulsar .",
    "we can not believe the existence of such a planet since it would definitely induce huge orbital timing effects in the pulse residuals .",
    "however , the result is not surprising because the pulsar has a much shorter forced precession period and thus the torque that dominates the precession needs to be much stronger .",
    "meanwhile , precession torque is reduced when the distance between the pulsar and the planet becomes longer .",
    "consequently , if there is a planet close to the pulsar , it may be able to provide enough torque to cause the short - period precession .",
    "that is the reason that we consider quark planet since its orbital radius could mainly depend on the kick energy , which can vary in a large range ( sect .",
    "4 ) .    therefore",
    ", we suppose that the orbital radius of the planet is between ( @xmath34 cm , @xmath22 cm ) , where @xmath34 cm is typical radius of a normal neutron star .",
    "besides , for psr b1828@xmath011 , the errors in the toas ( time - of - arrival ) are limited by random noise to about @xmath35 0.2 ms @xcite .",
    "so in such a planetary system , the pulsar is not likely to move more than about @xmath36 cm around the center of mass , and its orbital radius should be less than @xmath37 cm .",
    "in addition , if the eccentricity of the orbit is not considerable , we can have @xmath38 , where @xmath1 and @xmath39 are mass of the pulsar and its orbital radius around the center of mass , respectively .",
    "since @xmath39 has a maximum @xmath40=@xmath37 cm , the relation can be derived as @xmath41 .",
    "finally , in such a planetary system , mass of the pulsar should be much larger than that of the planet so we approximately assume @xmath42 .",
    "( the orbital radius of the planet ) and @xmath1 ( the mass of the pulsar ) by observations and theoretical arguments .",
    "the shadowed ` available ' region surrounded by line ( 1)(5 ) is the parameter space for @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "the five lines are defined by eq .",
    "( 20)(24 ) .",
    "in this figure we use @xmath43 , since the locations of line ( 1)(3 ) will not change much with variation of average inclination of planet orbit @xmath18 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "[ 2],width=288 ]    next we consider the gravitational wave radiation ( gwr ) of the planetary system for further limitation . in normal double neutron star system ,",
    "the distance between the two stars is about @xmath46 cm .",
    "therefore the timescale of gwr is rather long , usually @xmath47 years @xcite .",
    "however , in this quark planet system , due to the short distance between the two objects , the power of gwr may be significantly larger . in double - star system",
    "it is given by  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the semi - major axis of the orbit , @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the reduced mass .",
    "the gwr costs the total of potential energy and dynamic energy of the planetary system @xmath52 so timescale of gwr can be derived as @xmath53 if the planetary system is stable , the timescale must be long enough . here",
    "we approximately set it as @xmath54 years@xmath55 s.    additionally , we consider the death - line criterion , which requests the potential drop at the polar cap of the pulsar be more than @xmath56 v @xcite .",
    "if we assume that psr1828@xmath011 is an aligned pulsar , potential drop is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the polar magnetic field strength at pulsar surface , @xmath59 is the pulsar radius , @xmath60 is the density of the pulsar and @xmath61 is the opening half - angle of the polar cap .",
    "here we use the density for quark stars to obtain the lower limit of @xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic field can be approximated by @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the principal moment of inertia .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , the relation between potential drop and mass of the pulsar can be derived as below @xmath64 while @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 actually , the assumption of alignment in psr1828@xmath011 is rather strong .",
    "the potential drop from eq .",
    "( 6 ) can be larger by more than one order of magnitude if the inclination of the magnetic axis to the spin axis is not zero @xcite .",
    "consequently , constraint on mass of the pulsar can be lower by about one magnitude and thus we have @xmath67 .",
    "now there are five limitations for @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 : @xmath68 if we consider @xmath69 and substitute for @xmath2 in term of @xmath3 according to eq .",
    "( 2 ) , then the limitations can be derived as @xmath70    in fig .",
    "2 we consider the above limitations and figure out the available range for @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "accordingly , point ( @xmath3 , @xmath1 ) should be above line ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , below line ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) and on the right of line ( 4 ) .",
    "so we have the shadowed area as the `` available '' area for point ( @xmath3 , @xmath1 ) . line ( 1)-(5 )",
    "are defined as below @xmath71 from fig .",
    "2 , the available value range of @xmath3 , @xmath72 and @xmath2 are ( @xmath34 cm , @xmath73 cm ) , ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) and ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) . here",
    "we use @xmath43 because the positions of line ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) do not vary distinctly with the changing of @xmath18 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "different value ranges of @xmath78 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 with different @xmath79 are shown in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "loss of the total energy of the system caused by gravitational wave radiation will lead to decay of the planet orbit .",
    "correspondingly , precession period will be reduced with the decreasing of orbital radius . meanwhile , the planetary system may act as a detectable gravitational wave source .",
    "therefore , it is possible to test and improve the model by gwr detection and long - period observation for precession period derivative ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "so next we calculate @xmath80 and the characteristic amplitude of gwr source strength ( @xmath81 ) for different @xmath78 and @xmath1 , respectively . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , if orbital radius has a slight change , the variation of @xmath10 can be expressed as @xmath82 in this case we do not consider the change of spin period ( the result will prove its reasonableness ) .",
    "similarly , from eq .",
    "( 4 ) we have @xmath83 in addition , the slight change of mechanical energy is caused by gwr in a short period ( see eq .",
    "[ 3 ] ) @xmath84 considering @xmath69 and combining eq . ( 25)(27 ) give the period derivative of precession as below @xmath85 meanwhile , rate of loss of angular momentum caused by gwr is @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the rate of loss of the total energy , @xmath88 is the period of revolution of the planet and @xmath89=3.58 kpc @xcite is the distance of the pulsar .",
    "@xmath90 is the source s ` angle - averaged ' field strength ( at earth ) and approximately we have @xmath91 ( @xmath92 , see @xcite ) . combining eq .",
    "( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 29 ) gives @xmath93 besides , the frequency of gwr is @xmath94    , dash lines ) , the perturbed metric ( @xmath90 , dot lines ) , and gravitational wave frequency ( @xmath95 , dash - dot lines ) are drawn .",
    "here we use @xmath43 in the calculations .",
    "the available area gives model - permitted parameter space for @xmath80 , @xmath90 and @xmath95 .",
    "[ 3],width=288 ]    in fig .",
    "3 , relations between @xmath3 and @xmath2 from eq . ( 28 ) for a group of @xmath80 , from eq . ( 31 ) for a group of @xmath90 and from eq . ( 32 ) for a group of @xmath95 are shown ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the relations are limited by the available area for point ( @xmath3 , @xmath2 ) from fig .",
    "1 . as is shown , the maximum and minimum of @xmath80 are @xmath97 and @xmath98 while those of @xmath90 are @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the result indicates that the precession period changes much quickly than spin period of the pulsar and gwr at earth is not intense enough to be detected by ligo at its working frequency .",
    "for example , at a frequency of 10 hz , value of @xmath90 is about @xmath101 , which is below the current detection limit of the ligo at the same frequency ( about @xmath102 ) .",
    "within the framework of forced precession , we propose a quark planet model to explain the precession of psr b1828@xmath011 .",
    "the observed phenomenon can be understood by a pulsar ( probably a quark star ) together with a quark planet which torques dominantly the pulsar to precess . in principle",
    ", orbital radius of the quark planet should be between @xmath34 cm and @xmath103 cm while the range of mass of the pulsar and the planet are approximately ( @xmath74 , @xmath104 ) and ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) , respectively .",
    "these results might not be strange since other candidates of low - mass quark stars were also discussed previously @xcite .",
    "we calculate the model - permitted precession period derivative and characteristic amplitude of gwr for the system .",
    "the precession period changes much quickly than spin period of the pulsar ; meanwhile , gwr strength at earth may not be large enough to be detected by current ligo .",
    "if there is a quark planet providing torque for the forced precession of pulsar psr b1828@xmath011 , it should be close to the pulsar with a distance of several times of the pulsar s radius .",
    "the pulsar mass should also be significantly lower than @xmath107 , which may suggest that the pulsar would be a quark star .",
    "such kind of planets , orbiting closely to the center pulsars , could be ejecta during the formation of the quark stars with strong turbulence if the surface energy is reasonably low @xcite .",
    "considering the orientation of the system s angular momentum , the planet is not likely to have a inclination of orbit very close to @xmath19 and our previous analysis with @xmath18 varying from @xmath44 to @xmath19 can work effectively .    in this paper",
    "we do not consider the possibility of more than one planet , which may provide a way to explain the other two possible precession periods of the pulsar .",
    "the limitation on orbital radius and ratio of the pulsar mass to the planet one could be improved if the formation of the system is considered .",
    "however , precession periods of the pulsar can not be exactly obtained now from the seemingly periodic post - fit timing residuals .",
    "long - period timing observations in the future are necessary in order to obtain more accurate precession period derivative of the system .",
    "since 2000 , the pulsar has accomplished several precession period .",
    "therefore , if precession period derivative reaches its maximum in this model , the precession period may have changed several days .",
    "in addition , we need observation for gravitational wave to test and improve the model . whether it can be detected or not will both provide further limitation on mass of the pulsar and orbital radius of the planet",
    ".    the model could also be tested by x - ray observation .",
    "( 1 ) if the pulsar is a solid quark star with @xmath108 and then @xmath1092  km , the rate of rotation energy loss could be only about @xmath110 times smaller than that in the standard model where the pulsar is a normal neutron star .",
    "assuming that only @xmath111 of the spin - down power could turn into the non - thermal x - ray luminosity @xcite , the flux at earth should be about @xmath112 ( less than 1 photon/60 hours ) .",
    "( 2 ) the thermal x - ray emissivity from the pulsar could also be lower .",
    "if thermal emission is from the global star , the flux should be @xmath113@xmath114 and @xmath115 @xmath114 for the pulsar with surface temperatures of 200 ev and 100 ev , respectively .",
    "taking absorption into consideration , we can expect a flux of @xmath116 @xmath114 ( about 70 photons/6 hours ) .",
    "but if the pulsar is a neutron star with radius 10 km and surface temperature @xmath117 ev , years old pulsar is @xmath118 ev . ]",
    "the flux is much higher , @xmath119 @xmath114 .",
    "future observations of the pulsar by chandra or xmm - newton could certainly bring us more details about the real nature .",
    "finally , we note that the nature of pulsars ( to be neutron or quark stars ) is still a matter of debate even after 40 years of the discovery .",
    "the reason for this situation is in both theory ( the uncertainty of non - perturbative nature of strong interaction ) and observation ( the difficulty to distinguish them ) .",
    "it is a non - mainstream idea that pulsars are actually quark stars , but this possibility can not be ruled out yet according to either first principles or observations .",
    "`` low - mass '' is a natural and direct consequence if pulsars are quark stars since quark stars with mass @xmath120 are self - confined by color interaction rather by gravity .",
    "an argument against the low - mass idea could be the statistical mass - distribution of pulsars in binaries ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "however this objection might not be so strong due to @xcite : ( 1 ) if the kick energy is approximately the same , only solar - mass pulsars can survive in binaries as low - mass pulsars may be ejected by the kick ; ( 2 ) low - mass bare strange stars might be uncovered by re - processing the timing data of radio pulsars if the pulsars mass is not conventionally supposed to be @xmath122 . in this work , we just try to understand the peculiar precession nature of psr b1828 - 11 in the quark star scenario , since the mainstream - scientific solution to precession might not be simple and natural .    _",
