    "the classification of quantum systems according to universal statistical properties is one of the central objectives in the study of quantum chaos .",
    "it is generally believed that the spectral statistics of systems with chaotic classical limit are governed by random matrix ensembles , while systems with integrable classical dynamics follow the statistical properties of independent random variables from a poisson process @xcite .",
    "interestingly , certain billiards in rational polygons fall in neither of the two universality classes : the energy level correlations are conjectured to be of intermediate type @xcite . in particular , this means that the consecutive level spacing distribution @xmath0 exhibits level repulsion similar to random matrix eigenvalues , but has an exponential tail as for independent random variables .",
    "furthermore , the spectral form factor @xmath1 is intermediate between 0 and 1 in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "one standard example for a statistics of this type is the semi - poisson distribution , for which @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in this paper",
