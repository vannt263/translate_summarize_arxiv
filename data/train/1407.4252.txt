    "dipolar bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have been produced with chromium @xcite , dysprosium @xcite , and erbium @xcite atoms .",
    "all of these atoms have a large magnetic moment , causing them to interact with an appreciable dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) , which is both long - ranged and anisotropic @xcite .",
    "there is significant interest in flattened dipolar becs , produced by an external trapping potential that confines one direction tightly .",
    "for example , experiments have confirmed that flattened dipolar becs , with dipoles polarised normal to the trap plane , are stable against an attractive short - ranged contact interaction @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions for this regime include the emergence of novel density oscillating condensate ground states @xcite , enhanced density fluctuations @xcite , roton - like excitations @xcite , and modified collective and superfluid properties @xcite .",
    "additionally , for a negative ddi ( e.g.  produced by rapidly rotating the dipoles @xcite ) it has been predicted that stable 2d bright solitons can be produced @xcite .",
    "we also note that stacks of flattened systems ( e.g.  as can be produced by an optical lattice ) are of interest ( e.g.  see @xcite ) , where inter - layer interactions add to the richness of the physics . tilting the dipoles relative to",
    "the flattened trap leads to anisotropy in superfluid properties , spectra and density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "quantitative calculations for the mean field ground states and quasiparticle excitations of flattened dipolar becs are difficult , because fundamentally the problem is still fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) and requires a number of specialised numerical techniques to deal with the ddi @xcite .",
    "as such the most comprehensive calculations are restricted to cylindrically symmetric regimes , which requires the dipoles to be polarised along the symmetry axis of the trap .",
    "one simplification , commonly referred to as the _ quasi-2d approximation _",
    "@xcite , is based on the assumption that the system is in the harmonic oscillator ground state in the tightly confined direction , which can then be integrated out leaving an effective 2d theory .",
    "this approximation is only valid when interactions are weak , and many regimes of interest ( e.g.  roton excitations or the collapse instability ) occur where this condition is violated @xcite ( also see @xcite ) . for systems with 3d confinement ,",
    "a comparison of the quasi-2d approximation to other approaches was presented by wilson _",
    "et al . _",
    "that work suggests that the quasi-2d approximation furnishes a qualitatively useful description , even though it is quantitatively inaccurate , e.g.  the ddi strength at which collapse occurs is overestimated by a factor of about three ( see fig .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "an increasing number of studies of flattened dipolar becs have been based on the quasi-2d approximation ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore essential to develop a better quantitative theory for the flattened system in the regime where the quasi-2d approximation is only qualitatively correct , particularly because of the interesting physics that is predicted to occur in this regime .     with dipoles polarised in the @xmath0-plane at an angle of @xmath1 to the @xmath2-axis .",
    "[ f : schematic ] , width=336 ]    in this paper we present a general treatment of a flattened dipolar bec .",
    "we focus on the situation where the confinement is harmonic along one direction , with free in - planar motion .",
    "we allow for the dipoles to be tilted at an arbitrary angle into the plane .",
    "we formulate mean field equations for the condensate and quasiparticle excitations .",
    "we observe that the condensate possesses a symmetry , whereby its properties are determined by a single effective interaction parameter accounting for the contact interaction , ddi , and the effect of tilt .",
    "additionally , we show that the part of the excitation spectrum that determines the onset of rotons and collapse instability possesses another rigorous symmetry . this motivates the introduction of a second effective interaction parameter , and allows us to provide a universal description of the stability boundary .",
    "we numerically solve the exact mean field equations for condensate and quasiparticles .",
    "this allows us to obtain benchmark results for the universal properties of the condensate and the stability phase diagram , which are provided as data files with this paper .",
    "we then turn to considering approximate descriptions of the system which involve a non - trivial reduction of the system to a 2d problem by assigning a specified profile for the condensate and quasiparticle profiles in the confined direction . in detail",
    "we consider the standard quasi-2d approximation , a gaussian ( i.e.  _ single mode _ ) and two - mode variational ansatz , and a thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation .",

    "we validate the accuracy of these approximations by considering both condensate properties and the quasiparticle excitation spectrum .",
    "the best approximation is shown to be dependent on the strength of the interactions , and importantly that the widely used quasi-2d approximation is inaccurate except for very weak interactions where dipolar effects are small .",
    "the detailed understanding of the uniform planar case provided in this paper will underpin future work on tractable calculations of fully 3d trapped dipolar condensates without requiring cylindrical symmetry .",
    "this theory could be used to model the 3d trapped system with tight axial confinement and weaker in - plane trapping , by taking a wave function ansatz of the form @xmath177 where @xmath21 depends on @xmath44 via the areal density @xmath178 [ see eq .  ] . with in - plane trapping , the radial fourier transform of the density",
    "has a finite spread in @xmath179 [ c.f .  the delta function in eq .   for uniform in - plane density ]",
    "the gpe then has two interaction terms , a contact term proportional to @xmath180 locally [ see eq .  ] and a long - range term depending on @xmath178 everywhere .",
    "this long - range term has been discussed in the context of the quasi-2d approximation in ref .",
    "@xcite , and can be important in weakly anisotropic traps ( e.g.  @xmath181 , with @xmath182 and @xmath183 the radial trap frequencies ) where it gives rise to density oscillating ground states @xcite . for higher aspect ratio traps",
    "the radial density varies more slowly , and the long - range term becomes less significant .",
    "stability of dipolar becs has been of significant experimental interest @xcite , and while dipole tilt is an easily accessed control parameter in experiments , accurate theory has been limited to situations of untilted dipoles ( e.g.  see @xcite ) where the system has cylindrical symmetry .",
    "our universal stability results fully quantify the role of tilt and present an opportunity for validation in current experiments . with radial trapping",
    ", the density changes with the interactions , notably the density will tend to decrease as the interactions increase because the condensate radially spreads out .",
    "the instability condition will occur when the maximum value of @xmath21 reaches the critical value predicted in the uniform case , although there will be corrections due to the effect of the radial trapping on the quasi - particle excitations .",
    "finally , we note that our work can be also extended down a number of other avenues , e.g. , as the basis of descriptions for local collapse @xcite and condensate dynamics ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the calculation of static @xcite and dynamic correlation functions , and finite temperature formalism for a trapped partially condensed dipolar condensate @xcite .",

    "we substitute @xmath15 into eq .  .",
    "the fourier transform of the condensate density is @xmath184 so the interaction term gives @xmath185 using where @xmath21 is defined by . since the condensate is uniform in the plane , only the @xmath2 kinetic energy contributes which leads to .",
