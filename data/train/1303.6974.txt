    "<S> the spatial mode is cleaned using a single mode fibre and no active elements are used after the fibre . </S>",
    "<S> we collimate the light beam using an aspheric lens ( new focus 5724-h - b ) aligned such that the beam waist is at the position of the detector .    in order to simultaneously measure the beam position @xmath68 and the incident state of polarization </S>",
    "<S> , we employ a dielectric mirror ( layertec 103210 ) as a non - polarizing beam splitter at an angle of incidence of @xmath69 . the reflected and transmitted states of polarization </S>",
    "<S> coincide within experimental accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the beam centroid @xmath70 and stokes parameter @xmath71 are calculated from the digitized photo currents . </S>",
    "<S> we can measure the calibration factor @xmath72 in - situ by translating the quadrant detector using a micrometre stage .    since the signal is periodic with the modulation frequency @xmath73 , we can filter technical noise in a post - processing stage . to this end , the discrete fourier transform is computed and only spectral components with frequencies equal to @xmath74 and higher harmonics thereof are passed .    </S>",
    "<S> we identify @xmath75 and @xmath76 with the circular states of polarization @xmath77 and @xmath22 respectively . for both states , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the mean of all corresponding beam positions @xmath78 and the helicity - dependent displacement @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> an extensive characterization of statistical and systematic errors revealed that the observed position of the light beam depends slightly on the state of polarization even if no sample is present in the beam path . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of this spurious beam shift is typically much smaller than the phenomenon , we intend to study . in the supplemental material , we discuss that this amounts to a small offset ( 60  nm ) on the raw data points @xmath80 , independent from the action of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the shift measurements @xmath81 reported here are corrected with respect to the raw data .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate beam shifts in two different configurations . </S>",
    "<S> first , we measure the displacement @xmath82 of the total transmitted energy density distribution @xmath83 when switching the incident state of polarization from @xmath77 to @xmath22 ( figure  [ fig : shiftdata](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , we employ an additional polarization analyzer in front of the detector and observe the shift @xmath84 of the energy density @xmath85 of the vertically polarized field component solely ( figure  [ fig : shiftdata](b ) ) . these variants of the experiment coincide for polarizers with perfect extinction ratios but can differ significantly for real - world polarizers with minor deficiencies .    </S>",
    "<S> the beam shift observed in the latter case increases proportionally to the tangent of the tilting angle , exceeding one wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> this characteristic `` @xmath56''-behaviour ( and `` real - world - polarizer '' modification thereof ) is unique to the geometric spin hall effect of light . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> , the measurement agrees well with theoretical predictions using our phenomenological model .    ) for two different cases and compare this with the geometric shel studied in this work . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) and ( b ) geometric shel @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the same configuration as in figure  [ fig : shiftdata ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) geometric shel as predicted for an ideal polarizing interface . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) conventional shel occurring at an air - glass interface ( , ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) conventional shel expected for the entrance face of our submerged polarizer ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) . ]    to the best of our knowledge , this is the first direct measurement of this intriguing phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric spin hall effect of light should not be confused with the conventional shel or imbert - fedorov shift . </S>",
    "<S> the latter occurs at a physical interface and , while such interfaces are present in our experimental setup , they can only give rise to beam shifts significantly smaller than the observed effect . </S>",
    "<S> in figure  [ fig : if ] , we compare our results to the imbert - fedorov shift , which could occur at the polarizer substrate , for a set of realistic parameters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this illustrates that the beam shifts measured in this work constitute a novel spin hall effect of light , virtually independent from surface effects .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the geometric spin hall effect of light experimentally by propagating a circularly polarized laser beam across a suitable polarizing interface . </S>",
    "<S> the centre of mass of the transmitted light field was found to be displaced with respect to position of the incident beam as predicted by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> while a gaussian light beam itself is invariant with respect to rotation around its axis of propagation , the geometry induced by the tilted polarizer , breaks this symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting displacement can be interpreted as a spin - to - orbit coupling characteristic for spin hall effects of light . </S>"
