    "recently there has been a great deal of interest in building models in which supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the observable particles through renormalizable interactions @xcite .",
    "a common feature of these models is that breaking occurs in the masses of `` messenger '' fields in the form m = m_susy + m , where @xmath0 is a supersymmetric mass term , and @xmath1 breaks . in most models of this kind constructed to date @xmath2 , and",
    "so the messenger threshold is approximately .",
    "integrating out the messenger fields gives rise to breaking in the low - energy effective lagrangian below the scale @xmath3 .",
    "a large amount of work has already been done on the calculation of the breaking effects from various types of interactions @xcite .",
    "in it was shown how to compute the leading low - energy breaking effects in a large class of models using only one - loop renormalization group ( rg ) equations and tree - level matching , while direct calculations of the same quantities require the evaluation of 1- and 2-loop graphs .",
    "the starting point of is the observation that since the messenger threshold is approximately , one can use a formalism where all couplings and masses are treated as superfields , and the susy breaking terms correspond to non - zero @xmath4-dependent spurion components of the couplings . in this framework , it is not hard to see that leading - log effects that are determined by the rg in the susy limit are related to _",
    "finite _ susy - breaking effects .",
    "for example , the rg can be used to compute corrections of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is a threshold mass .",
    "if @xmath3 is a superfield , then this contribution has a susy - breaking component .",
    "m |_^2|^2 = , which contains a loop factor , but no logarithm .",
    "effects of this type therefore correspond to finite loop effects that are not related to an rg calculation in components .",
    "a simple power - counting argument can be used to show that in gauge - mediated models the leading susy - breaking terms in the low - energy effective lagrangian arise from this sort of threshold dependence in the dimensionless couplings .",
    "this allows one to compute 1- and 2- loop susy breaking effects using the 1-loop rg equations and tree - level matching , analytically continued into superspace . in this technique",
    "was used to reproduce known results in a much simpler way , and also to derive new phenomenologically interesting results that would be much more difficult to compute directly .    in this paper , we extend the analysis of to higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "one motivation for this is to define an unambiguous procedure to perform the analytic continuation into superfield beyond one loop .",
    "we show that the gauge coupling is naturally extended to a real superfield that is not the sum of a chiral and an antichiral superfield .",
    "the @xmath6 component of the real gauge superfield plays a crucial role in reproducing the correct behavior of perturbation theory .",
    "another motivation for this is to obtain new results of interest for testing models in the literature . in particular , we are able to compute gaugino , squark , and slepton masses in gauge - mediated models at the next - to - leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "our result corresponds to an explicit calculation of 2- and 3-loop feynman diagrams .",
    "one of our results is that the gaugino masses in gauge - mediated models are `` screened '' from corrections from the susy - breaking sector up to 4 loops .",
    "this implies that the gauge - mediation relations are preserved up to corrections of order @xmath7 even if the susy - breaking ( or messenger ) sector is strongly coupled .",
    "we also compute other interesting effects , like the gaugino masses in  mediator \" models  @xcite , the gauge - mediated effective potential induced along classically flat directions , both for @xmath8 flat directions ( 2 loops ) as well as for the scalar partner of the axion ( 3 loops ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a definition of renormalized coupling constants that can be viewed as superfield spurions to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we use as examples specific theories that allow simple regulators . in section 3",
    ", we discuss this prescription in the case in which the theory is regulated using dimensional reduction .",
    "we also show that extending the couplings to superfields automatically selects the so - called @xmath9 scheme for the soft terms . in section 4 ,",
    "we use our technique to prove the gaugino screening result mentioned above , and compute gluino , squark , and slepton masses in gauge mediation at the nlo .",
    "we also extend our results to @xmath8-term breaking of susy , and derive the gaugino mass in  mediator \" models . in section 5 ,",
    "we compute some other interesting susy - breaking effects in gauge - mediated theories .",
    "section 6 summarizes our main results and contains our conclusions .",
    "the main tool of our approach is the use of renormalization schemes in which the renormalized coupling constants can be treated as superfields .",
    "much of our discussion can be viewed as a restatement of the insights of shifman and vainshtein  @xcite in the framework of renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "however , we will generalize the method to include breaking effects .",
    "for gaugino masses and @xmath10 terms , this was first done in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will simultaneously describe the running of the scalar masses . for related studies , see also ref .",
    "@xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we consider a simple example that illustrates many of the main ideas we will use in more complicated theories .",
    "we consider a massless wess  zumino model with bare lagrangian _ 0 = d^4 _ 0 ^+ ( d^2 ^3 + ) , and higher - derivative regulator terms  @xcite _ reg = d^4 _ 0 ^ .",
    "we can incorporate soft susy breaking by extending the bare couplings @xmath11 and @xmath12 to be @xmath4-dependent ( but @xmath13-independent ) superfields . to be @xmath13-independent",
    "does not violate susy , since it amounts to imposing the constraint @xmath14 . ]",
    "( @xmath11 is a superpotential coupling , and is not renormalized . )",
    "we have regulated the theory in a manner , so we can treat the bare couplings as superfields even at the quantum level .    because the theory is regulated in a way that preserves susy ( including the spurious susy acting on the couplings ) , the divergences that appear order - by - order in perturbation theory can be absorbed by counterterms .",
    "that is , we can write _ 0 = ( ) + ( , ( ) , / ) , where @xmath15 is the matter wavefunction counterterm . because the relation between the bare and renormalized couplings preserves susy",
    ", we see that the renormalized couplings can also be viewed as susy spurions .",
    "more specifically , we can define the counterterms by computing supergraphs with renormalized couplings in the vertices and propagators and choosing the counterterms to cancel the divergences . in the susy limit where there is no @xmath4 dependence in @xmath12 and @xmath11 , the counterterms have the form @xcite = d^4 c(||^2 / ^3 ( ) , ||/ ) ^ , where the form of the function @xmath16 follows from the fact that theory depends trivially on the overall normalization of the fields .    in the presence of soft susy breaking , the renormalized couplings @xmath17 and @xmath11 will also depend on @xmath4 , and there are new terms in the feynman rules involving supercovariant derivatives acting on the couplings @xmath17 and @xmath11 . however , it is easy to see that such terms can be ignored for purposes of computing the counterterms  @xcite . because our regulator preserves the spurion susy even in the presence of soft susy breaking , we know that the counterterms can still be chosen to be superfield functions of @xmath11 and @xmath17 . but local superspace counterterms involving supercovariant derivatives of @xmath11 and @xmath17 are forbidden simply by dimensional analysis .",
    "we conclude that even in the presence of soft susy breaking , the counterterms are still given by .",
    "note what has happened here : the renormalization of the theory with soft susy breaking is completely determined by a _",
    "_ calculation .",
    "this is the advantage of treating the bare and renormalized couplings as superfields .",
    "the fact that the theory depends in a trivial way on the scale of the fields can be expressed more formally by noting that the the bare lagrangian is invariant under e^a , _ 0 e^-(a + a^ ) _ 0 , e^-3a , where @xmath10 is a @xmath4-dependent ( but @xmath13-independent ) chiral superfield .",
    "the fact that the relation between the bare and renormalized parameters preserves this feature can be expressed by stating that the renormalized parameter @xmath17 transforms the same way as @xmath12 : e^-(a + a^ ) .",
    "if we view this as a @xmath18 `` gauge '' transformation , then @xmath19 ( and @xmath20 ) transform as a gauge field .",
    "this point of view will be extremely useful to us later .",
    "the relation between the bare and renormalized quantities determined by _ 0 = ( ) , determines the rg flow of the theory from @xmath21 .",
    "this gives = - c(||^2 / ^3 , ||/ ) ( ||^3 / ^3 ) .",
    "the @xmath22 component of @xmath23 is just the anomalous dimension .",
    "the renormalized soft scalar mass @xmath24 is defined by writing = z , where @xmath25 is the renormalized wavefunction factor . the rg equation for the soft mass",
    "is determined by the @xmath6 component of : = - .",
    "( ||^2 / ^3 ) |_^2|^2 = -(||^2 / z^3 ) .",
    "this formula is valid to all orders in perturbation theory . at the 1-loop level",
    "= - , and we recover the familiar result = |^2 m^2 , where @xmath26 is the running coupling constant . also gives the rg equation for @xmath10 terms if we add a non - vanishing @xmath27 component to @xmath28 .",
    "in the following , we will generalize the procedure followed in this section to general renormalizable susy theories with soft susy breaking .",
    "the idea is to include soft susy breaking by extending the bare couplings @xmath29 to @xmath4-dependent superfields .",
    "as long as the theory is regulated in a manner , the bare couplings can be viewed as spurion superfields even at the quantum level .",
    "we then define renormalized couplings @xmath30 related to the bare couplings by a superfield relation k_0 = g(k ( ) , / ) .",
    "the renormalization of the couplings in the susy limit then determines the renormalization of the soft susy breaking terms as long as the relation does not involve supercovariant derivatives acting on @xmath30 .",
    "but in a vast class of theories , this is guaranteed by simple power counting and symmetry arguments .",
    "therefore determines the complete rg flow of all soft susy breaking parameters . in the remainder of this section , we explain how to carry out these steps for gauge theories , which present additional subtleties .",
    "we begin with susy qed , a @xmath18 gauge theory with matter fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 with charges @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "this theory can be regulated in a completely manner using a combination of pauli  villars fields to regulate matter loops and a higher - derivative regulator for the gauge fields .",
    "the bare lagrangian can be written as @xmath35 , where _ 0 & = d^4 _ 0 ( ^e^v +    & + d^2 s_0 w^w_+ , contains the `` physical '' couplings , and _ reg & = d^4 _ 0 ( ^e^v + |^e^-v | ) + & + d^2 _ | + + & + d^2 w^ w_+ , contains the regulator terms . here ,",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are pauli  villars fields ( odd - statistics chiral superfields ) and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are cutoffs for the matter and gauge fields , respectively .",
    "we will take the cutoffs to infinity with @xmath40 , so there is effectively a single cutoff .",
    "note that the bare wavefunction factor @xmath12 appears both in front of the matter fields and the pauli  villars fields .",
    "this is necessary to regularize @xmath12-dependent subdivergences that occur at two loops and beyond . for reference ,",
    "the components of @xmath41 are given by s_0 = - - ^2 , where @xmath42 is the ( bare ) vacuum angle and @xmath43 is the bare gaugino mass .",
    "we incorporate explicit soft susy breaking by allowing the bare coupling @xmath41 and @xmath12 to be superfields with nonzero @xmath4 components . just as in the wess  zumino model",
    ", the fact that the regulator preserves susy means that the bare couplings can be viewed as superfields at the quantum level , and we can renormalize the theory by adding counterterms that are local ( in superspace ) and gauge invariant .",
    "we therefore define renormalized superfield couplings @xmath44 and @xmath17 by s_0 = s + s , _ 0 = + , where the counterterms @xmath45 and @xmath15 are superfield functions of @xmath44 and @xmath17 determined order - by - order in perturbation theory to cancel the ultraviolet divergences .    for @xmath17 we can proceed exactly as in the wess  zumino model discussed above , but we immediately encounter difficulties when we try to renormalize the gauge coupling as a superfield . one way to see the problem is that the only manifestly gauge - invariant operator that can act as a gauge counterterm is = d^2 s w^w_+ however , the result of a supergraph calculation is necessarily a @xmath46 integral . at one loop ,",
    "this is not a problem because the one - loop gauge diagrams are independent of all couplings ( since the gauge coupling is in front of the kinetic term ) , and the counterterm can be proportional to d^4 ( d^v w_+ ) = d^2 w^w_+ however , beyond one loop , the coefficient of the counterterm depends on the superfield couplings , and the counterterm can not be written as @xmath46 integral .",
    "this argument can be sharpened by using the fact that the counterterm @xmath47 is a _",
    "chiral _ superfield .",
    "because of this , @xmath47 must be a holomorphic function of @xmath44 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath48 , independent of @xmath49 as well as @xmath17 .",
    "we therefore have s = f ( s , , ) , where @xmath50 is a holomorphic function .",
    "now , the divergence in the gauge coupling @xmath51 is independent of the vacuum angle @xmath52 to all orders in perturbation theory , since @xmath53 is a total derivative , and therefore irrelevant in perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , 0 = = - . since @xmath50 is a holomorphic function , the only possibility is that @xmath54 is independent of @xmath44 , which implies f(s ) = a + b s , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are independent of @xmath44 .",
    "we see that @xmath55 is the 1-loop contribution , and @xmath56 is identically zero ( since the zero coupling limit corresponds to @xmath57 ) .",
    "we conclude that there is no divergence in the vacuum polarization beyond one loop .",
    "is a power series in @xmath44 .",
    "this is important for non - abelian gauge theories , where we will see that the perturbation series is non - analytic in @xmath44 . ]",
    "if this argument is to be believed , the coupling @xmath44 satisfies the exact ( to all orders in perturbation theory ) rg equation = - .",
    "this appears paradoxical , since it is known that the @xmath58-function has a ( scheme - independent ) contribution at two loops .    to understand what is going on ,",
    "we compute the counterterm explicitly at one loop , keeping the couplings as superfields .",
    "the diagrams are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we obtain the contribution to the 1pi effective action _",
    "1pi = - d^4d^4 p v p^2 p_t v + , where @xmath59 is a transverse superspace projector , and ( p^2 ) & = + & = + .",
    "the 1pi effective action can therefore be made finite by adding the counterterm s = - , where @xmath48 is a renormalization scale .",
    "note that we can not choose @xmath45 to depend on the `` kinematic '' cutoff @xmath60 , the scale at which the pauli  villars regulator cuts off the ultraviolet modes , simply because this quantity is not a chiral superfield .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear that physical quantities depend on @xmath38 only through the combination @xmath60 , together with the bare parameters .",
    "this is the key to understanding the meaning of the renormalized coupling @xmath44 .",
    "more formally , we note that the bare lagrangian is invariant under & e^a , e^a | , e^a , e^a | , + _ 0 & e^-(a + a^ ) _ 0 , _ e^-2a _ , s_0 s_0 , where @xmath10 is a @xmath4-dependent ( but @xmath13-independent ) chiral superfield .",
    "because @xmath12 measures the scale of the fields in the regulated theory , we can choose the subtractions that defined the renormalized @xmath17 so that = _ 0 f(s_0 + s_0^ , |_| / _ 0 , |_g| , ) , which shows that we can assign the same transformation rule to @xmath17 as @xmath12 .",
    "in the next subsection . ] from we find that the renormalized @xmath61 transforms as s s - . just as in the case of the wess  zumino model , we have found a symmetry under which @xmath17 can be interpreted as a background @xmath62 gauge field .",
    "is just a reflection of the konishi anomaly @xcite , therefore we will refer to this symmetry as the ( renormalized ) `` anomalous @xmath62 '' symmetry.as a consequence of this symmetry , physical quantities can depend on @xmath44 only in the combination s + s^- = s_0 + s_0^+ .",
    "( the shows that this combination depends on the kinematic cutoff when expressed in terms of the bare parameters . )",
    "notice that @xmath63 , which is proportional to the vacuum angle , can not appear in any invariant , consistent with the fact that the vacuum angle is not physical in a theory with massless fermions .",
    "because of the symmetry defined by and , the relation between the bare and renormalized wavefunction factors has the form _ 0 = ( )",
    "f ( s + s^- , , ) .",
    "the rg flow of the theory is determined by @xmath64 . due to the loop factor multiplying @xmath19 in the above expression ,",
    "an @xmath65-loop effects are often related to @xmath66-loop effects .",
    "there are many examples of this in the literature , and we also obtain new results of this type in subsequent sections . because the correlation functions depend on @xmath44 only through , the relation between the coupling @xmath44 and a gauge coupling defined directly in terms of 1pi green s function is _ non - analytic _ in the couplings . as already observed in",
    ", this can resolve the apparent contradiction between a holomorphic coupling that runs at one loop and the conventional definition of the gauge coupling that runs at all loops .",
    "we now note that the quantity s + s^- that appears in is a good candidate for a _ real _ renormalized superfield coupling .",
    "@xmath67 is a finite quantity that parameterizes the couplings of the theory , and it does not have any unphysical dependence on the scale of the fields . also , the @xmath68 and @xmath27 components of @xmath69 give the correct rg equations for the gauge coupling and gaugino mass to 2-loops .",
    "( in fact , is identical in form to the famous equation of , but note our equation involves only renormalized quantities . ) in the next subsection , we will explain the relation between @xmath67 and a renormalized gauge coupling defined from the 1pi action , and address the meaning of the @xmath6 component of @xmath67 .",
    "we close our discussion of susy qed by remarking that there is a completely analogous @xmath62 symmetry with a well defined action on the _ bare _ couplings .",
    "the `` gauge transformation '' @xmath70 has an anomaly , and so the bare gauge coupling must also transform to compensate for the transformation . in our regulator , this can be seen from the fact that the pauli  villars fields transform under the symmetry , so the anomaly can be obtained as the matrix element of the pauli  villars mass term in a background gauge field .",
    "more generally , it is clear that any holomorphic regulator yields the anomaly , and the result is that the theory is invariant under the transformation e^a , _ 0 e^-(a + a^ ) _ 0 , s_0 s_0 - with the regulator lagrangian _ invariant_. this  bare \" or ",
    "wilsonian \" anomalous @xmath62 is also a very useful symmetry @xcite .",
    "we now give another definition of the renormalized gauge coupling , obtained directly from the 1pi effective action by subtraction at a euclidean momentum point .",
    "this corresponds more closely to the `` physical '' coupling that describes the momentum dependence of the effective charge .",
    "more to the point , this definition of the gauge coupling can be directly understood in terms of component calculations , allowing us to make contact between our formalism and conventional calculations .    in a component calculation , it is natural to define the renormalized gauge coupling and gaugino mass in terms of an appropriate 1pi correlation function at a euclidean kinematic point .",
    "we now show that a definition of this type gives rise to a real superfield @xmath69 whose lowest components are the gauge coupling and gaugino mass",
    ". consider the supersymmetric limit first . to define the renormalized gauge coupling we must consider the gauge invariant bilinears in @xmath71 in the 1pi action .",
    "since we include quantum effects we must focus on @xmath46 integrals . by a simple operator analysis one finds there",
    "exists just one independent term _",
    "1pi & = d^4 p d^4(p^2 ) w^ w_+ + + & = d^4 p d^2 ( p^2 ) w^w_+ + , where the last identity follows simply by integrating over half of superspace .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 can contain the contribution from the tree - level and loop contributions to the ordinary gauge kinetic term .",
    "we can therefore define the renormalized gauge coupling simply by subtracting at a euclidean momentum point : .",
    "( p^2 ) |_p^2 = -^2 .",
    "the role of the operator of in generating the all order @xmath58-function was already emphasized in .",
    "we can similarly define a renormalized wavefunction superfield by considering the terms in the 1pi action that contribute to the matter kinetic term _ 1pi = d^4 p d^4 ( p^2 ) + , and defining = .",

    "i.e. _ they are @xmath77 .",
    "these terms therefore do not contribute to the gauge kinetic term and gaugino mass term in the 1pi action .",
    "it therefore makes sense to define a renormalized superfield coupling by r ( ) .",

    "this simple exercise clarifies why the @xmath6 component of @xmath69 , although associated with a non - local operator , nonetheless enters into the rg flow equations of the softly broken theory .",
    "we now discuss the relation between the real superfield gauge coupling discussed here and the holomorphic gauge coupling described in the previous subsection .",
    "since both are perfectly valid parameterizations of the renormalized gauge coupling , we can express @xmath69 in terms of the holomorphic coupling @xmath44 and @xmath17 .",
    "the coupling @xmath69 is clearly invariant under the field rescaling , so r ( ) = f ( s ( ) + s^ ( ) - ( ) ) .",

    "the formal results that justify these calculations are easy to state in superspace if the soft susy breaking terms are parameterized by @xmath4-dependent terms in the couplings .",
    "if the theory is regulated in a manner , then susy is formally preserved if we regard the bare couplings as superfield spurions .",
    "our result is that there is a definition of the _ renormalized _ couplings that can be similarly grouped into supermultiplets .",

    "our results imply that the simple extension @xmath314 automatically picks out the so - called @xmath9 scheme . in practice",
    ", this result allows one to simply compute the susy breaking components of @xmath69 ( for example ) by computing the lowest component as a function of the bare couplings ( or couplings in an underlying renormalized theory ) .",
    "this is a calculation , but taking @xmath4-dependent components of the result determines the low - energy susy breaking parameters . for instance , we have shown that the 2-loop rg equations for soft terms in @xmath9 are directly derived from the supersymmetric @xmath58-functions and anomalous dimensions .    more remarkably , this approach can be used to relate leading - log effects computed using the renormalization group to finite effects , since the result of taking higher @xmath4 components of a logarithm gives effects that are not logarithmically enhanced : .",

    ", we can obtain finite susy breaking effects at high loop order from simple algebraic calculations .",
    "models with low - energy supersymmetry breaking mediated by perturbative interactions are the natural arena to apply our method .",
    "indeed , it is precisely in these theories that it makes more sense to worry also about subleading rg evolution : this is because the boundary conditions for soft terms are in principle calculable with comparable accuracy .",
    "our technique was used to compute a variety of effects at 2-loop order and beyond .",
    "we computed for the first time the complete subleading corrections to the gaugino masses ( 2-loop ) and scalar masses ( 3-loop ) in gauge - mediated models ; we showed how to compute the effective potential for susy flat directions lifted by gauge mediation ( 2- and 3-loop ) .",
    "we also proved that gaugino masses are screened from higher - loop corrections involving couplings in the messenger sector .",
    "therefore , in the standard gauge mediated scenario , gaugino masses are rather insensitive on details of the model . moreover",
    ", this result also shows that if the gaugino masses are not generated at one loop ( as in the standard case ) they will be generated only from the light matter fields , and will generally be too light .",
    "this shows that gauge mediation is the unique way to generate scalar and gaugino masses of the same order through loop effects .",
