    "the effect of static and/or time - dependent electric fields on superlattices has been the subject of much recent work .",
    "of particular interest is the possibility of terahertz emission caused by bloch oscillations.@xcite focus in the past has been mainly on the presence of static electric fields while neglecting the thz emission signal propagating in the superlattices .",
    "recently however , in order to interpret the experimental observation of peak shifts in the wannier - stark absorption lines of optically excited superlattices , a quasi - static model has been introduced where the generated thz electric field is treated adiabatically.@xcite dignam has shown , however , that this adiabatic treatment of the thz electric field is inadequate.@xcite the treatment can be regarded as roughly correct only with the proviso that the interband inverse dephasing time is greater than the thz field frequency . if this condition is not fulfilled it is then necessary to treat the static and time - dependent electric fields on an equal footing .",
    "@xcite    it is also known that the combined dc and ac electric fields can induce many interesting and novel phenomena in superlattices .",
    "these include the appearance of inverse bloch oscillators@xcite , absolute negative conductivity@xcite , negative absorption ( gain)@xcite , and fractional wannier - stark ladders@xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the absorption and wavepacket dynamics in optically excited semiconductor superlattices under the influence of dc - ac electric fields .",
    "it is found that the parameters from both the dc and ac electric fields play important roles in determining their coherent dynamics behavior .",
    "the absorption spectrum is determined by the ratio of the stark frequency @xmath1 to the thz field frequency @xmath2 . when this ratio is an integer @xmath0 , @xmath0 harmonics appear within the frequency interval @xmath1 , while if it is a fraction of the form @xmath3 the number of harmonics is @xmath4 , each being identified as part of the so called fractional ladder .",
    "it is the first time that this fractional structure is found in the frequency domain by taking into account the excitonic interaction . also , the excitonic together with fano interference on the asymmetric lineshape of the absorption is pointed out . on the other hand ,",
    "the extent and profile of an electron - hole wavepacket is mainly determined by the ratio of the stark frequency associated with the strength of the thz field , and its frequency .",
    "the excitonic interaction produces anisotropy in the wavepacket profile and reduces the dynamic localization effect .",
    "the coherent dynamics of an optically excited semiconductor superlattice ( sl ) driven by static and time - dependent electric fields can be described by the following semiconductor bloch equations@xcite    @xmath5p_{\\bf k}(t)-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[n_{e,{\\bf k}}+n_{h,{\\bf k}}-1 ] \\omega_{r,{\\bf k}}\\ ] ]    @xmath6 -\\gamma_t{n_{e,(h){\\bf k}}(t)},\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the interband polarization and @xmath8 the electron ( hole ) population density in the conduction ( valence ) band .",
    "the quantities @xmath9 are the renormalized electron and hole energies due to the coulomb interaction , with @xmath10 being the single - particle band energy .",
    "also , @xmath11 are the renormalized rabi frequencies , with @xmath12 the dipole moment and @xmath13 @xmath14  fs@xmath15 , the gaussian laser pulse profile .",
    "the relaxation time approximation has been assumed , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates , respectively .",
    "we want to obtain the spectrally - resolved absorption coefficient and coherent wavepacket dynamics for an optically excited sl driven by the combined dc - ac fields @xmath18 .",
    "the both components of the electric field are assumed to point along the same direction .    for simplicity , a one - dimensional tight - binding ( tb ) approximation has been adopted with the two miniband widths and gap energy being @xmath19 ( conduction ) , @xmath20 ( valence ) and @xmath21 respectively.@xcite this approximation neglects the in - plane continuum contribution to the absorption , whose consequence is discussed in the following .",
    "firstly , in the absence of excitonic interaction , the absorption @xmath22 is proportional to the 3-d joint density @xmath23 , which is the convolution product of the one dimensional joint density of states ( jdos ) @xmath24 and 2-d continuum jdos @xmath25 .",
    "the latter is a step function changing abruptly at @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 the one dimensional jdos @xmath24 looks like a trapezoid with the concave part in the middle , and it approximately extends between @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29 here is the combined miniband widths defined as @xmath30 . due to delayed kernel of @xmath31 in the above expression , the resulting @xmath23 begins to attain the finite value at @xmath32 . and becomes an approximate constant at @xmath33 and beyond . that is to say , that the behavior of @xmath25 at @xmath26 changes completely due to one - dimensional jdos .",
    "thus , the inclusion of the in - plane continuum contribution can influence the height of characteristic peaks .",
    "because jdos is always positive , it can not turn the gain - type lineshape to the resonance - type shape or vice versa .",
    "secondly , the contribution to the oscillator strength from the in - plane continuum is negligible in the range of terahertz radiation of experimental interest@xcite .",
    "thirdly , one also can regard the in - plane continuum as the source of the inhomogeneous broadening which was proposed by thomas and von plessen@xcite .",
    "this inhomegeneous broadening may smear some characteristics peaks appearing in our present numerical simulations .",
    "this tb approximation captures the qualitative features of the realistic superlattices , and can give a fairly good description of their response within the strong coupling regime.@xcite it has been used with success by many groups@xcite in the past . for the coulomb interaction",
    "we adopt the on - site model . in the absence of the external electric fields , the contact coloumb potential produces single bound states@xcite . in the dc - ac case , however , the situation changes significantly .",
    "for example , in the realm of the near resonance case of stark and ac field frequencies , unequal spacing@xcite between the wannier - stark ladders due to excitonic interaction can make the quasienergy of the system to present more than one bound floquet state .",
    "the number of bound floquet states is determined by how many distinct deviations between excitonic wannier - stark ladders and multiple ac field quantum .",
    "this kind of floquet bound states usually appears in the low wannier - stark ladder indices .",
    "this case of more than one bound floquet states has been discussed in great detail by liu and zhu clearly within the picture of dressed wannier - stark ladders@xcite .    because we assume a _ weak _ ultrashort laser pulse to excite the sl , instead of the perturbative expansion of semiconductor bloch equations in terms of the order of @xmath34 , we take into account the full contributions from interband polarization . the nonlinear effect facilitated by the coupling of @xmath35 with @xmath36 on the lineshape of the fractional ladders will be discussed in the following text .",
    "it is well known that the absorption coefficient can be expressed as @xmath37 $ ] , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 being the fourier - transformed quantities of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we discuss separately two cases of interest , in which the ratio of the stark frequency @xmath42 to the thz field frequency @xmath2 is _ ( a ) _ an integer @xmath0 , and _ ( b ) _ , an irreducible fraction @xmath43 .",
    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were numerically integrated in the accelerated @xmath44 basis , where the drift term can be eliminated .",
    "our results for the integer case @xmath45 thz are shown in fig.1 .",
    "figure 1(a ) is for the static case , while fig.1(b ) is for @xmath46 .",
    "the values of parameters used are : combined miniband width @xmath47 mev ; coulomb interaction strength @xmath4810 mev , comparable to miniband width ; dephasing rates @xmath49 th ; in the simulation of the coherent time evolution of the wavepackets , the central frequency of the ultrashort laser pulse @xmath50 is tuned to be in resonance with the energy - gap frequency @xmath51 .    the wannier - stark resonances are clearly identified in fig.1(a ) .",
    "the frequency spacings are not equal , however , due to the excitonic interaction@xcite . in fig.1(b )",
    "the spectrum appears more complex , showing a weak additional structure between any two main peaks .",
    "these weak structures exhibit either gain or absorption lineshapes , resulting from the nonlinear sum and difference frequency mixing of the dc and thz electric fields .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the ratio @xmath52 is a dominating factor in determining whether gain or absorption occurs .",
    "that is to say , changing the ratio @xmath52 may turn the resonance - type peaks into gain - type dips , or vice versa .",
    "the linewidth broadening of these structures also depends on the ratio @xmath52 .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the quasi - energy band @xcite of a dc - ac driven single - band tb system @xcite is @xmath53 , with @xmath54 . according to the generalized golden rule in the single - particle picture the transition rate @xmath55 from the valence",
    "dressed band to the conduction dressed band for every component @xmath44 , is proportional to @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "@xcite for every @xmath44 , the transition can be viewed as a two - level system ( tls ) with different energy spacing .",
    "these different energy spacings together with the @xmath44-_mixing _ effect of the excitonic interaction lead to the broadening of the resonance peaks and gain dips .",
    "of course , one can select the ratio @xmath52 to control the quasi - energy band widths , hence the broadening .",
    "another feature , apparent when comparing figs.1(a ) and 1(b ) , is the relative blueshift of the _ main _ resonance peaks in the latter .",
    "these shifts are not equal , as emphasized by the horizontal arrows .",
    "other integer cases such as @xmath0 @xmath57 were also calculated , yielding @xmath0 resonance - type peaks or gain - type splittings in every stark frequency interval @xmath1 . in order to save space , they will not be discussed here .",
    "distinct asymmetric lineshapes of the peaks appear both in dc / dc - ac field case in fig.1 .",
    "this asymmetry can be attributed to the fano resonance@xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the fano resonance in dc - biased semiconductor superlattices was made by whittaker@xcite , linder@xcite , glutsch , and bechstedt@xcite , and was experimentally observed by holfeld et al@xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the fano resonance is due to the coupling between the discrete and continuous excitonic states of the relative motion , mediated by the coulomb interactions@xcite .",
    "the fano resonance in dc - ac ( @xmath58 an integer ) driving superlattices were studied by liu and zhu@xcite .",
    "the resonance takes effect through the coupling between the discrete _ quasienergy _ excitons and sidebands of their continua .",
    "the other interesting case is when the ratio @xmath59 equals an irreducible fraction @xmath60 .",
    "figure 2 shows the spectrally - resolved absorption coefficient for the cases @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "here the same excitonic interaction strength and combined miniband width as in fig.1 are used . in all cases @xmath64 , and @xmath2 is fixed to be @xmath65 thz .",
    "surprisingly , the resonances appear at approximately the same frequencies in all three panels , although the stark frequency in the top and bottom panels differ by a factor of four . in order to guide the eyes ,",
    "dash - dot - dot vertical lines were drawn around these resonances .",
    "it can also be seen from the figure that some resonances split into two peaks , which can be understood in the following context .",
    "the beating frequency between the peaks in all panels is almost the same : @xmath66 .",
    "this frequency equals neither the stark frequency @xmath1 , which changes from panel to panel , nor the angular frequency of the ac field @xmath2 . as a matter of fact , the quasi - energy band of the hamiltonian driven by dc - ac electric fields with the ratio @xmath3 , is the underlying mechanism for the appearance of these peaks . within the one - electron and single - band approximations ,",
    "these quasi - energy bands are given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 gives the band dispersion .",
    "@xcite from the last term in the right hand side of eq.(3 ) it is evident that the quasi - energy band consists of @xmath69 subbands with equal energy spacing @xmath70 .",
    "the absorption spectrum reflects this energy gap through the generalized fermi golden rule described above , while the term @xmath68 is responsible for the broadening of the spectrum .",
    "the different values of @xmath1 taken in the three panels result in different values of @xmath68 , hence , different broadening . also , the inclusion of the coulomb interaction makes the positions of the peaks to not exactly match the @xmath71 rule . yet , since on the average there is one peak per @xmath71 frequency interval , the structures are termed excitonic fractional ladders .",
    "their _ temporal _ counterpart has been discussed recently in the time - resolved four - wave mixing spectrum @xcite .",
    "results in the absence of excitonic interaction are presented in fig.3 , where we used the same parameters as in fig.2 except that now @xmath72 .",
    "the fractional stark ladder of spacing @xmath71 can be clearly identified , with peaks distributed symmetrically about @xmath73 , matching the @xmath71 rule better than the excitonic case .",
    "these have been indicated by the vertical arrows in the upper panel of fig.2 .",
    "comparison of the fractional ladder lineshape in fig.2 and fig.3 reveals that the purely lorentzian lineshape of some peaks in fig.3 is absent in the corresponding peaks in fig.2 , where the excitonic interaction is taken into account .",
    "this demonstrates that the excitonic interaction together with the fano resonances destroys the symmetry and smears some resonance peaks . here",
    ", the fano interference with small parameter @xmath74 takes effect through the coupling of the discrete excitonic fractional ladders with the continuous sideband .",
    "it should be emphasized that the absorption signal depends also on the phase difference between the ultrashort laser pulse and the ac field .",
    "this important effect has been found recently by meier@xcite et al in an anisotropic 3-d superlattice .    when the exciting laser field becomes strong , the nonlinear effect due to the high order exciting laser field magnitude @xmath75 begins to take effect .",
    "the typical simulation of the effect is through the pump - probe configurations , where the weak probe laser field is delayed to time @xmath76 with respect to the strong pump field .",
    "then the different linear and nonlinear signals can be extracted@xcite .",
    "this nonlinear effect makes the clear - cut fractional ladder harmonics broadened , tending to merge with each other .",
    "this is ahown in fig.4 , where the ratio of the exciting laser amplitude has been indicated in the upper - right corner of the respective panels .",
    "here we only show the case of @xmath61 , and we use otherwise the same parameters as those in fig .",
    "3 , setting the time delay @xmath76 to @xmath77 femtoseconds .",
    "there is another interesting but subtle problem when the ratio @xmath59 is an irrational .",
    "numerical calculation can not identify the essential difference between the rational and irrational cases .",
    "physically , this difference will also be blurred by the scattering processes .",
    "we now turn to the coherent dynamic evolution of electron - hole wavepackets ( wp ) .",
    "results for a pure dc field have been previously reported by dignam and coworkers , where bloch oscillations are clearly demonstrated.@xcite meier et al studied relative motion in the exciton wavefunction in _ momentum space _ and found a dimensional crossover due to dynamic localization induced by a strong thz field.@xcite more recently hughes and citrin gave vivid pictures of the strongly anisotropic excitonic wp in optically excited semiconductor quantum wells driven by an in - plane thz field , through a time sequence of the wp snapshots.@xcite    the wp coherent evolution may be described through the squared modulus of the real space fourier transform of the interband polarization @xmath78 , giving the real space description of the probability density of finding an electron and hole separated by @xmath79 at time @xmath80.@xcite it should be noted that wavepackets can not directly be probed by experiments , although it is theoretically interesting . in optically excited semiconductors ,",
    "the center of mass quasi - momentum of the electron - hole is always zero@xcite , which makes the description of the behavior of the wavepackets in the center of mass difficult .    in order to elucidate the role the excitonic interaction plays on the profile of wavepackets , we first present results in the absence of this interaction .",
    "snapshots at various times are shown in fig.5 , where the stark and ac frequencies are chosen to have the same value @xmath81 thz ( @xmath82 fs ) , and @xmath83 is set close to the first root of the first order ordinary bessel function ( 3.832 ) .",
    "note that at all times the wp is symmetric about the position @xmath84 . with the elapse of time ,",
    "it first splits into two parts and subsequently into three parts at half @xmath85 , when the size of the wp acquires its largest value within a cycle .",
    "after @xmath86 , the size begins to reduce . due to the synchronous dynamic localization of electron and hole , at time @xmath87 , the size of the wp experiences the severe shrinkage shown in the last panel of fig.5 . at later times , the wp will undergo the same expanding and shrinking processes in every time cycle ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "this phenomenon demonstrates that dynamic localization has the ability to control the size of the wp .",
    "that is to say , that dynamic localization will make it impossible to find the electrons and holes simultaneously beyond a certain value of the relative coordinate . also ,",
    "comparison fig.5 and fig .",
    "6 shows that dynamic localization makes the value of @xmath88 larger at @xmath84 , demonstrating that it will enhance absorption .",
    "figure 6 illustrates the same case as that of fig.5 , except that we choose @xmath83 to be 4.5 .",
    "now the wp also splits into three parts at time @xmath89 .",
    "the most important difference , however , lies in that now the size of the wp does _ not _ experience shrinking towards the end of the cycle .",
    "in fact , the size of the wp grows steadily with time , until it disappears due to dissipation .",
    "we next turn the excitonic interaction on , with results showing a substantial change in the profile of the wp , as shown in fig.7 . here",
    "we use the same parameters as in fig.5 .",
    "the wp becomes strongly anisotropic .",
    "its height is reduced and although its extent still undergoes a shrinkage towards the end of the cycle , this shrinkage is less severe as compared with the non interacting case .",
    "the splitting structure can be viewed as the spatial interference@xcite induced by the coulombic re - scattering due to the oscillating motion of the photo - generated electron - hole driven by dc - ac fields .",
    "in summary , the spectrally - resolved absorption and real - time wavepackets of an optically excited semiconductor superlattice driven by combined parallel dc - ac electric fields are obtained by numerical integration of the semiconductor bloch equations .",
    "the ratio of dc field stark frequency @xmath1 to ac field frequency @xmath2 determines the characteristic peaks of the absorption spectrum . when the ratio is a fraction , we identify for the first time the fractional ladders in the energy domain by taking into account the excitonic interaction , which we take as comparable to the miniband width . for the integer @xmath0 case we find @xmath0 features within the frequency interval @xmath1 , corresponding to gain and resonant absorption .",
    "the effect of the dc - ac field on the size and profile of the wp shows that , as expected , dynamic localization vigorously curtails the elongation of the wp within one cycle makes its evolution behavior to be of breathing mode .",
    "the excitonic interaction destroys the wp symmetry about its center and softens the dynamic localization of the wp within one time cycle .",
