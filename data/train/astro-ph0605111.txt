    "follow - up observations of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have shown that the initial prompt emission is followed by an afterglow , i.e. a fading x - ray , optical and radio source that can last up to several months after the @xmath2-ray flash . according to the currently accepted theory ,",
    "the afterglow arises when the burst ejecta interact with the surrounding medium and produce a shock , which propagates in the medium and heats the electrons .",
    "the latter , cooling down through synchrotron emission , produce the observed radiation .",
    "studies of afterglows can thus provide invaluable information on the central engine of grbs , on the circumburst medium and can possibly lead to the identification of different subclasses in the grb population .    until recently",
    ", most follow - up observations did not start until a few hours after the grb , when the afterglow had already faded significantly .",
    "this situation has changed with the launch of the _ swift _ mission , which provides both a rapid alert of grb triggers to ground - based observers , and rapid ( within @xmath3  min after the @xmath2-ray trigger ) x - ray and optical / uv follow - up observations of the burst afterglow .",
    "the temporal behavior of the grb emission at this early epoch has been thus unveiled .",
    "several interesting features have been discovered ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for detailed discussions ) : i ) the typical behavior of the x - ray emission has been shown to consist of an initial steep decay , followed by a shallow one about 100 - 1000s after the trigger ; ii ) a second change of the decay slope usually occurs about 10 ks later ; iii ) in some cases , a further steepening of the slope , typical signature of collimated outflow , is observed 100 - 1000 ks after the trigger .",
    "furthermore , in a few events the initial fast decay was unobserved , and in others x - ray flares have been detected , superimposed on this `` template '' time behavior ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as for the optical emission , it has been observed that in many cases the optical / uv emission is much lower than expected ( @xcite ) , suggesting some cause of suppression of the flux in the optical band .    even in past years",
    ", irregular temporal features have been occasionally seen in various bursts ( see @xcite and references therein ) : just to mention some examples these include a rebrightening in grb  970508 , grb  021004 and step - like features in grb  030309 .",
    "other similar peculiarities have been observed in several cases ( e.g. grb  970228 , grb  980326 , grb  000203c ) .",
    "various interpretations have been proposed , mainly in terms of `` refreshed shocks '' ( @xcite ) , supernova components ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , dust echoes ( @xcite ) or microlensing ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , signatures detected by _",
    "swift _ in the grb lightcurve at earlier times may provide diagnostic about the nature of the injection and eventually probe whether the energy is released impulsively during the event or more continuously during the immediate post - burst epoch ( see e.g. @xcite ) , eventually with different lorentz factors of the ejecta ( @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we report the properties of the _ swift _  grb  050712 , and discuss them in the context of the current models and scenarios of grbs . in   [ xray ] , we describe the analysis of @xmath2 and x - ray data , while the analysis of uvot data is shown in   [ opt ] .",
    "the possible interpretations are examined in   [ disc ] and we finally summarize our conclusions in   [ conc ] .",
    "the _ swift _ observatory ( @xcite ) carries three science instruments : the burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) , which locates grbs with 3 accuracy , the narrow field x - ray telescope ( xrt , @xcite ) and the ultra - violet optical telescope ( uvot , @xcite ) .",
    "when bat detects a grb trigger , _ swift _ slews towards the source position within a few tens of seconds .",
    "grb  050712 triggered the bat instrument at 14:00:28 ut on july 12 , 2005 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the refined bat position is ra=@xmath4 , dec=@xmath5 with a position uncertainty of 1.7 ( 90% c.l . ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath2-ray band emission started 8s before the bat trigger time and the lightcurve shows a very broad peak ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) , with a peak count rate of @xmath1500 counts / s ( @xcite ) .    from the analysis of the bat data ( 15 - 350  kev energy band ) we found that the grb duration is t@xmath6s .",
    "for the spectral analysis , we report results obtained in the 15 - 150 kev band , because the mask weighted technique has been used to subtract the background . above 150 kev ,",
    "the coded mask becomes transparent and the mask - weighting technique is no longer effective .",
    "a single powerlaw provides a satisfactory fit ( @xmath7 for 57 d.o.f . ) of the bat spectrum , with an energy index of @xmath8 ( hereafter we shall assume the convention @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the decay slope and @xmath11 is the spectral index ; errors are reported at 1@xmath12 confidence level , unless specified otherwise ) .",

    "this position is within 62  of the initial bat position ( @xcite ) .",
    "this source subsequently faded , indicating that it was the x - ray counterpart of grb  050712 .",
    "xrt data used in this paper were initially taken in windowed timing ( wt ) mode ( @xcite ) , and subsequently in photon counting ( pc ) mode .",
    "the xrt data were reduced with the _ xrtpipeline _ software , version 0.9.9 .",
    "source and background photons of the wt mode data were selected by _",
    "xselect _ version 2.3 in a box with a length of 34.5 pixels ( = @xmath20 ) .",
    "the source photons of the pc mode data were selected in a circular region with a radius of r=47@xmath21 and the background photons in a nearby circular region with a radius of r=96@xmath21 .",
    "for the spectral data events with grades 0 - 2 and 0 - 12 were selected for the wt and pc mode data , respectively .",
    "for the pc mode data of the first orbit , because of pileup , the inner 5@xmath21 of the circle had to be discarded from the spectral analysis .",
    "the spectral data were re - binned by _ grppha _ 3.0.0 with 20 photons per bin .",
    "the spectra were analyzed using xspec version 12.2.1 .",
    "the auxiliary response files were created with _",
    "xrtmkarf _ and the standard response matrices swxwt0to2_20010101v007.rmf and swxpc0to12_20010101v007.rmf were used for the wt and the pc data respectively .",
    "the background - subtracted x - ray light curve in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev energy range was constructed by using the eso munich image data analysis software midas ( version 04sep ) .",
    "the binning was dynamically performed . at the beginning of the observations",
    "the binning was set to 50 photons per bin while at later times it was reduced to 10 photons per bin . a pileup correction for the pc mode data of the first orbit",
    "was applied as described in @xcite .",
    "count rates were converted into fluxes by determining the energy conversion factors for the pc and wt mode data as described by @xcite .    in order to search for spectral variability through out the observations we also derived the temporal behaviour of the hardness ratio .",
    "the hardness ratio has been calculated as hr = ( h - s)/(h+s ) where s and h are the number of counts in the 0.3 - 1.0 kev and 1.0 - 10.0 kev bands , respectively .",
    "figures  [ f2 ] and [ f3 ] show the x - ray lightcurve in the 0.3 - 10 kev energy band .",
    "the presence of three flares is evident , about 210s , 240s and 480s after the bat trigger .",
    "we also tested if the flares were visible in the late bat data .",
    "a visual inspection of the lightcurve reported in figure  [ f1 ] shows no obvious flare at these epoch .",
    "thus we looked at the data with a statistical approach .",
    "we set up a script to go through the phase space of energy bands and time intervals ( from @xmath22s to @xmath23s ) and made a set of 160 sky images , each of which we checked for flux at the source position .",
    "out of the 160 trials we see 58 cases with a significance of @xmath24 , far more than we expect from statistics .",
    "the most significant single trial was in the interval 25 - 50  kev , @xmath25s , at @xmath26 .",
    "however , if we look at the whole time interval and energy band ( @xmath27  s and 15 - 150 kev ) , the significance is only 2.0 sigma ( @xmath27  s in 25 - 50 kev gives @xmath28 ) .",
    "therefore , the evidence for this peak is larger in the soft band with respect to the total one . to make sure that there was no systematic bias , we did a similar test using a time interval before the burst and we found a distribution consistent with statistics .    between the second and third flares ,",
    "the lightcurve exhibits a plateau which lasts approximately for 50s , followed by a steep decline and then by a fast rise . after the third flare , which lasts for about 200s",
    ", there is a gap in the coverage due to the _ swift _ orbit , thus we can not constrain the behaviour of the x - ray lightcurve during this interval . however , an extrapolation of the later x - ray lightcurve backward reconnects to the late points of the flare , showing a shallow decline after @xmath29s and a possible break at later times , i.e. around 70  ks after the trigger ( see further ) .",
    "we note that the 0.3 - 10 kev fluence in the first 1000s ( i.e. in the interval including the three flares ) is @xmath30 erg @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath31 of the fluence detected in the 15 - 150 kev band during the prompt emission phase .",
    "we fitted the x - ray spectra taken at different time intervals with an absorbed powerlaw .",
    "best fit values of column density and energy spectral index are summarized in table  [ tab_spec ] , while fig.[f3 ] shows the evolution of the hardness ratio .",
    "spectra taken before , during and after the flares are shown in fig .  [ f4 ] .",
    "as we can see , the x - ray data indicate a clear spectral evolution throughout the first 1000s , with a change in the spectral index .",
    "in particular , after the first @xmath1200 - 300s the spectrum starts softening monotonically , while , after the second peak , it changes abruptly and the energy index increases up to a value consistent with that observed in the late phases of the afterglow .",
    "we also detect a photoelectric absorption in excess of the galactic column density , @xmath32@xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "further discussion on this issue is postponed to  [ disc_3 ] .",
    "_ swift _ uvot detected the optical counterpart of grb  050712 in the v band , @xmath1200s after the bat trigger ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source was fading away , but has been positively detected by _ swift _",
    "uvot until 15000s after the trigger .",
    "the log of optical observations is reported in table  [ tab_obs ] .",
    "the analysis of the _ swift _ uvot optical images was performed by correcting for attitude drifts with an in - house software and summing up all the exposures in the indicated time interval with _",
    "uvotimsum _ , part of swift software version 2.0 .",
    "source counts were extracted in a circular region of 3  radius , while the background was extracted in a circular region of 20  radius . in both cases , the packages _",
    "ds9 _ version 4.0 and _ ximage _ version 4.3.1 was used to create the region files and extract counts , respectively .",
    "counts were converted in magnitudes by using the latest caldb zero - points , _ _",
    "swuphot20041120v102.fits__. uvot magnitudes can be equated to the johnson standard .",
    "+ the v band lightcurve is shown in fig .",
    "a positive detection has also been obtained in the u band by uvot ( see table  [ tab_obs ] for values ) .",
    "this allows us to put an upper limit on the redshift of grb  050712 . for redshift @xmath33",
    ", the intervening extragalactic hydrogen would produce a u - v colour index of @xmath34 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and we would not expect an optical detection in the u band at all for redshift larger than this value . rather , our data suggest that magnitudes in the v and u band are equal within errors",
    ". we can therefore take @xmath33 as upper limit for the redshift of grb050712 .    for completeness",
    ", we also list two successful ground - based optical follow up observations which were triggered by the prompt _ swift _ localization and led to the detection of the optical afterglow in the r band 8 hours and 14 hours after the burst trigger ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as discussed in   [ xray ] , the x - ray lightcurve of grb  050712 exhibits at least three flares , at about 210s , 240s and 480s after the bat trigger .",
    "these features have been observed with _",
    "swift _ in several other grbs ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and seem to be characteristic of the x - ray emission detected at early times .    in principle , the occurrence of flares can be associated with several mechanism such as : reverse shock propagation , presence of high density clouds surrounding the progenitor , or grb emission collimated in a multicomponent outflow with variable amount of energy per solid angle , as in models involving `` structured jets '' or `` patchy shells '' ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the majority of these models , which ultimately account for different ways in which the ejecta interact with the circumbust medium , can not account for the rapid onset and decline of the x - ray flare observed in several grbs by _ swift _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative scenario for these features is that the `` inner engine '' of the grbs does not switch off at the end of the main high - energy event but it still emits shells , which continue to collide and produce radiation .",
    "following @xcite , in this case the peak energy of the flare emission , @xmath35 , scales as :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the luminosity , @xmath38 is the lorentz factor and @xmath39 is the variability time scale of the flare .",
    "the observed x - ray peaks have luminosity lower than that of the main event , and their fluctuations take place on a large time scale .",
    "also , it is expected that the environment tends to be cleaner so that @xmath38 may be larger . therefore",
    ", late `` internal shocks '' can give rise to ( x - ray ) bursts which are softer as compared with the prompt ( @xmath2-ray ) emission .",
    "the high lorentz factor of the shells naturally explains fast variations of the flux , in terms of a pure propagation effect .",
    "let us assume that the shells , moving at a dimensionless velocity @xmath11 , emit a photon at the time @xmath40 at a certain distance from the centre of the explosion @xmath41 and a second photon at the time @xmath42 and position @xmath43 ) .",
    "the time @xmath44 is measured in the earth observer s reference frame , and the distance between this observer and the shell location is d. this first photon arrives at the observer at the time @xmath45 , while the second one arrives at a time @xmath46 where @xmath47 . in turn ,",
    "the interval for the observer to receive the two photons is much reduced , i.e. @xmath48 .    in the case at hand , the 2nd flare flux ( extrapolated in the 0.3 - 150 kev band ) is @xmath49erg / s/@xmath50 , the lorentz factor should be as high as @xmath51 ( see  @xcite and reference therein ) and the time scale of variation is @xmath52s .",
    "the corresponding quantities during the prompt emission are @xmath53erg / s/@xmath50 , @xmath54 and @xmath110s . for such values ,",
    "equation [ eq1 ] predict a peak energy a factor @xmath55 lower than that in the prompt phase .",
    "a good measurement of the peak energy of the prompt emission of this burst is unavailable , but if we assume a standard value of @xmath56 kev ( preece et al .",
    "2000 ) , we can infer that the peak energy of the 2nd flare must be at @xmath57 kev , i.e. in the xrt band .    during the decay of flares produced by late `` internal shocks '' , the relationship between the spectral and decay indices is given by ( @xcite ) :    @xmath58    provided that the decay slope is computed by re - setting the time - zero point t@xmath59 at the time of the peak ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we note that several _ swift _",
    "bursts exhibit a rapid decay during the early phase of the observed x - ray emission ( first hundreds of seconds after the trigger ) , with spectral slope @xmath60 and decays slope @xmath61 respectively , in agreement with the predictions of eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] .    in the case of grb  050712",
    ", we found that the x - ray spectral evolution of the emission in the first 400s is in general agreement with this `` late internal shocks '' scenario . during this phase the x - ray spectrum of grb  050712 softens , with the energy index decreasing from -1.1 to -1.7",
    "this is reminiscent of the behavior of the prompt emission . for comparison ,",
    "the spectral index of the low energy part of the @xmath2-ray emission detected by bat is around -0.5 . assuming that the first two flares have a similar @xmath62s",
    ", we get @xmath63 and @xmath64 for their decay slopes .",
    "we also have @xmath65 ( see tab .  [ tab_spec ] ) for the spectral index of the first and second peak .",
    "so our results are in agreement with eq .",
    "also , we may speculate that the decay phase observed around @xmath1400s after the trigger might follow a further release of energy which is not observed as a `` flare '' since it is superimposed on that of the first peak . in this case",
    ", it would be difficult to fix @xmath66 properly .",
    "however , we find that taking @xmath67s gives a decay slope of @xmath68 , which again satisfies eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] ( since during this phase the spectral index is the same as before , i.e. @xmath65 ) .",
    "+ however , the situation may differ as far as the third x - ray flare , observed at @xmath69s , is concerned .",
    "first , if this peak were due to a further internal shock occurring in the fireball , then it would be followed by a fast decay .",
    "the rise of this peak is clearly visible at @xmath70s after the trigger . assuming this value for @xmath66 gives a decay slope of @xmath71 which , combined with an energy spectral index of @xmath72 , does not satisfy eq .  [ eq2 ]",
    "the situation does not improve by choosing slightly different values of @xmath66 .",
    "second , the spectrum of the second peak differs ( @xmath73 ) from that of the previous phase , which could suggest a different origin , while it is much more in agreement with that observed during the late phases of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "late internal shocks might still be responsible for the second flare if , for instance , the emission does not stop suddenly after this peak and other weak flares are released superimposing on the decaying part . in this case",
    ", the decay would be shallower than that predicted by eq .",
    "moreover , collisions of different shells may well produce emission with diverse spectral properties , and the rapid increase of flux in the second flare , by a factor of @xmath74 within @xmath75s , supports the internal shock scenario .",
    "it should be noticed that the behaviour of grb 050712 x - ray afterglow is rather uncommon .",
    "flare spectra usually soften until they reach the relatively soft afterglow . in this case",
    ", the first flare is quite soft , but then the spectrum hardens at later times .",
    "however , the spectrum of the last flare is similar to that of the late afterglow , which is hard as compared with other afterglows of other gamma - ray bursts .",
    "an alternative possibility is that with the third flare we witness the onset of the standard afterglow , i.e. the creation of an `` external shock '' when the fireball runs into the circumburst medium .",
    "the standard afterglow model predicts that , as a shell of ejecta interacts with the circumburst medium , it gives rise to a `` forward shock '' , which propagates outward , and to a `` reverse shock '' , which moves inward through the ejecta ( @xcite ) . during this phase ,",
    "the observable characteristics depend on the dynamical conditions of the fireball .",
    "two regimes can be identified depending on the `` thickness '' of the fireball ( @xcite , hereafter sp99 ) .",
    "the difference between the two cases is whether a reverse shock becomes relativistic in the frame of unshocked material during its crossing of the shell .",
    "if this happens , the shell is defined as `` thick '' .",
    "otherwise , the shell is defined as `` thin '' . in the case of a thin shell",
    ", sp99 have shown that the evolution of the afterglow is well described by a powerlaw decay if the time is measured starting from the explosion time , which is a good approximation of the time at which the first photons are collected .",
    "the situation differs if the shell is `` thick '' , i.e. if    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the initial thickness of the shell in the observer frame , @xmath2 and @xmath78 are its initial lorentz factor and kinetic energy , @xmath79 is the number of particles of the circumburst medium per unit volume , and @xmath80 is the proton mass .",
    "if we assume typical parameters of e@xmath81 erg , n = 10 @xmath82 ( see @xcite ) and consider that @xmath83 , where t is the burst duration , we need to have @xmath84 , which is easy to satisfy ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the energy is released into the surrounding material only when the shell has been crossed by the reverse shock . following again sp99",
    "( see also @xcite ) , this happens after a time @xmath85 , roughly similar to the burst duration . only from the time @xmath86 onward , the deceleration of the shell scales as @xmath87",
    ", in a self - similar manner , and the afterglow decay can be fitted by a power law ( or broken power law ) model .",
    "quite interestingly , we find that this might the case of grb  050712 . by rescaling the zero - time to @xmath88s ( i.e. to the onset of the third peak )",
    "we find that a broken powerlaw model provides an acceptable fit of the lightcurve at @xmath89 , with @xmath90 for 23 degrees of freedom ( see fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) , which is acceptable at @xmath91 c.l .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath92 , @xmath93 for the two decay slopes before and after the break , and t@xmath94s .",
    "the presence of a break is statistically significant since a fit with a single powerlaw gives @xmath95 for 25 d.o.f .",
    "the comparison between the optical and x - ray lightcurve is also illuminating .",
    "first of all , in the optical we do not see the strong variability that is present in the x - ray lightcurve .",
    "we have tried to fit the uvot v datapoints with a rescaled x - ray lightcurve in the first 10000s , and we have obtained a @xmath96 for 13 d.o.f .",
    "therefore , the probability that the 2 lightcurves are consistent is only @xmath97 .",
    "the major differences in the two lightcurves arise from the first part . in the v band lightcurve",
    "we see no increase correspondent to the first and second x - ray flares , no decrease at the time of the steep decay at @xmath98s , and again no increase at the time of the rise of the third flare .",
    "rather , the optical lightcurve in the first 500s is fully compatible with being constant : a fit with a constant gives @xmath99 .",
    "this suggests that the origin of the optical emission is different from that of the x - ray . a possible origin for the optical emission would be `` reverse shocks '' crossing the ejecta inwards , as already suggested in the case of grb990123 and grb021211 @xcite .",
    "reverse shocks are mild - relativistic , so their emission is not expected to be associated with very fast fluctuations of the radiation , as in case of internal shocks .",
    "after it reaches the peak , reverse shock emission is usually expected to fade away with a powelaw decay @xmath100 , and it has been shown by several authors ( see zhang & kobayashi 2005 , zhang et al .",
    "2003 , kobayashi et al . 2000 ) that , if ejecta are magnetized and the optical band is below the synchrotron cooling frequency , the peak itself may be broad and the slope more gentle , @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , the emission from the reverse shock may well overlap that of the forward shock component after the forward shock peak time ( grb 021211 may be a marginal such case , see zhang et al .",
    "in the case at hand , we see a decrease in the optical starting 500s after the trigger , roughly after the peak in the x - ray .",
    "the optical - to - x energy index @xmath102 fluctuates until @xmath1500s after the trigger , when it stabilizes at @xmath103 , remaining consistent with this value for the rest of the afterglow .",
    "these clues suggest that reverse shocks may be responsable for the flat emission registered in the first few hundreds seconds , while , from @xmath1500s onwards , the optical and x - ray emission are produced by the same mechanism , possibly due to the forward shock as previously discussed .",
    "regardless of the interpretation of the third flare , after the second orbits ( i.e. 5000s after the trigger ) _ swift _ observed the x - ray afterglow of grb050712 and detected a break in the decay slope .",
    "we find that the values of two decay indices as well as the break time are weakly dependent on the exact start of the afterglow .",
    "the initial shallow decay ( @xmath104 ) and the break could be explained either by a late , continuous energy injection from the inner engine ( @xcite , @xcite ) , or , alternatively , by a model in which the central engine activity is as brief as the prompt emission itself but , at the end of the prompt phase , the ejecta are released with different lorentz factors ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two scenarios are observationally indistinguishable , although the second one reconciles better with the scenario of the onset of the afterglow at the third peak , as we shall see in the following .    in the first case ,",
    "a source luminosity law of the kind @xmath105 is assumed , where t is the intrinsic time of the central engine ( or the observer s time after the cosmological time dilation correction ) .",
    "following ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the spectral and decay slopes are linked through the relation    @xmath106    for the values of the indices we have before the break , we obtain @xmath107 . after the break",
    ", we get @xmath108 . in the continuous energy injection scenario",
    ", the former case indicates that the central engine produces a substantial amount of energy , which affects the fireball evolution . instead",
    ", for @xmath108 , the energy which is added is small compared to the energy already injected and it does not affect the fireball evolution effectively .    in the second scenario ,",
    "the fastest shells initiate the forward shock , decelerate , and are successively caught by the slowest shells .",
    "the consequent addition of energy in the blast - wave mitigates the deceleration and the afterglow decay rate . assuming that the mass @xmath109 of the ejecta follows the law    @xmath110    where @xmath2 is the lorentz factor , the spectral and decay slope must be linked through the relationship ( @xcite ) :    @xmath111    the degeneracy of the two models consists in the fact that a non - vanishing @xmath112 index mimics the same effect of non - vanishing @xmath113 index , although the physical mechanisms involved are different . + from the values of @xmath113",
    "reported above , we obtain @xmath114 before the break and @xmath115 after the break . before the break time",
    ", the fast shells are decelerated initially with the slow shells lag behind ballistically and , when the fast ones are delerated enough , they are catch up by the slow shells .",
    "it is such pile up that gives an efficient conversion of energy : a steep distribution of the shells is required in order to have a significant energy injection into the blast wave , with more energy carried by slow shells . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lorentz factor distribution is flatter than @xmath116 , the injected energy is much smaller than that already present in the blastwave , so that the fireball dynamics is unaffected , and the afterglow enters the `` normal decay '' phase .      there is a general , growing , evidence for the association of long grbs with the death of ultramassive stars ( galama et al . 2000 , stanek et al . 2003 , hjorth et al . 2003 , zeh et al . 2004 ) .",
    "since these objects have a short lifetime ( @xmath117  yrs ) , it is expected that grb explosions take place close to or inside the original star forming regions , where a dense circumburst medium is present .",
    "thus , high level of absorption are expected , and this is consistent with the observations in ( @xmath118 ) of swift bursts ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in order to verify the presence of an extragalactic absorber ,",
    "we have first fitted the x - ray data with an absorbed power law model , by keeping the absorption fixed at the galactic value of @xmath119@xmath14 ( dickey & lockmann 1990 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 for the wt data taken during the first and second flare , the wt data taken after the second flare , and the pc data taken during the third flare , respectively .",
    "later data have not been included in this analysis , because their statistics is quite poor .",
    "we then repeated the fit by adding an extra absorption component , and fixing the redshift at @xmath123 .",
    "we obtain @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , for the same three segments .",
    "we have calculated the probability of a chance improvement by means of the f - test ( see , however , protassov et al .",
    "we get @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "very similar results have been obtained by varying the redshift from z=0.5 to z=2 .",
    "results of the fits have been reported in table  [ tab_spec ] .",
    "therefore , data gives a marginal indication for some intrinsic absorption for grb  050712 , at least in the first interval .",
    "assuming a putative redshift @xmath123 , the value of the excess column density would be @xmath130@xmath14 , @xmath131@xmath14 and @xmath132@xmath14 : there could be some indication of a decreasing column density , although all these values are also consistent with @xmath133@xmath14 .",
    "we presented _ swift _ observations of the grb  050712 and we discussed the properties of its optical and x - ray afterglows .",
    "the x - ray light curve of this burst does not decay immediately after the high energy event , but it shows two episodes of flares in the first @xmath134s .",
    "we find that the first and second flare is likely to be explained in terms of late internal shock emission .",
    "however , this might be not the case for the third flare .",
    "the different interpretation is based on the fact that during the second rise of the x - ray flux , the xrt spectrum is different from that detected during the previous phases , and more similar to that observed at the late afterglow epochs .",
    "furthermore , the flux of the `` flare '' can be connected with the late afterglow lightcurve with a broken powerlaw model , if the zero time is rescaled to the time of the onset of the peak .",
    "this is what is expected if the ejecta have been crossed by the reverse shocks , roughly at a time similar to that of the burst duration , and the onset of the external shock follows .",
    "moreover , after the epoch of the third flare we observe a steepening of the optical - to - x - ray spectral index , @xmath102 . this would suggest an increase in the optical emission , perhaps due to the contribution of the starting forward shock running in the circumburst medium .",
    "@xmath102 takes the value that will have for the remaining afterglow from this epoch .",
    "although an internal shock interpretation can not be completely ruled out , all these findings may also suggest that the last `` peak '' represent the beginning of the standard afterglow phase .",
    "+ the spectral fit also suggests some hints of intrisic absorption , at least in the first @xmath135s . assuming z=1 , the value would be @xmath136 cm@xmath15 , which is in the range of values for dense giant molecular clouds . if real , this finding is consistent with the idea of massive progenitors for grbs . we can not firmly establish whether or not the column density decreases at later times ( e.g. by progressive ionization )",
    "; we only note that , if the intrinsic absorption is not changing , it implies that the absorbing medium should be not very close to the place where the grb took place ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fit presented in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] shows that , up to @xmath138ks , the observed decay slope is rather shallow , with a slope @xmath139 .",
    "this might be explained if a residual , continuous energy injection from the inner engine lasted at late times , with a luminosity law @xmath140 .",
    "a different explanation , that does not require a late - time reactivation of the central engine , is that ejecta are released with different lorentz factor according to the distribution @xmath141 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the decay slope observed after the break , @xmath142 is instead close to the standard decay slope observed in x - ray afterglows @xmath143 day after the @xmath2-ray event ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the constraint to the redshift ( @xmath144 ) enables us to set an upper limit on the energy emitted in @xmath2-ray and x - rays by grb  050712 .",
    "if we assume @xmath33 ( which is _ the _ upper limit ) , and a spectral shape with low energy spectral index -0.5 , typical break energy of @xmath145 kev and high energy slope = -1.5 , the k - corrected 1 - 10000  kev energy emitted by grb  050712 is @xmath146  erg .",
