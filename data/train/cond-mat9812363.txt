    "simple _ liquids with many of the experimental data for the molecular glass forming liquids seems to be surprising , since the orientational degrees of freedom do not appear in the original version of mct @xcite . to do a quantitative comparison between theory and experiment or simulation and especially to describe the molecular correlations ( including orientational degrees of freedom )",
    "it is necessary to extend mct to molecular liquids . in particular ,",
    "a molecular mode coupling theory ( mmct ) allows to study the role of the coupling between the translational degrees of freedom and orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "such an extension has recently been performed for a single dumbbell molecule in an isotropic liquid @xcite and for a liquid of diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite and @xcite even treat general molecules .    mmct is also conceptually based on the hypothesis that the liquid structure is controlling the long - time dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "structural information is used as input in the theory via generalization of the density - density structure factor including the angular degrees of freedom .",
    "such quantities , although they are difficult to determine experimentally , can be evaluated from molecular dynamics trajectories and used to test the quality of the recently proposed mmct . for the case of a liquid of diatomic molecules ,",
    "the molecular structure factors have been evaluated@xcite and a first quantitative test of mmct has been presented in ref .",
    "furthermore , the temperature dependence of the molecular correlation functions can give hints regarding the leading mechanism for the slowing down of the dynamics .",
    "the asymptotic predictions of mct continue to be valid within the mmct scheme .",
    "also in mmct@xcite @xmath9 there exists a @xmath10relaxation regime where the factorization of the time or frequency  dependence of the correlators or susceptibilities from the space and angular dependence holds generically and the time ",
    "dependence is given by the @xmath10correlator which fulfills the _ first scaling law _ @xcite and @xmath11 there exists an @xmath12relaxation regime in    which the _ second scaling law _",
    "@xcite holds , i.e. the time ",
    "temperature superposition principle is fulfilled@xcite .",
    "these two results underline the _ universality _ of the ideal structural glass transition based on a bifurcation scenario described by a fold  singularity @xcite . however , the calculation of the various exponents ( entering the scaling laws ) , the calculation of the critical nonergodicity parameter , the critical amplitudes , the transition temperature @xmath7 and particularly of the molecular correlation functions themselves require the solution of the mmct equations .",
    "in this article we present the temperature and @xmath8-vector dependence of the generalized structure factors required by the mmct for the case of spc / e potential@xcite .",
    "this potential , which describes the molecule as a rigid planar body and models the pair interactions as a sum of electrostatic and lennard jones terms , has been studied in detail and has been shown to reproduce qualitatively the characteristic properties of liquid water  a liquid where the slowing down of the dynamics on cooling is _ not _ related to packing constraints but to the formation of a tetrahedral network of highly directional hydrogen bonds@xcite .",
    "previous numerical studies on the spc / e system , focused on the center of mass self@xcite and collective properties@xcite , have shown on a semi  quantitative level that the center of mass dynamics is well described by mct , with an estimated critical temperature of about @xmath13 .",
    "it has been shown that orientational degrees of freedom are crucial in strongly enhancing the slowing down of the dynamical processes on supercooling .",
    "this has led to the introduction of a semi ",
    "schematic mct model @xcite where the coupling to the orientational degrees of freedom is accounted for phenomenologically by the introduction of a parameter @xmath14 by which the coupling of the center of mass  density modes is enhanced . this semischematic approach , recently tested also for the case of a supercooled liquid of diatomic molecules@xcite , focuses only on the center of mass translational degrees of freedom and is by construction unable to describe the time evolution of the orientational degrees of freedom and to indicate which orientational degrees of freedom are responsible of the slowing down of the center of mass and orientational dynamics .",
    "a mmct description is required to fully describe these important dynamical aspects .",
    "the generalized structure factors presented in this article are a first step in the direction of solving the mmct for a molecular system . in section",

    "these relations reduce drastically the number of independent @xmath0 correlation functions and support the feasibility of a full mmct calculation for this class of liquids . finally , in sec.[sec : res ] we present the time evolution of the generalized angular correlation functions for the spc / e case and interpret their behavior in the general mct framework .",
    "the qualitative and semi - quantitative agreement between numerical data and asymptotic mct theoretical predictions strongly suggests to perform a full mmct comparison .",
    "to describe a molecular liquid it is necessary to introduce , besides the information on the position of the molecule s center of mass , the information on the orientation of the molecules .",
    "the microscopic density , defined for simple ( atomic ) liquids as @xmath16 , is generalized to @xmath17 where the sum runs over the @xmath18 molecules of the liquid , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the position of the center of mass and the euler angles of the @xmath21th molecule at time @xmath22 .",

    ", this choice produces real correlators also for @xmath4 and @xmath33 at high temperature .",

    "@xcite for _ linear _ molecules .",
    "although their introduction is enforced by theoretical reasons since homogeneity and isotropy of the liquid is accounted for directly by the fourier transformation to the @xmath39space and their tensorial nature , only very few of them can be measured experimentally .",
    "for instance @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be obtained from dielectric measurement and nmr , respectively .",
    "information on the center of mass  correlator @xmath42 follows from light scattering , provided that the contribution of the orientational correlators can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the neutron scattering cross section is a linear superposition of _ all _ of these correlators ( see e.g. @xcite ) from which information on the individual correlators could be obtained by choosing different scattering lengths of the atomic units . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a great advantage of a md  simulation , which really determines the trajectories @xmath43 , that these correlation functions can be calculated .",
    "this of course can only be done for @xmath44 and @xmath45 smaller than a cut  off value @xmath46 which will in the analysis of the spc / e data be chosen as @xmath47 .",
    "in this section we will discuss the general properties of the correlators ( [ a5]),([a6 ] ) and ( [ a7 ] ) which follow from symmetry .",
    "similar discussions have been done for an expansion into rotational invariants and in real space @xcite .",
    "the properties presented in the following will be of great importance for the discussion of the results of the simulation and especially to reduce the effort for the solution of the mmct equations which we will present in a subsequent paper .",
    "concerning symmetry , we have to distinguish between _ global _ and _ local _ symmetries where the latter are related to the geometry of a single ( rigid ) molecule .",
    "the global symmetries arise from the invariance of the molecular interactions under the simultaneous translation or rotation of _ all _ molecules , provided that the external potentials are zero .",
    "similarly the absence of a time ",
    "dependent external force implies time translational and time reversal symmetry which are the same as for simple liquids and therefore will not be discussed here .",
    "the invariance under translations in space has been already accounted for by the transformation into @xmath39space , i.e. what remains is the discussion of the transformation of the molecular correlators under rotations and reflections@xcite .",
    "let us start with the proper transformations @xmath48 . immediately from the transformation of @xmath49 under @xmath50 follows the transformation law for the molecular correlators : @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "the choice of the @xmath8frame , i.e. the laboratory frame of reference oriented such that @xmath39 lies along the @xmath53axis , @xmath54 , leads to a simplification of the molecular correlators . for a rotation @xmath55 around the @xmath53axis for which @xmath56 , eq.([a8 ] )",
    "implies : @xmath57 where @xmath58 has been used .",
    "since ( [ a9 ] ) is valid for _ all _ @xmath12 , the correlators in @xmath8frame must be diagonal in @xmath59 and @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "since ( [ a8 ] ) is also true for @xmath63 and @xmath64 the @xmath59diagonality also holds for these quantities .",
    "a further relationship follows from ( [ a8 ] ) by choosing a rotation @xmath65 by @xmath66 around the @xmath67axis : @xmath68 here we considered that @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 ) denotes @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) .",
    "next we investigate the inversion @xmath74 for which @xmath75 . then ( [ a8 ] ) yields @xmath76 which is valid for arbitrary @xmath39 .",

    "this symmetry means that the molecule possesses a @xmath86fold rotational axis and @xmath86 planes of reflection symmetry which contain the rotational axis .",
    "it is obvious that application of the local symmetry operations to any single molecule must leave the interaction invariant .",
    "let us begin with the @xmath86fold rotational symmetry .",
    "without restriction of generality we choose the body  fixed @xmath53axes along the @xmath86fold symmetry axis . in that case the @xmath86fold symmetry only affects the third euler angle @xmath87 .",

    "for the case of water ( r=2 ) , eqs.([a19 ] ) requires @xmath82 to be even , a condition which simplifies eq.([q2 ] ) further .",
    "what remains to be discussed is the role of the reflection symmetry .",

    "in this section we present a detailed analysis of the static and dynamic rotational correlators as calculated from a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of a molecular network - forming liquid .",
    "the system is a liquid of 216 rigid molecules whose geometric parameters are chosen in such a way to mimic water molecules .",

    " as it will be shown in the following  some of the molecular correlators present unexpected peaks at wave vectors smaller than the center - of - mass peak position , corresponding to a distance of about three molecular diameters , and since the amplitude of these peaks grows at low temperature , we have made the additional effort to equilibrate a system made of 1728 molecules at @xmath104 to make sure that no finite size effects show up in the molecular correlators for the system size considered .    in order to calculate the euler angles of each molecule",
