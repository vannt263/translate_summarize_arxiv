    "the analysis of conformational transitions a single polymer in solvent can experience is surprisingly difficult . in good solvent ( or high temperatures ) , solvent molecules occupy binding sites of the polymer and , therefore , the probability of noncovalent bonds between attractive segments of the polymer is small . the dominating structures in this phase are dissolved or random coils . approaching the critical point at the @xmath0 temperature , the polymer collapses and in a cooperative arrangement of the monomers , globular conformations are favorably formed . at the @xmath0 point , which has already been studied over many decades ,",
    "the infinitely long polymer behaves like a gaussian chain , i.e. , the effective repulsion due to the volume exclusion constraint is exactly balanced by the attractive monomer - monomer interaction . below the @xmath0 temperature , the polymer enters the globular phase , where the influence of the solvent is small .",
    "globules are very compact conformations , but there is little internal structure , i.e. , the globular phase is still entropy - dominated . for this reason , a further transition towards low - degenerate energetic states is expected to happen : the freezing or crystallization of the polymer .",
    "since this transition can be considered as a liquid - solid phase separation process , it is expected to be of first order , in contrast to the @xmath0 transition , which exhibits characteristics of a second - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of this problem appears in the quantitative description of these processes . from the analysis of the corresponding field theory  @xcite",
    "it is known that for the @xmath0 transition the upper critical dimension is @xmath1 , i.e. , multiplicative and additive logarithmic corrections to the gaussian scaling are expected and , indeed , predicted by field theory  @xcite . however , until now neither experiments nor computer simulations could convincingly provide evidence for these logarithmic corrections .",
    "this not only regards analyses of different single - polymer models  @xcite , but also the related problem of critical mixing and unmixing in polymer solutions  @xcite .    in a remarkable recent study of a bond - fluctuation polymer model",
    ", it was shown that , depending on the intramolecular interaction range , collapse and freezing transition can fall together in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "this surprising phenomenon is , however , not general . for an off - lattice bead - spring polymer with fene ( finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ) bond potential and intra - monomer lennard ",
    "jones interaction , for example , it could be shown that both transitions remain well separated in the limit of infinitely long chains  @xcite .    in our study , we investigate collapse and freezing of a single homopolymer restricted to simple cubic ( sc ) and face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattices .",
    "we primarily focus on the freezing transition , where comparatively little is known as most of the analytical and computational studies in the past were devoted to the controversially discussed collapse transition ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "a precise statistical analysis of the conformational space relevant in this low - temperature transition regime is difficult as it is widely dominated by highly compact low - energy conformations which are entropically suppressed .",
    "most promising for these studies appear sophisticated chain - growth methods based on rosenbluth sampling  @xcite combined with improved pruning - enrichment strategies  @xcite which , in their original formulation , are particularly useful for the sampling in the @xmath0 regime . for the analysis of the freezing transition",
    ", we apply in our simulations more generalized contact - density variants  @xcite , which have proven to be very successful in the low - energy sampling of protein - like heteropolymers  @xcite and the adsorption of polymers and peptides to solid substrates  @xcite .",
    "the precision of these algorithms when applied to lattice polymers as in the present study , is manifested by unraveling even finite - length effects induced by symmetries of the underlying lattice .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : models ] , the lattice model for flexible polymers and the employed chain - growth methods , which allow for a precise statistical sampling even in the low - temperature regime , are described .",
    "the conformational transitions the polymers experience on sc and fcc lattices are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] . here",
    ", we also present our results for the scaling of the collapse transition temperature in comparison with various approaches known from the literature . eventually , in sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , the paper is concluded by a summary of our findings .",
    "for our studies , we employ the interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) model for lattice polymers . in this model , the polymer chain is not allowed to cross itself , i.e. , a lattice site can only be occupied by a single monomer . in order to mimic the `` poor solvent '' behavior in the energetic regime , i.e. , at low temperatures , nearest - neighbor contacts of nonadjacent monomers reduce the energy .",
    "thus , the most compact conformations possess the lowest energy .",
    "formally , the total energy of a conformation @xmath2 of a chain with @xmath3 beads is simply given as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an unimportant energy scale ( which is set @xmath6 in the following ) and @xmath7 is the number of nearest - neighbor contacts between nonbonded monomers .",
    "the total number of self - avoiding lattice conformations with @xmath8 bonds scales as  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the effective coordination number of the lattice and @xmath11 a universal exponent . for the sc lattice ,",
    "the connectivity constant is @xmath12 and in the fcc case @xmath13  @xcite . due to this exponential growth of the number of conformations ,",
    "the investigation of all conformational transitions a homopolymer of a given length can experience requires employing numerical methods being capable of estimating the density of states for all possible energies with high precision",
    ". there exist mainly two strategies for generating and updating conformations within the stochastic search schemes typically used . applying standard markov chain monte carlo methods ,",
    "conformational updates include semilocal changes of bond orientations as , among others , corner and end flips , crankshaft moves , and more non - local updates such as pivot rotations . in our work , we have used the alternative concept of chain growth .",
    "depending on the lattice constraints , a new monomer is tried to be attached to an end of the already existing chain until the total length or a `` dead end '' is reached , i.e. , all neighbors are already occupied and , thus , the chain end is trapped . in an early approach , the rosenbluth method  @xcite , firstly the number of free nearest neighbors @xmath14 for the possible placements of the @xmath15th monomer is determined .",
    "then , one of the possibilities ( if any ) is selected randomly .",
    "the peculiarity is that this algorithm introduces a bias as the ( athermal ) probability of generating a certain chain conformation @xmath16 of length @xmath3 , @xmath17 , depends on the growth direction .",
    "thus , identical walks can possess different construction probabilities , if they , e.g. , were grown `` forward '' or `` backward '' .",
    "for correct statistics , this bias must be corrected by introducing rosenbluth weights @xmath18 .",
    "actually , this bias can be utilized to increase the efficiency of the method in generating self - avoiding walks which is particularly useful for the isaw model of lattice polymers . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to introduce for each chain a thermal rosenbluth weight @xmath19/k_b t\\}$ ] ( where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant which we set to @xmath21 in our analysis ) .",
    "since this method is a clever kind of simple sampling , the partition sum can be estimated _ absolutely _ as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of successfully generated polymer chains of length @xmath3 in @xmath24 growth starts  @xcite . in principle , since @xmath25 , an absolute estimate of the density of states @xmath26 , i.e. , the degeneracy of energetic states @xmath27 , is then also known .",
    "this is particularly important for heteropolymers , where the ground - state degeneracy is considered as a measure for the stability of native folds of lattice proteins  @xcite .",
    "an essential improvement of the efficiency of this chain - growth approach was reached by the introduction of the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm )  @xcite and its enhanced variants  @xcite , which combine rosenbluth chain growth with a go with the winners  @xcite strategy . in these algorithms , at each stage of the growth process copies of the already existing chain segment are created and continue growing independently , if the accumulated rosenbluth weight is larger than an upper threshold . if the weight falls below a lower bound , the chain is pruned with a certain probability ( which is typically 1/2 ) .",
    "otherwise , the growth of the single chain simply continues .",
    "this method has frequently been applied in studies of the @xmath0 point  @xcite . in our study",
    ", we use the npermss ( new perm with simple sampling ) variant  @xcite for the simulation of @xmath0 polymers with chain lengths of up to 32000 ( sc ) and 4000 ( fcc ) monomers , respectively .    for the analysis of the conformational behavior below the @xmath0 point , we use even more sophisticated , generalized - ensemble variants which are independent of the temperature and yield an improved estimate for the density of states @xmath28 within a single simulation .",
    "these algorithms combine perm - based chain growth with multicanonical  @xcite or flat - histogram techniques  @xcite and increase , in particular , the sampling of entropically suppressed ( `` rare '' ) conformations , which are , for example , essential for the study of the freezing transition . due to the much higher demands in this regime , maximum chain lengths , for which precise results were reliably obtained , are @xmath29 ( sc ) and 56 ( fcc ) , respectively .    for our statistical analysis , it is convenient to define energetic statistical expectation values via the density of states , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "the main results of our analysis are based on the peak structure of the specific heat which is defined as @xmath31 .",
    "it was recently found for a bond - fluctuation model with inter - monomeric interaction radius @xmath32 that in the infinite chain - length limit collapse and freezing are indistinguishable phase transitions appearing at the same temperature ( the @xmath0 temperature @xmath33 )  @xcite . in a bead - spring fene model analysis",
    "@xcite , this phenomenon could not be observed : both transitions exist in the thermodynamic limit and the crossover peaks in the specific heat remain well - separated . the same observation was made independently in ref .",
    "@xcite for the bond - fluctuation model with increased interaction range . in the following ,",
    "we perform for the lattice polymer model ( [ eq : mod ] ) a detailed analysis of these transitions on regular sc and fcc lattices and discuss the expected behavior in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "= 8.8 cm    = 8.8 cm    statistical fluctuations of the energy , as expressed by the specific heat , can signalize thermodynamic activity",
    ". peaks of the specific heat as a function of temperature are indicators for transitions or crossovers between physically different macrostates of the system . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the collective activity , which influences typically most of the system particles , corresponds to thermodynamic phase transitions . for a flexible polymer ,",
    "three main phases are expected : the random - coil phase for temperatures @xmath34 , where conformations are unstructured and dissolved ; the globular phase in the temperature interval @xmath35 ( @xmath36 : melting temperature ) with condensed , but unstructured ( `` liquid '' ) conformations dominating ; and for @xmath37 the `` solid '' phase characterized by locally crystalline or amorphous metastable structures . in computer simulations , only polymers of finite length are accessible and , therefore , the specific heat possesses typically a less pronounced peak structure , as finite - length effects can induce additional signals of structural activity and shift the transition temperatures .",
    "these effects , which are typically connected with surface - reducing monomer rearrangements , are even amplified by steric constraints in lattice models as used in our study .",
    "although these pseudotransitions are undesired in the analysis of the thermodynamic transitions , their importance in realistic systems is currently increasing with the high - resolution equipment available in experiment and technology .",
    "the miniaturization of electronic circuits on polymer basis and possible nanosensory applications in biomedicine will , therefore , require a more emphasized analysis of the finite - length effects in the future .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows typical examples of specific heats for very short chains on the sc lattice and documents the difficulty of identifying the phase structure of flexible homopolymers .",
    "the 27-mer exhibits only a single dominating peak  which is actually only an sc lattice effect .",
    "the reason is that the ground states are cubic ( @xmath38 ) and the energy gap towards the first excited states is @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "actually , also the most pronounced peaks for @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) are due to the excitation of perfectly cuboid and cubic ground states , respectively .",
    "the first significant onset of the collapse transition is seen for the 48-mer close to @xmath44 .",
    "a clear discrimination between the excitation and the melting transition is virtually impossible . in these examples , solely for @xmath42 three separate peaks are present .",
    "the plots in figs .",
    "[ fig:8](a)[fig:8](c ) show representative conformations in the different pseudophases of the 64-mer . due to the energy gap , the excitations of the cubic ground state with energy @xmath45 ( not shown ) to conformations with @xmath46 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:8](a ) ] result in a pseudotransition which is represented by the first specific - heat peak in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the second less - pronounced peak in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] around @xmath47 signalizes the melting into globular structures , whereas at still higher temperatures @xmath48 the well - known collapse peak indicates the dissolution into the random - coil phase .",
    "= 8.8 cm    the distribution of the maximum values of the specific heat @xmath49 with respect to the maximum temperatures @xmath50 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "not surprisingly , the peaks belonging to the excitation and freezing transitions ( @xmath51 ) appear to be irregularly `` scattered '' in the low - temperature interval @xmath52 .",
    "the height of the peaks indicating the collapse transition of the finite - length polymers ( @xmath53 ) is , on the other hand , monotonously increasing with the collapse - peak temperature .",
    "= 8.8 cm    = 17.6 cm    figures  [ fig:3](a ) and  [ fig:3](b ) , showing the respective chain - length dependence of the maximum temperatures and maximum specific - heat values , reveal a more systematic picture . at least from the results for the short chains shown , general scaling properties for the freezing transition",
    "can not be read off at all .",
    "the reason is that the low - temperature behavior of these short chains is widely governed by lattice effects .",
    "this is clearly seen by the `` sawtooth '' segments . whenever the sc chain possesses a `` magic '' length @xmath54 such that the ground state is cubic or cuboid ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) , the energy gap @xmath39 between the ground - state conformation and the first excited state entails a virtual energetic barrier which results in an excitation transition .",
    "since entropy is less relevant in this regime , this energetic effect is not `` averaged out '' and , therefore , causes a pronounced peak in the specific heat [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) ] at comparatively low temperatures [ fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) ] .",
    "this peculiar sc lattice effect vanishes widely by increasing the length by unity , i.e. , for chain lengths @xmath56 . in this case , the excitation peak either vanishes or remains as a remnant of less thermodynamic significance .",
    "the latter appears particularly in those cases , where @xmath57 with @xmath58 ( with @xmath59 being any positive integer ) is a chain length allowing for perfectly cubic ground states . increasing the polymer length further",
    ", the freezing peak dominates at low temperatures .",
    "its peak increases with the chain length , whereas the peak temperature decreases .",
    "actually , with increasing chain length , the character of the transition converts from freezing to excitation , i.e. , the entropic freedom that still accompanies the melting / freezing process decreases with increasing chain length .",
    "in other words , cooperativity is lost : only a small fraction of monomers  residing in the surface hull  is entropically sufficiently flexible to compete the energetic gain of highly compact conformations .",
    "this flexibility is reduced the more , the closer the chain length @xmath3 approaches a number in the `` magic '' set @xmath60 . if the next length belonging to @xmath60 is reached , the next discontinuity in the monotonic behavior occurs . since noticeable `` jumps '' are only present for chain lengths whose ground states are close to cubes ( @xmath58 ) or cuboids with @xmath61 , the length of the branches in between scales with @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , only for very long chains on the sc lattice , for which , however , a precise analysis of the low - temperature behavior is extremely difficult , a reasonable scaling analysis for @xmath63 and @xmath64 could be performed .",
    "exemplified for chains of lengths @xmath65 and @xmath56 with @xmath66 , specific heats and densities of states are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:4](a)[fig:4](d ) , which exhibit the length - dependent characteristic properties discussed above . while in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) for chain lengths around @xmath67 only some low - temperature activity is visible and the collapse transition is vaguely indicated by a broad shoulder , the transition characteristics are better resolved for @xmath42 shown in fig .  [ fig:4](c ) .",
    "the most pronounced low - temperature peak of the specific heat of the 64-mer , for example , is the excitation peak , the second peak belongs to the freezing transition , and the third , still very shallow peak signals the collapse transition .",
    "the low - temperature behaviors of the 63-mer and the 65-mer are quite different : while the low - temperature peak of the 63-mer close to @xmath68 is due to excitation as is indicated by the @xmath46 `` dip '' in the density of states in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](d ) [ similar to the 35-mer in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) at @xmath69 , the relevant peak for the 65-mer is the freezing peak close to @xmath70 . in this case",
    ", the excitation is of much less relevance ( although it is still reflected by a small peak near @xmath71 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the missing convex lowest - energy dip in the density of states ( or microcanonical entropy ) .",
    "the convex monotony is a signal of a strong first - order phase separation  @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by analyzing the canonical energy distributions for the examples @xmath65 and @xmath56 with @xmath66 shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:5](a)[fig:5](c ) for temperatures close to the respective excitation and freezing transitions . for @xmath72 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) ] , the pronounced excitation transition is expressed by the respective double peaks with the strong gap in between , which are for the polymers with chain lengths @xmath66 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b ) ] due to the energy gap between ground state and first excited state .",
    "this induces the first - order - like character of this pseudotransition .",
    "the energy distributions for various temperatures shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](c ) for the case @xmath73 do not exhibit , on the other hand , pronounced double - peaked shapes .",
    "the excitation transition at extremely low energies is still weakly present as a small shoulder in the distribution at the corresponding temperature .",
    "the freezing transition is associated with slightly larger energies ( and temperature ) and visible in the distribution with a weak tendency to a double - peaked shape .",
    "the collapse transitions of the finite - length polymers are not affected by the intricate low - energy conformations on the sc lattice and exhibit a continuous monotony .",
    "this will be analyzed in sect .",
    "[ sec : theta ] in more detail .",
    "= 8.8 cm      the general behavior of polymers on the fcc lattice is comparable to what we found for the sc polymers .",
    "the main difference is that excitations play only a minor role , and the freezing transition dominates the conformational behavior of the fcc polymers at low temperatures .",
    "nonetheless , finite - length effects are still apparent as can be seen in the chain - length dependence of the peak temperatures and peak values of the specific heats plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcc1](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : fcc1](b ) , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : fcc1](a ) shows that the locations of the freezing and collapse transitions clearly deviate with increasing chain lengths and we hence can conclude that also for fcc polymers there is no obvious indication that freezing and collapse could fall together in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "similar to the sc polymers , the finite - length effects at very low temperatures are apparently caused by the usual compromise between maximum compactness , i.e. , maximum number of energetic ( nearest - neighbor ) contacts , and steric constraints of the underlying rigid lattice .",
    "the effects are smaller than in the case of the sc lattice , as there are no obvious `` magic '' topologies in the fcc case .",
    "ground - state conformations for a few small polymers on the fcc lattice are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcc2 ] .",
    "the general tendency is that the lowest - energy conformations consist of layers of net planes with ( 111 ) orientation , i.e. , the layers themselves possess triangular pattern with side lengths equal to the fcc nearest - neighbor distance @xmath74 ( in units of the lattice constant ) .",
    "this is not surprising , as these conformations are tightly packed which ensures a maximum number of nearest - neighbor contacts and , therefore , lowest conformational energy .",
    "an obvious example is the ground - state conformation of the 13-mer as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcc2](a ) which corresponds to the intuitive guess for the most closely packed structure on an fcc lattice : a monomer with its 12 nearest neighbors ( `` 373 '' layer structure ) . a simple contact counting yields 36 nearest - neighbor contacts which , by subtracting the @xmath75 covalent ( nonenergetic ) bonds , is equivalent to an energy @xmath76 .",
    "however , this lowest - energy conformation is degenerate .",
    "there is another conformation ( not shown ) consisting of only two `` layers '' , one containing 6 ( a triangle ) and the other 7 ( a hexagon ) monomers ( `` 67 '' structure ) , with the same number of contacts .",
    "= 8.8 cm    = 8.8 cm    a special case is the 18-mer . as fig .",
    "[ fig : fcc2](b ) shows , its ground state is formed by a complete triangle with 6 monomers , a hexagon in the intermediate layer with 7 monomers , and an incomplete triangle ( possessing a `` hole '' at a corner ) with 5 monomers ( `` 675 '' structure ) .",
    "although this imperfection seems to destroy all rotational symmetries , it is compensated by an additional symmetry : exchanging any of the triangle corners with the hole does not change the conformation at all ! thus , the seeming imperfection has a similar effect as the energetic excitation and causes a trivial entropic transition .",
    "this explains , at least partly , why the 18-mer exclusively exhibits an additional peak in the specific heat at very low temperatures [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : fcc1](a ) ] .",
    "a similar reasoning presumably also applies to the anomalous low - temperature peaks of the 32- , 46- , and 56-mers , but for these larger ground - state conformations it does not make much sense to go into such intricate details .",
    "the expectation that the 19-mer , which can form a perfect shape without any `` holes '' ( `` 676 '' structure ) , is a prototype of peculiar behavior is , however , wrong .",
    "this is due to the existence of degenerate less symmetric ground - state conformations [ as the exemplified conformation in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcc2](c ) ] .    the described geometric peculiarities are , however , only properties of very short chains",
    ". one of the largest of the `` small '' chains that still possesses a non - spherical ground state , is the 27-mer with the ground - state conformation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcc2](d ) . for larger systems ,",
    "the relative importance of the interior monomers will increase , because of the larger number of possible contacts .",
    "this requires the number of surface monomers to be as small as possible which results in compact , sphere - like shapes .",
    "a representative example is the 30-mer shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcc2](e ) .",
    "the scaling behavior of several quantities at and close to the @xmath0 point in three dimensions has been the subject of a large number of field - theoretic and computational studies  @xcite . nonetheless , the somewhat annoying result is that the nature of this phase transition is not yet completely understood .",

    "collapse on regular lattices , we mainly focused on the critical temperature @xmath33 for polymers on the sc and on the fcc lattice .",

    "surprisingly poor , on the other hand , is the goodness of the fit against the logarithmic scaling  ( [ eq : boyle ] ) .",
    "even more astonishing is , however , the good coincidence with a logarithmic fit of the `` wrong '' form @xmath79 with the data . summarizing these results , if logarithmic corrections as predicted by tricritical field theory are present at all , even chain lengths @xmath80 on an sc lattice are too small to observe deviations from the mean - field picture .",

    "the subleading additive corrections are expected to be of the form @xmath83",
    "they thus not only disappear very slowly  they are also even of the same size as the leading scaling behavior , which makes it extremely unlikely to observe the logarithmic corrections in computational studies at all  @xcite .",

    "the corresponding fcc results are listed in table  [ tab : fcc ] . in this case , only the fit function  ( [ eq : fhfit ] ) is independent of the data sets used and , therefore , consistent with the data obtained for all chain lengths .",
    "however , the noticeable improvement of the goodness for the fits to  ( [ eq : mffit ] ) , ( [ eg : fh ] ) and the `` wrong '' @xmath84 form by excluding the very short chains from the data sets considered , leads to the conclusion that even chains with @xmath85 monomers on the fcc lattice are also too short to find evidence for the logarithmic corrections to mean - field scaling .",
    "our best estimates for the fcc @xmath0 temperature agree nicely with the results from refs .",
    "employing sophisticated chain - growth algorithms , we have performed computer simulations of homopolymers on sc and fcc lattices in order to analyze freezing and collapse of these chains .",
    "particular attention has been devoted to the question whether these transitions fall together in the thermodynamic limit as it was reported recently from similar studies of a specific bond - fluctuation model . in our analysis , we focus on the shifts of the specific - heat peaks in dependence of the chain - lengths considered .    for polymers on the sc lattice , we find a remarkably systematic pattern of the freezing transition which can be explained by lattice effects of the finite - length systems .",
    "in fact , the high precision of our data allows us to reveal a noticeable difference in the behavior of `` magic '' chain lengths that allow for cubic or cuboid conformations . in these cases",
    ", an energy gap exists between the ground - state conformations and the first excitations .",
    "this peculiarity causes a first - order - like pseudotransition which is typically more pronounced than the separate freezing transition .",
    "surprisingly , this effect vanishes widely for polymers with slightly longer chain lengths . the freezing temperature decreases with increasing chain length until the next `` magic '' length is reached .",
    "polymers on the fcc lattice behave similarly , but the relevant geometries are more complex .    we have also performed comprising analyses of the collapse temperature deviations for finite - length polymers from the @xmath0 temperature , i.e. , the collapse transition temperature in the limit of infinite chain - length .",
    "we studied chains with lengths of up to 32000 ( sc ) and 4000 ( fcc ) monomers , respectively .",
    "the thus obtained data were fitted against several fit functions motivated by field - theoretic and mean - field - like approaches . for the chain lengths studied , we find no evidence for logarithmic corrections as predicted by tricritical field theory .",
    "we conclude that the chain lengths are still too short to uniquely identify logarithmic corrections which are probably effectively taken into account by the amplitudes of the dominant mean - field terms .    from our results for the freezing and the collapse transition ,",
    "we conclude that both transitions remain well separated also in the extrapolation towards the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is the expected behavior as it is a consequence of the extremely short range of attraction in the nearest - neighbor lattice models used .",

    "qualitatively , analogous to the behavior of colloids , our considerations would explain the separate stable crystal , globule , and random - coil that we have clearly identified in our lattice polymer study .",
    "since the range of interactions seems to play a crucial , quantitative role , it is an interesting , still widely open question to what extent the colloidal picture in the compact crystalline and globular phases is systematically modified for polymers with different nonbonded interaction ranges , where steric constraints ( through covalent bonds ) are a priori not negligible .",
