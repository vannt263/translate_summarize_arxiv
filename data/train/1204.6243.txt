    "the idea of supersymmetry has been considered for more than thirty five years as one of the most interesting ideas with application to particle physics . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "could be tested soon at the large hadron collider .",
    "however , it is very difficult to test its predictions because we know nothing about the supersymmetric spectrum , and about the presence of the lepton ( l ) and baryon ( b ) number violating interactions , which can modify most of the mssm predictions for collider physics and cosmology . in this short review",
    "i will discuss the new results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the mssm superpotential is given by @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 where the first three terms in @xmath3 break l , the last term violates b , and the interactions in @xmath4 break both symmetries .",
    "there are several phenomenological constraints on the b and l violating interactions , but the most important one is coming from proton decay .",
    "for example , if we assume that the couplings @xmath5 and @xmath6 are of order one and the squark mass around tev , the lifetime of the proton is about @xmath7 years .",
    "therefore , in order to satisfy the experimental bounds on the proton decay lifetime , @xmath8 years , it is important to understand the possible absence of these interactions .",
    "the operators in @xmath4 , eq.(3 ) , mediate the so - called dimension five contributions to proton decay  @xcite and the scale @xmath9 should be larger than @xmath10 gev in order to satisfy the experimental bounds .",
    "therefore , one has to assume a desert between the tev scale and grand unified scale .    in order to avoid the interactions in @xmath3 , eq.(2 ) , it is often assumed the discrete symmetry , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the spin and @xmath13 is called matter parity .",
    "notice that in this case the interactions in @xmath4 are allowed and still the scale @xmath9 has to be very large .",
    "unfortunately , in most of the studies the conservation of this symmetry is enforced or the explicit breaking is considered  @xcite . only a few groups have studied the dynamical origin of these interactions , see for example refs .",
    "the main goal of this review is to discuss the different theories where we can understand the conservation or violation of matter parity in supersymmetry .    in order to understand the origin of the b and l violating interactions in the mssm we can consider a theory defined at the tev scale or we can discuss this issue in the context of a grand unified theory in four dimensions . before we study any particular theory we have to notice the relation between matter parity and b - l .",
    "it is obvious that if we consider a theory where b - l is part of the gauge symmetry , at the b - l scale matter parity is conserved , but when the gauge symmetry is broken one has ( non ) conservation of @xmath14 if the field responsible for symmetry breaking has an ( odd ) even number of b-l.therefore , we can say that the theories based on the b - l gauge symmetry are the simplest frameworks where we can investigate this issue .",
    "let us consider the simplest supersymmetric theory based on the b - l gauge symmetry  @xcite @xmath15 where we have the mssm superfields , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the right - handed neutrinos needed to cancel the b - l anomalies , @xmath23 . in this context",
    "the superpotential has a simple form @xmath24 with @xmath25 as one expects , the r - parity violating terms in @xmath3 , eq.(2 ) , are not allowed before symmetry breaking .",
    "now , in the context of the minimal theory there is only one possibility to break the gauge symmetry , @xmath26 , to the sm symmetry .",
    "we have to give a vacuum expectation value to the only fields which can be responsible for b - l symmetry breaking , the right - handed sneutrinos @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , one can say that r - parity must be spontaneously broken and one expects lepton number violating signatures at the lhc . here",
    "the scale for b - l and r - parity violation is defined by the supersymmetric scale .",
    "it is easy to prove that we can give a vev to the fields @xmath27 in a consistent way , using the superpotential @xmath28 , the d - terms and the soft terms in @xmath29 one finds that the vev for the right - handed sneutrinos is given by @xmath30 with @xmath31 , and @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the b - l gauge coupling .",
    "the sfermion masses are different in this scenario because we have new contributions from the @xmath34 d - term and we can have tachyonic slepton masses if the @xmath35 mass is large .",
    "therefore , in order to have a realistic spectrum we have to impose the relation @xmath36",
    "the spectrum for neutrinos is peculiar in this theory .",
    "we have shown in ref  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the spectrum for neutrinos is different because there are five light neutrinos , the sm neutrinos and two sterile neutrinos .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the invisible decay of the @xmath37 is modified and maybe one can test this property at the lhc .",
    "it is important to mention that after symmetry breaking one obtains the bilinear lepton number violating terms at the renormalizable level , while the baryon number violating interactions are suppressed by the cutoff scale .",
    "then , assuming a large cutoff , @xmath38 gev , one can satisfy the bounds on the proton decay lifetime .",
    "the testability of this theory at the lhc has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we have discussed the most interesting signatures at the lhc in different lsp scenarios . here",
    "we will mention the most striking signals which can help us to test the lepton number and spontaneous r - parity violation .",
    "we focus on the case where the lightest supersymmetric particle is the neutralino . in this case",
    "one can have the following signals :    @xmath39        these signals with four leptons , three of them with the same electric charge , and four jets are background free .",
    "see fig . 1 for the topology of these events .",
    "we have investigated in detail the neutralino decays taking into account the constraints coming from neutrino physics and the slepton decays , showing that with a luminosity of @xmath40 we can have several events .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that there are many solutions where the neutralino is long lived giving raise to displaced vertices . in fig .",
    "2 we can see that the production cross section can be above 1 fb when the slepton mass is below 400 gev . in order to understand the discovery reach at the lhc we show in fig .",
    "2 ( right panel ) the number of events for different values of the slepton mass and branching ratios . in this way",
    "we can see the possibility to have a few events in large region of the parameter space , for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite .     mass .",
    "in the right panel we show the number of events  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   mass . in the right panel",
    "we show the number of events  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=251 ]    in summary , we can say that the minimal supersymmetric b - l theory  @xcite predicts :    * r - parity must be spontaneously broken . *",
    "the b - l and r - parity violating scales are determined by the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "* the theory predicts two light sterile neutrinos .",
    "* lepton number violating signals and displaced vertices at the lhc .",
    "we would like to mention that these results are valid for the simplest theories where b - l is part of gauge symmetry and the idea was realized for the first time in ref .",
    "it is important to emphasize again that in this case one needs to assume a large cutoff , i.e. a desert , in order to satisfy the constraints from proton decay . in the next sections we will discuss a model where one can break b and l at the low scale without generating any contribution to proton decay .",
    "now we discuss the minimal theory where one can explain dynamically the conservation of r - parity .",
    "we have discussed in the previous section that in the simplest b - l theory one should break r - parity .",
    "then , in order to have r - parity conservation we need to go beyond the minimal model and add extra higgses to give mass to the new neutral gauge boson in the theory .",
    "the superpotentional of a simple theory for r - parity conservation is given by @xmath41 we also could have two different scenarios : in the first case the new higgses do not generate neutrino mass  @xcite , or we can generate the mass for the @xmath37 gauge boson through the stueckelberg mechanism  @xcite . here",
    "we discuss the scenario where the neutrinos are majorana fermions and have the implementation of the radiative symmetry mechanism to break the local b - l gauge symmetry .     breaking vacuum in the @xmath42 space with @xmath43 tev , @xmath44 gev and @xmath45 .",
    "blue dots indicate r - parity conservation while red dots r - parity violation , the latter appears five times more often .",
    "the key point is that only fairly degenerate values of @xmath46 ( and therefore the right - handed neutrino masses ) allow for r - parity conservation  @xcite.,width=283 ]     for 14 tev assuming the input parameters listed in the plot . in the right panel",
    "we show right - handed neutrino decay length when the neutrino spectrum has a normal hierarchy  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   for 14 tev assuming the input parameters listed in the plot . in the right panel",
    "we show right - handed neutrino decay length when the neutrino spectrum has a normal hierarchy  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=253 ]    in this theory we can have two different vacua which break b - l . a ) r - parity conserving vacua : in this case only the higgses get a vev , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "b ) r - parity violating vacua : the right - handed sneutrinos get a vev . in fig .",
    "3 we show the possible solutions in the 3d @xmath42 space assuming boundary conditions  @xcite , @xmath49 .",
    "the blue and red points correspond to the solutions when r - parity is conserved and violated , respectively .",
    "therefore , one can appreciate in fig .",
    "3 that if we stick to the radiative symmetry mechanism and universal boundary conditions r - parity is spontaneously broken in the majority of the parameter space .",
    "this is an interesting result which hints at the possibility that r - parity violation is present in this theory .",
    "we should mention that this simple theory for r - parity conservation predicts that the b - l symmetry breaking scale and the right - handed neutrino masses are determined by the susy scale , and one expects lepton number violating signals from the higgs decays .",
    "this theory could be tested at the lhc if we understand the production mechanisms and decays of the new b - l higgses , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we have investigated the testability of this model at the lhc in ref .",
    "@xcite and found that the signals with same - sign leptons and two jets can be observed if we have high luminosity : @xmath52 in this case the number of events with two muons and four jets can be estimated as @xmath53 in fig .",
    "4 we show the cross section for the single higgs production ( left panel ) and the decay length of the right - handed neutrinos ( right panel ) .",
    "we can see that one has displaced vertices in a large fraction of the parameter space .",
    "therefore , we can have signals with two same - sign leptons and displaced vertices which are background free .",
    "the higgs pair production : @xmath54 , is very important to test this model and its prediction is independent of the supersymmetric spectrum . see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the study of the full spectrum assuming boundary conditions at the high scale .",
    "now , we can say that it is very easy to write down a theory for r - parity conservation at the tev scale and as in the previous model we can have interesting lepton number violating signals . in this context",
    "we can have the implementation of the radiative symmetry mechanism for the electroweak symmetry and the b - l gauge symmetry .",
    "the testability of this theory at the lhc could shed light on the connection between the cold dark matter in the universe and the possible observation of missing energy at the lhc .      in the previous sections we have discussed the simplest theory where one can understand the conservation or violation of @xmath55-parity .",
    "unfortunately , in these theories we have to postulate the desert between the tev scale and the grand unified scale in order to suppress the dimension five operators for proton decay .",
    "now , we would like to discuss a simple theory where the local baryon and lepton numbers are local symmetries spontaneously broken at the tev scale .",
    "this theory is based on the gauge symmetry  @xcite @xmath56 we refer to this model as the  blmssm \" . in this context",
    "there are no dangerous operators mediating proton decay because the lepton number is broken in an even number while the baryon number violating operators can change b by one unit . in this context",
    "the anomaly cancellation requires the presence of new families . in this context",
    "there is no flavour violation at tree level and in order to avoid landau poles at the low scale we generate vector - like masses for the new quarks .",
    "we have investigated the predictions for the light higgs boson mass showing that we can satisfy the experimental bounds without assuming a large stop mass and left - right mixing  @xcite .",
    "also we can modify the current lhc bounds on the supersymmetric spectrum due to the presence of the baryon number violating interactions .",
    "in this model we have the chiral superfields of the mssm , and in order to cancel the b and l anomalies we need a vector - like family : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the superpotential of the model is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the r - parity conserving mssm superpotential and @xmath71 the new quark superfields acquire tev scale masses once the @xmath72 and @xmath73 higgs fields acquire a vev . in the leptonic sector one has the following interactions @xmath74 here we have an implementation of the seesaw mechanism for the light neutrino masses once the @xmath75 field acquires a vev , while the new neutrinos have dirac mass terms . in order to avoid the stability for the new quarks we add the fields , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which have the following interactions @xmath78 where the baryon number for the new fields are : @xmath79 , and if we assume that they do not get a vev the lightest one can be a dark matter candidate",
    "even if r - parity is violated , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . for any value of the baryonic charges of the new fermions , which satisfy the anomaly conditions , the higgses @xmath80 and @xmath81 have charges @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "then , one can write the following dimension five operator which gives rise to baryon number violation once the local baryonic symmetry is broken through the vev of @xmath72 : @xmath84 therefore , after breaking @xmath85 we find the so - called @xmath6 mssm interactions which can modify the current lhc bounds on the supersymmetric mass spectrum .",
    "the b violating interactions can modify the signatures at the lhc .",
    "for example if the squark is the lsp it can be long - lived and form bounded states .",
    "now , if we compute the decay length of a squark one finds @xmath86 therefore , the squark will form bounded states but it will decay inside the detector . in this case",
    "we have used the bound from cosmology  @xcite , and it is possible to have displaced vertices as well when the stop ( sbottom ) has mass around 100 gev . for example , we can have signals with four jets from the decays of a stop or a sbottom @xmath87 therefore , one can avoid the lhc constraints coming from the searches for multijets and missing energy  @xcite .",
    "this theory also predicts light leptons which modify the predictions for the higgs mass . in fig .",
    "5 we show the constraints on the stop mass and the left - right mixing in the stop sector in the mssm and in the blmssm . here",
    "we use @xmath88 between 2 and 6 and see ref .",
