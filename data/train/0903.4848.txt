    "linear ordinary differential equations ( ode ) of the type @xmath7 are very important tools in many fields ( physics , engineering etc . ) . in many useful cases , the functions @xmath8 are polynomials or rational functions .",
    "as is well known , it is difficult in general to solve them analytically for higher - order cases although there are relatively general methods for second - order equations with low - degree polynomials @xmath8 , for which we employ hypergeometric functions ( or special functions )  @xcite and power series expansions about nonsingular points or regular singular points  @xcite .",
    "( practically , instead of analytical methods , many kinds of numerical methods have been proposed and used . )",
    "the aim of this paper is to obtain solutions @xmath9 of a linear ode ( [ eqn : haya-1 ] ) in a hilbert space @xmath3 of functions on @xmath10 when the equation is of higher order and/or the function @xmath8 is of higher degree .",
    "solutions with finite norm are sometimes very important in quantum mechanics ( e.g. wavefunctions of particles bound by potentials )  @xcite , and for transit or temporary phenomena in signal processing and circuit theory that are almost localized in the time coordinate in many applications , for example .    in this paper , we propose an integer - type general algorithm for solving these odes , by choosing function spaces and their basis systems appropriately . this method is based on a pair of hilbert spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 with distinct inner products , where the domain of the differential operator @xmath11 is a dense subspace of @xmath3 and its range is a subspace of @xmath12 . under appropriate choice of these spaces and their basis systems which will be presented in this paper ,",
    "a differential equation can be expressed by band - diagonal - type simultaneous linear equations , and all the ` matrix elements ' are rational-(complex-)valued . moreover , under the same choice , all the basis functions are rational functions .",
    "in addition , from the properties of the basis functions used , this method has a somewhat similar feature to power series expansions about nonsingular points or regular singular points , in the sense that the solution can be expanded as linear combinations of the powers of a rational function of @xmath13 with rational coefficients . from another point of view , this method is closely related to the laurent expansion and hyperfunctions in complex analysis and to the fourier series , under some changes of variable .",
    "therefore , this method has a ` semi - analytical ' character and it can be discussed from the standpoint of mathematical analysis , though it is a kind of numerical method .",
    "since it is difficult to apply analytical methods to general higher - order linear differential equations , various kinds of numerical methods have been proposed .",
    "one group is based on the discretization of coordinate or on the differences or on the relations between adjacent lattice points ( runge - kutta methods , for example ) .",
    "another group is based on finite - dimensional subspaces of an infinite - dimensional function space , such as the collocation method , the ritz - galerkin method and the petrov - galerkin method  @xcite  @xcite , for example . in this group , many kinds of finite element methods  @xcite  @xcite have been proposed and used widely and efficiently in many fields .",
    "these methods construct subspaces spanned by finite elements with very localized compact supports .",
    "in addition , this group contains a subgroup which uses subspaces spanned by _ globally smooth _ basis functions  @xcite such as the hermite functions .",
    "the method to be proposed in this paper is similar to the latter subgroup in the sense that it is based on the finite - dimensional subspaces spanned by global smooth basis functions .",
    "the proposed method is different from ritz - galerkin method , in that the function space @xmath4 is different from @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is wider than @xmath3 in the proposed method . here",
    ", remember that the function space @xmath3 corresponds to the domain of the differential operator @xmath11 and the function space @xmath4 does to the range of @xmath14 .",
    "the choice of different function spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 may be possible even for petrov - galerkin method .",
    "however , the method proposed here is quite different from the usual ` standard truncation methods ' or ` projection methods ' such as the ritz - galerkin and petrov - galerkin methods , in respect of the following point :    although the ritz - galerkin and petrov - galerkin methods are based on the solutions of simultaneous linear equations with a square matrix truncated within a finite dimension , the method proposed here is based on finite - dimensional truncations of the exact solutions of the _ infinite - dimensional _ simultaneous linear equations .",
    "there is a possibility that our numerical solution coincides exactly with the orthogonal projection of the true solution to the finite - dimensional subspace , whatever its dimension may be , and we have already had some numerical examples where this perfect coincidence occurs really  @xcite . in order to realize this direction ,",
    "we solve simultaneous linear equations with a non - square - type band - diagonal matrix , in which its column is larger than its row . since the solution is not unique because this non - square - type band - diagonal matrix has a non - trivial kernel , we have to extract one solution among the above solutions . in order to resolve this problem ,",
    "we extract one solution among them using a novel method , which will be explained in the latter part of this introduction .",
    "further , this matrix elements do not change when the dimension of the subspace increases .",
    "hence the proposed method provides a recursive algorithm with no round - off errors up to an arbitrary dimension for the vectors of the space of exact solutions of the infinite - dimensional simultaneous linear equations .",
    "the method to be proposed has five advantages other than the integer - type property mentioned above , as follows ; ( 1 ) especially when the ode has no singular point or when the ode belongs to the fuchsian class even if it has singular points , this method can determine the structure itself of the function space of solutions in @xmath3 of the differential equation , directly from the numerical results .",
    "( 2 ) another advantage is that the convergence of the error to @xmath15 is guaranteed as the dimension of the subspace tends to infinity , and an upper bound of the error can be given for the finite - dimensional case .",
    "( 3 ) moreover , it does not require any calculation of large matrices ( inverse matrix , eigenvector , etc . ) for solving our simultaneous linear equations .",
    "( 4 ) another strong point is that the basis functions of @xmath3 are smooth sinusoidal - like wavepackets with spindle - shaped envelopes , which are suitable for the expansion of various kind of ` natural ' functions decaying as @xmath16 . in this sense , the basis functions contain both global and local information .",
    "( 5 ) another strong point is that this method requires a small amount of calculations for obtaining high - accuracy solutions .",
    "for example , when the coefficients in the expansion of a true solution by the basis functions decay exponentially , the amount of calculations required by this method is almost proportional asymptotically to the cube of the number of required significant digits .    in this paper",
    ", we will show the validity of the band - diagonal matrix representation , i.e. , we will show that the square - summable solutions of the simultaneous linear equations according to the band - diagonal matrix always correspond to true solutions of the ode except at the singular points of the ode .",
    "especially , when the ode has no singular point , we will show the one - to - one correspondence between the true solutions in @xmath3 of the differential equation and the square - summable number sequences satisfying the simultaneous linear equations represented by the band - diagonal matrix .",
    "the larger part of its proofs is based mainly on functional analysis .",
    "similar one - to - one correspondence can be proved for the cases of the fuchsian class by a modification even if the ode has singular points . however , the presented method has a pitfall based on finite - dimensional truncations of the exact solutions of the infinite - dimensional simultaneous linear equations .",
    "this pitfall is due to the non - uniqueness of non - square - summable solutions of the simultaneous linear equations because the number of linearly independent solutions of the simultaneous linear equation is not smaller than the bandwidth whereas the number of linearly independent solutions of the differential equations is not greater than its order @xmath17 .",
    "that is , there are solutions which do not correspond to true solutions of the differential equations , we call these solutions _ extra _ solutions . in order to resolve this problem ,",
    "we propose a method to to remove the extra solutions effectively .",
    "this method is based on quasi - minimization of the ratio between a norm sensitive to divergence and another norm insensitive to divergence .",
    "this quasi - minimization guarantees the convergence to @xmath15 of the error in the numerical results ; the accuracy of the numerical results is sufficiently high , even for finite dimensions .    for minimization of the ratio between two quadratic forms ,",
    "the usual method is based on the eigenspace of the matrix @xmath18 with the two corresponding inner - product - matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , it is difficult to apply this method to the above problem , due to round - off errors , because these inner - product matrices are usually very close to a singular matrix with rank @xmath21 .",
    "however , in this paper , we propose an alternative integer - type method for quasi - minimization , which does not require as much calculation as the usual method .",
    "this method is based on a kind of quasi - orthogonalization of integer - valued vectors , which is realized by an idea that is conceptually between the gram - schmidt process and the euclidean algorithm .",
    "an integer - type recursive algorithm similar to the proposed one may be applied also to the petrov - galerkin method , in order to calculate the head and intermediate rows of solution vectors of the system of simultaneous linear equations described by a large - dimensional band - diagonal square matrix . however , in this case , we have to calculate new linear combinations of solution vectors satisfying the final constraints ( linear equations in the bottom rows ) . for this calculation",
    ", we can solve another system of simultaneous linear equations , which is described by another square matrix whose dimension is half a band width .",
    "however , this matrix is usually very close to a singular matrix of rank 1 .",
    "moreover , the elements in the bottom rows of the solution vectors are rational numbers whose numerators and denominators are huge integers .",
    "therefore , this type of petrov - galerkin method requires a much larger amount of calculations than the proposed method based on non - square matrix and integer - type quasi - orthogonalization .",
    ".difference from galerkin methods for norm - finite solutions ( without initial conditions ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tbl:6.1 ]    another example is weber s differential equation ( which is equivalent to the schrdinger equation for a harmonic oscillator  @xcite ) @xmath22 as is well known , for @xmath23 , the space of solutions in @xmath24 is    @xmath25 , which is a subspace of @xmath26 for any @xmath27 . for this example , convergence is very rapid , and we will report its accuracy by showing within how many digits the ratio between two coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the expansion @xmath30 coincides with the true ratio .",
    "for example , in table [ tbl:6.1 ] , we show the results of the ratio @xmath31 for the case with @xmath32 , @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where the true ratio is obtained analytically ( not numerically ) by means of the computer algebra software package  methematica \" .",
    "similar accuracy is observed for other ratios between the coefficients with small @xmath36 and @xmath37 . with @xmath38",
    ", we obtained a result where it coincided with the true value up to @xmath39 digits . in figure",
    "[ fig : ho ] , we plot how the number of significant digits of this ratio depends on @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , we found that the rational ratios obtained in this case have almost a ` full precision ' , because the proportion @xmath41 almost equals @xmath21 for @xmath42 as is shown in figure [ fig : rho ] .",
    "( in this case , the ratio @xmath43 has no imaginary part due to a symmetry . )",

    "ode ( [ eqn : ex_2 ] ) is modified to @xmath50 the results for this ode with @xmath32 , @xmath51 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given in fig [ fig : ho30 ] . in this case , with @xmath52 , the number of the significant digits between two coefficients is infinite ( i.e. perfectly exact ratio is obtained ) when the true ratio is rational which occurs for the ratio among @xmath53 , and it is very large even when the true ratio is irrational . for example , for the ratio @xmath54 ( which is irrational ) , the ratio obtained numerically by the proposed method coincides within 8783 digits to the true ratio when @xmath55 . moreover , for the ratio between the values of the solution function at two points @xmath56 , there the numerical result by the proposed method coincides within 2599 digits to the true ratio .",
    "( the number of significant digits seems to be proportional to @xmath57 empirically in the case when @xmath40 is sufficiently large . ) as for the ratio defined in ( [ eqn : def_ratio_digits ] ) , the numerical results by the proposed method give almost a ` full precision ' al so in this case , which is shown in fig [ fig : rho30 ] .",
    "there results show evidently how accurate the proposed method is .",
    "next , we give examples in fuchsian class where @xmath58 has zero points . here , we show how numerical results converge to true solutions in such a case where the true solutions are written with the associate legendre function . in this case",

    "as is well known , there are three intervals @xmath62 , @xmath59 and @xmath63 within which smooth solutions are defined , because the coefficient function @xmath64 of the highest order term has two zero points @xmath65 . however , none of the solutions defined in the intervals @xmath62 and @xmath63 is square - integrable , and hence the space of solutions in @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) is the one - dimensional space @xmath68}(x)\\cdot   ( 1-x^2)^\\frac{\\mu}{2 } l_\\nu^\\mu ( x ) \\ ,",

    "exact solutions can be written by the ( associate ) laguerre functions @xmath76 within the interval @xmath77 , we have already had similar results to this , where the obtained numerical solutions are almost zero for @xmath78 .",

    "( the same change of variable has been used for a description of analytic unit quadrature signals with nonlinear phase  @xcite  @xcite . )",
    "the function @xmath82 is identical to the cauchy wavelet  @xcite used for continuous wavelet transformation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , when @xmath83 is even , @xmath84 is closely related to the number state associated with @xmath85 in a representation of @xmath85 which can be formulated by adding a third generator to the two generators of the @xmath86 group  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm proposed in this paper is easily extended to linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations with inhomogeneous terms in @xmath12 .",
    "this extension only requires substitution of the right hand side @xmath15 of the simultaneous linear equations @xmath87 @xmath88 by the @xmath89-inner - products between the inhomogeneous term and the basis function @xmath90 .",
    "we have already proved that the proposed method can be applied for eigenfunction problems of self - adjoint operators with given eigenvalues , under some conditions , which will be reported in another paper  @xcite . in order to apply the proposed method to the eigenvalue - eigenvector problem for a linear operator",
    ", we must have a method to obtain the eigenvalues , because the eigenvalue is regarded as a fixed parameter of the characteristic equation in the proposed method . in the case of discrete eigenvalues ,",
    "if an eigenvalue is not exact , the function satisfying the characteristic equation does not belong to @xmath3 , and hence its corresponding vector is not square - summable .",
    "however , when we truncate the algorithm within a finite number of dimensions , the square - summability is not distinguishable .",
    "the number sequence obtained by our method for an approximate eigenvalue decays within a finite number of dimensions as rapidly as the number sequence corresponding to the true eigenvector .",
    "as the approximation of the eigenvalue is better , it decays for more dimensions .",
    "from this fact , we can propose a method to find the eigenvalue by observing the location of the bottom of the valley of the ratio @xmath91 .",
    "here we give an example of such valleys in figure [ fig : val ] . in this example , we are successful to separate two eigenvalues which are very contiguous by the ` tunnel effect ' , for a schrdinger equation with quantum - double - well - type potential function .",
    "( 100,155 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 100,155 ) ( 0,0 )    moreover , we have already invented another faster and more effective method for finding eigenvalues in a very high accuracy , based on a more analytical idea .",
    "this idea utilizes linear interpolations by means of some indices almost linear to the deviation of the eigenvalue ( see fig.[fig : lin ] ) which are calculated directly from numerical results .",
    "a similar idea to the proposed method can be applied to linear partial differential equations . however , the number of linearly independent solutions of simultaneous linear equations is not fixed but increasing as @xmath40 increases for linear partial differential equations , while it is fixed at @xmath92 for linear ordinary differential equations . therefore , we have to estimate how much memory and how many calculations would be required .",
    "this algorithm has the possibility of extension to nonlinear differential equations because of the following properties : > from the definition of @xmath93 , the relation @xmath94 holds . the combination of this fact and lemma [ lemma : expansion - recursion ] results in the fact that the product @xmath95 can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath96 .",
    "similarly , the product of more than three basis functions can be written as a linear combination of finite numbers of the same basis functions .",
    "if the nonlinearity is weak , we can apply the proposed method to the successive approximation method for nonlinear differential equations , because of this property .",
    "however , for the nonlinear case , it is more difficult to find a proof of convergence and an upper bound for errors , than it is for the linear case .",
    "we have proposed an integer - type algorithm which can determine accurately a basis system for the space of solutions in @xmath3 of the @xmath17-th order ode @xmath97 with polynomials or rational functions for the coefficient functions @xmath6 @xmath98 under certain conditions .",
    "the basic structure of this algorithm has been shown in a more general framework and several conditions have been stated for the validity of this structure .",
    "next , we have provided choices for the spaces and their basis systems satisfying these conditions , with detailed checks of these conditions .",
