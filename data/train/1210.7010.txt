    "over the past decade , relativistic hydrodynamics has established itself as an indispensable component in modeling the collective dynamics of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the properties of the qgp , in particular its shear viscosity , can be deduced by studying its efficiency of converting initial geometric anisotropies into final anisotropic flows . because of this , measurements of collective flow anisotropies @xmath0 ( initially the elliptic flow @xmath1 , more recently higher - order harmonic flows @xmath2 @xcite ) have generated strong interest and fertilized the study of initial geometry fluctuations and their dynamical consequences @xcite .",
    "the tool of choice for such studies is event - by - event hydrodynamics @xcite where each fluctuating initial density profile is evolved separately , followed by taking an average over the event ensemble to compute @xmath3-spectra , anisotropic flow coefficients and two - particle correlations in the final state which can then be compared with experimental data . due to the limited number of final state particles in each event , these observables can be measured with good statistical precision only as ensemble averages . due to algorithmic progress over the last few years",
    ", the hydrodynamic evolution part is no longer the bottleneck in such event - by - event studies ; at least for ( 2 + 1)-dimensional simulations ( which assume longitudinal boost - invariance ) the largest fraction of the computer time is spent converting the hydrodynamic output into final particle distributions , either on a  switching surface \" between a macroscopic hydrodynamic description of the qgp fluid and a microscopic kinetic evolution of the dilute late hadronic rescattering stage @xcite , or on a ",
    "kinetic decoupling \" surface marking the transition from a strongly coupled fluid directly to a non - interacting gas of free - streaming hadrons .",
    "the high numerical cost of this  hydro - to - particle conversion \" process results from the large number of unstable hadron resonances that need to be included and whose post - freeze - out decays ( mostly due to strong - interaction processes , although for some comparisons with experimental data that have not been corrected @xcite for weak - decay feed - down , weak and electromagnetic decays must also be considered ) modify the finally observed particle distributions .",
    "the hydro - to - hadron conversion algorithm is based on the cooper - frye formula @xcite which expresses the final hadron momentum distribution as an integral of the local equilibrium ( for ideal fluid dynamics ) or slightly off - equilibrium ( in viscous fluids ) distribution function for the particle species in question over the conversion surface .",
    "contributions to the spectra of experimentally measured _ stable _",
    "particles from the strong decays of unstable resonances are then calculated from the single - particle spectra for the resonances @xcite .",
    "this requires the calculation of the directly emitted ( `` thermal '' ) particle momentum distributions for all @xmath4 hadron species with mass typically up to 2 gev via cooper - frye integrals , followed by the evaluation of the phase - space integrals @xcite for all contributing decay channels . on a typical personal computer with a single - core cpu",
    "this calculation takes presently about 2 - 3 hours , compared to 10 - 15 minutes for the preceding hydrodynamic evolution with , say , the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional viscous fluid code vish2 + 1 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5gev cutoff in resonance mass is dictated by requiring convergence of the relative particle yields of the measured hadronic final state after all unstable resonances have been allowed to decay .",
    "( the pion yields are especially sensitive to resonance feeddown . )",
    "experimental evidence points to chemical decoupling at a temperature of @xmath6mev , i.e. close to the ( pseudo)critical temperature for the quark - hadron phase transition @xcite ; at this temperature , only resonances with masses above 2gev are sufficiently strongly boltzmann - suppressed that their decay contributions to stable particle yields can be safely ignored .    here",
    "we show that for an accurate determination of the pion and proton anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath0 a much smaller number of resonances needs to be taken into account than for the hadron yields , and that even the shape of the azimuthally averaged pion and proton transverse momentum spectra can be reliably determined by accounting for only a small subset of the @xmath4 resonance species mentioned above .",
    "these are the observables needed for an extraction of the qgp shear viscosity from heavy - ion collision experiments @xcite . by rearranging the resonance decay table in order of decreasing importance for the calculation of @xmath3-spectra and @xmath0 coefficients instead of increasing mass , good convergence for these observables",
    "can be achieved with a significantly reduced set of only about 20 - 30 resonances .",
    "this speeds up the computation by a factor of 10  a significant gain in efficiency for the iterative determination of the qgp shear viscosity .",
    "the analysis presented here uses final states generated with the @xmath7-dimensional boost - invariant viscous hydrodynamic code vish2 + 1 for 200@xmath8gev au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and for 2.76@xmath8tev pb+pb collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at various collision centralities , with previously determined @xcite hydrodynamic input parameters .",
    "we find very similar results at both collision energies and therefore show here only plots for lhc collisions .",
    "since the decay contributions from different resonances to the mentioned observables depend only on their decay channels and transverse momentum distributions , we expect little sensitivity to the assumption of longitudinal boost - invariance implicit in our approach and expect our reordered resonance decay tables to perform equally well for both @xmath9-d and @xmath10-d hydrodynamic simulations , and for a wide range of input parameters ( such as qgp viscosity , thermalization time , initial entropy and energy density , etc . ) .",
    "the momentum distributions of directly emitted ( `` thermal '' ) resonances of species @xmath11 are computed from the cooper - frye formula @xcite : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the hydro - to - hadron conversion hypersurface , @xmath14 its surface normal vector , @xmath15 $ ] is the bose or fermi thermal equilibrium distribution function , and @xmath16 accounts for viscous corrections ( driven by the viscous pressure tensor @xmath17 on the conversion surface ) of the local phase - space distribution along @xmath13 .",
    "we assume the quadratic form @xmath18 .",
    "resonance decays increase the total yields of the stable hadrons and change their momentum distributions . for kinematic reasons ,",
    "most of the light decay daughters have low transverse momenta , thus modifying the shape of light stable hadrons ( pions , kaons ) particle spectra mostly in the region @xmath19gev @xcite .",
    "we denote the total decay contribution to the momentum distribution of stable hadron species @xmath11 by @xmath20 , and the total spectrum ( obtained by adding this to the thermally emitted spectrum @xmath21 ) by @xmath22 .",
    "( we here include only strong and electromagnetic decays . ) the @xmath23-integrated total yield @xmath24 of decay products of species @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , where the sum is over resonances @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the effective branching ratio ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) below ) for the decay @xmath29 .",
    "the contribution to @xmath25 from a particular resonance @xmath27 is not only influenced by its mass ( through the boltzmann suppression factor @xmath30 ) , but also by its spin degeneracy factor @xmath31 and its branching ratio @xmath28 into the decay channel that feeds stable particle species @xmath11 .",
    "for each stable hadron species @xmath11 it is therefore a different set of resonances that makes the most important contributions .",
    "our goal is to order the resonances in decreasing order of importance , for each stable particle species @xmath11 .",
    "we here assume that the conversion surface has constant temperature @xmath32 .",
    "the different hadron resonances have @xmath32-dependent non - equilibrium fugacities @xmath33 that ensure constant stable particle ratios equal to their chemical equilibrium values at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , independent of the hydro - to - hadron conversion temperature @xmath32 . while the actual fractions contributed by each resonance to the stable particle yields",
    "depend on @xmath32 , the ordering of these fractions is largely @xmath32-independent .",
    "we start from the resonance table in the azhydro package , which includes @xmath36 species of hadrons ( counting different isospin states such as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 as separate species ) with rest masses up to @xmath40 gev . after fixing the value of @xmath32",
    "we look up the non - equilibrium fugacity @xmath33 for each of these 319 species from the eos s95p - pce tables constructed in ref .  @xcite . for each stable particle species @xmath11",
    "we then generate an ordered list of resonances @xmath27 that can decay directly into @xmath11 .",
    "note that in this ordering we account not only for direct decay contribution but also for multi - step decay cascades , where @xmath27 first decays into an unstable resonance @xmath41 which further decays ( directly or through more intermediate steps ) into the stable species @xmath11 .",
    "table [ tab:1 ] shows the beginning of this contribution table for positively charged pions , for a conversion temperature @xmath42mev .",
