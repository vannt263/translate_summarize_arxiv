    "in the last years ground - based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) opened a previously inaccessible window for the study of astrophysical sources of @xmath1 radiation in the vhe regime .",
    "the detection of more than 50 galactic vhe @xmath1-ray emitters during the galactic plane scan performed by the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration between 2004 and 2007 @xcite decupled the number of known vhe @xmath1-ray sources and hence established a new field in astronomy .",
    "the earth s atmosphere is opaque to vhe photons , which initiate electromagnetic particle cascades ( extensive air showers , eas ) in the atmosphere .",
    "the highly relativistic charged particles in the cascade emit cherenkov light which can be imaged via a large mirror onto a fine - grained camera . from the shower image",
    "one can reconstruct the arrival direction of the primary @xmath1-ray and calculate its energy using the number of collected cherenkov photons and the directional information .",
    "one of the big advantages of iacts is their enormous effective detector area .",
    "modern instruments reach @xmath2 which is five orders of magnitude larger than what is typically achieved with satellite - based instruments like egret or fermi lat . while the latter benefit from quasi background free observations , cherenkov telescopes have to deal with a vast number of hadronic cosmic - ray background events .",
    "the capability to suppress these against the @xmath1-rays associated with astrophysical sources is one of the key aspects that determines the sensitivity of iacts .    to increase the sensitivity of ground - based vhe @xmath1-ray telescope systems beyond what is obtained with state - of - the - art instruments like h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , magic @xcite , veritas @xcite or cangaroo - iii @xcite larger arrays are needed , as e.g. studied by the cta @xcite and agis @xcite consortia .",
    "still , for the existing instruments , increased background reduction can improve the sensitivity considerably .",
    "with respect to the classical - robust but less sensitive - _ hillas approach _",
    "@xcite , which parametrises the 2-dimensional elliptical shape of the recorded images for reconstruction and selection of @xmath1-ray like events , sensitivity can be increased by e.g. analysis methods which compare the detected images with a 3-dimensional photosphere model of the eas ( e.g. _ 3d model analysis _",
    ", introduced by lemoine - goumard @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the applicability of multivariate analysis techniques - ray or a cosmic ray . ] like random forests @xcite in ground - based vhe astronomy has recently been demonstrated @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we follow the latter approach and discuss the application of the _ boosted decision trees _ ( bdt ) method , provided by the tmva package @xcite , to data obtained by the h.e.s.s .",
    "the stability of the technique and its capabilities to improve @xmath1/hadron separation compared to the h.e.s.s .",
    "standard analysis are demonstrated . after a brief description of the method ( chapter [ section : bdt ] ) and an introduction of the training and evaluation of the bdt method with events recorded by the h.e.s.s .",
    "experiment in chapter [ section : application ] , the application of bdt to h.e.s.s .",
    "data is discussed ( chapter [ section : comparison ] ) .",
    "finally , performance and sensitivity evaluated using monte - carlo simulations and background data are presented ( chapter [ section : tests ] ) .",
    "machine learning algorithms like neural networks ( nns ) , likelihood estimators or fisher discriminants are basically extensions of simple cut - based analysis techniques to multivariate algorithms .",
    "they are widely used in natural sciences for classification of events of different type which are described by a set of input parameters . beyond the aforementioned techniques the miniboone @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations recently utilised the bdt method for particle identification in high energy physics , and bailey @xcite used it for supernova searches in optical astronomy .",
    "one of the main advantages of nns and bdt compared to likelihood classifiers or fisher discriminants is the consideration of nonlinear correlations between input parameters .",
    "furthermore , the bdt method effectively ignores parameters without separation power whereas nns could suffer from those , resulting in a degraded separation .",
    "decision trees @xcite can be represented by a two dimensional structure like the one sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : method ] . by applying , at each branching , a binary split criterion ( passed or failed ) on one of the characterising input parameters they classify events of unknown type as signal - like or background - like .",
    "the determination of these criteria is also referred to as _ training _ of a decision tree , and is performed with a training set consisting of events of known type . to circumvent a drawback of single decision trees , namely the instability against statistical fluctuations in the training event set ,",
    "one extends the single decision tree to a _",
    "forest _ of decision trees , which differ in the binary split criteria .",
    "a weighted mean vote of the classification of all single trees in the forest stabilises the response of the classifier and improves its performance .",
    "this vote is the output of the bdt and describes the signal- or background - likeliness of an event . in this work",
    "it is referred to as the @xmath3 variable .",
    "the forest of trees is obtained by a process called `` boosting '' , starting from an initial single tree .",
    "= ( @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6 ) , undergoes at each node a binary split criterion ( passed or failed ) on one of its parameters until it ends up in a _",
    "leaf_. this leaf marks it as signal ( s ) or background ( b ) . ]",
    "the training or building of a decision tree is the process that finds the appropriate splitting criterion for each node using a training sample , @xmath7 , of events of known type .",
    "the training sample is composed of a signal training sample , @xmath8 , and a background training sample , @xmath9 , which consist of @xmath10 signal and @xmath11 background events , respectively .",
    "each event in the training set is characterised by a weighting factor @xmath12 and a set of input parameters , @xmath13 . to build a decision tree from such a training sample",
    "the following steps are performed :    * the training samples are normalised in such a way that all signal events have the same weight , @xmath14 , and all background events have the same weight @xmath15 .",
    "* tree building starts at the root node ( top node in fig .",
    "[ fig : method ] ) , where one finds the variable and split value that provides the best separation of signal and background events . according to this splitting criterion ,",
    "@xmath7 is divided into two subsets of events that either pass or fail this criterion .",
    "each subset is fed into a child node where again the cut parameter which separates best signal and background events is determined . *",
    "this procedure is applied recursively until further splitting would not increase the separation , or a preassigned minimum number of events is reached . according to the majority of signal and background events , the last - grown nodes ( which are called leaves ) are assigned signal ( s ) or background ( b ) type , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : method ] ) .",
    "single decision trees are sensitive to statistical fluctuations in the training sample , hence a boosting procedure is applied which results in a forest of trees and thus increases the stability of the method . in this procedure ,",
    "events that got misclassified in the building of the previous tree are multiplied with a _ boost weight _ ,",
    "@xmath16 , thereby getting a higher weight in the training of the next tree .",
    "hence , the boosting is applied to all trees except for the first one .",
    "this method is known as _ adaboost _ or adaptive boost @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 is calculated from the fraction of misclassified events in all leaves , @xmath17 :    @xmath18    after having applied @xmath16 to each misclassified event , renormalisation of the training samples retains the sum of weights of all events in a decision tree constant .      in this work we use the bdt method provided by the tmva package .",
    "the decision tree settings are mostly default values , which have been optimised and tested by the tmva developers .",
    "these parameters guarantee a fast training procedure and a stable response of the classifier and are marked with a * in the following .    *",
    "the number of trees was chosen to be 200 * , which is a compromise between separation performance and processing power .",
    "varying this value in a broad range does not significantly change the presented results . *",
    "the _ gini index * _ was used as separation type .",
    "it calculates the inequality between signal and background distributions for each value to find the best cut .",
    "other separation types were tested and found to achieve similar results .",
    "* splitting was stopped when the number of events in a node fell below ( @xmath10 + @xmath11 ) / ( 10 @xmath19 ) * , taking into account the training statistics and the number of training parameters .",
    "typical numbers are between 100 and 1000 for the smallest and largest data set , respectively . *",
    "the number of steps used to scan the parameter space for the best splitting criterion was increased from 20 to 100 to adequately cover training parameters with a large range of values .",
    "having discussed the basic bdt - functioning and details of the growing procedure in the last chapter , this section deals with the training and evaluation of the bdt method .",
    "after an introduction of the training parameters used in this work , the properties of the signal- and background training sample are discussed . finally , tests of the classifiers response are presented .",
    "the recorded eas images contain pixels which mainly store photons from the night sky background ( nsb ) .",
    "they are removed in an image cleaning procedure @xcite for the further image analysis . only pixels with an intensity of 5 p.e . and a neighbouring pixel with more than 10 p.e .",
    "( and vice versa ) are kept , thereby just selecting pixels which contain cherenkov photons originating from the eas .    to classify the recorded air - shower events as of either signal- or background type ,",
    "a set of training parameters has been derived using information from the eas images .",
    "the training parameters are based on the _ hillas parameters _",
    "@xcite which are calculated using the second moments of the cleaned shower images . of these",
    ", the width , length , and total intensity ( also called _ image size _ ) of the ellipse are used for classification .",
    "compared to cosmic - ray induced showers , which in general exhibit a rather irregular shape , showers produced by @xmath1-rays ( or electrons ) have an elliptical , quite regular structure .",
    "the hillas parameters inherently store information about the shape of the shower , and can therefore be used to discriminate between cosmic - ray and @xmath1-ray primaries . furthermore",
    ", an event recorded by multiple telescopes is better constrained . to be independent of the number of participating telescopes ( hereafter called _ multiplicity _ ) , the hillas parameters of individual telescopes are averaged .",
    "the same is true for all the bdt training parameters , presented in the following :    * one type of training parameters is based on the _ mean reduced scaled width _ approach introduced by aharonian @xcite . for an image with a given size and reconstructed impact distance the mean expected width for a @xmath1-ray @xmath20 as obtained from @xmath1-ray simulations",
    "is compared to the measured width @xmath21 .",
    "the _ scaled width _ for telescope @xmath22 is then defined as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the spread of the expected width .",
    "the mean reduced scaled width ( mrsw ) can then be calculated as the average scw over all telescopes : + @xmath25 + taking into account the accuracy of the @xmath1-ray simulations by introducing a weighting factor @xmath12 , defined as @xmath26",
    ". + similarly , the _ mean reduced scaled length _",
    "( mrsl ) is calculated . by comparing the measured width and length of the image with the prediction for an hadronic event ,- ray contamination as cosmic - ray background ( also referred to as _ off - events _ ) ] two additional training parameters ,",
    "the _ mean reduced scaled width off _ ( mrswo ) and _ mean reduced scaled length off _ ( mrslo ) , are computed . *",
    "another parameter addresses the different interaction lengths of photons and hadronic cosmic - rays in the atmosphere .",
    "it is expressed as the depth of the shower maximum x@xmath27 and reconstructed from the recorded shower images .",
    "also this parameter is calculated as a weighted mean value over all participating telescopes .",
    "* because of their irregular structure , the energy of hadron - induced showers may be reconstructed differently for telescopes seeing the shower from different directions .",
    "the @xmath28e / e parameter , calculated as the averaged spread in energy reconstruction between the triggered telescopes , adds additional separation power to the bdt classification .    for illustration , fig .",
    "[ fig : trainpar ] shows all training parameter distributions for events with zenith angles around 20@xmath29 and energies 0.5  tev @xmath30 e @xmath30 1.0  tev .",
    "the training set used for building the bdt consists of monte - carlo simulations of @xmath1-rays as signal events , and off - events as cosmic ray background .",
    "the @xmath1-rays are simulated as resulting from a point source , at a fixed distance ( offset ) of 0.5@xmath29 from the camera centre , and follow an energy distribution dn / de @xmath31 e@xmath32 with index @xmath33 = 2.0 . since cosmic - rays reach the earth isotropically , the off - events are homogeneously distributed over the field of view of the camera .",
    "a cut on the minimum image size of 80 p.e . and the maximum distance between the centre - of - gravity ( @xmath34 ) of the hillas ellipse and the camera centre ( to reduce effects of image truncation ) was applied to the training sample .",
    "this is also referred to as _ pre - selection _ and used to exclude poorly reconstructed events from the training process .",
    "the aim of a bdt classification is a stable @xmath1/hadron separation over the whole dynamical range of the telescope system , which comprises the accessible energy range as well as the observational conditions ( e.g. the zenith angle of the observation ) . since the shower shape changes with the primary particle energy and its zenith angle , the distributions of some of the input parameters and consequently the response of the classifier changes .",
    "as opposed to the mean reduced scaled parameters which by construction are independent of event energy and zenith angle , the depth of the shower maximum and the uncertainty in the energy estimation do depend on both these quantities .",
    "this characteristic requires a training of the bdt in energy- and zenith angle bands . the energy range accessible for h.e.s.s .",
    "( from @xmath31100  gev to @xmath31100  tev ) was divided into six bands , based on the energy reconstructed assuming a @xmath1-ray hypothesis , such that for each of seven zenith angle bands ( from 0@xmath35 to 60@xmath35 ) the input parameter distributions do not change significantly , and a sufficient number of events for the training process was available .",
    "a summary of the training statistics in the energy- and zenith angle bands can be found in table [ table : training ] . the decreasing number of training events with increasing energy and/or zenith angle is a direct consequence of the energy spectra of the training sample and the increased energy threshold of the h.e.s.s .",

    "the spectrum obtained for the application of the @xmath3 std - cuts and the published differential flux @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "an excellent agreement between both results further consolidates the applicability of the bdt approach for the analysis of vhe @xmath1-ray sources .",
    "additional spectral tests with sources of different spectral shape , flux level or source extensions were performed .",

    "having shown the applicability of the bdt classification under different observational conditions and for the spectral analysis , the performance and sensitivity of bdt is studied on the basis of @xmath1-ray simulations and off - events .",
    "an appropriate parameter to quantify the quality of analysis cuts is the _ quality factor q _ ( e.g. @xcite ) , defined as :    @xmath36 @xmath37 where the cut efficiency @xmath38 is defined as the number of events that pass certain cuts @xmath39 divided by the number of events before cuts @xmath40 .",
    "[ fig : zenith ] shows the development of _",
    "q@xmath41 / q@xmath42 _ as a function of zenith angle and energy for the @xmath3 std- and hard - cuts and the std- and hard - cuts after application of the pre - selection and the image shape selection . the pre - selection consist of the corresponding image size cuts and a cut on the distance between the @xmath34 of the shower image and the camera centre to avoid truncated images at the camera edge .",
    "the image shape cuts comprehend cuts on @xmath3 and mrsw , mrsl , respectively ( see table [ table : cuts ] and [ table : effzeta ] for further information ) .",
    "the training in energy- and zenith angle bands leads to a stable improvement in separation power for the bdt method and makes the zenith- and energy - dependent cuts on @xmath3 well suited for this kind of analysis . especially at energies below a few hundred gev and energies above a few tev",
    "the improvement in q for hard- and std - spectrum sources is remarkable . as a result of the training with @xmath1-rays simulated at a fixed offset of 0.5@xmath35 , the performance of the @xmath3 cuts",
    "is reduced for events with larger offsets ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "however , a training in offset bands resulted in steps in selection efficiency across the field of view and in the description of the camera acceptance , and is therefore not employed .",
    "the optimised @xmath3 cuts ( introduced in section [ subsection : spectralanalysis ] and table [ table : cuts ] ) are applied to @xmath1-ray simulations and off - events , and their sensitivity for strong , std - spectrum and weak , hard - spectrum sources was calculated . to disentangle the performance improvement due to the information stored in the additional parameters and due to the treatment of non - linear correlations by the bdt method , the sensitivity for optimised",
    "_ box cuts _ on all training parameters is also shown .",
    "these box cuts are a set of one - dimensional cuts on each training parameter which are all optimised simultaneously to obtain the best separation between signal and background .",

    "standard analysis , for configuration standard and hard , respectively .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] , that box cuts add just little to the total separation gain , since they ignore non - linear correlations in the six training parameters .    since the x@xmath27 parameter contributes especially at low energies to the classification ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : importance ] for comparison ) , and cuts optimised for hard - spectrum sources tend to reject low - energy events , the performance improvement of the @xmath3 hard - cuts is only 20% compared to the h.e.s.s .",
    "hard - cuts . nevertheless , the improvement is stable over a wide range of fluxes .",
    "one possibility to further improve the bdt performance for hard - spectrum sources is to find the best match between size cut applied to select the training sample ( see section [ subsection : trainingsample ] for comparison ) and size cut optimised for a given source type in an alternating process .",
