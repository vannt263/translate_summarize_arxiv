    "in this talk i will describe some recent work together with michael dinsdale concerning the relative size of non - perturbative power corrections for qcd event shape observables @xcite . for @xmath1 event shape _ means _",
    "the delphi collaboration have found in a recent analysis that , if the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative corrections are evaluated using the method of effective charges @xcite , then one can obtain excellent fits to data without including any power corrections @xcite .",
    "in contrast fits based on the use of standard fixed - order perturbation theory in the @xmath2 scheme with a physical choice of renormalization scale equal to the c.m .",
    "energy , require additional power corrections @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "power corrections of this size are also predicted in a model based on an infrared finite coupling @xcite , which is able to fit the data reasonably well in terms of a single parameter . given the delphi",
    "result it is interesting to consider how to extend the method of effective charges to event shape _",
    "distributions _ rather than means . +",
    "consider an @xmath1 observable @xmath5 , e.g. an event shape observable- thrust or heavy - jet mass , @xmath6 being the c.m .",
    "@xmath7 here @xmath8 .",
    "normalised with the leading coefficient unity , such an observable is called an _",
    "effective charge_. the couplant @xmath9 satisfies the beta - function equation @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are universal , the higher coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath14 , are rs - dependent and may be used to label the scheme , together with dimensional transmutation parameter @xmath0 @xcite . the _ effective charge _",
    "@xmath15 satisfies the equation @xmath16 this corresponds to the beta - function equation in an rs where the higher - order corrections vanish and @xmath17 , the beta - function coefficients in this scheme are the rs - invariant combinations @xmath18 eq.(3 ) for @xmath19 can be integrated to give @xmath20 + \\int_{0}^{{\\cal{r}}(q)}{dx}\\left[\\frac{b}{\\rho(x)}+\\frac{1}{{x}^{2}(1+cx)}\\right]\\;.\\ ] ] the dimensionful constant @xmath21 arises as a constant of integration .",
    "it is related to the dimensional transmutation parameter @xmath22 by the exact relation , @xmath23 here @xmath24 with @xmath25 , is the nlo perturbative coefficient .",
    "eq.(5 ) can be recast in the form @xmath26 the final factor converts to the standard convention for @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath27 is the _ universal _",
    "function @xmath28 and @xmath29 is @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the nnlo ech rs - invariant . if only a nlo calculation is available , as is the case for @xmath1 jet observables , then @xmath32 , and @xmath33 eq.(10 ) can be used to convert the measured data for the observable @xmath15 into a value of @xmath34 bin - by - bin .",
    "such an analysis was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite for a number of @xmath1 event shape observables , including thrust and heavy jet mass which we shall focus on here . it was found that the fitted @xmath0 values exhibited a clear plateau region , away from the two - jet region , and the region approaching @xmath35 where the nlo thrust distribution vanishes .",
    "the result for 1-thrust corrected for hadronization effects is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "obtained for hadronization corrected 1-thrust data .",
    "@xcite ]    another way of motivating the effective charge approach is the idea of `` complete renormalization group improvement '' ( corgi ) @xcite .",
    "one can write the nlo coefficient @xmath36 as @xmath37 hence one can identify scale - dependent @xmath38-logs and rs - invariant `` physical '' uv @xmath6-logs .",
    "higher coefficients are polynomials in @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 given a nlo calculation of @xmath39 , parts of @xmath41 are `` rg - predictable '' .",
    "one usually chooses @xmath42 then @xmath43 is @xmath6-independent , and so are all the @xmath44 . the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath5 then comes entirely from the rs - dependent coupling @xmath45 .",
    "however , if we insist that @xmath38 is held constant _ independent of @xmath6 _ the only @xmath6-dependence resides in the `` physical '' uv @xmath6-logs in @xmath43 .",
    "asymptotic freedom then arises only if we resum these @xmath6-logs to _ all - orders_. given only a nlo calculation , and assuming for simplicity that that we have a trivial one loop beta - function @xmath46 so that @xmath47 the rg - predictable terms will be @xmath48 summing the geometric progression one obtains @xmath49 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 1/b{\\ln}(q/{\\lambda}_{\\cal{r}})\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath38-logs `` eat themselves '' and one arrives at the nlo ech result @xmath50 . +",
    "as we noted earlier , and as will be discussed by klaus hamacher in his talk @xcite , use of nlo effective charge perturbation theory ( renormalization group invariant ( rgi ) perturbation theory ) leads to excellent fits for @xmath1 event shape _ means _",
    "consistent with zero power corrections , as illustrated in figure 2 . taken from ref.@xcite .     for means of @xmath1 event shape observables taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "the quality of the `` pure rgi '' fits on the right is noteworthy . ]",
    "given this result it would seem worthwhile to extend the effective charge approach to event shape _ distributions_. it is commonly stated that the method of effective charges is inapplicable to exclusive quantities which depend on multiple scales .",
    "however given an observable @xmath51 depending on @xmath52 scales it can always be written as @xmath53 here the @xmath54 are _ dimensionless _ quantities that can be held fixed , allowing the @xmath55 evolution of @xmath15 to be obtained as before . in the 2-jet region for @xmath1 observables large logarithms @xmath56 arise and need to be resummed to all - orders .",
    "event shape distributions for thrust ( @xmath57 ) or heavy - jet mass ( @xmath58 ) contain large kinematical logarithms , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 here @xmath62 , @xmath63 , denote leading logarithms , next - to - leading logarithms , etc . for thrust and heavy - jet mass the distributions _ exponentiate _",
    "@xcite @xmath64 here @xmath65 contains the ll and @xmath66 the nll .",
    "@xmath67 is independent of @xmath68 , and @xmath69 contains terms that vanish as @xmath70 .",
    "it is natural to define an effective charge @xmath71 so that @xmath72 this effective charge will have the expansion @xmath73 here @xmath74 , and the higher coefficients @xmath75 have the structure @xmath76 usually one resums these logarithms to all - orders using the known closed - form expressions for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is taken to be the @xmath80 coupling with a `` physical '' scale choice @xmath25 ( @xmath80ps ) .",
    "instead we want to resum logarithms to all - orders in the @xmath81 function ( ech ) .",
    "the form of the @xmath82 rs - invariants ( eq.(4 ) ) means that the @xmath82 have the structure @xmath83 one can then define all - orders rs - invariant @xmath62 and @xmath63 approximations to @xmath81 , @xmath84 the resummed @xmath85 can then be used to solve for @xmath86 by inserting it in eq.(5 ) .",
    "notice that since @xmath21 involves the _ exact _ value of @xmath87 there is no matching problem as in the standard @xmath2ps approach .",
    "the resummed @xmath88 can be straightforwardly numerically computed using @xmath89 with @xmath79 chosen so that @xmath90 .",
    "the same relation with @xmath91 suffices for @xmath92 , although in this case one needs to remove @xmath93 terms , e.g. an @xmath94 term which would otherwise be included in @xmath31 .",
    "this can be accomplished by numerically taking limits @xmath95 with @xmath96 fixed .",
    "+ as we have noted a crucial feature of the effective charge approach is that it resums to all - orders _ rg - predictable _ pieces of the higher - order coefficients , thus the nlo ech result ( assuming @xmath97 for simplicity ) corresponds to an rs - invariant resummation ( c.f .",
    "eq.(13 ) . )",
    "@xmath98 thus even at fixed - order without any resummation of large logs in @xmath81 a _ partial _ resummation of large logs is automatically performed .",
    "furthermore one might expect that the ll ech result contains already nll pieces of the standard @xmath80ps result .",
    "+    ps . the dotted curve is an unexponentiated nlo ech fit .",
    "delphi data at @xmath99 are plotted .",
    "@xmath100 is assumed . ]",
    "ps coefficient at o(@xmath101 ) `` predicted '' from the ll ech result to the exact result ( diamonds ) .",
    "the triangles show the `` prediction '' from the nlo ech result . ]    in figure 3 we show various nlo approximations .",
    "notice that the solid curve , which corresponds to the exponentiated nlo ech result , is a surprisingly good fit even in the 2-jet region , whereas the dashed curve which is the nlo @xmath2ps result , has a badly misplaced peak .",
    "the all - orders partial resummation of large logs in eq.(15 ) gives a reasonable 2-jet peak .",
    "figure 4 shows that the nll @xmath80ps coefficients `` predicted '' from the ll ech result by re - expanding it in the @xmath2ps coupling are in good agreement with the exact coeffiecients out to o(@xmath102 ) .",
    "we now turn to fits simultaneously extracting @xmath34 and the size of power corrections @xmath3 from the data . to facilitate this we use the result that inclusion of power corrections effectively shifts the event shape distributions , which can be motivated by considering simple models of hadronization , or through a renormalon analysis @xcite .",
    "thus we define @xmath103 this shifted result is then fitted to the data for 1-thrust and heavy jet mass .",
    "@xmath1 data spanning the c.m .",
    "energy range from @xmath104 gev was used ( see @xcite for the complete list of references ) . the resulting fits for 1-thrust and heavy - jet mass",
    "are shown in figures 5 .",
    "and 6 .. + the ech fits for thrust and heavy jet mass show great stability going from nlo to ll to nll , presumably because at each stage a partial resummation of higher logs is automatically performed .",
    "the power corrections required with ech are somewhat smaller than those found with @xmath80ps , but we do not find as dramatic a reduction as delphi find for the means . this may be because their analysis corrects the data for bottom quark mass effects which we have ignored .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath34 for ech is much smaller than that found with @xmath80ps , ( @xmath105 ( thrust ) and @xmath106 ( heavy - jet mass ) ) .",
    "similarly small values are found with the dressed gluon exponentiation ( dge ) approach @xcite .",
    "a problem with the effective charge resummations is that the @xmath81 function contains a branch cut which limits how far into the 2-jet region one can go .",
    "we are limited to @xmath107 in the fits we have performed .",
    "this branch cut mirrors a corresponding branch cut in the resummed @xmath108 function .",
    "similarly as @xmath109 approaches @xmath110 the leading coefficient @xmath111 vanishes and the effective charge formalism breaks down . we need to restrict the fits to @xmath112 . from the `` rg - predictability '' arguments we might expect that these difficulties would also become apparent for a nnll @xmath80ps resummation .",
    "one will be able to check this expectation when a result for @xmath113 becomes available .     and @xmath114 .",
    "solid @xmath115 error ellipses are for ech , dashed are @xmath80ps .",
    "the arrows show the effect of varying the scale between @xmath116 . ]",
    "event shape means have also been studied in dis at hera @xcite . for such processes",
    "one has a convolution of proton pdf s and hard scattering cross - sections , @xmath117 there is no way to directly relate such quantities to effective charges . the dis cross - sections will depend on a _ factorization scale _ @xmath118 , and a renormalization scale @xmath38 at nlo . in principle",
    "one could identify unphysical scheme - dependent @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and physical uv @xmath6-logs , and then by all - orders resummation get the @xmath118 and @xmath38-dependence to `` eat itself '' .",
    "the pattern of logs is far more complicated than the geometrical progression in the effective charge case , and a corgi result for dis has not been derived so far .",
    "instead one can use the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite , and for an event shape mean @xmath121 look for a stationary saddle point in the @xmath122 plane @xcite .",
    "it turns that there are large cancellations between the nlo corrections for quark and gluon initiated subprocesses .",
    "one can distinguish between two approaches , @xmath123 where one seeks a saddle point in the @xmath122 plane for the sum of parton subprocesses , and @xmath124 where one introduces two separate scales @xmath125 and @xmath126 and finds a saddle point in @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath123 gives power corrections fits comparable to @xmath80ps with @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath124 in contrast gives substantially reduced power corrections .",
    "this is shown in figure 7 for a selection of hera event shape means .",
    "given large cancellations of nlo corrections rg - improvement should be performed _ separately _ for the @xmath129 and @xmath130-initiated subprocesses , and so @xmath124 which indeed fits the data best , is to be preferred .",
    ", and the solid line to the physical scale choice @xmath131 .",
    "the dotted line is @xmath124 and is in much better agreement with the data points .",
    "event shape means in @xmath1 annihilation are well - fitted by nlo perturbation theory in the effective charge approach , without any power corrections being required . with the usual @xmath80ps approach power corrections @xmath132",
    "are required with @xmath133 gev .",
    "similarly sized power corrections are predicted in the model of ref.@xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to modify this model so that its perturbative component matched the effective charge prediction , but this has not been done .",
    "we showed how resummation of large logarithms in the effective charge beta - function @xmath134 could be carried out for @xmath1 event shape distrtibutions .",
    "if the distributions are represented by an exponentiated effective charge then even at nlo a partial resummation of large logarithms is performed .",
    "as shown in figure 3 this results in good fits to the 1-thrust distribution , with the peak in the 2-jet region in rough agreement with the data .",
    "in contrast the @xmath80ps prediction has a badly misplaced peak in the 2-jet region , and is well below the data for the realistic value of @xmath135 mev assumed .",
    "we further showed in figure 4 that the ll ech result contains already a large part of the nll @xmath80ps result .",
    "we found unfortunately that @xmath134 contains a branch point mirroring that in the resummed @xmath77 function .",
    "this limited the fit range we could consider .",
    "we fitted for power corrections and @xmath34 to the 1-thrust distribution and heavy - jet mass distributions , finding somewhat reduced power corrections for the ech fits compared to @xmath80ps , with good stability going from nlo to ll to nll .",
    "the suggestion of the `` rg - predictability '' manifested in figure 4 would be that the nll ech result contains a large part of the nnll @xmath80ps result .",
    "this suggests that the branch point problem which limits the ability to describe the 2-jet peak , would also show up given a nnll analysis .",
    "this can be checked once the @xmath136 function becomes available .",
    "recent work on event shape means in dis was briefly mentioned and seemed to indicate that greatly reduced power corrections are found when a correctly optimised pms approach is used .",
