    "in the preceding papers ( ref . 1 and 2 , hereafter referred to as paper i and ii ) , we proposed a general variational theory for ground states of quantum many - body interacting systems .",
    "our analysis extends the well - established coupled - cluster method ( ccm ) @xcite to a variational formalism in which bra and ket states are now hermitian to one another , contrast to the traditional ccm where they are not @xcite .",
    "ever since the ccm was first proposed , attempts have been made to extend it to a standard variational formalism , for examples , in the seventies in nuclear physics @xcite and later in quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps fair to say that progress of this variational approach is slow , particularly when comparing with a plethora of applications made by the traditional ccm over the last 35 years @xcite .",
    "main difficulties in this variational approach include _ ad hoc _ approximation truncations and slow convergent numerical results . in i and ii , we provided a new systematic scheme to overcome these difficulties .",
    "in particular , we introduced two sets of important _ bare _ distribution functions and derived self - consistency equations for these functions ; calculations of physical quantities can all be done in terms of these functions . this strategy is similar to that employed by another well - established variational theory , the method of correlated basis functions ( cbf ) @xcite , where density distribution functions are key ingredients .",
    "we showed that the traditional ccm is a simple _ linear _ approximation to one set of bare distribution functions .",
    "we introduced diagrammatic techniques to calculate those distribution functions to high orders for achieving convergent results ; resummations of infinite ( reducible ) diagrams can now be done by a practical , self - consistent technique .",
    "furthermore , in our diagrammatic approach , a close relation with the cbf method was established and exploited ; a possible combination of these two methods was also proposed .",
    "we demonstrated the efficacy of our variational method by applying to quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "the ground - state properties of spin - wave theory ( swt ) @xcite was reproduced in a simple approximation .",
    "approximation beyond swt by including higher - order , infinite sets of reducible diagrams produced convergent , improved numerical results for square and cubic lattices and , interestingly , it also cures the divergence by swt in one dimensional system .    in this article",
    "we extend our variational ccm to describe excitation states .",
    "a brief report of some preliminary results has been published @xcite .",
    "we investigate two different types of excitation states using two approaches . in the first approach ,",
    "we follow the traditional ccm @xcite to investigate quasiparticle excitations , but keeping our ket and bra excited states hermitian to one another .",
    "we then investigate collective modes by adapting feynman s excitation theory of phonon - roton spectrum of helium liquid @xcite to our method . in application to antiferromagnets",
    ", we find that quasiparticle excitations correspond to anderson s spin - wave excitations which are often referred to as magnons with spin @xmath1 or @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we find collective modes in these quantum antiferromagnets as longitudinal , spin - zero magnon - density - wave excitations which have been missing in anderson s theory . in our approximation ,",
    "energy spectra of these spin - zero excitations show a large gap for a cubic lattice ( 3d ) and are gapless in a square lattice ( 2d ) .",
    "these spectra are similar to those of charge - density - wave excitations ( plasmons ) in quantum plasmas such as electron gases at low temperature @xcite .",
    "more discussion on these collective modes will be given in the final section of this article .",
    "we briefly summarize in this section our variational approach for the ground state of a many - body interacting system .",
    "details can be found in i and ii . we take a spin-@xmath3 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a bipartite lattice as our model system .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath4 where index @xmath5 runs over all lattice sites , @xmath6 runs over all @xmath7 nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "we use coester representation for both ket and bra ground - states , and write @xmath8 where model state @xmath9 is given by the classical nel state , @xmath10 and @xmath11 with nominal index @xmath12 are the so - called configurational creation and destruction operators and are given by , for the spin lattice of eq .",

    "we have used index @xmath15 exclusively for the spin - up sublattice of the nel state and index @xmath16 for the spin - down sublattice .",
    "the coefficients @xmath17 are then determined by the standard variational equations as @xmath18 the important bare distribution functions , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , can be expressed in self - consistency equations as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a function containing up to linear terms in @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) and finite order terms in @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) .",

    "i , inspired by the close relation between our approach and the cbf method , we can investigate quasiparticle - density - wave excitations by adapting feynman s excitation theory , as well as usual quasiparticle excitations by similar approach as in the traditional ccm .",

    "for the excitation operators , however , the constraints are different",

    "<S> we extend recently proposed variational coupled - cluster method to describe excitation states of quantum many - body interacting systems . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss , in general terms , both quasiparticle excitations and quasiparticle - density - wave excitations ( collective modes ) . in application to quantum antiferromagnets , we reproduce the well - known spin - wave excitations , i.e. quasiparticle magnons of spin @xmath0 . in addition , we obtain new , spin - zero magnon - density - wave excitations which has been missing in anserson s spin - wave theory . implications of these new collective modes are discussed . </S>"
