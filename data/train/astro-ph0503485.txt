    "within the last few years , new techniques and facilities have resulted in a burst of activity focused on understanding the progress of galaxy formation during the era near @xmath13 . while this epoch has been known for some time as the peak of the `` quasar era '' ( @xcite ) , until recently it has comprised part of the `` redshift desert '' about which little was known for normal galaxies .",
    "the recent exploration of galaxies in the @xmath14 era has occurred on a number of fronts : new surveys have now successfully identified samples of @xmath14 galaxies based upon their very bright far - ir and radio emission ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their signature rest - frame far ",
    "uv colors @xcite , their high luminosity in the observed @xmath15 band @xcite , red rest - frame optical colors @xcite , or some combination of the above ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results of most of these surveys suggest that it was near @xmath14 that galaxies as massive as any we see in the local universe began reaching maturity , and where a transition from rapidly star - forming to asymptotically quiescent may be occurring `` before our eyes '' for relatively massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fortuitously , galaxies in the redshift range @xmath16 are particularly well - suited to spectroscopic studies both in the observed optical @xcite and especially in the observed near - ir , where nebular lines valuable for measurement of kinematics , star - formation rates , and chemical abundances are observationally accessible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the fundamental physical measurements that can be made for high redshift galaxies , and one of the more important for placing them into the theoretical context , is the stellar mass .",
    "a number of authors in the last several years have interpreted observed - frame uv to near - ir photometry with stellar population synthesis models in order to infer the stellar mass for samples of @xmath17 galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "others have used similar methods and the technique of photometric redshifts to obtain measures of the total stellar mass as a function of redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar mass measures become increasingly uncertain as one goes to higher redshift , where ground - based observations , limited to @xmath18 @xmath8 m , probe increasingly shorter rest - frame wavelengths . at @xmath19 ,",
    "the @xmath7 band corresponds to the rest - frame optical , where current or recent star formation may dominate the observed luminosity rather than the stellar mass that has accumulated over a galaxy s lifetime .",
    "for this reason , the arrival of data from the irac instrument @xcite on board the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( hereafter _ spitzer _ ) has been widely anticipated as a means to significantly improve the measurement of stellar mass and star formation history since it is capable of obtaining very sensitive observations out to 8@xmath8 m , allowing photometric access to the rest ",
    "frame @xmath20 m light from galaxies to redshifts @xmath21 , and providing particularly sensitive observations of this region for galaxies with more modest redshifts near @xmath3 .    in this paper , we discuss the broad - band properties of a reasonably large sample of spectroscopically confirmed , uv - selected galaxies at @xmath14 in a field that was observed by the irac `` in - orbit checkout '' ( ioc ) program in the early days of _ spitzer_. the principal aim has been to explore the broad - band spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for a robustly defined sample of high redshift galaxies that naturally spans a large range in stellar mass , star - formation rate , and star - formation history .",
    "the main advantages of a uv - selected sample at @xmath14 , described in detail elsewhere @xcite are that confirming optical spectra can be easily obtained , photometric selection is highly efficient and requires using only relatively `` inexpensive '' optical ground - based photometry , and it is possible to tune color criteria to yield a roughly volume - limited sample over the desired redshift range . in this particular case ,",
    "an additional advantage was that the spectroscopic sample of galaxies already existed , as did deep photometry from observed 0.35 to 2.15 @xmath8 m and targeted near - ir spectroscopic observations .",
    "details of the near - ir photometry and spectroscopy will be presented in @xcite .",
    "the hs1700 + 6416 field is one of several we have used in a survey designed to combine observations of @xmath14 galaxies with sensitive observations of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in the same volume . in this respect ,",
    "hs1700 + 6416 ( @xmath22 ) is one of the very best - studied high redshift qsos in the entire sky , due to its unusual brightness ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it also happens to lie in the `` continuous viewing zone '' for both _",
    "spitzer _ and hst ; this fact , plus the availability of the ancillary deep ground based data , is the main reason the field was chosen for the deep ioc observations by the irac team .    in combination with the ground - based photometric and spectroscopic data , the irac observations of this field",
    "provide a means to establish the range of properties represented among galaxies selected using uv colors ; these may be useful for comparison to galaxy samples at similar redshifts but selected using other techniques .",
    "of particular interest to us is a quantitative assessment of the `` value added '' by longer wavelength photometry for assessing the galaxy properties at high redshifts as compared to what one would infer from ground - based measurements alone ( since realistically only a fraction of ground - based fields will be observed by _ spitzer _ during its lifetime ) .",
    "as it turns out , the hs1700 field is also interesting because it allows for a preliminary comparison of the dependence of @xmath14 galaxy properties on large - scale environment @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  [ sec : obs ] presents the ground - based and _ spitzer _ observations ;  [ sec : phot ] describes the photometry and the selection of the sample which is discussed in the rest of the paper ;  [ sec : mod ] describes the use of stellar population synthesis models to infer physical properties of the galaxies from their broad - band spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ;  [ sec : results ] summarizes the results of the modeling focusing on the galaxy stellar masses and mass - to - light ratios @xmath24 ;  [ sec : discussion ] discusses the results and their general implications ;  [ sec : summary ] summarizes the main results .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 throughout .",
    "images of the hs1700@xmath2864 field were obtained in 2001 may using the william herschel 4.2 m telescope on la palma and the prime focus imager .",
    "the wht system uses a 2-chip mosaic of marconi 2k x 4k ccds with especially good uv quantum efficiency , and provides a field of view of 16  by 16  sampled at 0236 per pixel .",
    "the conditions during the observing run were excellent , with sub - arcsecond seeing in all bands .",
    "the field was roughly centered on the position of the qso , and 15 arcsecond dithers were executed between subsequent exposures in order to allow for fringe removal in the @xmath29 band and the creation of dark sky superflats ( particularly necessary in the @xmath30 band ) .",
    "the data were reduced using procedures described in detail by @xcite .",
    "additional images in the @xmath30 band covering the central 5  by 7  region of the wht field were obtained in 2001 may using the blue side of the low resolution imaging spectrometer on the keck i 10 m telescope @xcite .",
    "these were scaled , variance weighted and combined with the wht data to form the final @xmath30 image .",
    "properties of the reduced and stacked images are summarized in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we observed the hs1700@xmath2864 field during two observing runs , 2003 may and 2003 october , using the palomar 5.1 m hale telescope and the wide field infrared camera ( wirc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the images were taken in the k - short ( @xmath7 ) filter , obtained in a sequence of 30-second integrations , moving the telescope in a prescribed dither pattern after each sequence of 4 exposures .",
    "the conditions during both observing runs were generally good , with seeing ranging between 055 and 099 , but the ambient temperature was warm resulting in relatively high @xmath7 band sky backgrounds ( @xmath31 mag arcsec@xmath32 ) .",
    "the wirc camera employs a rockwell hgcdte `` hawaii-2 '' 2k x 2k array , providing a field of view of 85 x 85 with a spatial sampling of 0.249 arcsec per pixel .",
    "the wirc data from each ( typically 54 minute ) dither sequence were reduced , registered , and stacked using a set of idl scripts written by k. bundy ( private communication ) .",
    "the resulting images were then registered and combined using iraf tasks .",
    "the final @xmath7 image represents a total of 11.03 hours of integration in the parts of the image that received the full integration time .",
    "the final mosaic was trimmed to include only the parts of the image receiving 50% or more of the total integration time ( @xmath33 of the trimmed image received the full exposure time ) .",
    "the image was calibrated with reference to the near - ir standards of @xcite .",
    "observations with the infrared array camera ( irac ) were obtained in 2003 october during the `` in - orbit checkout '' ( ioc ) of _ spitzer_. the observing strategy and data reductions are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the irac observations were designed to overlap as much as possible with the ground - based @xmath7 and optical images , but some compromises were adopted to avoid known foreground galaxy clusters in the field , so that the irac pointings were biased toward the sw relative to the ground - based data , which are centered on the bright qso . as detailed below , the irac images in the 4 irac bands ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) completely overlap over only a relatively small fraction of the field observed in the @xmath7 band described above , with the smallest overlap in the irac channel 1 ( 3.6@xmath8 m ) and channel 3 ( 5.8 @xmath8 m ) images , but much larger overlap in channels 2 ( 4.5@xmath8 m ) and 4 ( 8.0@xmath8 m ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : map ] illustrates the regions covered in the irac images compared to those covered in the palomar @xmath7 image .",
    "the photometric calibrations for the irac images were as determined by the irac team @xcite ; however , we used a significantly different method for performing the photometry and estimating the photometric uncertainty ( see  [ sec : photirac ] ) , resulting in significantly more conservative ( i.e. larger ) estimated errors at a given flux density .",
    "the observables from our ground - based images are @xmath34 magnitudes and isophotal @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 colors , with isophotes defined in the @xmath34 detection catalog . in order to mimic the actual observing process , we therefore estimated uncertainties in isophotal color rather than magnitude for all optical / ir bands except @xmath29 .",
    "the uncertainties were estimated separately for the optical and ir photometry , by adding large numbers of simulated galaxies of known magnitudes to the images and comparing their recovered photometry with their input parameters .",
    "the simulated galaxies were drawn from templates of exponential disks with scale lengths ranging from 005 to 04 , smoothed to match the seeing of the individual images . for the @xmath35 uncertainties , we selected galaxies at random within the range @xmath38 and @xmath39 and placed them at random positions on the @xmath34 and @xmath7 images , 200 at a time ( to avoid overcrowding ) for a total of 250,000 fake galaxies .",
    "we then performed photometry as usual on the images , and compared the catalog of detections with the input list of simulated galaxies .",
    "we considered the quantity @xmath40= ( { \\cal r}-k_s)_{meas}-({\\cal r}-k_s)_{true}$ ] , and binned in steps of 0.5 mag in @xmath41 and 0.2 mag in @xmath42 . the mean value of @xmath43 $ ] is an estimate of the bias in the photometry ; for typical objects , @xmath44 < 0.05 $ ] mag .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath45)$ ] provides an estimate of the @xmath35 uncertainty for objects that fall in each bin ; this was typically @xmath46 ) \\sim 0.25 $ ] mag .",
    "@xmath35 uncertainties for each object are given in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath29 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 were determined in a similar fashion , by adding large numbers of fake galaxies to the @xmath30 , @xmath47 and @xmath29 images and comparing their recovered and input properties , with the additional restriction that only those objects whose recovered photometry met our selection criteria were considered .",
    "we binned in @xmath29 and @xmath36 to determine the @xmath29 and @xmath36 uncertainties , which were typically @xmath48 mag and @xmath49 ) \\sim 0.07 $ ] mag , and in @xmath47 and @xmath37 to determine @xmath37 uncertainties , typically @xmath50 ) \\sim 0.13 $ ] mag .",
    "again uncertainties for each object are given in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "similar techniques for estimating photometric uncertainties have been used in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we measured irac fluxes by first computing an empirical point spread function ( psf ) for each channel by median averaging the signal from several isolated point sources located throughout the mosaiced irac data in the hs1700 field and normalizing the resulting psf to have unit flux .",
    "we obtained accurate object positions ( @xmath51  rms uncertainty ) for @xmath5295% of irac sources in the field from their @xmath7-band counterparts in the wirc imaging of this field , or from their @xmath29-band counterparts for the small fraction of objects detected in @xmath29 but not in @xmath7 .",
    "we then used the empirically - determined irac psf to simultaneously model the emission of all objects within a sub - image of size 24  surrounding each object of interest , similar to methods generally used for photometry of stellar objects in crowded fields .",
    "this procedure to some extent mitigates the effects of confusion noise , since the object positions are known _ a priori _ from the much higher spatial resolution @xmath7 band image , and allows for some de - blending of objects that are only partially resolved in the irac images .",
    "the method is also similar to that employed by @xcite and @xcite for comparing ground - based near - ir and hst / wfpc-2 photometry .",
    "photometric errors were computed by adding in quadrature the error in the source flux ( poisson noise ) and the dispersion in measured flux values found by fitting psfs to 100 random positions containing no obvious sources near the object of interest .",
    "this latter estimate should account to a large extent for noise due to source confusion , which is particularly relevant in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath8 m bands .",
    "except in cases of very bright sources , the background dispersion dominates the errors .",
    "the psf full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and approximate 5@xmath53 sensitivity limits for each channel are presented in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "we omitted any measured fluxes with uncertainties larger than 0.5 magnitudes from consideration in fitting the seds as described in ",
    "[ sec : modsamp ] .",
    "in addition , we set the errors to 0.10 magnitudes for measurements whose formal uncertainties calculated using the above prescription were @xmath54 magnitudes , in order to account for systematic uncertainties in the photometry that are not otherwise accounted for ( e.g. , source confusion on scales smaller than the psf , estimation of local background , etc . ) .      because the redshift of hs1700 + 643 is @xmath55 and we were interested in the properties of the galaxies in the `` foreground , '' the spectroscopic observations targeted photometrically selected galaxies that would neatly cover the redshift range @xmath56 . to accomplish this we selected a combination of objects satisfying either the `` bx '' photometric criteria of @xcite ( @xmath57 ) or the `` md '' photometric criteria of @xcite ( @xmath58 . a total of 100 objects ( 81 `` bx '' and 19 `` md '' ) has measured spectroscopic redshifts @xmath59 from observations with the low resolution imaging spectrometer , described in detail in @xcite . because the surface density of bx candidates is @xmath60 times higher than that of md candidates to the same @xmath61 apparent magnitude limit",
    ", the expected redshift distribution for a bx / md photometric sample , based on the total of 1133 spectroscopic redshifts for bx / md candidates in all survey fields , is @xmath62 .",
    "the sample of galaxies discussed in the rest of the paper is culled from the region of overlap between the ground - based @xmath63 images , the ground - based @xmath7 image , the 4 irac bands ( see figure  [ fig : map ] ) and the spectroscopic observations of uv - selected galaxies . within the 83 by 78 region covered by the palomar @xmath7 image",
    ", there is a total of 508 bx and md - type galaxy candidates identified from the optical photometry using the selection criteria defined by @xcite and @xcite , respectively ; of those , 389 ( 77% ) of the objects are significantly detected in the @xmath7-band image . within the 64.7 square arcmin region covered by the @xmath7 image , we obtained spectra for 162 of the 508 photometric candidates and spectroscopically identified 98 objects .",
    "the identified fraction represents a 60.5% spectroscopic success rate , similar to that of our @xmath3 survey overall @xcite . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", we expect the unidentifed objects have the same redshift distribution as the spectroscopic successes .",
    "of the 98 objects with spectroscopic identifications , 92 are detected in the @xmath7 image to @xmath64 ; of the 92 objects with spectroscopic ids and @xmath7 detections , 79 ( 86% ) are at @xmath59 and have a mean redshift and dispersion of @xmath65 , entirely consistent with the expected redshift distribution for all bx / md candidates as discussed above .",
    "of the 79 spectroscopically identified @xmath14 galaxies , 72 are detected in one or more of the irac passbands and included in the stellar population analysis .",
    "invariably , objects detected significantly at 2.15 @xmath8 m are also detected in the irac 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath8 m bands ; the 7 galaxies detected at 2.15@xmath8 m but not with irac simply fall outside of the well - exposed regions of the irac pointings .    in summary ,",
    "the 72 @xmath14 galaxies discussed in this paper are representative of a uv - selected sample to @xmath61 , but are objects which are also detected in both the near and mid - ir .",
    "the only possible bias of this sample relative to any sample selected using the same uv criteria is that it excludes the @xmath66% of bx / md candidates in the field that are not detected to @xmath67 .",
    "the redshift distribution for this spectroscopic sample with near and mid - ir detections is shown in figure  [ fig : zhist ] .",
    "very strikingly , there is a significant galaxy overdensity in this distribution at @xmath68 , which allows for an examination of galaxy properties as a function of large - scale environment @xcite .",
    "it is of interest , for some purposes , to ask what fraction of a mid - ir selected galaxy sample at the same redshift is represented by objects selected using the uv color criteria .",
    "this is a difficult question to answer , as there is as yet no large spectroscopic sample of mid - ir selected high redshift galaxies ( and , as we argue below , photometric redshifts may be an inadequate approach to the problem ) .",
    "however , we can make a rough estimate as follows .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested a region in irac 3.6/4.5/5.8 @xmath8 m color space that may make it possible to select high redshift galaxies from irac colors alone , based on models and the observed locations of @xmath69 uv - selected galaxies in irac color space . in figure",

    "443 are included in the optical photometric catalog to @xmath61 , 99 of which satisfy the criteria proposed by  @xcite in the 3.6 - 5.8@xmath8 m color space .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : iracugr ] , 46 of the 99 sources satsifying the @xcite color criteria do indeed lie in the regions of @xmath63 color space from which @xmath14 bm ( @xmath72 ) , bx ( @xmath57 ) , md ( @xmath73 ) and c / d / m ( @xmath74 ) @xcite galaxies are drawn .",
    "however , there is a significant number of galaxies ( @xmath75 ) which satisfy the barmby et al .",

    "of the 175 galaxies that are well detected in the @xmath7 , 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8 @xmath8 m bands but absent from the optical catalog , 81 satisfy the @xcite color criteria . assuming that the same percentage ( @xmath75% ) of these are likely to be in the foreground as for the optically detected galaxies , @xmath79 galaxies to @xmath80 are plausibly at @xmath81 band to @xmath82 but are not included in figure  [ fig : iracugr ] because the colors are not reliably measured . ] .",
    "most of the galaxies in this red sample are relatively faint in the @xmath7 band , with only 12 of 81 having @xmath83 , of which perhaps 6 - 8 are high redshift objects .    in summary , of the 180 galaxies well detected in the in the @xmath7 , 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8 @xmath8 m bands that also satisfy the @xcite criteria , 46 would be selected based on @xmath63 colors to be at @xmath81 , @xmath84 ( @xmath75% )",

    "thus , we conclude that @xmath79% of galaxies at @xmath88 to an apparent magnitude limit of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 on the ab system ) would be selected using the rest - uv color criteria to @xmath61 .",
    "this statistic is broadly consistent with the results of the fires survey @xcite which targeted galaxies with colors @xmath91 , most of which are similarly optically faint , as well as with the `` irac eros '' discussed by @xcite .",

    "the fitted parameters included : dust extinction ( parameterized by @xmath112 ) , age ( @xmath113 ) , star - formation rate ( sfr ) , stellar mass ( @xmath114 ) , and star - formation history ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "for each @xmath115 , we used a grid of @xcite models with ages ranging between 1 myr and the age of the universe at the redshift of the galaxy being modeled and extinctions ranging between @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( though none of the galaxies has a best - fit @xmath118 ) . for each combination of @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath115",
    ", we computed the full @xmath99 plus irac @xmath119 m sed of the model placed at the redshift of the observed galaxy . in computing this sed , we reddened the intrinsic model galaxy spectrum by dust , and further attenuated it in a manner simulating absorption by the intergalactic medium of neutral hydrogen @xcite , which affects the predicted @xmath30 and @xmath47 magnitudes .",
    "@xcite csf models are by default normalized to have star - formation rates of @xmath120 , while declining models are normalized to have a total mass of @xmath121 at @xmath122 .",
    "we searched for the model normalization that minimized the value of @xmath123 with respect to the measured sed , which yielded an estimate of the star - formation rate and stellar mass .",
    "the combination of @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath115 and normalization yielding the lowest @xmath123 was called the overall `` best - fit '' .",
    "figure  [ fig : seds1 ] shows the overall best - fit model together with the observed data points for each of the 72 galaxies in the sample . in most cases",
    "the `` best - fit '' @xmath115 model is not significantly better than that of the best - fitting model for every other value of @xmath115 considered , as discussed below .",
    "even neglecting the effects of photometric uncertainties , parameters derived from sed fitting are subject to significant degeneracies and systematics , primarily because of the inability to constrain the star - formation history @xcite .",
    "these uncertainties apply even using the simplest single - component models , as we do here , since the best - fit age , extinction , and star - formation rate all depend systematically on the @xmath115 used to describe the star - formation history .",
    "stellar mass estimates are more robust in the face of uncertainties in the star - formation history . here",
    "we review the systematic uncertainties in age , extinction , star - formation rate , and stellar mass that result from population synthesis modeling of galaxy seds at high redshift .",
    "the inferred age , @xmath113 , for a given value of @xmath115 is constrained mainly by the magnitude of the age - sensitive balmer break .",
    "a given balmer break strength indicates the relative number of a and o stars and corresponds to older ages when larger values are assumed for @xmath115 ( i.e. a given relative number of a / o stars is reached at later times for more gradually declining star - formation histories ) .",
    "the inferred extinction , @xmath112 , also depends systematically on the star - formation history : declining star - formation histories with @xmath124 with less dust extinction can produce similar @xmath125 and @xmath35 colors to those of a model with a larger @xmath115 , smaller @xmath126 and more dust extinction . in this case , the reddening of the rest - frame uv slope is caused by a mixture of stars with later spectral types on average for models with smaller @xmath115 , whereas dust extinction accounts for the uv reddening in continuous star - formation models or those with larger values of @xmath115 .",
    "the systematic dependence of the inferred sfr on the value of @xmath115 that parameterizes the star - formation history stems from two effects .",
    "first , the star - formation rate is derived from the extinction - corrected uv - luminosity .",
    "it therefore depends on the best - fit value of @xmath112 , which as we discussed above , depends on the star - formation history used to model the observed sed .",
    "second , a conversion from extinction - corrected uv - luminosity to sfr is required .",
    "this conversion depends on both @xmath113 and @xmath115 , and for a given galaxy , is generally an increasing function of @xmath115 . the conversion from uv - luminosity to sfr equilibrates after about 100  myr for models with @xmath127  gyr @xcite . however , the ratio of sfr to uv luminosity declines as a function of time for models with smaller @xmath115 . in the range of parameter space spanned by the galaxies in our sample , @xmath128  myr models typically have uv - to - sfr conversions @xmath129 times lower than continuous sfr models that fit the same colors .",
    "while not likely , based on external ( spectroscopic ) information , models with @xmath130  myr have much more extreme conversions from uv - luminosity to sfr , as much as @xmath131 times lower than the limit approached by the models with large @xmath115 .",
    "this is easily understood since the largest @xmath130  myr age that can reasonably fit the observed colors of the galaxies in our sample is roughly @xmath132  myr . at this point ,",
    "the star - formation rate is roughly 20000 times lower than at @xmath133 .",
    "however , the uv - luminosity has only declined by a factor of @xmath134 , because while there are no o - stars left , the lifetime of late b - stars is roughly @xmath135  myr , so they have not yet disappeared .",
    "our single - component - model estimates of stellar masses are not plagued by the same amount of systematic uncertainty , especially when considering more realistic exponential timescales , @xmath136  myr .",
    "there has been much discussion in the literature about the value of rest - frame near - ir photometry in measuring stellar masses @xcite .",
    "in fact , as shown by the model fits to bx490 and bx505 , which have very similar rest - frame near - ir magnitudes , rest - frame near - ir photometry alone is insufficient to constrain the stellar mass - to - light ratio of star - forming galaxies to better than a factor of 10 ( see also  [ sec : resultsmcorr ] ) .",
    "however , with rest - frame uv , optical , and near - ir photometry , the near - ir @xmath10 ratio ( and therefore the stellar mass ) is reasonably well - determined , almost independent of the value of @xmath115 used to fit the sed . with measurements of the rest - frame uv slope ( observed @xmath36 color at high redshift ) , the rest - frame uv / optical color ( observed @xmath35 ) , and",
    "rest - frame uv / near - ir color ( observed @xmath137 ) , the variance in inferred near - ir @xmath10 ratio due to uncertainties in the form of the star - formation history ( for @xmath138  myr ) is typically 10% .",
    "the relationship between ( @xmath36 , @xmath139 , @xmath137 ) and @xmath10 ratio starts to break down for star - formation histories with @xmath140  myr . the systematic uncertainty in the @xmath10 ratio therefore increases , except in the cases where @xmath141  myr ( and @xmath142 for all star - formation histories under consideration ) , when all star - formation histories yield the same best - fit stellar population parameters .",
    "however , for most galaxies in the sample , there is no indication that models with @xmath143  myr with @xmath124 are preferred , and in some cases such star - formation histories are actually ruled out ( see discussion in section  [ sec : discussmassive ] ) .",
    "external constraints can be used to evaluate the likelihood that these extreme `` decaying burst '' star - formation histories are realistic .",
    "for example , @xcite have shown that the mean extinction - corrected star - formation rate for @xmath144 galaxies in the chandra deep field north , inferred from rest - frame uv luminosities and colors , assuming @xmath145  myr of continuous star formation and the calzetti extinction law , agrees very well with the average star - formation rate derived from stacked x - ray and radio images of the same galaxies .",
    "if @xmath146 had been assumed , the average uv - derived star - formation rate would have been several times smaller , and no longer in agreement with the star - formation rate inferred from the average x - ray or radio continuum flux . in principle , the degeneracies that affect primarily the interpretation of the uv continuum slope can be removed if there is external information on the number of massive stars still present in the galaxies .",
    "for example , using observed h@xmath93 fluxes and/or high quality far - uv spectra , it is relatively easy to establish whether o stars are still present in the galaxy spectra . in general , the high success rate in detecting h@xmath93 emission from uv - selected galaxies , and in particular the fact that the star - formation rate inferred from h@xmath93 fluxes is never smaller than that inferred from the uv continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , suggests that it must be quite rare to catch a starburst with @xmath147 and @xmath148  myr .",
    "additionally , in the individual lris rest - frame uv spectra with sufficient s / n , one sees evidence for the existence of massive stars from the presence of c  iv and si  iv p - cygni stellar wind features , and , in some cases ly@xmath93 emission .",
    "if @xmath140  myr and @xmath126 were much greater than 1 in most cases , we would not expect to find such strong evidence for massive o stars in the rest - frame uv spectra of these objects .",
    "the systematic effects discussed above do not include the uncertainties that result from including models with underlying short bursts of different strengths occurring at random times in the past @xcite .",
    "we did not add that layer of complexity to our modeling procedure , given the difficulty we found in distinguishing among even simple exponentially declining and continuous star - formation histories .",
    "however , as @xcite demonstrated , underlying maximally old bursts with @xmath149 can increase the @xmath10 by a factor of a several without having an appreciable effect on the rest - frame uv - to - optical colors .",
    "@xcite find that including random bursts into the range of star - formation histories used to fit the @xmath150 colors of @xmath151 galaxies causes the derived masses to increase by less than a factor of two , although the amount by which one might be underestimating the true stellar mass will depend on the observed galaxy colors .",
    "we return to this question in section  [ sec : resultsmcorr ] .",
    "[ fig : seds1 ]    [ fig : seds2 ]    [ fig : seds3 ]    [ fig : seds4 ]      in addition to the best - fit stellar population parameters for each galaxy , we also found the parameter confidence intervals allowed by the photometric uncertainties .",
    "a large set ( @xmath152 ) of fake seds was generated for each galaxy , by perturbing the observed sed in a manner consistent with the estimated photometric error bars ( sections  [ sec : photoptir ] and [ sec : photirac ] ) .",
    "each perturbed sed was fit in exactly the same manner as the observed sed , and a set of best - fit stellar population parameters was chosen to minimize @xmath123 with respect to the perturbed sed .",
    "we determined the confidence intervals over @xmath112 , @xmath113 , sfr , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , such that 68.3% and 95.4% confidence intervals contain the corresponding fractions of the monte carlo realizations .",
    "more than half of the galaxies in our sample have 95.4% confidence intervals that span all @xmath115 values , indicating the difficulty of distinguishing among the different star - formation histories with broad - band photometry alone . in practice ,",
    "the most useful number we derive from the monte carlo confidence intervals for each galaxy is the uncertainty on the stellar mass . for this quantity , it is important to know not only the random effects of photometric errors , but also the systematic effect of allowing @xmath115 to vary .",
    "the @xmath153 monte carlo stellar mass uncertainties in column 7 of table 3 , derived from simulations in which @xmath115 was allowed to vary , reflect the uncertainty in @xmath115 .",
    "we also list the monte carlo stellar mass uncertainties for csf star - formation histories in table 3 .    to demonstrate the covariance of different parameters , and at least some of the range of stellar populations present in our sample , we show in figure  [ fig : mcplots ] the @xmath113 vs. @xmath112 and @xmath114 vs. @xmath113 confidence intervals derived from monte carlo simulations .",
    "these confidence intervals do not assume a fixed value for @xmath115 , but are the results of simulations in which @xmath115 was allowed to vary .",
    "the confidence intervals displayed include those of bx879 ( @xmath154 ) , which appears to be a very young ( @xmath155  myr ) , dusty stellar population with high instantaneous star - formation rate and low stellar mass , all of which parameters are independent of @xmath115 because of the extremely young age ; bx691 ( @xmath156 ) , an evolved stellar population with @xmath124 , @xmath115 constrained to be between @xmath157 and @xmath158  gyr , moderate current star - formation rate and large stellar mass ; and bx563 ( @xmath159 ) , for which there are no constraints on the star - formation history , but the stellar mass of which is close to the sample median .",
    "the large extent of the bx563 confidence interval in @xmath113 vs. @xmath112 space demonstrates some of the fundamental limitations of population synthesis modeling .",
    "the goal of population synthesis modeling is to infer physical quantities from observed galaxy magnitudes and colors , in particular the stellar mass . in the best - case scenario",
    "we would also like to place constraints on the timescale of the current star - formation episode , and therefore the level of dust extinction and the dust - corrected star - formation rate .",
    "there are certain limitations of the modeling procedure , however , that are worth pointing out , in addition to the systematic uncertainties discussed in section  [ sec : modsysunc ] .",
    "first , it is not always possible to find a statistically acceptable fit to the observed galaxy colors , especially using relatively simple models .",
    "seven galaxies in the sample have best - fit models with significantly higher @xmath123 values than those of the rest of the sample .",
    "two of these galaxies ( bx490 ( @xmath160 ) and bx794 ( @xmath161 ) ) have large @xmath139 residuals that are likely to be explained in terms of contamination from @xmath96 emission in the @xmath7 band .",
    "another galaxy , bx561 ( @xmath162 ) , has a good fit except for the irac @xmath163  @xmath8 m point , which yields a significant positive residual , possibly due to the presence of an obscured agn ( see  [ sec : resultsagn ] ) .",
    "md157 shows rest - frame uv spectroscopic evidence for hosting a broad - line agn , which probably contaminates the @xmath7 flux ( strong @xmath96 ) and irac @xmath163  @xmath8 m band .",
    "the seds of the remaining three galaxies ( bx581 ( @xmath164 ) , bx756 ( @xmath165 ) , and bx681 ( @xmath166 ) ) are very difficult to understand , with both large @xmath7 and irac residuals that are both positive and negative , and do nt stem from obvious irregularities in any of the imaging data .",
    "a second issue is the apparent discrepancy between model parameters based on the best fit to broad - band photometry and those inferred from rest - frame uv spectra , which applies for a small number of galaxies in the sample : bx1032 ( @xmath167 ) , bx1087 @xmath168 , and bx536 ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "not only did we obtain statistically acceptable fits to the observed photometry of these galaxies , but also the results of the monte carlo simulations appear to rule out star - formation histories with @xmath170  myr , and to favor best - fit @xmath126 significantly greater than unity , with quite modest star - formation rates of a few @xmath171 .",
    "the broad - band photometry of these galaxies implies star - formation histories in which the bulk of stellar mass formed in the past , and the current star - formation rate is much lower than the past average .",
    "we also have rest - frame uv keck  i / lris spectra for these galaxies , which can be used as a consistency check on the stellar population parameters derived from the sed - fitting procedure .",
    "the spectra of bx1032 and bx1087 both show prominent c  iv p - cygni features , which are produced in the winds of massive stars , associated with active ongoing star formation .",
    "the rest - frame uv spectra of bx1087 and bx536 both contain broad he  ii emission , which is produced by wolf - rayet stars , another indication of a young stellar population .",
    "finally , the spectrum of bx1032 exhibits nebular emission lines such as ciii ] and he  ii , further indications of active current star formation . in short , the rest - frame uv spectra of these @xmath172 galaxies contain features that are not consistent with the best - fit models used to describe the rest - frame uv to near - ir sed , which is all the more striking since the models appear fairly well - constrained .",
    "clearly , there are cases in which the simple , single - component sed - fitting procedure fails to capture the true nature of the galaxy stellar population .",
    "rest - frame uv and optical spectra , and x - ray , submillimeter , and radio fluxes , provide valuable complementary information that must be included to better - constrain all of the stellar population parameters .",
    "the limitations inherent in sed fitting , without external constraints ( and especially without spectroscopic identifications ) , should be borne in mind when considering the resulting stellar population parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the stellar masses inferred for these three galaxies are largely independent of the star - formation history assumed , and therefore we include them in all further discussion of stellar masses .",
    "in figure  [ fig : seds1 ] , we show the observed optical , near - ir , and _ spitzer _",
    "photometry and best - fit models for the entire sample of uv - selected @xmath3 galaxies in the hs1700 field with spectroscopic redshifts , @xmath7 , and _",
    "spitzer_/irac photometry .",
    "the solid lines indicate best - fit exponential @xcite models including the irac measurements , whereas the dotted lines indicate fits to only @xmath173 photometry . the stellar mass inferred from the best - fit to the entire sed ( including irac photometry )",

    "[ tab : mod ] , we list the best - fit stellar population parameters for each object , including the entire optical through irac sed .",
    "parameters are listed for the best - fit model assuming @xmath174 ( csf ) , and also for the exponentially declining model that formally yielded the lowest value of @xmath123 when @xmath115 was allowed to vary as a free parameter .",
    "there is a subset of galaxies with extremely young best - fit ages ( @xmath155  myr ) , for which all values of @xmath115 yield nearly identical stellar population parameters .",
    "these galaxies include : bx928 , bx1075 , bx794 , md128 , bx879 , bx490 , md155 , md152 , bx588 , and md126 . in such cases where @xmath113 is smaller than any of the @xmath115 values considered ,",
    "the star - formation history ( as parameterized by @xmath115 ) becomes irrelevant .    from both figure  [ fig : seds1 ] and table  [ tab : mod ] , it is clear that a large range of rest - frame uv to rest - frame near - ir seds is included in our sample .",
    "in particular , we highlight the variety of rest - frame uv / near - ir colors , which translates directly into a large range of inferred near - ir mass - to - light ratios .",

    "figure  [ fig : mcsfmtau ] compares the stellar mass obtained assuming the best - fit @xmath115 model to the stellar mass implied by the best - fit csf models .",
    "the agreement , both in terms of the mass distribution and the masses of individual objects , is excellent , with no obvious systematic trend or offset .    for some purposes , it is of interest to break down the inferred stellar mass distribution as a function of observed @xmath7-band magnitude , since a number of other surveys of galaxies at similar redshifts are selected in that band .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : mvsk ] , where the @xmath7 limits are chosen to correspond to the limits imposed by some of these other surveys . as expected",
    ", there is a clear trend of increasing inferred stellar mass with increasing rest - frame optical luminosity , although , as discussed below , there is significant scatter in rest - optical @xmath10 at a fixed mass or luminosity .",
    "the typical ( median ) monte carlo uncertainties in individual stellar mass estimates are @xmath178% , derived from simulations in which @xmath115 was allowed to vary as a free parameter . if we model all galaxies in the sample with csf star - formation histories , we find that the median monte carlo stellar mass uncertainty is @xmath179% .",
    "these values indicate that , for the same photometry and uncertainties , csf models actually yield stellar mass uncertainties at least as large as the ones derived when @xmath115 is allowed to vary as a free parameter .",
    "one of the fundamental limitations of the analysis in @xcite and @xcite was the the inability to discriminate among different star - formation histories with only rest - frame uv and optical photometry .",
    "we have shown that , even with the addition of _",
    "spitzer_/irac photometry , this inability to constrain star - formation histories persists for most galaxies in our @xmath3 sample .",
    "the broad - band seds are particularly degenerate with respect to age , dust content , and star - formation rates , while the inferred stellar mass suffers from much less systematic uncertainty .",
    "another question raised in the pre-_spitzer _ era was whether or not rest - frame near - ir photometry of @xmath180 galaxies would uncover considerably more stellar mass from old bursts than had been inferred from seds whose longest wavelength measurement was the ground - based @xmath7 band , corresponding to the rest - frame optical at the redshifts of interest here .",
    "such stellar composite populations might have been revealed through irac fluxes in excess of the rest - frame near - ir extension of model fits to the rest - frame uv through optical seds .",
    "figure  [ fig : iracvnoirac ] shows the relationship between @xmath181 , the stellar mass inferred when the irac photometry is excluded from the fit , and @xmath182 , the stellar mass derived using irac photometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : mhist ] displays this relationship in one dimension , with the distribution of @xmath181 indicated as an unshaded histogram in front of the shaded histogram of @xmath182 .",
    "what both figures demonstrate is that , on average , the stellar mass inferred with and without irac data agree without a large systematic offset , though the scatter in this relationship is significant and larger than the typical ( formal ) uncertainties in the individual stellar mass estimates using the full sed .",
    "table [ tab : mvsk ] compares these inferred stellar mass distributions as a function of limiting observed @xmath7 flux .",
    "the average of log @xmath181 - log @xmath182 = 0.06 , with a standard deviation of 0.35 dex ; the median difference is only 0.01 dex .",
    "we find only five galaxies whose optical  irac seds imply stellar masses more than a factor of two larger than that inferred from the optical@xmath7 seds .",
    "the most dramatic such example is bx898 , whose observed @xmath183 m flux is @xmath184 times larger than that predicted by the fit to the optical@xmath7 sed alone .",
    "the inferred stellar mass is @xmath185 times larger if the irac @xmath183 m point is included in the sed fit .",
    "unfortunately , bx898 has a significant irac measurement only at @xmath183 m , and contamination of this measurement ( or , a statistical outlier in the observed @xmath7 measurement ) can not be ruled out .    it is more common for the fit to the optical@xmath7 sed to _ overpredict _ the stellar mass relative to that inferred from the optical  irac sed .",
    "we believe that this discrepancy arises in most cases because of the contamination of the @xmath7 continuum flux by @xmath186}$ ] line emission at @xmath187 .",
    "the addition of the irac photometry to the seds of galaxies with strong @xmath96 emission sometimes reveals the @xmath7 data point as a positive outlier relative to the overall sed fit ( e.g. bx794 and bx490 ) , and the best - fit balmer break is smaller than the observed @xmath188 color alone would imply . in the absence of irac photometry",
    ", the @xmath7 measurement strongly influences the inferred stellar mass because it is the only proxy for the strength of the balmer break , resulting in a bias toward somewhat higher values . in support of this interpretation , for the four galaxies in the hs1700 @xmath7/irac pointings with published @xmath96 measurements",
    ", we find an average ratio of 1.55 between @xmath181 and @xmath182 when no correction for @xmath96 emission is applied .",
    "when @xmath96 emission is corrected for , we find an average @xmath189 of 1.11 , i.e. closer to unity .",
    "more complete @xmath96 surveys are necessary to remove the @xmath7 emission line bias , especially in order to model objects for which @xmath7 is the reddest available band @xcite .    without irac photometry ,",
    "we find typical monte carlo stellar mass uncertainties of @xmath190% for csf models , which is @xmath191 times larger than the typical stellar mass uncertainties estimated when including the irac photometry .",
    "when @xmath115 is allowed to vary , the typical stellar mass uncertainty is @xmath192% , @xmath193 times larger than the typical uncertainty inferred with irac photometry .",
    "thus , while the lack of irac photometry does not appear to cause a large bias in the stellar mass estimates , the inclusion of irac photometry significantly reduces the formal uncertainties .    while we have noted the possibility of h@xmath93 contamination of the @xmath7-band measurements for the @xmath19460% of the current sample having redshifts where this is a potential problem , the _ total _ inferred stellar mass for the full sample of 72 galaxies differs by only @xmath195% when irac measurements are included or excluded ( in the sense that the inferred total mass is higher without the irac data included )",
    "thus , while the addition of longer - wavelength data leads to significantly smaller uncertainties in the estimates of the stellar masses of individual galaxies , the irac data do not appear to be essential for obtaining reasonable stellar mass estimates for galaxies at @xmath14 , particularly when statistics of large samples are most relevant .",
    "it is often asserted that estimates of stellar mass from photometric measurements become increasingly reliable as one obtains longer wavelength data .",
    "we have certainly found this to be the case , as discussed above ; however , it is not true that long - wavelength observations can be used to measure stellar masses without understanding the recent star - formation history of the galaxy , even when observations extend into the rest - frame near - ir as for the irac observations of @xmath14 galaxies .",
    "this point is illustrated in figures  [ fig : kvm ] and [ fig : ch2vm ] ; we have chosen the observed @xmath7 band and the observed irac channel 2 ( 4.5@xmath8 m ) band since the former is the longest wavelength measurement possible from the ground , and the latter lies close to @xmath196 m in the rest frame at the mean redshift of the current sample ( 68/72 of the galaxies in the sample have been measured in irac channel 2 ) , where the peak in the sed produced by older stellar populations is expected .",
    "figure [ fig : kvm ] shows the absolute magnitude of the galaxies based on their observed @xmath7-band magnitudes , which at the median redshift of @xmath197 corresponds to rest - frame 0.65@xmath8 m ( i.e. , r band ) .",
    "note that while there is clearly a correlation between absolute r - band magnitude and stellar mass , there is a large enough range in star - formation history among the sample that a measurement of a particular rest - frame luminosity would map quite poorly onto stellar mass .",
    "the dotted and dashed curves show that there is a range in inferred @xmath10 of a factor of @xmath84 among the sample .",
    "this large factor applies even for objects that are bright in the @xmath7 band ( @xmath198 ) , indicated with open circles .",
    "the very largest stellar @xmath10 values approach that of present - day galaxies @xcite , but the average value is @xmath199 times smaller , @xmath200 ( where both @xmath201 and @xmath202 are in solar units , and @xmath202 is evaluated in the rest - frame @xmath203 band ) .",
    "the situation is improved at @xmath204 m ( @xmath194 rest - frame 1.4@xmath8 m ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : ch2vm ] ; the scatter in the stellar @xmath10 is a factor of @xmath195 , with indications that the scatter decreases for the most luminous galaxies in the rest - frame near - ir , which tend to have @xmath10 very close to that of present - day galaxies .",
    "the scatter in @xmath10 is also greatly reduced when the sample is limited to objects with @xmath205 ( the reddest quartile ) , indicated with open squares . still , among the total sample studied here , the average value is @xmath206 , roughly 2.5 times smaller than typical in the local universe at the same rest wavelengths .",
    "the local @xmath10 ratios were derived with an imf containing fewer low - mass stars than are found in the standard @xmath207 salpeter imf , used for the current work .",
    "adopting the `` diet '' salpeter imf used in @xcite would lower the average @xmath3 @xmath10 ratios by a factor of @xmath191 .",
    "a simple interpretation of these results is that gauging the importance of current or recent star formation on the galaxy luminosities , even in the rest - frame near - ir , depends on the observations of the full uv - to - near - ir sed of the galaxy .",
    "that is , one can not go directly from near - ir luminosity to stellar mass without knowledge of the likely contribution of young stars to that luminosity , which can only come from measurements at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the region of the spectrum that is most sensitive to the ratio between the current star formation and the integral of past star formation is between the uv and the visual , conveniently measured by the observed @xmath35 color in the current sample .",
    "this point is illustrated in figure [ fig : rmkvm ] , which shows that the inferred stellar mass is remarkably well - correlated with @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , the correlation between @xmath35 color and inferred stellar mass is almost as significant as the correlation between stellar mass and @xmath208 using a spearman test , the significance of the correlations are 5.9@xmath53 and 6.4@xmath53 , respectively  and more significant than the correlation between stellar mass and rest - frame @xmath209 m absolute magnitude @xmath210 .",
    "one implication of this result is that , in the absence of irac data , it may be more effective to use @xmath35 color rather then @xmath7 flux to select @xmath14 galaxies with large stellar masses .",
    "another implication is that there are few galaxies that have large inferred stellar masses at @xmath14 without showing evidence for long star - formation histories ( cf .",
    "* ) that are suggested by red rest - frame 2000  6500   colors .",
    "of course , caution is required in assessing the true significance of correlations that are based on the model results and not on directly measured quantities ; such is the case for all stellar mass estimates . to some extent",
    "the results in this section simply reflect how the observed sed is used to infer stellar mass by the modeling software , as a single smoothly declining or continuous episode of star formation that dominates the emission at all wavelengths from rest - frame uv through near - ir .",
    "in such a framework , the ratio of rest - frame uv to optical or near - ir light indicates the stellar @xmath10 in a fairly robust manner ( see section  [ sec : modsysunc ] ) . we can obtain a different result for the stellar mass if we instead understand the galaxy uv - to - near - ir sed as the superposition of a young , roughly continuous episode of star formation and an old burst that peaked sometime in the past . in the most extreme case of a maximally - old burst and a very young ( @xmath155  myr ) continuous episode , the old burst will dominate the rest - frame near - ir light , the young episode will dominate the emission at rest - frame uv wavelengths , and the maximum possible stellar mass will be inferred from the rest - frame near - ir luminosities . while this scenario is rather unrealistic , it does provide an extreme upper limit on the stellar mass implied by the rest - frame near - ir light .",
    "less extreme multiple - component models provide a natural representation of the episodic star - formation histories that arise in a hierarchical model of galaxy formation , and will always result in _ larger _ stellar mass estimates than those derived from the single - component modeling presented thus far in this work .    in order to set a rough upper limit on the stellar masses implied by the broad - band seds , we used a technique very similar to that of @xcite , which is designed to infer the maximum @xmath10 ratio from the rest - frame near - ir data points .",
    "this method accounts for most of the light at those wavelengths with a maximally - old burst , on top of which is superimposed a young stellar population that accounts for most of the rest - frame uv emission .",
    "the ages of the maximally old models range from 2.2 - 4.3  gyr for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we first fit a young ( @xmath155  myr ) csf model to the observed photometry , normalizing this model to the @xmath29 magnitude .",
    "we then subtracted this young model from the observed photometry , normalized the maximally old @xmath128  myr burst to the residual irac magnitudes , and summed the stellar mass from the two components .",
    "this sum is dominated by the mass of the old component , and is typically @xmath211 times larger than the single - component mass .",
    "the correlation between @xmath208 and stellar mass remains significant at the same level as for the single - component models . while @xmath35 color is still significantly correlated with stellar mass ( at the @xmath212 level )",
    ", the correlation is less significant than for the case of the single - component models discussed above .",
    "specifically , there is much more scatter among objects with blue @xmath35 colors , for which the @xmath10 can change the most using this type of modeling . for objects with @xmath205 ,",
    "the inferred @xmath10 and the correlation between stellar mass and @xmath35 color are fairly insensitive to the type of model used .",
    "it is easy to see that the amount of additional stellar mass that could be `` hidden '' by the current star formation episode is strongly dependent on the observed ratio of uv to optical / near - ir light . for the bluest objects , the ratio of true stellar mass to inferred stellar mass could be @xmath213 while redder galaxies ( except in extreme cases of dust obscuration ) could not hide much additional stellar mass . for the galaxies in the sample with the largest stellar masses derived from single - component fits , the two component modeling provides stellar mass upper limits only @xmath214% higher than the original estimates .",
    "thus , in general , objects which already have large inferred stellar masses and old inferred ages can not be much altered by more extreme assumptions , while objects that are completely dominated by the current episode of star formation ( these would tend to be galaxies with very young inferred ages ) could be more massive by factors as large as @xmath215 .",
    "the typical bx / md galaxy , which is between these extremes , probably has a true stellar mass that is a factor of @xmath216 larger than the value inferred from population synthesis modeling .",
    "finally , this decomposition of the sed into young and maximally - old components provides a fairly robust ( but extreme ) upper limit to the stellar mass consistent with the observed photometry , since more realistic , longer current star - formation episodes , would make an increasing contribution to the rest - frame near - ir light , and more realistic past bursts would occur at @xmath217 and have smaller @xmath10 ratios .",
    "as described above , there is one object , md157 , whose spectrum shows clear signatures of agn activity in the far - uv ( strong c  iv and he  ii emission as well as a broad lyman @xmath93 line ) .",
    "in addition , md157 is extremely bright in the irac-4 band ( ab mag of 18.51 ; see table 2 ) , such that obtaining a reasonable fit to its sed using stellar populations required excluding the 8@xmath8 m data point .",
    "two other objects , md174 and md94 , have rest - frame optical spectra indicative of agn ( both have h@xmath93/[nii]@xmath218 , and broad h@xmath93 with @xmath219  km  s@xmath220 ) .",
    "all three objects exhibit significantly redder than average @xmath35 colors , ranging from @xmath221 and best - fit stellar masses ranging from @xmath222 to @xmath223 .",
    "an important question is how much the presence of the agn affects the stellar mass estimates .",
    "the large stellar masses are inferred because of the bright rest - frame near - ir photometry and the very red rest - frame uv / optical and uv / near - ir colors , but if a dusty agn were dominating the rest - ir part of the sed , these stellar mass inferences could be erroneous .",
    "a large fraction of other similarly bright and red @xmath224 galaxies having relevant spectroscopic measurements also indicate the presence of agn .",
    "for example , 4 of the 7 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the fires survey @xcite presented by @xcite exhibit uv and/or optical signatures of agn activity ( high ionization uv lines , broad h@xmath93 and h@xmath93/[nii ] line ratios near unity ) , similar to md157 , md174 , and md94 .",
    "it is difficult to know whether agn activity leads to erroneously large stellar mass estimates , or whether it is preferentially objects that have already accumulated large stellar masses that tend to harbor significant agn activity .",
    "when the agn is not obviously energetically dominant in the observed - frame mid - ir , we suspect that the stellar mass estimates are probably reasonable ; for objects like md157 , which is obvious as an agn in both the rest - frame far - uv and near - ir , it is probably safest to assume that the stellar mass has been over - estimated using sed fitting .",
    "there are other objects that appear to have fluxes at 8@xmath8 m that are significantly in excess of that expected from the sed modeling ( e.g. , bx756 , bx535 , md69 , bx505 , bx581 , bx561 , bx523 ) but where we do not have any obvious spectroscopic evidence for the presence of an agn .",
    "it is conceivable that these mid - ir excesses could be due to obscured agn activity ; deep chandra images of this field could help resolve this question .",
    "we have seen above that modeling of the broad - band seds of @xmath14 star forming galaxies has significant limitations , even with spectroscopic redshifts and when longer - wavelength data are available for direct measurement of the rest - frame near - ir light .",
    "we have shown that reasonably consistent stellar mass estimates are obtained independent of the exact form of the star formation history , but that this consistency should be viewed with caution because of the fact that a robust episode of star formation can change the inferred @xmath10 by a factor of several , even at rest - frame @xmath191 @xmath8 m .",
    "one obtains increasingly reliable estimates of the total stellar mass of a galaxy as the integral of star formation over the lifetime of the galaxy exceeds that in the past several hundred myr by a factor of a few . in the most reliable cases , where the uv light is far surpassed by the emission at rest - frame optical and near - ir wavelengths ,",
    "the inferred stellar mass does not depend very strongly on whether a smooth or episodic prescription is used to model the way in which the integrated stellar mass accumulated as a function of time . when the rest - frame uv luminosity is more comparable to rest - frame optical and near - ir luminosities , however , it is inevitable that the stellar masses inferred from photometric techniques will reflect the typical stellar mass produced in an episode of star formation , perhaps caused by a merger or accretion event over the course of the last few hundred myr , and not the total stellar mass .",
    "a corollary to the above arguments is that it is most likely one would measure large stellar masses ( using the type of modeling described in this paper ) when the current rate of star formation is significantly smaller than the past average .",
    "otherwise , most of the rest - frame near - ir and optical light will be ascribed to the current star - formation episode , which has much smaller @xmath10 even in the irac bands .",
    "these are not new arguments ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though the inclusion of irac wavelengths to constrain the rest - frame near - ir emission places them on a more robust footing , and the larger range of galaxy properties observed in the current sample highlights the important trends more clearly .",
    "the concept of episodic star formation informs the above discussion .",
    "while such variable star - formation histories appear a reasonable representation of the build - up of stellar mass in galaxies at high redshift , simply based on general consideration of the hierarchical model of galaxy formation in which merging ( and merger - induced star formation ) plays a large role , we also find direct evidence from the galaxies in our sample .",
    "specifically , we can obtain interesting constraints on the redshift at which the onset of star formation occurred for the galaxies in our sample , despite large systematic uncertainties in the stellar population ages ( section  [ sec : modsysunc ] ) .",
    "the maximum stellar population age is obtained for a given set of rest - frame uv to near - ir colors when a continuous star - formation history is used , so we can use the csf results to infer the earliest redshifts at which the current episodes of star formation could begin ( cf .",
    "the median csf age for the sample is @xmath225  myr . using the redshift and csf age distributions",
    "we find that the current episode of star formation had not begun yet at @xmath226 for at least @xmath227% ( 46/72 ) of the galaxies in the sample .",
    "the true fraction is probably higher , since csf models provide only an upper limit on the age of the stellar population dominating the current star - formation episode .",
    "therefore , we find that the majority of galaxies in our sample have young ages for the current episode of star formation compared to the age of the universe at @xmath3 , allowing the possibility of much older previous bursts of star formation . relatively young inferred ages would naturally arise in a picture of episodic star - formation .",
    "a related point is that selecting on the basis of far - uv properties , as we have done for the bx / md sample , connects only obliquely to stellar mass .",
    "one might expect that galaxies would have to attain a particular total mass threshold before they could support star formation detectable at the apparent magnitude limit of the survey , but once that threshold is exceeded , a combination of extinction ( which is probably star - formation rate dependent ; e.g. , @xcite ) and scatter in sfr per unit total ( or stellar ) mass might `` randomize '' the mix of galaxy properties included in the sample . indeed , as shown in figure  [ fig : r_vs_m ] , we find that there is no hint of a correlation between @xmath228 and inferred stellar mass , as was found previously in the @xmath229 lbg sample of @xcite .    these issues",
    "make it particularly difficult to measure the total stellar mass that has formed by a particular redshift @xcite , or to make a detailed comparison of the stellar mass of even similarly - selected galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "for example , analysis of the spatial clustering of @xmath230 lbgs and @xmath3 bx galaxies @xcite suggests that correlation length of lbg descendants at @xmath3 would be similar to the observed bx correlation length , with the implication that @xmath3 lbg descendants reside in dark matter halos in the same mass range as those hosting bx galaxies .",
    "it is therefore of interest also to compare the stellar mass distribution of spectroscopically - confirmed bx / md objects with that of @xmath69 lbgs from the sample of @xcite .",
    "a direct evolutionary comparison between the stellar mass distributions for @xmath3 and @xmath230 uv - selected samples is not straightforward for many reasons .",
    "most importantly , while there is little doubt that the objects at @xmath3 and @xmath230 with large inferred masses and ages really are massive and old ( see section  [ sec : discussmassive ] ) , the modeling results likely represent lower limits on the stellar masses for more typical objects in both samples , where the current star formation is producing enough optical and near - ir light to potentially mask previous generations of stars .",
    "if star formation is episodic , as seems quite likely on many grounds , then it seems possible in principle that the same galaxy could be measured at different times , but the _ inferred _ stellar mass might not even be a monotonically increasing function of time .",
    "similarly , it might be difficult to trace the evolution of stellar mass during the epoch when most galaxies are still very actively star - forming .    bearing all of these concerns in mind , we now summarize the inferred properties of typical uv - selected galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "we then turn in some detail to the most massive and oldest galaxies in the sample , for which we obtain robust total stellar mass measurements , and show how these massive galaxies provide plausible progenitors for passive galaxies identified at @xmath231 .",
    "finally , we make a general comment about the relationships among galaxy populations selected with different photometric criteria .",
    "the results of this paper suggest that the typical @xmath232 `` bx '' galaxy has a stellar mass of @xmath233 m@xmath108 , a number that could possibly be higher by a factor of @xmath234 without affecting the observed seds .",
    "although the length of time stars have been forming in individual galaxies is not well - determined by the modeling , @xcite show that galaxies within the significant over - density at @xmath68 are older and contain more stellar mass on average than those in lower - density environments .",
    "it is very clear from these results that even at @xmath235 the star - formation history is strongly dependent on large scale environment more so than on the particular redshift at which the galaxies are observed .",
    "the typical current star - formation rate is @xmath79 myr@xmath220 @xcite , although unobscured star formation down to @xmath236 myr@xmath220 could make it into the sample , and we know that among the bx sample lurk sub - mm sources that have implied sfr of up to @xmath237 myr@xmath220 @xcite .",
    "uv - selected galaxies that are also optically bright ( @xmath238 ) have typical inferred sfr higher by a factor of @xmath236 @xcite .",
    "the space density of galaxies similar to those discussed in this paper is @xmath239 mpc@xmath240 at @xmath241 @xcite .",
    "the co - moving correlation length of the uv - selected galaxies at @xmath14 is @xmath242 h@xmath220mpc @xcite , implying that the typical galaxy lives in a dark matter halo of mass @xmath243 m. assuming that the galaxies have a baryon fraction that is the same as the universal value , the estimated mass in baryons associated with the halo is @xmath244 m , suggesting that on average roughly 10% of the baryons have been converted into stars .",
    "consideration of the expected evolution of the clustering properties of the uv - selected galaxies suggests that by @xmath245 they will be found mainly among early - type galaxies , and will have completed most of their star formation .",
    "the most massive examples will have completed their star formation even earlier , and exhibit significantly stronger clustering than the average uv - selected galaxies at @xmath14 @xcite . as discussed further in section  [",
    "sec : discussmassive ] and other recent work , the @xmath246 gyr between @xmath14 and @xmath247 marks the transition of a large fraction of massive galaxies from strongly star forming to largely quiescent @xcite .",
    "the most massive galaxies in the current sample , with stellar masses @xmath248 , can not contain significant additional stellar mass that is masked by the current episode of star formation .",
    "we obtain roughly the same stellar mass estimate regardless of whether a single - component model is used to fit the colors , or a young current star - formation episode super - imposed on an old past burst . in the context of simple ,",
    "single - component models , these galaxies also have seds that provide significant constraints on the star - formation history . unlike the majority of galaxies in the hs1700 sample , for which we find that all or most @xmath115 values are consistent at the 95.4% level with the data , we can rule out models with @xmath249  myr and @xmath174 ( i.e. , csf ) for all but one of the galaxies with @xmath250 .",
    "more discrimination among @xmath115 values leads to interesting constraints on the duration of the star - formation episodes in these galaxies .",
    "the minimum @xmath251  myr for these five galaxies implies minimum ages of @xmath252  myr .",
    "the most likely value of @xmath115 however is @xmath253  gyr , based on monte carlo simulations in which @xmath115 was allowed to vary . for @xmath254  gyr ,",
    "the ages inferred for these galaxies range from @xmath255  gyr , comparable to the age of the universe at @xmath256 .",
    "the stellar masses for this subsample of galaxies are all well - constrained ( @xmath257% uncertainties ) , including the systematic uncertainty in star - formation history .    the superior constraint on star - formation history for these objects results from two factors : first , the most massive galaxies are among the brightest in the @xmath7 and irac bands also have @xmath258 .",
    "a deeper apparent magnitude limit than @xmath259 is evidently necessary to gain a complete census of the most massive galaxies at @xmath14 @xcite . ] , resulting in smaller than average @xmath35 and irac photometric uncertainties .",
    "four of the five massive galaxies with significant constraints on @xmath115 are also detected in all four irac bands , providing better constraints on the shape of the sed in the region dominated by longer - lived stars .",
    "secondly , all but one of the objects with @xmath250 have significantly redder than average @xmath35 ( and @xmath260 ) colors have best - fit models with @xmath261 , implying that they would be selected by the fires survey . ] , but average or bluer than average @xmath36 colors .",
    "the combination of blue to average @xmath36 and red @xmath35 colors indicates that the rest - frame optical and near - ir light can not be ascribed to the massive stars tracing the instantaneous star - formation rate and dominating the rest - frame uv emission , and therefore must be produced by less massive stars formed primarily in the past .",
    "since the inferred extinction correction will be small when the uv color is blue , either the star formation was much higher in the past , or the current sfr has been sustained for a very long time . if the implied csf time is older than the age of the universe , then @xmath115 models will be required to fit the data well .",
    "there are other objects in the sample with comparably small @xmath35 and irac uncertainties , but with weaker constraints on @xmath115 .",
    "an example is md94 , which has very red @xmath35 and @xmath36 colors and is inferred to have a stellar mass @xmath262 . in this case , the colors can be adequately fit by models spanning the whole range of @xmath115 , including csf , mainly because the inferred current sfr ( derived from the extremely red @xmath36 color ) is high enough to have produced the near - ir light in much less than the age of the universe , even for csf .",
    "the best - fit @xmath115 model , though , has an age that is a factor of @xmath236 shorter than the csf model , and a current sfr 3 times smaller ( however , the implied initial sfr given the age and @xmath115 values would have been 25 times larger , or 2500 m@xmath108 yr@xmath220 ! ) .",
    "we return now to the massive galaxies with superior constraints on the single - component star - formation histories . of course , a smoothly - declining star - formation history is not a very likely scenario for the build - up of stellar mass , since the star - formation rate is expected to be modulated by episodic merger and accretion events .",
    "it is not really possible to establish whether or not star formation has been sustained continuously at a detectable level over a long period of time , even for galaxies whose star formation must have begun at very high redshift . for example , in general , galaxies for which the @xmath115 models are required for a good fit to single - component models can also be adequately fit by assuming a single , early burst of star formation to produce the optical / near - ir light and a small amount of recent star formation ( with an associated stellar mass of only @xmath263% of the early burst ) that accounts for the rest - frame far - uv light . for such two - component models , there is again no unique solution , but reasonable fits to the data can be found for models where a large burst with @xmath264myr occurred at @xmath265 and the recent ( smaller ) burst is less than 100 myr old m@xmath108 yr@xmath220 over the first 200 myr of the galaxy s life , e.g. between @xmath266 and @xmath267 . ] . while we can not distinguish between smooth or episodic star - formation histories , the estimates of total stellar mass derived from two - component models agree very well with those obtained from the simple single - component fits . for these massive and old galaxies ,",
    "the inferred total stellar mass is therefore a robust quantity .    in an analysis of the stellar populations of uv - selected @xmath268 galaxies in the _ hubble deep field _",
    "( hdf - n ) @xcite found no comparably massive and old objects .",
    "the small ratio between the typical inferred star - formation timescale for these hdf lbgs and the time interval between @xmath268 was used to motivate a scenario of multiple , intermittent star - formation episodes with a duty cycle of @xmath269  gyr . as described in the beginning of section  [ sec : discussion ] , most of the current sample can in fact be described in this manner .",
    "in retrospect , it is not surprising that the sample of @xcite did not contain any @xmath270 m@xmath108 galaxies in the 5.0 arcmin@xmath2 hdf - n field , despite a similar optical magnitude limit in the hdf spectroscopic sub - sample .",
    "we found only 6 with spectroscopic redshifts in the entire 65 arcmin@xmath2 wirc field .",
    "since the spectroscopic completeness of our sample is @xmath271% , the approximate surface density of objects in the redshift interval @xmath272 is @xmath273 arcmin@xmath32 , so that one would expect @xmath274 such massive and old galaxies in an area with the size of the hdf - n given spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "in fact , @xcite have pointed out the discrepancy in the number of galaxies with red near - ir colors in the hdf - n versus their fires field in the hdf - s , with the hdf - n having only 10 - 20% of the numbers in the hdf - s .",
    "given that the galaxies with large stellar mass are strongly clustered ( @xcite , @xcite ) the variance between small survey areas is expected to be large for such rare objects .",
    "while massive and mature galaxies represent a small fraction by number of the bx / md population ( 6/72 with @xmath275 , 5 of which also have @xmath276  the age of the universe ) , their estimated space density , @xmath277 , is similar to the space density of the massive star - forming galaxies from the k20 survey presented by @xcite at @xmath278 , and also the massive galaxies with old and passive stellar populations presented by @xcite and @xcite at @xmath279 . in both of the latter papers ,",
    "the authors suggest that the progenitors of the old and passive galaxies are to be found among submillimeter- and near - ir - selected samples at @xmath19 . here",
    "we show that the most massive and mature objects in the @xmath280 uv - selected sample could quite plausibly be the progenitors of massive and passive systems at @xmath281 . to make this comparison , we adopt star formation histories that are consistent both with those used to fit the near - ir selected massive and passive galaxies by @xcite and @xcite and with the seds of all 5 of the bx / md massive and old galaxies at @xmath282 .",
    "we then evolve these models forward in time to the mean redshifts of the @xcite and @xcite samples , compute the average @xmath7 magnitudes , @xmath283 and @xmath284 colors , stellar masses , and star - formation rates , and compare them with the properties of the passive galaxies .",
    "@xcite present four galaxies at @xmath285 , with @xmath286 , @xmath287 , stellar masses ranging from @xmath288 , and a space density of @xmath289 .",
    "when a declining model with @xmath290  gyr is used to fit the colors , the associated ages and formation redshifts are @xmath193  gyr , and @xmath291 , respectively .",
    "if we apply a @xmath290gyr model to the massive bx / md seds at @xmath292 , and then evolve them forward to @xmath293 , they would have @xmath294 , @xmath295 , @xmath296 , ages ranging from 1.9 - 2.3 gyr , and sfrs of @xmath297 @xmath298 , making them fainter than @xmath299 .",
    "we find a similar level of agreement between the bx / md models evolved to @xmath300 and the parameters of the 5 objects in @xcite ( their table 1 ) for which a @xmath301  gyr model was used to fit the spectra and colors .",
    "thus , extrapolating star formation histories for the massive bx / mds forward in time would make them plausibly consistent with the passive galaxies in the near - ir selected samples observed at somewhat lower redshift .",
    "equivalently , if the bx / md examples are interpreted as massive old bursts with a small amount of recent star formation superposed , by @xmath302 they would have essentially the same characteristics as the passive galaxies provided that the current episode of star formation ( i.e. , as observed at @xmath256 ) lasts for less than the @xmath303  myr between @xmath282 and @xmath304 .",
    "the specific values of the timescale over which star formation occurs , and the redshift at which star formation begins , are not well - determined because of the systematic uncertainties inherent in stellar population synthesis modeling .",

    "while additional progenitors of the @xmath305 massive and passive systems may be found among submillimeter- and @xmath306 color - selected samples , the uv - selected sample at @xmath282 must contain a significant fraction of the objects that will look like elliptical galaxies at @xmath305 .",

    "the most massive and optically brightest galaxies in the uv - selected samples appear to have similar masses , chemical abundances , star - formation rates , inferred ages , and clustering properties as galaxies selected in the near - ir by either apparent brightness or optical / ir color .",

    "that rest - uv selection is incomplete with respect to all galaxies present at similar redshifts has been shown clearly by the near - ir selected gdds , k20 , and fires surveys as discussed above , as well as by sub - mm selected surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the point is that it is relatively easy for objects to come and go from a uv - selected surveys on timescales much shorter than a hubble time at the relevant redshifts , independent of their past ( or future ) star - formation histories .",
    "most of the existing evidence , and some theoretical studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , suggests that at @xmath311 , relatively massive galaxies ( @xmath312 m@xmath108 ) are `` uv - selectable '' using criteria similar to those employed in the current sample @xmath313% of the time .",
    "while such samples would be significantly incomplete with respect to all galaxies at a given stellar mass , they may not be entirely missing any type of galaxy .",
    "the fraction that happens to have enough uv light to be selected has significant advantages : spectroscopy is easy in both the far - uv and optical ( rest frame ) .",
    "these observations allow for more detailed astrophysical studies , and an evaluation of the dependence of galaxy properties on large - scale environment as in @xcite .",
    "the recent success of the spectroscopic follow - up of sub - mm - selected galaxies @xcite has benefited from exactly the same advantage : even uv light that is inconsequential compared to the bolometric luminosity allows spectroscopic measurements , leading to more detailed astrophysical insight .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the broad - band seds of a sample of 72 rest - uv selected , spectroscopically confirmed , star forming galaxies at @xmath314 in a @xmath315 by 8.5 arcmin field centered on hs1700 + 643 .",
    "this sample of galaxies is broadly representative of galaxies selected with well - calibrated photometric pre - selection using rest - uv colors : all of the spectroscopic data were obtained without consideration of the longer - wavelength properties .",
    "we used extensive ground - based photometry from 0.35 - 2.15 @xmath8 m and deep _",
    "spitzer_/irac data probing the rest - frame near - ir , together with information from optical and near - ir spectroscopy , to produce an unprecedented data set that allows the most robust statements to date concerning the physical state of galaxies at @xmath14 , in particular their stellar masses .",
    "\\1 . using population synthesis to model the stellar populations , we find that the inferred stellar mass distribution of the sample is reasonably well - described by a log - normal distribution : @xmath316 and that the result is essentially unchanged if a constant star formation history is assumed instead of the best - fitting exponentially declining star - formation history",
    ". the typical uncertainty in stellar mass , including variations in the assumed form of the star - formation history , is @xmath178% .",
    "sub - samples of the galaxies with brighter observed @xmath7 ( 2.15@xmath8 m ) flux have larger inferred stellar mass ; 8% of the sample has inferred stellar mass @xmath317 m. we found that fitting seds to simultaneously determine photometric redshifts and stellar population parameters leads to large uncertainties in both , and tends to over - estimate the inferred stellar mass ; thus we use only the sample with spectroscopic identifications .",
    "the use of the _ spitzer_/irac fluxes , which measure the rest - frame near - ir light from the galaxies and thus should yield the strongest available constraints on stellar mass , provides a marked improvement in the estimates of the stellar mass of individual galaxies , reducing the formal uncertainties by a factor of @xmath6 relative to estimates based on photometry that extends only to the ground - based @xmath7 band .",
    "however , we find that the longer wavelength data do not change the results significantly : the total stellar mass inferred for the entire sample of 72 galaxies is changed by only 15% depending on whether the _ spitzer _ data are used for the modeling or not . at the redshifts spanned by our sample , there is a tendency to over - estimate slightly the stellar mass when the @xmath7 band is the longest wavelength observed , because of contamination in the @xmath7 band from @xmath96 emission .",
    "the lack of strong constraints on the form of the star - formation history remains a problem for most of the galaxies in the sample , even when using simple , single - component models .",
    "ages , exponential time constants , and extinction / sfr are largely degenerate with respect to each other ; however , as found in previous work , the inferred stellar masses remain largely unaffected .",
    "external constraints can be used to rule out parts of parameter space that are otherwise allowed by the sed fits .",
    "while the inferred stellar mass is correlated with the flux at 2 @xmath8 m , the inferred stellar mass - to - light ratios can vary by a factor of @xmath84 at a given @xmath7-band luminosity ( rest - frame r at the mean redshift of the sample ) .",
    "even at an observed wavelength of 4.5@xmath8 m ( rest - frame 1.4 @xmath8 m ) the inferred @xmath10 varies by a factor of 15 . at both wavelengths ( rest - frame 0.65 and 1.4 @xmath8 m ) ,",
    "the highest inferred @xmath10 are similar to those of local galaxies , but the average @xmath10 is a factor of at least 5 and 2.5 smaller , respectively .",
    "thus , at these redshifts , even rest near - ir luminosities are by themselves a relatively poor proxy for stellar mass ; the entire sed , from the uv to the near - ir , is essential . in particular , the conversion from rest - frame near - ir luminosity to stellar mass is strongly correlated with the observed @xmath35 color ( rest - frame @xmath318  ) which in the context of the models considered is a crude measure of the ratio of past to current star formation .",
    "even with irac rest - frame near - ir information , there remains the possibility of significant systematic underestimates of the stellar mass using single - component sed - fitting techniques ; the magnitude of this effect depends sensitively on the shape of the sed . for objects that are red in their uv / optical and uv / near - ir colors , the mass inferred from sed",
    "fitting is unlikely to underestimate the stellar mass by more than a few tens of percent , while the bluest objects in the sample could have total stellar masses that are as much as a factor of @xmath215 larger than inferred ( in the case of the most extreme assumed star - formation histories ) .",
    "a typical object in our sample could be `` hiding '' up to a factor of @xmath236 more stellar mass than inferred by the modeling .",
    "thus , for star - forming galaxies at high redshift , reasonably precise estimates of stellar mass are possible only for objects that are nearly finished forming stars , or caught in a relatively quiescent state between episodes of star formation .",
    "all other estimates should probably be considered as lower limits , possibly reflecting the typical stellar mass formed during a star - formation episode rather than the integrated stellar mass .",
    "we have shown that the most massive galaxies in the uv - selected sample , with @xmath270 m , could plausibly evolve by @xmath304 into the high redshift `` passive '' galaxies recently identified from near - ir selected spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the most likely star - formation histories for these uv - selected examples indicate that they began forming stars at very early times and that their star - formation rates were considerably higher in the past , quite similar to what is found for the near - ir selected galaxies . taken together with the similarities in space density , stellar mass , chemical abundances , and clustering properties , galaxies with similarly large stellar masses",
    "should probably be treated as a single `` population '' regardless of the method used to discover them . in most cases , the uv light which brings them into the sample represents a small fraction of the stellar mass assembly .",
