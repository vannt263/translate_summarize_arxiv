    "in riemannian quantum gravity and in the search for holographic dualities relating the bulk gravitational physics to boundary gauge theories one often encounters the dirichlet problem of finding one or more compact @xmath2-dimensional riemannian manifolds @xmath3 with a given @xmath4-dimensional closed manifold @xmath5 as the boundary such that @xmath6 satisfies the einstein equation with a cosmological constant term or appropriate matter fields and such that the metric @xmath7 is induced on @xmath8 . a classical solution @xmath3",
    "is then referred to as an infilling geometry for the boundary @xmath9 .",
    "such solutions provide semi - classical approximations to the path integral and are the starting point for quantum computations .    for a given boundary with a metric finding all infilling solutions",
    ", however , is a formidably complex task even in the case of pure gravity .",
    "however , certain simplifying features usually arise from physical principles which make the problem more tractable .",
    "one often assumes @xmath7 to have a high degree of symmetry and invariant under the action of some lie group @xmath10 and/or to have other simplifying features . also ,",
    "possible infilling geometries are often restricted to the class of cohomogeneity one manifolds under the proper action of @xmath10 , i.e. , dim(@xmath11 .",
    "the principal orbits of such a solution will then share the topology and symmetry of @xmath9 .",
    "however , one can consider metric which are cohomogeneity one under the group action of @xmath12 provided @xmath13 expands to @xmath10 on @xmath9 .",
    "for example one can fill in an @xmath14-invariant @xmath15 boundary with biaxial bianchi - ix merics whose principal orbits are in general @xmath16-invariant . with only a cosmological constant term and in the absence of matter fields the assumption of cohomogeneity in either case reduces the dirichlet problem to a set of ordinary differential equations arising from the einstein equation to be solved subject to the boundary data given by the specification of @xmath17 and the condition of regularity in the interior . in many cases ( for example , when @xmath10 or @xmath13 has a sufficient degree of symmetry ) the general solution of the set of ordinary differential equations and the manifolds over which they can be extended , completely or partially , are known in advance .",
    "the problem is then equivalent to the problem of the isometric embedding of a given manifold @xmath9 into known manifolds subject to the condition of regularity for the part(s ) of the manifolds enclosed by @xmath9 .",
    "in this paper we study the dirichlet problem for boundaries which are @xmath18-bundles over some compact manifolds . in general relativity such boundaries often arise in gravitational thermodynamics .",
    "the classic example is that of the trivial bundle @xmath19 .",
    "manifolds with complete ricci - flat metrics admitting such boundaries are known ; they are the euclideanised schwarzschild metric and the flat metric with periodic identification .",
    "it is known from the work of york @xcite that there are in general two or no schwarzschild solutions depending on whether the squashing ( the ratio of the radius of the @xmath18-fibre to that of the @xmath20-base ) is below or above a critical value .",
    "when such solutions exist , the solution of the boundary - value problem is given by finding the @xmath21-geometries by solving for the masses of the two black holes as functions of the two radii @xcite .",
    "among other results presented in this paper , we will show that it is possible to find analytic solutions of the infilling schwarzschild geometries in arbitrary dimension by using methods not very well - known in the physics community .",
    "york s results in 4-dimension extend readily to higher dimensions .    in the case of non - trivial bundles ,",
    "the simplest example arises in quantum cosmology in which the boundary is a compact @xmath15 , i.e. , a non - trivial @xmath18 bundle over @xmath20 . in the case of zero cosmological",
    "constant , regular 4-metrics admitting such an @xmath15 boundary are the taub - nut @xcite and taub - bolt @xcite metrics having zero and two - dimensional ( regular ) fixed point sets of the @xmath0 action respectively",
    ". these metrics are therefore topologically distinct although their principal orbits share the same topology and symmetry .",
    "as we will see later in the paper such an @xmath15-boundary can be filled in with a unique taub - nut solution and two taub - bolt solutions in general . however , in either case the boundary has to satisfy certain inequalities .",
    "another regular metric with non - trivial @xmath18-bundle boundaries ( which are not topologically @xmath15 ) is the eguchi - hanson metric in which case the periodicity of the @xmath22-fibre is half of that in the case of an @xmath15 boundary ( hence the boundary is topologically @xmath23 ) .",
    "this metric also has a singular orbit , i.e. , an @xmath20 bolt .",
    "as we will see below such a boundary can be filled in with a unique ( or no ) eguchi - hanson solution depending on its geometric data .",
    "regular cohomogeneity one ricci - flat metrics in higher dimensions with principal orbits that admit circle actions , i.e. , metrics which provide the generalisations to the four dimensional metrics above , are known @xcite .",
    "we will discuss them and the conditions for their regularity in detail in section @xmath24 after describing the four dimensional cases first .",
    "as we will see , possibilities proliferate as one goes higher in dimension . naturally to know how the 4-dimensional picture changes in higher dimensions one seeks a method which avoids details coming from dimensionality . the existence and non - existence of infilling solutions and , more importantly",
    ", the number of infilling solutions as the boundary data is varied will be discussed in section 3 . as will be shown , despite the form of the metrics being rather complicated functions of the radial coordinate ( i.e. , the coordinate parametrizing the orbit spaces ) , it is possible to treat the taub - nut and the taub - bolt metrics generically . in the case of trivial bundles",
    "we have been able to solve for the infilling schwarzschild geometries in arbitrary dimension .",
    "this is described in section 4 .",
    "it is possible to find the infilling eguchi - hanson metrics as well .",
    "however , the explicit solutions for the taub - nut and taub - bolt infilling metrics can only be found in lower dimensions using ordinary algebraic methods .",
    "the higher dimensional solutions are discussed in section 5 and can be solved using insights provided by the 4-dimensional solutions .",
    "two classic issues in riemannian geometry which the dirichlet boundary - value problem above connects us to are discussed in section @xmath25 .",
    "one of them is the question of convexity ( i.e. , whether the second fundamental form of the boundary which is determined by the infilling geometry has positive eigenvalues or not ) of the boundary and its possible ramifications for quantum gravity .",
    "the other issue is given by minkowski s celebrated isoperimetric inequality which in ordinary language tells us that in flat space for a given surface area the greatest volume enclosed is that of a sphere .",
    "we find analogues of minkowski s inequalities for all of the above spaces and discuss them in detail .",
    "in four dimensions , all ricci - flat metrics that admit circle actions can be obtained as special cases of the taub - nut metric .",
    "the taub - nut metric is a two - parameter ricci - flat metric and is invariant under the group action of @xmath26 , i.e. , biaxial bianchi - ix type .",
    "the euclidean metric is usually written in the following coordinates : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two parameters . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the usual coordinates on @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , is the coordinate parametrizing the @xmath18 fibre . for @xmath36 the period of @xmath37",
    "is @xmath38 and hence the surfaces of constant @xmath39 are topologically @xmath40 .    the general form of the metric ( [ tb ] )",
    ", however , is only valid for a coordinate patch for which @xmath41 . in general , @xmath42 will have two roots : @xmath43 at the roots the metric degenerates to that of a round @xmath33 , and each such root therefore corresponds to a two - dimensional set of fixed points of the killing vector field @xmath44 and hence are singular orbits .",
    "however , for @xmath45 the roots coincide , i.e. , @xmath46 in which case the fixed - point set is zero - dimensional as the two - sphere then collapses to a point .",
    "such two- and zero - dimensional fixed point sets have been given the names `` bolts '' and `` nuts '' respectively @xcite .",
    "for a bolt to be a regular point of the metric , the metric has to `` close '' smoothly near it , such that the subspace of @xmath47 has the metric of @xmath48 . this can happen provided one gives @xmath37 the appropriate period which is equivalent to imposing the following condition @xcite : @xmath49 for a nut the metric ( [ tb ] ) is regular for @xmath36 and approaches the 4-dimensional flat metric near it ( see below ) .",
    "the coordinate @xmath39 ranges continuously from the nut or bolt till , in principle , another root of @xmath42 or to infinity . in the latter case the metric can be defined over a complete manifold @xmath50 often called an instanton .      setting @xmath51 in ( [ tb ] ) , one obtains hawking s taub - nut instanton @xcite : @xmath52 the riemann curvature tensor of the metric is self - dual  @xmath53 . as already mentioned , the metric has a nut at @xmath54 and is regular for @xmath36 , i.e. , if @xmath37 has a period of @xmath38 ; the level - surfaces of the regular metric are therefore topologically @xmath40 with a biaxial bianchi - ix metric on it  a property that makes the metric interesting for cosmology .",
    "another interesting property of the metric is that it is khler . in the mathematical literature , because of its many special properties , this metric appears in many different contexts .",
    "the metric is asymptotically flat and the complete metric , @xmath55 , i.e. , the self - dual taub - nut or taub - nut instanton has the topology of @xmath56 . to avoid confusion due to divergent conventions in the literature",
    ", we will refer to this metric ( and its higher dimensional generalisations to be described in the next section ) as taub - nut metrics to distinguish them from the taub - bolt metrics that have two - dimensional regular fixed - point sets and will reserve the word taub - nut for the whole two - parameter family which includes other regular and singular metrics .",
    "the taub - bolt @xcite metric is the only other regular metric for @xmath36 , i.e. , has level surfaces that are squashed spheres : @xmath57 here @xmath39 ranges from @xmath58 to infinity .",
    "the two - dimensional fixed - point set of the killing vector @xmath59 is a regular bolt as one can check from ( [ dercond ] ) .",
    "this is not self - dual unlike the taub - nut metric although it is also asymptotically flat .",
    "due to the bolt , the complete metric has a different topology and is defined over a manifold of topology @xmath60 , i.e. , of @xmath61 with its nut removed .",
    "as first observed by page @xcite , for the degenerate case @xmath62 , one can obtain the schwarzschild metric by taking the limit @xmath63 and @xmath64 while keeping @xmath65 fixed @xcite : @xmath66 here @xmath67 and replaces the @xmath37 coordinate in the previous two examples .",
    "the metric has a bolt singularity at @xmath68 which can be made regular by identifying the coordinate @xmath69 with a period of @xmath70 .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath39 has the range @xmath71 and constant @xmath39 slices of the regular metric have the trivial product topology of @xmath72 .",
    "the four - metric therefore has the topology of @xmath73 .",
    "the only other regular metric in this family is the eguchi - hanson metric @xcite .",
    "it is obtained by defining @xmath75 and then taking the limit @xmath76 while keeping @xmath77 constant @xcite : @xmath78 the metric is self - dual . however , since @xmath37 has period @xmath79 , the level surfaces are @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath81 and hence the metric is asymptotically locally euclidean and asymptotically looks like @xmath82 .",
    "the complete metric has the topology of @xmath83 .      in this section",
    "we briefly review the possible generalisations of the four - dimensional metrics discussed above .",
    "all of the above metrics are radial extensions of @xmath0 bundles fibred over @xmath33  a compact einstein manifold .",
    "the bundles are non - trivial except in the case of schwarzschild . in higher dimensions",
    "we therefore seek ricci - flat metrics with similar hopf bundle structure that would reduce to the above metrics in four dimensions .",
    "the case of four dimensions is special in that all such metrics are obtained as special cases of the taub - nut metric as we have seen in the previous section .",
    "however , this fortuitous situation can not exist in principle in higher dimensions as cohomogeneity one metrics with principal orbits that are the non - trivial @xmath22 bundles ( i.e. , the proposed generalisation of the taub - nut family ) and satisfying the vacuum einstein equation can only exist in even dimensions whereas the schwarzschild metric can be generalised in arbitrary dimensions ( see below ) .",
    "the higher dimensional generalisation of the taub - nut family requires the base manifold to be khler ( complex projective space for taub - nut solutions , see below ) and hence none of the metrics will be asymptotically flat or euclidean , locally or globally .",
    "with schwarzschild in higher dimensions we have more choices for the base manifold than a sphere with the usual round metric on it due to the proliferation of compact einstein manifolds / metrics in dimensions greater than two .",
    "any compact einstein manifold would suffice as the base space in this case with regularity at the bolt being achieved only through imposing correct periodicity on the fibre - coordinate .",
    "therefore the schwarzschild metrics obtained as special cases of higher dimensional taub - nut metrics form a subclass of all the possible schwarzschild metrics in that dimension . since @xmath33 is the only compact einstein manifold in two dimensions and is isomorphic to @xmath84 , in four dimensions such a coincidence is possible .      for the schwarzschild metric in @xmath2 dimensions ,",
    "one simply replaces the trivial bundle @xmath72 by @xmath85 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 gives the black hole mass @xmath88 which for @xmath89 is @xcite @xmath90 the bolt singularity at @xmath91 can be removed by periodically identifying the coordinate @xmath69 with a period @xmath92 the coordinate @xmath39 then takes values from @xmath93 to infinity and defines a complete metric over a manifold with @xmath94 topology possessing an @xmath95-dimensional fixed point set of the killing vector @xmath96 , i.e. , a bolt . for @xmath97",
    "the metric is asymptotically euclidean and in general for other choices of base manifolds are asymptotically conical with the special case @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath100 , for which it is asymptotically locally euclidean .",
    "for a recent discussion on various possibilities of base spaces for schwarzschild metrics in various dimensions and their ramifications , see @xcite .",
    "the generalised ricci - flat metrics with principal orbits which are non - trivial @xmath22 bundles were constructed in @xcite and independently in @xcite .",
    "recently they have been discussed in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "such a metric is obtained by adding a radial coordinate to the metric on the @xmath0 bundle over a compact homogeneous khler manifold @xmath30 of @xmath4 complex dimensions endowed with an einstein - khler metric @xmath101 and subjecting the @xmath102-dimensional metric to ricci - flatness .",
    "the metric on the bundle is @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a connection on the bundle such that @xmath105 is the the khler form on @xmath30 with @xmath106 parametrizing the @xmath18 fibre .",
    "the quantity @xmath107 is some function on @xmath30 .",
    "the bundle is invariant under the group action @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the symmetry of the base .",
    "however , this is not necessarily the maximal symmetry , as we will discuss later .",
    "the general ansatz for the @xmath102 dimensional space is then taken by adding a radial coordinate @xmath39 : @xmath110 the khlerian choice of @xmath30 renders the vacuum einstein equations in the simple form : @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 adding the first two equations and choosing the coordinate gauge in the form @xmath114 one finds @xmath115 with this explicit form of @xmath116 , @xmath117 is given by the integral : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is an integration constant .",
    "note that the gauge ( [ gauge ] ) is slightly superfluous .",
    "looking at ( [ tab ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath120 appears as an overall multiplicative factor .",
    "we could therefore have absorbed @xmath120 into @xmath121 .",
    "however , writing the gauge in this form would help us recover the taub - nut and taub - bolt metrics in their familiar forms by just setting @xmath120 to a constant value and setting the correct value for @xmath122 without having to redefine @xmath121 , as we will see below",
    ".    the above considerations are local and do not prescribe any periodicity on @xmath106 . as shown in @xcite , to extend the above metric globally over a manifold , as we do next , @xmath106 is required to have a period of @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a positive integer unrestricted as yet , and @xmath125 is a non - negative integer such that the first chern class of the tangent bundle on @xmath126 is divisible by @xmath125 .",
    "one can now obtain complete positive definite metrics provided one removes the possible singularities arising from the fixed - points of the killing vector @xmath127 .      the fixed point set of the killing vector @xmath127 would be zero dimensional if both @xmath128 and @xmath129 goes to zero at @xmath54 .",
    "this requires setting @xmath130 and @xmath131 in ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this will be a regular nut provided the metric near the nut approaches the flat metric .",
    "this is only possible if one choose the base manifold to be @xmath132 with the fubini - study metric on it .",
    "the principal orbits are then spheres via the standard hopf fibration of @xmath133 and hence near @xmath54 the metric approaches the flat metric on @xmath134 , i.e. , @xmath135 .",
    "note that for any other choice of compact khler base space the nut - singularity can not be removed .",
    "the period of @xmath106 is @xmath136 as @xmath137 for @xmath138 .    by setting @xmath139 and @xmath140 , note that the four dimensional self - dual taub - nut metric eq.([tn ] )",
    "can be reproduced .",
    "is @xmath141 ] in higher dimensions the solutions are higher order polynomials in @xmath39 : + @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 one can integrate @xmath146 to obtain @xmath147\\right).\\ ] ] however , this expression , while exact , consists of two terms coming from the two limits of the integral ( in which the value of the integral at the lower limit has been simplified using gamma functions ) and hence is not very useful or illuminating for practical purposes .",
    "however , it is possible to express @xmath148 as a single expression which captures the simple product form of eqs.([beta11])- ( [ beta4 ] ) . for this we will have to wait until the next section where its utility will also be demonstrated .",
    "for @xmath149 the integral @xmath150 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath39 starting from zero .",
    "any positive value of @xmath119 can therefore be matched with a unique @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath152 , we can replace eq.([beta ] ) with @xmath153 this automatically guarantees that @xmath154 .",
    "the @xmath155 dimensional set of fixed point of @xmath127 at @xmath156 forms a bolt  a singular orbit .",
    "however , this will be a regular point of the metric provided the @xmath157 sub - plane looks like an @xmath48 at @xmath156 .",
    "we now expand ( [ beta1 ] ) in powers of @xmath158 : @xmath159 recalling that @xmath106 should have a period @xmath160 , the sub - space of @xmath157 would be flat if the bolt is located at @xmath161 obviously this requires @xmath162 to be less than @xmath125",
    ". therefore there are @xmath163 bolt type solutions for any given einstein - khler base .    for @xmath1 ( therefore @xmath164 )",
    "@xmath165 note that only for @xmath36 is the asymptotic behaviour of the solution similar to that of the taub - nut solution .",
    "other @xmath166 bolt solutions , which do not have any analogues in 4-dimensions , though regular , do not have the same asymptotic behaviour . for @xmath36 ,",
    "the bolt appears at @xmath167 in four dimensions , @xmath168 in six dimensions , i.e. , at @xmath169 in @xmath102 dimensions .",
    "we here mention explicit solutions for @xmath36 , with subscripts indicating the dimensions as before : @xmath170 @xmath171 @xmath172 in the rest of the paper , unless otherwise stated , we will use taub - bolt to mean any solution for arbitrary value of @xmath124 ( which is , however , less than @xmath125 ) .",
    "also , it is important to note that for the taub - nut solutions we require the total @xmath102-dimensional space to approach flatness at the nut which is only possible if @xmath1 is the base .",
    "however , in the case of bolt - type solutions , at a bolt the metric is the product of flat @xmath173 and an einstein manifold of constant radius and hence are regular ricci - flat solutions for any choice of einstein - khler base .",
    "the periodicity of the fibre - coordinate has to be adjusted in this case depending on the value of @xmath125 which in turn will determine the locations of the bolt in each of the @xmath163 bolt solutions . in general",
    "the periodicities are different for different choices of base manifolds and the explicit form of @xmath174 will be different in each case and for each possible value of @xmath124 .",
    "however , taub - bolt would be used for all of them in the same way schwarzschild is used generically irrespective of the choice of base .",
    "apart from the @xmath163 regular bolt solutions , another regular solution exists for the degenerate case of @xmath175 by taking limits in the same way we have obtained the eguchi - hanson metric in the case of four dimensions ( see below ) . also at the limit @xmath62 one obtains the schwarzschild metric .",
    "however , these are only a subset of schwarzschild metrics in even dimensions .",
    "the taub - nut family being even dimensional can not offer any schwarzschild metric in odd dimensions .",
    "therefore one obtains only the sub - class of schwarzschild metrics with einstein - khler base in any even dimension from the taub - nut family and any odd dimensional schwarzschild metric is precluded automatically .      for the degenerate case of @xmath175",
    ", the @xmath18-fibre has a period of @xmath176 .",
    "metrics obtained by taking limits identical to four dimensional case , as described in sec .",
    "2 ( i.e. , by defining the coordinate @xmath177 and taking @xmath178 and @xmath121 both to infinity while keeping @xmath179 a finite constant ) are regular and give the generalisations to the eguchi - hanson metric .",
    "they can most conveniently be written by choosing @xmath180 .",
    "the @xmath102-dimensional metric then has the succinct form : @xmath181 the bolt at @xmath182 is regular with @xmath37 having a period of @xmath183 for which the principal orbits are @xmath184 if one chooses @xmath1 with the fubini - study metric as the base .",
    "the metric ( [ egu ] ) is then einstein - khler and was first found by calabi by abstract geometric methods @xcite and was later found by directly solving the monge - ampre equation in @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath30 can be any einstein - khler manifold ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in the dirichlet problem one seeks to obtain non - singular solutions @xmath3 which fill in a given boundary @xmath5 such that @xmath185 and @xmath186 . in our case",
    "a boundary is an @xmath18 bundle over a compact einstein manifold with @xmath7 having the form @xmath187 where @xmath128 and @xmath129  the radii of the base manifold and the @xmath18-fibre respectively  are known quantities and constitute what we will be referring to as the boundary data .",
    "the boundary @xmath9 is invariant under the group @xmath188 where @xmath109 is the symmetry group of the base manifold @xmath30 .",
    "however , @xmath10 is not necessarily the maximal symmetry of @xmath9 .",
    "for example when the boundary is an @xmath22 bundle over @xmath20 , @xmath10 may enlarge from @xmath189 to @xmath190 depending on the values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 and the periodicity of the fibre - coordinate .",
    "the same is true for the higher dimensional metrics discussed above .    in the dirichlet problem",
    "we seek to find infilling metrics as functions of @xmath128 and @xmath129 . since we know the ricci - flat metrics that have principal orbits sharing the topology and symmetry of @xmath9 , our problem is equivalent to the isometric embedding problem of @xmath9 into known manifolds @xmath191 .",
    "when such an embedding is possible , compact part(s ) of @xmath191 cut by the hypersurface @xmath5 constitute a solution to the dirichlet problem .      for a boundary @xmath192",
    ", the pair @xmath193 constitutes the canonical boundary data with the interpretation that @xmath128 represents the radius of a spherical cavity immersed in a thermal bath with temperature @xmath194 .",
    "it is known from the work of york and others @xcite that for such canonical boundary data , apart from the obvious infilling flat - space solution with proper identification , there are in general two black hole solutions distinguished by their masses which become degenerate at a certain value of the squashing , i.e. , the ratio of the two radii @xmath195 .",
    "this can be seen in the following way .",
    "first rewrite the schwarzschild metric ( [ sch ] ) in the following form : @xmath196 where @xmath197 such that @xmath106 has unit period . with this definition one",
    "can simply read off the proper length ",
    "alternatively the radius  of the @xmath18 fibre and that of the @xmath33 base .",
    "they are : @xmath198 and @xmath199 it is easy to see that for a given @xmath200 , @xmath39 is uniquely determined whereas @xmath88 is given by the positive solutions of the following equation : @xmath201 by solving this equation for @xmath88 , the two schwarzschild infilling geometries are found is the radius of the @xmath18 fibre and _ not _ the proper length @xmath202 , though they are related : @xmath203 .",
    "there are in general two positive roots of eq.([eqm ] ) provided @xmath204 .",
    "when the equality holds the two solutions become degenerate and beyond this value of squashing they turn complex . the remaining root of eq.([eqm",
    "] ) is always negative .",
    "therefore the two infilling solutions appear and disappear in pairs as the boundary data is varied .",
    "the explicit solutions are mentioned in @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to see that in arbitrary dimensions for @xmath205 , there will in general be two schwarzschild solutions or no solution .",
    "simply note that the ratio of the two radii as a function of @xmath206 is : @xmath207 for any @xmath4 the general behaviour is the following : @xmath208 starts from zero and grows monotonically to a maximum value and then decreases and approaches zero asymptotically at infinity , as in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the maximal value of the squashing depends on the number of dimensions only and can be found by differentiating eq.([sqshr ] ) .",
    "the condition on the admissible boundary data in @xmath2 dimensions therefore reads : @xmath209 any squashing satisfying the inequality will occur for two values of @xmath210 corresponding to two distinct values of @xmath87 .",
    "if the squashing of a given data @xmath200 exceeds this value , there will be no positive solution for @xmath87 and hence no real infilling schwarzschild solution can be found with positive mass . at the equality of ( [ sqsh ] )",
    ", the two solutions are degenerate as in four dimensions .",
    "for the eguchi - hanson metric ( [ egu ] ) in @xmath102 dimensions , it is fairly straightforward to check that the infilling solutions are unique .",
    "the squashing @xmath211 as a function of @xmath212 , increases monotonically from zero and approaches unity as @xmath213 . for a given boundary data @xmath193",

    "note that this equation is inhomogeneous , first order and linear and its solution is unique for any boundary data @xmath268 .",
    "more importantly , it is _ non - autonomous _ , unlike the einstein equations we started with .",
    "this latter property , though not desirable in most cases , will greatly facilitate our understanding of the boundary - value problem under consideration .",
    "the apparent singular point @xmath269 of eq.([flow ] ) is a regular singular point as one can guess .",
    "we will discuss it further when we deal with the nut - case .",
    "for the purpose of exposition we start with the bolt case .      at a bolt ,",
    "i.e , at @xmath270 ( where @xmath271 ) , @xmath266 is zero trivially as @xmath272 ( @xmath128 is nonzero ) .",
    "( the integral @xmath273-f[-n,-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},{r'_{b}}^{2}]\\ ] ] has a factor @xmath274 for arbitrary @xmath4 , as can be checked by expanding and factoring the ( finite ) hypergeometric series making the squashing zero at the bolt . )",
    "since @xmath266 is zero at @xmath270 , eq.([flow ] ) implies immediately that @xmath275 and hence @xmath266 will grow . it will continue to grow monotonically till it reaches the value where @xmath276  which is an extremum . the second derivative at the extremum ( or at any extremum ) , @xmath277 is negative .",
    "so @xmath266 starts decreasing and we have a `` hump '' .",
    "since the second derivative at any extremum is negative for any @xmath278 irrespective of the initial data , a minimum can never occur and hence @xmath266 will decrease monotonically , i.e. , @xmath279 will always be negative after the maximum .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath266 can never be negative , i.e. , the curve can not cross the @xmath210-axis because that would violate eq.([flow ] ) .",
    "( this physically corresponds to the obvious fact that @xmath116 and @xmath117 are positive . )    as @xmath280 , the only possibility for @xmath266 is therefore to be asymptotic to some constant value . for @xmath210 large eq.([flow ] ) can be approximated by : @xmath281 giving @xmath282 for all @xmath4 and any value of @xmath120 ( which depends on the initial data ) this approaches zero asymptotically , i.e. , @xmath266 is an asymptote to the @xmath210-axis .",
    "therefore for any boundary data @xmath193 for which @xmath283 there will be precisely two infilling taub - bolt metrics .",
    "physically , as @xmath284 , @xmath129 stabilizes to a constant value while @xmath128 continues to grow linearly .",

    "physically @xmath128 and @xmath129 have similar power law behaviour near the nut and hence @xmath266 approaches a constant value .",

    "in fact it is easier to see it in the following way : at @xmath297 , where @xmath298 is an arbitrarily small positive quantity , @xmath296 can not be positive ( implying that @xmath279 can not be positive ) because this would then mean an increase in @xmath266 which is not possible since this would make the left hand side of eq.([flow ] ) negative definite .",

    "the bulk contribution vanishes so only the boundary term contributes .",
    "thus the boundary term plays a vital role in the euclidean approach to quantum gravity as was noted in @xcite .",

    "note that @xmath125 can be positive only for @xmath329 .",

    "for @xmath4 odd , there will be at least one real root which will be negative as the product of all roots , @xmath331 , is negative .",
    "remembering descartes rule of changes of sign ( see , for example , @xcite ) , there will be either two other positive roots ( double roots counted twice ) or no positive roots  meaning all other roots are complex .",
    "for @xmath4 even there can be up to two positive and two negative roots while the rest are complex ; the positivity of @xmath332 in this case excludes the possibility of having one positive root and one negative root .",

    "the problem at hand is to find the @xmath4 solutions of eq.([refeq ] ) and identify the two positive roots which are bound to exist for @xmath125 obeying ( [ psqsh ] ) .",

    "as a special case to the general equation of degree @xmath4 , he showed that the general trinomial equation of degree @xmath4 with arbitrary complex coefficients can be solved exactly in terms of hypergeometric functions of order @xmath4 of _ one _ variable .",
    "we have discussed the general solutions in detail in the appendix . as far as we know",
    ", there is no substantial reference to the general solutions of trinomial equations in the literature available in english .    as in the appendix ,",
    "the general solutions of ( [ trinom ] ) are given in terms of the variable @xmath335 the solutions fall into two separate sectors corresponding to @xmath336 and @xmath337 .",

    "in our case , @xmath338 , @xmath339 , @xmath340 and hence @xmath341 since @xmath342 , @xmath343 is a quadratic function of squashing .    recalling that we are interested only in the _ positive _ roots of eq.([refeq ] ) , which exist only for values of @xmath125 given by ( [ psqsh ] ) , we need not consider @xmath343 corresponding to values exceeding the bound of ( [ psqsh ] ) .",

    "the action is zero for @xmath375 ( by virtue of the above subtraction ) and it increases monotonically to reach a maximum and then decreases monotonically to the minimum value @xmath376 corresponding to @xmath377 .",

    "it is fairly straightforward to work out that this zero occurs for @xmath378 therefore for @xmath379 the action will always be negative . note that the values of @xmath222 within this range is always greater than the value of @xmath222 given by ( [ lesmas ] ) and hence the action will be negative only for the larger mass black hole and for a restricted range , i.e. , if the temperature is sufficiently high enough .",
    "since the free energy is @xmath380 , the larger - mass black hole nucleated spontaneously from hot flat space for any temperature above this will be globally thermodynamically stable . for a given cavity of radius @xmath128 , this temperature can be found using eq.([refeq ] ) : @xmath381      the expressions ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) are exact and can be used for precise calculation using the known properties of the higher order hypergeometric functions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",

    "note that higher dimensional taub - nut metrics all have the same symmetry @xmath404 . with the same substitutions used in four dimensions ,",
    "namely , @xmath405 one can reduce the problem to the study of a univariate equation  a cubic in six dimensions , quartic in eight dimensions , i.e. , an equation of degree @xmath2 in @xmath102 dimensions . the boundary - value problem for taub - nut therefore",
    "can be solved exactly in up to eight dimensions using radicals .",
    "we do not , however , write them here for lack of space .",
    "for dimensions ten and above the relevant equations will be quintic and above , and , as already mentioned , solutions in terms of radicals are not possible in general . as discussed in the previous section",
    ", one can solve the general equation of degree @xmath4 in terms of the higher order hypergeometric functions - hypergeometric functions @xcite . ] .",
    "however , unlike the case of schwarzschild , where we had a trinomial equation , these will be higher order hypergeometric functions of several variables .",
    "although it is possible in principle to work them out explicitly , the solutions would not be illuminating as in the case of schwarzschild solutions and therefore we do not attempt to do it here .",
    "rather it is much easier to treat them numerically .",
    "a numerical treatment is rather straightforward as we can treat everything as a function of squashing only  a simplification resulting from the vanishing of the cosmological constant term .",
    "often the condition of convexity is applied to eliminate degenerate infilling solutions for a given boundary .",
    "for example , an @xmath40 of 3-radius @xmath39 embedded in an @xmath406 of 4-radius greater than @xmath39 divides the @xmath406 into two unequal hemispheres both of which are infilling solutions _ a priori_. however , the smaller hemisphere is the one which is convex , i.e. , the eigenvalues of the second fundamental form @xmath407 are positive ( using the convention that the outward normal @xmath4 is positive ) whereas for the larger hemisphere it is the opposite . discarding the latter leaves us with one unique infilling solution .",
    "it is fairly straightforward to check explicitly that @xmath408 has positive eigenvalues for both of the schwarzschild solutions and for the unique eguchi - hanson solution . for the taub - nut or taub - bolt , the second fundamental form",
    "can easily be computed in the orthonormal frame : @xmath409 where @xmath410 .",
    "since the scale factors , @xmath116 and @xmath117 both increase monotonically ( for any value of @xmath121 ) with @xmath39 , both @xmath411 and @xmath412 are strictly positive .",
    "therefore the unique infilling taub - nut solution and the two taub - bolt infilling solutions are all convex without imposing any further restrictions on the boundary data than those needed for the solutions to exist .",
    "since all the solutions are convex , it follows immediately from a theorem by reilly @xcite that the following inequality holds @xmath413 where @xmath414 and @xmath105 are the volume and the volume element of the boundary @xmath9 and @xmath415 is the volume of the @xmath102-dimensional manifold with the boundary @xmath9 . since the boundaries above are convex for any infillings the right hand side of ( [ reilly ] ) is positive for all infilling solutions above .",
    "note that this term is proportional to the euclidean action ( [ action ] ) with a negative proportionality constant and hence the action is negative for all infillings .",
    "the inequality ( [ reilly ] ) therefore provides a lower bound for the action of any infilling solution .      for a @xmath416-dimensional closed surface @xmath9 in @xmath417 ,",
    "one has the following inequality due to minkowski ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath418 where @xmath414 is the @xmath416-volume of @xmath9 , often referred to as `` area '' , and @xmath415 is the volume of the @xmath417 enclosed by it .",
    "this states that for a closed surface of constant area the greatest volume enclosed is that of a sphere ( for which the equality holds ) . in three dimensions ,",
    "this gives the celebrated formula @xmath419 naturally , one therefore seeks the ricci - flat counterparts to this flat - space inequality .",
    "this is what we do in the following section with our ricci - flat metrics which admit a @xmath0 action .",
    "it is not obvious whether such inequalities would obey the bound ( [ bound ] ) in general or under special conditions .",
    "as we will see , the machinery we developed in the preceding sections for finding uniqueness or non - uniqueness of the infilling solutions has already set the ground for such an investigation .",
    "as before , we deal with four dimensions first before going to higher dimensions . for the sake of convenience",
    "we adopt the terminology of the flat space by denoting the codimension - one volume of @xmath9 as @xmath414 and often refer to it as the `` area '' .",
    "the term volume and @xmath415 will be reserved for the infilling solutions .        for the euclidean schwarzschild metric eq.([sch ] ) the area of the 3-surface @xmath9 at radius @xmath39 is @xmath420 the volume @xmath415 of the euclidean schwarzschild metric bounded by @xmath9 is : @xmath421 the dimensionless ratio is therefore @xmath422 rewriting @xmath423 , as we did in section @xmath21 , we obtain @xmath424 recall that for a given hypersurface @xmath9 , there are in general two euclidean schwarzschild infilling metrics which are given by the two positive solutions for @xmath222 satisfying the following algebraic equation @xmath425 where @xmath426 .",
    "this gives two black hole solutions for a given @xmath200 which determines the area @xmath414 of @xmath9 . as we have shown , for the smaller - mass black hole , which is an instanton , @xmath427 $ ] and for the larger - mass black hole which is thermodynamically / dynamically stable @xmath428 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath429 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath222 in the interval @xmath430 and blows up at @xmath377 .",
    "therefore the isoperimetric inequality for the lower - mass unstable schwarzschild infilling solution is @xmath431 i.e. , @xmath432 for the larger mass , stable infilling solution this is @xmath433 i.e. , @xmath434      for convenience rewrite the euclidean schwarzschild metric in @xmath2 dimensions as @xmath435 this metric is regular provided @xmath69 has a period of @xmath436 .",
    "the area of a constant @xmath39-slice @xmath9 is given by @xmath437 and the volume enclosed by it is @xmath438 giving the ratio @xmath429 which is therefore @xmath439 where @xmath440 as before .",

    "it can easily be seen from ( [ schrat ] ) that @xmath429 increases monotonically for @xmath222 within @xmath430 and blows up at @xmath390 .",
    "therefore the isoperimetric inequalities for the two infilling schwarzschild black holes in @xmath2 dimensions are : @xmath445 for the smaller - mass unstable solution and @xmath446 for the larger mass stable solution .",
    "note that in the convention used here the metric on the @xmath166 dimensional base manifold satisfies the einstein equation with a cosmological constant term of @xmath95 and hence for @xmath447 , with the canonical round metric on it , the volume is that of the `` unit '' @xmath166-dimensional sphere and is equal to @xmath448 . with this choice of base manifold",
    "it is easy to see that minkowski s inequality ( [ bound ] ) is always true for the stable larger - mass schwarzschild solution in any dimension .",
    "however , it does not hold in general for the lower - mass , unstable ( instanton ) solution .        for the taub - nut metric ( [ tn ] )",
    "the area @xmath414 of a constant @xmath39-slice is @xmath449 and the volume enclosed within it is @xmath450 therefore @xmath451 rewriting @xmath452 we obtain @xmath453 this is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath454 .",

    "note that all three spaces are self - dual .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the isoperimetric inequalities in other self - dual spaces in four dimensions which , however , is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "the area of the constant-@xmath39 hypersurface and the volume enclosed by it are respectively @xmath503 and @xmath504 and hence @xmath505 giving the isoperimetric inequality for the eguchi - hanson metric to be @xmath506 for @xmath507 which in this convention has the volume of the unit sphere @xmath133 divided by @xmath79 , the isoperimetric inequality ( [ eguhidim ] ) reads @xmath508 this is just @xmath293 times the @xmath102 dimensional minkowski s inequality ( [ minkh ] ) in flat space .",
    "this is therefore always somewhere in the middle of flat space and taub - nut .",
    "note that this inequality illustrates another fundamental difference between the eguchi - hanson case and the schwarzschild and taub - bolt cases than found in terms of number of infilling solutions . in the latter two cases @xmath266 is zero at the bolt whereas in this case @xmath266 blows up at the bolt .",
    "the lower bound of ( [ eguhidim1 ] ) comes from @xmath509",
    ". this explains ( [ eguhidim1 ] ) immediately via the periodicity of the fibre .",
    "in this paper we studied the dirichlet problem for cohomogeneity one ricci - flat metrics whose principal orbits are @xmath22 bundles over compact einstein spaces .",
    "we then investigated the subsequent isoperimetric inequalities . in the case of trivial bundles",
    "the ricci - flat solutions are the schwarzschild metrics for arbitrary choices of the compact einstein base . in the case of non - trivial bundles",
    "the base spaces are required to be einstein - khler and solutions exist only in even dimensions .",
    "the resulting ricci - flat solutions can be classified using their 4-dimensional analogues : the eguchi - hanson , the taub - nut and the taub - bolts .",
    "all of these metrics can be topologically classified according to the presence and absence of singular orbits , i.e. , bolts or nuts . with the correct periodicity of the @xmath22-fibre , bolts and nuts can be made regular and hence can be included into the complete metric . in the case of taub - nut one further requires the einstein - khler base to be complex projective space .    when the boundary @xmath9 is a non - trivial bundle of dimension three , it is possible to find explicit 4-dimensional taub - nut and taub - bolt solutions exactly by treating the problem as a system of two bivariate equations",
    ". however , these equations become rather complicated as one goes higher in the ladder of dimensionality making a case - by - case study rather difficult and impossible analytically .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by using a general approach involving differential equations and polynomials which together provide a unified way of treating the taub - nut and all taub - bolts ( including those for which @xmath510 ) in arbitrary dimension .",
    "this method also makes their topologically different characters rather distinct .",
    "such an approach is possible because ricci - flatness effectively reduce the problem to the one - variable problem of squashing , i.e. , involving the ratio of the two radii of @xmath9 rather than their separate absolute values .",
    "the taub - nut infilling solution is unique and the taub - bolt infilling solution is double - valued in all dimensions and do not depend on details like the choice of base and the periodicity of the @xmath22 fibre .",
    "the upper limit on the squashing for the boundary @xmath9 to admit a taub - nut infilling is given by a simple function of dimension .",
    "in the case of taub - bolts , however , we are not so lucky .",
    "upper limits on squashing , although a function of dimension only need be worked out for each dimension ( and for each possible values of @xmath124 ) separately which is a straightforward task however . in the case that @xmath9 is a trivial bundle the infilling schwarzschild geometry is double - valued in arbitrary dimension and does not depend on the choice of the base manifold .",
    "the upper limit on the squashing for @xmath9 to admit schwarzschild solutions is a simple function of dimension .",
    "one may therefore guess that the origin of non - uniqueness is geometric and is related to the presence of a singular orbit of the group action , i.e. , a bolt .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "however , the presence of a bolt acts as a necessary condition only .",
    "it is not a sufficient condition as we found that the possible eguchi - hanson infilling geometry in arbitrary dimension is unique despite the presence of a bolt .",
    "it is worth recalling that the eguchi - hanson metric in four dimensions has a self - dual riemann tensor .",
    "hence the set of ordinary differential equations arising from the einstein equations is reduced to a first order set and the various scale factors ( here the two radii of the evolving hypersurface ) fix the values of their derivatives uniquely .",
    "they , however , are required to satisfy the constraint equation .",
    "the einstein equation then guarantees a unique evolution ( whether it is regular or non - regular at the origin is an _ a posteriori _ issue ) .",
    "this is also true for the taub - nut in four dimensions which is self - dual as well . in the presence of a cosmological constant",
    "the taub - nut in four dimensions becomes taub - nut-(anti)de sitter which obviously does not have a self - dual riemann tensor .",
    "however , it has a self - dual weyl tensor which reduces the system to first order and thus the above comments apply .",
    "the condition on the boundary data to have a self - dual taub - nut - ads solution has been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the infilling geometries were found as exact analytic functions of the boundary data despite the presence of a cosmological constant which involves the two radii rather than their squashing . in the case of taub - bolt - ads",
    "the number of solutions can be as high as ten which has been shown in @xcite .    in the case of trivial bundles ,",
    "infilling schwarzschild solutions were obtained by finding the two masses of the black holes as analytic functions of the two radii ( effectively their squashing ) . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first study of this kind of higher dimensional schwarzschild . with the relatively recent work on the negative mode of higher dimensional schwarzschild in a finite cavity @xcite ,",
    "this provides a straightforward generalisation of the results obtained in four dimensions .",
    "since we have obtained the two masses of the black holes as exact , analytic functions of the cavity radius and temperature , our study provides a basis for further exact semi - classical computations of black hole thermodynamics and dynamics as all classical quantities can be evaluated from the geometry exactly as functions of the cavity radius and its temperature .",
    "as one would expect , the introduction of a cosmological constant would also make the problem rather non - trivial .",
    "it is indeed the case .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that in four dimensions there are two infilling schwarzschild - ads solutions in a finite isothermal cavity with positive and negative specific heats .",
    "it remains to see how this picture changes in higher dimensions and whether explicit solutions for infilling geometries are possible .",
    "these will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we show that for all infilling solutions above , including those occurring in pairs , the boundary is necessarily convex .",
    "this answers the question posed by one of the authors at the samos meeting on cosmology , geometry and relativity , 1998 @xcite of whether convexity can be applied as a criteria for selecting solutions if the boundary admits more than one infilling geometry ( of the same type ) .",
    "we show that convexity can not play such a role for ricci - flat spaces admitting @xmath0 actions in general . using a relatively recent theorem by reilly @xcite",
    ", we find that convexity gives a lower bound of the euclidean action for each infilling solution through the @xmath4-volume of @xmath9 and the @xmath2-volume of the infilling solutions @xmath511 .    finally we have discussed the analogues of minkowski s inequality and found some interesting results .",
    "they can be grouped into two classes . in one class",
    "we have the taub - nut and the eguchi - hanson spaces .",
    "we found that the analogue of ( flat - space s ) minkowski s inequality for the taub - nut in arbitrary dimension is just the opposite of minkowski s inequality in that dimension .",
    "the eguchi - hanson is found to lie in the middle in that its inequality has the same _ sense _ as that of flat - space minkowski and is @xmath293 times the latter in @xmath102 dimensions .",
    "we have explained why this happens .",
    "the other class consists of the schwarzschild and the taub - bolt . in either case ,",
    "the two infilling geometries , although topologically equivalent , are strikingly dissimilar in their isoperimetric inequalities .",
    "we have been able to find the inequalities explicitly in the case of the schwarzschild solutions .",
    "the two inequalities are `` connected '' in that one is given by being equal or greater than some value and the other by the opposite of this inequality .",
    "interestingly the isoperimetric inequality for the larger mass stable black hole solution which has a positive specific heat is always within minkowski s bound . in gravitational thermodynamics hot flat space is taken as the background for the schwarzschild calculations and hence this observation may have some important thermodynamic consequences . for the taub - bolt",
    "the nature of the polynomials involved prohibits one to obtain the inequalities exactly , and also the two inequalities are not `` connected '' .",
    "they both , however , have the same _ sense _ in that they are given by being equal or less than some values .",
    "we have obtained analytic expressions in a form from which it is straightforward to find the approximate inequalities ( for any choice of base manifold @xmath30 and for any value of the periodicity @xmath124 ) numerically should one need to know them .",
    "note that both of the inequalities obey the bound provided by their nut counterpart , i.e. , by the taub - nut .",
    "therefore the above comments about the flat space and the schwarzschild equally apply for the taub - nut and taub - bolt solutions .",

    "<S> we show that in the case of non - trivial bundles taub - bolt infillings are double - valued whereas taub - nut and eguchi - hanson infillings are unique . in the case of trivial bundles , there are two schwarzschild infillings in arbitrary dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the condition of whether a particular type of filling in is possible can be expressed as a limitation on squashing through a functional dependence on dimension in each case . </S>",
    "<S> the case of the eguchi - hanson metric is solved in arbitrary dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the taub - nut and the taub - bolt are solved in four dimensions and methods for arbitrary dimension are delineated . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of schwarzschild , analytic formulae for the two infilling black hole masses in arbitrary dimension have been obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this should facilitate the study of black hole dynamics / thermodynamics in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we found that all infilling solutions are convex . </S>",
    "<S> thus convexity of the boundary does not guarantee uniqueness of the infilling . </S>",
    "<S> isoperimetric inequalities involving the volume of the boundary and the volume of the infilling solutions are then investigated . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the analogues of minkowski s celebrated inequality in flat space are found and discussed providing insight into the geometric nature of these ricci - flat spaces .    </S>",
