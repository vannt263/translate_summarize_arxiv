    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are low - mass ( @xmath10.5m@xmath2 ) core helium - burning horizontal branch stars with very thin outer hydrogen layers , making them quite hot ; they likely proceed directly to the white dwarf cooling track without reaching the asymptotic giant branch after core helium exhaustion ( heber 1984 ; saffer et al .",
    "1994 ) . in recent years ,",
    "over 30 sdb stars have been identified as multimode pulsators , with typical pulsation periods of 100250s and amplitudes generally less than a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "officially designated v361 hya stars , they are also commonly known as ec  14026 stars after the prototype ( ec  14026 - 2647 ) and referred to as sdbv stars following the pulsating white dwarf convention ( dov , dbv , dav ) .",
    "recent reviews of pulsating sdb stars have been given by charpinet , fontaine & brassard ( 2001 ; pulsation theory ) and kilkenny ( 2002 ; observation ) .",
    "asteroseismology has successfully been applied to some other classes of variable stars in order to discern their interior conditions ( winget et al .",
    "1991 ; kanaan et al . 2005 ; mukadam et al . 2003 ; among others ) and in time , it is hoped the same can be accomplished for sdb stars .",
    "to do so , the pulsation frequencies ( periods ) must first be resolved .",
    "variable star discovery surveys seldom resolve or detect the complete set of pulsations .",
    "multisite campaigns , because of the complexity of organization , have only observed a few sdb pulsators . our program is to resolve poorly - studied sdb pulsators from single - site data , supplemented with a small amount of multi - site data .",
    "this method has proven useful for the sdbv star feige 48 ( reed et al .",
    "2004 ) . by combining limited ( 510 days ) amounts of data from larger telescopes with a longer timebase ( some 20 + days ) of data from smaller ( 0.41.0 m ) telescopes , it is possible to effectively resolve the pulsation spectrum of an sdbv star .",
    "our high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) data from larger telescopes can detect pulsation amplitudes as low as 0.2 milli - modulation amplitudes ( mma , equivalent to 0.02% ) , insuring that we do not miss low amplitude modes and that the resolution of our complete data set is 0.4  @xmath0hz",
    ".    this paper reports the results of our observations on the sdbv star kpd  2109 + 4401 ( hereafter kpd  2109 ) .",
    "kpd  2109 was discovered to be a pulsator nearly simultaneously by koen ( 1998 ; hereafter k98 ) and billres et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , both of whom detected five frequencies .",
    "additional studies of kpd  2109 include a time - series spectroscopic study ( jeffery & pollacco 2000 ) and multicolour observations using ultracam on the wht 4.2-m telescope ( jeffery et al .",
    "however , none of these relatively short duration observations have likely resolved the pulsation structure ( in fact , k98 claim not to have ) , prompting us to choose kpd  2109 for follow - up observations .",
    "data were collected at five observatories during september and october of 2004 with ccd photometers and the specifics of each run are provided in table  [ tab01 ] .",
    "data were obtained at the mcdonald observatory 2.1  m telescope and the mdm observatory 1.3  m telescope using an apogee alta u47 + ccd camera .",
    "this camera is connected via usb2.0 for high - speed readout and our binned ( @xmath3 ) images had an average dead - time of one second .",
    "observations at baker observatory ( 0.4  m ) were obtained with a princeton instruments rs1340 ccd camera .",
    "we used a 601@xmath4601 pixel subframe at @xmath5 binning and our average dead - time was one second .",
    "data from the observatory of the university of athens ( 0.4  m ) were obtained with an sbig st-8 ccd camera with an average dead - time of six seconds .",
    "photometry from mt .",
    "suhora astronomical observatory , poland ( 0.6  m ) were obtained with an sbig st-10 xme ccd camera with an average dead - time of three seconds .",
    "the observations at mdm , mcdonald , and baker observatories used red cut - off filters ( bg38 , bg40 , and bg40 , respectively ) , suhora observatory observations used a johnson b filter , and data from athens used no filter . as pulsations from sdb stars have little dependence in the visual between these various filters , and no phase dependence ( k98 ) , mixing these data is not seen as a problem .",
    "the same is true for timing from the various observatories : ntp was used at athens , mcdonald , baker , and mdm observatories and a gps clock at suhora observatory . both of these issues ( particularly timing )",
    "would also appear as artifacts in our analyses in  3 and 4.3 .",
    "a portion of data from mdm observatory is shown in figure  [ fig01 ] on two different scales .",
    "the top panel has several hours of data , showing the obvious beating that occurs on multiple time scales which indicates the multiperiodic nature of the pulsations .",
    "the bottom panel spans less time to emphasize individual pulsations .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,<,<,^ , > , < \" , ]      another question involving sdbv stars is the mode degree @xmath6 of the pulsations .",
    "in resolved sdbv stars , we sometimes observe many more pulsation modes than @xmath6=0 , 1 , and 2 can provide .",
    "higher @xmath6 modes may be needed , but if so they must have a larger intrinsic amplitude because of the large degree of geometric cancellation ( charpinet et al .",
    "2005 ; reed , brondel , & kawaler 2005 ) . from the lack of multiplet structure",
    "we may assume that all @xmath7 values are degenerate and only concern ourselves with the number of @xmath6 modes available within the observed frequency limits of kpd  2109 .",
    "not attempting to match frequencies , but merely choosing a representative model based on @xmath8 and @xmath9 from spectroscopy ( heber et al .",
    "2000 ) , we can determine if a model can provide the observed mode density using only @xmath6=0 , 1 , and 2 modes .",
    "we searched our model grid of isuevo models ( see reed et al .",
    "2004 ) within the spectroscopic error box of kpd  2109 .",
    "the minimum distance between consecutive orders for the same @xmath6 was @xmath10hz with a median spacing of @xmath11hz for @xmath6=0 , 1 , or 2 .",
    "we also examined a representative model from the published grid by charpinet et al .",
    "( 2002 ; model # 7 with @xmath12  k and @xmath13 ) .",
    "the spacings between their consecutive orders near the appropriate frequency range for kpd  2109 was 892 , 1413 , 575 , and 949  @xmath0hz for @xmath6=0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "as the observed range between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is only @xmath16hz , models can only supply a single frequency per @xmath6 degree . to obtain the number of frequencies observed in kpd  2109 , assuming no rotational splitting , would require @xmath6 values up to 5 .",
    "thus we can add kpd  2109 to the list of sdbv stars with pulsations too dense to be accounted for with only low - degree ( @xmath17 ) modes .",
    "as part of the discovery data , k98 obtained 4 nights ( spread over 6 days and totaling 26.6 hours ) of simultaneous 4-color ( ubvr ) observations of kpd  2109 and in 2002 , three consecutive nights of ultracam data ( totaling 9.7 hours ) were obtained by jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter j04 ) .",
    "we have frequencies @xmath14 - @xmath15 in common with k98 who , using unconstrained and adiabatically constrained phases identifies @xmath6= 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 1 and 1 , 0 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 1 respectively .",
    "we have @xmath14 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath15 in common with j04 who identifies these frequencies as @xmath6= 0 , 2 , 1 , 0 , and 2 .",
    "interestingly , j04 identifies the 5084  @xmath0hz frequency detected in k98 as @xmath6=4 .",
    "however , we again ( and disappointingly ) have to dismiss this frequency as undetectable in the j04 data set .",
    "j04 were unable to simultaneously fit all of their data with their frequency solutions because of the complexity of the data window .",
    "however , for their 3 individual runs , the frequency resolutions are 245 , 153 , and 40  @xmath0hz , respectively ; far too large to distinguish the 5084  @xmath0hz frequency from the much higher amplitude 5093  @xmath0hz one .",
    "the final result is that none of the frequencies have the same @xmath6 value in all three determinations and none of the reliably detected frequencies indicate @xmath6 values larger than 2 , though such values are required to match the frequency density given current models .",
    "based on the extensive data acquired from five observatories , we are able to resolve the pulsation spectrum of the pulsating sdb star kpd  2109 + 4401 . we have analyzed the entire data set as well as several subsets to insure that we have detected real peaks rather than aliases .",
    "we confirmed the five known frequencies",
    "@xmath14  @xmath20 previously identified by both k98 and billres et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but do not detect the 5084  @xmath0hz frequency detected by k98 .",
    "we suspect that as this frequency was the lowest amplitude pulsation detected by k98 , the amplitudes showed some variability in his data , and since it must have been somewhat masked by the window pattern ( see fig .  4 of k98 ) , that it was likely an artifact of his data .",
    "of course another possibility is that the amplitude has since diminished beyond our detection limit .",
    "we resolve a doublet ( @xmath18 and @xmath21 ) also detected by k98 , but at 0.8  @xmath0hz separation , was not readily resolvable in his data .",
    "furthermore , our best data sets detect the feature at 4781  @xmath0hz , which was suspected by k98 and marginally detect another frequency at 4701  @xmath0hz .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] and provided in table  [ tab03 ] , all of our subsets detect the same frequencies without ambiguity , though the doublet is only resolved in groups i and ii .",
    "the detection of the two low - amplitude frequencies ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) relies on the high s / n data from larger telescopes ; here the mdm 1.3-m and the mcdonald 2.1-m telescopes .",
    "we have shown that even though there is residual power in the ft after prewhitening by the six main frequencies , it is almost certainly caused by amplitude variation .",
    "we have examined our frequency content for observational constraints on the pulsation modes with the following results , and detect no signs of evenly spaced frequency multiplets that could be induced by rotation . as such",
    ", we have no way to distinguish between pulsation frequencies of varying @xmath7 values and assume that they are degenerate , or @xmath24 .",
    "current models can not reproduce the observed frequency density without invoking high - degree ( @xmath25 ) modes . however , multicolour photometry constrains all observed frequencies to @xmath17 , though the identifications for individual frequencies disagree between methods and observers .",
    "we examined pulsation amplitudes of the four frequencies that are resolvable on a night - by - night basis over the duration of our run and notice that two frequencies are stable while two vary substantially .",
    "the amount of amplitude variability can be used to test if the pulsations are of a stochastic nature and we determine that two frequencies are definitely not stochastically excited while the two amplitude - variable frequencies could be .",
    "our scientific goal of this observational study was to resolve the pulsation structure of the sdb star kpd  2109 by combining limited amounts of data from larger telescopes with data from smaller ( @xmath10.5  m ) telescopes .",
    "as expected , this combination has allowed us a long timebase sufficient to resolve closely spaced pulsations of the star and the increased s / n of the larger telescopes allow us to detect pulsations with amplitudes as low as 0.3mma .",
    "these data are five times better than k98 in resolution and three times more sensitive in amplitude .",
    "these successful efforts encourage us to carry out detailed follow - up observations for other poorly studied stars of this class .",
