    "the solution of the eliashberg set is a truly complicated matter .",
    "for that reason , the effect of the electron band energy renormalization is usually omitted what results in the reduction of the equation s number by one third .",
    "the approximation given above , in the most cases , does not affect the final results in a significant manner .",
    "this is evidenced by the good agreement between theoretical predictions and the experimental data @xcite .",

    "the issue is clouding by the fact that the calculations conducted till the present day for the one - band eliashberg model were not strict ; the study were based on very simplified form of the eliashberg function @xcite or approximated analytical formulas @xcite .",
    "for this reson , in the presented paper , the most important thermodynamic parameters for @xmath0 superconductor were analyzed exactly in the framework of the one - band eliashberg model .",

    "let us remind that the two - band approach was successfully used by us for description of the thermodynamic properties of the superconducting state inducing in @xmath98 @xcite .",
