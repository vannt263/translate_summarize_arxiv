    "the onfp designation was introduced by walborn ( 1973 ) to describe several peculiar ( `` p '' ) early - type spectra ; the `` n '' is the classical descriptor of broadened absorption lines , generally ascribed to rapid rotation , while `` f '' denotes o - type spectra with he  ii @xmath04686 and n  iii @xmath2463446404642 in selective ( walborn 2001 ) emission .",
    "the defining peculiarity consists of a composite emission + absorption profile at @xmath04686 , which ranges among different objects from a strong absorption line with weak emission wings to a strong , broad emission line with a central absorption reversal .",
    "the class was independently and simultaneously recognized by conti & leep ( 1974 ) , who designated it oef , by implied analogy with the be stars .",
    "it is noteworthy that the two brightest of stars in the sky , @xmath0  cephei ( walborn 1973 , conti & frost 1974 ) and @xmath3  puppis ( conti & niemela 1976 ) , belong to this peculiar class .",
    "contrary to what might be expected from that datum , modern classifications of about 400 galactic o stars have yielded only six additional members ( maz apellniz et al .",
    "thus , they are rare objects .",
    "the known galactic onfp spectra are listed in table  1 with references .",
    "extensive recent studies and surveys of the rich o - type population of the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) have yielded an increasing sample of onfp and related spectra , which provide the motivation and subject of this work .",
    "a larger sample with known distances may provide vital information toward a physical interpretation of the class .",
    "the number of objects available for discussion here is 28 .",
    "however , it should not be inferred that they have a higher incidence in the mcs ; e.g. , evans et al .",

    "comprises 191 o stars among which there are four new onfp spectra .",
    "these objects are included in the present sample .",
    "mihalas & conti ( 1980 ) proposed that the phenomenology of @xmath3  pup might result from corotation of the inner stellar wind enforced by a weak ( 50  gauss ) magnetic field .",
    "from spectrophotometry of the variable h@xmath4 profile , moffat & michaud ( 1981 ) suggested that @xmath3  pup might be a magnetic oblique rotator with a period of about 5  d. however , donati , howarth et al .",
    "( unpublished ) were unable to detect a field on this star to a comparable limit , albeit orientation dependent .",
    "henrichs ( 1991 ) reported correlated @xmath04686 and uv wind - profile variations , possibly periodic , in @xmath0  cephei on very short timescales , and he inferred that non - radial pulsations may be present .",
    "the similarity of the onfp he  ii @xmath04686 profiles to the balmer profiles of be stars might suggest formation in a disk . however , bouret , hillier , & lanz ( 2008 ) have successfully modeled the @xmath04686 and h@xmath4 profiles of @xmath3  pup with a clumped , rotating wind alone .",
    "we shall present available and suggest future observations that may eventually elucidate the origin(s ) of the peculiar onfp spectral morphology .",

    "all of the classifications have been either newly derived or reexamined for consistency in this work .",
    "two salient characteristics of the onfp class are immediately apparent .",
    "first , as in the smaller galactic sample , there is a substantial range in the appearance of the peculiar he  ii @xmath04686 profiles , from strong emission with a small absorption reversal , to a dominant absorption feature with weak emission wings ; and intermediate cases occur as well .",
    "second , there is also a wide range of line broadening , with a predominance of large values , which affects both the absorption and emission lines equally again as in the galactic counterparts .",
    "these properties suggest rapid rotation , in which the region producing the emission lines participates , with the minority smaller values plausibly arising from high inclinations .",
    "the absorption to emission progression in the he  ii @xmath04686 line of normal o - type spectra has been identified as a luminosity criterion ( walborn 1971 , 1973 , 2009 ; walborn & fitzpatrick 1990 ) .",
    "clearly it would be hazardous to apply that inference to the peculiar onfp profiles .",
    "conservatively , only spectra with a strong , dominant emission feature have been given luminosity class i here , while no luminosity class has been assigned otherwise ; cf .",
    "@xmath0  cep vs. bd  @xmath10  2522 in walborn ( 1973 ) .",
    "the physical luminosities of these stars are investigated below by means of the mc distance moduli .",
    "the comparable broadening of the absorption and emission lines , including n  iii @xmath24634 - 4640 - 4642 , is in keeping with the selective nature of the latter ( walborn 2001 ) and the evidence that they are predominantly of photospheric origin .",
    "comments on several of the individual spectra and related information follow . in several cases",
    ", they are relevant to subsequent discussion of possible origins of the peculiar profiles and their temporal variations .",
    "aa@xmath5  30dor  333 : it is possible that this very early spectrum does not belong in the onfp category , but rather @xmath04686 has a `` composite '' p  cygni profile ( with weaker emission blueward of the absorption component ) that is characteristic of these extreme spectral types ( walborn et al .",
    "however , it is included here for completeness , since it satisfies the formal onfp definition , and there could be a physical relationship .",
    "this star is 531 of testor & niemela ( 1998 ) in the h  ii region n158 south of 30  doradus , also discussed by massey et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and walborn et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",

    "( 2000 ) , which led to the spectral - type range given there , is much weaker if present at all in the uves data shown here .",
    "further observations are required to determine whether a real spectral variation is involved .",
    "walborn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also showed the ultraviolet spectrum of this star ; it has strong wind features as expected for its spectral type .",
    "rapid rotation is not expected in evolved , massive stars with strong winds , which should be braked , as further discussed below .",
    "a quantitative analysis of this spectrum was performed by heap , lanz , & hubeny ( 2006 ) .",
    "parker  841 : this star is in the 30  doradus core cluster ( walborn & blades 1997 ) , which may indicate a very young object , unlike the majority of the onfp class .",
    "st  232 and st  253 : these two very similar spectra correspond to objects within 30  doradus  c ( schild & testor 1992 ) ; the latter is one of the brightest stars in the region and is in a subclustering .",
    "2dfl  5250 : the @xmath04686 emission is single peaked , so this is not an onfp spectrum .",
    "however , both absorption and emission lines of this apparent supergiant are unusually broadened , and as will be seen below , some onfp objects with multiple observations intermittently remove themselves from the class , so this may well be a related object .",
    "aa@xmath5  30dor  320 : this star is 582 of testor & niemela ( 1998 ) .",
    "hde  269702 : this highly unusual supergiant spectrum has narrow lines and is one of only two in the sample without the `` n '' qualifier in its type ; it also has the lowest value of @xmath11 measured here ( as described below ) .",
    "the very narrow , double @xmath04686 emission is unique to date , but again , the correlation between absorption- and emission - line widths is typical of the onfp class .",
    "note that this observation is from uves , and that this profile would likely not be detected in low - resolution data .",
    "faria  35 : this is the x - ray binary lmc  x-1 ( references in faria et al .",
    "2009 ) , so it is likely that the composite @xmath04686 profile arises at least partly from systemic phenomena and not solely from the o - star extended atmosphere .",
    "nevertheless , it is retained in the present sample because it was selected from the survey data without knowledge of its identity .",
    "it is the other relatively narrow - lined spectrum in this sample . as shown by van der meer et al .",
    "( 2007their online figure  2 ) , double - peaked @xmath04686 profiles are common at certain phases in x - ray binaries , including smc  x-1 and lmc  x-4 .",
    "evans et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported both double- and single - peaked @xmath04686 profiles in different observations of smc  x-1 ; see also lennon ( 1997 ) .",
    "av  321 : another unusual high - luminosity , very broad - lined spectrum .",
    "there is no `` f '' parameter in the spectral type because such is not used later than o8.5 .",
    "the weak emission wings at @xmath04686 may appear difficult to discern at the scale displayed here , but they are striking in the original high - resolution , high - s / n uves data .",
    "again , this profile would likely not be detected in low - resolution data .",
    "absolute visual magnitudes of the sample stars have been calculated from the photometry , with the assumptions of distance moduli of 18.6 for the lmc and 19.1 for the smc , a value of @xmath12 for the ratio of total to selective extinction , and intrinsic colors of the spectral types as listed by walborn et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "the results are given in table  2 and plotted in figure  4 together with the luminosity - class calibration of walborn ( 1973 ) , updated for the o2o3 stars by walborn et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "as shown by the latter and references cited therein , the o spectral types are insensitive to metallicity since they depend upon the he ionization ratio , and there is no evidence for systematic differences among the visual absolute - magnitude calibrations of the galactic and mc o spectral types , within the random uncertainties further discussed below .",
    "it is immediately apparent that there is no absolute - magnitude distinction between the objects assigned luminosity class i and the others in this onfp sample .",
    "indeed , the isolation of peculiar objects is a prerequisite for the recognition of trends and correlations among normal spectra",
    ".    of course , objects that appear `` too bright '' may be unresolved multiple systems , particularly at the distance of the mcs ( e.g. , walborn et al .",
    "inversely , for an assumed distance , the adoption of @xmath13 will yield an absolute magnitude that is too faint if the actual ratio is larger , which it may well be in and around h  ii regions as is the case for the most discrepant class i objects n11 - 20 , st  1 - 28 , and st  1 - 93 .",
    "these issues can be investigated in the future with improved angular resolution or temporal monitoring , and more extensive photometric data and reddening analyses , respectively . however , for the present the most straightforward interpretation of figure  4 is that the onfp phenomenon occurs at all luminosities .",
    "although the resolution of many of the spectrograms is too low to attempt a secure measurement of the rotational broadening @xmath14 , we can make reasonably accurate determinations of the line - broadening parameter @xmath11 , in all but six cases for which the resolution and/or s / n are inadequate for even the latter .",
    "although processes other than rotation may contribute to the line broadening ( e.g. , macroturbulence ) , we expect rotation to be the dominant contributor for the sample of mainly broad - lined stars considered here .    to estimate @xmath11 values , the ostar2002 model grid ( lanz & hubeny 2003 ) was numerically spun up at 10  km  sec@xmath8 steps , with a standard rotational convolution ( e.g. , gray 1992 ) . a gray - atmosphere , linear limb - darkening coefficient of 0.6 was used ; but comparison with full surface integrations , accounting for the detailed wavelength dependence of the non - linear limb darkening across the line profile ( similarly to howarth & smith 2001 ) , shows no important differences from these results .",
    "models with lmc abundances were used ( galactic models gave insignificant differences , and smc models none ) . for each observed spectrum , the rotationally broadened grids",
    "were then further convolved with a gaussian matching the instrumental resolution , and the best - fit model ( in @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath14 ) identified as that giving the minimum r.m.s .",
    "residual over a fixed wavelength range .",
    "final results for @xmath11 , included in table  2 , were determined using the 42504600    range , in order to give the temperature - sensitive he lines more leverage with respect to the balmer lines . in practice ,",
    "the measurements are reasonably insensitive to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but there is a systematic tendency for the best fits to occur at the lowest model gravities for a given @xmath15 .",
    "the generally large @xmath11 results are not an artifact of data quality , as some of the largest values are derived from the high - resolution uves data , and lower values are found among the low - resolution spectra .",
    "comparison of our @xmath11 values with those determined by penny & gies ( 2009 ) from _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "data for six stars in common shows reasonable agreement , with a negligible systematic offset and a median absolute difference of 30  km  sec@xmath8 ; this number is likely a reasonable upper limit to the uncertainties in our measurements .",
    "figure  5 compares the cumulative distribution function of @xmath11 for the mc onfp sample ( plus the `` slow '' rotator hde  269702 ) with those for galactic dwarfs and supergiants of spectral types o8 and earlier , that have determinations by howarth et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from _ international ultraviolet explorer _ data and empirical templates .",
    "the onfp sample differs from both of the latter with @xmath199.99% confidence according to a kolmogorov - smirnov test , that is , it is comprised of broader - lined spectra . again , we note that the onfp class is defined by the he  ii @xmath04686 profiles , while the line broadening is an independent variable .",
    "penny & gies ( 2009 ) have found that rotational velocity distributions are very similar between unevolved and evolved stars in the galaxy , the lmc , and the smc , as well as among the unevolved stars of the three galaxies . on the other hand , they find evidence that macroturbulent broadening in the evolved stars is _ lower _ in the lmc and smc samples than in the galaxy .",
    "thus , the large offset between the mc onfp and the galactic spectra in figure  5 is highly significant .",
    "two observations each of n1120 and sk  @xmath7  111 are shown in figures  6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "the n1120 eso / vlt / flames data are from the work of evans et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and were obtained on two consecutive nights .",
    "they display a significant change in the profile of he  ii @xmath04686 . from further radial - velocity and profile variations in these data ,",
    "evans et al .  concluded that n1120 is a binary .",
    "the change in the @xmath04686 profile of sk  @xmath7  111 between two observations nine months apart is even more dramatic . while the previously unpublished australian national university ( anu ) 2.3  m data have lower resolution and s / n in the continuum",
    ", there is no doubt that the strong @xmath04686 emission line is single peaked , i.e. , this is not an onfp spectrum !",
    "prior evidence of variability in this spectrum is discussed by walborn et al .",
    "( 2002a ) ; the anu 2.3  m data parameters are given by crowther et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    the ctio / argus observations of moffat et al .",
    "( unpublished ) provided extensive temporal coverage specifically to search for spectroscopic binaries .",
    "nightly means from five consecutive nights of st  128 and st  193 are displayed in figure  8 .",
    "large night - to - night variations in the @xmath04686 profiles are seen , again with non - onfp single emission peaks on some nights .",
    "analysis of these data by g.  skalkowski ( unpublished ) has revealed that st  128 is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 2.35  d and a velocity full amplitude of 200  km  sec@xmath8 , while st  193 also displays large radial - velocity variations of undetermined period .",
    "these scattered results strongly suggest that systematic monitoring of onfp spectra is required to understand their nature . in every case with more than one observation ,",
    "significant variations are found .",
    "an initial program on several of these objects was conducted by n.r.w .  and",
    "a.  ahumada during october 2008 and results will be presented in a subsequent publication .      of course ,",
    "all of the onfp spectra correspond to young fields , but most of them are found at the peripheries of clusters and associations , or are even not obviously associated at all . as noted in section 3.1 , only three of them are in bright h  ii regions or tight clusters ( aa@xmath5  30dor  333 , brey  732a , parker  841 ) and two more are in looser subclusterings ( st  128 , st  253 ) .",
    "interestingly , all five of these are among the earliest spectral types in the sample ( figure  1 ) .",
    "that is , the locations of the onfp class appear analogous to those of normal evolving stars of similar spectral types , and they are not extremely young objects .",
    "these results have implications for their origins and nature .",
    "alternatively , it could be relevant in this context that both @xmath3  pup and @xmath0  cep have been determined to be runaways ( mason et al .",
    "1998 ; hoogerwerf , de bruijne , & de zeeuw 2001 ; and references therein ) .",
    "if that were a common property among the onfp class , it would be related to their observed spatial distribution in the mcs .",
    "binary mass transfer , spinup of the mass gainer , supernova kicks , and gamma - ray bursts have all been associated with runaways in some models ; thus , all of these topics could be interrelated in the onfp class as further discussed below .",
    "as a prologue to the discussion , it may be useful to re - emphasize that `` onfp '' is a description of a ( peculiar ) spectral morphology , namely reversed he  ii @xmath04686 emission profiles . in most but not all cases , the latter feature is correlated with line broading indicative of rapid rotation . in view of this definition , the observed spectral variations that at least in some cases temporarily remove objects from the category , and",
    "the _ a priori _ possibility that different physical situations may give rise to this general type of @xmath04686 profile , the term `` onfp stars '' should be avoided , to prevent any misconception that the spectroscopic category corresponds to a unique , identified physical phenomenon",
    ". there may be a predominant mechanism giving rise to the majority of the class , but it remains to be determined whether or not that is true .      in a double - lined o - type spectroscopic binary ,",
    "it is in principle possible for ( variable ) he  ii @xmath04686 profiles such as those in at least some onfp spectra to result from two emission features , or an emission line from one star and an absorption line from the other , shifting relative to each other throughout the orbit .",
    "in addition , there could be variable emission features arising from mass transfer and/or colliding winds in the system .",
    "as reported here , st  128 is a spectroscopic binary , and the galactic onfp star hd  152248 is a well - studied , double - lined spectroscopic binary ( sana , rauw , & gosset 2001 ; mayer et al .",
    "in particular , sana et al",
    ".  showed that in hd  152248 , both stellar @xmath04686 features are absorption lines and the emission most likely arises from the colliding winds .",
    "however , its onfp classification has been retained here because it was derived from a single , low - resolution observation ( walborn 1972 ) , as is the case for many of the present mc sample , so the latter may contain some analogous objects . as also mentioned above ,",
    "faria  35 is an x - ray binary , while st  193 and n1120 are suspected spectroscopic binaries .    nevertheless , the general appearance of most onfp spectra , including several observed at very high resolution , with their comparable broadenings of both absorption and emission lines , is not that of double - lined spectroscopic binaries . of course , only one observation is available for most of them , and clearly this issue can be resolved only by spectroscopic ( and photometric ) monitoring .",
    "it is possible that multiple mechanisms will apply to some different members of the onfp class , but it appears likely that a dominant one is relevant to the majority .",
    "characteristically , most of the onfp class have broadened absorption and emission lines , as shown in the figures and investigated in some detail in section 3.3 .",
    "while detailed profile fitting at high resolution and s / n will be required to establish it , nevertheless rotation is strongly suggested as the line broadening mechanism .",
    "the range of @xmath11 values found could be intrinsic or caused by inclination effects ; the predominance of abnormally large values suggests the latter .",
    "the defining onfp he  ii @xmath04686 profiles are reminiscent of the balmer profiles of be stars , which naturally suggested the possibility of ( hotter ) disks in the former .",
    "evidence for line polarization effects in three galactic onfp spectra has been found by harries , howarth , & evans ( 2002 ) and vink et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , but the interpretation is complex and any implications for the presence of disks are uncertain ; in fact , one of these cases is the binary hd  152248 .",
    "moreover , bouret et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have reproduced variable , double - peaked emission profiles in one of these stars , @xmath3  pup , with a rotating , clumped wind and no disk .",
    "the persistence of rapid rotation in an evolved o - type star with a strong wind presents a problem , since the wind should brake the rotation , as discussed by , e.g. , ekstrm et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in addressing the greater relative frequency of rapid rotators and the be phenomenon among the b stars",
    ". rapid rotation at a late age may be induced by mass transfer ( langer et al .",
    "2008 ) and/or a merger in a binary system , in which orbital angular momentum is converted to rotation ( e.g. , dale & davies 2006 ) ; such an object may also be a candidate gamma - ray burst progenitor , as they discuss . in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting that brey  732a lies about 2 mag above the apparent main - sequence turnoff in its compact cluster ( walborn et al .",
    "1999 ) ; it could be a blue straggler resulting from a binary merger .",
    "of course , this is a single case , and it could also be simply a result of unresolved multiplicity , although st  253 may be a similar case . the possibility of binary mass transfer and stellar mergers warrants consideration in further analysis of the onfp phenomenon",
    "we have investigated a sample of 28 onfp ( and related ) spectra in the magellanic clouds , defined primarily by composite , non - p - cygni emission plus absorption profiles in the key he  ii @xmath04686 line .",
    "their diverse spectral morphology , absolute magnitudes , line broadening , spectral variations , and spatial distribution have been surveyed .",
    "the salient results in each area are as follows .",
    "there is a range of @xmath04686 profile shapes , but the broadening of emission and absorption lines is uniformly correlated .",
    "there is no relationship between the emission - line strengths and the absolute magnitudes in these peculiar objects , as is the case for normal stars .",
    "large , likely rotational line broadening predominates , although a few narrow - lined objects are found ; cumulative line - broadening distributions show definitively that the onfp spectra are drawn from a different parent population than normal spectra .",
    "all objects with multiple observations display significant spectral variations , which can even remove some spectra from the onfp class , i.e. , the @xmath04686 emission becomes single peaked , temporarily .",
    "only a few of these objects are located in compact clusters ; most lie in the peripheries of associations or even in the ( young ) field .",
    "some of the onfp objects are spectroscopic binaries , including at least one x - ray binary , which may be the cause of the peculiar and variable @xmath04686 profiles in those cases ; the current data are inadequate to determine binarity or otherwise for most of them .",
    "the most likely hypothesis for the line broadening is rotational , but there is currently no compelling evidence for disks ( as in be stars ) as the predominant source of these @xmath04686 profiles ; in one galactic case it has been reproduced by a rotating , clumped wind model .",
    "mass - transfer binaries or stellar mergers are possible origins of these evolved rapid rotators with strong winds , and they merit consideration as gamma - ray burst progenitors .",
    "these results suggest several observational and analytical developments that will contribute to understanding the nature of the onfp class . clearly , intensive spectral and photometric monitoring , including radial - velocity measurements , are essential to determine the nature of the endemic variability seen in the limited available coverage .",
    "high spectral resolution and s / n will be preferable . high spatial - resolution images to search for multiplicity , and more extensive photometric and reddening analyses , will improve the accuracy of the absolute magnitudes ( although a gap between spatially and kinematically determined multiplicities in the magellanic clouds will remain for the immediate future ) .",
    "quantitative spectral analyses of high - quality data will establish ( or otherwise ) the rotational interpretation of the line broadening and derive chemical abundances ( especially of cno ) and other parameters essential for a definitive physical model ( or models ) of the onfp spectral category .",
