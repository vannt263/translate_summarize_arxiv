    "solid state nanodevices are at the forefront of present research towards the implementation of quantum networks for quantum computation and communication .",
    "the impressive development in device design and control tools achieved in recent years has by now to face intrinsic limitations due to material imperfections and fluctuations .",
    "the resulting noise presents a variety of material and device dependent features , ranging from noise spectra showing narrow resonances at selected frequencies ( sometimes resonant with the nanodevice relevant energy scales ) to low - frequency high - amplitude noise , often displaying 1/f behavior .",
    "modelling these fluctuations has naturally lead to overtake the ubiquitous effective bath description via harmonic models and/or the hypothesis of linear coupling to the device under investigation .",
    "a typical example are background charge fluctuations which are known since more than 10 years to strongly affect the performance of single - electron tunneling ( set ) circuits  @xcite . nowadays they represent the main limitation for any nanocircuit gate requiring highly reliable electrostatic control .",
    "this is clearly the case of charge  @xcite and charge - phase  @xcite superconducting qubits , but also of semiconducting spin qubits elecrostatically coupled to form a two - qubit gate  @xcite .",
    "the general belief is that background charge noise is due to the activity of random traps for single electrons in dielectric materials surrounding the island of set devices or of superconducting nanocircuits .",
    "these traps may have different trapping energies and switching times , @xmath0 .",
    "an ensemble of non interacting traps with a uniform distribution of trapping energies and a @xmath1 distribution of switching rates may originate the frequently observed 1/f noise  @xcite .",
    "such a spectrum is indicative of numerous traps participating in the generation of the noise . on the other hand ,",
    "some samples clearly produce a telegraph noise with random switching between a few states ( with a magnitude of up to @xmath2 in set devices )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent observations on superconducting qubits in different setups , have suggested the possibility that a few impurities may entangle with the device  @xcite .",
    "such a variety of experimental facts may be consistently predicted by describing background charges as two - state systems whose dynamical behavior may turn from quantum mechanical to classical with increasing temperature and/or with increasing the strength of their dissipative interaction with the fluctuations of the surrounding local host  @xcite .",
    "such a modellization clearly departs from the `` conventional '' bosonic bath model and nicely predicts the different protocol - dependent decay laws of the coherent dynamics observed in charge and charge - phase qubits  @xcite .",
    "multiple frequencies in the qubit dynamics and dependence on the uncontrollable impurities initial state at the beginning of measurement protocol are typical manifestation of non - gaussian character of background charge fluctuations  @xcite .    in order to limit the effect on single qubit gates of these material - specific fluctuations different strategies have been developed . amongst",
    "the most successful is the design of nanocircuits operating at `` protected working points '' insensitive to charge fluctuations to lowest order in the noise strength  @xcite . open- and closed - loop control protocols partly mutated from quantum optics and nmr  @xcite , represent another promising route  @xcite .    presently , the effort of the scientific community working with josephson qubits is to appropriately extend the above strategies to multiqubit architectures , the first step being to implement an efficient two - qubit gate .",
    "different schemes to couple superconducting qubits have been proposed  @xcite and some experiments pointed out the possibility to realize the desired entangled dynamics  @xcite . however , achievement of the needed high fidelity is still an ambitious task .",
    "in addition to fluctuations experienced individually by each single qubit gate , coupled qubits , being usually built on - chip , may suffer from correlated noise due to sources acting simultaneously on both sub - units .",
    "the effects on two - qubit gates of uncorrelated and correlated bosonic baths has been investigated  @xcite .    as far as the effect of background charges , opinions about the probable location of traps are divided and observations depend to a certain extent on the specific sample and on the junction geometry .",
    "however , there is unambiguous evidence that fluctuating traps located in the insulating substrate contribute essentially to the total noise in set devices  @xcite .",
    "these traps are expected to induce similar fluctuations on the two islands built on the same substrate . on the other hand fluctuating traps concentrated inside the oxide layer of the tunnel junctions , due to screening by the junction electrodes , are expected to act independently on the two qubits  @xcite .",
    "impurities acting simultaneously on coupled qubits represent a further unconventional noise source which solid state nanodevices has to face  @xcite .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "specifically , we will introduce a model for correlated charge noise on interacting charge - phase qubits in a fixed capacitive coupling scheme . relying on measurements on set circuits of power spectra on the two transistors and of the cross - spectrum power density ,",
    "we suppose a 1/f behavior for both the two channels spectra and the cross - spectrum  @xcite .",
    "in addition the cross - talk between the two qubits due to the capacitive coupling itself between the islands will be discussed .",
    "our analysis is based on analytical results obtained within the adiabatic approximation for the 1/f noise and on the numerical solution of the stochastic schrdinger equation .",
    "solving the dynamics from short - to - intermediate time scales allows complete understanding of the effects of correlations .",
    "our work extends the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite which , being limited to the long - times behavior , misses relevant features occurring in the short time domain .",
    "we find that usually correlations induce a faster decay of the coherent dynamics compared to the action of independent fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , under realistic values of low - frequency noise amplitude , increasing the degree of correlation may instead lead to longer decoherence times .",
    "finally , the possibility to reduce the effects of low - frequency correlated noise via open - loop recalibration protocols is discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the setup consisting in two cooper pair boxes coupled by a capacitor .",
    "the cross - talk effect and the charge noise sources responsible for correlations will be described and their correlation factor defined . in section 3",
    "we present a possible model for correlated noise exhibiting 1/f power spectrum and cross - spectrum . in section 4 relevant dynamical quantities for a two - qubit gate",
    "are introduced and analytic / numerical methods are illustrated .",
    "section 5 includes our results for the entangled qubits dynamics in the presence of correlations .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
