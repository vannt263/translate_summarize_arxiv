    "the falicov - kimball model is a widely used model to study the properties of interacting fermions@xcite and has also been used to describe the valence change transition in ybincu@xmath3 and similar compounds@xcite .",
    "( for a recent review see ref .   ) .",
    "the model considers a lattice of localized @xmath4-sites , which are either empty or singly - occupied site , and of conduction electron sites , which are delocalized by the nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "there are @xmath5 @xmath4-electrons and @xmath6 conduction electrons interacting by an on - site coulomb interaction @xmath2 .",
    "the two types of electrons share the common chemical potential @xmath7 , which is always adjusted so as to keep @xmath8 .",
    "the local @xmath4-charge is a constant of motion but thermal fluctuations can change the average @xmath4-occupation by transferring electrons or holes from the conduction band to @xmath4-states .",
    "the relative occupation of @xmath4-states and conduction states is determined by the competition between the entropy of the @xmath4- and the conduction states , the excitation energy of the f - states , the kinetic energy of band states , and the interaction energy .",
    "the general solution of the falicov - kimball model is not known except in infinite dimension @xcite . in low dimensions ,",
    "the zero - temperature phase diagram is highly non - trivial and has attracted a lot of theoretical attention ( see ( ) for the list of references ) . in one dimension",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the model are more or less understood , whereas dynamical properties have been much less studied .",
    "kennedy and lieb @xcite proved that at low enough temperatures the half - filled falicov - kimball model for dimensions @xmath9 possesses long - range order , i.e. , the ions form a checkerboard pattern , the same as in the ground state . in the ordered phase , the lattice can be divided into two inter - penetrating sublattices a and b in such a way that all nearest neighbors of a site from sublattice a belong to sublattice b and _ vice versa_. this result holds for any value of the coulomb interaction @xmath2 .",
    "for one dimension longe range order exists only at temperature @xmath10 .    in what follows ,",
    "we first describe the hamiltonian and the projector - based renormalization method ( prm ) which was recently introduced ( sect .",
    "i ) . in sect .",
    "ii the method is then applied to the one - dimensional falicov - kimball model and renormalization equations are derived for the parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "the results for static and dynamic quantities are discussed in sect .",
    "iii and iv .    to simplify the calculation ,",
    "we consider only the case with translation symmetry .",
    "this excludes the discussion of physical properties which depend on lattice sites @xmath11 , i.e. we do not discuss the ordered phase which emerges at low temperatures .",
    "however , as discussed in sect .",
    "v , we can still evaluate physical quantities which are given by averages over all lattice sites .",
    "note that the prm approach can also be extended to situations with long range order .",
    "this was shown for instance in ref .",
    "( ) , where the quantum phase transition for the spinless holstein model was discussed as function of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the spinless falicov - kimball model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the creation and annihilation operators for conduction electrons at site @xmath11 , @xmath15 are the hopping matrix elements , @xmath16 is the energy level of the localized electrons , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the occupation number operators of the localized and conduction electrons at site @xmath11 .",
    "the summation runs over the @xmath19 sites of a periodic lattice , and @xmath2 is the interaction strength of the local coulomb repulsion at sites @xmath11 between conduction and localized electrons .",
    "note that @xmath20 at each site @xmath11 commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the @xmath4-electron occupation number is a good quantum number , taking only two values 1 or 0 , according to whether or not site @xmath11 is occupied by the localized @xmath4-electron .",
    "let us first discuss a recently introduced many - particle method , the projector - based renormalization method ( prm ) @xcite , which provides an approximate solution to many - particle problems defined by the hamiltonian @xmath21 , @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the unperturbed part with a known eigenvalue spectrum , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the perturbation which does not commute with @xmath23 and has off - diagonal matrix elements , @xmath26 , but no diagonal elements . in a usual perturbative approach one evaluates the corrections to the eigenstates and eigenvalues of @xmath23 due to @xmath27 .",
    "the n - th order correction requires the evaluation of all matrix elements up to @xmath28 , which are difficult to calculate .",
    "an alternative insight is obtained by making a unitary transformation to a new basis which has no transition matrix elements with energy differences larger than some chosen cutoff @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the largest energy difference between any two eigenstates of @xmath31 which are connected by @xmath32 .",
    "this generates a new hamiltonian @xmath33 which can be written as a sum of two terms , @xmath34 such that @xmath35 for @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the new eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is chosen in such a way that it has no diagonal elements with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "the generator of the unitary transformation is denoted by @xmath41 which has to be anti - hermitian @xmath42 .",
    "note that the elimination of high energy transitions may also generate new interaction terms which have operator structures different from that of @xmath32 .",
    "however , they do not connect states with an energy separation larger than @xmath43 .    in the prm method the elimination of transition matrix elements",
    "is carried out by defining a generalized projection operator @xmath44 which removes from any operator @xmath45 those parts which give rise to forbidden transitions , i.e. , @xmath46 i.e.  we retain in only the states @xmath47 and @xmath38 with @xmath48 .",
    "the orthogonal complement of @xmath44 is @xmath49 . here",
    "only dyads @xmath50 contribute with @xmath51 .",
    "the generator @xmath52 in is determined by the condition @xmath53 as can be seen by expanding the exponentials in .",
    "this gives @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a superoperator defined by @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath57 $ ] , etc .",
    "in lowest order , @xmath58 reduces to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 $ ] defines the unperturbed liouville operator @xmath61 , which commutes with @xmath62 .",
    "obviously , the condition @xmath63 is satisfied by the expression @xmath64 , i.e. ,  to lowest order , @xmath65 can be obtained from the decomposition of @xmath32 into the eigenmodes of @xmath61 .",
    "the higher order correction terms to @xmath66 follow systematically from the higher order commutators of ( for details see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "we see from eq .   that all transitions in @xmath32 with energy transfers between the original cutoff @xmath30 and the new cutoff @xmath43 are eliminated in one step .",
    "however it is more convenient to perform the elimination procedure step - wise , such that each step reduces the cutoff energy @xmath43 by a small amount @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the first step removes all the transitions which involve energy transfers between ( the original cutoff ) @xmath30 and @xmath68 , the subsequent steps remove all transitions larger than @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and so on . the unitary transformation for the step from an intermediate cutoff @xmath43 to the new cutoff @xmath71 reads ( in analogy to ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74.the generator @xmath75 is now fixed by the condition @xmath76 which specifies that @xmath77 contains no matrix elements which connect eigenstates of @xmath78 with energy differences larger than @xmath71 .",
    "let us assume that the operator structure of @xmath79 is invariant with respect to further unitary transformations .",
    "then , we can use eq .   to derive difference equations for the @xmath43-dependence of the coupling constants of the hamiltonian .",
    "these equations connect the parameters of the hamiltonian with cutoff @xmath43 to those with cutoff @xmath71 . by using a finite number of steps we can proceed to @xmath80 and obtain a set of nonlinear equations for the renormalized parameters .",
    "the solution determines the final , fully renormalized hamiltonian @xmath81 , which depends on the initial parameter values of the original model at cutoff @xmath30 . in this limit",
    "all transitions due to the interaction with nonzero transition energies have been eliminated so that @xmath82 identically vanishes , i.e.  @xmath83 .",
    "the underlying idea of the prm , namely the elimination of the interaction terms by the unitary transformations , has been used before in the literature .",
    "for instance , in ref . a unitary transformation has been employed to eliminate off - diagonal matrix elements of the coulomb interaction in order to study ground state properties of the hubbard model .",
    "similarly , in the schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite , which maps the anderson to the kondo model , matrix elements connecting different charge configurations of magnetic ions are eliminated also by use of a unitary transformation .",
    "note however that in the prm approach unitary transformations are performed in small steps in contrast to earlier applications .",
    "note also that the approach removes high energy transitions but does not decimate the hilbert space .",
    "this is different to the poor man s",
    "scaling@xcite which removes high energy states .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the prm resembles the previous flow equation method @xcite by wegner and the similarity renormalization approach@xcite by glazek and wilson which can be considered as continuous versions of the prm method .",
    "in order to apply the prm we express the falicov - kimball interaction in terms of the fluctuations with respect to the thermal averages of @xmath84 and @xmath20 , and write the diagonal and off - diagonal part of @xmath85 as @xmath86 and @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 denotes the thermal averaging with the full hamiltonian @xmath85 , and @xmath91 is the fourier transform of @xmath13 .",
    "of course , due to the assumed translation invariance @xmath92 is equivalent to @xmath93 , where @xmath19 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the sum in is restricted to @xmath94 , since the diagonal part of the coulomb repulsion is included in @xmath31 . from translation invariance it follows @xmath95 . in principle",
    ", the average values in can be defined with an arbitrary ensemble since eq .   and eqs .  , are equivalent .",
    "it has turned out that the best choice is to evaluate the averages with respect to the original full hamiltonian @xmath96 , which can be done by the procedure explained below .",
    "the perturbation @xmath32 causes transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath31 by creating electron - hole pairs in the conduction band , whereas the number of @xmath4-electrons is conserved at each site . using @xmath97",
    ", @xmath32 can be decomposed into a sum of eigenmodes of the unperturbed liouville operator .",
    "the lowest order solution of the generator of the unitary transformation is @xmath98 , which is given by @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the projection operator which removes from @xmath32 all transitions with energy transfers larger than @xmath43 .",
    "note that the same operator form also appears in the non - perturbative calculation below .",
    "the unitary transformation leads to the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath101 , which can be written as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 gives rise to the transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath104 but has no diagonal elements .",
    "the choice of @xmath104 is not unique , and each particular case requires a physical intuition .",
    "but in any case it has to be such that the thermal averages which appear in the procedure can be evaluated . for the falicov - kimball model , the choice which emphasizes the weak coupling limit , is @xmath105 where @xmath106 ,",
    "@xmath107 , and @xmath108 are the renormalized parameters which are calculated below .",
    "note that the interaction parameter @xmath2 will not change in the renormalization procedure below so that a @xmath43-dependence of @xmath2 is not considered from the beginning .",
    "the second term in is a new density - density interaction between the localized electrons which is generated during the renormalization procedure .",
    "additional higher order operator terms , which are also generated by the renormalization , are neglected . the original model ( @xmath109 )",
    "is defined by the initial condition , according to , @xmath110    once we have made the ansatz and for the operator structure of @xmath111 and @xmath103 , we reduce the cutoff to @xmath112 to find the new effective hamiltonian @xmath113 with renormalized parameters . the new hamiltonian is such that @xmath114 does not give rise to transitions with energy transfers larger than @xmath115 ( with respect to the new unperturbed part @xmath116 ) .",
    "@xmath77 should have the same operator structure as @xmath117 , however with renormalized parameters @xmath118      for the explicit evaluation of the unitary transformation we need the generator @xmath119 .",
    "we make the following ansatz @xmath120 here @xmath121 is a product of @xmath122-functions @xmath123 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which project all the operators in @xmath119 on the shell between @xmath43 and @xmath124 .",
    "more precisely , the energy differences @xmath125 and @xmath126 in refer to the two different hamiltonians @xmath117 and @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , the two @xmath122-functions in take into account that @xmath128 possesses only transition elements with energy transfer @xmath129 , whereas in @xmath127 no transitions with @xmath130 are allowed .",
    "the coefficients @xmath131 are determined below , using the condition @xmath132 .",
    "again , the form of @xmath119 is suggested by its lowest order expression according to ( compare ( ) ) .",
    "the unitarity of the transformation requires @xmath133 , so that @xmath131 has to be antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "expanding the exponentials in the transformation can be written as , @xmath136 where @xmath137 $ ] , @xmath138 $ ] , etc .",
    "the commutators are evaluated in appendix a. the basic approximation of the prm approach is to replace some of the operators generated by @xmath75 by ensemble averages , so as to keep the structure of @xmath128 invariant during the renormalization procedure . this additional",
    "factorization enables us to resum the series in .      by comparing the respective operators in with those obtained from one",
    "finds renormalization equations for the parameters of @xmath128 .",
    "first , from the prefactors of @xmath139 one obtains @xmath140 similarly , by comparing the coefficients of @xmath141 one finds @xmath142 the renormalization equation for the interaction parameter @xmath143 between @xmath4-electrons is best expressed in terms of its fourier transform @xmath144 , @xmath145 where @xmath146 denotes the second and third term on the r.h.s .  with the wave vector @xmath147 replaced by @xmath148 .",
    "in this way , the exact sum rule @xmath149 is fulfilled which guarantees that only sites with @xmath150 contribute to @xmath151 . finally ,",
    "also the renormalization equation for the energy shift @xmath152 can be obtained which will not be given explicitly .",
    "the other new quantities in eqs .   to are defined as follows @xmath153 finally we have to determine the coefficients @xmath131 of the unitary transformation .",
    "they follow from the condition @xmath154 , which removes from @xmath155 all the operators giving rise to the transitions with energy transfers larger than @xmath156 .",
    "one finds @xmath157    note that the @xmath131 depend on the parameters at cutoff @xmath43 as well as from the reduced cutoff @xmath158 .",
    "the presence of @xmath159 on both sides of eq .",
    "means that @xmath131 has to be specified only for those values of @xmath134 and @xmath160 which are on the shell defined by the condition @xmath161 .",
    "off - the - shell coefficients can take any value and , in what follows , we use @xmath162 for @xmath163 .",
    "note that expression includes @xmath2 to all orders .",
    "however , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath164 , the coefficients @xmath165 become linear in @xmath2 since all higher order terms vanish for @xmath166 . in the actual numerical evaluation of the renormalization equations on a lattice of finite size",
    "@xmath19 the excitation energies ( @xmath167 ) may become very small for @xmath168 so that the expansion of @xmath165 to linear order in @xmath2 breaks down . in this case , the full expression has to be taken .    by help of one",
    "finds for the parameters @xmath169 of @xmath170    equations to represent the final renormalization equations for the parameters of the hamiltonian as the energy cutoff is reduced from @xmath43 to @xmath71 .",
    "the overall renormalization starts from the original cutoff @xmath171 , where the initial parameters are given by . for the parameters @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 , which contain expectation values , an appropriate choice is taken at cutoff @xmath30 . using these quantities we obtain from the renormalization equations to the renormalized parameters at the smaller cutoff @xmath175 .",
    "the procedure is repeated until the cutoff is reduced to zero . at @xmath176",
    ", we obtain the completely renormalized hamiltonian @xmath177 , which describes an effectively decoupled system of free conduction electrons and interacting localized electrons , @xmath178 where @xmath179 the fully renormalized parameters are defined as @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "note that for @xmath168 the interaction @xmath103 has completely vanished due to the @xmath122-function in . using @xmath182",
    "we next can recalculate the statistical averages @xmath183 , @xmath174 , etc .",
    ", which appear in eqs .",
    " , to find new values for the renormalized coupling parameters .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the self - consistency is reached .",
    "note that the hamiltonian @xmath184 for the localized electrons is usually denoted as the lattice gas model .",
    "due to the dependence of @xmath185 on @xmath186 , the interaction in @xmath184 is not necessarily restricted to nearest neighbors .",
    "let us add two side remarks : the first one concerns the validity of the present approach . as is obvious from the renormalization procedure in sect .",
    "ii we are here dealing with a weak - coupling approach .",
    "the coulomb interaction @xmath2 is taken as the small quantity which is successively integrated out in the procedure .",
    "however in each renormalization step not only the lowest order in @xmath2 is included . instead",
    ", certain renormalization contributions up to infinite order in @xmath2 are taken into account .",
    "therefore , we expect the present approach to be valid for @xmath2 values which are less or at most of the order of the hopping term @xmath187 . for larger values of @xmath2 either newly generated renormalization terms would have to be added",
    ". or , more appropriate for large @xmath2 would be to take the dominant @xmath2 term as part of a new unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath31 and the hopping term as part of the new perturbation @xmath32 .",
    "the second remark applies to the optimal choice of the renormalization interval @xmath188 .",
    "it is best determined by the size of the system , i.e. , by the requirement that the energy shell contains only a few @xmath134-points .",
    "thus , the number of @xmath67 intervals should be of the order of the lattice size @xmath19 . for a larger number of intervals",
    "the result would be the same since more steps occur without renormalization since no transition energies fit into the interval .",
    "on the other hand a smaller number of @xmath67 intervals leads to a quite large renormalization in some steps since many @xmath134-points could contribute in these intervals . in practise , for a given @xmath19",
    "we have increased the number of intervals until the renormalization does not change any more .",
    "the renormalization equations depend on expectation values @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 which have been defined with the full hamiltonian @xmath85 . since thermal averages are invariant with respect to a unitary transformations , we can do the averaging with the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath182 , provided we also transform the operators , @xmath192    to evaluate @xmath193 one needs the renormalization equations for the operators @xmath194 , where @xmath195 .",
    "for @xmath196 we use the following ansatz , @xmath197 where @xmath198 and @xmath199 are @xmath43-dependent coefficients .",
    "the operator structure of @xmath196 in is again taken from the first order expansion in @xmath2 .",
    "all higher order terms are neglected .",
    "the renormalization equations for the new parameters can be derived in close analogy to the renormalization of @xmath128 .",
