    "since the close of the past century , an increasing number of observational results have transformed radically our view and understanding of the universe . from these observations a consistent picture has emerged indicating that we live in a _ dark pressure _ ( or _ dark energy _ ) dominated universe , whose the current rate of expansion is an increasing function of time .",
    "if confirmed , this extra component , or rather , its gravitational effects , will be the very first observational piece of evidence for new physics beyond the domain of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "such a expectation has , in turn , given rise to many speculations on the fundamental nature of the dark component which dominates the current dynamics of the universe ( see , e.g , @xcite for a recent review ) .    among several alternatives to this dark energy problem , a very interesting one suggests modifications in gravity instead of any adjustment to the energy content of the universe .",
    "examples of modified gravity models include , among others , scenarios with higher order curvature - invariant modifications of the einstein - hilbert action @xcite and braneworld ( bw ) cosmologies @xcite .",
    "while in the first case the _ natural _ matter dilution in the expanding universe is avoided by adding high order terms to the gravitational sector of the theory , in the latter example our 4-dimensional universe is thought of as a surface or a brane embedded into a higher dimensional bulk space - time on which only gravity could propagate .",
    "if such extra dimensions were unambiguosly detected from cosmological observations , bw models could not only give a solution to the so - called dark energy problem but also provide a natural explanation for the huge difference between the two fundamental energy scales in nature , namely , the electroweak and planck scales [ @xmath2 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recently , many attempts to observationally detect or distinguish brane effects from the usual dark energy physics have been discussed in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance , sahni and shtanov investigated a class of bw models which admit a wider range of possibilities for the dark pressure than do the usual dark energy scenarios .",
    "as shown by these authors ( also in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a new and interesting feature of this class of models is that the acceleration of the universe may be a transient phenomena , which can not be achieved in the context of our current standard scenario , i.e. , the @xmath1cdm model but could reconcile the supernova evidence for an accelerating universe with the requirements of string / m - theory @xcite ( see also @xcite for other theoretical and observational aspects of bw models ) .",
    "another particularly interesting bw model is the one proposed by dvali _",
    "@xcite , which is widely refered to as dgp model .",
    "this scenario describes a self - accelerating 5-dimensional bw model with a noncompact , infinite - volume extra dimension in which the dynamics of gravitational interaction is governed by a competition between a 4-dimensional ricci scalar term , induced on the brane , and an ordinary 5-dimensional einstein - hilbert action . for scales below a crossover radius @xmath3 ( where the induced 4-dimensional ricci scalar dominates ) ,",
    "the gravitational force experienced by two punctual sources is the usual 4-dimensional @xmath4 force whereas for distance scales larger than @xmath3 the gravitational force follows the 5-dimensional @xmath5 behavior where @xmath6 is the number of spatial dimensions . ] .",
    "the theoretical consistency of the model , and in particular of its self - accelerating solution , is still a matter of debate in the current literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "from the observational viewpoint , however , dgp models have been successfully tested in many of their predictions , ranging from local gravity to cosmological observations @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent review on the dgp phenomenology ) .",
    "in this paper we are particularly interested in testing the viability of dgp scenarios from cosmological time measurements , i.e. , observations of lookback time to galaxy clusters at intermediary and high redshifts and recent estimates of the total age of the universe . in order to build up the lookback time sample we use the age estimates of @xmath7 160 galaxy clusters at six redshifts lying in the interval @xmath8 , as compiled by capozziello _",
    "@xcite , and assume the total expanding age of the universe to be @xmath9 gyr , as obtained by mactavish _",
    "@xcite from an analysis involving the most recent large - scale structure ( lss ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data .",
    "we also show that the constraints from lookback time observations on the parameters of the model are orthogonal to those obtained from recent measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations at @xmath0 @xcite , providing very restrictive bounds on dgp cosmologies . in agreement with other independent analyses",
    ", it is shown that spatially closed dgp models are largely favoured by the current data .    0.1 in",
    "in dgp models , the modified friedmann s equation due to the presence of an infinite - volume extra dimension reads @xcite @xmath10^{2 } = h^{2 } + \\frac{k}{r(t)^{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the hubble parameter and the energy density of the cosmic fluid ( which we will assume to be composed only of nonrelativistic particles ) , @xmath13 is the spatial curvature parameter , @xmath14 is the planck mass and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the 5-dimensional reduced planck mass ) is the crossover scale defining the gravitational interaction among particles located on the brane . note that for values of @xmath17 , dgp and the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) models are analogous so that the cosmological evolution for the early stages of the universe is exactly the same in both scenarios .    equation ( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath18^{2 } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the current value of the hubble parameter ) , @xmath21 and @xmath22 stand for the matter and curvature density parameters , respectively , and @xmath23 is the density parameter associated to the crossover radius @xmath3 .",
    "note still that the general normalization condition in dgp scenarios is given by @xmath24^{2 } = 1,\\ ] ] while for a flat universe ( @xmath25 ) , it reduces to @xmath26 . as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the above described cosmology can be exactly reproduced by the standard one plus an additional dark energy component with a time - dependent equation of state parameter @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    as shown by several authors @xcite , for values of the length scale @xmath30",
    "( see also table i ) , the presence of an infinite - volume extra dimension as described above leads to a late - time acceleration of the universe , in agreement with most of the current distance - based cosmological observations . in the next section ,",
    "differently from the above analyses , we test the viability of these scenarios from time measurements , i.e. , measurements of lookback time to galaxy clusters and recent estimates of the age of the universe ( see also @xcite for an analysis involving age estimates of high-@xmath31 objects in the context of bw models ) .",
    "in his seminal _ observational tests for world models _ , sandage @xcite defines the lookback time as the difference between the present age of the universe ( @xmath32 ) and its age ( @xmath33 ) when a particular light ray at redshift @xmath31 was emitted . for many years , this interesting relation ( which involves the main cosmological parameters )",
    "was used as a cosmological probe only in a qualitative way due exclusively to the lack of reliable age data . only more recently , with the advent of large telescopes and new technics , it was possible to estimate with reasonable precision ages of high-@xmath31 objects , including galaxies , quasars and galaxy clusters ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    here",
    ", in order to discuss age constraints on the bw scenarios presented above , we use the age estimates of @xmath7 160 galaxy clusters at six redshifts distributed in the interval @xmath8 , as compiled by capozziello _",
    "the clusters at intermediary redshifts ( i.e. , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) have their age estimated from the color of their reddest galaxies , whereas for the two at lower redshifts and the high-@xmath31 galaxy clusters at @xmath37 @xcite , it was used the color scattering from a large sample of low redshifts sdss clusters imaged @xcite ( see sec .",

    "now , following capozziello",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , let us consider an object ( e.g. , a galaxy , a quasar or a galaxy cluster ) at redshift @xmath43 whose the age @xmath44 is defined as the difference between the age of the universe at @xmath43 and the one when the object was born ( at its formation redshift @xmath45 ) , i.e. , @xmath46\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or , equivalently , @xmath47 ( see the schema presented in fig .",

    "@xcite , two important aspects concerning the above equations should be emphasized at this point .",
    "first , that we have included a prior on the total age of the universe  the second term of eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this additional term is the well - known fact that the evolution of the age of the universe with redshift ( @xmath59 ) may differ considerably from scenario to scenario , which means that it is possible that cosmological models that are able to explain age estimates of high-@xmath31 objects may not be compatible with the total expanding age at @xmath60 ( and vice - versa ) ",
    "see @xcite for an example .",
    "the second aspect concerns the delay factor @xmath49 .",
    "note that while the observed lookback time @xmath61 [ eq .",
    "( [ lookobs ] ) ] depends explicitely on @xmath49 its theoretical value @xmath62 [ eq .",
    "( [ looktheo ] ) ] does not .",
    "moreover , it is also worth mentioning that in principle it must be different for each object in the sample . here , however , the delay factor @xmath49 is assumed as a  nuisance \" parameter , so that we marginalize it over the interval [ 0 , 20 ] gyr .    in fig .",
    "2a we show the binned data of the lookback time plotted as a function of redshift for a fixed value of @xmath63 gyr and some selected values of the density parameters @xmath21 and @xmath41 . for the sake of comparison , the einstein - de sitter model and standard @xmath1cdm prediction ( with @xmath64 and @xmath65 )",
    "are also shown .",
    "figure 2b shows the first results of our statistical analysis .",
    "confidence regions ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) in the @xmath68 space are displayed by considering the lookback time measurements discussed above .",
    "note that the area corresponding to the confidence intervals is not very restrictive , a fact that is expected and understood in terms of the conservative uncertainty assumed ( @xmath55 gyr ) for the individual lookback time ( see fig .",
    "2a ) gyr is a conservative assumption , in the sense that if the uncertainty on the galaxy cluster age were so large , then there also should be observed a large scatter in the color - magnitude relation for the reddest cluster galaxies , which is not .",
    "however , to take into account other systematic uncertainties as , for instance , those relative to the evolutionary model , we consider that the value assumed , although conservative , is well applicable . ] .",
    "the best - fit parameters for this analysis are @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which corresponds to a spatially closed scenario , in agreement with other independent analyses .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if , however , the gaussian prior on the matter density parameter @xmath71 ( as given by wmap results @xcite ) is assumed , the new best - fit model is found at @xmath64 and @xmath72 . by restricting the analysis to the flat case ,",
    "we note that the data favour a lower value of the matter density parameter , i.e. , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) at 95.4% ( c.l . ) . also , if we compare the flat cases of dgp and @xmath1cdm scenarios , we find that the former is disfavored , with @xmath75 .",
    "as well known , the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy power spectrum is an efficient way for determining cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because the acoustic oscillations in the relativistic plasma of the early universe will also be imprinted on to the late - time power spectrum of the non - relativistic matter @xcite , the acoustic signatures in the large - scale clustering of galaxies yield additional tests for cosmology . in particular",

    "this , therefore , suggests that possible degeneracies between these parameters may be broken by combining these two kinds of observations in a joint statistical analysis .",
    "the results of such an analysis are shown in fig . 2c .",
    "note that the parameter space now is considerably reduced relative to the former analysis , with the best - fit model occurring at @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "we have explored the constraints on the parameter space of the dgp scenario from measurements of lookback time to galaxy clusters and the age of the universe .",
    "it is shown that the lookback time observations provide complementary and interesting constraints on the parameters of the model , though there is a degeneracy between @xmath21 and @xmath99 .",
    "when we further combined the recent measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations at @xmath0 found in the sloan digital sky survey data , a very stringent constraint on both @xmath21 and @xmath99 is obtained .",
