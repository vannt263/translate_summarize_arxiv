    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has received further confirmation with the discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite , however , there are strong hints of physics it can not explain , such as neutrino oscillations  @xcite and the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon  @xcite . furthermore , the sm does not provide a dark matter ( dm ) candidate usually advocated as an explanation of the numerous gravitational anomalies observed in the universe . many extensions of the sm  @xcite consider a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) as a viable dm candidate and assume that wimps are charged under a new kind of interaction .",
    "the mediator of the new force would be a gauge vector boson , the @xmath0  boson , also referred to as a dark photon or @xmath11 .",
    "it would be produced during wimp annihilations , have a mass less than two proton masses , and a leptonic decay channel in order to explain the astrophysical observations recently reported by many experiments  @xcite . in the minimal theoretical model ,",
    "the @xmath0  boson is the lightest particle of the dark sector and can couple to the ordinary sm photon only through loops of heavy dark particles charged under both sm  u(1)@xmath12 and dark u(1)@xmath13 symmetries  @xcite .",
    "these higher - order interactions would open a so - called kinetic mixing portal described in the theory by the lagrangian term @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the sm hypercharge gauge field tensor and @xmath16 is the dark field tensor .",
    "the @xmath17 parameter represents the mixing strength and is the ratio of the dark and electromagnetic coupling constants . in principle , the dark photon could be produced in any process in which a virtual or real photon is involved but the rate is suppressed due to the very small coupling ( @xmath18 ) . in this respect ,",
    "high - luminosity @xmath19(gev)-energy @xmath2@xmath3 colliders play a crucial role in dark photon searches  @xcite .",
    "we investigated the @xmath5 process by considering the @xmath0  boson decaying into @xmath20 . at the level of coupling accessible by kloe in this channel the @xmath0  boson",
    "is expected to decay promplty leaving its signal as a resonant peak in the invariant - mass distribution of the lepton pair .",
    "the energy scan was performed by applying the radiative return method which consists of selecting the events in which either electron or positron emits an initial - state radiation ( isr ) photon which carries away a part of the energy and effectively changes the amount of the energy available for @xmath0  boson production .",
    "the selected initial- and final - state particles are the same as in the radiative bhabha scattering process so we receive contributions from resonant @xmath21-channel , non - resonant @xmath22-channel @xmath0  boson exchanges , and from @xmath21-@xmath22  interference .",
    "the finite - width effects related to @xmath21-channel annihilation sub - processes , scattering @xmath22-channel and @xmath21-@xmath22  interference are of order of @xmath23 for the integrated cross section and can be neglected with respect to any potential resonance we would observe ; @xmath24@xmath25  mev for the coupling strengths to which we are sensitive  @xcite .",
    "the non - resonant @xmath22-channel effects would not produce a peak in the invariant - mass distribution but could , in principle , appear in analyses of angular distributions or asymmetries .",
    "we are going to report exclusively on resonant @xmath21-channel @xmath0  boson production .    using a sample of kloe data collected during 20042005 ,",
    "corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.54  fb@xmath4 , we derived a new limit on the kinetic mixing parameter , @xmath7 , approaching the dielectron mass threshold .",
    "the frascati @xmath26 factory , da@xmath1ne , is an @xmath2@xmath3 collider running mainly at a center - of - mass energy of 1.0195  gev , the mass of the @xmath26 meson .",
    "equal energy electron and positron beams collide at an angle of @xmath2725  mrad , producing @xmath26 mesons nearly at rest .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber ( dc )  @xcite with a 25  cm internal radius , 2  m outer radius , and 3.3  m length , comprising @xmath2756,000 wires for a total of about 12,000 drift cells .",
    "it is filled with a low-@xmath28 ( 90%  helium , 10%  isobutane ) gas mixture and provides a momentum resolution of @xmath29  0.4% .",
    "the dc is surrounded by a lead - scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc )  @xcite composed of a cylindrical barrel and two end - caps providing 98% coverage of the total solid angle .",
    "calorimeter modules are read out at both ends by 4880 photomultiplier tubes , ultimately resulting in an energy resolution of @xmath30 and a time resolution of @xmath31 = 57  @xmath32  100  ps . a superconducting coil around the emc provides a 0.52  t field to measure the momentum of charged particles . a cross sectional diagram of the kloe detector is shown in figure  [ fig : kloe_cross_section ] .    the trigger  @xcite uses energy deposition in the calorimeter and drift chamber hit multiplicity .",
    "to minimize backgrounds the trigger system includes a second - level cosmic - ray muon veto based on energy deposition in the outermost layers of the calorimeter , followed by a software background filter based on the topology and multiplicity of energy clusters and drift chamber hits to reduce beam background . a downscaled sample is retained to evaluate the filter efficiency .",
    "using 1.54  fb@xmath4 of kloe data we have searched for @xmath0  boson production in the process @xmath5 followed by @xmath6 .",
    "the center - of - mass energy of the collision depends on the amount of energy carried away by the initial - state radiation ( isr ) photon .",
    "the irreducible background originates from the @xmath33 radiative bhabha scattering process , having the same three final - state particles .",
    "the reducible backgrounds consist of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( where one photon converts into an @xmath20 pair ) , and @xmath37 , as well as other @xmath26 decays .",
    "the expected @xmath0  boson signal would appear as a resonant peak in the invariant - mass distribution of the @xmath20 pair , @xmath38 .",
    "this search differs from the previous kloe searches  @xcite in its capability to probe the low mass region close to the dielectron mass threshold .",
    "we selected events with three separate calorimeter energy deposits corresponding to two oppositely - charged lepton tracks and a photon .",
    "the final - state electron , positron , and photon were required to be emitted at large angle ( @xmath39 ) with respect to the beam axis , such that they are explicitly detected in the barrel of the calorimeter , see figure  [ fig : kloe_cross_section ] .",
    "the large - angle selection greatly suppresses the @xmath22-channel contribution from the irreducible bhabha - scattering background which is strongly peaked at small angle .",
    "since we are interested mostly in the low invariant - mass region , we select only events with a hard photon , @xmath40  mev , chosen to select a subsample of the events generated by our mc simulation",
    ". we required both lepton tracks to have a first dc hit within a radius of 50  cm from the beam axis and a point - of - closest - approach ( pca ) to the beam axis within the fiducial cylinder , @xmath41  cm and @xmath42  cm , entirely contained within the vacuum pipe eliminating background events from photons converting on the vacuum wall .",
    "we eliminated tightly spiralling tracks by requiring either a large transverse or a large longitudinal momentum for each of the lepton tracks , @xmath43  mev / c or @xmath44  mev / c .",
    "we require that the total momentum of the charged tracks is @xmath45  me-.06em v-.05em /-.02em c to avoid the presence of poorly reconstructed tracks .",
    "a pseudo - likelihood discriminant was used to separate electrons from muons and pions  @xcite .",
    "a further discrimination from muons and pions was achieved using the @xmath46 variable .",
    "@xmath46 is the @xmath47 mass for an @xmath48 final state , computed using energy and momentum conservation , assuming @xmath49  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : track_mass ] the @xmath46 distribution is reported for measured data and for all the relevant mc simulated background components . including the cut @xmath50",

    "the measurement data set was prescaled for @xmath52  me-.06em v-.05em /-.02em c@xmath51 .",
    "the track mass variable peaks at the mass of the charged track in the final state for events with two charged tracks and a photon .",
    "the selection region is @xmath50  me-.06em v-.05em /-.02em c@xmath51 . ]",
    "we used mc event generators interfaced with the full kloe detector simulation , geanfi  @xcite , including detector resolutions and beam conditions on a run - by - run basis , to estimate the level of background contamination due to all of the processes listed in the previous section . excluding the irreducible background from radiative bhabha scattering events , the contamination from the sum of residual backgrounds after all analysis cuts is less than 1.5% in the whole @xmath38 range , and none of the background shapes are peaked , eliminating the possibility of a background mimicking the resonant @xmath0  boson signal .",
    "the irreducible bhabha scattering background was simulated using the babayaga - nlo  @xcite event generator implemented within geanfi ( including the @xmath21- , @xmath22- , and @xmath21-@xmath22 interference channels ) and is shown in figure  [ fig : m_ee_distribution ] along with the measured data after subtracting the non - irreducible background components .",
    "no signal peak is observed .        in order to evaluate the @xmath0  boson selection efficiency we used a modified version of the babayaga - nlo event generator implemented within geanfi , such that the radiative bhabha scattering process was only allowed to proceed via the annihilation channel , in which the @xmath0  boson resonance would occur . in order to create a large - statistics sample in our region of interest we restricted the",
    "babayaga - nlo generated events to within @xmath53 and @xmath54  mev .",
    "the generator - level efficiency due to this restriction was evaluated using a phokhara mc simulation  @xcite .",
    "the total efficiency is evaluated as the product of the generator - level efficiency and the event - selection efficiency , containing the cuts in section  [ sec : selection ] conditioned to the generator - level restriction as well as the trigger efficiency , and is shown in figure  [ fig : efficiency ] .",
    "the decrease in efficiency as @xmath55 comes from the requirement on the total momentum of the charged tracks .",
