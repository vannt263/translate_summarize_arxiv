    "gravitational wave astronomy , experimental cosmology and high energy physics will soon experience a boost thanks to the forthcoming interferometric detectors . from a theoretical point of view",
    "it is then interesting to compare our theoretical expectations / speculations with the foreseen sensitivities of the various devices in a frequency range which complements and greatly extends the information we can derive from the analysis of the microwave sky and of its temperature fluctuations .    by focusing our attention on relic gravitons of primordial origin",
    "we can say that virtually every variation in the time evolution of the curvature scale can imprint important informations on the stochastic gravitational wave background @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the precise evolution of the curvature scale is not known .",
    "different cosmological scenarios , based on different physical models of the early universe may lead to different energy spectra of relic gravitons and this crucial theoretical indetermination can affect the expected signal",
    ".    of particular interest seems to be the case where the logarithmic energy density of the relic gravitons ( in critical units ) grows @xcite in the frequency region explored by the interferometric detectors ( i.e. , approximately between few hz and @xmath1 khz ) @xcite . in this range",
    "we can parametrize the energy density of the relic gravitons @xmath2 at the present time @xmath3 as @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the typical amplitude of the spectrum and @xmath6 is a monotonic function of the frequency at least in the interval @xmath7 .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath6 can depend on the parameters of the particular model .",
    "the assumption that @xmath6 is monotonic can certainly be seen as a restriction of our analysis , but , at the same time , we can notice that the models with growing logarithmic energy spectra which were discussed up to now in the litterature fit in our choice for @xmath6 .",
    "within the parametrization defined in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) we will be discussing the cases where the spectral slope @xmath8 ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) is either blue ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) or violet ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) .",
    "in general we could have also the case @xmath12 ( red spectra ) and @xmath13 ( flat spectrum ) .",
    "flat spectra have been extensively studied in the context of ordinary inflationary models @xcite and in relation to cosmic string models @xcite .",
    "blue and violet spectra are physically peculiar since they are typically produced in models which are different from the ones leading to flat spectra . in quintessential inflationary models",
    "@xcite the logarithmic energy spectra are typically blue @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this class of models an ordinary inflationary phase is followed by an expanding phase whose dynamics is driven by an effective equation of state which is stiffer than radiation @xcite . since the equation of state ( after the end of inflation ) is stiffer than the one of radiation , then the universe will expand slower than in a radiation dominated phase and , therefore , @xmath8 turns out to be at most one ( up to logarithmic corrections ) .    in string",
    "cosmological models @xcite the graviton spectra can be either blue ( if the physical scale corresponding to a present frequency of @xmath14 hz went out of the horizon during the string phase ) or violet ( if the relevant scale crossed the horizon during the dilaton driven phase ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the sensitivity of pairs of interferometric detectors to blue and violet spectra of relic quintessential gravitons .",
    "the reason for such an exercise is twofold . on one hand violet and blue spectra , owing to their growth in frequency , might provide signals which are larger than in the case of flat inflationary spectra . on the other hand",
    "the sensitivity to blue spectra from quintessential inflation can be different from the one computed in the case of flat spectra from ordinary inflationary models .",
    "indeed , it is sometimes common practice to compare the theoretical energy density of the produced gravitons with the sensitivity of various interferometers to a flat spectrum .",
    "this is , strictly speaking , arbitrary even if , sometimes this procedure might lead to correct order of magnitude estimates .    in order to illustrate qualitatively this point",
    "let us consider the general expression of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the case of correlation of two detectors of arbitrary geometry for an observation time @xmath15 . by assuming that the intrinsic noises of the detectors are stationary , gaussian , uncorrelated , much larger in amplitude than the gravitational strain , and statistically independent on the strain itself , one has @xcite : of the detectors",
    "is defined as : s=_-t/2^t/2d t_-t/2^t/2d t s_1 ( t)s_2 ( t)q ( t , t ) , where @xmath16 is a filter function .",
    "since @xmath17 is quadratic in the signals , with the usual definitions , it contributes to the snr squared . ]",
    "@xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the present value of the hubble parameter and @xmath20 depends upon the geometry of the two detectors ; in the case of the correlation between two interferometers @xmath21 ) . in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath22 is the ( one - sided ) noise power spectrum of the @xmath23-th @xmath24 detector , while @xmath25 is the overlap reduction function @xcite which is determined by the relative locations and orientations of the two detectors",
    ". this function cuts off ( effectively ) the integrand at a frequency @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the separation between the two detectors .    from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) we can see that the frequency dependence of the signal directly enters in the determination of the snr and , therefore , we can expect different values of the integral depending upon the relative frequency dependence of the signal and of the noise power spectra associated with the detectors .",
    "hence , in order to get precise information on the sensitivities of various detectors to blue and violet spectra we have to evaluate the snr for each specific model at hand .",
    "the analysis of the snr is certainly compelling if we want to confront quantitatively our theoretical conclusions with the forthcoming data .",
    "owing to the differrence among the various logarithmic energy spectra of the relic gravitons we can wonder if different detector pairs can be more or less sensitive to a specific theoretical model .",
    "we will try , when possible , to state our conclusions in such a way that our results could be used not only in the specific cases discussed in the present paper .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii we will review the basic features of blue spectra arising in quintessential inflationary models . in section iii we will set up the basic definitions and conventions concerning the evaluation of the snr . in section",
    "iv we will be mainly concerned with the analysis of the achievable sensitivities to some specific theoretical model .",
    "section v contains our concluding remarks .",
    "blue and violet logarithmic energy spectra of relic gravitons are phenomenologically allowed @xcite . at low frequencies",
    "the most constraining bound @xcite comes from the cobe observations @xcite of the first ( thirty ) multipole moments of the temperature fluctuations in the microwave sky which implies that @xmath28 has to be smaller than @xmath29 for frequencies of the order of @xmath19 . at intermediate frequencies",
    "( i.e. , @xmath30 hz ) the pulsar timing measurements @xcite imply that @xmath31 should not exceed @xmath32 . in order to be compatible with the homogeneous and isotropic nucleosynthesis scenario @xcite",
    "we should require that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fraction of critical energy density in the form of radiation at the present observation time . in eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) the integral extends over all the modes present inside the horizon at the nucleosynthesis time . in the case of blue and violet logarithmic energy spectra the cobe and pulsar bounds are less relevant than the nucleosynthesis one and it",
    "is certainly allowed to have growing spectra without conflicting with any of the bounds .",
    "recent measurements of the red - shift luminosity relation in type ia supernovae @xcite suggest the presence of an effective cosmological term whose energy density can be as large as @xmath35 in critical units . needless to say that this energy density is huge",
    "if compared with cosmological constant one would guess , for instance , from electroweak ( spontaneous ) symmetry breaking , i.e. , @xmath36 . in order to cope with this problem various models",
    "have been proposed @xcite and some of them rely on the existence of some scalar field ( the quintessence field ) whose effective potential has no minimum @xcite . therefore , according to this proposal the evolution of the quintessence field is dominated today by the potential providing then the wanted ( time - dependent ) cosmological term . in the past",
    "the evolution of the quintessence field is in general not dominated by the potential .",
    "the crucial idea behind quintessential inflationary models is the identification of the inflaton @xmath37 with the quintessence field @xcite .",
    "therefore , the inflaton / quintessence potential @xmath38 will lead to a slow - rolling phase of de sitter type for @xmath39 and it will have no minimum for @xmath40 . hence , _ after _ the inflationary epoch ( but _ prior to _ nucleosynthesis ) the universe will be dominated by @xmath41 .",
    "this means , physically , that the effective speed of sound of the sources driving the background geometry during the post - inflationary phase will be drastically different from the one of radiation ( i.e. , @xmath42 in natual units ) and it will have a typical stiff form ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) . the fact that in the post - inflationary phase the effective speed of sound equals the speed of light has important implications for the gravitational wave spectra as it was investigated in the past for a broad range of equations of state stiffer than radiation ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that if an inflationary phase is followed by a phase whose effective equation of state is stiffer than radiation , then , the high frequency branch of the graviton spectra will grow in frequency .",
    "the tilt depends upon the speed of sound and it is , in our notations , @xmath45 we can immediately see that for all the range of stiff equations of state ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) we will have that @xmath46 .",
    "the case @xmath47 corresponds to @xmath48 .",
    "this simply means that if the inflationary phase is immediately followed by the ordinary radiation - dominated phase the spectrum will be ( as we know very well ) flat .",
    "the case @xmath49 is the most interesting for the case of quintessential inflation . in this case",
    "the tilt is maximal ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) .",
    "moreover , a more precise calculation @xcite shows that the graviton spectrum is indeed logarithmically corrected as @xmath51 it is amusing to notice that this logarithmic correction occurs only in the case @xmath43 but not in the case of the other stiff ( post - inflationary ) background . the typical frequency @xmath52 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ qes ] ) is given , today , by @xmath53 apart from the dependence upon the number of relativistic degrees of freedom ( i.e. , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) which is a trivial consequence of the red - sfhit , @xmath56 does also depend upon @xmath57 which is the number of ( minimally coupled ) scalar degrees of freedom present during the inflationary phase .",
    "the amplitude of the spectrum depends upon @xmath57 as @xmath58 the reason for the presence of @xmath57 is that all the minimally coupled scalar degrees of freedom present during the inflationary phase will be amplified sharing approximately the same spectrum of the two polarizations of the gravitons @xcite .",
    "the main physical difference is that the @xmath57 scalars are directly coupled to fermions and , therefore , they will decay and thermalize thanks to gauge interactions @xcite . if minimally coupled scalars would not be present ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) the model would not be consistent since the universe will be dominated by gravitons with ( non - thermal ) spectrum given by eq .",
    "( [ qes ] ) .",
    "the energy density of the quanta associated with the minimally coupled scalars , amplified thanks to the background transition from the inflationary phase to the stiff phase , will decrease with the universe expansion as @xmath60 whereas the energy density of the background will decrease as @xmath61 .",
    "the moment at which the energy density of the background becomes sub - leading marks the beginning of the radiation dominated phase and it takes place at a ( present ) frequency of the order of the mhz @xcite .",
    "notice that this frequency has been obtained by requiring the reheating mechanism to be only gravitational @xcite .",
    "this assumption migh be relaxed by considering different reheating mechanisms @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in order to satisfy the nucleosynthesis constraint in the framework of a quintessential model with gravitational reheating @xcite we have to demand that @xcite @xmath62 where the factor of @xmath63 counts the two polarizations of the gravitons but also the quanta associated with the inflaton and @xmath64 is the number of spin degrees of freedom at @xmath65 . for frequencies",
    "@xmath66 the spectra of the produced gravitons are exponentially suppressed as @xmath67}$ ] .",
    "this is a general feature of the spectra of massless particles produced thanks to the pumping action of the background geometry @xcite ) , a semi - hard branch ( for @xmath68 ) and a hard branch which is the one mainly discussed in the present paper .",
    "the reason for this choice is obvious since the noise power spectra of the interferometric detectors are defined in a band which falls in the region of the hard branch of the theoretical spectrum . ]",
    "in order to detect a stochastic gravitational wave background in an optimal way we have to correlate the outputs of two ( or more ) detectors @xcite . the signal received by a single detector can be thought as the sum of two components : the _ signal _ ( given by the stochastic background itself ) and the _ noise _ associated with each detector s measurement .",
    "the noise level associated with a single detector is , in general , larger than the expected theoretical signal .",
    "this statement holds for most of the single ( operating and/or foreseen ) gravitational waves detectors ( with the possible exception of the lisa space interferometer @xcite ) .",
    "suppose now that instead of a single detectors we have a _ couple _ of detectors or , ideally , _ a network _ of detectors .",
    "the signal registered at each detector will be @xmath69 where the index @xmath70 labels each different detector . if the detectors are sufficiently far apart the ensamble average of the fourier components of the noises is stochastically distributed which means that @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the one - sided noise power spectrum which is usually expressed in seconds . the very same quantity can be defined for the signal . by then assuming the noise levels to be statistically independent of the gravitational strain registered by the detectors we obtain eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "consider now the case of two correlated interferometers and define the following rescaled quantities :    * @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) ; * @xmath75 ; * @xmath76 .",
    "( in this section we will not write the explicit dependence of the theoretical quantities upon @xmath3 : they are meant to be considered at the present time ) .",
    "notice that @xmath77 is ( approximately ) the frequency where the noise power spectra are minimal and @xmath78 is the graviton ( logarithmic ) energy density at the frequency @xmath79 .",
    "therefore the signal - to - noise ratio can be expressed as : @xmath80 where we defined the ( dimension - less ) integral @xmath81 from this last expression we can deduce that the minimum detectable @xmath82 is given by ( 1 yr = @xmath83 s ) @xmath84 for example , by taking @xmath85 hz and @xmath86 s , we get @xmath87 therefore , the estimate of the sensitivity of cross - correlation measurements between two detectors to a given spectrum @xmath88 reduces , in our case , to the calculation of the integral @xmath89 defined in eq .",

    "another important point to stress is that for both the graviton spectra considered , as a consequence of the frequency behavior of @xmath107 and the presence of the weighing factor @xmath108 in the integrand , the main contribution to the integral @xmath89 comes from the region @xmath109 hz .",
    "the cut - off introduced by the overlap reduction function is not so relevant : by assuming @xmath110 over the whole integration domain ( i.e. , considering the correlation of one of the detector with itself ) , the sensitivity increases only by a factor 2.4 in the case of a flat spectrum , and 3.6 in the case of the quintessential one .",

    "as a test for our techniques we first discussed the case of a flat spectrum which has been discussed in the past .",
    "we then applied our results to the case of quintessential inflationary models whose graviton spectra are , in general , characterized by three `` branches '' . a soft branch ( in the far infra - red of the graviton spectrum around @xmath125@xmath126 hz ) , a semi - hard branch ( between @xmath126 hz and @xmath127 hz ) and a truly hard branch ranging , approximately , from @xmath127 hz to @xmath14 ghz .",

    "can be as large as @xmath129 . in spite of",
    "the fact quintessential spectra are growing in frequency the predicted signal is still too small and below the sensitivity achievable by the advanced ligo detectors .",
    "the reason for the smallness of the signal in the region @xmath130 khz is twofold .",
    "on one hand we have to enforce the nucleosynthesis bound on the spectrum . on the other hand , because of the gravitational reheating mechanism adopted , the number of ( minimally coupled ) scalar degrees of freedom needs to be large . it might be possible , in principle , that different reheating mechanisms could change the signal for frequencies comparable with the window of the interferometers .",
    "therefore , the analysis presented in this paper seems to suggest that new techniques ( possibly based on electromagnetic detectors @xcite ) operating in the ghz region should be used in order to directly detect quintessential gravitons .",
