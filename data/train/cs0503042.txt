    "this pessimistic approach is balanced by assuming further that the microcell - to - microcell interference @xmath190 is negligible . here",
    "@xmath190 is the average interference into any microcell base due to a user communicating with any other microcell .",
    "thus , the required sinr equation at microcell @xmath21 is @xmath191 these @xmath175 inequalities can be used to show @xcite that @xmath192 and @xmath193 for all @xmath194 and @xmath195 if and only if @xmath196 a benefit of this simplified capacity condition is that it allows for capacity calculation using @xmath44 and @xmath45 alone . as a result , it is no more complex to determine than is @xmath197 , the user capacity when @xmath198 and @xmath199 , section 2 .",
    "further , as the product @xmath200 is robust to variations in propagation parameters and user distributions , so is the approximation in ( [ eq : cap_multi ] ) . despite its simplified form , this approximation yields a fairly accurate estimate to the attainable user capacity .",
    "+   + a simple extension of the capacity expression in ( [ eq : cap_multi ] ) can now be used to find the user capacity in a _",
    "general _ multicell system , i.e. , a system in which the @xmath172 microcells can be embedded anywhere within the coverage areas of the @xmath173 macrocells .",
    "we first note that , in the general system , each macrocell contains _ on average _ @xmath201 microcells .",
    "next , we use ( [ eq : cap_multi ] ) to determine the user capacity for a multicell system in which there are @xmath173 macrocells but only the center macrocell contains @xmath201 microcells . in this case",
    ", each cell contains , @xmath170 users , where @xmath202 next , we assume that this value of @xmath170 hardly changes when some other macrocell contains ( on average ) @xmath201 embedded microcells .",
    "thus , we can finally approximate the total attainable capacity for the general multicell system as @xmath203 times the result in ( [ eq : cap_multi_2 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath204      the goal here is to develop a calculation for the multicell user capacity in _",
    "finitely dispersive channels _ which is as straightforward to calculate as the capacity expression in ( [ eq : cap_multi_3 ] ) .",
    "although there are several approaches to this problem , we propose an extremely simple and highly accurate approximation method .",
    "first , we compute the diversity factor for the given multipath channel .",
    "next , we make the assumption that systems with the same diversity factor support equivalent numbers of users and we seek to find @xmath205 , the user capacity in a system with @xmath172 microcells , @xmath173 macrocells , and a multipath channel with diversity factor @xmath128 .",
    "we then use the results of section [ varfading_sec ] to compute the total user capacity for a two - cell system , i.e , @xmath206 we also compute the total user capacity for a two - cell system with infinite dispersion , i.e. , @xmath207 we use these two capacities to determine the capacity percentage loss due to dispersion , @xmath208 , for the two - cell system .",
    "this loss is given as @xmath209 finally , we claim and demonstrate through extensive numerical results that the total attainable user capacity in a multicell system with @xmath172 microcells , @xmath173 macrocells , and finite dispersion @xmath128 is simply @xmath208 times the total attainable user capacity of a system with @xmath172 microcells , @xmath173 macrocells , and infinite dispersion , i.e. , @xmath210        we begin with a large square region having side @xmath86 and a macrocell base at its center . a fraction of the total system users are uniformly distributed over this region .",
    "this larger square is divided into @xmath211 squares with side @xmath88 , as shown in figure [ singlesquares ] for @xmath212 .",
    "the smaller squares represent potential high - density regions . in each simulation trial",
    ", we randomly select @xmath172 high density regions ( excluding the center square which contains the macrocell base ) and place a microcell base at the center .",
    "finally , we assume that the @xmath172 microcells have identical values for @xmath213 , @xmath214 , and @xmath97 .",
    "+   + our simulations assume @xmath212 , meaning 24 possible candidate high density regions and the parameters in table 1 . for a given value of @xmath172 , the simulation randomly selects @xmath172 of the 24 high density regions .",
    "a portion of the total user population is uniformly - distributed over the large square region and the remaining users are uniformly distributed over the selected high density regions .",
    "the average fraction of the total user population placed in each region is @xmath215 . as before ,",
    "this was done to ensure that maximal user capacity occurs with high probability @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the simulation then determines the total number of users supported with 5% outage .",
    "this is done for 23 other random selections of @xmath172 high density regions , and the average over these selections is computed as a function of @xmath172 .",
    "+   + we performed the above simulations for uniform channels with @xmath166 and @xmath216 , and for the infinitely dispersive channel .",
    "the results are in figure [ ul_multicell_1a ] .",
    "in addition , we show the attainable user capacities predicted by ( [ eq : cap_multi_3 ] ) and ( [ multi_fading_capacity ] ) .",
    "the simulation points match the corresponding approximations very tightly up to about @xmath217 , corresponding to a microcell _ fill factor _ ( the fraction of macrocellular area served by microcells ) of about one half . in other words ,",
    "our approximation technique works reliably in the domain _ hotspot _ microcells .",
    "we simulated a multiple - macrocell / multiple - microcell system by extending the system studied above .",
    "specifically ( figure [ multimulti_fig ] ) , there are @xmath218 macrocells and @xmath219 candidate high density regions ( locations for microcell bases ) .",
    "we randomly select @xmath172 high density regions from this pool .",
    "we again accrue the average total capacity and its one - standard - deviation spread for the two extreme cases of dispersion , i.e. , infinite dispersion and @xmath166 .",
    "the results for @xmath220 , @xmath212 are in figure [ multi_multi_curve ] . also shown",
    "are the capacities predicted by ( [ eq : cap_multi_3 ] ) and ( [ multi_fading_capacity ] ) for @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "the approximations closely match simulation points up to at least @xmath223 , which translates to roughly eight microcells per macrocell ( fill factor of about one third ) .",
    "thus , the approximation method is reliable in the domain of hotspot microcells .",
    "we first examined the effect of transmit power constraints and cell size on the uplink performance of a two - cell two - tier cdma system .",
    "we then investigated the effect of finite channel dispersion ( which causes variable fading of the output signal power ) on this capacity .",
    "analysis was presented to approximate the uplink capacity of _ any _ channel delay profile using the uniform multipath channel , both with and without terminal power constraints .",
    "finally , we presented an approximation to the uplink user capacity in larger multicell systems with finite dispersion and demonstrated its accuracy using extensive simulation .",
    "+   + while a particular set of system parameters was used in obtaining our numerical results , the analytical approximation methods , and their confirmation via simulations , are quite general .",
    "what we have shown here , first , is that two - tier uplink user capacity can be reliably estimated in a two - cell system for arbitrary pole capacity , channel delay profile , shadow fading variances , transmit power limit , and cell size .",
    "moreover , under realistic conditions on transmit power and cell size ( @xmath224 ) , the method can be extended to the case of multiple macrocells with multiple microcells .",
    "thus , we have developed simple , general and accurate approximation methods for treating a long - standing problem in two - tier cdma systems .",
