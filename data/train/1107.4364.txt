    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is providing an unprecedented probe of top quark properties . while the tevatron has to date collected on the order of a thousand tops , the lhc , with @xmath2 of data has already nearly an order of magnitude more tops .",
    "the improvement is due both to a larger production cross - section , and to improved rapidity coverage for leptons in semi - leptonic and fully leptonic top analyses . in terms of the percentage error on the total cross - section , the 7 tev lhc ( lhc7 ) results are already competitive with the tevatron @xcite with only @xmath4 @xcite , while the invariant mass distribution with just @xmath5 extends to a higher @xmath6 of 2.5 tev @xcite as compared to the tevatron reach of 1.8 tev @xcite . at @xmath2",
    ", the top quark properties will be far better measured than at the tevatron .",
    "at the same time , the tevatron as a @xmath7 machine is better able at the outset to measure a forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "the asymmetry in a particular invariant mass bin , @xmath8 , is defined by @xmath9 with @xmath10 the rapidity difference between a top and an anti - top .",
    "the recent cdf anlaysis shows @xmath11 for @xmath12 gev  @xcite at the parton level ( or @xmath13 at the signal level ) , while the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) standard model ( sm ) predicts much lower values @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 at the signal level )  @xcite , corresponding to a 3.4@xmath16 deviation ( 3.6@xmath16 at signal level ) .",
    "a measurement of the asymmetry with fully leptonic tops has also been made which is roughly consistent with the measurement in the semileptonic channel @xcite .",
    "the d0 collaboration also observes a larger than predicted asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "because this asymmetry is so large , any new physics ( np ) that could generate such an asymmetry must have large couplings to the top as well as to the light quarks in the initial state",
    ". a very large number of models have been proposed in the literature . however , from a phenomenological point of view , these models mainly fall into only two categories according to the nature of the new particle exchange : ( i ) @xmath17-channel exchange of vector mediators ( _ e.g. _ axigluon models )  @xcite or ( ii ) @xmath3-channel exchange of flavor - violating mediators  @xcite .",
    "comparative studies of these models have also been carried out @xcite , and their implications for top observables at the tevatron observed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17-channel mediators often have maximally axial couplings ( though there are exceptions such as @xcite ) , while the @xmath3-channel mediators connect a light quark to the top quark in a way that appears to maximally violate flavor .",
    "a number of studies on the implications of these models for lhc physics have also been carried out @xcite .",
    "there are a large number of possibilities for the spin , color , flavor and electroweak representation of a new field that fits into the two categories mentioned above . in the literature",
    "these have been mostly built and studied one by one . here ,",
    "by contrast , we are motivated to extract _ general _ features to determine which effective vertices are able to generate the large @xmath18 while contributing a small amount to the total cross - section .",
    "we find that the form of the matrix element itself allows one to make general conclusions about which classes of models are successful in generating a significant asymmetry .",
    "we find on general grounds that perturbative cross - section . ]",
    "scalar models typically can produce no more than a @xmath19 `` parton level '' asymmetry for @xmath20 , which is only somewhat larger than the asymmetry produced in the sm ( at @xmath21 ) and well below cdf s parton level central value of @xmath22 . the observed asymmetry . ]",
    "the reason is simply the combination of the mandelstam variables that enters into @xmath3- and @xmath23-channel processes for scalars ; the statement is independent of the color ( singlet , triplet , sextet or octet ) or flavor representation of the state .",
    "by contrast , @xmath3-channel vectors have a matrix element that is conducive to producing a large asymmetry with a relatively small contribution to the total cross - section .",
    "we systematically enumerate the possibilities for the quantum numbers of @xmath3- and @xmath17- channel mediators that can produce an asymmetry and show that classes of models are strongly disfavored based on a small contribution to the total asymmetry or large contribution to the total @xmath1 cross - section at the tevatron .",
    "this paper is intended to be a companion to our earlier paper on @xmath18 @xcite , which carried out a systematic comparison of np models to the data .",
    "this was the only theory paper to carry out the full top reconstruction in order to compare results at the signal level .",
    "we found that there were large acceptance effects which changed the extracted parton level comparison between the sm and the np models .",
    "with lhc data quickly arriving , however , the source of strong constraints is rapidly changing , and we are particularly compelled by the fact that the lhc collaborations are now analyzing unprecedented amounts of top data that will clearly rule out a large swath of models .",
    "we examine observables from the lhc , such as total cross - section , @xmath1 invariant mass distribution , and the number of additional jets in @xmath1 events . in order to carry out our analysis ,",
    "we have done a systematic scan in mass and coupling space for a broad class of models , described in appendix [ app : madgraph ] . for a subset of the models that give the best fit to the data we generate 5 million events , applying cuts and @xmath24 reconstruction mirroring the atlas analysis @xcite in order to compare to lhc @xmath25 distributions .",
    "many models will be strongly constrained by these analyses with just @xmath2 . in our earlier paper on searching for flavor - violating resonances at the lhc",
    ", we proposed top - jet resonances as a means to search for @xmath3-channel mediators @xcite .",
    "such a search is complementary to the analysis here .",
    "many @xmath3-channels models will be constrained by existing analyses , but the models that survive can have an imprint in top - jet resonances .    the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the classes of models that could generate the forward - backward asymmetry at the parton level , examining the asymmetries that are generated by the possible effective vertices , and drawing conclusions about which classes of models are viable .",
    "the reader who is interested only in the numerical results can skip this section , and move on to sec .",

    "( [ sec : lhc ] ) , we then examine the expected top properties at the lhc for the classes of models we consider . in the appendices , parton level asymmetries , as well as a detailed discussion of our analysis pipeline , can be found .",
    "broadly speaking , either @xmath17-channel or @xmath3- ( or @xmath23)-channel resonances can generate the top forward - backward asymmetries at tree level . we show the diagrams that contribute both to the tevatron @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at lhc in fig .",
    "[ phiproduction ] .",
    "the structure of the differential cross - section for models that produce the asymmetry through @xmath3-channel exchange of a top - flavor - carrying mediator takes the same basic form according to whether the mediator is spin-0 or spin-1 .",
    "let the effective lagrangian involving top and up quarks take the form [ eq : np lagrangian ] _",
    "=       where @xmath26 for singlets and octets and @xmath27 for anti - triplets and sextets , and @xmath28 are the color generators of a representation @xmath29@xmath30 hermitian matrices that contain clebsch - gordon coefficients connecting two ( anti-)quarks , normalized so that @xmath31 . for singlets , we take @xmath32 .",
    "note that we are restricting ourselves to couplings to top and up quarks , though our results should not qualitatively change given couplings to down - type quarks .",
    "we also only consider single mediator production ; double mediator production is only important for light colored states , which are not present for the models we consider .",
    "a large number of models of np can generate these effective vertices , involving , in addition to the color group , potentially @xmath33 and flavor representations .",
    "there are a limited number of flavor symmetric models that can generate the top @xmath0 in the @xmath3 channel while satisfying existing constraints .",
    "we show in table  [ quantumnumbers ] the possibilities .",
    "there are also interactions that connect @xmath34 to @xmath34 , but these models with flavor symmetries are typically highly constrained by light quark observables since they mix with sm ckm physics .",
    "we do not consider them further .",
    "interactions connecting , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath34 to @xmath35 through a spin-1 color triplet or sextet `` diquark '' are also possible , but as we will soon see ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : failures ] ) , the dominant @xmath3-channel interaction for top @xmath18 does not give rise to a significant positive asymmetry .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a complete tabulation in the scalar mediator case of the possible flavor symmetries and to @xcite for discussion of @xmath18 in the context of minimal flavor violation . in any case , the general observations that we make on the basis of the effective vertices in eq .",
    "( [ eq : np lagrangian ] ) will be relatively independent of the flavor representation , and we make the appropriate qualifications where necessary . for example , in flavor symmetric models , states in both the @xmath3 channel and the @xmath17 channel can contribute to the total asymmetry .",
    "scalars in the @xmath17 channel do nt contribute to the forward - backward asymmetry , but can have an impact through their interference with @xmath3-channel scalars that do generate the asymmetry .    .flavor symmetric interactions ( in schematic notation ) involving at least one @xmath35 quark that can mediate a significant positive top forward - backward asymmetry in the @xmath3-channel .",
    "( see also @xcite . ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we analyzed eight classes of models : c1v , c8v , f8c1v , c1s , c3s , schanc8v@xmath36 , schanc8va , schanc8vr , as discussed in the main body of text .",
    "we consider the @xmath1 pair production cross section at the lhc and tevatron , and @xmath0 at the tevatron as the test of different models .",
    "we generate events for the process @xmath1 + 0 or 1 jets with mlm matching .",
    "the renormalization group and factorization scales are fixed to be 200 gev , and the top quark mass is 172 gev .",
    "we employ cteq6l parton distribution functions .",
    "our analysis has been done in three steps : rough scan , fine scan and benchmark point analysis .",
    "for the rough and fine scans , we generate 100,000 ` madgraph ` events for each point , passing them through the ` pythia ` and ` pgs ` pipelines . at the stage of the fine scan ,",
    "we are able to see which models look most promising as shown in figs .",
    "( [ tev scatter scalar])-([tev scatter schan ] ) . for each benchmark model point , we generate five million ` madgraph ` events followed by ` pythia ` and ` pgs ` .",
    "note that the number of generated events is reduced by 20% - 40% due to the mlm matching procedure .",
    "we summarize the model points in table [ modelpointscan ] .",
    "although not a physics problem , generating event sets for a large number of model points is an intensive computing task with many engineering issues .",
    "the difficulty arises particularly with a cluster computing setup because it poses a new paradigm for software design .",
    "we share our experience in addressing such issues and suggest a common infrastructure .",
    "we utilize a cluster server named ` flux ` in the center for advanced computing at the university of michigan .",
    "ideally , the event generation software ` madgraph ` could handle the cluster server configuration seamlessly , but in practice it is not easily implementable .",
    "the major challenge is that the disk i / o speed of a shared file system is not fast enough for ` madgraph ` event generation .",
    "` madgraph ` creates a large number of small files , and the delay in writing to the shared file system causes the program to crash .",
    "a solution is found by making use of local storage ; in most modern cluster computers , each node is provided with its own ( fast ) local storage space . to utilize this",
    ", the desired workflow must be to send a job which installs ` madgraph ` on the temporary local disk space in the cluster node , followed by event generation tasks , uploading generated files , and finally erasing the temporary files .",
    "since parallel computing is , in some sense , highly nondeterministic ( on account of network latency or cluster usage traffic ) , jobs routinely fail .",
    "therefore , it is important to make a highly resilient system for reducing the burden of bookkeeping of failed jobs .",
    "we design each job as a smart agent program which autonomously tests and monitors its own progression status .",
    "this requires us to make a central server for controlling assignment and checking the status of each job by having each job client report its status and wait for a new assignment for the next job if failed or finished .",
    "many high energy physics programs contain legacy codes , and ` madgraph ` is no exception .",
    "due to incompatibilities or missing features , these codes often must be modified by users .",
    "however , quick - and - dirty code repairs usually increase the complexity of a system .",
    "to control this , we make wrapping modules for external programs which is under our version control . by making those modules easily installable ,",
    "the overall development becomes much simpler and easier in error control .",
    "we call this system ` pipeline ` which is essentially a set of installable high energy physics program modules .    for inter - process communication ,",
    "we choose a standard web service interface , since http protocols are not blocked in the usual firewall setup of a cluster . by standardizing the job specification interface and each computer configuration , one can achieve flexibility and extensibility in routine high energy physics jobs .",
    "the job queue server retains information for each task for future documentation , and also effectively dispatches jobs .",
    "the web service choice has been superior in making a good user interface and utilizing common available tools .",
    "( [ clustersetup ] ) shows our pipeline setup . we develop the system in haskell using glasgow haskell compiler ( ` ghc ` )",
    "the job queue server is supposed to be always on and waiting for new jobs or new job requests from the client , which can run either in a cluster or on common desktops .",
    "if it runs on a cluster , a bootstrap script called ` clusteregg ` automatically installs a ready - made setup for a job client with ` madgraph ` and the rest of the needed software .",
    "since each job client sends its configuration when it requests a new job , the job queue server dispatches a new job for which the client is adequate ( for example , if the job client does not have _ mathematica _ , then _",
    "mathematica _ jobs are not assigned ) .",
    "a client also rechecks whether a job is doable with its current setup , and finally both parties handshake on the job assignment . after the negotiation",
    ", the job client proceeds with the job according to the job specification from the server , and the job specification and high energy physics tools are interfaced with ` pipeline ` .",
    "after the job is finished , a job client sends its results to the storage server and wipes out the temporary files . every step of the job status",
    "is reported to the job queue server for monitoring purposes .",
    "we will announce details of the ` pipeline ` and ` jobqueue ` systems elsewhere soon .",
    "high performance computing facilities are now practically mandatory in high energy theory projects even for understanding the implication of the current state - of - the - art high energy experiments , especially in the lhc era .",
    "building a common computing software infrastructure adjusted to high energy physics will harness our physics community in a very positive way .",

    "<S> we carry out a comprehensive analysis of models for top @xmath0 at cdf in light of new top data arriving from the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we begin with a careful tevatron analysis , considering in general which sets of effective vertices give rise to a large forward - backward asymmetry while suppressing the contribution to the total @xmath1 cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> we show on general grounds that scalar models struggle to produce sufficient asymmetries consistent with cdf observations , while vector models can produce a large asymmetry with a less significant tension in the total cross - section and @xmath1 invariant mass distribution at the tevatron . we examine the essential observables of these models for top physics at lhc7 with @xmath2 of data , including the total cross - section , invariant mass distribution and number of additional jets in @xmath1 events . in the case of @xmath3-channel mediators , the lhc total cross - section places a strong constraint on light mediators , </S>",
    "<S> while the tevatron invariant mass distributions place strong constraints on heavy mediators that are able to produce the asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> heavy axigluons are becoming increasingly squeezed by lhc7 @xmath1 and dijet resonance searches . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that lhc7 top analyses are rapidly closing the window for viable models of the cdf top @xmath0 . </S>"
