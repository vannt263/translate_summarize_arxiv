    "the canis major overdensity was discovered by @xcite as an excess in the density of 2mass m - giant stars in the direction @xmath4 compared to similar fields in the northern galactic hemisphere .",
    "it is estimated to span @xmath5 sq.deg . on the sky and to be concentrated at a distance of @xmath6 kpc from the sun @xcite .",
    "the large numbers of m - giant and red clump ( rc ) stars in the cma overdensity suggest that its main population is of intermediate age @xmath7 gyr @xcite .",
    "a `` blue plume '' of stars in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) has been interpreted by @xcite and @xcite as the main - sequence of a younger population ( age @xmath8gyr )    the cma overdensity was interpreted by @xcite as the remnant core of a disrupting dwarf galaxy . however",
    ", its origin remains a topic of considerable debate .",
    "the dwarf galaxy hypothesis has been contested by several authors who , using different tracers and techniques , have proposed that the overdensity is produced by the stellar populations of the warped galactic thin disk @xcite , the thick disk @xcite , and the outer norma - cygnus spiral arm @xcite .",
    "counter arguments have been made by @xcite and @xcite , in support of the dwarf galaxy nature of cma , claiming that the galactic warp is not sufficient to account for the overdensity .",
    "the proper motions of a sample of blue plume stars have been measured by @xcite , who concluded that these stars do not have the space motions expected of galactic stars , if they have the same radial velocity as the sample of m - giants that @xcite attributed to the cma dwarf galaxy .",
    "the lack of consensus on this issue is probably a consequence of our limited knowledge of the complex galactic structure in this direction and also the large and highly variable interstellar extinction .",
    "cma lies in the third galactic quadrant where the warp of the thin disk has its maximum amplitude ( at @xmath9 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and where the galactic thick disk might be warped as well @xcite .",
    "also , in this quadrant the spiral arms have not been traced as well as in other directions @xcite .    in table",
    "[ t : cmastudies ] , we summarize the previous studies of the stellar populations in the cma overdensity .",
    "most are photometric and use techniques such as main sequence ( ms ) fitting and modelling of either hess diagrams ( hd ) or cmds to obtain the age , metallicity and distance for the stellar population of the cma overdensity . @xcite and @xcite have made use of multiband photometry and two color diagrams ( tcd ) to reduce the effects of reddening .",
    "the top part of the table shows the studies of the young population in the region , while the bottom part indicates the intermediate age ones .",
    "as one can see from the table , no old population ( @xmath3gyr ) has been identified .    in summary",
    ", there are two conflicting views of the nature of the cma overdensity :    * the cma overdensity is a dsph galaxy undergoing tidal disruption .",
    "the stellar population of this galaxy is dominated by an intermediate - age population , and there is a minority population of much younger stars @xcite . *",
    "the overdensity in the intermediate - age population is produced by a projection of the warped thin and thick disks @xcite into the line of sight .",
    "the young population corresponds to the outer part of the norma - cygnus spiral arm which , being part of the thin disk , also follows the warp @xcite .",
    "the goal of our work was to conduct a large scale survey of rr lyrae stars ( rrls ) in order to trace the oldest stellar population ( @xmath3gyr ) .",
    "old stellar populations containing rrls have been identified in every dsph satellite of the milky way ( mw ) and of m31 that has been properly surveyed ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the cma galaxy is similar to these systems in its stellar mix and has the proposed luminosity , a large excess ( @xmath10 ) of rrls is expected ( see  4 ) .",
    "because rrls are excellent standard candles , the distances to individual rrls can be obtained with high precision ( @xmath11 ) . if there is a dsph galaxy at a distance of @xmath6 kpc @xcite , an overdensity of rrls",
    "is expected at magnitudes @xmath12 .",
    "the detection of an overdensity of rrls that spans a narrow range of magnitudes would be conclusive proof that a dsph galaxy produces the cma overdensity .",
    "on the other hand , the absence of an excess of rrls would weaken the dwarf galaxy hypothesis , leaving more likely a galactic origin for the cma overdensity .",
    "the large field of view ( @xmath13 ) provided by the quest - i camera @xcite , installed on the 1 m jurgen stock telescope at the venezuelan national observatory of llano del hato , made this an ideal instrument to conduct a large - scale , multi - epoch survey of an extended structure such as the cma overdensity .",
    "the observations were made in the v band and were obtained in two runs during 2004 and 2005 , centered at @xmath14 and spanning @xmath15 sq .",
    "degrees with an effective coverage of @xmath0sq .",
    "( which takes into account the area missed because of the gaps between the ccds in the mosaic camera and the saturation of very bright stars ) . on average , we obtained @xmath16 epochs per field in @xmath17 nights , with a time spacing between consecutive observations ranging from a few hours up to several weeks .",
    "infrared j , h and k magnitudes from the 2mass catalogue were also obtained for each star .",
    "the area covered by our survey and previous studies is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : regionmaps ] , where a schematic diagram is overlaid on an extinction map derived from the @xcite dust maps .",
    "the cma feature spans @xmath5 sq .",
    "deg . and has a smoothly varying density across the plane of the sky , which according to @xcite can be fitted with gaussian profiles .",
    "the axes of the ellipse shown in fig.[f : regionmaps ] correspond to the full - width at half maxima ( fwhm ) derived for cma using the aspect ratio of @xmath18 and the fwhm in the latitude direction measured by @xcite . assuming a gaussian profile with these fwhm we computed that @xmath19 of the stars in cma overdensity should be present in our survey s footprint .",
    "the percentage could be smaller than this because @xcite considered @xmath20 to be a lower limit of the aspect ratio . from fig .",
    "6 of @xcite , we estimate that the aspect ratio is probably not much larger than @xmath21 , and consequently , that our survey s coverage is @xmath22 . in the following discussion",
    ", we adopt @xmath23 to be conservative . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : regionmaps ] , our survey includes the same central regions where others ( e.g. , martinez - delgado et al . 2005 ; bellazzini et al.2006 ; butler et al .",
    "2007 ) have detected large overdensities of stars .",
    "one can also see that the extinction is highly variable in the vicinity of cma and that its main body is located in a low extinction window , as noted by @xcite .",
    "the image frames were reduced using standard _ _ iraf _ _ routines for bias subtraction and flat - fielding . due to the low galactic latitude of the surveyed region ,",
    "the fields are highly crowded , thus requiring the computation of magnitudes through psf photometry .",
    "the psf photometry was obtained using _ daophot _ tasks with a model psf spatially variable to second order , constructed from @xmath24 stars per image .",
    "the astrometric solution was computed for each image using the program cm1 @xcite , which calculates the astrometric matrix based on the coordinates of @xmath25 catalogue stars per image , identified from the usnob1.0 catalogue @xcite .",
    "the precision of the obtained astrometric solutions was @xmath26 , which was calculated by matching the coordinates of all objects with the 2mass point source catalogue , and corresponds to the mean difference between the cm1 and the 2mass coordinates for each object .",
    "this precision is sufficient for identifying each star in the different observations .",
    "the photometric calibration was made in two steps , the normalization of the instrumental magnitudes with respect to a reference night , and the calibration of the reference night photometry using secondary photometric standards .    in the first step ,",
    "the magnitude zero - point of each night with respect to the reference night was obtained by calculating a 3-sigma clipped mean of the magnitude differences of the stars that were detected on both nights .",
    "the use of @xmath27 stars in the calculations made these zero - points statistically robust .",
    "the obtained zero - point was then added to the instrumental magnitudes of all the objects observed on that particular night . at the completion of this process ,",
    "mean photometric errors were evaluated as a function of magnitude by calculating the standard deviation of the multi - epoch observations of each object . a typical plot of standard deviation @xmath28 of psf magnitudes as a function of the mean magnitude is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : e_vs_mag ] .    for the second step ,",
    "observations of the secondary standard fields were made with the 1.3 m telescope of the smarts consortium at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) , chile , with the @xmath29 pixel fairchild 447 ccd camera , which has a field of view of @xmath30 .",
    "the observations were made in the r and v filters on 2004 january 23 , under photometric conditions .",
    "a field containing landolt standards was also observed during the night at different airmasses .",
    "the photometric solution for the night was applied to the objects detected in the secondary standard fields .",
    "the @xmath31 stars that were selected as secondary standards have photometry in both filters and photometric errors @xmath32 magnitudes .",
    "the secondary standards fields were chosen to be centered on open clusters lying in the region , to ensure having blue stars among the secondary standards .",
    "consequently , the color distribution of the @xmath31 secondary standards was quite broad , @xmath33 .",
    "each row of ccds in the quest camera was calibrated independently .",
    "the mean _ rms _ of the calculated solutions is @xmath34 magnitudes .",
    "the limiting magnitude obtained is @xmath35 , defined as the typical magnitude of objects with @xmath36 mag .",
    "the completeness magnitude obtained is @xmath37 , which corresponds to the mode of the magnitude distribution of all objects .",
    "finally , the saturation magnitude of the survey is @xmath38 .",
    "the heliocentric distance range explored by our rrls survey is therefore @xmath39 kpc @xmath40 kpc ( for the complete sample and assuming @xmath41 ) , which clearly includes the distance range of the cma overdensity ( @xmath42 kpc @xmath43 kpc , see table [ t : cmastudies ] ) .",
    "finally , the extinction correction was performed on a star by star basis , since extinction is highly variable in the surveyed region ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : regionmaps ] ) due to its proximity to the galactic plane .",
    "this was done by subtracting the corresponding @xmath44 at the position of each star , computed from a linear interpolation of the @xcite dust maps , and including the asymptotic correction proposed by @xcite .",
    "the first step in the rrls search was the identification of stars showing photometric variability in the v magnitude , using the procedure explained in @xcite .",
    "this consisted of computing , via a @xmath45 test , the probability of the v magnitude dispersion being solely due to the photometric errors . from the catalogue of @xmath46 stars , @xmath47 stars had @xmath48 which indicates that they have a probability of @xmath49 of being variable .",
    "the rrls search was further restricted to the @xmath50 variable candidates fulfilling the following criteria : ( i ) intrinsic color indices @xmath51 consistent with those of spectral types earlier than g0 .",
    "( ii ) observed amplitude @xmath52 , and ( iii ) number of observations in the v filter , @xmath53 .",
    "the rrls search followed the procedure devised by @xcite for fitting the light curves of rrls .",
    "this consisted of fitting light - curve templates while varying four parameters : period , amplitude , phase offset and magnitude at maximum light . for the fits of rr__ab",
    "_ _ variables , we used the six templates made by @xcite , which cover the range of light - curve shapes of this type of star . for rr__c",
    "_ _ stars , we used either a cosine curve or a template made by averaging and smoothing the light curves of 10 well - observed rr_c _ stars from the quest rr lyrae catalogue @xcite .",
    "the ranges for the trial parameters were explored according to the known distribution of periods and amplitudes for rrls of each type @xcite , using a step of @xmath54 d for the period in the range @xmath55 d for rr@xmath56 and @xmath57 d for rr@xmath58 ; a step of @xmath59 mag for the amplitude in the ranges @xmath60 mag for rr@xmath56 and @xmath61 for rr@xmath58 ; and steps of @xmath59 mag and @xmath62 for the v magnitude at maximum light and the phase offset respectively .",
    "these values were then taken as the uncertainties of the corresponding parameters .",
    "for each set of trial parameters , the @xmath45 of the fit was computed and finally , the four best fits for each rrls type were visually inspected for every star .",
    "the stars for which an adequate template fit was found were selected as initial rrls candidates .",
    "additionally , the epoch at maximum light and the flux - averaged v magnitude @xmath63 were calculated using the best fitting light - curve parameters .",
    "the observations with the stock telescope yielded for some rrls candidates poorly sampled light curves .",
    "consequently , we obtained additional observations with the @xmath64 m , @xmath65 m and @xmath66 m telescopes of the smarts consortium at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) , during sept - oct 2004 and jan - feb 2008 ; and with the 1.0 m reflector at the national observatory of venezuela ( nov ) , during jan 2008 .",
    "all observations were made in the v filter .",
    "this photometry was normalized to the reference night of the quest photometry using @xmath67 field stars per image for the ctio observations and @xmath68 for the nov observations . on average ,",
    "@xmath42 additional epochs were obtained for each candidate rrls , yielding an average @xmath17 observations per star .",
    "light curve parameters were recalculated with the additional observations , including exploration of period aliases . with these additional observations , only @xmath69 stars passed our tests for rrls candidates , @xmath70 of type @xmath58 and @xmath71 of type ab .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of the 14 brighther ( @xmath72 , equivalent to @xmath73 kpc ) rrls was conducted in order to obtain radial velocities and metallicities .",
    "these bright stars lie within the distance range of the cma overdensity .",
    "spectra were obtained with the cassegrein spectrograph at the 1.5 m smarts telescope in cerro tololo interamerican observatory , chile .",
    "the observations were obtained in service mode in the months 2004 november - december , 2005 january , and 2008 february .",
    "the instrumental setup was the same used by our group to observe a large number of halo rrls from the quest survey .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details on the instrumental setup , data reduction , and methods to estimate radial velocities and metallicities . here",
    "we will summarize only the more important issues .",
    "the spectra have a resolution of 4.3  and a spectral range from 3500 to 5300  .",
    "radial velocities were obtained by fourier cross - correlation ( iraf s _ fxcor _ task ) with several radial velocity standards of the same spectral type .",
    "the radial velocity standards were chosen from the list of @xcite which also serve as pseudo - equivalent width standards for estimating the metallicities .",
    "each rrls was observed twice at different phases during the pulsation cycle . to obtain the systemic velocity , @xmath74 , of each star , the radial velocity curve of the well - studied star x arietis was fitted to the data ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicities were estimated using the calibration by @xcite of the pseudo - equivalent width of the ca ii k line ( w(k ) ) , corrected for interstellar absorption , and the mean pseudo - equivalent widths of the @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 balmer lines ( w(h ) ) .",
    "the estimated error of the [ fe / h ] measurements , which are on the @xcite metallicity scale , is 0.15 dex for the rr@xmath56 and 0.20 dex for the rr@xmath58 .",
    "our sample is expected to be contaminated by other types of variable stars . in order of decreasing likelihood ,",
    "these are contact eclipsing binaries ( w uma stars ) of a - f spectral type , pulsating blue straggler stars of the delta scuti and sx phoenicis types , and cepheids of type ii and of the anomalous classification .    in many cases",
    "the light curves of w uma stars resemble a cosine curve @xcite , making it difficult to distinguish them photometrically from rr@xmath58 stars , since their period ranges also overlap .",
    "however , several orbital configurations do have light curves that can be distinguished , and consequently , we also fitted a w uma templates to some of the candidate rr@xmath58 stars .",
    "this template was constructed from the fourier coefficientes of @xcite ( @xmath78,@xmath79,@xmath80 ) , following @xcite .",
    "we used only this w uma template , which we consider representative of the type , since our goal was only to reduce the contamination that these stars introduce in the rr@xmath58 sample , and not to survey their properties .",
    "the w uma template yielded a better fit than the rr@xmath58 template for @xmath39 stars , namely 25711 , 10651 and 18056 .",
    "the radial velocities of these stars are also consistent with the interpretation that these stars are not rrls .",
    "the radial velocities of stars 25711 and 10651 appear to be constant , while for star 18056 the radial velocity curve template for rrc stars does not fit the observations properly .",
    "furthermore , the mean velocities of these 3 stars are @xmath81 @xmath82 , @xmath83 @xmath82and @xmath84 @xmath82 , respectively , which lie close to the radial velocity peak expected for thin disk stars , which for the survey region is @xmath85 @xmath82 with @xmath86 @xmath82 ( see  [ s : radvel ] ) . we conclude that stars 25711 , 10651 and 18056 are most likely eclipsing binaries from the thin disk , and have classified them as w uma stars .    in the selection of rrls candidates , we imposed color cuts to exclude the numerous red variables in the fields , but some non - rrls may pass these criteria .",
    "our spectroscopy revealed that the rr@xmath58 candidates 6460 , 5564 , and 17237 have late f spectral types .",
    "since these types are too late for rr@xmath58 stars ( smith 1995 ) , we have removed them from the sample of candidate rrls .",
    "the delta scuti and sx phoenicis variables , also known as dwarf cepheids , have spectral types a0-f5 iii - v , v amplitudes @xmath87 mag and periods in the ranges @xmath88 d and @xmath89 d respectively .",
    "consequently , the period range of delta scuti stars overlaps with the short period end of the rr@xmath58 period distribution @xcite . in the case of sx phoenicis stars",
    ", it is expected that some stars will have period aliases within the range expected for rr@xmath58 stars , which may escape detection by the low number of epochs and the time spacing of our observations .",
    "although much less numerous than eclipsing binaries , delta scuti and sx phoenicis stars are expected in the galactic disk and halo respectively , and hence are possible contaminants of the rr@xmath58 sample .    finally ,",
    "a possible contaminant of the rr@xmath56 sample are anomalous cepheids and short period type ii cepheids , also known as bl herculis and w virginis stars @xcite .",
    "these stars have light curve shapes and period ranges that partially overlap with rrls stars .",
    "however , these stars are very rare in comparison to the rrls in the halo population , which is the only mw population in which they have been found .",
    "given that the halo population is itself a small contributor to the stellar density in the cma fields ( see  5 ) , the contamination from these stars should be small compared to the other types of stars .",
    "after the removal of the likely contaminants , @xmath70 stars remained in our sample of rrls candidates .",
    "the light curves for the @xmath70 rrls are shown in figure [ f : rrlcs ] , and those of the @xmath39 w uma stars are shown in figure [ f : wuma_lcs ] .",
    "the light curve and physical parameters obtained for the @xmath70 rrls in table [ t : rrpars ] , including heliocentric distances of rrls calculated based on the flux - averaged mean magnitude @xmath90 and assuming @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the distance to the rrls has been estimated in 7% , following @xcite .",
    "the light curve parameters of the rejected rrls candidates are summarized in table [ t : rejpars ] .",
    "we must caution , however , that some contamination by non - rrls may be still present , particularly for the sample of rr@xmath58 stars .",
    "the survey s completeness was evaluated as the fraction of synthetically generated light curves for which the period was succesfully recovered .",
    "a total of @xmath92 synthetic rrls light curves were generated for both rr@xmath56 and rr@xmath58 types , with @xmath70 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 data points and a time sampling characteristic of the survey .",
    "typical random photometric errors were added as a function of magnitude ( fig . [",
    "f : e_vs_mag ] ) .",
    "the synthetic light curves were used as input for the rrls identification algorithm described in  [ s : rrlsearch ] . if for a synthetic light curve , the difference between the real and the best fitting period was better than @xmath95 , it was considered as recovered .",
    "the percentage of recovered light curves as a function of magnitude for types rr@xmath56 and rr@xmath58 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : comp ] . for this plot",
    ", we averaged the results obtained for light curves with different numbers of data points .",
    "one can see from this figure that the average completeness of the survey is @xmath96 .",
    "rrls 26896 has been previously identified as an rrls by the all sky automated survey ( asas-3 , * ? ? ?",
    "the period derived for this star in the asas-3 survey ( @xmath97 ) coincides with our best - fitting period ( see table [ t : rrpars ] ) .",
    "the asas v - filter observations are systematically brighter than ours , but this is due to a bright neighbor ( @xmath98 ) of star rrls 26896 , lying at a distance of @xmath99 , which is unresolved in the asas survey .",
    "this is the only rrls from the gcvs or the asas-3 that lies in the surveyed region , and it was successfully recovered by our survey .",
    "rrls are found in the halo and thick disk stellar populations of the mw , and a certain number of them are expected in the region that we have surveyed . below we estimate the numbers of these stars and their distributions in space and radial velocity to see if there is an excess of rrls that should be attributed to another source .",
    "since the volume of our survey is naturally expressed in heliocentric galactic coordinates @xmath100 , the number @xmath101 of rrls in a given volume is expressed as    @xmath102    this equation requires that the density profile @xmath103 be expressed in terms of heliocentric coordinates .",
    "since the density profiles of the halo and thick disk are naturally written in galactocentric coordinates , the coordinate transformation complicates the integral in eq.[nrr ] , making extremely difficult to obtain an analytical solution .",
    "consequently , we solved it numerically by using a monte carlo implementation of the von neumann rejection technique @xcite .",
    "the rrls density profile of the galactic halo has been well constrained by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of the galactic thick disk ,",
    "the rrls density profile has only been characterized in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk @xcite , which is due to the difficulties in surveying the crowded fields near the galactic plane where the interstellar extinction is high .",
    "the density profile of the thick disk has been studied by several authors using different tracers and techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we have adopted these profiles as valid for the rrls too .",
    "the assumed analytical expressions for the density profiles of the galactic halo and thick disk are listed in table [ t : densprof ] . in table",
    "[ t : densprof ] , we also give the density profile of a hypothetically warped thick disk with the same warp properties as the thin disk .",
    "this profile is used in order to explore the possibility that the thick disk might be warped , as suggested by @xcite . since",
    "the possible warp of the thick disk has not been explored in detail , the best assumption we can make is that it is described by the same parameters as the warp of the thin disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is a plausible assumption since analytical models of warp formation @xcite and n - body simulations , which model the formation of warped thin and thick disks @xcite predict similar properties .",
    "the profile parameters , namely the rrls density normalization @xmath104 ( for type ab rrls ) , the power - law index @xmath105 and flattening ratio @xmath106 of the halo , as well as the scale length @xmath107 and scale height @xmath108 of the thick disk , determined by several authors using different tracers are presented in table [ t : profpars ] .",
    "since the only determination available to date of @xmath104 for the thick disk is that of @xcite , derived from nearby rrls , we use this value ( @xmath109 rrls@xmath110 ) in the calculation of @xmath101 using the scale lengths and heights derived by different authors ( table [ t : profpars ] ) .    by solving eq .",
    "[ nrr ] using the profiles given in table [ t : densprof ] , we obtained the total number of rrls expected in the range @xmath111 .",
    "the results are shown in the last column of table [ t : profpars ] , in which @xmath101 has been computed for rrls of both types by correcting for the factor @xmath112 @xcite to account for rrls of type c. also , we derived the number of rrls as a function of heliocentric distance , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : nrrprofile ] together with the observed radial distribution of rrls in our survey . from fig .",
    "[ f : nrrprofile ] , one can see that the theoretical rrls radial distribution changes only slightly with the different sets of parameters .",
    "most importantly , in the case of the warped thick disk there is a peak located at @xmath113 kpc , independent of the choice of the parameter set .",
    "this peak corresponds to the distance where the survey s line of sight intersects the highest density part of the thick disk s warp .",
    "the existence of this peak in the case of a warped disk is what led @xcite and others @xcite to contest the interpretation of the cma overdensity as a dwarf galaxy remnant , suggesting instead that it could be due to the warped galactic disk(s ) .    from table",
    "[ t : profpars ] , one can see that @xmath114 halo rrls are expected in the distance range of the survey , and @xmath115 or @xmath116 rrls are expected respectively from a normal or warped thick disk .",
    "this yields a total of @xmath117 or @xmath118 rrls expected from a galactic distribution .",
    "these numbers are in excellent agreement with the @xmath70 rrls found in our survey , leaving very little room ( if any ) for an excess of rrls over the galactic background .",
    "to take into account the random fluctuations that are obviously present in such small samples , we made @xmath119 random realizations of a halo plus a normal thick disk ( h+td ) and of a halo plus a warped thick disk ( h+wtd ) .",
    "each of these realizations was compared with the observed radial distribution , and the probabilities that the distributions are different were computed via a kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "these tests showed that for the h+td and h+wtd distributions only @xmath120 and @xmath95 , respectively , of the @xmath119 realizations were incompatible with the observed distribution ( i.e. @xmath121 ) .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the observed rrls radial distribution is consistent with the expectations from the galactic models , although the small number of stars hinders any distinction between a normal and a warped thick disk .",
    "several studies have shown that there is a correlation between the [ fe / h ] values of rrls and their memberships in the stellar populations of the mw .",
    "@xcite , for example , found that the majority of rrls with [ fe / h]@xmath122 and [ fe / h]@xmath123 are members of the halo and thick disk populations , respectively , while the intermediate zone , @xmath124[fe / h]@xmath125 , is occupied by a mixture of these populations . according to these limits ,",
    "the probable memberships of the 8 rrls in our sample that have [ fe / h ] measurements are 4 halo stars , 1 thick disk star , and @xmath39 in the mixture zone .",
    "while these assignments must be viewed with caution because the [ fe / h ] distributions of both populations have tails that extend beyond the region of large overlap , they are consistent with the results obtained from the density profiles .      as discussed above , we have measured the radial velocities of the 8 rrls that lie in the distance range of the cma overdensity ( @xmath126 kpc ) . in the upper diagram of fig.[f : radvel ] , the radial velocity distributions of the rrab and rrc variables are depicted by the clear and the shaded histograms , respectively .",

    "we can also firmly reject the possibility that the luminosity of this galaxy has been simply overestimated .",

    "[ f : nrr_mv ] shows that the dsph galaxy that deviates by the largest amount below the line is the mw satellite leo i. this was long considered to be an example of a galaxy whose stellar population is completely dominated by an intermediate - age population because there was no clear - cut evidence for an older population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the recent survey by @xcite , which discovered 74 rrls in leo i , showed that even this exceptional system has an old stellar population containing rrls .",

    "if a dsph galaxy of @xmath154 produces the cma overdensity , the results of our survey suggest that it has @xmath155 , an order of magnitude smaller than that of leo i.",
    "the quest rr lyrae survey in the cma overdensity has yielded the following results :    * ten rrls , @xmath71 of type @xmath56 and @xmath156 of type @xmath58 , were found by our survey , which spans @xmath157 sq .",

    "integration of the density profiles of the galactic halo and thick disk indicates that within the surveyed region the galactic halo and thick disk should contribute a total of @xmath117 rrls , and if the thick disk is warped like the thin disk , the expected number is @xmath118 rrls .",
    "these numbers are in good agreement with the @xmath70 rrls found by our survey ; consequently there is no excess of rrls in the cma overdensity . *",
    "the radial velocities of 8 out of the 10 rrls were measured , and their values are consistent with membership in either the galactic halo or the thick disk populations . *",
    "an analysis of the number of rrls found in the dsph satellites of the mw and m31 indicates that our survey should have discovered @xmath162 rrls if the cma overdensity is produced by a typical dsph galaxy with @xmath163 , the estimated luminosity of the cma system .",
    "even if this galaxy is 2.5 magnitudes fainter , which is much lower than any estimate in the literature , the expected excess of rrls is @xmath164 , which is not observed .",
    "the cma dsph galaxy must have a significantly lower value of the specific frequency of rrls ( @xmath152 ) than leo i , the local group dsph that has the lowest measured value .    the hypothesis that the cma overdensity is produced by a dwarf galaxy is severely constrained by the above results .",
    "we have shown that if it is a dsph galaxy , the type favored by the proponents of the hypothesis , then it must be unlike any of the satellite dsph galaxies of the mw and m31 .",
    "no one has proposed that the putative galaxy is a dwarf irregular because there is no sign of a very young stellar population ( age @xmath165 myr , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or star forming regions associated with the cma overdensity .",
    "nonetheless , we note that rrls have been found in every dwarf irregular galaxy of the local group that has been adequately searched , and that there is evidence for very old and metal - poor stellar populations in the others ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these populations have probably produced rrls that await detection .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the old stars in the cmd of the cma overdensity have a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath166 and ages in the range 3 - 6 gyrs , although they could not constrain the presence of an older population . clearly",
    ", the metals in this intermediate - age population must have come from earlier generations of more metal poor stars .",
    "there is no sign of a blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) in the cmd , and our survey has shown that there are very few , if any , horizontal branch stars in the instability strip .",
    "the remaining alternative is that the majority of the oldest and most metal poor hb stars of the cma galaxy must lie on the red side of the instability strip and are therefore part of the red clump that is observed in the cmd .",
    "however , at low metallicities ( i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath167 ) a relatively young age is required to keep the horizontal branch to red side of the instability strip ( see , for example , fig .",
    "@xmath168 in * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the cma dwarf must have started its star formation at a later time than is observed in other dwarf galaxies .",
    "this was once thought to be the case for leo i , but we now know that this was incorrect @xcite .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the globular clusters ngc 1851 , 1904 , 2298 , and 2808 once belonged to the cma dwarf galaxy .",
    "these clusters span a range in horizontal branch type from predominantly blue to predominantly red , although each one contains many bhb stars and at least a few rrls @xcite .",
    "the idea that they originated in the cma dwarf is hard to reconcile with the lack of a bhb in the cma cmd and our result that there is no excess of rrls in the cma overdensity . in other dwarf galaxies that have globular cluster systems ( e.g. , the sgr and fornax dsph galaxies ) ,",
    "there are stellar populations in the main body that resemble the ones in the retinues of globular clusters .    in summary",
    ", the dwarf galaxy explanation for the cma overdensity requires that the system be unique among dsph galaxies , and perhaps also dwarf irregulars , in its low production of rrls .",
    "the absence of rrls in the overdensity is consistent with the alternative viewpoint that a combination of the thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the mw produces the cma overdensity @xcite .",
