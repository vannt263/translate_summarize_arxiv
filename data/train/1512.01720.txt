    "people working in enumerative combinatorics often encounter identities involving hypergeometric series ( or more generally , special functions ) . on one hand",
    ", the theory of hypergeometric series serves as a tool for solving combinatorial problems , and on the other hand , combinatorial models can be used to prove or explain hypergeometric series identities .",
    "this phenomenon similarly also applies to other areas , such as algebra and geometry , or mathematics and physics .",
    "problems which lay in the interface of two or more areas are often challenging and particularly interesting .",
    "the development of tools which combine two different areas is promising and may ultimately lead to a better understanding of both respective theories .",
    "now , just as in many classical instances where hypergeometric series emerge from problems in enumerative combinatorics , @xmath0-hypergeometric or basic hypergeometric series frequently emerge from problems in enumerative combinatorics involving some @xmath0-statistics ( which is a refined counting ) . on the contrary , given specific basic hypergeometric series identities , one can ask for suitable models where a combinatorial explanation can be provided .",
    "now this is not the end of the story .",
    "there is in fact a natural hierarchy of hypergeometric series : _ rational _",
    "( i.e. `` ordinary '' ) , _ trigonometric _ ( or `` @xmath0 '' , i.e. , `` basic '' ) , and _ elliptic _ ( or `` @xmath12 '' , balanced and well - poised ) hypergeometric series .",
    "not such a long time ago , people working in hypergeometric series have realized that the following three term relation of theta functions , @xmath13 ( see section  [ sec : ellan ] for the notation ) , can be used as a key relation to build up a theory of identities for series involving theta functions ( see @xcite and the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  11 ) ) , analogous to the classical theories of hypergeometric and of basic hypergeometric series .",
    "this can be compared to the hierarchy of meromorphic solutions of the yang ",
    "baxter equation , being rational , trigonometric , or elliptic , described in @xcite .",
    "( whereas trigonometric functions are periodic , elliptic functions are doubly periodic .",
    "this can not be pushed further , since by liouville s theorem , meromorphic functions on @xmath14 with three independent periods are constant . ) in the last three decades the theory of theta and elliptic hypergeometric functions has been developed to a great extent from various points of view ( including integrable systems , special functions , and biorthogonal functions ) . but",
    "despite of their original appearance in lattice models in statistical mechanics @xcite , elliptic hypergeometric series have not been studied much yet from a combinatorial point of view . in @xcite , one of us",
    "enumerated lattice paths with respect to suitable elliptic weight functions .",
    "this led to a combinatorial proof of the frenkel ",
    "turaev @xmath15 summation formula , a fundamental identity in the theory of elliptic hypergeometric series .",
    "further results from @xcite included the closed form elliptic enumeration of nonintersecting lattice paths .",
    "similar elliptic weights have also subsequently been used in @xcite and in @xcite to enumerate dimers and lozenge tilings . in the quest of trying to better understand the connection between combinatorics and elliptic hypergeometric series it is just natural to look for suitable general combinatorial models where",
    "elliptic weights can be utilized .",
    "the goal is to obtain explicit results that generalize the existing ones to the elliptic level , but which are still `` attractive '' ( such as results involving closed form products ) .",
    "although we were successful in our aim to extend the classical rook theory to the elliptic setting , we were somehow disappointed to find that elliptic hypergeometric series summations did not come out in this study .",
    "( see the discussion in subsection  [ subsecehs ] . )",
    "this is probably inherent to the model .",
    "already in the well - studied @xmath0-case the only basic hypergeometric series identities that arise in rook theory are those of karlsson  minton type ( see @xcite , and again subsection  [ subsecehs ] )",
    ". nevertheless , we are able for the first time to present a bunch of elliptic extensions of special numbers ( stirling , lah , etc . ) . as these are new ( and this territory opens up a new theory , namely of _ elliptic special numbers _ ) , we have put quite some attention to them in our exposition . a reader who is not so much interested in all of these new special numbers ,",
    "is advised to mainly focus on the material leading to the main result of this paper , the product formula in theorem  [ thm : elptprod ] and to look at one or two specific examples of applications . besides that",
    ", a reading of section  [ sec : fp ] in the end also serves to give an idea about the `` big story '' .",
