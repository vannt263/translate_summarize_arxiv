    "collisionless shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysical environments , such as gamma - ray bursts , active galactic nuclei or pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "they are especially important in the context of cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "once the shock is in a quasi - steady state , the jump conditions can be determined from the conservation of mass , energy and momentum in a fluid model @xcite . the density jump from the upstream to the downstream of a relativistic strong shock",
    "is given in 2d by @xmath1 .",
    "plasma instabilities are the mediators of such collisionless shocks @xcite , but it is still not known precisely how the transition from the initial plasma turbulence to the final quasi - steady state of the shock happens .    in a symmetric counter - streaming flow of charged particles ,",
    "plasma instabilities develop , causing an isotropisation of the particle momenta and initiating the deceleration of the plasma flows .",
    "in relativistic , cold and initially unmagnetised plasmas , electromagnetic current filamentation modes are dominant which inhabit a strong perpendicular component @xcite .",
    "the energy is transferred from an initial longitudinal streaming into the perpendicular directions .",
    "the particle forward motion is slowed - down and a collisionless shock starts to form with a density ratio of @xmath2 .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations are an excellent tool to investigate the shock formation process , since non - linear processes are involved @xcite . in a previous study",
    ", we identified the shock formation time of electron - positron pair shocks as twice the saturation time of the magnetic field amplification due to the filamentation instability , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , electron - ion shocks do not show the same feature as one would expect from the rapid relativistic mass increase of the electrons .",
    "our analysis shows a shock formation time @xmath4 .",
    "however , a similarity between both scenarios was observed : the steady state shock is formed when the first ions start to recirculate .",
    "the non - linear phase is faster in pair shocks and no additional time is necessary for the merging of magnetic flux tubes , so that the recirculation process starts earlier . as a consequence",
    ", particles are mainly scattered in the turbulence rather than doing a full gyro rotation , which is why the isotropisation process is less effective .",
    "we present a detailed theory for the shock formation in electron - ion plasmas , and compare it to state - of - the - art pic simulations .",
    "we consider a simple scenario for shock formation with the plasma initially being unmagnetised and symmetric counterstreaming relativistic beams of electrons and ions of mass ratio @xmath5 and lorentz factor @xmath6 .",
    "we refer to pair shocks of electrons and positrons when @xmath7 .",
    "the beams are initially cold , characterised by the temperature parameter @xmath8 , where the mass @xmath9 and temperature @xmath10 refer to the respective species .",
    "such scenarios are a stimulating environment for the current filamentation instability @xcite to occur .",
    "the growth rate of the cold current filamentation instability , for electron beams as well as for ion beams , is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the normalised fluid velocity of the beam and the plasma frequency is given by @xmath13 with the initial uniform beam density @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "let us start describing the mechanisms at work that lead to shock formation , before we turn to the analytical evaluation of the shock formation time .",
    "as already highlighted by various authors @xcite , the electron weibel instability is first triggered when the two plasmas start overlapping . by the time it saturates ,",
    "it has generated filaments of the size of the electron larmor radius in the field at saturation @xcite . at the time the ion weibel instability starts to grow , an unstable wavelength has already been seeded .",
    "it corresponds precisely to the one that has resulted from the merging of the filaments associated with the electron weibel instability with a typical length scale of @xmath15 . as a consequence , by the time the ion weibel instability saturates , the field is near equipartition with the ions , but",
    "the filaments are still the size of the _ electronic _ larmor radius , not the ions one , since the instability on the ions was initially seeded at these length scales .",
    "such filaments are too small to efficiently deflect the ion flow , and need to merge in order to reach required size @xcite .",
    "once the appropriate number of merging events has been achieved , the filaments reach the size of the ion larmor radius .",
    "only then is the ion flow deflected enough for the shock to start forming . assuming this happens at a time @xmath16 and following the reasoning explained in @xcite , the shock formation time will be @xmath17 in 2d , and @xmath18 in 3d .",
    "the electron weibel instability grows first , amplifying the field from its fluctuation value up to nearly equipartition with the electrons @xcite .",
    "the saturation time is here given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of e - foldings of the instability and @xmath21 its growth rate . by this time",
    ", the field has grown to nearly equipartition with @xcite @xmath22 from the cyclotron frequency @xmath23 , we derive the size of the filaments at saturation , which is also the electronic larmor radius in @xmath24 ( we set @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 a full quantitative understanding of the saturation magnetic field is still lacking and will be explored elsewhere @xcite .",
    "contrary to the electron current filamentation instability , which has to amplify the plasma thermal fluctuations , the ion weibel instability finds an unstable mode already seeded , and further amplifies it , growing preferentially at that wavenumber .",
    "this is clear from the fact that the growth rate of the ion weibel instability depends slowly on @xmath27 for wavenumbers @xmath28^{-3/2}$ ] @xcite . at saturation",
    ", the ion weibel instability has grown the field to @xmath29 while the size of the filaments is still given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : le ] ) .",
    "the growth time of the ion phase of the instability is @xmath30 the total duration of this saturation phase is @xmath31 , that with @xmath32 we obtain @xmath33 considering a number of e - foldings @xmath34 , we find that even for an artificially low mass ratio of 100 the term @xmath35 . as a consequence",
    ", the duration of the whole saturation phase simply reads @xmath36 . in reality , the ion growth rate @xmath37 is lower than @xmath38 , the growth rate of the cold ion current filamentation instability , because it grows over a background of hot electrons . yet , the consequences are negligible , see section [ sec : sftime ] .",
    "the dynamics of the merging of the filaments has been studied previously in @xcite who considered a simple 2d model of infinitely long cylindrical filaments of radius @xmath39 , spaced by the distance @xmath40 , found in @xcite , by @xmath41 . ] .",
    "the filaments need to merge @xmath42 times in order to grow from the electronic larmor radius ( [ eq : le ] ) to the ionic one . according to @xcite ,",
    "the expression for the merging time is different whether the transverse motion is relativistic or not ( merging of the filaments implies a motion transverse to the flow ) . at any rate , the maximum transverse velocity achieved during one merging reads @xcite @xmath43 considering @xmath44 .",
    "we now compare this velocity to @xmath45 . for the merging motion to be non - relativistic",
    ", we would need , @xmath46 if this condition is fulfilled at the end of the merging phase , then it is always fulfilled , since filaments are growing with time . replacing therefore @xmath40 by the ion larmor radius @xmath47",
    ", we find the condition above is always satisfied .    for the regime of",
    "non - relativistic transverse merging , @xcite established that all merging events are taking approximately the same time @xmath48 this number now has to be multiplied by the total number @xmath42 of merging events .",
    "since the initial and final filaments size are the electrons and ions larmor radii respectively , @xmath42 is given by @xcite , @xmath49 the total duration of the merging phase is therefore given by @xmath50      we can now proceed to the calculation of the full shock formation time .",
    "as soon as the filaments are large enough , the ions are efficiently deflected by the field over a distance close to the ion larmor radius .",
    "this happens at a time @xmath51 .",
    "assuming then @xmath52 @xcite , we find , @xmath53 we thus find that the merging time is longer than the ion weibel saturation time by a factor @xmath54 . as a consequence ,",
    "the uncertainty on the ion weibel growth rate does not affect significantly the formation time . in order to find out whether or not the flow is stopped in the overlapping region by @xmath51 , we need to compare @xmath55 , the size of this region at this time , with the ion larmor radius @xmath56 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath57 as a consequence , the incoming flow is stopped in the overlapping region , and the shock starts forming .",
    "the downstream density at time @xmath51 is still only twice the upstream density . in order to reach the expected density jump of 3 for the 2d case , the system needs to evolve another @xmath51 since the overlapping region no longer expands @xcite . in the 3d case ,",
    "the expected density jump is @xmath58 so that waiting another @xmath59 is required to bring enough material in the central region .",
    "note that the present 2d model of the filaments merging as been successfully tested against 3d pic simulation @xcite .",
    "the shock formation time @xmath60 finally reads , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the dimensionality of the system ( @xmath63 for a 2d ( 3d ) setup ) .",
    "noteworthily , the expression does not reduce to the one obtained for a pair plasma by setting @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that here we simply neglect the electron instability phase in the end result .",
    "finally , we note that shocks in electron - ion plasmas form much slower than in pair plasmas for two reasons : on the one hand , the instability mechanism is slower while on the other hand , the merging phase is negligible in pair plasmas because the instability already generates filaments and fields large enough to deflect the flow .      for comparison of the shock formation times of pair and electron - ion shocks ,",
    "( [ eq : pair_time ] ) gives the formation time @xmath65 for the pair case @xcite @xmath66 in terms of the dimension @xmath62 of the problem , whereas from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ei_time ] ) we obtain for electron - ion shocks @xmath67 considering @xmath68 , which is the value obtained in the pair shock simulations presented in the next section , we find that an electron - ion shock forms 60 times slower than a pair shock for a mass ratio of 400 , and 166 slower for a realistic mass ratio . for a mass ratio of 400 , @xmath69 whereas @xmath70 for a mass ratio of 100 .",
    "we present now a series of 2d pic simulations in order to validate the theoretical model .",

    "the evolution of the magnetic energy density shows several stages . the ion weibel instability grows slower than @xmath85 due to the influence of the hot electron background @xcite , which is negligible when compared to the full formation time .",
