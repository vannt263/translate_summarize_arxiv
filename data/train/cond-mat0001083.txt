    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite has been widely applied to one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum systems and two - dimensional ( 2d ) classical systems @xcite .",
    "a frontier in dmrg is to extend its numerical algorithm to higher dimensional systems , chiefly for 2d quantum and 3d classical systems .",
    "as far as the finite system algorithm is concerned , decomposition of higher - dimensional clusters to 1d chains proposed by liang and pang works efficiently @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we have not obtained any satisfactory answer to extend dmrg toward infinite - size systems in higher dimension .",
    "nishino and okunishi proposed a way of extending dmrg to 3d classical systems , which they call ` the corner tensor renormalization group ( cttrg ) ' @xcite , as a 3d generalization of both the transfer matrix dmrg @xcite and the corner transfer matrix renormalization group ( ctmrg ) @xcite for 2d classical systems .",
    "two major problems are found in cttrg when it is applied to the 3d ising model .",
    "one is that the calculated transition temperature @xmath0 is much higher than one of the most reliable @xmath0 obtained by the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "the other problem is the very slow decay of the the density - matrix eigenvalues @xcite , that spoils the numerical efficiency of the block - spin transformation .",
    "a way of generalizing dmrg to higher dimensions is to investigate the variational structure of dmrg , where the variational state for the transfer matrix or the hamiltonian is written in a product of orthogonal matrices @xcite .",
    "two types of 2d tensor product states have been considered as higher - dimensional extensions of this matrix product state .",
    "one is ` the interaction round a face ( irf ) ' type product states shown in figure ( [ fig:1](a ) ) @xcite , and the other is the vertex type one in figure ( [ fig:1](b ) ) @xcite . for a 2d tensor product state @xmath1 , the variational energy and the variational partition function , respectively , is written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denotes a hamiltonian for a 2d quantum system and a transfer matrix for a 3d classical system .",
    "let us call such a variational estimation as ` the tensor product variational approximation ( tpva ) ' in the following .",
    "calculation of @xmath5 have been performed by mc simulation @xcite , product wave function renormalization group ( pwfrg ) @xcite or ctmrg @xcite . a key point in tpva",
    "is to find a good variational state @xmath1 .",
    "so far , they assumed a specific form of @xmath1 , which contains several variational parameters , and tried to find out the best @xmath1 by way of the parameter sweep .",
    "for example , okunishi and nishino @xcite investigated tpva for the 3d ising model , assuming @xmath1 in the form of the kramers - wannier ( kw ) approximation @xcite .",
    "their variational state contains two adjustable parameters , and the best @xmath1 is obtained through a two - parameter sweep .",
    "such an intuitive construction of @xmath1 is , however , not always applicable ; for example , we do nt know how to extend the kw approximation for the 3d potts models @xcite .",
    "how can we obtain the best @xmath1 automatically for higher - dimensional systems ?",
    "we find an answer for 3d classical systems .    in this paper",
    "we propose a self - consistent improvement for the tensor product state @xmath1 by way of ctmrg .",
    "we choose the 3d ising model as an example of the 3d classical systems , and formulate our self - consistent method in terms of the ising model . in the next section , we introduce the simplest 2d tensor product state , and give the formal expression of the variational partition function @xmath5 in eq.([varf ] ) .",
    "we then obtain the self - consistent equation for @xmath1 in  3 , considering the variation @xmath6 . in ",
    "4 we propose a numerical algorithm to solve the self - consistent equation . in  5 we check the numerical efficiency and stability of this algorithm when it is applied to the 3d ising model and the 3-state ( @xmath7 ) 3d potts model .",
    "conclusions are summarized in  6 .",
    "we briefly review the variational formulation of tpva that was used for the kw approximation of the 3d ising model @xcite .",
    "let us consider the 3d ising model on the simple cubic lattice of the size @xmath8 to @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions , respectively , where open ( or fixed ) boundary conditions are assumed for both @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions .",

    "to summarize , we put three additional steps ( a ) , ( c ) and ( d ) to the standard ctmrg algorithm .",
    "let us check the numerical efficiency and stability of the self - consistent tpva through trial applications to the 3d ising model and the ferromagnetic @xmath7 potts model . figure ( [ fig:5 ] ) shows the spontaneous magnetization @xmath113 at the center of the @xmath114 system , where the curve , cross marks , and triangles , respectively , represent the result of the mc simulation by tarpov and blte @xcite , kw approximation @xcite , and the self - consistent tpva .",
    "we calculate @xmath115 after repeating the iteration ( c)-(g ) in the last section for @xmath116 times at most , keeping @xmath117 to @xmath118 states for the block spin variables ; the convergence with respect to @xmath85 is very fast , where we obtain almost the same @xmath115 for the cases @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",

    "it turns out that the spontaneous magnetization calculated by kw approximation , which gives the transition point @xmath123 , is quite close to the result of the self - consistent ( sc ) tpva .",
    "this means that the intuitive choice of the variational state in kw approximation is actually very good , within the simplest product state defined in eq.([prods ] ) .",
    "inclusion of auxiliary variables to the tensor product state is necessary for the further improvement of the tensor product variational state .",
    "note that the computational time required for the kw approximation is several times larger than the self - consistent tpva , because the former finds the partition function extremum via 2-parameter sweep .",

    "the self - consistent improvement by eq.([improv ] ) is again monotonous , and @xmath125 is sufficient to get the converged data ; we need smaller @xmath66 for the potts model than ising model , because the phase transition of the potts model is first order . the calculated energy per bond jumps from @xmath126 to @xmath127 at the calculated transition point @xmath128 , where the calculated free energy of the disordered phase coincides with that of the ordered phase .",
    "the calculated transition point is about 0.18% smaller than one of the most reliable mc result @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "the latent heat @xmath130 is about 41% larger than the mc result @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "we have proposed a self - consistent tpva , which gives the optimized tensor product state for 3d classical systems , by way of the self - consistent improvement of the local tensors .",
    "since the method finds out the best variational state without using a priori knowledge of the system , the self - consistent tpva is applicable for various 3d models described by short range interactions .    to generalize the self - consistent tpva to 2d quantum systems",
    "is a next subject that one might consider .",
    "this generalization is not trivial , since we have used the specific property of 3d classical systems when we obtain the self - consistent equation .",
