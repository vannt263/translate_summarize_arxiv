    "with the b  factories at work , search of rare decays induced by the flavor  changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath1 is now entering a new interesting era .",
    "these transitions provide an important consistency check of the standard model ( sm ) at loop level , since fcnc transitions are forbidden in the sm at tree level .",
    "these decays induced by the fcnc are very sensitive to the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "new physics appear in rare decays through the wilson coefficients which can take values different from their sm counterpart or through the new operator structures in an effective hamiltonian .",
    "first measurements of the @xmath2 decay were reported by cleo collaboration @xcite and more precise measurements are currently being carried out in the experiments at b factories ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "exclusive decay involving the @xmath3 transition has been measured in @xcite .",
    "after these measurements of the radiative decay induced by the @xmath3 transition , main interest has been focused on the rare decays induced by the @xmath4 transitions , which have relatively large branching ratio in the sm .",
    "these decays have been extensively studied in the sm and its various extensions @xcite@xcite .",
    "the exclusive @xmath5 decays , which are described by @xmath4 transition at quark level , have been studied comprehensively in literature ( see @xcite@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , belle and babar collaborations announced the following results for the branching ratios of both decays : ( b k^^+ ^- ) = \\ {    lc ( 11.5^+2.6_-2.4 0.8 0.2 ) 10 ^ -7 & @xcite  , +   + ( 0.88^+0.33_-0.29 ) 10 ^ -6 & @xcite  ,    .",

    "interest to the baryonic decays can be attributed to the fact that , unlike mesonic decays , they could maintain the helicity structure of the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath6 transition .",
    "note that , new physics effects in the @xmath0 decay are studied in @xcite .",
    "experimentally measurable quantities such as branching ratio @xcite , @xmath7 polarization and single lepton polarization have already been studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "study of such quantities can give useful information for more precise determination of the sm parameters and looking for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that the study of the polarizations of both leptons provides measurement of many more observables which would be useful in further improvement of the parameters of the sm and probing new physics beyond the sm .    in the present work",
    "we analyze the possibility of searching for new physics in the baryonic @xmath0 decay by studying the polarized forward  backward asymmetry of various double  lepton polarizations , using a general form of the effective hamiltonian , including all possible forms of interactions .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the sensitivity of polarized forward ",
    "backward asymmetry to the new wilson coefficients for the meson@xmath8meson transition has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "naturally , one is forced to ask what happens to this sensitivity in the case of baryon@xmath8baryon transition , i.e. , which polarized asymmetry is sensitive to which new wilson coefficients for the baryon@xmath8baryon transition .",
    "a detailed investigation of this problem is the main goal of the present work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using the general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian , the matrix element for the @xmath0 is obtained . in section 3 the analytic expressions for the polarized forward  backward asymmetry are derived .",

    "therefore , if @xmath107 and @xmath108 are measured far from zero position in the future  planned experiments , the sign of these asymmetries can give unambiguous information about new physics beyond the sm , more precisely , about the existence of the tensor type interaction ( see figs .",
