    "supermassive black holes ( mbhs ) at the centers of bulges and elliptical galaxies play an important role in the processes of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , cattaneo et al .",
    "2009 ) , as testified by remarkable correlations between host galaxy properties and the mbh masses ( e.g. , magorrian et al .",
    "1998 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , graham et al .  2001 ) and as supported by many theoretical studies ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 , haiman , ciotti & ostriker 2004 ; merloni et al .",
    "2004 , sazonov et al .",
    "2005 , di matteo , springel & hernquist 2005 , hopkins et al .",
    "2006 , somerville et al .",
    "2008 , kormendy et al .",
    "an important aspect of the coevolution process is the radiative and mechanical feedback by the accreting mbh onto the galactic interstellar mediun ( ism ) that is continuously replenished by normal stellar mass losses , at a rate of the order of @xmath11 yr@xmath12 in a medium - mass galaxy . in absence of feedback from a central mbh ( and stripping from the intracluster medium in case of satellite galaxies ) , this ism would develop a flow directed towards the galactic center , accreting @xmath13 yr@xmath12 in a process similar to a `` cooling flow '' . instead , in low mass galaxies , type ia supernova ( snia ) heating is able to sustain a low - luminosity , global galactic wind ( e.g. , ciotti et al .  1991 , david et al .",
    "1991 , pellegrini & ciotti 1998 ) , and the central mbh is in a state of permanent , highly sub - eddington hot accretion ( ciotti & ostriker 2011 ) .",
    "therefore , in medium to high mass galaxies , feedback is required by the following empirical arguments : 1 ) the large amount of gas lost by the passively evolving stellar population during the galaxies lifetime is not observed ( e.g. , peterson & fabian 2006 ) , and just @xmath141% of the mass made available by stars is contained in the masses of present epoch mbhs ; 2 ) bright agns , as would be expected given the predicted mass accretion rate , are not commonly seen in the spheroids of the local universe ( e.g. , fabian & canizares 1988 , pellegrini 2005 ) .",
    "thus agn feedback is required just on the basis of a mass balance argument . since over a large part of the galaxies extent , and for a large fraction of their lifetime , the ism cooling time @xmath15 is much lower than the galaxy age , one early quasar phase can not be the solution to the cooling flow problem .",
    "the solution requires either steady heating , or heating with bursts on a timescale @xmath16 .",
    "unfortunately , on a purely theoretical ground , how much radiative and mechanical energy and momentum output from the mbh can effectively interact with the surrounding ism , and what are the resultant mbh masses , is difficult to establish .",
    "recently , the interaction of the mbh output with the inflowing gas has been studied with high - resolution 1d hydrodynamical simulations in a series of papers ( ciotti & ostriker 2007 ; ciotti , ostriker & proga 2009 , 2010 hereafter papers i and iii ; shin , ostriker & ciotti 2010a , b ; ostriker et al .",
    "2010 ; jiang et al .",
    "2010 ) , that are currently being extended to 2d treatments ( novak , ostriker & ciotti 2010 ) .",
    "these simulations implement a physically based detailed treatment of the radiative energy and momentum input from the mbh into the ism , consistent both with observed average agn spectra and theoretical calculations of radiation transport ; they also include starformation , and a modelling of the mechanical energy and momentum feedback from agn winds .",
    "the combined effects of radiative and mechanical feedback produce recurrent agn burst phases accompanied by starformation , spaced apart by longer phases of relative quiescence .",
    "a cycle repeats with the galaxy seen alternately as an agn / starburst for a small fraction of the time , and as a `` normal '' elliptical for much longer intervals .",
    "accretion fueled feedback thus proves effective in suppressing long lasting cooling flows and in maintaining mbh masses within the range observed today , since the gas is mostly lost in outflows or consumed in starbursts .",
    "remarkably , _ while star formation is suppressed when the agn is in the low - luminosity state , it is enhanced by the strong agn outbursts , consistent with observations _",
    "( schawinski et al .",
    "note finally that a major role in producing global degassing , and in regulating the flow evolution , is also played by the snia s heating .    the previous papers , with the exception of pellegrini , ciotti & ostriker ( 2009 ) , were mainly dedicated to the study of the accretion physics and the feedback effects . here",
    "instead we focus on the appearance that the models would have if observed in the x - ray band , both in quiescence and during an outburst of activity .",
    "we concentrate on two models ( named and ) extracted from the suite of cases presented in paper iii ( table 1 therein ) , characterized by a mechanical feedback efficiency dependent on the eddington scaled accretion luminosity . and were considered particularly successful , since their input parameters agree with previous theoretical studies or observations ( as , e.g. , for the agn wind opening angle , and the peak value of mechanical efficiency , that are in accord with those estimated from 2d and 3d numerical simulations ; proga , stone & kallman 2000 , proga & kallman 2004 , benson & babul 2009 ) , and , at the same time , their final properties ( as mass fraction of a younger stellar population , mbh mass , etc . )",
    "are in reasonable accord with observations . the only difference in the input physics of and",
    "is the maximum value of the mechanical efficiency . since in the simulations the treatment of feedback",
    "is physically based , not tuned to reproduce observations , any agreement or discrepancy of the resulting model properties with x - ray observations is relevant to improving our understanding of the mbh - ism coevolution , putting further constraints on the input ingredients , and possibly telling us what additional physics may be important in the problem . however , we stress that the models describe an isolated galaxy , where ram - pressure stripping ( in case of satellite galaxies ) and intracluster medium pressure confinement ( in case of group or cluster central galaxies ) are not taken into account ( see shin et al .",
    "2010b ) .",
    "the main observational signatures investigated here include the nuclear and gaseous emissions , and the ism temperature and brightness profiles in the quiescent phases , and before , during , after a burst .",
    "particular attention is paid to the appearance and detectability of central hot bubbles , with diameters of @xmath17a hundred parsecs , that are produced by the models during outbursts , and to various kinds of disturbances in the hot ism .",
    "the analysis is performed in the soft and hard x - ray bands , also after unsharp - masking .",
    "these predictions are relevant for their observational consequences , since the high angular resolution of the @xmath18 satellite has allowed us to obtain the best definition ever for the hot gas properties of the galaxies of the local universe , by separating the contributions of stellar sources and hot gas , and the emission coming from different spatial regions within galaxies ( e.g. , fabbiano 2011 ) .",
    "in particular , in several elliptical galaxies various kinds of hot gas disturbances have been detected , likely resultant from nuclear activity ( e.g. , finoguenov & jones 2001 , jones et al .",
    "2002 , forman et al .  2005 , machacek et al .",
    "2006 , osullivan et al .",
    "2007 , million et al . 2010 ) . at the same time",
    ", nuclear emission values have been detected down to very low luminosities , comparable to those of x - ray binaries ( e.g. , loewenstein et al .",
    "2001 , gallo et al . 2010 , pellegrini 2010 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 summarizes the main evolutionary phases of the representative models ( and ) considered ; section 3 describes how the observational properties of the models are derived ; section 4 presents a comparison of the nuclear luminosities with existing observations ; section 5 discusses the evolution of the x - ray luminosity and emission - weighted temperature of the ism ; section 6 presents the projected temperature and surface brightness profiles at representative times during quiescence and a nuclear outburst .",
    "finally , in section 7 we summarize and discuss the main results .",
    "the basic ideas behind the present class of models for feedback modulated accretion flows have been introduced in ciotti & ostriker ( 1997 , 2001 ) , and ostriker & ciotti ( 2005 ) , and developed in detail in the papers listed in the introduction ; a comprehensive recent discussion is given in ciotti & ostriker ( 2011 ) .",
    "here we focus on models and from paper iii ( where the description of the numerical code and the input physics is given ) .",
    "the initial parameter values and the main final properties of the models are given in table  [ modref ] .",
    "the two models refer to an isolated elliptical galaxy placed on the fundamental plane , with a projected central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath19 km s@xmath12 , a total b - band luminosity @xmath20 , and an effective radius @xmath21 kpc .",
    "the stellar density profile is described by a jaffe ( 1983 ) law , and the dark halo profile is such that the total ( stellar+dark ) mass density profile scales as @xmath22 at large radii ; all relevant dynamical properties used in the code are discussed in ciotti , morganti & de zeeuw ( 2009 ) .",
    "the dark - to - visible mass ratio is one within @xmath5 , and the resulting stellar mass - to - light ratio is @xmath23 .",
    "finally , a standard snia s rate declining with time @xmath24 as @xmath25 is assumed .",
    "the initial mbh mass is set to @xmath26 the initial stellar mass @xmath27 , i.e. , it is @xmath28 .",
    "the simulations begin at a galaxy age of @xmath29 gyr ( that is a redshift @xmath30 , the exact value depending on the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation , usually put at @xmath31 ) .    the efficiency for producing radiation ( soltan 1982 , yu & tremaine 2002 ) of material accreting on the mbh at the rate @xmath32 is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the eddington - scaled accretion rate .",
    "thus , for @xmath35 , one has @xmath36 at large mass accretion rates @xmath37 , and @xmath38 declining as for radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs , narayan & yi 1994 ) , as @xmath39 , for @xmath40 ( see also sect .",
    "[ nuc ] for additional comments on this choice ) .",
    "the mechanical feedback implemented is that of the broad line region winds ( leading to outflow velocities of @xmath41 km / s , similar to what observed , e.g. chartas et al .",
    "2003 , crenshaw et al .  2003 ) , and reproduces the main features of the numerical modeling by proga ( 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , the mechanical efficiency scales with the eddington ratio @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 is the instantaneous bolometric accretion luminosity ) , reaching a maximum value @xmath44 of @xmath45 ( for ) , and @xmath26 ( for ) , when @xmath46 ; also , the aperture solid angle of the conical nuclear wind increases at increasing @xmath8 . note that the values of the mechanical efficiency in cols .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of tab .",
    "[ modref ] are to be contrasted with the generally higher fixed efficiency of @xmath47 commonly adopted in the literature ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "2005 , di matteo et al . 2005 , johansson et al .",
    "the mechanical output of a nuclear jet is also computed , but not added to the hydrodynamical equations , and it will be inserted in a future work .",
    "the evolution of the gas flows is obtained integrating the time - dependent ( 1d ) eulerian equations of hydrodynamics , with a logarithmically spaced and staggered radial grid , extending from 2.5 pc from the central mbh to 250 kpc .",
    "it is most important that the resolution is high enough that the inner boundary is within the bondi radius ( bondi 1952 ) ; if this is not ensured , the accretion rate will be calculated incorrectly .",
    "thus `` bondi accretion '' is not assumed ; the correct , time - dependent accretion rate is computed from the hydrodynamical equations .    the code derives self - consistenly the source and sink terms of mass , momentum and energy associated with the evolving stellar population ( stellar mass losses , snia events ) , the temporal steepening of the stellar velocity dispersion within the sphere of influence of the mbh as a consequence of its growth , the star formation during nuclear starbursts , and finally accretion and mbh feedback .",
    "needless to say , the code conserves mass , energy , and momentum ( e.g. , ostriker et al . 2010 ) .",
    "gas heating and cooling are calculated for a photoionized plasma in equilibrium with an average quasar spectral energy distribution ( as detailed by sazonov et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the resulting radiation pressure and absorption / emission are computed and distributed over the ism from numerical integration of the radiative transport equation .",
    "the effects of radiation pressure on dust due to the starburst luminosity in the optical , uv and infrared are also considered .",
    "a circumnuclear accretion disk is modeled at the level of `` sub - grid '' physics , and a set of differential equations describing the mass flow on the disk , its star formation rate , mass ejection and finally mbh accretion are solved at each time - step .    the resulting evolution of @xmath48 for and is shown in fig .",
    "these models have fairly standard values of the input parameters , and their general properties in the x - ray band , are typical of the class of 1d models investigated in paper iii . at the beginning ,",
    "the galaxy is replenished by gas produced by the mass return from the evolving stars .",
    "soon agn outbursts develop , due to accretion of this gas , accompanied by star formation , and followed by degassing and a precipitous drop of the nuclear accretion rate .",
    "the outbursts are separated by long time intervals during which the galaxy is replenished again by gas from the stellar mass losses .",
    "the behavior of the gas during an outburst is almost independent of the specific burst episode considered .",
    "the outburst precursor is the off - center growth of a thin shell of dense gas ( at a radius of @xmath49 kpc ) that progressively cools below x - ray emitting temperatures and falls towards the center ; compression of the enclosed gas follows and a central burst is triggered , even before the cold shell reaches the center k. ] . in less than a million years , a radiative shock originates from the center and quickly ( in @xmath50 yrs ) produces an outward moving shell that collides with the original shell falling in .",
    "reflected shock waves carry fresh material for accretion , and produce new sub - bursts .",
    "this leads to the rich temporal structure of each outburst event , especially visible in model ( bottom panel , fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . eventually , the cold material left after starformation ( ciotti & ostriker 2007 ) is accreted in a final burst , a major shock leaves behind a very hot and dense center , and causes a substantial galaxy degassing . in general , while radiative effects mainly work on the kpc scale , mechanical feedback from the agn winds is more concentrated and affects the ism on the @xmath51 pc scale ( see fig .  11 in paper iii ) . during the next few tens",
    "of million years , the gas cools , resumes its subsonic velocity , the density starts increasing again due to stellar mass losses , and the cycle repeats . at late epochs ,",
    "the gas flows finally set in a state of steady , hot and low - luminosity accretion .",
    "the observational model properties considered in paper iii were the nuclear bolometric , optical and uv luminosities , and the x - ray luminosity of the ism within @xmath52 .",
    "the latter was evaluated fiducially just by cutting the bolometric gas emission below a threshold temperature of @xmath53 k. in the following , we calculate the x - ray luminosity of the nucleus ( @xmath54 , sect .  [ nuc ] ) , and , with a more detailed and realistic procedure , the total luminosity and emission weighted temperature of the hot gas ( @xmath4 and @xmath55 , sect .",
    "[ global ] ) ; we also calculate the temperature and the surface brightness profiles during quiescent times , and during an outburst ( sect .",
    "[ proj ] ) .",
    "we briefly describe below how the observational gas properties are calculated from the numerical outputs for the gas density and temperature .",
    "the x - ray emission of the different model components is calculated over the energy range of 0.3 - 8 kev ( the @xmath18 sensitivity band ) , and also in two separate bands , 0.3 - 2 kev ( `` soft '' ) and 2 - 8 kev ( `` hard '' ) , typically used in studies of the nuclear and gaseous properties . in practice , at any given time , the volume gas luminosity is calculated from the gas density and temperature distribution on the numerical grid as @xmath56 where the emissivity is given by @xmath57 $ ] , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the number densities of electrons and hydrogen , and @xmath60 is the cooling function .",
    "the cooling function is calculated over the two energy intervals by means of the radiative emission code apec , valid for hot plasmas at the collisional ionization equilibrium ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) , as available in the xspec package for the analysis of the x - ray data . for simplicity",
    "we choose constant abundance at the solar value , and the solar abundance ratios of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) , which is consistent with observed gas metallicities ( e.g. , loewenstein & davis 2010 ) . in order to speed - up the analysis , we derived with apec the values of @xmath61 , for each energy band , for a large set of temperatures in the range 0.1 - 16 kev ; then we obtained two very accurate non - linear fits of the tabulated values ( with maximum deviations @xmath62% , see ciotti & pellegrini 2008 ) .",
    "these fits were used to compute the integral in ( [ lumeq ] ) , and in every other integration where the emissivity is needed .",
    "for example the emission weighted temperature for the whole galactic volume was computed as @xmath63 the surface brightness profile @xmath64 , the emission weighted projected temperature profile @xmath65 , and the associated emission weighted aperture temperature profile @xmath66 , were obtained by numerical integration of the simulation outputs as @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 the accuracy of the integrations above is verified by checking that the surface integral of @xmath64 over the whole grid recovers the same luminosity calculated via equation ( [ lumeq ] ) , and that @xmath70 within few percent ( ciotti & pellegrini 2008 ) .",
    "the surface integral of @xmath64 is also used to compute the gas emission within the optical effective radius @xmath71 , and in equation ( [ ta ] ) to compute the average temperature within the optical effective radius .    in order to highlight local departures from the mean ism brightness profile , and to evidence major",
    "brightness features that could be revealed by observations , `` fluctuation '' profiles have been also created .",
    "these have been constructed with a technique similar to the so - called unsharp masking , frequently adopted in observational analysis ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "2003 ) . in practice , the brightness profiles @xmath64 have been convolved with a 2d gaussian of dispersion @xmath72 : @xmath73 so that the resulting surface brightness profile can be written as @xmath74 where i@xmath75 is the zeroth - order modified bessel function of first kind . in the analysis of the simulations , the integral above is solved numerically , after a careful choice of @xmath72 . as expected , a too large @xmath72 produces an almost featureless profile , while a too small @xmath76 reproduces the unprocessed profile . after some attempts , it turned out that , in order to highlight local features , the optimal choice is that of a @xmath76 equal , at each gridpoint , to the sum of the lengths of the immediately preceding and subsequent grid intervals .",
    "the `` unsharp - masked '' profile is then defined in a natural way as @xmath77",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows the time evolution of the nuclear bolometric accretion luminosity @xmath48 for and ( whose input parameters differ only for the maximum value of the mechanical efficiency @xmath78 , that is respectively @xmath26 and @xmath79 , tab .  [ modref ] ) . strong intermittencies at an earlier epoch , with @xmath48 reaching the eddington value , become rarer and rarer with time , as the mass return rate from the stellar population declines , until a smooth , hot , and very sub - eddington accretion phase establishes .",
    "the different mechanical efficiency is responsible for the sharp bursts in model , and the more time - extended and structured bursts in model ( paper iii ) . towards the present epoch , at a galaxy age of 12 gyr , the mass accretion rate on the mbh for both models is @xmath80/yr , that translates into an eddington scaled accretion rate @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively for and .",
    "the value of @xmath83 of is a bit smaller than for , because of its larger final @xmath84 ( tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] ) , a consequence of the weaker mechanical feedback . at the present time , and during the interburst periods , accretion has then entered the riaf regime , and the radiative efficiency is @xmath85 ; the nuclear bolometric luminosity is @xmath86 erg s@xmath12 for both models , and the corresponding eddington ratios are @xmath87 ( ) and @xmath88 ( ) , see tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] .",
    "these results agree with the observation that in the local universe massive mbhs are mostly radiatively quiescent , and the fraction of them at luminosities approaching their eddington limit is negligible ( e.g. , ho 2008 ) .",
    "for example , in the sample of nuclei of the palomar spectroscopic survey of northern galaxies , a nearly complete sample , magnitude limited at @xmath89 mag , @xmath90% of ellipticals show detectable emission line nuclei% ) of the sample of red sequence galaxies of the sdss ( @xmath91 , median redshift @xmath92 ) have detectable line emission ( yan et al .",
    "] , but mostly of low level ( @xmath93 erg / s ; ho 2008 ) . for this sample ,",
    "the nuclear bolometric luminosity @xmath94 was derived from the observed nuclear 2 - 10 kev emission , using the correction @xmath95 ( ho 2009 ) .",
    "it was found that elliptical galaxies span a large range of @xmath96 , from @xmath97 to @xmath98 erg s@xmath12 , with a median value of @xmath99 erg s@xmath12 and a mean value of @xmath100 erg s@xmath12 ; the eddington scaled luminosity @xmath8 has a median value of @xmath101 ( mean @xmath102 ) , with @xmath103 for elliptical galaxies , and extending down to @xmath104 .",
    "the representative models tend therefore to lie on the upper end of the observed distributions of @xmath96 and @xmath8 , a result that probably remains true regardless of the uncertainty in the bolometric correction from the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "we will return on this point ( already noticed in papers i and iii ) in the conclusions .",
    "another way of comparing the model @xmath48 with observed values , is to estimate @xmath54 of the models , and compare it directly with observed @xmath105 values .",
    "accurate @xmath105 measurements in a large number have been derived recently for elliptical galaxies of the local universe , based on @xmath18 data ( e.g. , gallo et al .",
    "2010 , pellegrini 2010 ) ; in the 0.310 kev band , @xmath105 ranges from @xmath106 erg s@xmath12 to @xmath107 erg s@xmath12 , with most of @xmath108 as low as @xmath109@xmath110 .",
    "in particular , for the final mbh masses of the models ( tab .  [ tab2 ] ) , it is observed that @xmath111(erg s@xmath112 , and @xmath113 , both from the sample of the @xmath114 virgo cluster survey ( gallo et al .",
    "2010 ) , and that of 112 early type galaxies within @xmath115 mpc ( pellegrini 2010 ) .",
    "the 0.3 - 10 kev nuclear luminosity @xmath54 of the models at the present epoch can be derived adopting a correction factor appropriate for the spectral energy distribution of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow , i.e. , @xmath116 for low luminosity agns ( mahadevan 1997 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath117 erg s@xmath12 , and @xmath118 .",
    "also in the x - ray band , then , the model nuclear luminosity tends to be larger than what typically observed ; @xmath119 is within the observed range , though lying in its upper end .",
    "all this may suggest that in real galaxies an additional mechanism is reducing further the mass available for accretion , as could be provided by a nuclear jet , and/or a thermally driven wind from a riaf ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "only a fraction of the gas within the accretion radius actually reaches the mbh ; the binding energy released by the accreting gas is transported radially outward to drive away the remainder in the form of a wind .",
    "alternatively , it may be that the quadratic dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath83 ( sect .",
    "[ repmod ] ) sets in at a higher value of @xmath83 than adopted in eq .",
    "[ effic ] , for which it starts at @xmath120 . within the uncertainties on the observational and theoretical input , we might have chosen the constant @xmath121 rather than 100 ; in this way , the quadratic dependence would have set in at @xmath122 rather than @xmath123 .",
    "this would have reduced the late time nuclear luminosity by a factor of @xmath124 , as confirmed by a supplementary run .",
    "the bursts are more extended in time , with a larger accreted mbh mass , which reduces slightly also the final @xmath8 ratio .",
    "] of models and with @xmath121 .",
    "finally , another interesting - albeit more difficult - comparison with observational results can be done using the duty - cycle .",
    "the latter can be calculated as the fraction of the total time spent by the agn in the `` on '' state , defined by a luminosity greater than @xmath125 in a given band , over some temporal baseline ( paper iii ) .",
    "so doing , the duty - cycle turns out to be a small number ( tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] ) ; for example , for a temporal baseline ending at the present epoch ( i.e. , at 13 gyr in fig .  [ f1 ] ) , the duty - cycle of model is zero when starting from 9 gyr ( at a redshift @xmath126 , for a flat universe with @xmath127 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 ) , as no burst occurs after @xmath130 gyr ; when starting from 6 gyr ( @xmath131 ) , it is @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 respectively in the bolometric , optical ( absorbed ) , and uv ( absorbed ) bands . for model , in the same bands , the duty - cycle is respectively @xmath135 ( when starting at 9 gyr ) , and @xmath136 ( when starting at 6 gyr ) .",
    "the duty - cycle decreases from the bolometric , to the optical , to the uv bands , due to the different values of the opacity in these bands .",
    "these duty - cycle values are broadly consistent with the fraction of active galaxies measured in observational works . for example",
    ", greene & ho ( 2007 ) estimated the ( mass dependent ) number of active galaxies , using broad - line luminosities from sdss dr4 , for galaxies with @xmath137 ( age of the universe @xmath138 gyr ) ; statistically speaking , the fraction of active systems can be interpreted as a duty cycle for mbhs in a given mass range .",
    "greene & ho report duty - cycle values of the order of @xmath139 for @xmath140 @xmath141 mbhs , declining at increasing mass .",
    "similar duty - cycle values of @xmath142 , decreasing at increasing mbh mass , are reported by heckman et al .",
    "the duty - cyles of the models tend to be larger than those observed ; however , the comparison is limited by the small number of models considered , and the fact that the only way to compute duty - cycles different from zero is to extend the temporal baseline back in the past .",
    "a more consistent comparison with observations can be made with an increased dataset of models , and computing the duty cycle for the last 23 gyrs .",
    "clearly this procedure will reduce the duty cycle , as the models are characterized by a declining nuclear activity .",
    "again , the computed duty cycle would have been reduced significantly also if we had raised the threshold for riaf - like behavior of the radiative efficiency to @xmath143 .",
    "we describe here the time evolution of the global thermal luminosity and temperature of the ism .",
    "the top panels of fig .  [ f2 ] show the time evolution of the total gas emission @xmath4 for models ( left ) and ( right ) .",
    "red lines refer to the soft ( 0.3 - 2 kev ) band , and blue lines to the hard ( 2 - 8 kev ) band ; for reference , the scaled - down @xmath48 ( black dotted line ) is also shown .",
    "the luminosity evolution of the gas for the two models is qualitatively similar , with peaks in @xmath4 coinciding with those in @xmath48 .",
    "the sudden increase of the gas emission during outbursts is due to the increase in temperature and density in the central galactic regions ( @xmath144 pc ) , caused by radiative gas heating ( compton and photoionization ) , and by compression due to direct and reflected shock waves , produced by mechanical and radiative feedback , that are associated with the agn and the starburst . for short times ,",
    "most of the luminosity in the peaks of @xmath4 originates from a very small region at the galactic center ( @xmath6 pc ) , thus it is observationally indistinguishable from the luminosity of the nucleus ( see also sect .  [ brilx ] ) .",
    "the hard emission oscillates in phase with the soft one , and presents the same overall behavior , but keeps at a level almost 2 orders of magnitude lower .",
    "hard emission during the outburst , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , would be detectable with @xmath18 , if centrally concentrated ( see also sect .",

    "this is due to the coexistence of hot ( the central bubble ) and cold ( the radiative shells ) ism phases during the bursts , as revealed by the temporal evolution of the radial profiles of the gas density and temperature ( paper iii ) .",
    "the sharp and high peaks in the hard band ( blue ) correspond to the onset of very hot regions at the center , while the decrements in the soft band ( red ) are due to a dense cold shell created immediately before the major burst , and to cold gas accumulated by the passage of radiative shock waves produced by the outburst ( see also sect .  [ tempx ] ) .",
    "a second , observationally relevant feature is that in each band @xmath167 is higher than @xmath165 , which is especially evident in the interburst periods ( fig .",

    "such a positive outer gradient is shown by galaxies in high - density environments , suggesting the influence of circumgalactic hot gas ; also , these galaxies have typically a larger hot gas content than the models .",
    "environmental confining effects , currently not included in the models , are expected to increase the gas luminosity , and produce outer postitive gradients ( see , e.g. , sarazin & white 1987 , vedder et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that galaxies could behave according to a scenario where weak radio agn distribute their heat locally and host negative inner temperature gradients , whereas more luminous radio agns heat the gas more globally through a jet or rising bubbles , and produce a flat profile , or a positive gradient ( diehl & statler 2008b ) . our models during quiescence could correspond to the weak agn phase ; also , after an outburst , the temperature profile can be flattish ( excluding the innermost bin ) out to a few kpc , and show a positive gradient outer of this radius ( see the red line of fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , bottom right panel ) .",
    "however , without a confining environment , an exploratory investigation conducted by us shows that the kinetic heating of a bright radio agn could cause a major degassing , rather than just a reversal of the temperature gradient from negative to flat or positive .",
    "likely , a gas rich environment providing confinement for the galactic coronae is a necessary condition to observe a bright ( extended ) radio source , and the confinement in turn also helps produce a positive temperature gradient in the outer galactic regions . both aspects ( the jet and a dense environment ) will be implemented in the models in the future .    in conclusion , the addition of a jet to the simulations could have positive effects , if it heats the gas outside @xmath199 , and reduces the accretion rate and then @xmath48 during the stationary hot accretion phase ( sect .",

    "disturbances as shells and ripples farther out in the galaxy last @xmath210 gyrs , and are more likely to be observed . given the typical duration of these features , and the presence of 34 major outbursts during the whole evolution , statistically they should be present , and possibly revealed by current x - ray observations , in @xmath179% of the galaxies with @xmath160 similar to the model galaxy .",
    "in fact , many nearby galaxies show a disturbed appearance , as most recently revealed by studies based on @xmath18 data ( e.g. , finoguenov & jones 2001 , forman et al .",
    "2005 , soria et al .",

    "the ism morphology of a large set of galaxies ( 54 ) shows a level of disturbance correlated with the radio luminosity derived by the nrao vla sky survey ( thus including both pointlike and extended radio emission ; diehl & statler 2008a ) .",
    "also , many of the best studied gas - rich galaxies show decrements in the x - ray surface brightness map , identified as cavities formed when agn jets inflate radio lobes and displace surrounding gas ; in many cases the cavities are filled with radio plasma , and surrounded by armlike features , sometimes classified as shocks .",
    "the hot gas disturbances have then been generally attributed to jet activity . as discussed above",
    ", we expect that if we took two cones from our solutions , they would give `` lobes '' .",
    "these would produce shocks at the edges and the lobes would be filled with radio emitting particles .",
    "there are also a few galaxies without currently evident extended radio emission , but with signs of an outflow and hot central gas , as ngc4552 ( machacek et al .",
    "this galaxy shows a weak core radio source unresolved by the vlba , and in the ( unsharp masked ) x - ray image two conspicuous ringlike features at 1.3 kpc from the galaxy center , surrounding two cavities ; these features have been found consistent with shocked gas driven outward by recent nuclear activity , as in a bipolar nuclear outflow .",
    "the gas temperature in the central @xmath51 pc of the galaxy is @xmath211 kev , hotter than elsewhere in the galaxy , suggesting that we may be directly observing the reheating of the galaxy ism by the outburst ( machacek et al .",
    "these characteristics resemble those predicted by the models for the temperature and the surface brighntess during the afterburst phase .",
    "the hot gas properties of massive ellipticals , with regard to luminosity and temperature , and their spatial distributions , allow us to derive insights into the hot gas evolutionary status , and its link with the host galaxy .",
    "since the cooling times are short compared to the galaxy age , it is now commonly accepted that repeated cooling catastrophes have occurred in the past , accompanied by central starbursts and agn outbursts .",
    "the interest of a better understanding of this phenomenon is obvious , as it is directly linked to galaxy formation and evolution , and to the growth of the central mbh .",
    "unfortunately , a complete theoretical picture is still missing , so that modeling coupled with a close comparison with observations is crucial in this field .",
    "in fact , these feedback events must leave signatures on the x - ray properties of the galaxies ; indeed , the observed temperature and brightness profiles often can not be fit easily with smooth profiles , or cooling flow profiles ( e.g. , sarazin 2011 , statler 2011 ) . in this work we have calculated the observational properties in the x - ray band of two galaxy models , representative of a class of detailed simulations of physically based models for the investigation of feedback modulated accretion in isolated galaxies .",
    "the feedback physics includes the combined effects of radiation and agn winds ( paper iii ) .",
    "the observational properties derived provide good matches to what observed in general for the local universe , and account for a few otherwise puzzling observed properties ; on the other hand , they also evidence the need for changes or additions to the input physics .",
    "the main results of the present investigation are the following :    \\1 ) after an evolution of @xmath212 gyr , the models are typically in a permanent quiescent phase .",
    "the bolometric nuclear emission is very sub - eddington ( @xmath213 ) , within the range observed for @xmath8 , though the most frequently observed values ( @xmath214 or less ) are somewhat lower .",
    "unfortunately , uncertainties in the bolometric correction to apply to observed nuclear luminosities , appropriate for a spectral energy distribution at low emission levels , do not allow to make a stringent comparison between modelled and observed values",
    ". however , also the nuclear x - ray emission @xmath215 of the models , estimated as @xmath116 as should be appropriate for low luminosity nuclei , and @xmath216 , tend to lie on the upper end of what is observed .",
    "thus in real galaxies an additional mechanism may be required to reduce further the mass available for accretion ; this could be provided by the mechanical feedback of a ( nuclear ) jet , and/or by a thermally driven wind from a riaf .",
    "alternatively , the switch from disc to riaf behavior ( that is @xmath217 ) should occur at a larger @xmath8 than assumed here ( e.g. , at @xmath218 rather than @xmath219 ) .",
    "simulations of ram - pressure stripping effects , instead , showed that a reduction in the accretion rate is not attained , because in the quiescent hot accretion regime , the accreting mass comes mainly from the stellar mass losses within the central @xmath51 parsecs of the galaxy , that are not affected by stripping ( shin et al .",
    "2010b ) .",
    "\\2 ) the x - ray luminosity of the ism oscillates in phase with the nuclear luminosity , though with much broader peaks ; at the present epoch , @xmath4 lies at the lower end of the large observed range for galaxies of @xmath160 similar to that of the models .",
    "the degassing / heating in the models may then be too efficient , or a larger / more concentrated gravitating mass , or a confining external medium , are needed .",
    "however , when the gas luminosities during the whole evolution are considered , the observed @xmath4 range is better reproduced .",
    "this is even more true if also an additional model of larger @xmath72 , and same @xmath160 , is included .",
    "part of the observed large variation in @xmath4 for galaxies of a given @xmath160 could then be explained by nuclear activity .",
    "\\3 ) the average ism temperature is within the observed large range for the model @xmath72 ; when estimated within @xmath5 , the model temperatures reproduce better the upper half of those observed . modifications to the models by the addition of a jet or an external medium , as suggested in the previous points , should then not increase the average temperature within @xmath5 .",
    "\\4 ) during quiescence , the profiles of the gas temperature and brightness resemble those observed for many local galaxies .",
    "especially remarkable is the lack of the steep brightness profile shape typical of inflowing models , due to the frequent removal of gas from the galactic central regions , and to the heating provided by mechanical feedback ( that is always present , even during quiescent phases ) .",
    "the models show negative temperature gradients , that are common for isolated galaxies ; the addition of a jet or a confining agent should change the temperature profiles into a flat or outwardly increasing profile , as also frequently observed for galaxies in rich environments .",
    "\\5 ) during outbursts , disturbances are predicted in the temperature and brightness profiles ; the ism resumes the smooth appearance of steady and low - luminosity hot accretion on the mbh on a time - scale of @xmath220 myrs .",
    "the most conspicuous variations with respect to smooth profiles are within current detection capabilities , and could correspond to ( part of ) the widespread disturbances observed in galaxies of the local universe . in particular , shocked hot gas should be seen at the galactic center ( within @xmath51 pc ) , possibly not resolved ; this would be a certain sign of prior agn activity .",
    "these hot bubbles could be revealed by emission of cosmic - rays , in a structure similar to a gigantic supernova remnant .",
    "preliminary results from 2d runs show bipolar nuclear outflows , that should be seen as conical cavities extending from the galactic center , and may be called jet - like features .",
    "\\6 ) the duty - cycle of nuclear activity is of the order of a few @xmath221 , depending on the assumed mechanical feedback efficiency ; in general , a burst cycle lasts for @xmath2 yrs .",
    "these duty - cycle values are broadly consistent with the fraction of active galaxies measured in observational works , though reported values for the local universe are somewhat lower , for the mbh mass of the models . in order to make a more consistent comparison with observations ,",
    "the dataset of models should be increased , and the duty cycle computed only for the last 23 gyrs ; this will reduce the duty cycle , as the models are characterized by a declining nuclear activity .",
    "\\7 ) the duty - cycle of perturbances in the ism is of the order of 5 - 10% , from their average number and duration .",
    "this duty - cycle likely increases with galaxy mass , because an outburst has a greater impact in less massive ( and less gas - rich ) systems , which then are `` on '' for a shorter time ( ciotti & ostriker 2011 ) .",
    "the ism duty - cycle , and its trend with galaxy mass , compare reasonably well with preliminary estimates obtained from a large sample of hot gas coronae in elliptical galaxies observed with @xmath18 ( nulsen et al .",
    "2009 ) : the fraction of galaxies with x - ray cavities in the hot gas is @xmath222% when @xmath223 erg s@xmath12 ( as for the models ) , and reaches @xmath224% in the most luminous ones .",
    "the presence of cavities has been attributed to the action of jets inflating radio lobes and displacing the surrounding gas .",
    "cavities can also be created in the scenario presented here , as hinted for by 2d simulations , due to bipolar nuclear outflows .",
    "\\7 ) two diagnostic planes have been constructed . in the first one ,",
    "the nuclear luminosity @xmath48 and the ism luminosity @xmath4 are followed during the whole model evolution .",
    "the points representative of the models populate a wedge region , that should then be occupied when observing a large set of galaxies .",
    "another plane shows the evolution of @xmath4 versus the average gas temperature @xmath164 ; here the most populated region is that of a large @xmath4 variation ( factor of @xmath0 ) for @xmath164 keeping between 0.4 and 0.6 kev .",
    "clearly , a larger set of models is to be explored , in order to better establish the final gas properties ( as gas content , nuclear and ism duty - cycle , etc . ) to be compared with those of a statistically large sample .",
    "for example , a general expectation is that changes of the galaxy properties have an impact on the number of nuclear outbursts : depending on many model parameters ( supernova rate , central @xmath76 , dark matter amount and distribution , and even external pressure due to an intragroup or intracluster medium ) , bursts could take place even towards the present epoch , or be confined to the early epoch ( ciotti & ostriker 2011 ) .",

    "the larger number of bursts shown by , their larger temporal extension and substructure , are due to the reduced peak value of mechanical efficiency @xmath44 of the agn wind ( see sect .  [ repmod ] ) .",
