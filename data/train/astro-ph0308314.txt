    "the ratio of total to selective extinction , @xmath9=@xmath5/@xmath6 , is a measure of wavelength dependence of the interstellar extinction , representing the shape of the extinction curve .",
    "@xmath9 is an important parameter to characterize dust properties at optical wavelengths because it is closely related to the size and composition of dust grains ( e.g. , mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ; hong & greenberg 1978 ; kim , martin , & hendry 1994 ) .",
    "it is well established that @xmath9 has a uniform value of @xmath113.1 in the diffuse interstellar medium ( e.g. , whittet 1992 ) , but it tends to be much higher in dense molecular clouds ( @xmath9=4@xmath126 ; e.g. , vrba , coyne , & tapia 1993 ; strafella et al .",
    "many theoretical predictions attribute the higher @xmath9 in the dense cloud interior to a significant change of dust properties , particularly in size ( e.g. , mathis 1990 ; ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) .",
    "since the timescale of grain growth due to coagulation of smaller grains and/or accretion of molecules in the gas phase onto the larger grain surface depends greatly on density ( e.g. , tielens 1989 ) , the higher @xmath9-values observed in dense molecular clouds are most likely to represent the growth of dust grains .",
    "there have been a number of observational reports on @xmath9 measurements to date ( e.g. , larson et al .",
    "2000 ; whittet et al .",
    "however , they are mostly based on the spectrophotometry of a limited number of stars lying in the background of the clouds , and the @xmath9-values have been measured only toward the selected stars . a large - scale distribution of @xmath9 over an entire cloud , as well as its local variation inside , are therefore still poorly known .    in order to investigate how much @xmath9 can vary in a single cloud ,",
    "we have carried out imaging observations of l1251 at multiple wavelengths , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , using the 105 cm schmidt telescope at the kiso observatory , japan .",
    "this cloud is located in the cepheus flare ( @xmath13@xmath11@xmath14 , @xmath15@xmath11@xmath16 ; j2000.0 ) and has an elongated shape .",
    "since l1251 is an isolated dark cloud located at a relatively high galactic latitude ( @xmath11@xmath17 ) , it is expected that the cloud is free from contamination due to unrelated clouds in the same line of sight .",
    "kun & prusti ( 1993 ) estimated its distance to be 300@xmath1850 pc with a color excess measurement and spectral classification of stars .",
    "they also found 12 h@xmath19 emission - line stars at the eastern part of the cloud , five of which are detected as @xmath20 point sources .",
    "global molecular distribution of the cloud was first revealed by sato & fukui ( 1989 ) and sato et al .",
    "( 1994 ) through @xmath21co and c@xmath22o ( @xmath23=1@xmath120 ) observations carried out with the 4 m radio telescope at the nagoya university ( hpbw=2.@xmath247 ) .",
    "their observations clearly revealed the cometary  head - tail \" morphology of l1251 .",
    "they also found that two of the @xmath20 point sources located in the eastern  head \" part of the cloud are associated with molecular outflows , while no sign of ongoing star formation was found in the western  tail . \" these characteristics of l1251 make this cloud a suitable site to investigate the possible difference in the dust properties ( e.g. , @xmath9 ) between star - forming and non - star - forming regions in a single cloud .    in this paper , we report results of the @xmath25 observations toward l1251 .",
    "the observational procedures are described in @xmath26 2 .",
    "the distribution of extinction ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and color excess at each band ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) are derived from the obtained data , which reveal the global dust distribution of the cloud .",
    "these are shown in @xmath27 3 and 4 .",
    "we also derive @xmath9 distribution over the cloud on the basis of color excess measurements and an empirical relation between @xmath9 and @xmath10/@xmath5 ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "a significant difference has been found in @xmath9 distribution between the dense head and the relatively diffuse tail of the cloud , suggesting a larger dust size in the dense head than in the tail .",
    "we introduce our procedure to create @xmath9 map and compare the obtained @xmath9 distribution with the other data in @xmath26 5 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in @xmath26 6 .",
    "we carried out imaging observations of l1251 from 2000 november 27 to december 2 using the 105 cm schmidt telescope equipped with the 2kccd camera at the kiso observatory .",

    "the typical seeing was 3.@xmath300@xmath124.@xmath305 during the observations . in total , we obtained 10 frames per filter , covering the entire extent of the cloud .    to calibrate the images , we obtained dome flat frames in the beginning of the observations and frequently obtained bias frames during the observations . in addition , we observed some sets of standard stars listed by landolt ( 1992 ) to correct the atmospheric extinction and calibration .",
    "we processed the calibrated images in a standard way using the iraf packages . after replacing values at the defected pixels in the detector ( i.e. , dead pixels ) by those interpolated using surrounding pixels",
    ", we applied the stellar photometry package daophot ( stetson 1987 ) to the images to detect stars and then to make photometric measurements . to improve the photometry we further measured the instrumental magnitudes of the detected stars by fitting a point - spread function ( psf ) and then calibrated them for the atmospheric extinction . among all of the detected stars we selected the ones having an intensity greater than @xmath33 @xmath34 noise level of the sky background .",
    "some false detection , however , could not be completely ruled out , which we later removed by eye inspection .    for calculating the plate solution ,",
    "we compared the pixel coordinates of a number of the detected stars with the celestial coordinates of their counterparts in the digitized sky survey ( dss ) , which resulted in a positional error of less than 1@xmath30 ( rms ) .",
    "all of the stars detected in our observations were summarized separately with respect to the filters we used ( @xmath25 ) , which we will adopt to generate an extinction map using a star count method .",
    "the limiting magnitudes are 20.0 , 19.7 , 19.0 , and 18.3 mag for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 bands , respectively . among all of the identified stars",
    "@xmath1133,000 were detected in all of the four bands .",
    "these stars are useful for probing the distribution of the color excess in the cloud .",
    "we converted the instrumental magnitudes of these stars into the magnitudes in the standard johnson - cousins photometric system ( johnson & morgan 1953 ; cousins 1976 ) , and we also measured their colors ( @xmath0@xmath12@xmath1 , @xmath1@xmath12@xmath2 , and @xmath1@xmath12@xmath3 ) .",
    "for the color excess measurements , we constructed a @xmath25-matched star list for @xmath1130,600 stars whose photometric errors in the color measurements , @xmath35 , are less than 0.15 mag .",
    "one should note that we excluded all of the known young stellar objects ( sato & fukui 1989 ; sato et al.1994 ; kun & prusti 1993 ) cross - identified in our photometries in order to avoid errors in the following analyses since they are unrelated to the global extinction in l1251 .",
    "on the basis of the stars detected in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 band , we derived extinction ( i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) maps of l1251 using a star count method . given a cumulative stellar density in the extinction - free reference field @xmath36 as a function of the @xmath37-band magnitude @xmath38 ( i.e. , the wolf diagram ; wolf 1923 ) , a logarithmic cumulative stellar density log @xmath39 measured at the threshold magnitude @xmath40 can be converted into the extinction @xmath10 as @xmath41\\hspace{2mm},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the galactic coordinates , and @xmath44 is the inverse function of @xmath45 defined as log @xmath36 = @xmath46 .",

    "we then smoothed the stellar density map to a 6@xmath24 resolution with gaussian filtering for a better signal - to - noise ratio to produce the final stellar density map @xmath52 , which we adopted to derive the @xmath4 and @xmath5 distribution .",

    "however , a similar change of dust properties most likely representing a large dust size in molecular clouds was recently reported through submillimeter observations of the dust emission ( e.g. , mcld123.5@xmath9924.9 : bernard et al .",
    "1999 ; taurus : stepnik et al .",
    "the idea of grain growth is also supported by their study based on the optically much thinner submillimeter observation , implying that dust grains with a larger size than in the diffuse ism may be common in dense molecular clouds .",
    "our procedure to derive the @xmath9 distribution on the basis of the average color excess measurements is useful to investigate a large - scale variation of the dust optical properties",
    ". it may be applicable also to the near infrared data in the future , with which we should be able to measure the @xmath9 distribution in the densest region of l1251 to confirm the significant change of @xmath9 therein .",
    "we have carried out optical observations toward l1251 at multiple bands , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , using the 105 cm schmidt telescope equipped with the 2kccd camera at the kiso observatory in japan .",
    "extinction and color excess maps of the cloud were derived using a star count method and a nice method . from the observed @xmath77@xmath85@xmath6 ( @xmath37@xmath55@xmath2,@xmath3 )",
    ", we also derived the @xmath9 distribution using an empirical @xmath9 versus @xmath10@xmath85@xmath5 relation ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "\\(1 ) we investigated the color excess distribution of the cloud on the basis of the @xmath1130,600 stars detected in our observations .",
    "color excess diagram , @xmath6 versus @xmath8 , indicates a significant difference in @xmath9 between the star - forming dense head ( @xmath42@xmath64114.@xmath82@xmath832 ) and the non - star - forming diffuse tail ( @xmath42@xmath84114.@xmath82@xmath832 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) we derived the @xmath9 distribution over the cloud on the basis of the color excess measurements and an empirical relation between @xmath9 and @xmath10@xmath85@xmath5 ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) . from the resulting @xmath9 map we found that @xmath9 is systematically higher in the dense head ( @xmath9@xmath554@xmath126 ) than in the diffuse tail ( @xmath9@xmath113.2 ) , which is consistent with what we found in the @xmath6 versus @xmath8 diagram .",
    "we confirmed the validity of color - excess - based @xmath9 measurements by comparing them with independently measured @xmath9-values ; i.e. , @xmath5@xmath85(@xmath4@xmath12@xmath5 ) , which were directly computed using @xmath4 and @xmath5 data from star count analysis .",
    "local peaks of the @xmath9 distribution in the head of l1251 coincide with the positions of the young stars accompanied by molecular outflows and the molecular cloud cores identified in c@xmath22o .",
    "we also found that @xmath9 increases with increasing @xmath5 in the dense star - forming head , while @xmath9 is likely to be independent of @xmath5 in the diffuse tail .",
    "since @xmath9 is closely related to the size of dusts , we suggest that these results are indicative of the growth of dust grains in the dense head due to coagulation and accretion of smaller dust particles and molecules onto the larger dust grains .",
    "we are very grateful to m. tamura , k. tatematsu , and t. mizuno for their helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "thanks are due to the staff at kiso observatory including k. nakada , t. miyata , t. soyano , k. tarusawa , y. tanaka , h. mito , t. aoki , n. ito , and s. nishiura for their kind support during the observations .",
    "this work was financially supported by the grant - in - aid for scientific research by the japanese ministry of education , science , sports and culture ( nos .",
    "13640233 and 14022214 ) .",
    "here we consider the degree of uncertainties caused by the presence of unknown faint pms stars in the star - forming head of l1251 , which escaped detection in the previous h@xmath19 survey ( kun & prusti 1993 ) .",
    "it is well known that a certain fraction of pms stars show the optical blue excess , which is prominent in @xmath107@xmath12@xmath0 ( e.g. , kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) and possibly in @xmath0@xmath12@xmath1 .",
    "their blue intrinsic color should result in an underestimate of @xmath6 , for which we may overestimate @xmath9 .    in order to examine the fraction of blue excess pms stars at @xmath0@xmath12@xmath1",
    ", we made a @xmath0@xmath12@xmath1 versus @xmath1@xmath12@xmath3 diagram of 96 pms stars in the taurus - auriga region ( see table a1 of kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) .",
    "we found 23 ( @xmath1125@xmath108 ) sources show a blue excess of greater than 0.2 mag compared with the main - sequence stars , while the rest of the sources have a similar color to the main - sequence stars with some reddening .",
    "if we assume that the ratio of the blue excess pms stars measured in the taurus - auriga region is also valid in l1251 , only two to three stars ( 25@xmath108 of @xmath39@xmath5510 ) in each counting cell are expected to be blue excess pms stars even in an extreme case that all of the stars detected in our observations are pms stars .",
    "however , at the maximum estimate of the blue excess pms stars ( about two to three stars per cell ) , there might be an influence on the value of @xmath6 calculated as the average color of 10 stars ( eq . [ 4 ] ) .",
    "we therefore recalculated @xmath6 taking the median color of 10 stars instead of the average , because it should be much less affected by a few blue excess pms stars .",
    "we compared the two values of @xmath6 , the median and the average colors of 10 stars , and found that they are quite consistent with each other even in the densest head of l1251 with a typical difference of only @xmath110.02 mag .",
    "this means that the possible error in @xmath9 due to the blue excess pms stars is negligible , and the high @xmath9-value derived in the star - forming dense head is most likely to be real .",
