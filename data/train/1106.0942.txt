    "to explore the range in the properties of mysos associated with extended 4.5@xmath0 m shock emission , the sample includes five egos with compact hii regions , as well as two non - egos for comparison ( an irdc and a uchii region ) . in this paper , we present the first results from the survey by describing the observations of one source in detail : g35.03@xmath70.35 ( hereafter , g35.03 ) . to show the location of dust emission with respect to the centimeter emission , we include complementary 1.3  mm submillimeter array ( sma ) observations .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig1]a , we detect three major regions of nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) emission : ( i ) the strongest emission is coincident with the central region of the bipolar 4.5 @xmath0 m nebulosity , the five centimeter continuum sources described in  1.1 , and 6.7  ghz ch@xmath1oh masers ; ( ii ) a slightly weaker and more compact core coincident with the sw lobe of the bipolar 4.5 @xmath0 m nebulosity ; and ( iii ) a weak but extended core coincident with the irdc @xmath22 sw of the ego .",

    "overall , there is strong agreement between the nh@xmath1 and 1.3  mm continuum emission .",
    "the strongest 1.3  mm emission arises from the ne core , coincident with cm1 and cm2 .",
    "though it is difficult to quantify the free - free vs. dust contributions at 1.3  mm due to the mismatch in the continuum resolution ( and @xmath27coverage ) between the sma , vla , and evla ( not shown ) , it is clear that a significant fraction must be due to dust .",
    "the morphology of the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) emission ( see fig .",

    "millimeter continuum emission is also visible to the east - se of the ne - core that partially coincides with the arc of 44  ghz ch@xmath1oh masers , and mimics the morphology of the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) integrated intensity .",
    "the sw nh@xmath1 core also has a 1.3  mm counterpart .",
    "the `` dark '' ammonia core was not detected by the sma , probably due to the smaller primary beam of these data .",
    "figure  [ fig2]c gives a detailed comparison of the nh@xmath1 ( 1,1 ) , ( 3,3 ) , and ( 6,6 ) integrated intensities .",
    "significant ( 3,3 ) emission is detected toward both the ne and sw core regions , though the strongest emission is compact and located east of the ego , toward the se terminus of the 44  ghz maser arc .",
    "interestingly , this region shows only weak para - nh@xmath1 emission suggesting a non - thermal origin for the ( 3,3 ) emission , though it appears to be connected to cm2 through a weaker ridge of warm thermal nh@xmath1 emission .",
    "the ( 6,6 ) transition is also detected at the ( 3,3 ) peak , as well as toward the candidate hc  hii region cm2 .",
    "we also detect strong , spatially - unresolved emission in the ch@xmath1oh  @xmath28 and @xmath29 lines at two distinct positions ( fig .",

    "the h63@xmath47 and h64@xmath47 recombination lines were detected toward the cm1 uc  hii region at a peak velocity of 55.9 km  s@xmath10 . following the method of @xcite , we use the line - to - continuum intensity ratio of 0.46 , the fitted fwhm linewidth of 17.6 km  s@xmath10 , and the diameter of cm1 determined from the evla 1.3  cm continuum ( @xmath48 ) to derive an electron temperature of 7900  k and density of @xmath49 @xmath50 .      over the last few decades",
    "considerable progress has been made in understanding the excitation of the nh@xmath1 molecule under astrophysical conditions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example in cold regions , analysis of the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions has evolved toward simultaneous least squares - fitting of the line profiles  freeing the analysis from previous failures wherever the intensity of ( 2,2 ) rivals ( 1,1 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . however",
    ", this type of analysis typically assumes that the kinetic temperature is much less than the energy gap between levels ( 41.5 k ) such that only the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) rotational levels are populated . due to these assumptions",
    ", this technique becomes less accurate above temperatures of about 30  k. generic molecular modeling packages exist that can be used to model nh@xmath1 emission from higher lying transitions using either radiative transfer with collisional excitation , or assuming lte .",
    "however , no package currently combines separate ortho and para collision rates ( with realistic collision partners ) with the detailed hyperfine structure of nh@xmath1 and a partition function that includes all relevant states that may be excited in warm gas ( though we can expect this situation to improve in the near future ) .    for the current preliminary analysis",
    "we have pursued the following course : ( 1 ) in the colder regions of g35.03 we have fit simultaneously the full hyperfine structure of the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines using a non - linear , least squares gaussian fitting routine given a single common line - of sight - velocity , line width , excitation , and kinetic temperatures in idl @xcite ; ( 2 ) in the warmer , and coincidentally more kinematically complex regions we have used the lte method in the cassis package to model all six observed nh@xmath1 transitions , including multiple velocity components where necessary . to compare methods , we also fit the cooler regions with cassis .",
    "figure  [ fig3]a shows the results from technique ( 1 ) , with grey areas indicating where this method s assumptions are invalid .",
    "the fitted parameters for both techniques toward several representative positions are given in table  [ fits ] .",
    "the corresponding spectral line fits for these positions using technique ( 2 ) are shown in figure  [ fig3]d - h .    as shown in table",

    "both methods do a reasonable job here , with method ( 2 ) predicting about twice the total column density of ( 1 ) , likely due to its more complete partition function . toward the center of the ne",
    "core and along the 44  ghz maser arc , technique ( 1 ) breaks down for two reasons : ( i ) the gas is warm ( @xmath51 k ) throughout this region ( or even non - thermal ; fig .  [ fig3]b ) and",
    "( ii ) the lines become more kinematically complex with at least two distinct velocity components separated by about 1.7 km  s@xmath10 , or in the case of cm2 what appears to be a significantly blueshifted hot ( 220 k ) outflow component . towards cm1 , the redder velocity component shows temperatures as high as @xmath52 k.      the average column densities and masses of the ne and sw cores based on the methodology described in ( * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the sources in the sample exhibit a broad range of massive star formation signposts including infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) , uchii regions , and extended 4.5@xmath0 m  emission in the form of extended green objects ( egos ) . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we present results for g35.03 + 0.35 which exhibits all of these phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we simultaneously image the 1.3  cm nh@xmath1  ( 1,1 ) through ( 6,6 ) inversion lines , four ch@xmath1oh  transitions , two h recombination lines , plus continuum at 0.05  pc resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we find three areas of thermal nh@xmath1  emission , two within the ego ( designated the ne and sw cores ) and one toward an adjacent irdc . </S>",
    "<S> the ne core contains an uchii  region ( cm1 ) and a candidate hchii  region ( cm2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a region of non - thermal , likely masing nh@xmath1 ( 3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) emission is coincident with an arc of 44 ghz ch@xmath1oh  masers . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect two new 25  ghz class i ch@xmath1oh masers . a complementary submillimeter array 1.3  mm continuum image shows that the distribution of dust emission is similar to the lower - lying nh@xmath1 lines , all peaking to the nw of cm2 , indicating the likely presence of an additional myso in this protocluster . </S>",
    "<S> by modeling the nh@xmath1 and 1.3  mm continuum data , we obtain gas temperatures of 20 - 220 k and masses of 20 - 130 m@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the diversity of continuum emission properties and gas temperatures suggest that objects in a range of evolutionary states exist concurrently in this protocluster . </S>"
