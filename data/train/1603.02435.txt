    "bose - einstein condensation is the well - known quantum phenomenon that occurs in a large many - body system of identical bosons when a macroscopic number of particles occupy the same one - body state .",
    "it can be thought of as a crowding phenomenon where the many - body state is for a large part factorised into the product of identical copies of the same one - body orbital , the condensate wave - function .",
    "the mathematics of the bose gas and its condensation is an extraordinarily rich and active subject that dates back from the very first systematic treatment of bogolubov in the mid 1940 s ( that is , some 20 years after the theoretical discovery of bec ) , boosted recently by the first experimental realisations of condensates in the mid 1990 s and the subsequent advances in the techniques for manipulating ultra - cold atoms .",
    "the literature is therefore huge : we refer to the monograph @xcite for what concerns the `` static '' picture ( emergence of bec , characterisation of the ground state , etc . ) and to the works we will be mentioning in the following and to the references therein for the `` dynamical '' picture ( the condensate s evolution ) .",
    "let us only recall here a few main and well - known points in order to formulate our problem .",
    "let us consider the hilbert space @xmath0 for a quantum particle of spin @xmath1 confined in a domain @xmath2 ( possibly @xmath3 itself ) and , correspondingly , for a @xmath4-dimensional ( bosonic ) system of @xmath5 such particles , let us consider the hilbert spaces @xmath6 namely the @xmath5-fold and the _ symmetric _ @xmath5-fold tensor product of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 , a positive trace - class operator on @xmath9 with unit trace , be the density matrix describing a state of a given bosonic system .",
    "consistently with the physical notion of `` occupation numbers '' , the standard mathematical tool to express the occurrence of bec when the system is in the state @xmath8 is the so - called one - body marginal ( or one - body reduced density matrix ) @xmath10 here , the map @xmath11 is the _ partial trace _ from trace class operators on @xmath12 to trace class operators on @xmath7 , defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath15 .",
    "observe that is in fact independent of the choice of the basis and is equivalent to @xmath16 thus , @xmath17 is obtained by `` tracing out '' @xmath18 degrees of freedom from @xmath8 : for example , for a system of @xmath5 spinless ( @xmath19 ) bosons in the pure state @xmath20 ( @xmath21 the wave - functions that are symmetric under permutation of any two variables ) , the corresponding one - body marginal @xmath17 has kernel @xmath22    being a density matrix , the one - body marginal @xmath17 has a complete set of real non - negative eigenvalues that sum up to 1 , and being it the partial trace of a many - body state @xmath8 , it is natural to think of these eigenvalues as the occupation numbers in @xmath8 , that is , each eigenvalue of @xmath17 can be interpreted as the fraction of the @xmath5 particles that are in the same one - body state given by eigenvector associated with the considered eigenvalue .    in a sense to be specified in the given context",
    ", one therefore says that the many - body state @xmath8 exhibits _ condensation in the state _",
    "@xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) if @xmath25 is an eigenvector of @xmath17 that belongs to a non - degenerate eigenvalue that is by far larger than all other eigenvalues , i.e. , it is almost 1 while all other eigenvalues are almost zero . in other words , @xmath26 , the rank - one projection onto @xmath25 .",
    "this notion of condensation becomes conceptually well - posed and mathematically rigorous in the limit @xmath27  a genuine thermodynamic limit , or some simpler prescription on @xmath27 that mimics the thermodynamic limit .",
    "for the present discussion we only consider the case of _ complete _ condensation , namely @xmath28 even if a priori the limit in can be stated in several inequivalent operator topologies , from the trace norm to the weak operator topology , the bounds @xmath29 ( see lemma [ lemma : intertwined - controls ] below ) show that the occurrence of the convergence @xmath30 can be monitored equivalently in any of them .    in @xmath25",
    "is customarily referred to as the _ condensate wave - function _ and in the presence of condensation the diagonal @xmath31 of the one - body marginal becomes , for large @xmath5 , a good approximation of the condensate profile @xmath32 . while the limit is naturally interpreted as if the many - body state was almost completely factorised as @xmath33 , the closeness @xmath26 is obviously much weaker than the actual closeness @xmath34 in the norm of @xmath12 .",
    "it can instead be argued that @xmath26 implies a factorisation of the many - body state when an amount @xmath35 of particles are considered : for the precise meaning of this control , as well as for equivalent characterisation of complete bec , we refer to @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) , as well as to the following considerations in section [ sec : indicators_of_convergence ] .    within this formalism ,",
    "the _ dynamical problem _ for the time evolution of a condensate is the problem of the persistence of bec , in the form of the asymptotic condition , along the evolution @xmath36 governed by a given many - body hamiltonian @xmath37 , and thus of the rigorous derivation of the law @xmath38 that gives the condensate wave - function at later times . whereas the solution to the schrdinger equation for a system of @xmath5 interacting particles is obviously out of reach",
    "when @xmath5 is large , both analytically and numerically , the language of the reduced density matrix boils down the dynamical problem to the level of one - body states , a major simplification in which one renounces to the complete knowledge of @xmath39 .",
    "the price is the replacement of the many - body _ linear _ dynamics for @xmath39 with an effective _ non - linear _",
    "dynamics for @xmath40 , the non - linearity being due to the inter - particle interaction and emerging in the form of a non - linear self - interaction term ( a cubic non - linearity , for typical two - body interactions ) in the non - linear schrdinger equation for @xmath40 .",
    "in shorts , the dynamical problem consists of the completion of the following diagram , assuming that the first line holds at time @xmath41 : @xmath42    there is a vast literature on the rigorous derivation of non - linear schrdinger equations as the effective equations for the dynamics of a many - body bose gas that at time @xmath41 displays the asymptotic factorisation .",
    "it covers different space dimensions ( @xmath43 ) , a wide range of local singularities and long - distance decays for the inter - particle interactions , and various types of scaling limits in the many - body hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "we refer to the reviews @xcite for a comprehensive outlook , remarking that this problem has involved a variety of approaches and techniques from analysis , operator theory , kinetic theory , and probability .",
    "let us emphasize that in the lack ( so far ) of a rigorous control of the asymptotics in a genuine thermodynamic limit , it is customary to investigate and reproduce it in an ad hoc scaling limit in which the @xmath5-body hamiltonian is suitably re - scaled with @xmath5 , thus making the actual inter - particle interaction @xmath5-dependent .",
    "this artifact on the one hand allows for an explicit determination of the limit @xmath27 in @xmath17 , while on the other hand it preserves at any @xmath5 an amount of relevant physical features of the system and of its hamiltonian , among which the property that kinetic and potential energy remain of the same order so that the interaction is still visible in the limit , as well as certain dilution properties of the system and short - range features of the interaction .",
    "typical relevant scaling limits are those in which the two - body potential @xmath44 that models the interaction among particles is replaced by a @xmath5-dependent two - body potential @xmath45\\ ] ] ( here @xmath46 is the relative coordinate between particle @xmath47 and particle @xmath48 ) .",
    "the regime @xmath49 is the mean - field regime , whereas @xmath50 gives the so - called gross - pitaevskii scaling regime .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an extended discussion .",
    "coming now to the problem we intend to study , let us mention that a large amount of theoretical and experimental studies in the dynamics of bose gases involve the interaction among two or more samples , each of which is in a condensate ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 12.11 ) and the references therein ) .",
    "these configurations are usually realised using atoms occupying different hyperfine states @xcite or also different atoms @xcite . in either case",
    "the particles of the two samples must be considered as different species and one then refers to such a system as a _ mixture _ of condensates . for mixtures",
    "one has the additional possibility of producing transitions between the two components , typically by applying an external oscillating magnetic field tuned close to the hyperfine splitting , which gives rise to a new variety of physical phenomena . in suitable circumstances",
    "condensation is robust enough to be preserved in time , each condensate keeping its own individuality , even in the presence of a significant transfer of atoms from one state to the other .",
    "physical arguments corroborated by experimental data show that to a very good approximation the effective dynamics of the mixture is described by a system of two coupled non - linear schrdinger equations , the coupling among them accounting for how each of the two condensates affect the evolution of the other .",
    "the rich variety of phases exhibited by the mixture is also well described in terms of the sign and the magnitude of the effective couplings appearing in the non - linear system ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 12.11 ) . in analogy to the rigorous derivation of the effective evolution equation from the quantum dynamics of a condensate , we are therefore interested in reproducing the _ effective evolution equations for the mixture dynamics_.    to this aim , we shall study a large three - dimensional system consisting of two distinguishable populations of identical bosons , with two - body interactions among particles of the same species and of different species .",
    "we also allow for the possibility of an external electro - magnetic field coupled with the particles , by means of a confining potential in case of a mixture in a trap or an external magnetic potential .",
    "we will assume that at time @xmath41 condensation occurs in both components and we will consider the quantum evolution of this mixture . as we shall discuss in sections",
    "[ sec : model ] , [ sec : indicators_of_convergence ] , and [ sec : mean - field - scaling ] , where the model will be set up , the appropriate language to formulate the assumption of condensation and to conveniently monitor the many - body dynamics is the generalisation of the notion of reduced density matrix for a bose gas with two distinguishable components .",
    "the effective dynamics will then emerge in a scheme that doubles in a suitable sense : this is our main result , presented in section [ sec : model ] .    on a more technical level , we find that several among the many alternative techniques developed so far for the ( one - component ) dynamical problem can be conveniently adapted to approach the multiple - component setting , with an amount of non - trivial modifications that depend on the considered techniques . in this work",
    "we employ a particularly robust and versatile method , invented and refined in a recent series of papers by p.  pickl @xcite , with the contribution of a.  knowles @xcite , which monitors how the displacement @xmath51 changes with time by means of an ad hoc `` counting '' of the amount of particles in the many - body state @xmath39 that occupy the one - body state @xmath40 .",
    "a number of tools and estimates that are crucial for this approach are reviewed in appendix [ sec : particle - counting_method ] .",
    "such a counting method has the virtue of being based on a few key algebraic steps that only involve the potential part of the hamiltonian , and the estimates that then follow do not concern the differential part of the operator . in section [ sec : main_proof ] , where we prove our main result , we discuss the non - trivial adaptation that we developed for pickl s method in the multi - component setting .    in order to access complementary aspects of the present analysis , in particular the very much relevant control of the fluctuations around the emergent effective dynamics , a parallel study by one of us in collaboration with g.  de oliveira @xcite is being developed within the fock space approach ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 3 and 4 ) , so that the two works are in fact part of a unified project .",
    "one last comment is about our treatment of the problem within the _ mean - field _ approximation .",
    "as our primary goal is to give evidence of the mechanism by which the many - body schrdinger dynamics of an initial mixture of condensates give rise to an effective dynamics of coupled non - linear equations for the persistence of condensation in each component , we found it instructive to place our discussion in the technically easiest framework , the mean field .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : mean - field - scaling ] , in order to derive the effective dynamics actually expected in a regime of almost zero temperature and high dilution one has to adopt the more realistic gross - pitaevskii scaling . given the high versatility of pickl s method , that has been proved to be successful also for the gross - pitaevskii scaling @xcite",
    ", the results of our multi - component analysis too can be proved to hold also for in such a ( technically more difficult ) scheme",
    ".    * notation . * essentially",
    "all the notation adopted here is standard , and we defer to subsection [ subsec : notation_for_the_proof ] the introduction of ad hoc extra notation for the proof of our main result .",
    "let us only emphasize the following .",
    "as customary , by `` @xmath52 '' we shall mean inequalities with a universal constant as an overall pre - factor , otherwise the dependence of the constants on other quantities of interest will be declared .",
    "scalar products and norms in the considered hilbert spaces will only be explicitly indexed whenever the underlying hilbert space is not evident from the context or when we want to emphasize it . in the same spirit",
    "we shall deal with the identity operator @xmath53 .",

    "when taking the trace of an operator , suitable subscripts will be occasionally added , such as @xmath57 or @xmath58 , in order to clarify the underlying hilbert space , while unambiguously symbols like @xmath59 will denote the partial trace map .",

    ": mean - field - scaling ] we will show that our choice in is _ the _ physically meaningful one , for it yields the physically correct effective dynamics .",
    "we also remark that @xmath127 , albeit not factorised ( unless @xmath126 ) , maps @xmath66 into itself , because of its permutation symmetry separately in each set of variables . therefore , given a density matrix @xmath77 on @xmath66 ,",
