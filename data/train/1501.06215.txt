    "the launch of the _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray space telescope in 2008 marked a revolution in pulsar @xmath0-ray astronomy ( for a recent review see * ? ? ? * ) . the large area telescope ( lat , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard _ fermi _ has detected tens of millisecond and young  to  middle - aged rotation - powered @xmath0-ray pulsars , with 117 listed in the second _ fermi _ lat catalog of @xmath0-ray pulsars ( 2pc , * ? ? ?",
    "this number has already risen to more than 160 .",
    "about 30% of the lat pulsars are radio - quiet . in the 2pc , radio - quiet ( rq )",
    "pulsars are defined as those that have not been detected in radio down to a flux density limit of s@xmath4jy at 1400 mhz , whereas radio - loud ( rl ) pulsars are those detected above this limit .",
    "some pulsars that have been detected in radio with a flux density below s@xmath4jy are defined radio faint ( rf ) .",
    "assuming that radio emission is produced close to the magnetic poles , this large fraction of rq @xmath0-ray pulsars suggests that the @xmath0-ray beam is broader and at a larger angle from the magnetic poles with respect to the radio beam ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , thus making its detection less sensitive to geometric effects .",
    "this piece of evidence has been crucial to verify the predictions of pulsar magnetospheric models , such as the outer gap and the polar gap ones @xcite .",
    "multi - wavelength studies of @xmath0-ray pulsars are key to map the geometry of the different emission regions in the pulsar magnetosphere , investigate possible connections between different emission processes , and study their efficiencies as a function of energy .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that the distribution of the @xmath0to  x - ray flux ratio @xmath5f@xmath6 is different for rl and rq pulsars , being narrower and peaking at higher values for the latter .",
    "what is behind the difference in the relative @xmath0 and x - ray efficiencies of these two classes of @xmath0-ray pulsars is not clear yet . while some clues are evident from the study of a handful of rq pulsars detected in x - rays ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , studying a larger sample allows one to explore differences across the parameter space .",
    "furthermore , the detection of rq @xmath0-ray pulsars in x - rays ( and in the optical ) can provide information , for instance , on the pulsar dynamics and distance , traditionally obtained in the radio band .",
    "in fact , for rl pulsars the measurement of the dispersion of the pulses at different radio frequencies allows one to estimate the free electron column density , from which the distance to the pulsar is obtained from a gas distribution model @xcite .",
    "alternatively , direct distance measurements for rl pulsars are obtained from the radio pulsar parallaxes .",

    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _",

    "the x - ray satellites that have yielded the highest pulsar detection rates have traditionally been _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _ due to their spatial , timing and spectral resolutions , along with their low background rates . here , we present the results of new follow - up observations of a sample of rq lat pulsars with no previous x - ray detections .",
    "our observations are summarized in section 2 , while our data analysis and results are described in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we compare the x and @xmath0-ray properties of all rq lat pulsars , making some considerations based on current models of @xmath0-ray and x - ray emission from pulsars .",
    "we selected our target pulsars for _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations among those rq lat pulsars that have no , or uncertain , detection in x - rays ( see table 5 of 2pc ) . in order to predict the non - thermal x - ray flux of these pulsars , we relied on the observed @xmath5f@xmath6 distribution of the rq pulsars family , favoring pulsars with relatively high @xmath0-ray flux and small pseudo - distance d@xmath2 , as inferred from the comparison between flux and luminosity of lat pulsars with known distance @xcite .",
    "our sample includes eight lat pulsars , spanning three orders of magnitude in characteristic ages ( @xmath7 , where p is the neutron star spin period and @xmath8 is derivative ) and two orders of magnitude in spindown energies ( @xmath9i@xmath10 , where the moment of inertia i is assumed to be 10@xmath11 g @xmath12 ) .",
    "their @xmath0-ray timing coordinates , which we used as a reference for the x - ray counterpart identification , and their timing parameters are summarized in table 1 , together with the values of the pseudo - distance d@xmath2 , as defined in @xcite .",
    "we took the pulsar timing parameters and the pseudo - distance values from the compilations in @xcite , whereas we took the @xmath0-ray timing positions and errors from the most recent compilation of the lat @xmath0-ray pulsar timing models .",
    "this compilation reports the results of the analysis of five years of _ fermi _ data by using a new , advanced timing analysis pipeline @xcite that handles glitch detection and fitting in the presence of timing noise much better than previous codes .",
    "we note that before this work , the positional errors based on @xmath0-ray timing were correctly calculated ( e.g. taking into account timing noise and systematic errors ) only for a small number of bright pulsars ( * ? ? ?",

    "three of these pulsars were also re - observed by _ suzaku _ : two of them ( psr j1429@xmath145911 and j1957 + 5033 ) remained undetected , also owing to the short exposure times , whereas a possible , marginal x - ray detection was obtained for psr j1838@xmath140537 .",

    "we observed psr j1838@xmath140537 with _ xmm - newton _  for 44 ks ( obs .",
    "i d 0720750201 ) using the epic ( european photon imaging camera ) pn and the two metal oxide semi - conductor ( mos ) cameras in the full frame mode with medium optical filters , due to the presence of moderately bright stars within their field  of  view ( fov ) .",
    "all the observations were carried out between 2012 september 16 and 2014 april 15 .",
    "for the _ chandra _  data analysis we used the _ chandra _  interactive analysis of observation ( ciao ) software version 4.3 .",
    "we re - calibrated our event data by using the chandra_repro script and selected events in the 0.310 kev energy range .",
    "depending on the total number of counts , we ran the wavdetect detection tool in different energy ranges , taking into account the exposure maps . for each pulsar , we found a single x - ray source within ( or close to ) the 95% @xmath0-ray timing error box , with a detection significance above 5@xmath15 and source counts varying from 12 ( psr j1846 + 0919 ) to 123 ( psr j1957 + 5033 ) .",
    "for each x - ray source we performed a spectral analysis .",
    "we extracted the source counts from a 2  circle radius around the x - ray position and the background counts from a surrounding annulus , whose radius we chose on a case by case basis in order to avoid contamination from serendipitous nearby sources .",
    "we used the ciao tool specextract to create the spectra , response matrix and effective area files and analyzed the spectra with xspec ( version 12.8.1 ) .",
    "we used the c - statistic @xcite , based on the application of the likelihood ratio and recommended for cases with low statistics and low background .",
    "as done in @xcite , we performed a brightness profile analysis on all x - ray sources , revealing no evidence for extended emission , with the exception of psr j2030 + 4415 ( see section 3.7 ) .",
    "for the analysis of the 44-ks xmm observation of psr j1838@xmath140537 , we used the _ xmm - newton _  science analysis software ( sas ) v13.0 .",
    "we performed a standard analysis of high particle background ( following * ? ? ? * ) and cross - checked the results with the sas tool bkgoptrate ( also used for the 3xmm source catalog ) , obtaining very good agreement .",
    "after the subtraction of bad time intervals affected by soft proton x - ray flares , we obtained a net exposure time of 23 ks .",
    "we selected 0 - 4 pattern events for pn and 0 - 12 for the mos detectors in the 0.310 kev energy range . from the cleaned events , we ran the source detection according to two different methods : we used the sas edetect - chain and the ciao wavdetect tools . both of them detected a single x - ray source within few arcsecs from the pulsar @xmath0-ray timing position",
    "the source appears point - like , with its brightness profile consistent with the detector s point spread function . in order to maximize the source signal  to  noise ( s / n ) , we extracted spectral counts from a 25  radius circular region around the computed x - ray position and the background from a source - free , nearby , 40   radius circle on the same ccd .",
    "we generated ad hoc response matrices and effective area files using the sas tools rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "to increase the statistics , we added the two mos spectra by using the heasoft tool mathpha and the two response matrices and effective area with addrmf and addarf .",
    "after background subtraction , we extracted 200 and 176 net source counts from the pn and the two mos , respectively .",
    "owing to the high background ( 64% and 43% of the extracted counts from the pn and mos , respectively ) , we used the @xmath16 statistic for the spectral fit .    due to the low statistics of our x - ray sources",
    ", we assumed the pulsar pseudo - distance @xmath17 to normalize the value of the integrated galactic n@xmath18 in the pulsar direction , computed according to the recalibration @xcite of the extinction maps from @xcite .",
    "four of our eight sources have fewer than 20 net counts , which are not adequate to perform detailed spectral fits .",
    "therefore , for these sources we fixed the power - law ( pl ) photon index and blackbody ( bb ) temperature to representative values of 2 and 200 ev , respectively . following , e.g. , @xcite , these are the fitted average of the values measured for pulsars detected in the x rays . errors in the spectral parameters are reported at the 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "the errors on the x - ray positions reported in the following sub - sections are purely statistical , at a @xmath19 confidence . to them , we have to add the 90% c.l .",
    "systematical errors associated with the absolute accuracy of the satellite aspect solution , which are 08 and 15 per coordinate for _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , respectively . according to the logn - logs distribution of _ chandra _",
    "galactic sources @xcite , we can estimate the probability of a chance detection of an x - ray source within a representative lat @xmath0-ray timing error box ( 1  @xmath20 , see figure [ i m a ] ) , with x - ray flux similar or greater than the measured ones , to be about 3@xmath2110@xmath22 .",

    "we separately highlighted in figure [ histo ] the log(f@xmath2/f@xmath3 ) values of the eight pulsars with the newly discovered x - ray counterparts ( table 2 ) , assuming a non - thermal x - ray spectrum for all of them .",
    "we fitted both rq and rl pulsar distributions with single and double gaussian models , taking into account poissonian errors .",
    "we confirmed that rq pulsars are intrinsically fainter in the x rays than the rl ones , with an average log(f@xmath2/f@xmath3 ) of 3.38@xmath240.10 ( @xmath108 error ) : at mean , radio - loud pulsars have f@xmath2/f@xmath3 values an order of magnitude lower ( see later ) .",
    "the distribution of the f@xmath2/f@xmath3 values for rq pulsars is well - fitted by a gaussian , with a null hypothesis probability of 0.62 , three degrees of freedom ( dof ) , featuring a sharp peak ( standard deviation of 0.43@xmath240.09 ) .",
    "this indicates very similar x- and @xmath0-ray emissions among the members of this family .",
    "the f@xmath2/f@xmath3 values computed for the eight rq pulsars with newly discovered counterparts ( table 2 ) are distributed around the peak , significantly increasing our statistics .",
    "we note that for four of the eight pulsars the x - ray spectrum could also be fitted by a single bb model , which would result in an even higher value of the corresponding f@xmath2/f@xmath3 .",
    "as noted from figure [ histo ] , the f@xmath2/f@xmath3 values of rl pulsars are characterized by a more structured distribution . while a single gaussian could fit the distribution , with an average log(f@xmath2/f@xmath3 ) of 2.24@xmath240.32 , the null hypothesis probability results quite low ( 0.05 , eight dof ) and the distribution is much wider , with a standard deviation of 0.72@xmath240.11 . by fitting the distribution with two gaussians ,",
    "we obtain two peaks at 1.81@xmath240.11 ( standard deviation of 0.29@xmath240.09 ) and 3.20@xmath240.14 ( standard deviation of 0.34@xmath240.05 ) , with the better null hypothesis probability of 0.38 ( five dof ) .",
    "an f - test @xcite shows that the probability for a chance improvement is 0.03 , not enough to exclude the single - gaussian fit .",
    "interestingly enough , the second peak of the f@xmath2/f@xmath3 distribution of rl pulsars would overlap the peak of the corresponding distribution for the rq pulsars .",
    "if statistically confirmed , this might suggest that the separation between rl and rq pulsars in the f@xmath2/f@xmath3 space might not be as clear as it was originally thought .",
    "at least partially , the overlap between the two peaks might be attributed to the subtle , and somehow arbitrary , distinction between radio - faint and radio - quiet pulsars .",
    "indeed , some rl pulsars with the highest f@xmath2/f@xmath3 values ( e.g. , j1741@xmath142054 and j1907 + 0602 , see figure 3 in the 2pc ) are radio - faint , whereas some rq pulsars with the lowest f@xmath2/f@xmath3 values , e.g. j1813@xmath141246 , are very distant and absorbed .",
    "thus , they would be undetected if they had a radio luminosity comparable to those of j1741@xmath142054 and j1907 + 0602 .",
    "in any case , we found no clear correlation between the radio flux and the x- and @xmath0-ray fluxes , which might have suggested that , e.g. radio - faint pulsars have higher f@xmath2/f@xmath3 values than the radio - bright ones .    in a similar way",
    ", we built the histogram of the photon indices ratio , @xmath109 , for rl and rq pulsars families ( figure [ histo2 ] ) .",
    "in both cases , the distributions are well fitted by a gaussian ( null hypothesis probabilities of 0.16 and 0.62 , 2 dof for rl and rq pulsars , respectively ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the peaks of both distributions occur at very similar values of the @xmath109 ratio , -0.09@xmath240.03 and -0.14@xmath240.08 for the rl and rq pulsars , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the peculiar distribution seen in the f@xmath2/f@xmath3 histogram ( figure [ histo ] ) is not produced by an intrinsic difference between the spectral slopes of the two families . in the following , we explore some implications of the observed bimodal f@xmath2/f@xmath110 distribution for rq and rl pulsars on pulsar emission models .",
    "pulsar magnetospheric radiation is highly anisotropic and a complex antenna pattern ( i.e. , the direction dependence of the emitting power ) results as the neutron star rotates and its beam sweeps the sky . in a specific energy range ,",
    "different emission models expect different antenna patterns  the emission mechanism , geometry and luminosity depend on the magnetic field configuration , inclination angle and intensity , as well as on the pulsar period , but the physics ruling such mechanisms is not yet understood . for a complete discussion",
    "see e.g. @xcite . constraining the multi - wavelength antenna patterns as a function of different pulsar properties would yield crucial clues to understand pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "the observed flux in a given energy range is a phase - averaged cut through the antenna pattern for the earth line of sight .",
    "a beaming factor @xmath111 is usually defined as the ratio of the observed flux to the average flux over @xmath112 sr ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in the radio range ,",
    "the antenna pattern is usually described with the @xmath85cone plus core@xmath85 heuristic model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "according to this model , then , the radio emission is centered on the magnetic axis ( in a co - rotating frame ) and radio loudness ( or , quietness ) is merely a fortuitous effect , set by our line of sight intercepting ( or , missing ) the radio antenna pattern of a pulsar , as a result of a small ( or , high ) magnetic impact angle .",
    "in other words , rq pulsars are simply those that are seen under a viewing angle substantially different from their magnetic inclination angle  the beaming factor for such lines of sight being essentially zero .    in the @xmath0-ray range , recent works based on data collected by the _ fermi_-lat ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed very complex antenna patterns , best described by outer magnetospheric models such as the outer gap @xcite or the two - pole caustic model @xcite . according to such models ,",
    "rq pulsars should not have , on average , a different @xmath0-ray beaming factor with respect to rl ones ( e.g. @xcite  indeed , beaming factors for rq pulsars are expected to be more dispersed than for rl pulsars ) . on the other hand , although distance estimates for rq pulsars are highly uncertain , there is no evidence for a larger luminosity ( nor for a larger spin - down conversion efficiency n@xmath113l@xmath114 , as defined in @xcite ) with respect to the rl ones , although some selection bias , related to highly pulsed @xmath0-ray signal and little timing noise easing blind periodicity searches in @xmath0-ray data , is certainly affecting our view of rq pulsars .    in the above picture , it is tempting to link the different f@xmath2/f@xmath110 distributions for rq and rl pulsars to differences in their x - ray emission properties , which could allow us to set first constraints on the poorly known x - ray antenna pattern . for the rq pulsars ( seen with large magnetic impact angle )",
    "the x - ray emission could possibly come from the outer magnetosphere , with an antenna pattern ( and a beaming factor ) possibly similar to the @xmath0-ray one .",
    "this could explain the narrow f@xmath2/f@xmath110 distribution for rq pulsars in spite of their expected large dispersion in @xmath0-ray beaming factors .",
    "focusing on the rl pulsars , about half of the sample has log@xmath115 , much lower than the average log@xmath116 for the rq pulsars .",
    "this could suggest the existence of a luminous x - ray emission component that can only be seen for small magnetic impact angles , and thus possibly centred on the magnetic axis . @xcite",
    "explained the peculiar multi - wavelength behavior of the rq pulsar j1813@xmath141246 by modeling its x - ray emission using a polar cap model @xcite : a low - altitude cone beam with peak emission just inside the polar cap rim .",
    "the radio beam , centred on the x - ray cone , is missed by just a few degrees : a slightly different line of sight would have made j1813@xmath141246 a bright radio pulsar .",
    "such an x - ray polar cap emission component should display a large variability in luminosity and/or beaming factor within the rl pulsar sample in order to account for the large dispersion in f@xmath117f@xmath6 .",
    "such a variability could be driven by other pulsar properties such as the spin - down - luminosity and/or the magnetic field configuration / intensity , as well as their evolution as a function of time .",
    "a major step forward in our understanding of the overall multi - wavelength emission geometry of pulsars could be obtained by performing simultaneous fitting of their multi - wavelength light curves .",
    "recently , @xcite have jointly fit @xmath0-ray and radio light curves with simulated @xmath0-ray and radio emission patterns .",
    "this allowed them to investigate some relations between observable characteristics and intrinsic pulsar parameters , encouraging the creation and testing of new models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also owing to the increasing number of rq pulsars , the above analysis should be extended to include x - ray light curves , taking into account both thermal and non - thermal pulsed emission .",
    "simultaneous fitting and phase - resolved spectral analysis of multi - wavelength emission of pulsars will allow us to test different emission models and to build new models for the overall emission , also better explaining the results presented in this paper .",
    "unfortunately , of the 28 rq lat pulsars now detected in the x - rays , only seven have been observed for a sufficiently long integration time to detect x - ray pulsations .",
    "similarly , of the 30 rl lat pulsars with an x - ray counterpart , only 15 are known to pulsate in the x - ray band .",
    "therefore , an important contribution to the theoretical analysis would come from the detection of x - ray pulsations for most of the brightest pulsars through deep follow - up _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  observations .",
    "while a number of much brighter rq and rl pulsars are better suited for such a future study , deep observations of _ xmm - newton _  , the best in - flight telescope to perform such a search , could allow us to detect pulsations from our eight pulsars . for instance , if we assume a lorentzian light curve with a duty cycle of 0.1 , with an entire orbit of xmm observation ( 130 ks ) we would detect pulsations at 5@xmath15 in case of a pulsed fraction of @xmath8640% for the brightest of our eight pulsars to 100% for the weakest one .",
    "we thank andrea belfiore ( `` mario '' ) for the useful discussions on the @xmath0-ray timing positions of lat pulsars .",
