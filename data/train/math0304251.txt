    "this paper is a continuation of the paper  @xcite by s.  lando and the author .",
    "here we use the same general framework and the same notations .",
    "in  @xcite we introduced hurwitz spaces @xmath0 and their projectivizations @xmath1 ( along the lines of  @xcite ) and the lyashko - looijenga map @xmath2 .",
    "we also described various strata in hurwitz spaces and proved several relations satisfied by the homology classes represented by these strata .",
    "the degree of the lyashko - looijenga map on each stratum and the corresponding hurwitz number were related to the coupling of the stratum with a power of a particular @xmath3-cohomology class @xmath4 .",
    "a _ stratum _ @xmath5 is described by a set of @xmath6 partitions of positive integers @xmath7 .",
    "a generic function lying in this stratum has @xmath6 critical values of multiplicities @xmath7 .",
    "the elements of the partitions correspond to the multiplicities of the critical points . in the sequel we often omit in the above notation the trivial partitions",
    "@xmath8 corresponding to simple critical points .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the degree of the @xmath2 map on the stratum @xmath10 .    a _ hurwitz number _",
    "@xmath11 is the number of ramified coverings with @xmath6 prescribed ramification points and ramification types @xmath12 , each covering being counted with weight @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the number of automorphisms of the covering ) .",
    "the precise relation formula obtained in  @xcite is the following : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dimension of the projectivized stratum @xmath17 .",
    "codimension @xmath18 strata have special names : the _ caustic _ @xmath19 and the _ maxwell stratum _ @xmath20 .",
    "we also use boundary strata @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( see  @xcite ) .      in the present paper",
    "we use the above results to derive recurrence relations ( expressed as partial differential equations on generating functions ) on some hurwitz numbers corresponding to certain strata in the hurwitz space .",
    "these relations have a meaning similar to the wdvv equation in quantum cohomology : intersecting a stratum with the boundary of the hurwitz space , we split the initial riemann sphere into several spheres with smaller numbers of marked points .",
    "these results are formulated in section  [ sec : recurrence ] .",
    "let @xmath23 be a stratum ( i.e. , the closure of the set of rational functions with prescribed multiplicities of critical points and values ) in the hurwitz space @xmath0 .",
    "we first study the intersection of @xmath23 with the boundary of the hurwitz space ( i.e. , with the set of stable rational functions defined on singular nodal curves ) .",
    "our main geometrical result is that the neighborhood of this intersection locally looks like a smaller hurwitz space ( theorem  [ thm : neighborhood ] ) . in particular , this allows us to find the multiplicity of the intersection .",
    "this investigation of the geometry of the hurwitz space is carried out in section  [ sec : int ] .    in section  [ sec : proofs ]",
    "we use the cohomological relations of  @xcite and the results of section  [ sec : int ] to prove the recurrence relations of section  [ sec : recurrence ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ y1y2 ] we give some explicit formulas for hurwitz numbers , resulting from our recurrence relations . here",
    "are some examples of these enumerative results .",
    "let @xmath24 be partitions such that the sum of all their elements equals @xmath25 .",
    "as above , @xmath11 is the corresponding hurwitz number .",
    "let @xmath26 be the partition @xmath3 and @xmath27 the partition @xmath28 .",
    "they correspond to critical values whose preimage contains , respectively , a unique double critical point or a unique triple critical point . in the notation below we omit the partition @xmath18 that corresponds to a simple ramification point .",
    "@xmath29    we have an algorithm that allows one to find similar formulas for other cases and a conjecture about the general form of the answer .",
    "we also prove that some generating series for the numbers of ramified coverings belong to a very special subalgebra of the algebra of formal power series and discuss the properties of this subalgebra .",
    "namely , fix @xmath6 points on the sphere and @xmath6 partitions @xmath24 of positive integers @xmath7 .",
    "denote by @xmath30 the number of the @xmath31-sheeted coverings of the sphere by a sphere , ramified over the @xmath6 points with ramification types @xmath32 and , in addition , having @xmath33 fixed simple ramification points .",
    "denote by @xmath34 the series @xmath35    [ thm : algebra ] the power series @xmath34 belongs to the algebra generated by the power series @xmath36    we believe that this subalgebra may play an important role in the combinatorial theory of ramified coverings of the sphere .",
    "the author is grateful to s.  lando for many useful discussions and for his remarks on the text . j .-",
    "bismut , d.  panov , and n.  markarian contributed to the work by their questions and helpful remarks .",
    "i also thank v.  arnold , a.  mednykh , a.  zorich and a.  zvonkin for their interest .",
    "here we write out recurrence relations for some hurwitz numbers .",
    "we introduce generating functions whose coefficients are these hurwitz numbers .",
    "the recurrence relations can then be expressed as partial differential equations with an infinite number of terms for each generating function .",
    "these relations are proved in the two following sections ( sections  [ sec : int ] and  [ sec : proofs ] ) .",
    "let @xmath37 be a stratum in @xmath0 .",
    "the main idea of the proof is to combine the expression @xmath38 for the hurwitz numbers ( theorems  3 and  4 in  @xcite ) and the expression @xmath39 for the cohomology class @xmath40 ( proposition  4.9 in  @xcite ) .",
    "from these two identities we deduce :    [ cor : recurrence ] @xmath41    the right - hand side of the last equality can be interpreted as a sum of degrees of the @xmath2 map on the subvarieties of the from @xmath42 .",
    "a point of this intersection is a meromorphic function defined on a curve with at least 2 irreducible components .",
    "we will see that it can happen that the curve actually consists of more than @xmath3 components , even for a generic point of the intersection .",
    "consider a particular irreducible component of the curve , and suppose that the restrictions of the stable meromorphic functions to this component are of degree @xmath43 .",
    "then these restrictions form a stratum in the space @xmath44 . knowing the degrees of the @xmath2 map on such strata for each component of the curve ( or , equivalently , the corresponding hurwitz numbers )",
    ", one can find the degree of @xmath2 on the intersection @xmath42 .    in order to be able to use this method ,",
    "we will restrict our attention to particular classes of strata @xmath23 , whose intersection with @xmath22 is not too difficult to understand .",
    "moreover , these classes must satisfy the following property .",
    "a class of strata @xmath23 is called _",
    "stable under intersection with @xmath45 _ if , for any @xmath46 , the restrictions of the functions @xmath47 to any given component of the nodal curve , form a stratum @xmath48 that belongs to the same class .    here is a list of several classes of strata stable under intersection with @xmath45 .",
    "the classes are described by properties that should be satisfied by a generic function of a stratum @xmath23 in order for @xmath23 to belong to the class .    1 .   all strata .",
    "all critical values ( and therefore all critical points ) are simple .",
    "3 .   all critical values are simple except maybe one .",
    "4 .   there is a critical point with the maximal possible multiplicity ( i.e. , multiplicity @xmath49 for functions of degree @xmath31 ) .",
    "the values at distinct critical points are distinct ( but the critical points can be multiple ) .",
    "the values at distinct critical points are distinct and the multiplicities of the critical points are equal to @xmath18 or @xmath3 .      in this subsection",
    "we consider ramified coverings with particular ramification types .",
    "namely , we consider rational functions @xmath50 such that the preimage under @xmath50 of every critical value of @xmath50 contains only one critical point .",
    "we introduce a generating function for the corresponding hurwitz numbers and write down a partial differential equation on this generating function .",
    "a closed formula for such hurwitz numbers is still unknown , but we have found many new formulas for particular cases .",
    "a stratum @xmath23 is called _ simple _ if for a generic function @xmath51 , every critical value of @xmath50 is attained at a unique ( possibly multiple ) critical point . in other words ,",
    "the set of partitions @xmath24 that describes the stratum @xmath23 ( see introduction ) contains only partitions consisting of a single element .",
    "the caustic is a simple stratum , while the maxwell stratum is not .    before proceeding we briefly",
    "describe the intersection of a simple stratum @xmath23 with @xmath22 .",
    "consider a function @xmath50 in the open part of @xmath23 that tends to a stable meromorphic function in the intersection @xmath42 .",
    "then , generically , two critical values of @xmath50 get glued together .",
    "the monodromies corresponding to these critical values are cyclic permutations ( i.e. , have only one cycle of length greater than  @xmath18 ) , because each critical value has a unique critical point in its preimage .",
    "when the critical values are glued together the monodromies are multiplied .",
    "the two cycles in the monodromies have @xmath52 elements in common and their product is a permutation with @xmath53 cycles .",
    "one can see that this implies that the rational curve splits into @xmath53 components on which the meromorphic function is not constant .",
    "if @xmath54 , there is one additional component , on which the function is a constant .",
    "the other @xmath53 components are glued to this additional one .",
    "the cases @xmath55 and @xmath56 do not interest us , because one can see that in these cases the rational curve does not split .",
    "we introduce the following notation for the simple strata .",
    "let @xmath57 be a monomial of degree @xmath25 in variables @xmath58 , the variable @xmath59 having degree @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 denote by @xmath62 the simple stratum such that a generic function @xmath63 has @xmath64 simple critical points , @xmath65 double critical points , ",

    "we are going to prove that the function @xmath72 satisfies a partial differential equation with an infinite number of terms . in order to describe the terms",
    "we introduce the notion of a decomposition list .",
    "to each decomposition list corresponds a term of the partial differential equation .",
    "[ def : admissible ] a list of non - negative numbers @xmath76 is called a _ decomposition list _ if it is possible for two cyclic permutations with cycles of lengths @xmath77 and @xmath78 to have a product with cycle lengths @xmath79 ,  , @xmath80 .",
    "more precisely , consider two permutations @xmath81 and @xmath82 that are cycles of lengths @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath81 and @xmath82 act on @xmath83 elements and their cycles have @xmath52 elements in common .",

    "goulden and jackson @xcite obtained by purely combinatorial methods a similar partial differential equation for a generating function that enumerates the same numbers .",
    "the idea of their method is as follows .",
    "the hurwitz number @xmath126 with @xmath137 is equal ( up to a simple combinatorial factor ) to the number of shortest possible transitive factorizations into transpositions of a given permutation @xmath138 whose cycles have lengths @xmath139 . multiplying the last transposition of the factorization by @xmath140 , we obtain a new permutation @xmath141 , which is again factorized into transpositions , but not necessarily transitively ( i.e. , the group generated by the transpositions may not be transitive ) . considering various possible cases one can express the number of shortest transitive factorizations for the initial stratum in terms of similar numbers for several other strata , which is then encoded in a partial differential equation on the generating function . from the algebro - geometric point of view",
    ", the case when the factorization of @xmath141 is not transitive corresponds to the situation when the curve of definition of the meromorphic function @xmath50 splits into 2 components .",
    "the case when the factorization of @xmath141 remains transitive corresponds to other possible degenerations .",
    "thus our equation is different from that of goulden and jackson in that we have managed to get rid of all the degenerations except the splitting of the rational curve .",
    "the price to pay is that our equation contains nontrivial coefficients coming from the algebraic geometry ( they are multiplicities of intersections of some strata ) .",
    "therefore we think that our equation can not be easily obtained by purely combinatorial methods .",

    "the proof goes in the spirit of  @xcite .",
    "the monodromy of a ramification point with ramification type @xmath403 is a permutation whose cycle lengths are @xmath404 and , in addition , some number of cycles of length  @xmath18 . for simplicity we will call @xmath151 the _ cycle type _ of the permutation . consider a factorization of the identity permutation on @xmath31 elements into a product of @xmath6 permutations @xmath405 with cycle types @xmath24 and @xmath406 transpositions @xmath407 ( in that order ) such that the group generated by all these permutations acts transitively on the @xmath31 elements .",
    "such a factorization is called a _",
    "transitive factorization_. it is easy to see that the number @xmath406 is the smallest possible number of transpositions that should be added to the other permutations so that a transitive factorization would exist .",
    "it follows that every transitive factorization is the set of monodromies of a ramified covering of a sphere by a sphere .",
    "moreover , the number of all transitive factorizations equals @xmath408 .    before proceeding with the proof ,",
    "let us give an example of what will happen .",
    "consider the generating function @xmath409 corresponding to the case when @xmath410 and the two special critical values are actually just simple critical values ; in other words , the corresponding monodromies are transpositions",
    ". a product of two transpositions can be either a cycle of length  3 ( corresponding to a double critical point ) , or a permutation with two cycles of lengths  2 ( a critical value attained at two simple critical points ) , or the identity permutation with two distinguished elements ( the ramified covering splits into two irreducible components that intersect at one point ) .",
    "therefore we will need three simpler generating functions : @xmath411 , @xmath412 , and @xmath413 ( the latter corresponds to the case @xmath414 ) .",
    "we have the following equality : @xmath415 the coefficient @xmath28 is due to the fact that there are _ three _ ways do decompose a cycle of length @xmath28 into a product of @xmath3 transpositions .",
    "similarly , the coefficient @xmath3 is due to the fact that a permutation with @xmath3 cycles of length  @xmath3 can be decomposed into a product of @xmath3 transpositions in _ two _ ways .",
    "the operator @xmath373 is applied to the function @xmath413 because if there are @xmath142 and @xmath143 sheets in the two transitivity components , then there are , respectively , @xmath142 and @xmath143 ways to choose their intersection point on each of the components ( and the operator @xmath373 multiplies by @xmath142 the coefficient of @xmath416 ) . finally , the coefficient @xmath254 is due to the fact that the two transitivity components are indistinguishable from each other .",
    "the reader can check that the equality is true using the expressions      we will show that similar relations hold in the general case .",
    "we do not need to specify the coefficients in these relations ; it suffices to know that they are some fixed rational numbers .",
    "now we proceed with the proof .",
    "let us see what happens to a transitive factorization as we multiply the permutations @xmath418 and @xmath419 .",
    "we obtain a new list of permutations , whose product is equal to the identity permutation .",
    "however the group generated by these permutations is not necessarily transitive .",
    "denote by @xmath53 the number of its transitivity components .",
    "each transitivity component is a subset of the set @xmath420 . for each component",
    "we actually obtain a transitive factorization of the identity permutation acting on this subset .",
    "the elements of each of the partitions @xmath421 are distributed among the transitivity components .",
    "the @xmath406 transpositions are also distributed among the transitivity components . as for the product @xmath422 , we will separate its cycles into two groups .",
    "the first group consists of those cycles that have at least one element in common with a cycle of length greater than  @xmath18 either in @xmath418 or in @xmath419 .",
    "the cycles in this first group can have length  @xmath18 ( singletons ) or greater than  @xmath18 .",
    "the cycles of length  @xmath18 will be called _ special _ singletons .",
    "the second group consists of all the other cycles .",
    "all these cycles are automatically singletons .",
    "if the number @xmath31 is big enough , the second group will be much bigger than the first one .",
    "the cycles of length greater than  @xmath18 and the special singletons of the product @xmath422 are again distributed in some way among the @xmath53 transitivity components .",
    "thus to every transitive factorization with cycle types @xmath24 we can assign unambiguously the following data : @xmath53 transitive factorizations acting on some subsets of the set @xmath154 ; each of these transitive factorizations is composed of @xmath401 permutations with some given cycle types , plus the necessary number of transpositions ; some number of special singletons is specified among the singletons of the @xmath423th permutation .    working backwards , one can see that the above data allows us to reconstruct several possible transitive factorizations with cycle types @xmath24 .",
    "the number of possibilities is equal to the product of two factors .",
    "the first factor is a multinomial coefficient that counts the number of ways to order the @xmath406 transpositions .",
    "these transpositions are already ordered inside each of the @xmath53 transitive factorizations , and we have to order them all respecting these partial orders . as we multiply two generating functions , this first factor appears automatically , because of the coefficient @xmath424 in the denominator of the coefficient of @xmath375 in @xmath34 .",
    "the second factor is the number of ways to reconstruct the permutations @xmath418 and @xmath419 knowing their product .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath423th permutations in the @xmath53 transitive factorizations can be regrouped into a unique permutation acting on the set @xmath154 .",
    "this permutation has some cycles of lengths greater than  @xmath18 and , in addition , a given number of special singletons .",
    "we must decompose this permutation into a product of two permutations @xmath418 and @xmath419 ( with given cycle types ) in such a way that all nonspecial singletons remain singletons in @xmath418 and @xmath419 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath53 subsets of the subdivision must merge into a unique transitivity component after we have replaced the product @xmath422 by two permutations @xmath418 and @xmath419 .",
    "the number of such factorizations is the second factor .",
    "this factor , divided by some product of factorials due to indistinguishable transitivity components , will play the role of the coefficient in the expression for @xmath34 .",
    "now we can precisely describe how the generating function @xmath34 is expressed from similar generating functions assigned to lists of @xmath401 partitions .",
    "first we make a list of all possible ways to divide the elements of each of the partitions @xmath425 into @xmath53 parts and to distribute among the same @xmath53 parts the cycle lengths and the special singletons of each possible product of the permutations @xmath418 and @xmath419 .",
    "this gives us a finite list of possibilities ; each possibility can be described by a table : @xmath426 here @xmath427 for @xmath428 is the partition formed by those elements of the partition @xmath32 that were assigned to the @xmath98th part ( empty partitions are allowed ) ; @xmath429 is the similar partition assigned to the restriction to the @xmath98th part of the product @xmath422 ; finally , @xmath430 is the number of special singletons in the @xmath98th part .    to each row of this table",
    "we assign the generating function corresponding to the partitions of this row .",
    "the coefficients of this generating function count the number of transitive factorizations in the corresponding transitivity component .",
