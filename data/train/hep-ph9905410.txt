    "the compton amplitudes can be analytically continued to the complex-@xmath13 plane .",

    "sufficiently fast as @xmath77 , we can write down the dispersion relations @xcite @xmath78 where we have used the crossing symmetry . using these relations , theoretical predictions of the compton amplitudes can be translated into dispersive sum rules for the structure functions .    one question often raised about the dispersion relations is their convergence at high - energy . on quite general grounds",
    ", one would argue that the above integrals converge .",
    "considering the real photon case , for instance , it is reasonable to expect the photoproduction cross sections to be spin - independent at high energy .",
    "the standard practice is to resort to regge phenomenology , which has actually never been tested thoroughly in spin - dependent and/or virtual photon scattering cases .",
    "according to the folklore , @xmath0 in the isovector channel behaves as @xmath79 at large @xmath13 , where @xmath80 is the regge intercept of the @xmath81 trajectory at @xmath82 ( forward scattering ) .",
    "since @xmath80 is believed to be somewhere between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the convergence of the integral is guaranteed . however , in the isoscalar channel the picture is not so clear .",
    "most of the studies so far favor a convergent integral @xcite .",
    "when the integrals do converge , there is still the insidious possibility that they do not converge to the compton amplitudes @xcite .",
    "such a possibility is quite remote in qcd given the accuracy of the experimental tests of the bjorken sum rule @xcite . as for the @xmath85 integral",
    ", convergence apparently happens for any reasonable regge behavior @xcite .",
    "of course , independent of the theoretical guesses , study of the high - energy behavior of the spin - dependent structure functions should be an important part of future experimental programs .",
    "however , in the remainder of the paper , we take it as a good working hypothesis that the above dispersion relations are valid without subtraction .",
    "as we have explained above , the dhg sum rule depends on two theoretical statements : the low - energy theorem for the spin - dependent amplitudes @xcite and unsubtracted dispersion relation for the relevant compton amplitude . although both are of a nonperturbative nature , it is interesting to consider them in the context of perturbation theory . in particular , since we are interested in the dhg sum rule for the nucleon , we would like to consider carefully its significance in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the low - energy theorem is related to electromagnetic gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "it is a nonperturbative result which is independent of the detailed dynamics of the bound state under consideration . using the notation introduced above",
    ", the low - energy theorem states that for a spin-1/2 target @xmath86 as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the object under consideration .",
    "the above result has interesting implications on the power series for @xmath87 if the structure of the target can be understood in perturbation theory .",
    "consider , for instance , @xmath87 for the electron in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "since @xmath88 , the leading contribution to @xmath87 must be of order @xmath89 .",
    "this means that all contributions to @xmath87 of order @xmath90 must add up to zero . indeed , if one computes @xmath87 explicitly from the four diagrams shown in fig . 1",
    ", one finds that all contributions add up to zero . at the next order ,",
    "one has many more diagrams .",
    "the sum of all the diagrams must add up to the square of schwinger s result .",
    "[ fig1 ]    [ fig2 ]    now we turn to chiral perturbation theory for the low energy structure of the nucleon . at leading order , the nucleon couples to photons through the following effect vertex , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon in the chiral limit .",
    "the nucleon - pole diagrams ( shown in fig .",
    "2 ) yield the following contribution to @xmath87 : @xmath93 comparing this with the low - energy theorem , one concludes that the leading chiral contributions to @xmath87 must sum to zero .",
    "[ fig3 ]    we consider the one - loop contributions @xmath87 in chiral perturbation theory shown in fig .",
    "3 . there are nine topologically distinct diagrams .",
    "all others can be obtained by switching the initial and final state nucleon or by exchanging the photons ( crossing symmetry ) .",
    "all of these diagrams contribute to @xmath87 , as shown in table 1 .",
    ".contributions to @xmath87 from the diagrams in fig .",
    "3 . all contributions have the common factor @xmath94 .",
    "we note that although the sum of each column is indeed zero , the cancellation is highly nontrivial . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that all diagrams without the attachment of a photon to the pion loop are ultraviolet divergent .",
    "however , all divergences cancel out .",
    "the sum of all contributions is indeed zero , as required by gauge - invariance .    when combining the low - energy theorem with the unsubtracted dispersion relation , one obtains the dhg sum rule .",
    "if one has a fundamental theory in which particles are pointlike , the dhg sum rule is correct order by order , and even diagram by diagram , in perturbation theory . in qed and the standard model of electroweak interactions , this result has been shown at leading order in perturbation theory @xcite . recently , brodsky and schmidt have generalized altarelli et al.s result for any @xmath95 process to supersymmetric and other quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "however , it must pointed out that in an effective theory where the particles have internal structure , the dhg sum rule can not be correct order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "indeed , recall the @xmath70-channel nucleon - pole diagram which contributes to @xmath87 .",
    "this digram does not have an imaginary part because elastic scattering is forbidden in this case by kinematics ( unless @xmath13 is strictly zero ) .",
    "however , it gives the entire low - energy - theorem result in the chiral limit .",
    "the unsubtracted dispersion relation clearly does not work for this diagram .",
    "an opposite example is the diagram with a @xmath96 pole .",
    "we will see in sec .",
    "vi that this diagram does not contribute to @xmath87 , but it completely dominates the dhg integral in the limit of a large number of color @xcite .",
    "again , we see that an unsubtracted dispersion relation fails for the diagram . in general , since the effective theory is only good at low - energy , it can not be used to calculate the photon absorption cross section at very high - energy , and hence one can not establish any dispersion relation between the real and imaginary parts of the compton amplitudes in the theory .    it is interesting to note here that a perturbative verification of the dhg sum rule in the context of quantum gravity can have implications about physics beyond the string compatification scale @xcite .",
    "as we have discussed above , the drell - hearn - gerasimov sum rule has its origin in the dispersion relation and the low - energy theorem for the compton amplitude @xmath87 . to extend the sum rule to virtual - photon scattering , we take @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ masterdis ] ) @xmath97 this would be a general @xmath5-dependent sum rule provided one knew how to extend the theoretical prediction for the compton amplitude @xmath32 beyond the low - energy theorem .",
    "we notice that the popular way to generalize the dhg sum rule in the literature has been to consider an integration over the spin - dependent virtual - photon - nucleon cross section ( referred to as the dhg integral ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , in some experimental publications , the data has been presented in this way @xcite . [ the model calculation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is an exception . ]",
    "the problem we have with this is that the virtual - photon cross section is not a well - defined quantity because the virtual - photon flux is convention - dependent .",
    "more importantly , in these types of proposals , no rule has been specified as to what the dhg integral should be equal to . if one does not have a rule for the sum , there is no point to study the sum .",
    "one can just as well study the individual contributions .",
    "the generalized dhg sum rule implied in eq .",
    "( [ extdhg ] ) is not only lorentz - invariant , but also exhibits clear physical significance : the integral gives rise to the virtual - photon compton amplitude @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath5 is very small compared with the nucleon mass , @xmath44 should be computable in chiral perturbation theory . in recent years ,",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath98pt ) has emerged as a powerful tool to go beyond the various low - energy theorems involving pions , photons , and nucleons @xcite . in this and the next two sections",
    ", we study the implications of @xmath98pt for the @xmath40 .",
    "we notice that a study of a generalized dhg sum rule via a dispersion relation in @xmath98pt has in fact been made in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , our view on the subject is significantly different and we will point out the differences towards the end of this section .    in this section , we are interested in the leading - order chiral perturbation theory prediction for @xmath32 .",
    "let us make an important point first .",
    "as soon as @xmath99 , the compton amplitude receives an a contribution from elastic scattering .",
    "this contribution can be calculated simply in terms of the dirac and pauli form factors of the nucleon @xmath100 this elastic contribution dominates at low @xmath5 due to the @xmath39 singularity .",
    "since the dhg sum rule has no elastic contribution due to the kinematic constraint , we consider a subtracted version of @xmath101 @xmath102 which then can be expanded around @xmath1 : @xmath103 in @xmath98pt , the coefficient @xmath104 can be expanded as a power series in pion mass : @xmath105 the leading chiral contribution comes from the @xmath106 term .",
    "we will calculate @xmath106 using heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath98pt ) in which one formally takes the nucleon mass to infinity @xcite .",
    "hb@xmath98pt is entirely equivalent to @xmath98pt using the fully relativistic propagators except that the former has a better way to organize different powers of the nucleon mass .",
    "there is , however , a subtle point in calculating @xmath32 due to the special kinematics .",
    "we will discuss this point in the next section .",
    "the leading chiral contribution comes from diagrams in which one of the two photons lands on a pion .",
    "this physically makes sense because in the chiral limit , the nucleon has a pion cloud extending far away from it and the leading scattering process is one in which the photon directly interacts with the pion . at one - loop order , only diagrams @xmath107 and @xmath51 of fig .",
    "3 contribute .",
    "however , when we add their contributions together , we get @xmath108 in other words , the leading chiral contribution vanishes . to understand this",
    ", we recall that in the heavy - baryon limit spin - dependent effects vanish like @xmath109 .",
    "this physical fact gives rise to the well - known heavy - quark symmetry in heavy - quark physics @xcite . in the present case",
    ", the symmetry implies that the leading chiral terms @xmath110 vanish in eq .",
    "( [ s1 t ] ) .",
    "our calculation confirms this .",
    "the above result has interesting phenomenological implications . at present",
    ", there is no direct data on the spin - dependent photo - production cross section , and therefore one can not make a direct test of the dgh sum rule . however , there is already data available for @xmath111 at low @xmath5 .",
    "the lowest @xmath5 of the data is around @xmath112 gev@xmath14 . at this point @xmath113",
    "differs from @xmath114 by a quantity of order @xmath115 . baring an anomalously large coefficient ,",
    "the correction is of only a few percent !    [ fig4 ]    what about contributions from the @xmath96-resonance ,",
    "whose mass is about @xmath116 larger than the nucleon mass ? in the large @xmath117 limit ,",
    "the @xmath96 is degenerate with the nucleon and clearly plays a very important role .",
    "thus , we need to get an idea how important the @xmath96 is in the real world .",
    "first of all , direct @xmath96 production , shown in fig .",
    "4a , gives a contribution of zero .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given the fact that the @xmath96 contributes dominantly on the dispersive side of the dhg sum rule .",
    "however , as we have mentioned before , one can not establish a dispersion relation in an effective theory on a diagram - by - diagram basis . at one loop level , we consider the diagrams shown in figs .",
    "our result shows that their contributions to @xmath44 again vanish in hb@xmath98pt , independent of the @xmath96-@xmath118-@xmath119 coupling constant and @xmath96 mass .",
    "we again expect this from the heavy - baryon spin symmetry .",
    "the above result strongly suggests a study of @xmath44 in chiral perturbation theory at the next order .",
    "this study is considerably more complicated and the result will be presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "a bonus of considering virtual - photon scattering is that one has the opportunity to study another compton amplitude , @xmath120 .",
    "since @xmath36 is odd in @xmath13 and also contains the elastic contribution , we consider a sum rule for the subtracted @xmath121 , @xmath122 taking into account the nucleon contribution , we get @xmath123 at leading order in @xmath109 .",
    "one might be puzzled why @xmath124 does not vanish in the heavy - nucleon limit as in the case of @xmath125 .",
    "the answer is that the natural energy scale for the heavy - nucleon system is @xmath109 . indeed",
    "if we take @xmath126 , @xmath127 does vanish as @xmath128 .",

    "the @xmath96 contribution to @xmath130 is less than 20% near @xmath1 .",
    "this means that as far as @xmath130 is concerned , the large-@xmath117 limit does not provide a good zeroth - order approximation .",
    "a generalization of the dhg sum rule in chiral perturbation theory was first investigated by bernard , kaiser , and meissner @xcite .",
    "the main point of that work is indeed very close to ours , i.e. , to get a generalization of the dhg sum rule through the study of the compton amplitudes .",
    "however , the details here differ from those in ref .",
    "@xcite in several important ways .",
    "first , we consider an integral which comes naturally out of a dispersion relation for the @xmath3 amplitude . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the integral is over the virtual - photon cross section with a special choice of flux factor .",
    "one in principle can consider a similar integral but with a different definition of flux factor .",
    "second , in the large-@xmath5 limit , the integral in ref .",
    "@xcite does not yield the bjorken sum rule . in our case ,",
    "the @xmath0 integral does . finally , ref .",
    "@xcite s extension of the dhg integral gives rise to the combination @xmath135 , which has a strong @xmath5-dependence .",
    "in leading - order @xmath98pt , this @xmath5-dependence comes entirely from @xmath136 .",
    "because of this , both sides of the generalized sum rule no longer vanish in the heavy - nucleon limit  a nice physical property of the dhg sum rule that we would like to keep at finite @xmath5 .",
    "this section contains a discussion about a technical point in the use of hb@xmath98pt .",
    "we will show that the formalism can be used in the special kinematic point @xmath35 if one sums over all singular contributions . for a general reader",
    ", this section can be skipped .",
    "the kinematics associated with the compton amplitudes @xmath138 are special because the virtual photon has no energy in the rest frame of the nucleon .",
    "thus it appears that one can not really use hb@xmath98pt in this kinematic region .",
    "consider , for instance , the nucleon - pole diagram , shown in fig .",
    "5a , in the fully relativistic formalism .",
    "it contains a contribution to the compton amplitude proportional to @xmath139 where the denominator of the nucleon propagator is @xmath140 we have used the kinematic condition that the nucleon is at rest and @xmath141 .",
    "thus the pole contribution goes like @xmath39 , which clearly can not be produced through any local vertex in heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the same problem exists for any one - particle reducible ( 1pr ) diagram with a single nucleon propagator in between the two electromagnetic vertices : the dominant contribution contains a similar @xmath39 piece which seems to be beyond hb@xmath98pt . for one - particle irreducible diagrams , on the other hand ,",
    "no such singularity exists and we have checked that the fully - relativistic expression reduces smoothly , in the heavy - nucleon limit , to feynman rules in hb@xmath98pt .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we focus on the 1pr diagrams and discuss how to treat them consistently in the heavy - nucleon limit .",
    "[ fig5 ]    obviously , conventional hb@xmath98pt fails at this special kinematic point because the nucleon propagator in a 1pr diagram , @xmath142 , is divergent .",
    "when this happens , one has to sum over all 1pr diagrams to get a `` nonperturbative '' contribution . in what follows",
    ", we are going to argue that all such divergent contributions just add up to the nucleon elastic contribution which we know how to calculate independently of hb@xmath98pt .",
    "let us consider a generic @xmath70-channel 1pr diagram shown in fig .",
    "5b in the usual fully - relativistic chiral perturbation theory .",

    ", there is no twist expansion , and hence one can not say anything about the size of the twist - four matrix element from anselmino et .",

    "for instance @xcite @xmath226 the @xmath227 correction has been expressed in terms of various nucleon matrix elements @xcite .",
    "no one has yet worked out the local operators associated with @xmath228 .",
    "the physical significance of the twist expansion is that at large @xmath5 , the compton amplitude can be understood in terms of the scattering of a few partons .",
    "what is the physical scale parameter which controls the twist expansion ? by studying the structure of higher - twist operators , one finds that the relevant dimensional parameter is the average parton transverse momentum in the nucleon @xcite . on dimensional grounds ,",
    "one can write @xmath229 the numerical size of @xmath230 is believed to be around 0.4 to 0.5 gev .",
    "therefore , the naive expectation is that the @xmath39-expansion is a good approximation down to @xmath231 gev@xmath14 .",
    "this picture is in fact consistent with the experimental data .",
    "as @xmath5 changes from @xmath42 to @xmath2 , the @xmath232-dependence of the @xmath233 scaling function changes significantly .",
    "however , its first moment , @xmath220 , is nearly independent of @xmath5 , as required by the twist expansion . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the twist - four matrix elements were extracted from the @xmath5 dependence of data on @xmath234 . in fig .",
    "7a , we have plotted the evolution of @xmath220 for the proton with the twist - two and twist - four contributions included ( @xmath235 is taken to be 0.04 gev@xmath14 ) .    at low @xmath5 , the elastic contribution dominates @xmath220 , which approaches @xmath236 as @xmath237 .",
    "as @xmath5 deviates from zero , @xmath220 falls rapidly due to the nucleon elastic form factor .",
    "the leading inelastic contribution appears as a linear term in @xmath5 and the slope can be obtained from the dhg sum rule .",
    "the sign of this slope enhances the rapid decrease of the elastic contribution .",
    "chiral perturbation theory allows us to compute the @xmath5 dependence of the inelastic contribution as a perturbation series in @xmath5 @xmath238 the total @xmath5 variation is @xmath239 in fig .",
    "7a , we have plotted the elastic contribution as the dashed curve and the elastic plus the leading term in @xmath240 as a solid curve .",
    "adding higher - order chiral corrections will bring changes to the solid curve .",
    "however , chiral power counting guarantees that the change in the @xmath5 range between 0 to approximately @xmath241 gev@xmath14 will be relatively small .",
    "therefore , we believe that the description of @xmath220 in terms of the hadron degrees of freedom will be trustable at least up to @xmath41 gev@xmath14 .",
    "[ fig7 ]    as fig .",
    "7a shows , the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath242 can already be understood over a large kinematic region in terms of chiral perturbation theory and the twist expansion .",

    "physically , however , the missing link is very interesting .",
    "this is the regime in which the transition between parton and hadron degrees of freedom happens and so it provides an important ground on which to test ideas about how the transition occurs .",
    "there is a possibility that chiral perturbation theory and the twist - expansion with the appropriate inclusion of higher - order terms ( e.g. pade approximation , resonance dominance , etc . )",
    "are simultaneously valid in an overlapping region .",
    "this scenario has been the main theoretical condition for the validity of qcd sum rule calculations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that there is an open window in which neither theory works . in this case , one must consider other methods , such as lattice qcd .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath32 can in fact be calculated in lattice qcd by rotating the minkowski time in eq .",
    "( 6 ) to euclidean .",
    "the global @xmath5-variation of @xmath220 reveals a simple and appealing physical picture .",
    "when the photon momentum is low , it scatters coherently over all the constituents of the nucleon and the response shows a diffractive type of peak which stands well above the pointlike value of 1/2 .",
    "when @xmath5 is large , the photon sees the individual quarks in the nucleon and the scattering is an incoherent sum of all charged constituents .",
    "thus , @xmath220 is necessarily much smaller than 1/2 .",
    "in fact , it will asymptotically vanish if the proton contains no pointlike particles but a smeared charge distribution .",
    "the transition between the whole proton and its constituent scattering happens at @xmath5 corresponding roughly to the size of the system .",
    "the only unattractive feature of fig .",
    "7a is that the elastic contribution at low @xmath5 overwhelms the inelastic contribution , making the transition region less dramatic .",
    "therefore , we plot in fig .",
    "7b the @xmath5-dependence of the subtracted integral @xmath243 , as suggested by anselmino et al .",
    "now , we see the our leading chiral prediction becomes a straight line which we draw up to 0.2 gev@xmath14 . on the high-@xmath5 side , we find that @xmath243 crosses from positive to negative at @xmath244 gev@xmath14 .",
    "the significance of this crossing point is that it is where the elastic contribution equals the prediction of the leading twist expansion . below this @xmath5",
    ", the curve dives down to meet the low - energy theorem @xmath245 and its chiral extension .",
    "therefore , while the detail may vary ( the crossing point is likely less than 0.5 gev@xmath14 according to e143 data @xcite ) , the seemingly intriguing @xmath5 variation of @xmath243 near the crossing point is nothing but a simple consequence of an innocent construct .",
    "the higher - order corrections in chiral perturbation theory and the twist - expansion may provide a more accurate account of how the drell - hearn - gerasimov sum rule finally meets that of bjorken .",
    "in this paper , we have studied generalized sum rules for the spin - dependent structure functions of the nucleon .",
    "we emphasize that to obtain sum rules , one has to find ways to calculate the virtual - photon forward compton amplitudes @xmath43 .",
    "away from the @xmath246 point where there is a well - known low - energy theorem , one can use chiral perturbation theory to calculate the @xmath13 and @xmath5 dependence .",
    "we find that for @xmath44 the leading chiral contribution vanishes because of the spin symmetry of the heavy - nucleon limit .",
    "the result from the next - order @xmath98pt calculation , for example , the coefficient of the @xmath247 term , will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our result for @xmath248 yields a new sum rule for the @xmath85 structure function .",
