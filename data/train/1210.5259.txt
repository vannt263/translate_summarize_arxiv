    "recent observations of the luminosity distances of the snia @xcite reveal that the expansion of the universe is accelerated and there is an unknown matter  energy contribution as about 70% of the critical density , which is smooth and has negative pressure . in order to explain this phenomenon ,",
    "it has been proposed many plausible solutions : the cosmological constant @xmath1 which is related to the vacuum energy of the quantum fields @xcite , quintessence fields ( with the state equation @xmath2=constant ) , kessence , taquionic fields , frustrated topological defects , extra  dimensions , massive ( or massless ) fermionic fields , galileons , effective parametrizations of the state equation , primordial magnetic fields , holographic models , etc .",
    "all these proposals have been used to model this contribution predicted by the friedmann equations in the framework of the general relativity .",
    "also , there are other possible options as modified gravity , where the accelerated expansion effect is geometric and not as a matter  energy form . + nowadays , the current paradigm is the @xmath1cdm model , which is so far the best fitting to the present observations , even though the conceptual problems that persist with the nature of @xmath1 .",
    "+ on the other hand , primordial abundances of the light nuclei that were formed during big bang nucleosynthesis ( * bbn * ) are well observed and quantified with astrophysical methods , specially the mass fraction of the @xmath3 . actually , there is an extended theory of bbn , introduced by alpher , bethe and gamov @xcite , and it has been developed many numerical codes that resolve the boltzmann equation for each isotope including the cosmological background ( based on kawano code ) .",
    "there is a good agreement between the predicted abundances and the observations , however , the main problem remains with @xmath4 . despite the efforts that have been made , including corrections on the cross sections of this element , the discrepancies are not negligible .",
    "+ with the aim to enhance the primordial abundances calculated from bbn and also , give a plausible explanation of the accelerated expansion of the universe , we have proposed a model of dark energy which has a non ",
    "null contribution at early times to increase the hubble radius during radiation domination era and influence the boltzmann equations that determine the evolution of the light abundances .",
    "all the conditions that allow us to describe the early dark energy are achieved with a k - essence scalar field , which is characterized by its state equation that overcomes the attractors defined by a dynamical system . + in the first section , we expose the main conditions imposed to the scalar field and we resolve the dynamical system that appears from the cosmological assumptions . at the second part",
    ", we propose the effective parametrization of the state equation , determinate the best estimations of the free parameters of the model using the luminosity distances of the snia from the union dataset and derive analytical expressions for the dynamical variables of the k - essence system . in the iv section ,",
    "we test our model with some standard proves and summarize the main differences between this model and @xmath1cdm .",
    "+ taking into account that there is a non - negligible energy density of the k - essence field during radiation era , we compute the bbn abundances , including the scalar field degrees of freedom in hubble parameter , following the derivation and discussion made by bernstein @xcite and using the available codes for nucleosynthesis .",
    "finally , we find the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 predicted by our model as a result of the bbn calculations .",
    "the k - essence scalar fields appeared at the late 90s with the k - inflation model proposed by armendariz - picon @xcite .",
    "however , the idea was extended to describe a dynamical dark energy contribution , taking into account that this field can track during radiation domination epoch and also , it could avoid the fine  tuning of the initial values of the field and its velocity .",
    "these features are well known for the system , so the challenge is resolve the evolution equations of the field in the flrw spatially flat universe and without cosmological constant .",
    "+ the lagrangian of the k - essence scalar field is given by :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the kinetic energy of the field and @xmath9 its velocity @xmath10 . rewriting in terms of @xmath9 ,",
    "the lagrangian has the following form :    @xmath11    the most general action that describes the k - essence field in a cosmological plasm is given by :    @xmath12    with @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the action of the background matter .",
    "the signature that is used is @xmath15 the equations of motion of the field come from the variation of the lagragian with respect to the field @xmath16 :    @xmath17    from , it is obtained the energy ",
    "momentum tensor :    @xmath18    since the scalar field can be described as a perfect fluid , the energy density and the pressure are defined by :    @xmath19    @xmath20    in addition , the adiabatic velocity of sound for the k - essence field is given by :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 denotes derivative with respect to the velocity of the field @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath23 gives relevant information of the stability of the perturbations associated with the k - essence field .",
    "+ in order to resolve the and find an explicit form of and , there have been suggested many alternatives : fixing a specific function of @xmath24 or @xmath25 @xcite , making redefinition of the field to face a modified lagrangian @xmath26 @xcite , considering pure kinetic k - essence model @xcite or imposing slow roll conditions on @xmath27 . +   + however , we want to resolve the complete dynamical system defined by the friedmann and the continuity equations for non - interactive fluids in the cosmological background : a matter ( or radiation component ) and the k - essence scalar field .",
    "@xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    reexpressing the equiations , , in terms of the velocity and the dimensionless variable @xmath31 ( matter energy density fraction ) : @xmath32,\\ ] ]    @xmath33    in addition , it must be fulfilled the following conditions :    @xmath34    @xmath35    it is assumed an asymptotic behaviour for the function @xmath27 @xcite :    @xmath36    to reach an attractor during radiation domination epoch , the dynamical system @xmath37 must fulfill the _",
    "ansatz _ :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 monotonically for @xmath40 ( or equivalently , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "the ansatz implies the following physical conditions on the system :    @xmath43    @xmath44    there is also a de - sitter attractor given by the condition @xmath45 , which guarantees the existence of a accelerated expansion at late times :    @xmath46    the last ansatz entails a condition on the state equation on the vicinity of the de - sitter attractor :    @xmath47",
    "in order to get a general solution for the dynamical system defined by , , , and , it has been proposed an effective parametrization of the state equation from @xmath49 given by :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is factor that modules the transitions between the attractors , @xmath52 is a redshift in matter domination epoch defined by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the redshift where the de - sitter domination -accelerated expansion- begins .",
    "+ the parametrization respects all the conditions previously mentioned , hence it is possible to resolve the functions related to the k - essence lagrangian .",

    "in addition , we have imposed other 2 conditions for the parameters : the deceleration parameter has to be zero at @xmath54 , therefore @xmath70 , but also @xmath71 has to overcome the maximum value at the primordial nucleosynthesis to contribute with some relativistic degrees of freedom and enhance the predicted primordial abundances .",
    "+ resolving simultaneously as , it is found the following values for the free parameters :    [ hohoho ]    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    according to the results shown in the table [ table c ] , we plot the abundances for the light nuclei including @xmath3 , for different contribution of the field , implemented as effective relativistic degrees of freedom in the code _ public bbn_.    [ figure6 ]",
    "in this work , we have made a general description of the dark energy component as a k - essence scalar field that evolves during radiation as a tracker ( @xmath72 ) and at late times achieves the de - sitter attractor @xmath73 , emulating cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "all the description was made in the hot cosmological plasm including matter - radiation components and assuming a spacially flat universe . with these assumptions for the field , we have proposed an effective parametrization for the state equation @xmath48 , that its free parameters estimations were obtained by minimizing the function @xmath74 with the distances modulus of the type ia supernovae .",
    "+ we have rewritten the velocity of the field and the non - canonical kinetic term of the k - essence lagrangian in terms of @xmath0 , obtaining the completed behaviour of the field during the thermal history and this let us say that k - essence system includes different classes of quintessence , when it is considered specific cases of the non - canonical term .",
    "another advantage with this formulation is that avoids the _ fine - tuning _ of the initials conditions of the field and its velocity . +",
    "as it was expected , during radiation and matter domination epochs the field has upper predictions for some observables @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath54 ( but respecting the observational bounds for them ) comparing with @xmath1cdm model .",
    "however , at late times @xmath77 tends asymptotically the standard model , after it has evolved from the radiation to the second attractor .",
    "all these results are in agreement with the conditions that have been imposed to resolve the dynamical system @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , when it is included the non - null contribution of the field during radiation domination era , the hubble factor is affected , but also the time capture and therefore , the primordial light nuclei abundances , because there were more neutrons out of the equilibrium to form @xmath78he by two body - reactions . actually , the whole reactions occurred faster , such that the production of the nuclei are more effective and drives in an upper mass fraction .",
    "+ the predicted value for the @xmath78he abundance prediction according to our model is inside the observational bounds , then , our model is an excellent candidate to a dynamic dark energy with a subdominant contribution during radiation and matter epoch .",
    "+ finally , it is remarkable that the results of this paper can be compared with other kind of models , because the field degrees of freedom can be treated as effective degrees of some other component ( for instance , a quintessence scalar field or even , sterile neutrinos @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we have include the field contribution in the numerical codes in these way , and it let us to compare degenerations of different kind of models . +    this work is supported and developed by the observatorio astronmico nacional under the auspices of universidad nacional de colombia .",
    "+ we also want to thank daniel molano , carlos cedeo and all the professors who give us an advise to enhance this paper in the international events that this work was presented .",
