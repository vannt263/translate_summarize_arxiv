    "the effect of noncommutativity is given in the momentum space vertices as the from of moyal bracket phase .",
    "to derive this factor , the authors in ref.@xcite consider a dipole in a magnetic field * b*. in the limit of strong magnetic field ( * b*@xmath3 ) , this dipole is frozen into the lowest landau level(lll ) .",
    "interaction of such dipoles include the moyal bracket phase factor of @xmath4 with @xmath5",
    ". however , in this process , the dipole in a strong magnetic field is turned out to be a galileian particle of mass @xmath6 because they neglect the kinetic terms .",
    "it is important to note that the noncommutativity comes just from the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the condition of `` strong '' makes the calculation easy and does not matter with the noncommutativity . in this sense",
    "it is valuable to study a field theory both in the presence of a magnetic field and in the coordinate space .",
    "actually one can derive the factor of @xmath7 from the operation @xmath8 of magnetic translation operator(@xmath9)@xcite .",
    "this means that when an electron travels around a parallelogram generated by @xmath8 it picks up a phase @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the magnetic flux in the parallelogram and @xmath12 is the flux quantum .",
    "the only difference between the momentum and coordinate spaces is the phase factor : in the momentum space it is proportional to @xmath13 while in the coordinate space it is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "this is so because the correct dimensions should be recovered .",
    "if we introduce the green s function in a magnetic field and in the coordinate space , this noncommutative situation is shown up clearly .",
    "for example , the one particle green s function for a free particle is@xcite @xmath15 whereas the one in the lll is given by@xcite @xmath16 , \\label{green - lll}\\ ] ] with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we note that @xmath19 is symmetric under @xmath20 .",
    "but @xmath21 no longer carries such a symmetry because of the presence of the phase factor .",
    "the phase factor originates from a subtle , combined property of translation and gauge transformation in the presence of magnetic field(_i.e .",
    "_ , the magnetic translation ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study the nonrelativistic anyonic model as a model of ( 2 + 1)d field theory on the noncommutative geometry .",
    "this model has already introduced to study the fractional statistics@xcite and anyonic physics@xcite .",
    "now we reconsider this model to explore its hidden noncommutative property .",
    "we can regard this model as a simple model which shows the noncommutativity .",
    "actually the noncommutativity appears as the matrix @xmath6 in the form of the anti - symmetric submatrix(@xmath22 ) .",
    "we start with the lagrangian for an ideal gas of fractional particles ( nonrelativistic anyons ) in a magnetic field ( @xmath0)@xcite @xmath23 + { 1 \\over { 2 \\alpha } } \\int d^2 x \\epsilon_{\\rho \\sigma \\tau } { a}_\\rho \\partial_\\sigma { a}_\\tau , \\label{lagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the @xmath25th particle coordinates , @xmath26(charge= @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30(statistical gauge potential ) and @xmath31(scalar potential ) .",
    "the first term is the kinetic term for nonrelativistic particles .",
    "the second one is their interaction with a magnetic field .",
    "the third term is their coupling with the statistical gauge potential .",
    "the last term is just the chen - simons term which associates with each particle fictitious flux @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 plays a role of the statistical parameter .",
    "the anyons are considered as identical particles ( fermions or hard - core bosons ) with the flux @xmath32 .",
    "on later , we need to introduce a harmonic potential term of ( @xmath34 ) to regularize the divergences@xcite .",
    "then our model ( [ lagrangian ] ) is very similar to ( 3 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "the difference is that in our case all particles carry the same charge @xmath35 , but bigatti and susskind considered a dipole with harmonic interaction between the charges to connect the string theory .",
    "further their way to lead the moyal phase factor is artificial .",
    "however we include this factor into the green s function without any vertex correction . using this green s function",
    ", we study the anyons on the noncommutative geometry .",
    "after some calculation , one finds the corresponding hamiltonian as @xmath36 where the mechanical momentum @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 with the canonical momentum @xmath39 . and the statistical gauge potential @xmath30 takes the form @xmath40 which satisfies the coulomb gauge condition @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "here we set @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane .",
    "let us see how the noncommutativity comes out from the presence of a magnetic field . in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the commutator of the momentum @xmath37 is given by @xmath45_{b=0 } = 0 .",

    "the schrdinger equation for the @xmath46 anyon is @xmath47 we now treat the @xmath33- and @xmath48-anyonic interactions in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) as the perturbations of the hamiltonian @xmath49 : @xmath50 here @xmath51 describes @xmath46 particles ( bosons or fermions ) moving in the uniform magnetic field .",
    "as it stands , the model with @xmath52 is very important .",
    "in particular , the study of ( 2 + 1)d nonrelativistic fermions in the presence of magnetic field is relevant to the fractional quantum hall effect(fqhe)@xcite .",
    "such a system has a further connection with ( 1 + 1)d @xmath53 string model@xcite .",
    "that is , a system of ( 2 + 1)d nonrelativistic fermions in the lll is dual to a boundary system of ( 1 + 1)d nonrelativistic fermions ( @xmath53 string model ) .",
    "this is very similar to the ads@xmath54/cft correspondence in the sense of the bulk / boundary dynamics@xcite .",
    "there exists a conceptual difficulty in doing the perturbation near @xmath55 . because of the singular nature of the @xmath56-interaction @xmath57 and the fact that a wave function does not vanish when any two bosonic particles approach each other ( @xmath58 ) , a naive perturbation would lead to an infinite energy shift@xcite . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we use the improved technique of the perturbation .",
    "the singular nature of the interaction forces the real wave function to vanish when @xmath59 .",
    "hence we redefine the @xmath46-body wave function as @xmath60 .",
    "one can easily show that all divergent terms in ( [ singular ] ) disappear if @xmath61 is equal to @xmath62 .",
    "it is worth noting that the prefactor @xmath63 can be interpreted as a factor which optimizes the dynamical short - range avoidance between anyons .",
    "the resulting equation is @xmath64 . here",
    "the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 the interaction terms in ( [ delta - h ] ) are two - body interactions , contrary to ( [ deltah ] ) where three - body interactions are present .",
    "this approach is based on the quantum - mechanical framework at first order in @xmath33 . for second and higher corrections , this is no longer useful .",
    "rather , it is appropriate to use a quantum field theory .",
    "in order to compute perturbatively the thermodynamic potential @xmath1 in the grand canonical ensemble , we introduce a second quantized formalism ( finite - temperature quantum field theory)@xcite .",
    "this formalism is also very useful for representing the magnetic translation symmetry .",
    "the thermodynamic potential is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 stand respectively for the second quantized hamiltonian and the number operator of anyons , and @xmath70 is the chemical potential [ @xmath71 . in terms of a second quantized field",

    "the last ( constant vertex ) couples the statistical parameter @xmath33 to the magnetic field and plays a crucial role in cancellation of divergences .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath62 term is not hermitian , and is complex as much as the anyonic vertex .",

    "a good regularization procedure should be introduced to resolve this problem by adding an extra potential term of confining nature . for simplicity",
    "we introduce a harmonic regulator to give an unambiguous meaning to all diagrams(fig.[first - order ] - fig.[second - cluster ] )",
