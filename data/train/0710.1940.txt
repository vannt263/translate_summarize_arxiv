    "an important basic problem in the studies of the glassy dynamics is the isothermal aging , i.e. , relaxation at fixed temperature from initial states far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "aging of elastic manifolds in random media has been studied theoretically by dynamical mean - field theories @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite .",

    "the purpose of the present paper is to analyze aging of an elastic manifold in random media in terms of @xmath1 and investigate crossovers between the two characteristic regimes : so called the larkin regime and glassy regime .",
    "a standard theoretical model to study the above mentioned cdw-_like _ systems is the elastic manifold model in random potential , e.g. the fukuyama - lee - rice model @xcite , given by the following hamiltonian @xmath3 .",

    "hereafter @xmath10 means a thermal average and @xmath11 means an average over the quenched randomness ( samples ) .    let us recall here some basic _ static _ properties of the system which is understood better than the dynamical properties of our interests .",
    "it is believed that physical properties of this kind of systems , such as the roughness characterized by @xmath12 , are different on three distinct length scales @xcite .",
    "first , in very short length regime , perturbative analysis of the effects of disorder predict algebraic growth of the roughness with distance @xmath13 : @xmath14 with some roughness exponent @xmath15 . below four dimensions",
    "it is known that @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "this is because the potential has only single characteristic scale , that is a period @xmath21 , and does not have another smaller scale which yields the upper bound of the larkin regime such as short ranged correlation length of potential along @xmath18-direction .    in this paper",

    "it means that the quenched random potential does not bring pinning effects at the level of its linear approximation .",
    "it is easy to see that this is the case at any higher levels of perturbative treatments of the random potential .",

    "it can be seen that at larger @xmath79 the amplitude saturates to @xmath2-independent but @xmath79-dependent value while at smaller @xmath79 the amplitude remains @xmath2-dependent but @xmath79-independent .",

    "one obtains the corresponding scaling form for @xmath88 as @xmath89 ( note that the above scaling holds only if the system size @xmath90 is sufficiently larger than @xmath1 for a given time @xmath2 . )",
    "indeed one can find easily that the larkin model discussed in section [ sec : larkin ] satisfies these scalings exactly at @xmath91 .",
    "however , the real behavior will be more complicated even in the larkin regime because roughness originates not only from the quenched random field but also from the thermal noise at finite temperatures .",

    "( [ eq : tc ] ) corresponding to the larkin length @xmath103 .",

    "we suppose that the scaling functions @xmath112 and @xmath113 take the following asymptotic forms in the larkin regime , @xmath114 the scaling function @xmath115 with @xmath116 describes the equilibrium structure factor : @xmath117 in the larkin regime @xmath118 and @xmath119 in the glassy regime @xmath120 .",
    "the exponent @xmath121 is an unknown roughness exponent in the glassy regime which will be smaller than @xmath122 .",
    "particularly @xmath121 will be zero if the system has quasi long range order .",
    "on the other hand , the scaling function @xmath123 with @xmath124 describes the growth law of @xmath1 in the larkin regime @xmath125 and the glassy regime @xmath126 .",
    "more precisely , the dynamical length @xmath1 can be estimated by solving @xmath127 the function @xmath128 is an unknown increasing function of the scaled time @xmath129 in the glassy regime which will be slower than any algebraic functions due to the anticipated activated dynamics @xcite .    for @xmath130 and @xmath131 ,",
    "the above scaling reproduces eq .",
    "( [ eq : sq_el ] ) in the larkin regime .",
    "however it turns out that certain vertex corrections are needed in the coefficients as @xmath132 and @xmath133 in analyzing the raw data .",
    "these coefficients appear when performing perturbation expansion of the random potential beyond the linear approximation in section [ sec : larkin ] . in the following analysis we treated the first order correction terms only and regarded them as fitting parameters .",
    "now let us examine the validity of the scaling law presented above using our numerical data .",
    "scaling functions @xmath123 and @xmath115 are determined by least square fitting .",
    "first we perform fitting by fixing the temperature @xmath31 .",

    "we note that the larkin length can weakly depends on temperature , @xmath139 ^{-1/(4-d)}. \\label{eq : lct}\\ ] ] the constant @xmath140 will be larger for higher temperatures because thermal fluctuations will mask the quenched random potential over short length scales . in practice we treated @xmath140 as a fitting parameter .",
    "then as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x - x ] , scaling function @xmath113 for different temperatures can be laid on a universal curve independent of temperatures .",
    "the resultant correction factor @xmath140 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : x - x ] .",
    "the scaling function @xmath123 exhibits the crossover from the power - law domain growth to the glassy dynamics .",
    "looking fig .",
    "[ fig : x - x ] carefully , the scaling function @xmath112 is not universal , which is more apparent in lower temperature .",
    "particularly the relaxation stops on the way at zero temperature .",
    "this indicates that the relaxation in the long time regime is thermally activated process .",
    "the system can not escape from a metastable state without thermal assistance .",
    "the scaling function @xmath141 represents the structure factor in the equilibrium state ( @xmath142 ) . from the present",
    "scaling we obtain its shape even for the small wave numbers @xmath143 where @xmath80 is still far from equilibrium . while the growth law @xmath144 turned out to depend on the temperature @xmath31 , we find that @xmath145 is essentially independent of the temperature @xmath31 .",
    "this means that spatial correlation function in equilibrium has universal form independent of both @xmath31 and @xmath26 .",

    "we especially focused on the crossover between the larkin regime and the glassy regime , i.e. , power - law domain growth and thermally activated relaxation .",
