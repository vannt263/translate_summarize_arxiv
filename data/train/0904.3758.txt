    "a long - standing problem of non - abelian gauge theories ( nagts ) is the lack of positivity of the imaginary part of the gauge - boson propagator , violating the kllen - lehmann ( k - l ) representation .",
    "this was first pointed out in an early paper on the gauge - invariant pinch - technique ( pt ) propagator @xcite .",
    "later , many authors found the same behavior in lattice simulations of the gauge - dependent and unphysical propagator of the landau gauge @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "although it is questionable to assign a physical meaning to this lack of positivity in a gauge - dependent quantity such as the landau - gauge propagator , many authors see it as a sign of confinement , since the propagator of an unconfined field presumably has a normal k - l representation .",
    "aubin and ogilvie @xcite trace it to technical deficiencies in lattice gauge - fixing procedures .",
    "in this paper we argue that it is plausible ( but unproven ) that this lack of positivity is an elementary consequence of asymptotic freedom , and is simply resolved by a factorization of the pt propagator into two terms each of which is both gauge- and renormalization group ( rg)-invariant , and each satisfies the k - l representation .",
    "we construct some simple analytic models of the pt propagator and vertex that illustrate the necessary positivity and absence of unphysical singularities , provided that there is a sufficiently - large dynamical gluon mass .",
    "we also discuss models of the analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) type , which can satisfy positivity with zero gluon mass but still have unphysical behavior .",
    "section [ notation ] briefly covers notation as well as some background on the pt . in section [ signprob ]",
    "we argue that the lack of positivity is a simple consequence of asymptotic freedom and the fact @xcite that the product of the coupling @xmath0 and the ( scalar part of the ) gauge - invariant pt propagator @xmath1 is not only gauge - invariant but also rg - invariant , independent of the choice of a renormalization point .",
    "this makes this product a truly physical quantity .",
    "the same is true for the photon propagator in qed , as has been known for decades , and for the same reason : the ward identities of qed or of the pt require that the gluon vertex function renormalization constant and a wave - function renormalization constant be the same .",
    "not every non - perturbative approximation for the propagator can be expected to satisfy these positivity constraints , in an asymptotically - free gauge theory . in the rest of the paper",
    "we construct non - perturbative models that do satisfy them , provided that there is a large enough dynamical gluon mass .",
    "section [ massparam ] is an illustration , within the context of an analytically - soluble model similar to an earlier @xcite one - dressed - loop schwinger - dyson equation ( sde ) for the pt propagator , of how the positivity argument above can only be realized with a sufficiently large gluon mass . in the model ,",
    "provided that the gluon mass @xmath6 is large enough ( on the qcd scale @xmath7 ) each factor in the product @xmath8 behaves precisely as would be expected , with no bizarre behavior coming from non - positivity .",
    "but if @xmath9 is less than a critical value @xmath10 spurious singularities arise , such as ghost or spacelike poles in the propagator .",
    "we estimate @xmath11 in our study of the one - dressed - loop pt propagator ; given the approximations made there , we believe the range should be from 1 to 1.5 or so .",
    "this effectively provides , as we will see , an upper limit to the running charge at zero momentum : @xmath12 .",
    "this is fairly consistent with other determinations from phenomenology @xcite , studies @xcite of the pt sde , and a study of the functional schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "section [ aptsec ] briefly reviews the evolution of apt from an originally massless form @xcite with correct positivity properties , yet showing unphysical behavior , to a massive form rather similar to that of @xcite and the present paper . in",
    "the original apt positivity was satisfied , although the pt upper limit on @xmath13 is exceeded , with @xmath14 .",
    "this in itself is not necessarily serious , but what is serious is that the apt running charge , even though finite at zero momentum , has infinite slope . a later work @xcite corrects this deficiency by invoking an _ ad hoc",
    "_ gluon mass , in somewhat the same spirit as the pt gluon mass , with results quite similar to our first model .",
    "other authors @xcite have also invoked masses as cutoffs for apt .",
    "section [ toyvert ] remarks on the important fact that the vertex sde can be reformulated entirely in terms of the propagator factor @xmath5 with a positive spectral function and a special half - proper vertex that is both gauge- and rg - invariant ; the original pt propagator @xmath4 , with its positivity violations , never appears .",
    "this reformulation avoids possible violations of positivity that could allow unphysical vertex behavior .",
    "we illustrate with an analytic approximation inspired by a one - dressed - loop toy model @xcite of the schwinger - dyson equation for the three - gluon vertex and show that it has a spurious spacelike singularity if the gluon mass is too small .",
    "section [ toynomass ] is a discussion of certain typical all - order extensions and resummations of the _ massless _ toy model that still lead to unphysical singularities ; these can only be resolved with a dynamical gluon mass .",
    "write the obvious factorization of the product @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gauge- , scheme- , and renormalization - point - independent running charge of the pt .",
    "the other factor @xmath3 has the same properties , since the product does . we argue that _ both _ factors obey a standard k - l representation with a positive imaginary part ( our metric is such that @xmath18 for timelike vectors ) : @xmath19 and @xmath20 are positive",
    ". the lower limit involves the dynamical gluon mass @xmath6 , which we discuss later .",
    "we plausibly know the behavior at infinite momentum of both factors in the product .",
    "asymptotic freedom tells us that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the lowest - order coefficient in the beta - function and @xmath7 is the qcd scale . as for @xmath3",
    "there is no reason from perturbation theory or non - perturbative pt constructions to believe that it departs from the simple free - field behavior @xmath23 for large momentum .",
    "for example , it is well - known that the pt is equivalent order by order to the background field feynman gauge @xcite , and old perturbative calculations in this gauge through two loops @xcite show that all large - momentum logarithms are accounted for in the running charge .",
    "the result is that at large momentum the pt propagator vanishes according to @xmath24 . but a propagator vanishing more rapidly than @xmath23 implies that the spectral function in the would - be k - l representation is necessarily negative somewhere .",
    "there is , we claim , only an indirect connection  at least for the gauge - invariant pt propagator  between non - positivity and confinement ( a connection only to the extent that asymptotic freedom implies confinement ) .",
    "in fact , the gluon is not confined , but screened , in the usual sense that the string in the adjoint - representation wilson loop always breaks at sufficiently large distance even with no adjoint matter fields .",
    "we will not attempt any analysis of non - positivity in the landau - gauge , but it is likely that even if some non - positivity comes from the aubin - ogilvie @xcite effect , there will still be some residual non - positivity coming from asymptotic freedom .",
    "what happens at infrared momenta ?",
    "it has long been argued @xcite that the qcd gluon should pick up a dynamical mass that completely preserves local gauge symmetry .",
    "this is consistent with phenomenology ( for example , @xcite ) , and a number of studies of the pt schwinger - dyson equations @xcite have found @xcite a pt pole mass @xmath6 of order 0.6 gev . these studies also indicate that the mass runs with momentum and should be denoted @xmath25 , consistent with the operator - product expansion result that @xmath26 vanishes ( modulo logarithms ) like @xmath27 at large momentum @xcite .",
    "there is a large body of lattice - simulation evidence in the landau gauge @xcite for a gluon mass of several hundred mev .",
    "( the pole mass of the gluon propagator in any gauge is gauge - invariant and physical , although because it is a timelike pole it is not easy to determine from lattices simulations . )",
    "we think it plausible , then , that @xmath3 has some such form as : @xmath28 where @xmath25 is the running mass . for simplicity and brevity ,",
    "we use in this paper a fixed gluon mass ; running does not interfere with the main positivity arguments .",
    "then @xmath5 is a simple free massive propagator .",
    "begin with some notation .",
    "the pinch - technique propagator has the form : @xmath29 the corresponding inverse pinch - technique propagator is : @xmath30 + \\frac{1}{\\xi}q_{\\alpha}q_{\\beta}.\\ ] ] the scalar function @xmath4 is completely independent of the gauge chosen .",
    "the pt is a systematic way of extracting gauge - invariant proper self - energies , vertices , and the like from gauge - invariant quantities such as the s - matrix .",
    "the pt propagator , for example , is not constructed just from the usual feynman graphs ; it also receives contributions from other graphs through a so - called  pinch \" , in which longitudinal momenta in numerators , coming from vertices and propagators , trigger ward identities leading to the replacement of certain propagators by unity .",
    "this changes the topology of the graphs where this occurs , and some of these pinch contributions are readily recognized as contributions of propagator type . although not recognized at the beginning , it is now known @xcite that the pt is the same graphical expansion as that of the background field - feynman gauge .",
    "because the whole point of the pt is to maintain gauge invariance , it is essential that , when this graphical expansion is resummed to a dressed - loop or skeleton expansion , all green s functions appearing in the skeleton expansion obey the correct ward identities . in the case of the pt",
    "these are the naive ward identities of qed , with no ghosts .",
    "it would appear that progress can only be made by solving all possible sdes at once , since that will guarantee satisfaction of the ward identities .",
    "however , it is possible to find _ approximate _ three- and higher - point proper vertices that satisfy the ward identities exactly and that are expressed solely in terms of the pt propagator itself .",
    "this approximation , known as the gauge technique , is valid for infrared - dominated phenomena .",
    "although we will not give any details here , we have in mind the gauge technique of ref .",
    "@xcite , which gives the following expression ( group indices suppressed ) for the gauge technique proper vertex : @xmath31\\frac{k_{3\\gamma}}{k_3 ^ 2 } + cyc.\\;perm.\\ ] ] where the first term on the right is the bare vertex @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the pt proper self - energy introduced above .",
    "this vertex satisfies : @xmath34 no matter what the choice of @xmath35 is . in consequence ,",
    "an approximate but fully gauge - invariant one - dressed - loop sde for the pt propagator can be written solely in terms of that propagator .",
    "it is in this sense that we speak of studying the pt propagator on its own terms , without further specification of the vertex beyond that of the gauge technique . in this paper",
    "we use the self - contained pt propagator equation of ref .",
    "later we will study a toy model of a  half - proper \" three - gluon pt vertex sde in which some factors coming from the propagators are incorporated in the definition of the vertex , and we arrive at essentially self - contained vertex sdes .",
    "define a k - l function as a real - analytic function with at most one pole and a cut along the real positive axis , satisfying an unsubtracted dispersion relation with a positive spectral function .",
    "we conjecture that the pt propagator is the product of two k - l functions .",
    "the product of two k - l functions may or may not be a k - l function , but in the present case we know it can not be , because the product vanishes faster than @xmath23 near infinity .",
    "the product of two k - l functions having this property therefore requires a spectral function that changes sign .",
    "multiply together two k - l functions , call them @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for each function",
    "we have : @xmath38 with @xmath39 nowhere negative .",
    "the product @xmath40 obeys the dispersion relation : @xmath41 with @xmath42 which may be negative in places .",
    "we note parenthetically that it is possible , in certain field theories involving scalar particles , for the propagator ( taken to be k - l ) to have a single zero between the particle mass and the lowest two - particle threshhold and for the proper vertex to have a pole at the same place . in our case",
    "this would correspond to a zero in @xmath3 for @xmath43 .",
    "but for propagator models what we use as a criterion for a critical mass , based on asymptotic freedom , is not to exclude a zero of the propagator but to exclude an unwanted pole .",
    "it is true that the vertex models we study define a ",
    "critical \" mass by excluding vertex singularities , but these are not related in any obvious way to zeroes of @xmath5 . in any case we explicitly exclude the possibility of a zero in @xmath5 by assumption , and our techniques show no signs of such a zero developing .",
    "see @xcite for further details and references .",
    "the conventional approach to the propagator , whether from the pt or elsewhere , is to calculate in some approximation the proper self - energy , that is , the inverse propagator .",
    "the technique of going from the propagator to the inverse propagator ( or _ vice versa _ ) reminds us of analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) , which we discuss in the following section .",
    "apt was used in the nagt context to render @xmath13 finite , even in the zero - mass limit . however , an unphysical singularity remains , and in fact mass - improved apt also has a critical mass @xmath44 that is rather close to the values we give in this section .",
    "we assume that there is at most one pole in the pt propagator , at @xmath45 , representing dynamical gluon mass formation , and no zeroes , and we replace the factor @xmath5 of eq .",
    "( [ fullpropform ] ) by the simple massive propagator @xmath46 , where the mass does not run .",
    "our pretensions to accuracy in the infrared do not justify saving the running , so @xmath47 can be thought of as either the running mass at zero momentum or the pole mass , within the accuracy to which we aspire .",
    "long ago , a form of the pinch technique was used to estimate the dynamical gluon mass @xcite , and interpreted in the factorized form outlined above . in the formulas of @xcite",
    "we ignore the running of the mass , and the non - linear integral equation then becomes : @xmath48^{-1}=q^2bz-\\frac{ib}{\\pi^2}\\int d^4k\\hat{h}(k ) \\hat{h}(k+q)\\{q^2+\\frac{m^2}{11 } \\}+c+\\dots\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath49 summarizes the seagull graph and other momentum - independent terms , and we also omit two - loop contributions . rather than trying to solve this equation",

    "( [ toyd4 ] ) is singular at zero momentum unless @xmath149 , which we forbid .",
    "nevertheless the differential equation can be solved , showing features expected from perturbation theory , and we can impose boundary conditions at @xmath150 and study the ultraviolet behavior .    in the ultraviolet regimes",
    "one finds results familiar from the rg : the functional form of the asymptotic vertex is precisely that of the full nagt except for the value of some numerical coefficients , and all signs agree with what is needed for asymptotic freedom . for large @xmath151",
    "the second derivative term is non - leading ; if dropped , the general solution to the first - order differential equation is : @xmath152 this coupling is singular , as massless perturbation theory must be .",
    "when the second derivative term is kept , a solution is generated which has all the same terms as the all - order perturbative running charge in true qcd , but with somewhat different coefficients .",
    "all these coefficients have the correct sign for an asymptotically - free theory .",
    "there is also an interesting beta - function , governed by its own differential equation .",

    "( [ nomassbeta ] ) is singular at a finite upper critical coupling @xmath157 .",
    "we give here a new toy model inspired by but differing slightly from the original massive toy model of eq .",

    "it has the same ultraviolet ( massless ) properties as the old model and as qcd does itself . as before we take @xmath5 as a free massive propagator .",
    "there is no longer a simple differential form of the original toy model equation eq .",
    "( [ toyd4 ] ) when masses are included , but the following approximation to the euclidean angular integration does give an ordinary differential equation : @xmath158}\\approx \\frac{\\theta ( q^2-k^2)}{q^2+m^2 } + \\frac{\\theta ( k^2-q^2)}{k^2+m^2}\\ ] ] the approximation is exact for large @xmath159 as well as when @xmath160 ( or @xmath161 ) and is otherwise too large by a factor which is at most about 1.3 times the true angular integral at @xmath162 . from this follows the one - dimensional integral equation : @xmath163 every solution of this integral equation @xmath129 satisfies the differential equation : @xmath164''=-\\frac{bq^2\\hat{g}^3(q^2)}{2(q^2+m^2)^2}\\ ] ] where a prime indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath165 .",

    "it is not difficult to check from the integral equation ( [ approxint ] ) that at large momenta only the @xmath170 term is leading , yielding the exact leading behavior @xmath171 at large @xmath165 . the @xmath172 term in eq .",

    "we can understand the basic behavior of the equation by looking at the degree to which factorial growth at large coupling is tamed by the principal - part prescription .",
    "the power - series expansion of @xmath208 is @xmath209 and its asymptotic behavior at infinity is @xmath210 .",
    "this is very different from the finite-@xmath191 models of eq .",
    "( [ kdiffeq ] ) . in these , the increasingly - strong growth with @xmath98 of the right - hand side as @xmath191 gets larger means that any singularity occur at smaller values of @xmath98 .",
    "but for equations with the @xmath208 source there is no such movement toward smaller couplings because @xmath208 is not growing rapidly at large @xmath98 . in the beta - function equation ( [ nomassbeta2 ] ) one easily finds the large-@xmath98 asymptotic behavior @xmath211 with @xmath212 .",
    "so instead of generating a finite-@xmath138 singularity , the beta - function turns from @xmath213 behavior near the origin to linear at large enough @xmath138 ; numerical simulations confirm this .",
    "for the massless vertex equation ( [ massless1 ] ) there is still a singularity in the infrared , so that @xmath129 gets large and the large @xmath98 behavior of @xmath208 matters . in this regime",
    "the massless equation ( [ massless1 ] ) becomes linear , and one finds unphysical behavior of the type @xmath214 .",
    "so massless vertex dynamics is not regularized by the specific behavior of @xmath208 .",
    "mass is important not only for the right - hand sides of the vertex and beta - function equations , as summarized by the function @xmath215 , but it is important in the left - hand side of such equations , as we show below .",
    "in fact , the mass damping is so strong that it is probably unnecessary to worry about vertex graphs of very high order ; @xmath129 does not get large enough to probe the asymptotic limit of @xmath216 , as it does for the massless case .",
    "we argue that although the gauge - invariant pt propagator does not obey the k - l representation , it is the product of two factors that do have the required positive spectral functions . we show that this holds true for an analytic approximation to the one - dressed - loop pt propagator equation , and that this approximation implies a critical mass @xmath44 such that the true dynamical mass @xmath6 must exceed @xmath44 or spurious singularities arise .",
    "we construct an analytically - soluble toy model of one - dressed - loop pt three - gluon vertex model with a cubic non - linearity and show how the positivity of the factor @xmath5 in the pt propagator plays an essential role in the vertex dynamics , in particular the occurrence of a mass value which must be exceeded by @xmath6 to avoid unwanted singularities .",
    "we argue that higher - order , even regulated all - order , extensions of the _ massless _ toy model equations do not remove these singularities .",
