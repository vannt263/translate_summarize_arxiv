    "solid phase epitaxy ( spe ) is an important processing step in device fabrication yet the mechanism by which atoms make the amorphous to crystalline phase transition is still poorly understood .",
    "it is known that the velocity of the crystalline - amorphous ( @xmath3-@xmath0 ) interface ( spe rate ) has a strong dependence on a number of parameters including pressure,@xcite substrate orientation,@xcite and dopant concentration@xcite .",
    "the spe rate in intrinsic silicon is also well described by an arrhenius type equation with an activation energy of 2.7  ev.@xcite    pioneering work on dopant - enhanced spe was performed by csepregi and co - workers who used ion channeling measurements to determine surface @xmath0-si layer thicknesses as a function of annealing time and temperature.@xcite csepregi found that the presence of impurity atoms enhanced the spe rate up to 6 times that of the intrinsic rate for p and as and up to 20 times for b with impurity concentrations of 0.4 at.% .",
    "further , it has been found that overlapping @xmath4- and @xmath5-type dopants of a similar concentration give an spe rate close to that of an intrinsic sample , a compensation doping effect.@xcite likewise , the overlapping of two dopants of the same type gives an additive effect on the spe regrowth rate .",
    "these electronic effects suggest that the spe rate is sensitive to shifts in the fermi level and that both neutral and charged defects may be responsible for the spe process .",
    "indeed , a number of models link the structural and electrical properties at the @xmath3-@xmath0 interface in an attempt to describe the spe phenomenon .",
    "@xcite however , there is a significant problem with the experimental data for spe growth of surface amorphous layers to which the spe models have been fitted . in surface",
    "amorphous layers , the spe rate is invariably affected by the presence of h which infiltrates the layer from the native oxide and retards the spe growth rate.@xcite roth _",
    "et al . _ have shown that the growth rate is affected for interface depths of up to @xmath6 .",
    "recent measurements also suggest that the infiltration of h can affect the dopant - enhanced spe regrowth rate.@xcite these findings call into question the reliability of the parameters found in previous work where spe models have been fitted to the h - affected data .",
    "this paper presents data for dopant - enhanced spe kinetics in buried @xmath0-si layers .",
    "buried @xmath0-si layers provide an environment where h concentrations at the @xmath3-@xmath0 interface are considerably lower than the levels which have a measurable affect on spe rates.@xcite h - free dopant - enhanced spe data are presented for as , p , b and al measured over a concentration range of @xmath7 .",
    "as - enhanced spe data are care of mccallum .",
    "@xcite the experimental data are fitted to the generalized fermi level shifting ( gfls ) model which is one of the more highly developed models describing the dopant - enhancement effect in spe which at this stage has not met with any significiant challenge to its validity .",
    "@xcite by fitting the model to spe data for both @xmath8 and @xmath9type impurities over a broad concentration range we are able to show that the model provides plausible values for fitting parameters which may eventually lead to the identification of the defect(s ) responsible for the spe process . in fitting the data , we have refined the gfls model by incorporating degenerate semiconductor statistics and by endeavoring to use the most valid values and dependencies for parameters which affect semiconductor statistics .",
    "these parameters include the electron and hole effective masses and the temperature and concentration dependencies of the band gap .",
    "an extension of the model to include the effect of band bending at the @xmath3-@xmath0 interface is discussed .",
    "further , the scope for developing links between our data and molecular dynamics simulations of the interface motion during spe as a possible means of identifying the mechanism giving rise to dopant - enhancement are also discussed .",
    "in section [ gfls ] of this paper we provide a brief overview of the theoretical background to the gfls model . in section [ experiment ]",
    "we present the experimental parameters associated with our measurements of intrinsic and dopant - enhanced spe rates .",
    "section [ results ] presents the spe rate data and fits to this data using the gfls model and section [ conclusions ] presents our conclusions .",
    "details of the parameters and functional dependences used to calculate the semiconductor statistics and hence the fermi levels in the temperature range of our spe measurements are given in the appendix .",
    "atomistic spe models have offered some insight into the rate - limiting step of the spe process and can be used to predict the orientation dependence of the crystallisation rate through the proportionality of the growth rate with the concentration of [ 110 ] ledges .",
    "the concentration of these ledges increases with deviations away from the @xmath10 crystallographic direction.@xcite the shortcoming of atomistic approaches lies in their inability to predict the growth rate dependence on dopant concentration which is more likely to be explained by models based on electronic processes .    while conducting experiments on the compensation effect in the epitaxial regrowth rate of @xmath0-si , suni _ et al .",
    "_ suggested that the bond - breaking process was mediated by vacancies that formed and migrated at the @xmath3-@xmath0 interface.@xcite this assumption was based on a finding by csepregi that the activation energies of spe regrowth and the formation of vacancies were similar.@xcite using the vacancy model by van vechten and thurmond,@xcite suni _",
    "related the concentration of charged vacancies to the position of the fermi level in the band - gap and its dependence on doping concentration .",
    "the doping concentration is proportional to the number of charged vacancies while the number of neutral vacancies is not affected . with a greater total concentration of vacancies at the interface",
    "the spe growth rate was assumed to be enhanced via some vacancy - related bond - breaking process .",
    "the assumption that vacancies are the spe defect has since been ruled out due to the observation of a negative activation volume for the spe process in studies where the pressure dependence has been measured.@xcite however , the model was significant in that it provided a possible mechanism by which the number of growth sites at the interface could depend on doping and it related the rate - enhancement to the presence of defect energy levels within the band gap .",
    "the charged kink - site model proposed by williams and elliman,@xcite is an extension of atomistic models introduced by spaepen and turnbull.@xcite they considered a bond - breaking process involving the propagation of kink - like growth sites along [ 110 ] ledges .",
    "they made reference to defects associated with distorted silicon - silicon bonds being responsible for the bond - breaking process at the kink sites but did not specify the exact nature of the defects .",
    "williams and elliman proposed that the fermi level on the amorphous side of the @xmath3-@xmath0 interface would be pinned near mid - gap and that therefore the number of charged kink - related defects at the interface available to promote spe would be governed by the doping dependence of the fermi - level in the crystalline material .",
    "williams and elliman arrived at an expression for the rate - enhancement which is equivalent to : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the spe rate in doped material , @xmath13 is the rate in intrinsic material , @xmath14 is the dopant concentration and @xmath15 is some function of temperature and is independent of @xmath14 . in arriving at this expression , they used parameters and functional dependencies appropriate to an extrinsic non - degenerate semiconductor and assumed that the dopants were fully ionized .",
    "at the time the model was proposed , the paucity of reliable spe velocity data as a function of dopant concentration meant that the dopant dependence predicted by the model could not be accurately tested .",
    "since reliable spe data which is not affected by h has become available , it is clear that some of the simplifying assumptions which they made are not valid .",
    "however , their model still has significant merit .",
    "walser _ et al .",
    "_ also introduced a model based on the ideas of spaepen and turnbull.@xcite the model assumes that the capture of dangling bonds ( db ) at the @xmath3-@xmath0 interface is the rate - limiting step to the spe process and that the concentration of these defects is determined by the band structure on the amorphous side of the interface .",
    "the fermi level is assumed to be pinned to mid gap on the amorphous side of the interface and does not affect the spe rate . instead , the model suggests that the concentration of dbs is changed by the doping concentration through ionization enhanced atomic mobility as per bourgoin and germain.@xcite the equations derived from this model provide reasonable fits to the data .",
    "however , the assumptions on which they are based severely limit the model s applicability and interpretation as correctly pointed out by lu _",
    "et al._@xcite namely , the law of mass action is violated when assuming that the fractional ionization of dopant atoms in @xmath0-si is independent of concentration .",
    "it should also be noted that the spe rate data to which their model was fitted was hydrogen affected .    in their reanalysis of the williams and elliman charged kink site model , lu _",
    "_ noted that for kink motion to occur , bond rearrangement must take place and that this would most likely occur via the breaking of bonds which span the @xmath3-@xmath0 interface followed by local rearrangement and then recombination of the dangling bonds .",
    "hence , they considered the kink site model to be a special case of the dangling bond model of spaepen and turnbull@xcite in which the dangling bonds are annihilated locally and relatively quickly without taking a large number of jumps prior to annihilation .",
    "et al . _ also reworked the electronic aspects of the charge kink site model , relaxing some of the assumptions which had been made .",
    "they called this reworked model the generalized fermi level shifting ( gfls ) model .",
    "it is this model which we have further developed by incorporating degenerate semiconductor statistics and by endeavouring to use the most valid parameters .    in the gfls model , spe",
    "is thought to occur via bond breaking and rearrangement at the @xmath3-@xmath0 interface mediated by a neutral defect , @xmath16 , and its positively or negatively charged counterparts , @xmath17 .",
    "the defects may be dangling bonds or they may be some other defect .",
    "the model does not attempt to specify this .",
    "it is assumed that the defects are in thermal and electronic equilibrium and that the concentrations of @xmath17 are determined by the band structure and density of states ( dos ) of the bulk crystal .",
    "the spe regrowth rate is then expected to be proportional to the concentration of these defects . for an @xmath4-type semiconductor and it s intrinsic counterpart the velocities are given by    [ velocity ] @xmath18+[d^{-}]|_{\\rm doped})\\ ] ] and @xmath19+[d^{-}]|_{\\rm intrinsic})\\ ] ]    respectively , where @xmath20 is a constant and @xmath21 $ ] is the concentration of neutral defects and is independent of doping .",
    "these equations assume that for @xmath4-type material , spe is dominated by @xmath16 and @xmath22 and that each of these defects are equally capable of promoting interface motion .",
    "the charged fraction of defects is determined by fermi - dirac statistics and , for an @xmath4-type semiconductor , is expressed as the ratio of charged to neutral defect concentrations in the crystal ,    @xmath23|_{\\rm doped}}{[d^{0}]\\ ; } = g \\exp\\bigl(\\frac{e_{f}-e^{-}}{kt}\\bigr)\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the fermi level and @xmath25 represents the energy level within the band gap of the defect responsible for the spe process .",
    "the degeneracy factor , @xmath26 , associated with @xmath25 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the internal degeneracies of the @xmath22 and @xmath16 defect states , respectively.@xcite if a db defect is responsible for the spe process then it is expected that @xmath30 if only the spin degeneracy needs to be considered .",
    "for the positive charge state of the db , @xmath31 as the degeneracy of the valence band also contributes a factor of two .",

    "_ assumed that the mobilities of charged and uncharged dbs are identical.@xcite if the charged and neutral defect concentrations are weighted separately with a factor @xmath20 and @xmath33 in eq .",
    "[ velocity ] then this will have the affect of weighting the degeneracy factor in eq .  [ fit ] by a value of @xmath34 .",
    "the energy level of the defect predicted by the model will be unaffected by this assumption .",

    ", @xmath25 is assumed to track the conduction band edge , @xmath36 .",
    "the variation of @xmath24 with temperature has been exaggerated to show that it approaches the conduction band edge as the temperature decreases .",
    "as this occurs , the population of charged spe defects , @xmath37 $ ] will increase as the @xmath24 approaches its energy level .",
    "the dopant enhanced spe rate relative to the intrinsic rate ( eq . [ fit ] ) will then be greatest for anneals performed at lower temperatures .",
    "a shortcoming of the model is that the temperature dependence of the spe defect energy level is not known and can not be included in these calculations as pointed out by lu _",

    "this calculation and the required semiconductor parameters are outlined in the appendix .    in discussing spe models it should also be noted that molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations are also informative when attempting to identify the spe mechanism .",
    "these simulations describe the structure and rearrangement of atoms at the @xmath3-@xmath0 interface during spe on a microscopic scale .",
    "early models attributed the spe mechanism to the motion of a dangling bond type defect.@xcite this defect aided the rearrangement of atoms at the interface via bond - breaking .",
    "more recently , bernstein _",
    "et al . _ have shown that the spe may occur through a number of both simple and complex mechanisms.@xcite by using empirical potential simulations they have found that one simple mechanism involves the rotation of two atoms aided by coordination defects which are locally created and annihilated during crystallization .",
    "an example of a more complex mechanism involves the migration to the interface of a five - fold coordinated defect which aides the incorporation of two atoms into the crystal matrix . if the md simulations accurately model the spe process then doubt is cast on the generally accepted idea that spe occurs through a single , thermally - activated process . a more complex model would probably then be needed to describe the electronic effects in spe .    mattoni _ et al . _",
    "have also described the segregation and precipitation of b during spe in highly doped si.@xcite this is shown to result in the retardation of the spe rate and is in agreement with experiment.@xcite however , dopant - enhanced spe is not considered .",
    "indeed , all md simulations are performed near the melting point of amorphous silicon in order to ensure reasonable simulation times .",
    "there are no md simulations that we know of that have been performed in the temperature range considered in the present work where the effect of the dopants on the spe rate becomes apparent ( as can be seen at the lower temperatures in fig .",
    "[ asdata]-[bdata ] ) .",
    "if such md simulations become possible , dopant - enhanced spe may be understood to a greater extent on the microscopic level and could then be used to assess the applicability of the gfls model .",
    "the kinetics of dopant - enhanced spe were measured in buried @xmath0-si layers formed by self - ion - implantation in @xmath4-type , @xmath38 , si(100 ) czochralski grown wafers .",

    "the implant fluences were scaled to obtain a range of peak concentrations between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "spe rate enhancement is generally immeasurable at lower concentrations and approaches the solid solubility limit at concentrations higher than this range .",
    "the dopant concentrations were relatively constant over the depth range : 0.45 - 0.85 , 0.5 - 0.8 , 0.95 - 1.35 and 0.8 - 1.15  @xmath46 for as , p , b and al , respectively .",

    "spe enhancement at lower al concentrations is consistent with other dopants , however , the general variation with temperature is different .",

    "a calculation to see how the free fitting parameters might respond to a 10% dopant concentration error was also made .",

    "the values of @xmath69 and @xmath26 in tables  [ gandden ] and  [ ganddep ] are reasonable in that the degeneracies are not expected to be large and the values of @xmath69 are consistent with the energy levels of typical charged defects in @xmath3-si such as v@xmath71 ( which , for example is ( @xmath72  ev)).@xcite the degeneracy for as is close to 0.5 which is consistent with a negatively charged db defect .",
    "the degeneracy for b is 1.5 which is somewhat higher than the value of unity that we expect of a positively charged db .",

    "if @xmath26 is held fixed during fitting they become more consistent as can be seen in the middle column of the tables .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that some appropriate parameters or temperature dependences may not be properly incorporated into the model .",
    "the degeneracy was also set to the values expected of a db .",
    "again , fits to the as , p and b data sets with degeneracy values fixed at these values were reasonable while the energy level values tended to increase with decreases in the degeneracy factor . for the db",
    "degeneracy values , the energy level of the positively charged defect tended to be greater than its negatively charged counterpart .",
    "this trend is similar to that predicted by mosley and paesler in their electric field model except that their energy levels were much closer to the center of the band gap.@xcite fits to al - enhanced data with fixed degeneracy values were quite poor as the lower degeneracy forced the greatest rate enhancement to be at the lowest temperatures - the opposite trend to the actual data .",

    "this figure illustrates the systematic error that exists in fitting our data .",
    "apart from the al data , which shows anomalous spe behaviour , all other trends show a similar gradient . in terms of the dopant concentration , one way of removing these trends from the data would be by modifying the values of @xmath73 used in our calculations . to fit the trends we would require @xmath73 to be underestimated and for the degree of underestimation to increase with dopant concentration .",
    "for example , to make @xmath74 for @xmath75 @xmath76 the concentration must be underestimated by a factor of 2.8 .",
    "this suggests that the appropriate dopant concentration dependences may not be included in the physical parameters outlined in the appendix .",
    "in addition , the concentration dependence of the bgn shifts @xmath25 by a value too small to explain the observed effect",

    "when doped the fermi level on the @xmath3-si side will shift in order to satisfy charge neutrality . in @xmath0-si , it will generally remain pinned to mid - gap due to the high density of localized states in the center of the band gap . the band structure at the position of the spe defect residing at the interface can be varied with a weighting function of the form    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the weighting factor and @xmath89 is the fermi level of @xmath0-si .",

    "the concentration dependence of bgn arises through the interaction of carriers created thermally with carriers introduced by the dopant and the dopant ion itself.@xcite an exact description of this narrowing has been controversial because optical and electrical measurements give different results with the latter yielding considerably higher bgn values .",
    "klaassen has presented a unified apparent bgn function.@xcite this formulation has brought together the disparate data from optical and electrical measurements by correcting the transport equations used in models to interpret electrical data with new accurate values of the intrinsic carrier concentration reported by green.@xcite this formulation also agrees fairly well for dopant concentrations between @xmath141 and @xmath43 to a recent theoretical model proposed by schenk based on quantum mechanical principles using a full random phase approximation.@xcite      the effective dos is used to calculate the concentration of carriers in the conduction and valence bands in eq .",
