    "a so far unique possibility to study a gauge model at finite density is afforded by two color qcd , which can be studied via numerical simulations even at non  zero chemical potential . in our first paper @xcite ( hereafter hklm )",
    "we have studied the model at zero temperature , presenting the first _ ab initio _ spectrum calculation at finite baryon density with full fermion feedback . here",
    "we focus on the effect of temperature : we discuss the interplay of bulk thermodynamics observables , deconfinement and chiral symmetry by varying the chemical potential at different temperatures , and we contrast the nature of the phenomena along the temperature and density axes .",
    "ultimately , we would like to understand the phase diagram of two color qcd , the nature of the critical lines separating the phases with different realisation of chiral symmetries and their interplay with the deconfinement and topological transitions . finally , and ideally",
    ", we would also like to use some of the results on two color qcd to learn something about three color qcd .",
    "clearly the present study , which addresses only a subset of these issues on a small @xmath4 lattice is just exploratory : we stress that even the `` simple '' @xmath5 limit , whose study was initiated many years ago in @xcite , has a number of interesting open problems@xcite .",
    "a rich pheonomenology at finite baryon density emerges from the analysis of model hamiltonians with the same global symmetries as qcd@xcite . for two colors the predictions of these more sophisticated studies reduce to those expected of qualitative reasoning and early calculations @xcite .",
    "simple models and qualitative reasoning , clearly , do not take fully into account details of the dynamics such as color forces and their temperature dependence : perhaps some of the lattice results can offer some quantitative control , and further insight into model studies , and , very optimistically , even the possibility of a first principle derivation of some of their relevant parameters ( e.g. form factors ) .",
    "this provides a further motivation for this lattice study of two color qcd .",
    "an overview of the parameter space explored by the numerical simulations is given in section ii , while the results for the quark-(anti)quark potential are presented in section iii .",
    "section iv discusses the particle number , and the `` nuclear matter phase '' .",
    "section v presents the data for the susceptibilities , contrasting the high density and high temperature behaviour . in section",
    "vi we further assess the rle of the chemical potential into the gauge dynamics by carrying out a partial quenched calculation , and present some speculative comments on the relationships of two and three color qcd .",
    "we close with a summing up and outlook .",
    "some of the results of this paper have been briefly mentioned in @xcite .",
    "using the same algorithm as in hklm we studied the thermodynamics of the system on a @xmath4 lattice at :    * @xmath6 , @xmath7 , mass = ( .07 , .05 ) ; * @xmath8 , @xmath9 , mass = ( .1 , .07 , .05 ) ; * @xmath5 , @xmath10 , mass = .1 .",
    "the chemical potential explores the range of interest , up to the lattice saturation , while the temperature ranges from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . by contrasting the results obtained at @xmath8 with those obtained at @xmath6",
    "we shall study how the temperature effects the chemical potential dependence . by contrasting the results as a function of chemical potential with those obtained by varying the temperature we shall compare the nature of the high t and the high @xmath0 transitions .",
    "wherever available we rely on the results for condensates and susceptibilities obtained in hklm .    clearly to study the chemical potential dependence at different temperature we need to know in which phase we are in at @xmath5 .",
    "our first task is then ( approximately ) locate the critical line in the @xmath13mass plane .",
    "to this end we measured the mass dependence of the chiral condensate .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbp_vs_mass ] we show the chiral condensate as a function of the bare mass for different values of the chemical potential at @xmath8 .",
    "we note that , while a linear extrapolation from masses .1 and .07 would give a non  zero condensate , an extrapolation which uses masses .07 and .05 would suggest that chiral symmetry is already restored .",
    "in addition to that , for mass = .05 we observed a clear two state signal in the hmd history of the chiral condensate , which , to a lesser extent , was also visible at mass = .07 .",
    "[ fig : pbp_vs_mass ] should be considered together with the analogous one ( fig .",
    "3 ) of hklm from which we inferred that the points @xmath6 , mass = .05 and .07 are in the phase where @xmath14 . assuming a first order chiral transition in @xmath13 at @xmath15 , we would conclude that the chiral transition line in the @xmath16 plane runs close to the points @xmath17 .",
    "we sketch such a line in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_b ] , with the caveat that if the @xmath15 transition were instead second order , the line drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_b ] would indicate a crossover . given the exploratory nature of this study",
    "this distinction is immaterial . in the same figure",
    "we also show the locations of the simulation points @xmath18 , and @xmath19 : by switching on the chemical potential we should be able to observe the effect of a finite density of quarks on a variety of dynamical situations , ranging from `` very cold '' ( filled points ) , to `` critical '' ( shaded points ) to `` hot '' ( open point ) .",
    "in addition to this , the line @xmath20 has been explored at @xmath5 for several @xmath21 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbp_vs_mass ] it is also shown the dependence of the chiral condensate on the chemical potential . as expected , when @xmath0 is increased the chiral condensate extrapolates to zero in the chiral limit also for larger bare masses .",
    "we remind that , of course , this does not correspond to the restoration of the chiral symmetry as the chiral condensate will be rotated to a baryonic diquark one ( see the discussions in hklm , and below , for more ) . figs .",
    "[ fig : pbp_vs_mu ] show the same @xmath22 data plotted as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "again , the findings at this largest temperature should be contrasted with those obtained in hklm which we reproduce for the reader s convenience in the upper part of the figure . at @xmath6 ,",
    "mass = .07 we observe a rather sharp drop in the chiral condensate at @xmath23 , close to the half the pion mass , @xmath24 .",
    "we also note that at @xmath8 , @xmath25 @xmath26 , and @xmath27 lies somewhere in the crossover region as it should .",
    "the overall observation resulting from fig .",
    "[ fig : pbp_vs_mass ] is that the density transition shows the expected softening at smaller masses and higher temperatures .",
    "although the results for @xmath22 look physical , and consistent with expectations , we would have obtained similar ones by use of the quenched approximation : we are not really observing qualitative , dynamical @xmath0 effects .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the dynamics of the gauge fields , and to this end we measured the correlations @xmath28 of the zero momentum polyakov loops , averaged over spatial directions .",
    "remember that this quantity is related to the string tension @xmath29 via @xmath30 .",
    "note that as @xmath31 is a real quantity the polyakov loop correlator defining the strength of the quark - quark interaction @xmath32 would be the same as the quark ",
    "antiquark one @xmath33 .",
    "this would lead to the conclusion that the diquarks and mesons with the same spin and opposite parity are always degenerate , since their binding forces are the same . in principle",
    "this conclusion is limited to the heavy spectrum , however the numerical results presented in hkml support this point of view : mesons and diquarks seem to remain degenerate in su(2 ) at any nonzero density , once the fermi level shift is taken into account , producing four degenerate particles at large @xmath0 .",
    "we show the results for the polyakov loop correlators in fig .",
    "[ fig : polcor ] , where we compare the behaviour at various temperature ( upper ) with that at various chemical potentials ( lower ) .",
    "we note that the trends with temperature and chemical potential are quite similar : in both cases we have signs of long range ordering , i.e. deconfinement .",
    "the gap between the plateaus having @xmath34 and @xmath35 in fig .",
    "3b suggests increased fermion screening and the passage to a deconfined phase .",
    "we have then a direct evidence of the effect of the chemical potential on the gauge fields .    finally , we show ( fig . [",
    "fig : poltot ] ) the dependence of the polyakov loop itself on the chemical potential , contrasted , in the lower part of the figure , with that of the spatial polyakov loop .",
    "this suggests that the ordering effects of the chemical potential only affects the temporal direction .",
    "we should also note that some distinction between the behaviour of temporal and spacial polyakov loop is also seen in the temperature dependence , and can be tentatively ascribed to an effect of the different boundaries for the fermion fields ( periodic vs. antiperiodic ) in space and time direction .",
    "according to the standard wisdom for a chemical potential comparable with the baryon mass , baryons start to be produced thus originating a phase of cold , dense matter . for su(2 ) baryons ( diquarks ) are bosons ( as opposed to the fermionic baryons of real qcd ) .",
    "this has major implications on the physics of the dense phase .",
    "first , and obviously , the thermodynamics of ( interacting ) bose and fermi gases is different .",
    "in particular , it could be that the energetics favours the condensations of bosons .",
    "this would be revealed by a non ",
    "zero diquark condensate @xcite , which still breaks chiral symmetry , and should be reflected by different functional dependence of the particle density on @xmath0 which can thus characterise the various phases .    in this exploratory study",
    "we just ( try to ) fit the data to a cubic spline , appropriate from free massless fermion at zero temperature , and try to infer from that the effect of temperature , and the possibility of a condensed diquark phase . in figs .",
    "[ fig : lognum_vs_mu ] we show the number density as a function of @xmath0 for the two @xmath21 values , with superimposed the fits described below .",
    "let us consider @xmath8 ( our warmer lattice , close to @xmath36 ) first : we note the following features . at small chemical potential",
    "there is a clear dependence on the bare mass , which is greatly reduced in the thermodynamical region .",
    "this could be ascribed to a loss of the dynamical mass . in the same region ,",
    "the behaviour is close to @xmath37 ( the line connecting the point is the polynomial @xmath38 ) .",
    "we just note here that a simple , pure cubic term accommodates the data well suggesting a free quark gas  somewhat surprisingly , the contribution of the temperature term seems to be small @xcite . at @xmath6",
    "the situation is different . for @xmath39",
    ", we would expect diquark condensation . at the same time , we have observed long distance screening and deconfinement , so the behaviour might get closer to that of a cold phase of free quarks , which , however , is not supported by the data : as the diquark states appear to be bound ( hklm ) , their condensates can still influence the thermodynamics .",
    "the polynomial fits @xmath40 for mass = .05 , @xmath41 for mass = .07 are not amenable to any simple intepretation .",
    "we might well expect a rather complicated `` mixed '' nuclear matter phase , with an admixtures of diquark gas ( which , if alone , would constitute a `` pure '' su(2 ) nuclear matter ) , condensed diquarks , free quarks , perhaps characterised by both types of condensates ( such mixed phases are also predicted by more detailed instanton studies @xcite ) . a direct measure of diquark condensate should completely clarify this point @xcite .",
    "a free massless quark phase , with complete restoration of chiral symmetry ( i.e. @xmath42 ) could be reached at even larger @xmath0  as this region is dominated by lattice saturation artifacts , improved / perfect actions @xcite might be necessary to explore it .",
    "clearly to better understand the thermodynamics results shown above it is useful to assess the particle content of the model , together with their possible condensation .",
    "remember that at @xmath5 the model has a lattice analogous of the pauli  grsey symmetry mixing quarks and antiquarks which belong to equivalent representation .",
    "main consequences are 1 .",
    "the only discernable condensate is @xmath43 , 2 .",
    "the preferred direction of @xmath44 is picked by the explicit mass term 3 .",
    "the diquark condensate is a natural object which does not break any more symmetry than the ordinary condensate 4 .",
    "there are massless baryons ( diquarks ) .",
    "when @xmath45 the symmetry group is smaller , coincident with that of staggered fermions , and the number of goldstone modes is reduced accordingly .",
    "we refer to hklm for more detailed discussions , and just reproduce here the basic idea and definitions used in spectroscopy calculations .    as usual we form meson and diquark operators by taking correlations of the quark propagator in the appropriate sector of quantum numbers .",
    "we shall limit ourselves to the local sector of the spectrum and focus on the zero momentum _",
    "connected _ propagators of the scalar and psudoscalar mesons and diquarks .",
    "the scalar meson propagator will thus be an isovector , which we will call @xmath46 , following qcd notation .    by applying a generic o(2f ) transformation to the mass term @xmath47",
    "we identify the basic set of operators which shall be used to build the spectrum :    @xmath48    where the lower index labels colour .",
    "the first line displays the usual pseudoscalar and scalar operators .",
    "the second ( third ) line corresponds to diquark ( antiquark ) operators , scalar and pseudoscalar .",
    "this simple minded quantum number assignment can be done by considering that quark  quark and quark - antiquark pairs have opposite relative parity , and is confirmed by a more rigorous analysis presented in hklm .",
    "consider now quark propagation from a source at 0 to the point @xmath49 .",
    "the propagator @xmath50 ( @xmath51 color index ) is an su(2 ) matrix :    @xmath52    the meson ( @xmath53 ) and diquark ( @xmath54 ) and antidiquark ( @xmath55 ) propagators at @xmath5 are constructed from @xmath50 as follows:-    @xmath56    the notable feature of the propagators at @xmath5 is the exact degeneracies of the pion , scalar @xmath54 and scalar @xmath55 and of the scalar meson , pseudoscalar @xmath54 and pseudoscalar @xmath55 .",
    "we then identify two orthogonal directions in the chiral space : + a ) @xmath57 -scalar diquark - scalar antidiquark + b ) @xmath46 - pseudoscalar diquark - pseudoscalar antidiquark    all this at @xmath58 .    by increasing the temperature",
    "the `` pauli  grsey '' lattice symmetry is preserved , so the above degeneracies remain true .",
    "chiral condensate is reduced without changing direction , so the six susceptibilities will progressively become degenerate , and there will be no residual goldstone particle .",
    "this behaviour is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : b_i_mass_mu0 ] where we plot the susceptibilities as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the behaviour of the susceptibilities as a function of the chemical potential has been discussed in hklm .",
    "this is suggestive of a rotation in chiral space of the condensate , from the direction `` parallel '' to @xmath22 to that `` parallel '' to @xmath59 .",
    "in hklm we have noticed that `` conventional '' observables used to monitor chiral symmetry ( pion , @xmath46 , chiral condensate ) display a behaviour similar to that observed at finite temperature .",
    "while we confirm this finding at qualitative level , we also note a quantitative difference : pion and @xmath46 become exactly degenerate at high density , while at high temperature a splitting remains  not surprisingly , of course , since the bare mass is not zero .",
    "it is the apparent _ exact _ degeneracy observed for bare masses of comparable value at high density , for both @xmath13 values , which is sort of puzzling .",
    "the qualitative trend observed at @xmath8 and @xmath6 is quite similar : see fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_i_b1.5 ] , to be contrasted with fig . 5 of hklm .",
    "in figs . [",
    "fig : mu_ibps_mass ] the susceptibility in the scalar diquark channel is plotted as a function of the bare mass for various chemical potentials at @xmath13 = 1.3 and @xmath13 = 1.5 .",
    "it looks as though the signal form the scalar ( and pseudoscalar alike ) diquark susceptibilities in the chiral limit would be , in any case , much smaller than @xmath22 at zero chemical potential .",
    "it has to be stressed that the meaning of this exercise is simply to check how strong the indication of `` rotation '' detected with this procedure would be in the chiral limit .",
    "in addition to that , there the usual caveats associated with the small lattice size , and poor mass sample apply .",
    "these warnings issued , there might well be two effects on the chiral condensate while increasing @xmath0 : one is indeed a rotation in chiral space , one is a reduction of its magnitude similar to that observed at high temperature .",
    "to gain further insight into the `` dynamical''role of the chemical potential , and its effect on the gauge fields , we can take a look at a toy @xcite version of the model , obtained by inverting the dirac operator at nonzero chemical potential in a background of gauge fields generated at zero chemical potential .",
    "for these configurations the potential is obviously always `` hard '' , identical to that at @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bps_toy_1 ]  we show the scalar diquark propagator for @xmath61 evaluated on two different configurations .",
    "interestingly , we have found that in this case the behaviour of the diquarks propagators resembles that of the infamous quenched su(3 ) `` baryonic pions '' measured in @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the nature of the interquark forces and the deconfinement transition might well play a major role in the condensation phenomena , and thus in the critical behaviour , for su(2 ) and su(3 ) alike .",
    "it is essential to have the correct quark  quark and quark  antiquark forces , since they control and soften diquark condensations , including the pathological ones ( which of course should disappear in a correct su(3 ) calculation ) . in a correct qcd algorithm",
    "the `` baryonic pion '' condensation would not take place as the potential become weaker , and the pathological onset at @xmath62 would disappear .",
    "our work in this paper stressed those aspects which are instrumental to study the influence of the gauge field dynamics on the phenomena expected at finite baryon density .",
    "temperature dependence is an important tool in this context .",
    "a `` toy '' model , where the gauge field dynamics is not affected by the chemical potential , proven informative as well .",
    "although our calculations have not been intended as anything more than exploratory ( remember everything was carried out on a @xmath4 lattice ) we feel we have nonetheless managed to learn something from them , which we summarise here .",
    "we have investigated the interquark potential and found evidence of enhanced screening when a nonzero density is induced in the system , as seen in a larger plateau at large spatial separation .",
    "we underscore that the plateau builds in is at the onset of the thermodynamics , i.e. when the number density starts deviating appreciably from zero .",
    "this supports the results of heavy quarks su(2 ) studies that a small density of quarks induces `` deconfinement '' @xcite  these observations are clearly semiqualitative and in particular the nature and the very exhistence of a nuclear matter state in su(2 ) should be subjected to a more careful scrutiny , as discussed in the body of the paper .",
    "temporal and spatial polyakov loops behave in different ways , the latter being nearly insensitive to the chemical potential , suggesting the expect different spatial and temporal ordering predicted by instanton models .",
    "these observations might offer some further insight into polyakov loop models @xcite .",
    "simple inspection of the heavy quark potential symmetries supports the numerical findings of hklm , that for any non  zero chemical potential the ( rather heavy ) particle degeneracies noted at @xmath5 remain true , once the fermi level shift is taken into account .",
    "this would lead to the four degenerate particles at large chemical potential , when pion and @xmath46 , and scalar and pseudoscalar diquark , are degenerate .",
    "interestingly , this pattern emerges from a recent model study @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the number density changes qualitatively with temperature .",
    "despite the many uncertainties described in the text , it seems anyway clear that screening and deconfinement compete against condensation , and this is better seen on on a `` warmer '' lattice , close , yet below @xmath36 : there @xmath2 , consistent with a free , massless quark gas , suggesting the existence of a critical temperature for diquark condensation ( i.e. a temperature beyond which diquarks will not condense at any value of the chemical potential ) smaller than @xmath36 itself .",
    "the behaviour of the susceptibilities suggests that there are two effects on the chiral condensate while increasing @xmath0 : one is a rotation in chiral space , one is a reduction of its magnitude ( occuring in the chiral limit ) similar to that we have observed at high temperature .",
    "the caveats have been spelled out above , and probably only a direct measure of the diquark condensate @xcite can clarify this point .",
    "assuming it is confirmed , there are two possible consequences stemming from this observation .",
    "in the first place , again , this suggests that there is a critical temperature for diquark condensation : when temperature is high enough the magnitude of the condensate will `` shrink '' to zero at rather small @xmath0 , leading to a complete realisation of the chiral symmetry @xmath63 .",
    "secondly , it could be that this effects ultimately leads to the same complete restoration of chiral symmetry at large density even in the cold phase .",
    "concerning the comparison of high temperature and high density behaviour , we noticed two interesting , and to our mind puzzling features : while at high density we observe a complete degeneracies among the chiral partners , at high temperature we observe the residual splitting expected of nonzero bare masses ; we do not know where this difference which is numerically quite clear come from .",
    "at the same time , we have not observed any significant difference between the polyakov loop correlations at large t and large @xmath0 .",
    "instanton models predict different ordering at large t and @xmath0  `` instanton - anti - instanton '' pairs at high t and `` polymers '' at high density ( see second entry of @xcite , and @xcite )  it would be nice to detect these phenomena in a lattice simulations .",
    "this would require more sensitive observables , among which the topological ones , besides lattice instanton studies , seem to be particularly promising .",
    "we are now exploring the behaviour of the topological susceptibility , and space  time correlations of topological charge : this should hopefully shed light on these and other relevant aspects @xcite .",
    "we stress that what has been skecthed here constitute a possible coherent scenario _ not inconsistent _ with the present data , but _ certainly not _",
    "implied by it .",
    "further studies are necessary to sharpen our understanding and this will certainly require a larger set of chemical potentials and simulations in the scaling region .",
    "it is also appropriate to reiterate that according to ref .",
    "@xcite the theory with two colors and eight continuum flavour should be in the conformal phase , however we have not detected any indication of unconventional behaviour .",
    "either we are too far from the continuum limit , so that the continuum results do not apply , and/or the nature of this new phase is not manifest in our calculation @xcite .",
    "one the dark side this issues yet another warning on these results , on the bright side this adds to the interest of the model .",
    "a challenging question remains as to whether we can learn anything useful for real qcd .",
    "of course , as two color qcd baryons are completely degenerate with mesons , the system is not a good approximation to real qcd - symmetries and spectrum of two and three color qcd are certainly dramatically different .",
    "however there might well be a continuity of the dynamical effects from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "a good example comes from the behavious of the diquark coupling @xcite .",
    "another from the results of the last section which suggested that similar dynamical effects should take place when going from `` toy '' to full dynamics in two and three color qcd .",
    "in addition , if we accept that the instanton picture for `` real '' qcd is correct , and take into account that instantons should be described as configurations belonging to the su(2 ) subgroup of su(3 ) @xcite , we might even speculate that the two color results would be closer to the real world than expected .",

    "<S> the rotation of the chiral condensate to a baryonic condensate , as inferred from the susceptibilities , might occur together with a reduction of its magnitude in the chiral limit , possibly leading to a critical temperature for diquark condensation smaller than the deconfinement temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we further asses the rle of the chemical potential into the gauge dynamics by carrying out a partial quenched calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate on the relevance , or lack thereof , of our findings to real qcd . </S>"
