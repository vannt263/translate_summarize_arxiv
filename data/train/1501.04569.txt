    "the main motivation for our study presented in this paper was `` the @xmath3 anomaly '' at the lhc , i.e. deviations of the total cross sections for resonant @xmath0 production measured by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments from their theoretical predictions , as shown in table  [ tab : ww - xsec ] .",
    "the cross sections measured by atlas at the collision energies of @xmath8tev and @xmath9tev are higher respectively by factors of @xmath10 and @xmath11 than the theoretical predictions of the nlo qcd calculations obtained from the mcfm program @xcite .",
    "the corresponding factors for the cms measurements are @xmath12 and @xmath11 .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : ww - xsec ]    although each of these deviations does not exceed @xmath13 , the fact that they are present in four measurements and all exhibit excess of data with respect to theory may indicate that there exist some extra processes contributing to the measured cross sections that have not been taken into account in the theoretical predictions .",
    "such processes may have an important impact on the significance of the higgs - boson signals at the lhc .",
    "since the observed @xmath0 cross section discrepancies at @xmath14 tev are by a factor of @xmath15 higher than the expected contribution coming from the standard model ( sm ) higgs - bosons decays , special measurement procedures were used by the atlas and cms collaborations , see e.g.   refs .",
    "@xcite , to increase their sensitivities to the higgs signal .",
    "the normalisation of the predicted background was rescaled to fit the data in the monitoring region , where the higgs contribution is negligible",
    ". then the rescaled background was used in the higgs - search region to determine the strength of the higgs signal .    in the case of the atlas experiment ,",
    "the normalisation of the theoretical predictions for the background was multiplied by a factor of @xmath11 for the @xmath14 tev analysis of the @xmath1-jet @xmath16 events @xcite , where the sensitivity to the higgs boson decays is the highest .",
    "this value is compatible with the discrepancy of the measured and predicted total cross sections for the resonant @xmath0 production at @xmath14 tev , see table  [ tab : ww - xsec ] .",
    "the actual value of the rescaling factor for the cms analysis is not explicitly quoted in the their papers .",
    "therefore , the cms data will not be used in the presented analysis .    in this paper",
    "we shall make a bold _ assumption _ that the missing process accounting for the cross - section discrepancy , not considered so far in the calculations of the theoretical cross sections , is the double drell  yan process ( ddyp ) resulting from double - parton scattering ( dps ) in proton  proton collisions .",
    "it should be stressed that the strength of ddyp can , at present , be neither directly constrained by experimental data nor predicted theoretically .",
    "if one includes ddyp as a contributor to the @xmath0 production processes , it is bound to contribute as well to the @xmath2 production processes with a fully constrained strength .",
    "the immediate question which may be asked is if after adding the ddyp contribution to the higgs boson searches background , both in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 channels , there would still be a need to include the contribution coming from the higgs - boson decays or , putting it alternatively , to which extent the ddyp contribution , on top of curing the @xmath3 anomaly , could mimic the higgs - boson signal in the @xmath17 gev higgs - sensitive phase - space regions .    to answer this question we present a coherent analysis of the ddyp contribution to the @xmath18 and @xmath19 decay - channel backgrounds .",
    "we use the data corresponding to the total integrated luminosity collected so far at the lhc .",
    "once the overall normalisation of the ddyp contribution is fixed to explain the @xmath3 anomaly , our ddyp model does not have any more free parameters , thus can be easily falsified by comparing its predictions to experimental data .",
    "the ddyp contribution to the higgs searches background in the @xmath19 decay channel was already analysed in our previous work @xcite . using a simplified model of ddyp",
    ", we have demonstrated the appearance of a peak in the four - lepton invariant mass , @xmath20 , distribution in the @xmath21 gev higgs signal region . this ",
    "higgs - like \" peak is not driven by the details of the ddyp model .",
    "it is generated by the interplay of a steeply falling @xmath20 distribution and the kinematical threshold effect driven by the experimental cuts on the outgoing leptons variables : the minimal transverse momenta of leptons and the minimal invariant mass of the opposite charge lepton pairs .",
    "these cuts are similar in the atlas and cms analyses , and therefore result in similar ddyp peak positions within a @xmath22 gev interval .",
    "it has to be stressed that the claim of the atlas and cms collaborations that ddyp can be neglected as a potentially alarming source of background was based on the assumption of uncorrelated : ( 1 ) longitudinal momentum , ( 2 ) transverse position , ( 3 ) flavour , ( 4 ) charge and ( 5 ) spin of the partons taking part in ddyp , and on the assumption of the process - independent value of @xmath23 , governing the strength of the dps processes .",
    "the above , in our view unjustified , assumptions lead to a significant underestimation of the contribution of ddyp to the higgs searches background . as we argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , its contribution must be , given the lack of the adequate theoretical calculations , determined experimentally , e.g.  by using the experimental methods proposed therein and in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section we present numerical results of our analysis .",
    "section  3 includes a discussion of the results as well as a general discussion of the interplay between the ddyp and gluon  gluon scattering contributions .",
    "it contains a proposal of measurements capable to elucidate the role of ddyp in @xmath3 and @xmath2 production processes .",
    "finally , section  4 concludes our paper .",
    "the numerical results presented below have been obtained using the monte carlo event generator winhac @xcite with the same model of ddyp and the same input parameters as in our previous paper @xcite .    the starting point to our quantitative studies in this paper",
    "is a shape analysis of the two - lepton mass , @xmath24 , distribution and its fit to the `` @xmath25-jets '' final - state data presented by the atlas collaboration in a wide @xmath24 range for the full data statistics at @xmath9tev in ref .",
    "@xcite .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : ww]a we present the results of the atlas collaboration of ref .",
    "@xcite for the collision energy of @xmath9tev . the rescaled background and",
    "the higgs decays contributions are shown separately .",
    "this plot reflects the necessity of including the higgs contribution to obtain a satisfactory description of the @xmath24 distribution in the region of its small values , where the sensitivity to the @xmath17 gev higgs boson is the highest .    for the plot presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ww]b we re - normalise back the background distribution to its original , canonical theoretical predictions by dividing the background shown in fig .  [ fig : ww]a by a factor of @xmath11 , and subsequently add the ddyp contribution with a normalisation of its prediction determined by minimisation of @xmath26 in the fit of the sum of the ddyp and theoretical background contributions to the data .",
    "the higgs contribution is no longer necessary to obtain a satisfactory description of the data by the canonical background model if the ddyp contribution is included .    indeed , the values of @xmath26 corresponding to the @xmath24 distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : ww ] are @xmath27 for the  rescaled background plus the sm higgs \" scenario ( with the @xmath28-value equal to @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 for the ",
    "canonical background plus the ddyp \" scenario ( with @xmath28-value equal to @xmath31 ) .",
    "both descriptions of the data are acceptable on a statistical basis , although the obtained values of the likelihood test give some better preference to the  ddyp plus canonical background \" predictions .",
    "we stress again that in the latter case the theoretical predictions of the sm background do not need to be rescaled to describe the data , as it was done in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "having determined the normalisation of ddyp cross section using the @xmath0 channel , we can now study the corresponding ddyp contribution to the @xmath20 distribution for the @xmath2 channel . in our model",
    "the dominant contribution to the ddyp cross section comes form the @xmath32 excitations of the proton sea . thus",
    ", the relative normalisation of the ddyp contributions for the @xmath0 and @xmath2 channels is driven , on the modelling side , only by the relative strength of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 excitations , reflecting the ratio of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 pdfs ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the experimental side ,",
    "it reflects the relative efficiencies of selection of @xmath0 and @xmath2 events in their kinematical acceptance regions and @xmath2 spectra we select events according to the selection criteria used for the higgs searches in the corresponding decay channels .",
    "we assume the same efficiency of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 event selection and neglect the detector smearing effects . ] .",
    "the ddyp model predictions for the @xmath2 channel are thus fully constrained .    again , as for the @xmath0 channel , the atlas data at @xmath9tev @xcite are presented first in fig .",
    "[ fig : zz]a with the sm higgs contribution and the canonical background contributions shown separately . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zz]b we replace the higgs contribution by the parameter - free ddyp model predictions .",
    "the values of @xmath26 corresponding to @xmath20 distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : zz ] are @xmath37 for the background plus sm higgs scenario ( with the @xmath28-value equal to @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 for the background plus our ddyp predictions ( with @xmath28-value equal to @xmath40 ) .",
    "both descriptions of data are statistically acceptable , however in this case the sm higgs prediction is slightly more preferred .",
    "in contrast to the sm higgs scenario , ddyp contributes not only to the @xmath20 range near @xmath41gev but also above the threshold of the on - shell @xmath2 production .",
    "we have calculated that with @xmath0-fixed normalisation ddyp will result in @xmath42 extra events in the range of @xmath43 , which agrees at the @xmath44 level with the atlas data excess of @xmath45 events over the sm background @xcite .",
    "cms also observes an excess of the data with respect to the background in this kinematical region at a comparable level of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "our numerical results presented in the previous section show that once the ddyp contribution is normalised to account for the missing contribution to the @xmath0 cross section , one obtains a satisfactory predictions for the excess of events observed by the atlas experiment both in the @xmath24 and @xmath20 distributions .",
    "these excesses of events were attributed by the atlas and cms collaborations to the sm higgs - boson decays to @xmath2 and @xmath0 with @xmath47gev .",
    "the presented results correspond to the two extreme scenarios explaining the excess of the experimental data over the sm background : the `` sm - higgs - only '' and the `` ddyp - only '' .",
    "there is , of course , a possibility that the two could contribute together .",
    "for example , in the case of the @xmath20 distribution , the sm higgs contribution could better describe the peak width in the data in the @xmath41gev region , while ddyp can add some events in this region but also in the higher mass range .",
    "this would lead to a different values of the higgs couplings to the @xmath48 and @xmath49 bosons with respect to those quoted in the canonical atlas and cms analyses which neglect the ddyp contribution altogether .",
    "the intriguing question is if the ddyp contribution could be sufficiently large to mimic fully the higgs signal at the lhc .",
    "an equally important question is why it was not considered as an important background source in the data analyses by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "let us start with the answer to the latter question before addressing the former one .",
    "the ddyp contributions were studied by both collaborations with the help of the standard parton shower monte carlo generators and were found to be negligible .",
    "the reason why these generators predict such small cross sections for ddyp is related to the assumption of a completely uncorrelated two single - parton scattering ( sps ) modelling of two drell  yan processes in a single proton ",
    "proton collision .",
    "the canonical dps models assume the value of the so - called effective double - parton scattering cross section : @xmath50 mb .",
    "this parameter normalises the dps cross section with respect to the product of two sps cross sections , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the above value has been measured , but only for the cases of dps involving at least one gluon in a pair of colliding partons .",
    "there are at least three reasons why the value of @xmath23 may be significantly lower for the same flavour , opposite - charge and spin quark ",
    "antiquark pairs relevant to the @xmath2 and @xmath0 production processes :    * the quark ",
    "antiquark excitations of the proton involves partons of the same flavour .",
    "for example , if an @xmath51-quark takes part in the production of one of the vector bosons , its @xmath52 partner is already present in the wave function of the colliding proton .",
    "this enhances by a large factor , with respect to the canonical picture in which the pdfs of both partons are considered as uncorrelated , the probability that it may take part in the production of the second vector boson . *",
    "the transverse - plane correlation length for the same flavour and opposite charge @xmath32 pairs is significanly smaller than for the gluon ",
    "gluon pairs because of the dominance of the local charge and flavour conserving proton excitations ( note that at the hardness scale of the vector - meson pair production processes and for the @xmath53-region relevant to the higgs searches there is less than one fixed - flavour @xmath32-pair excitation per incoming proton , while there is more than @xmath54 gluon pairs covering uniformly , glueing together , the proton volume . no doubt , the strength of the gluonic dps must reflect the transverse size of the proton , while ddyp should reflect rather the typical size of a quark  antiquark dipole . *",
    "the long - lived @xmath32 excitations within the proton which do not lead to the significant effects modifying its overall spin involve quarks and antiquarks of opposite spins .",
    "collisions of such pairs produce always vector - boson pairs with the total spin equal to zero , as in the case of the higgs - boson decays .",
    "all the above amplification effects can not be calculated within the presently available qcd perturbative methods .",
    "this , however , does not mean that they do not exist .",
    "the lhc provides the unique opportunity to measure the respective quark ",
    "antiquark flavour , transverse plane , longitudinal momentum and spin correlations in the proton .",
    "the @xmath55-pair production processes , where @xmath56 , provide an excellent experimental testing ground for the quark ",
    "antiquark correlation models , in particular if : ( 1 ) data are collected at two or more collider energy settings ( allowing to separate experimentally the quark and gluon originating processes @xcite ) , ( 2 ) the data are collected not only in the @xmath57 but also in the @xmath58 and @xmath59 collision modes ( to control the transverse - plane parton correlations ) and , most importantly , ( 3 ) the ddyp effects are measured both in the higgs - signal and monitoring regions . in addition",
    ", the measurement of the relative strengths of these processes provides a clear experimental test of the robustness of the sm higgs interpretation of the data with respect to alternative mechanisms of the electroweak symmetry braking . as long as such experimental studies are not made ,",
    "the ddyp model should be , in our view , considered as equally plausible as the higgs model in explaining the source of the excesses of events in the @xmath2 and @xmath0 channels observed at the lhc .",
    "finally , let us address a more subtle question of the interplay between ddyp and the electroweak - boson pair production in the gluon ",
    "gluon fusion process .",
    "the latter processes are included in the mcfm program @xcite as well as in the gg2ww @xcite and gg2zz @xcite generators which are used by the atlas and cms collaborations for theoretical predictions of the respective sm background to the higgs signal in its @xmath3 and @xmath2 decay channels .",
    "these calculations include also the so - called crossed - box contribution in which two incoming gluons split into quark ",
    "antiquark pairs and then a quark ( antiquark ) of one pair interacts with an antiquark ( quark ) of the second pair , leading to ddyp .",
    "one may , therefore , think that the processes we consider in this paper are already included in the theoretical predictions of the sm background to the respective higgs signals .    in our opinion ,",
    "the gluon ",
    "gluon fusion calculations include only partially the ddyp contribution and may even underestimate the included crossed - box diagram effects .",
    "firstly , they take into account only on - shell incoming gluons which are purely left or right - handed , while , as we argue in ref .",
    "@xcite , one should consider all possible gluon polarisations .",
    "for the spin - zero vector boson pairs mimicking the higgs signal , a particular care must be given to the full set of processes producing on - shell and off - shell @xmath32 pairs with compensating spins .",
    "such pairs may be produced by longitudinally polarised gluons but also by the higher - twist effects . to our best knowledge these effects",
    "are not included in the existing theoretical calculations .    as was shown in a detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the crossed - box contributions exhibits a collinear singularity when the spins of the incoming on - shell gluons sum to zero .",
    "the typical collinear singularity is , within the leading - twist approach , damped in this case to the logarithmic ( integrable ) singularity due to the vector structure of qcd for the on - shell initial - state gluons , i.e.  when they are purely left or right - handed @xcite .",
    "off - shellness of longitudinally",
    "polarised gluons should to some extent damp the singularity , but will this reduce the enhancement due to the collinear quark ",
    "antiquark pair emission ?",
    "the question which remains to be answered is not only how frequently the incoming gluons are longitudinally polarised but also what is the probability for the the @xmath32 pair propagating over large distances , before annihilating into a vector - boson pair , to become a spin - zero pair due to soft colour interactions with the medium . in both cases",
    "the total spin of the colliding @xmath32 dipoles is zero , leading to a spin zero configuration of the final vector - boson pairs .",
    "another problematic issue is the question of the renormalisation and factorisation scales . in typical fixed order qcd calculations , as given in refs .",
    "@xcite , these scales are set equal to each other and taken as a hard - process scale . in the case of the processes under consideration this scale is of the order of @xmath60gev .",
    "is using such a high scale justified for processes in which incoming gluons split into almost collinear quark ",
    "antiquark pairs ?",
    "in our opinion it is not . in such cases a better choice for the argument of the running qcd coupling may be not the hard process scale but rather the transverse momentum of the emitted quarks , see e.g.  ref .",
    "generally , this kind of a scale is used in popular qcd parton shower generators .",
    "this is , however , often not the case in the fixed - order qcd calculations .",
    "the value of the running @xmath61 between the scales of @xmath60gev and @xmath62gev is increased by a factor of @xmath63 .",
    "since the considered process involves @xmath64 , we can easily get the enhancement factor of @xmath65 .",
    "the factorisation scale for such collinear splittings should also be set to a similar value .",
    "the effects discussed above should lead to enhancements in low @xmath66 regions of produced electroweak bosons .",
    "this is hard to observe in the case of the @xmath0 production , as the transverse momenta of neutrinos from the leptonic @xmath48-boson decays can not be measured individually , but could be seen rather easily in the @xmath2/@xmath67 processes through their charged lepton decay channels .",
    "therefore , the latter processes can provide an important test of the interplay between the ddyp and gluon  gluon scattering contributions .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the consequences of the hypothesis that the double drell  yan process ( ddyp ) accounts for the excess of the measured @xmath0 cross section with respect to its theoretically predicted value .",
    "this assumption determines the absolute normalisation of the predictions of our simple ddyp model introduced in ref .",
    "this normalisation factor is the only free parameter of the model .",
    "we have demonstrated that adding the above absolutely normalised ddyp contribution to the canonical sm background is sufficient for a satisfactory description of the @xmath20 spectra for the @xmath2 channel and @xmath68 spectra for the @xmath0 channel , with a comparable fit quality as in the model assuming the existence of the sm higgs boson .",
    "we have argued that the ddyp contributions may indeed be significantly larger than that expected in the naive canonical dps models because of the strong charge , flavour , longitudinal momentum , transverse position and spin correlations of the quark ",
    "antiquark pairs participating in ddyp .",
    "such a possibility has not been excluded so far , neither by the theoretical calculations nor by the experimental measurements .",
    "we have presented some theoretical arguments in favour of such a ddyp contribution and proposed a measurement programme to test it experimentally at the lhc .",
    "we would like to thank s.  p.  baranov and j.  r.  gaunt for useful discussions .",
