    "observations of the corona borealis supercluster ( hereafter crb - sc ) with the very small array ( vsa ) extended configuration ( gnova - santos et al . 2005 , hereafter gs05 ) at 33  ghz have shown a decrement in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , with a minimum temperature of @xmath8k at coordinates ra@xmath9 , dec.@xmath10 ( j2000 ) , near the center of the supercluster , in a regionwith no known galaxy clusters .",
    "the explanation of such a strong temperature decrement based only on a primary gaussian cmb anisotropy is extremely unlikely .",
    "this led us to consider the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect generated either by a previously unnoticed galaxy cluster or by a filamentary structure consisting of warm / hot gas in this supercluster as a possible component of this decrement . the sz effect",
    "( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) arises from the inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons by hot electrons and produces decrements in the mean temperature of the cmb at the vsa frequency .",
    "it has been detected in the direction of a number of galaxy clusters ( see e.g. lancaster et al.s 2005 for vsa observations of this effect in galaxy clusters ) ; however , large - scale structures in superclusters , with lower temperatures and baryon overdensities but much larger length scales , may also generate detectable sz signals .",
    "millimetric observations with the mito telescope at 143 , 214 and 272  ghz ( battistelli et al .",
    "2006 ) supported the presence of an sz component , probably on top of a negative primary cmb anisotropy .",
    "recently we have also carried out observations with the new superextended configuration of the vsa ( gnova - santos et al .",
    "2008 , hereafter g08 ) , completely independently and at a different angular resolution of 7 arcmin ( fwhm ) , which confirmed the presence of this decrement .",
    "the gaussianity analyses performed on these data also bore out the results of gs05 . in that work",
    "we also showed that this decrement is also detected in the wmap 5-year data , even though with a lower level of signifiance because of its coarser angular resolution and higher noise .",
    "the joint restrictions set by the vsa decrement and by the absence of significant x - ray signal in the rosat _ all sky survey _ data ( see fig .  9 of gs05 ) put strong constraints on the temperature and density of the gas responsible for such a decrement . in gs05 we estimated that only @xmath110.3 galaxy clusters rich enough to produce such a deep decrement are expected in the entire surveyed region .",
    "also , this cluster hypothesis is further disfavoured by the fact that , due to the absence of any x - ray excess , a distant cluster would be needed , and this is in disagreement with the large angular extension of the decrement . on the other hand , as we showed in gs05 , a filamentary structure of diffuse gas pointing towards us with a temperature 0.6 - 0.8  kev , baryon overdensity @xmath11400 and length @xmath1140  mpc , could account for 50% of the total detected decrement whilst remaining undetected in the rosat data .",
    "this filament would contain a gas mass @xmath12 m@xmath13 .",
    "such structures could provide a location for a significant fraction of the baryon content in the local universe .",
    "in fact , the baryon density at @xmath14 , derived from the total budget over the well - observed components ( fukugita et al .",
    "1998 ) is a factor of @xmath152 lower than that at high redshift , inferred through independent methods , such as the ly@xmath16 forest ( e.g. rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) , the primordial cmb fluctuations ( e.g. rebolo et al.2004 ; spergel et al .",
    "2005 ) or the primordial abundance of deuterium ( tytler et al.1996 ) .",
    "the results of hydrodynamical simulations ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al . 1999 , 2001 ) indicate that a significant fraction of these `` missing baryons '' may be located in a phase of warm / hot gas distributed in diffuse structures on supercluster scales , at temperatures @xmath17 k. basilakos et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have studied the morphology of superclusters by means of hydrodynamical and @xmath18-body simulations in a @xmath19-cdm model .",
    "they found that filamentary structures are very prominent in clusters and superclusters dominated by dark matter .",
    "the gaseous component is , however , predominantly spherical .",
    "if the decrement detected by the vsa is caused by an sz effect arising from a filamentary structure of warm / hot gas along the line of sight , there should be galaxies towards this direction which may be tracing the distribution of this gas .",
    "therefore , an optical study of the galaxy population in this region is useful for determining whether the hypotethical sz effect airses from such a structure or from a farther unknown galaxy cluster . in this paper",
    "we analyse the density , spatial distribution and photometric properties of such galaxies using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  2 describes the main properties of the crb - sc from an optical perspective ; section 3 presents the basic properties of the microwave and optical data used in our study ; section  4 presents the analysis of such data , focusing on the properties of the spatial distribution of galaxies within the vsa cold spot compared with those in clusters and intercluster regions .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  5 .",
    "one of the best examples of known superclusters in the northern sky is the crb - sc .",
    "abell ( 1958 ) first noted the presence of a concentration of clusters of galaxies in the corona borealis region , and included it in his catalogue of second order clusters .",
    "the first dynamical study of the crb - sc was carried out by postman et al .",
    "( 1988 ) through the analysis of a sample of 1,555 galaxies in the vicinity of abell clusters .",
    "they concluded that the mass of each cluster in the core of the crb - sc lies in the range @xmath20 , while the total mass of the supercluster is @xmath21 , which is probably enough to bind the system .",
    "they proved also that the dynamical timescales are comparable with the hubble time , making it unlikely that the system could be virialized .",
    "subsequent work by small et al .",
    "( 1998 ) quoted a value for the mass of crb - sc of @xmath22 .",
    "they remarked that almost one third of the galaxies in the region are not associated with any abell cluster and noted the great contribution to the projected surface density of galaxies of the background cluster abell 2069 and its surrounding galaxies .",
    "this cluster is located at a redshift @xmath23 , suggesting the existence of the so - called abell 2069 supercluster . the number of clusters belonging to crb - sc ranges from six to eight according to postman et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and small et al.(1997 ) respectively .",
    "we will consider here that crb - sc includes eight clusters ( einasto et al .",
    "2001 ) distributed around the position ra=@xmath24 , dec.=@xmath25 , at a redshift @xmath26 .",
    "six clusters ( abell 2061 , 2065 , 2067 , 2079 , 2089 and 2092 ) are located in the core of the supercluster , in a @xmath27 region , while there are another two ( abell 2019 and 2124 ) at an angular distance of @xmath28 from the core .",
    "einasto et al .",
    "( 2001 ) pointed out out abell 2061 and 2065 as the only x - ray emitting clusters .",
    "there are four other abell clusters ( abell 2056 , 2005 , 2022 and 2122 ) in this region at redshifts @xmath26 , two ( abell 2069 and 2083 ) at @xmath29 and another two , abell 2059 and 2073 , in the background at redshifts 0.13 and 0.17 respectively .",
    "other clusters have been detected using the digital sky survey ( gal et al .",
    "2003 ; lopes et al . 2004 ) , the hamburg / rass catalogue ( bade et al .",
    "1998 ) , and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( koester et al . 2007 ) , all of them with just photometric estimates of redshifts . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt for crb - sc a centre of ra=@xmath30 , dec.=@xmath31 and a radius of 2.5 degrees , which corresponds to @xmath32 mpc at the distance of that supercluster .",
    "using the _ _ sdss - dr6 catalogue archive server _ _ by sql queries , we got the catalogues of galaxies selected from the _ sdss galaxy _ file .",
    "the sdss photometric survey covers the entire region of the supercluster , apart from two narrow strips ( see below ) .",
    "we downloaded this catalogue in the region @xmath33 and @xmath34dec.@xmath35 square degrees , and then centred in the vsa cold spot .",
    "there were 5,692,792 objects classified as galaxies in this area .",
    "the extinction in an area of @xmath0 square degrees around the vsa cold spot is small ( 0.060.08 mag in the @xmath36 filter ) producing reddenings @xmath37 . in any case , the analysis presented in this paper uses the unreddened @xmath36 and @xmath38 magnitudes .",
    "we limit our analysis to galaxies with @xmath39 mag , which roughly corresponds to the completeness limits for pointlike objects in the sdss catalogue ( although some of the analysis use subsamples with additional cuts in magnitude ) . at the redshift ( @xmath40 ) of the crb - sc",
    ", @xmath41 mag corresponds to @xmath42 mag , and then our selection includes the full range of giants and @xmath2 mag within the domain of dwarf galaxies in the corona supercluster .",

    "this constraint removes @xmath1 % of the objects , reducing the final number to 3,110,085 in the @xmath36 filter . for some of the analyses presented in this paper",

    "the excess found in the @xmath64 mag slice could be interpreted as the existence of a relatively low mass ( or relatively dark ) cluster at the position of the vsa cold spot and at the redshift of crb - sc .",
    "however , the absence of overdensity in the @xmath65 slice suggests that this concentration of galaxies can not be responsible for the overdensity at fainter magnitudes .",

    "abell clusters are the dominant structures in the maps which show the brighter slice in magnitude .",
    "as we move to fainter cuts in magnitude , the presence of those clusters is less obvious as more and more galaxies from the background are contributing to the maps . in the first three panels the region subtended by the vsa cold spot is within a filament running from se to nw which is slightly overdense with respect to the near environment .",
    "however , the map corresponding to the @xmath5 mag slice ( bottom right ) shows a clear overdensity with a radius @xmath7 arcmin located at the position of the vsa cold spot .",
    "the absence of that overdensity in the @xmath65 slice could indicate the presence of a cluster in crb - sc with a lack of relatively bright galaxies , or alternatively that the concentration of galaxies is in the background of the respect to crb - sc .",

    "a clear overdensity emerges at the position of the vsa cold spot .",
    "this corresponds basically to the structure seen in the @xmath5 mag in figure  [ maps2 ] .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of the spatial distribution of galaxies in the crb - sc , where a cold spot at 33 ghz was found by the vsa instrument working with two different configurations .",
    "we have used the sdss data to analyse the density , and photometric properties of galaxies within the area covered by this spot and compared them with those of galaxies in abell clusters , intercluster regions and in the field .",
    "our main findings are :    * the vsa cold spot is located in the northern part ( 40 arcmin from the centre ) of a region of @xmath0 degree delineated by the clusters abell 2056 , 2065 , 2059 and 2073 , where the density of galaxies is a factor @xmath2 higher with respect to other intercluster regions .",
    "this gives an excess of @xmath66 galaxies up to @xmath56 mag with respect to typical values in the field .",
    "* the region subtended by the vsa cold spot has an overpopulation of galaxies as compared with mean values in random selected areas of the sky .",
    "counting galaxies up to @xmath47 mag in @xmath67 random selected regions in the sky , we showed that the density of galaxies within the spot is @xmath11 1.63.0 higher than the mean value in such control fields with little dependence on the restrictions applied in magnitudes and/or colours . only in @xmath11 13% of such random regions",
    "the density of galaxies is larger than in the vsa cold spot . *",
    "no abell cluster of galaxies is found in the area subtended by the vsa cold spot ( @xmath68 square arcminute below the 3@xmath50 level ) .",
    "the nearest abell cluster is abell 2059 , which has a redshift of 0.1305 and is projected at 26.2 arcmin ( 3.6 mpc at the redshift @xmath69 ) .",
    "the nearest cluster member of crb - sc is abell 2056 projected at 58.9 arcmin ( 4.7 mpc at the redshift of the supercluster ) .",
