    "the interdigitated contacts provide the opportunity to apply both lateral ( perpendicular to the growth direction ) and vertical ( parallel to the growth axis ) electric fields in order to independently control the charge occupancy of the molecule and the quantum coupling between the two qds that comprise the molecule . in this work",
    "we focus on charging of the qdms and always apply the same voltage to both of the top contacts .",

    "the observation that the lowest energy peak dominates at low powers , and that peaks with increasing energy gain optical intensity only at increasing laser powers , indicates that the three peaks are part of a single structure in which carriers can relax to lower energy shells .",
    "emission from excited states becomes possible only as the increasing laser power generates sufficient carriers to populate the lower energy states and inhibit relaxation .",

    "these carriers thermally relax through the ladder of energy states in the lqdm . thermal relaxation in confined structures typically takes place on ps time scales , so emission from excited energy levels is unlikely.@xcite consequently , we assign the lowest energy observed pl peak ( 1202 mev ) to recombination of electrons and holes in their lowest energy states ( @xmath5 and @xmath8 ) .",

    "the asymmetry of envelope functions from different shells ( e.g. s and p ) suppress optical recombination and observed pl is dominated by s to s and p to p transitions .",

    "the intensity of the @xmath6-@xmath9 peak rises as a function of laser power because increased laser intensity increases the probability that the @xmath5 states will be populated by optically injected carriers .",
    "pl emission originating in the @xmath6 energy shell becomes significant only when the @xmath5 states are already filled and relaxation from @xmath6 to @xmath5 is suppressed . by the same argument we assign the third pl peak , centered at 1279 mev , to pl originating in the @xmath7 energy shell .",
    "the measured difference between ensemble pl peak energies @xmath5-@xmath8 and @xmath6-@xmath9 is 40 mev .",

    "transition c has two unpaired holes , but experiments on vqdms indicate that singlet and triplet configurations of holes localized in separate qds are degenerate in energy unless coherent tunneling between the energy levels leads to a kinetic exchange interaction.@xcite because the two qds that comprise the lqdm typically have slightly different energy levels , coherent coupling is unlikely in the absence of any lateral field to tune the energy levels into resonance.@xcite the absence of spin fine structure associated with line c further supports the conclusion that the @xmath9 energy levels are localized to individual qds .    once the applied voltage tunes the @xmath6 shell past the fermi level , electrons begin to fill the states that comprise the @xmath6 shell .",
    "the order in which these states will be filled depends on charge and spin interactions.@xcite whenever the initial state or final state of optical recombination has unpaired electron spins , multiple possible spin configurations are possible and spin fine structure is probable . in fig .",
    "[ e1h1single]d we indicate several weak pl lines that gain optical intensity at the same value of applied voltage as the strong pl lines d and e. although we can not assign these spectral lines to specific charge and spin configurations , the applied voltage controls the number of electrons that occupy the @xmath6 shell .",
    "consequently , a pair of lines that gain optical intensity at the same value of applied voltage most probably originate from states with the same total charge .",
    "the observation of fine structure for line d suggests that the two electrons occupying the @xmath6 shell are located in different discrete energy states .",
    "if these states were localized in individual qds , the energy shifts due to coulomb or spin interactions would be expected to be very small ( 0.5 mev or less ) .",
    "the observed shifts are all more than 1mev ( d : 1.27 mev , e : 2.16 and 3.23 mev ) , further supporting the conclusion that the @xmath6 energy states are delocalized over the entire lqdm .    unlike controlled charging of single ingaas qds,@xcite there is not a well - defined window of applied voltage in which the pl of a single charge configuration dominates .",
    "this suggests that the charge occupancy of the lqdm @xmath6 state is not well defined for any value of applied field .",
    "states with increasing charge occupancy do not become populated until the applied voltage tunes the @xmath6 energy states sufficiently below the fermi level to overcome coulomb interactions and add an additional electron to the @xmath6 energy shell .",
    "for this reason the pl transitions originating in states with increasing number of electrons gain optical intensity at increasing values of the applied voltage .",
    "however , optical recombination of electrons in the @xmath6 states competes against emission from the @xmath5 states , which removes electrons and enables electron relaxation out of the @xmath6 states .",
    "consequently , states of lower charge occupancy can continue to emit even at applied voltages where higher charge occupancy is possible .",
    "spectroscopy of an ensemble of lqdms reveals three pl peaks centered on 1202 mev , 1242 mev and 1279 mev . by analyzing the intensity and center energy of these peaks as a function of laser power and applied voltage , we attribute these peaks to optical recombination of electrons and holes in different energy shells of the lqdms .",
    "spectral maps of single lqdms as a function of applied voltage confirm this assignment .",
    "the spectroscopy of single lqdms also allows us to identify the characteristic spectral shifts associated with electron charging and coulomb interactions .",
    "the magnitude of these shifts supports the conclusion that the @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 energy shells are localized to individual qds while the @xmath6 energy shell is delocalized over the entire lqdm .",
    "the observation of fine structure that may be associated with spin interactions further validates this model .",
    "the delocalized @xmath6 electron states observed here may provide a mechanism for mediating coherent interactions between spins localized in the @xmath5 or @xmath8 energy levels of the two distinct qds that comprise the lqdm .",

    "<S> lateral quantum dot molecules consist of at least two closely - spaced ingaas quantum dots arranged such that the axis connecting the quantum dots is perpendicular to the growth direction . </S>",

    "<S> self - assembled semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) are a promising material for development of next - generation optoelectronic logic devices . a key advantage of these materials is the opportunity to confine single charges whose spin projections could serve as the logical bits for classical or quantum spin - based computing while preserving the opportunity to control these spin projections using ultrafast optical fields . quantum dot molecules ( qdms ) , composed of two coupled qds , have unique properties that enable new methods of controlling and measuring spins.@xcite vertically - stacked quantum dot molecules ( vqdms ) , in which the two qds are stacked along the growth direction , have received the most attention because the vertical growth protocol provides precise and independent control over the height of each qd and the intervening barrier.@xcite in vqdms , the formation of delocalized molecular states with symmetric and antisymmetric molecular orbitals has been clearly established.@xcite the coherent tunneling that leads to the formation of these molecular states can also be used to create entanglement between two spins confined in the separate dots that compose a vqdm.@xcite this approach , however , can not be extended to enable nearest - neighbor interactions for a large number of bit states . </S>",
    "<S> one obstacle is the inability to provide local gates between vertically - stacked qds in order to independently control the interactions between an arbitrary pair of nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> a second obstacle is that the growth - direction electric field that controls the coherent interactions can not simultaneously be used to controllably charge each qd with a single electron or hole whose spin projection can serve as the logical bit .    </S>",
    "<S> lateral quantum dot molecules ( lqdms ) are an alternate qdm configuration in which closely - spaced qds are formed on a single growth plane.@xcite the simplest lqdm is a diatomic - like pair of qds that nucleate from a single site . </S>",
    "<S> lqdms could be the basis of a scalable architecture based on coherent interactions between nearest - neighbors,@xcite but the development and understanding of lqdms lags behind vqdms . </S>",
    "<S> one major obstacle is that the lqdm geometry makes it extremely challenging to deterministically create unique confining potentials for each qd . </S>",
    "<S> a second obstacle is that lqdms typically have a relatively large center - to - center distance that significantly reduces the strength of tunnel coupling . despite these challenges , </S>",
    "<S> lqdms are an important testbed for the development of tools to deterministically electrically charge individual qds in an array while preserving independent electrical and/or optical control over coherent nearest - neighbor interactions . as a first step toward the development of such tools , we embed ingaas lqdms in a three - terminal diode structure and investigate the spectroscopic signatures of charging and charge carrier interactions as controlled by the voltage applied to the diode in the growth direction . </S>",
