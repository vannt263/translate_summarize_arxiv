    "spherically symmetric static newtonian perfect fluid models are the starting point for many discussions about stellar structure and evolution . among the least complicated models are those described by barotropic equations of state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the pressure and @xmath2 the mass density . within this class of models , polytropic equations of state ,",
    "@xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 non - negative constants ) , have been studied thoroughly , and discussions about polytropes can be found in many textbooks on astrophysics ( e.g. , chandrasekhar  @xcite , kippenhahn and weigert  @xcite , shapiro and teukolsky  @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this is at least two - fold : firstly , they are of physical interest , since they often constitute good approximations for certain regions of various types of stars . secondly , the polytropic equations of state give rise to symmetries , which makes the equations more tractable .",
    "in particular , one can introduce so - called homology invariants and thereby reduce the hydrodynamical problem to two coupled autonomous first order ordinary differential equations ( see e.g. , kippenhahn and weigert  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "more realistic stellar models must necessarily go beyond the pure polytropes .",
    "the next level of complexity is to consider more general classes of barotropic equations of state . in astrophysics",
    "numerous equations of state describing different kinds of matter , e.g. , a stellar plasma or a degenerate ideal fermi gas , have been considered and some of the corresponding stellar models have been studied in detail , although mostly numerically .",
    "it is worth noticing that most of the equations of state that are of astrophysical interest behave like polytropes for low and for high pressures , i.e. , they belong to the class of asymptotically polytropic equations of state .",
    "however , a unified analytical treatment of this important class , comparable to that of the polytropes , does not exist so far in the literature , and thus there is a gap that needs to be closed .",
    "in this paper we consider static spherically symmetric newtonian perfect fluid models with barotropic equations of state that are asymptotically polytropic for low and high pressures .",
    "this is done by introducing new variables so that a regular set of three autonomous ordinary differential equations with bounded dependent variables is obtained .",
    "two of the variables are asymptotically homology invariant",
    ". moreover , the variables are chosen so that the equation of state is encoded in a single function appearing at only one place in the equation system . for polytropes",
    "this function reduces to the polytropic index @xmath5 .",
    "thus the formulation not only naturally incorporates our knowledge about polytropes but also allows us to deduce features valid for the general class of asymptotically polytropic equations of state .",
    "the main goals of the paper are to provide :    * a framework yielding a visual representation of the solution space , which allows us to obtain qualitative information about solutions , * a framework suitable for numerical investigations , * a formulation that makes a host of mathematical tools from dynamical systems theory available , i.e. , a framework that makes it possible to prove theorems about e.g. , the relationship between the equation of state and mass- and radius - properties .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in section  [ equationsofstate ] we define and discuss the family of asymptotically polytropic equations of state . in section  [ dynamicalsystemsformulation ]",
    "we introduce new bounded variables , and derive the 3-dimensional system of autonomous equations . in section  [ dynamicalsystemsanalysis ]",
    "we discuss the state space associated with our formulation and do a local dynamical systems analysis that yields asymptotic expressions for e.g. , the mass and gravitational potential for the various solutions .",
    "in addition we give a theorem describing the global dynamics of the state space . this theorem ( and most of the following theorems )",
    "is proved later in appendix  [ a ] , to make the paper more accessible to the general reader . in section  [ examples ]",
    "we give a number of examples that illustrate the usefulness and pedagogical value of our approach .",
    "for instance , it is shown that the problem corresponding to chandrasekhar s equation of state for white dwarfs has a particularly simple and elegant description .",
    "we also give a variety of mass - radius diagrams showing how extremely complicated mass - radius diagrams can become ( at least for unstable models ) .",
    "in section  [ qualitativeresults ] we state a number of theorems .",
    "firstly , we give criteria for the equation of state that ensure that the corresponding models have finite radii and masses .",
    "secondly , we state theorems about how mass - radius relationships depend on the equation of state .",
    "most of the proofs are given in appendix  [ a ] .",
    "in section  [ concludingremarks ] we conclude with a discussion about possible generalizations .",
    "appendix  [ a ] contains a brief introduction to some relevant background material from dynamical systems theory , and most of the proofs of the theorems .",
    "finally , in appendix  [ b ] we discuss some miscellaneous results .",
    "consider a perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state @xmath6 . define @xmath7    [ etaass ] we assume that @xmath2 is defined for @xmath8 and positive for @xmath9 and also that @xmath10 exists when @xmath11 .    for static perfect fluids the quantity @xmath10 is directly related to the newtonian potential @xmath12 . integrating the fluid equation @xmath13 ( euler s equation ) we obtain @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the so - called surface potential .",
    "from the above assumption it follows that @xmath10 is a monotone function of @xmath1 and @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be viewed as functions of @xmath10 and the equation of state is implicitly given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",

( and @xmath32 ) may be less than @xmath33 . hence , the class of asymptotically polytropic equations of state comprises the occasionally considered `` essentially polytropic '' or `` quasi - polytropic '' equations of state @xcite .",
    "] we also assume that @xmath24 is @xmath34 on @xmath35 and bounded on @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the above assumption implies that we restrict our attention to _ asymptotically polytropic _ equations of state , i.e. , we consider equations of state that for low pressures ( i.e. , for @xmath37 ) take the form @xmath38 , and that for high pressures ( i.e. , for @xmath39 ) take the form @xmath40 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is possible to soften the above assumptions , but then it is preferable to incorporate such generalizations into the formalism itself .",
    "this leads to more cumbersome formulations than the one introduced below , and , to show the value of our type of approach , we want to keep things relatively simple in this paper .",
    "note that linear equations of state @xmath45 yield `` @xmath46 '' because @xmath10 does not exist .",
    "equations of state that are asymptotically linear are therefore examples that need slightly different treatment than those presently considered . in appendix  [ b ]",

    "it follows that @xmath54 .",
    "( the above description is adapted to the low pressure limit , however , if one is so inclined , one can equally well adapt to the high pressure limit , and introduce an associated constant @xmath55 ) .",

    "note that @xmath56 for the polytropes and that @xmath24 can be interpreted as a local polytropic index .",
    "note also that monotonicity of @xmath20 is equivalent to non - negativity of @xmath24 . even though it is not necessary , we will for simplicity assume a non - negative @xmath24 throughout the paper , apart from appendix  [ b ] .",
    "in newtonian gravity the spherically symmetric equilibrium of a self - gravitating perfect fluid is governed by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mass inside @xmath59 ; the gravitational constant has been set to @xmath33 . equation  ( [ mpeq ] ) is to be understood in connection with an equation of state @xmath20 .",
    "we will focus on asymptotically polytropic equations of state .",
    "note incidentally that static stellar models are necessarily spherically symmetric , see @xcite for an overview .",
    "existence and uniqueness of solutions of  ( [ mpeq ] ) has been proved for rather general equations of state comprising the equations of state considered in the present context , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the above equations  ( [ mpeq ] ) are singular when @xmath60 , which causes some problems , but even worse is that @xmath20 is not @xmath34 at @xmath61 for asymptotically polytropic equations of state . in this section",
    ", we will introduce new bounded dimensionless variables that lead to a completely regular autonomous system of equations .",
    "we will do this in two steps since the intermediate step is useful in itself .    to obtain an autonomous system we `` elevate '' @xmath59 to an dependent variable and introduce @xmath62 , defined by @xmath63 , as a new independent variable .",
    "we also make a variable transformation from @xmath64 to the following three variables , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is some positive constant ( the choice depending on the equation of state , see discussion below ) .",

    "the equation for @xmath76 decouples and leaves a 2-dimensional coupled system for @xmath75 and @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath77 is a solution of  ( [ mpeq ] ) , then so is @xmath78 .",
    "however , the latter is associated with an equation of state that differs by a factor of @xmath79 from that of the first one , i.e. , it is associated with @xmath80 . in the @xmath81 formulation",
    ", this feature corresponds to translatory invariance of solutions , i.e. , the second solution is given by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , since @xmath63 .",
    "accordingly the system  ( [ uqomeq ] ) describes an equivalence class of proportional equations of state @xmath84 , parametrized by @xmath22 .",
    "it is even possible to incorporate an additional degree of freedom into the dynamical system  ( [ uqomeq ] ) by choosing the @xmath76-variable in a more general way , so that the system describes a two - parameter class of equations of state .",
    "however , to simplify matters , we are going to take the viewpoint that we always consider a given equation of state @xmath17 ( i.e. , we fix @xmath22 ) , and thus that an orbit @xmath85 is associated with a single perfect fluid solution @xmath86 of  ( [ mpeq ] ) .",
    "we now proceed by defining new bounded variables . by our assumptions",
    "it follows that @xmath76 is positive and that @xmath87 are either both positive as well or both negative depending on whether @xmath88 is positive or negative .",
    "we now consider the positive mass case , while the negative mass case is treated briefly in appendix  [ b ] .",
    "the new bounded variables @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) are defined by :    @xmath91    introducing a new independent variable @xmath92 according to @xmath93 yields the following equations :    [ uqomega ] @xmath94 \\\\ \\label{qeq }    \\frac{dq}{d\\lambda } & =     q(1-q)[(2u-1)(1-q ) + q(1-u ) ] \\\\",

    "we now include the boundaries in our analysis so that our state space consists of the unit cube : @xmath97 ^ 3 $ ] .    to be able to discuss this dynamical system ( e.g. , to do a fixed point analysis ) it is required that @xmath95 is @xmath34-differentiable on @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing the parameter @xmath66 sufficiently small . by assumption  [ n0n1exists ] , @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "therefore , making the choice @xmath102 , we obtain @xmath103 ( provided that the @xmath104-terms are well - behaved ) .",
    "we are thus mimicking the features of an exact polytrope asymptotically as far as possible .",
    "let us now consider composite equations of state where @xmath0 is piecewise @xmath34 on @xmath35 .",
    "in such situations @xmath105 are continuous , but @xmath106 is not and neither is @xmath95 .",
    "it follows from the definitions that @xmath10 , @xmath73 and hence @xmath107 , @xmath108 are continuous .",
    "the mass density @xmath2 is continuous if @xmath0 is @xmath109 on @xmath35 , otherwise @xmath2 makes one or several jumps ( a situation that corresponds to phase transitions ) .",
    "the variables @xmath75 and @xmath110 are continuous if @xmath2 is , but if @xmath2 jumps from some value @xmath111 to @xmath112 , then @xmath75 and @xmath110 make a jump according to @xmath113 , which follows directly from the definitions of @xmath75 and @xmath110 .",
    "solutions described by piecewise @xmath34 equations of state on @xmath35 can be obtained by viewing the above transformation as a map between state spaces associated with smoothly extended equations of state .",
    "note that , in general , if one starts out with a regular solution , then this solution has to be matched with a non - regular one associated with the other ( extended ) equation of state .",
    "in addition to the dynamical system it is of interest to consider the following _ auxiliary equations _ :    [ uqomegaaux ] @xmath114",
    "an important feature of the dynamical system  ( [ uqomega ] ) is that all orbits are strictly monotonically decreasing in @xmath107 except if @xmath115 , @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "this fact will be of key importance when we prove the following theorem in appendix a :    [ fix ] all solutions converge to fixed points when @xmath118 except when @xmath119 @xmath120 is equal to 5 . in this latter case solutions also converge to a 1-parameter set of closed orbits @xmath121 @xmath122 when @xmath123 .",
    "thus the fixed points and the periodic orbits @xmath124 describe the asymptotic features of the solutions .",
