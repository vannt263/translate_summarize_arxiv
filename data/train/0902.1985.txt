    "[ igr112p3:fig : period_lcv ] shows the  light curve folded on a period of 164.6  days , to properly compare the properties of the three observed outburst .",
    "based on the first recognized periodicity of 329  days ( paper  i ) we have designated these three outbursts as `` periastron '' ( 2007 february ) and `` apastron '' outbursts ( 2007 july and the one reported here ) .    in paper  iii we proposed an alternative explanation for the sfxts outbursts , based on the properties of the observed  x  ray light curve",
    ". its shape could not be modelled by bondi - hoyle accretion from a homogeneous and spherically symmetric wind from the blue supergiant companion .",
    "we suggested the presence , besides the symmetric polar wind , of an equatorially enhanced wind component ( denser and slower than the polar one ) , possibly clumpy ( to explain the high variability of the source flux ) and inclined with respect to the orbital plane , to account for the narrow and steep x ",
    "ray light curve in outburst and the periodic outbursts .",
    "the presence of equatorially enhanced winds in blue supergiants has also been suggested in literature from the variability of optical spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , from simulations @xcite , and from x  ray observations of a number of supergiant high mass x ",
    "ray binaries displaying apastron flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in paper  iii we also discussed two possible orbital geometries for , and obviously different wind parameters for both the equatorial and the polar components , to explain the x ",
    "ray luminosity observed : ( 1 ) an orbital period , @xmath63 , of 329  days ( and a circular orbit , with two observed outbursts per orbit ) or ( 2 ) an orbital period , @xmath64 , of @xmath5165  days , with only one outburst per orbit and a higher eccentricity , together with a possibly truncated equatorial wind ( this to avoid observing an outburst at @xmath35 , which is now excluded based on the observation performed in 2008 march , see fig .",
    "[ igr112p3:fig : historical_lcv ] ) .",
    "the new 2008 outburst , compared in fig .  [ igr112p3:fig : period_lcv ] with the one observed in 2007 february and 2007 july , displays a similar duration and x  ray luminosity , although the sampling of the three monitoring campaigns is very different .",
    "thus we will not discuss further the wind parameters ( density and velocity needed to explain the x  ray emission ) , due to the analogies of the three outburst light curves , and we will refer to paper  iii , where we report a possible choice for the wind parameters that match the observed x - ray light curve , as the model is essentially open and different combinations of wind density and velocity in the equatorial wind can reproduce the x - ray light curve . on the other hand , in 2008 the source seems to remain longer in a sort of bright state after the peak ( see fig .",
    "[ igr112p3:fig : period_lcv ] ) : observations performed 56 days after the bright peak , found the source still at a high x ",
    "ray level ( @xmath50.3countss@xmath9 ) , with a count rate about one order of magnitude higher than the average level of the 2007 february declining tail .",
    "it is important to note , however , that is a highly variable source , displaying a frequent flaring activity with a large dynamic range even during the tail of the 2007 february outburst ( this is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ igr112p3:fig : period_lcv ] ) .",
    "thus we can not exclude that during the last outburst in 2008 ,  observations caught by chance only the bright peaks of a similar flaring activity , while the tail , much fainter on average , was not observed , due to the several gaps and sparse sampling .",
    "a second possibility is the variability of the wind properties which could produce a longer outburst at periastron or the presence of single dense clumps , which are not uncommon in blue supergiants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and could have been accreted and thus produced these bright peaks . a third",
    "yet more unlikely possibility is that this quite high count rate observed about 56 days after the bright peak on 2008 june 16 , could be part of a much longer x  ray outburst peak , lasting 56 days ( but note that there is a large observing gap between the two sets of observations ) , due to accretion of matter from the equatorial wind near the apastron passage , where the neutron star velocity could be 56 times lower than during the periastron passage ( assuming the same size for the compressed wind outflow ) in an eccentric binary .",
    "this latter hypothesis can be actually excluded by the following argument : a supposed range of variability for the neutron star orbital velocity of 56 times can be obtained only in an orbit with a high eccentricity , @xmath650.7 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath66 would imply a very high dynamic range of @xmath67 ( assuming wind parameters discussed in paper  iii ) between the x  ray luminosity produced at the periastron passage and that produced at apastron , when the neutron star crosses the equatorial wind ; but this large difference in the peak amplitude ( which is similar during all outbursts ) is excluded by the observations .",
    "the new observations reported here trace quite well the rise to the new outburst , and if compared with previous observations , allow to possibly say something more conclusive about the true orbital period of this binary system .",
    "indeed we favor an eccentric orbit with an orbital period of @xmath5165  days , with one outburst per orbit produced near the periastron passage .",
    "this conclusion can be derived from the arguments we discuss below .",
    "the three outburst peaks observed with /xrt can be very well overlaid , when they are folded on a period of 164.6  days ( see fig .  [",
    "igr112p3:fig : period_lcv ] ) .",
    "this interestingly implies that they are very closely time - locked .    in the framework of our proposed model ( where outbursts are produced when the neutron star crosses the supergiant equatorial wind , which is inclined with respect to the orbital plane ) , this close time - locking implies that , if the true orbital period is 329  days , the orbit should be perfectly circular ( to have two outbursts per orbit at exactly a half of the orbital period ) .",
    "moreover , the supergiant compressed outflow in the magnetic equator should be highly stable and `` rigid '' up to large distances from the companion : for a binary period of @xmath16  days , the orbital separation is @xmath54@xmath6810@xmath69  cm ( about 25 stellar radii for a typical b1 supergiant ) .",
    "detailed studies and simulations of equatorially enhanced supergiant winds suggest that a rotating supergiant with a dipole magnetic field aligned to the star s rotation axis , can produce a steady magnetically confined line - driven stellar wind on the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "for example , the wind of a b1-type supergiant can be perturbed to form an equatorial density enhancement with a relatively low magnetic field of about 2030 g . indeed , assuming the `` wind magnetic confinement parameter '' @xmath70 @xcite , the minimal magnetic field , b@xmath71(for @xmath70=1 ) , for an equatorial wind compression is b@xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the wind mass loss rate , @xmath74 the terminal velocity and r@xmath75 the supergiant radius .",

    "it extends to 20 stellar radii only in case of highly magnetic bp stars @xcite .",
    "thus , such a large compressed equatorial wind structure seems to be less likely for a b supergiant .",
    "this would favor a less wide and eccentric orbit for  with an orbital period of @xmath5165 days .",
    "this also avoids the intersection of the equatorial wind component near apastron passage .",
    "another piece of evidence favoring the 165 days orbital period comes from the fact that there is no evidence for a changing absorption column density between the three different outbursts observed with . if the outbursts are produced by sudden accretion of denser material due to the neutron star ingress into the supergiant equatorial wind , a different absorbing column density should in principle be observed between two consecutive outbursts ( one at the periastron and the other one at the apastron , if we assume @xmath16  days ) .",
    "since the supergiant equatorial component is inclined with respect to the neutron star orbit , the observer should see one of the two outbursts in front of it , and the other one from behind it ( thus with a higher column of absorbing matter towards the line of sight ) .",
    "but a difference in the column density is not observed , within the uncertainties .",
    "this difficulty could be avoided in the @xmath16 days scenario only if we assume that the system is viewed face - on , and with a supergiant equatorial wind component perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "moreover , it seems quite unlikely that the supernova explosion which produced the neutron star has completely misaligned the orbital plane with the supergiant spin axis , but did not produce at the same time an eccentric orbit , thus leaving behind a perfectly circular orbit ( as required if the true period is 329  days ) .    in conclusion , all these arguments based on the new /xrt observations indicate that an orbital period of 329  days would imply a too much fine - tuned geometry of the system , and on the other hand suggest that  is very likely in an eccentric orbit with an orbital period of 164.6  days , where the outbursts are produced near the periastron passage by the same wind structure crossed every time .",
    "the rise to the outburst is much better sampled in 2008 than during the february 2007 outburst , thus allowing us to confirm once more that the shape of the light curve can not be explained by accretion from a spherical distribution of matter ( homogeneous or not ) as already demonstrated in paper  iii . in particular",
    ", the new light curve clearly shows a rise to the outburst of @xmath52 orders of magnitude in the source count rate in less than about @xmath102 orbital phase ( assuming @xmath103  days period ) . on the contrary ,",
    "a wind with a spherical distribution ( and the same stellar parameters as in paper  iii ) can at most produce this difference in count rate during @xmath104 orbital phase , assuming the highest possible orbital eccentricity of e=0.89 ( or the neutron star orbit would lie inside the supergiant at periastron ) .",
    "@xcite proposed different possible geometries for sfxts , within the framework of a clumpy spherical wind from the supergiant companion . in their model , a periodic recurrence of the outbursts could be explained only with an eccentric orbit . on the other hand , even assuming a very high eccentricity of the orbit , as discussed above , any spherically symmetric distribution of matter ( although clumpy ) can not reproduce both the steep rise to the outburst and the entire narrow shape of the outburst in  ( paper  iii ) .",
    "our interpretation of the outbursts of  with a preferential plane for the wind outflow can benefit from much better constrained wind parameters ( density , velocity , mass loss rate ) , and its application to all the other sfxts needs to be tested and confirmed .",
    "indeed , we are currently monitoring 4 sfxts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) with frequent observations spread over a long - baseline in order to assess whether it is possible to extend or reject this model for all the other members of the same class .",

    "<S> we test our proposed model which explains the outbursts from sfxts as being due to the passage of the neutron star inside the equatorially enhanced wind from the supergiant companion . </S>",
    "<S> we performed a guest investigator observation with   that lasted 20ks and several follow - up target of opportunity ( too ) observations , for a total of @xmath4ks , during the expected `` apastron '' passage ( defined assuming an orbital period of @xmath5330 days ) , between 2008 june 16 and july 4 . </S>",

    "<S> the properties of the rise to this new outburst and the comparison with the previous outbursts allow us to suggest that the true orbital period of  is very likely 164.6  days , and that the orbit is eccentric , with the different outbursts produced at the periastron passage , when the neutron star crosses the inclined equatorial wind from the supergiant companion . </S>",
    "<S> based on a too observation performed on 2008 march 2527 , we can exclude that the period is 165/2 days . </S>"
