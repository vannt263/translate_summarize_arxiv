    "dressler & gunn ( 1983 ; 1992 ) found galaxies with mysterious spectra while investigating high redshift cluster galaxies .",
    "the galaxies had strong balmer absorption lines with no emission in [ oii ] .",
    "these galaxies are called `` e+a '' galaxies since their spectra looked like a superposition of that of elliptical galaxies ( mg@xmath5 , fe@xmath6 and ca@xmath7 absorption lines ) and that of a - type stars ( strong balmer absorption lines ) .",
    "the existence of strong balmer absorption lines shows that these galaxies have experienced starburst recently ( within a gyr ; goto 2004b ) .",
    "however , these galaxies do not show any sign of on - going star formation as non - detection in the [ oii ] emission line indicates .",
    "therefore , e+a galaxies are interpreted as a post - starburst galaxy , that is , a galaxy which truncated starburst suddenly ( dressler & gunn 1983 , 1992 ; couch & sharples 1987 ; maclaren , ellis , & couch 1988 ; newberry boroson & kirshner 1990 ; fabricant , mcclintock , & bautz 1991 ; abraham et al . 1996 ) . the reason why they started starburst , and why they abruptly stopped",
    "starburst remains one of the mysteries in galaxy evolution .",
    "one possible explanation for the e+a phenomena is a dust enshrouded starburst galaxy . in this scenario ,",
    "e+a galaxies are not post - starburst galaxies , but in reality star - forming galaxies whose emission lines are invisible in optical wavelengths due to the heavy obscuration by dust ( smail et al .",
    "1999 ; poggianti & wu 2000 ) .",
    "a straightforward test for these scenarios is to observe in radio wavelengths where the dust obscuration is negligible .",
    "miller & owen ( 2001 ) observed radio continua of 15 e+a galaxies and detected moderate levels of star formation in only 2 of them .",
    "goto ( 2004b ) performed 20 cm radio continuum observation of 36 e+a galaxies using the vla , and found that none of their e+a galaxies are detected in 20 cm , suggesting that e+a galaxies are not dusty - starburst galaxies .",
    "alternative explanations to e+as include cluster related physical mechanisms .",
    "since e+a galaxies were found in cluster regions at first , both in low redshift clusters ( caldwell et al . 1993 , 1996 ; caldwell & rose 1997 ; castander et al .",

    "2003,2004 ) , a cluster specific phenomenon was thought to be responsible for the violent star formation history of e+a galaxies .",
    "for example , a ram - pressure stripping model ( spitzer & baade 1951 , gunn & gott 1972 , farouki & shapiro 1980 ; kent 1981 ; abadi , moore & bower 1999 ; fujita & nagashima 1999 ; quilis , moore & bower 2000 ; fujita 2004 ; fujita & goto 2004 ) may first accelerate star formation of cluster galaxies and later turn it off as well as tides from the cluster potential ( e.g. , fujita 1998 ) and the evaporation of the cold gas ( e.g. , fujita 2004 ) .",
    "another possible origin is the galaxy - galaxy interaction , which has been known to trigger star formation in a pair of galaxies ( schweizer 1982 ; lavery & henry 1988 ; liu & kennicutt 1995a , b ; schweizer 1996 ) .",
    "bekki , shioya , & couch ( 2001 ) modeled galaxy - galaxy mergers with dust extinction , confirming that such systems can produce spectra which evolve into e+a spectra .",
    "although these scenarios are all plausible , the definitive conclusion has not been drawn yet , mainly because e+a galaxies are a vary rare class of galaxies and have been difficult to study in a large number .",
    "the largest sample of e+a galaxies to date is presented by galaz ( 2000 ) , which , however , is a heterogeneous sample of only 50 e+as .",
    "below , we overcome this problem by selecting e+a galaxies from the @xmath3250,000 spectra of the sloan digital sky survey data release 2 ( sdss ; abazajian et al .",

    "we have created a new sample of e+a galaxies using the publicly available sdss dr2 ( abazajian et al .",

    "these two criteria can almost entirely eliminate contamination from mis - classified stars and hii regions in nearby galaxies .",
    "we further restrict our sample to those with spectroscopic signal - to - noise @xmath1310 per pixel ( in continuum of the @xmath14band wavelength range ) since it is difficult to measure absorption lines when signal - to - noise is smaller than 10 .",
    "for these galaxies , we have measured h@xmath15 , [ oii ] and h@xmath0 equivalent widths ( ews ) and obtained their errors using the flux summing method similar to the one described in goto et al .",

    "the only difference from goto et al .",

    "we also exclude galaxies at @xmath17 from our sample since the overlapping sky feature at 5577  disturbs the h@xmath15 ew measurement .",

    "( 2003a ) , such selections of e+a galaxies without information on h@xmath0 line would suffer from 52% of contamination from h@xmath0 emitting galaxies , whose morphology and color are very different from that of e+a galaxies ( goto et al . 2003b",

    "blake et al .",

    "therefore , we do not consider evolution within the e+a sample in this paper .",
    "in order to test if e+a galaxies are created by the cluster related mechanisms or not , we first investigate environment of e+a galaxies in mpc scale .",
    "if the origin of e+a galaxies is physical mechanisms related to galaxy clusters or large scale structures , e+a galaxies should show excess in abundance in such environments .",

    "on the other hand , the density distribution of e+a galaxies and the field galaxies are indistinguishable at all scales .",
    "these results indicate that e+a galaxies are not likely to be created by physical processes at work at cluster scale ( 0.5 , 1.5 mpc ) , nor by the large scale structure ( 8 mpc ) .",
    "we discuss the relevance to the previous work and more physical implications in section [ discussion ] .",

    "the fore / background counts are statistically subtracted . ]",
    "next , we investigate the environment of e+a galaxies in much smaller physical scale of 50 - 200 kpc . in the previous subsection , we used the volume limited sample of spectroscopic galaxies to investigate mpc scale environment .",
    "however , this method can not be used to probe kpc scale environment since ( i ) the sdss fiber spectrograph can not be located closer than 55 arcsec . and",
    "thus , significant fraction of galaxies within 55 arcsec from the central e+a galaxies are missing from the sdss spectroscopic sample ; ( ii ) the spectroscopic sample has a bright flux limit ( @xmath23 ) , and thus , can not probe the over - density of faint galaxies at a small scale .",
    "we overcome these problems by utilizing the sdss imaging data , which provide relatively good star / galaxy separation as faint as @xmath24 mag ( scranton et al .",
    "2002 ) . at several radii between 50 and 200 kpc ,",
    "we count number of galaxies in the imaging data between @xmath25 and @xmath26 after applying k - correction .",
    "this k - correction was applied on galaxy - by - galaxy basis assuming the redshift of the central e+a galaxy using the code provided by blanton et al .",
    "( 2003 ; v3_2 ) . this magnitude range allows us to use all 266 e+a galaxies including the furtherest one at @xmath27 .",
    "the number count of background galaxies computed from randomly selected 10 deg@xmath28 are adjusted to the sky area of the radii and subtracted using the same magnitude range .",
    "this background subtraction is relatively small ( only @xmath33% in 50kpc and 30% in 200 kpc ) due to the small angular area probed , justifying our use of the imaging data to investigate kpc scales . and , since the background is computed using a much larger part of the sky ( thus more stable ) , we regarded errors associated with this background subtraction negligible compared with the poisson errors associated with the sample itself . for a comparison , we perform the same analysis to randomly selected @xmath29 galaxies in a similar redshift and signal - to - noise ratio range .",
    "figure [ fig : kpc_raw ] shows the resulting average number of companion galaxies within 50 - 200 kpc radii around e+as ( solid line ) and the comparison sample ( dashed line ; we call this as field galaxies hereafter ) .",
    "to clarify the difference , we plot the number ratio of e+a companions and field companions in fig . [ fig : kpc_ratio ] . in both figures ,",
    "error bars are based on poisson statistics , and mainly dominated by the small number statistics of e+a galaxies .",
    "it can be seen that e+a galaxies has excess number of companion galaxies at a small scale of 50 - 100 kpc , with the difference increasing with decreasing radius .",
    "although error bars on e+a sample is not so small as the field sample , the difference at 50kpc is at @xmath30 significance with e+as having 35% more companion galaxies than field galaxies .",
    "this may suggest that the origin of e+a galaxies is associated with the excess number of companion galaxies , possibly linking to frequent merger / interaction with companions .",
    "we further discuss this in section [ discussion ] .",
    "it is also worth noting that at 175 - 200kpc , e+a galaxies have smaller number of companion galaxies than the field galaxies .",
    "if true , this may reflect depletion of companion galaxies at this scale due to the central e+a s cannibalism of companion galaxies . in the top panel of fig.[fig:0.5 - 8mpc ] , we see a possible skew of the e+a s local galaxy density distribution toward lower density in 0.5 mpc scale",
    ". this may be consistent with the results with 175 - 200kpc , suggesting e+a galaxies may have under - density at 175 - 500kpc scale .",
    "both of the results are consistent with the hypothesis that e+a galaxies do not exist in cluster environment .",
    "note that the cosmic variance is not worrisome here since both the e+a and the field samples are drawn from the large sky area covered by the sdss ( @xmath133000 deg@xmath28 ) .",
    "also note that since we have used the same background subtraction for both the e+a and the field samples , the difference between these two must stem from the difference between these two samples , not from the background subtraction .              in the previous sections ,",
    "we have investigated kpc to mpc environment of e+a galaxies , and found that e+a galaxies have excess number of companion galaxies at @xmath4100 kpc scale , but not in any larger scale ( figs .",

    "in addition , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ea7_images ] , there are notable number of e+a galaxies with disturbed / tidal tail signatures : for example , the lowest redshift one , sdssj161330.24 + 510335.6 , has an apparent head - to - head interaction with a companion ; sdssj084918.96 + 462252.6 , sdssj125820.64 + 613039.6 , sdssj120418.96 - 001855.8 , and sdssj111441.52 + 593029.8 have low surface brightness but obvious tidal features ; sdssj122156.4 + 000948.2 has an apparent companion with tidal tails ; sdssj105435.51 + 555738.1 is apparently a satellite galaxy of a grand nearby spiral . beside this one",
    ", we also found a few other cases where e+as are a satellite of a giant galaxy .",
    "these findings of apparent companion / tidally disturbed features are consistent with our findings of the excess number of companion galaxies at @xmath4100 kpc scale , together indicating that dynamical interaction with close companion galaxies may be the origin of e+a galaxies .",
    "in section [ sec : results ] , we showed that the distribution of e+a galaxies is significantly different from that of cluster galaxies in 0.5 - 8 mpc scales , and that e+a galaxies are ubiquitous in the field region .",

    "<S> e+a galaxies are characterized as a galaxy with strong balmer absorption lines but without any [ oii ] nor h@xmath0 emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of strong balmer absorption lines indicates that e+a galaxies have experienced starburst within recent one gyr . </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> the lack of [ oii ] and h@xmath0 emission lines indicates that e+a galaxies do not have any on - going star formation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , e+a galaxies are interpreted as a post - starburst galaxy . for many years , however , it has been a mystery why e+a galaxies started starburst and why they quenched the star formation abruptly . </S>",
    "<S> using one of the largest samples of 266 e+a galaxies carefully selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release 2 , we have investigated the environment of e+a galaxies from 50 kpc to 8 mpc scale , i.e. , from a typical distance to satellite galaxies to the scale of large scale structures . </S>",
    "<S> we found that e+a galaxies have excess of local galaxy density only at a scale of @xmath1 kpc ( with a two @xmath2 significance ) , but not at the cluster scale ( @xmath31.5 mpc ) nor in the scale of large scale structure ( @xmath38 mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that e+a galaxies are not created by the physical mechanisms associated with galaxy clusters or the large scale structure , but are likely to be created by the dynamical interaction with closely accompanying galaxies at a @xmath4100 kpc scale . </S>",
    "<S> the claim is also supported by the morphology of e+a galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that almost all e+a galaxies have a bright compact core , and that @xmath330% of e+a galaxies have dynamically disturbed signatures or the tidal tails , being quite suggestive of morphological appearance of merger / interaction remnants . </S>"
