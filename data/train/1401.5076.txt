    "in local galaxies , optical / uv nebular lines are among the most used diagnostics of the physical properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , these diagnostics are not accessible at high-@xmath6 , as they are shifted in the mid - infrared regime , where sensitive spectroscopy is out of reach for present instrumentation .",
    "the only optical / uv emission line detected at @xmath7 is hydrogen s ly-@xmath1 , which is hard to interpret in terms of ism physics , due to its resonant nature ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    in this context ,",
    "fine  structure transitions represent key tools to investigate the ism properties at high-@xmath6 . with rest - frame wavelengths in the 50500@xmath2 m range , at @xmath8",
    "these lines are redshifted into the ( sub-)mm transparent windows of the atmosphere .",
    "the most studied fine ",
    "structure line is the ionized carbon ( ) line at 158@xmath2 m , which is now ( almost ) routinely detected in ir ",
    "bright sources at high redshift @xcite .",
    "neutral carbon ( ) has been reported in about 20 sources at high-@xmath6 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "over the last two years , other fine structure lines have been detected for the first time in high-@xmath6 galaxies : neutral oxygen ( at 63 and 146@xmath2 m , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , doubly - ionized oxygen ( at 52 and 88@xmath2 m , see * ? ? ? * ) , and ionized nitrogen ( at 122 and 205@xmath2 m ; see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations of a combination of these lines provide key diagnostics regarding the physical properties of the atomic and ionized phases of the ism in galaxies ( e.g. , the hardness of the uv radiation field , gas temperature and density , mass , metallicity ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ionized nitrogen is of particular interest as its ionization potential ( 14.53 ev ) is slightly above that of hydrogen , so emission traces the ionized medium , with the ratio between the two forbidden - line transitions of , at 122 and 205 @xmath2 m , being a direct probe of gas density ( in the regime between 10 and 3000@xmath9 ) .",
    "the 205 @xmath2 m transition has critical density and potential of second ionization that are very close to those of ( @xmath10 @xmath9 and @xmath11ev , respectively , if electrons are the main collision partners , as in regions ) .",
    "their flux ratio is thus a diagnostic of the relative abundance of c@xmath12 and n@xmath12 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , independently of the hardness of the ionization field .",
    "because the ionization potential of carbon is slightly below the one of hydrogen , the emission can arise both from regions and from the neutral outskirts of dense molecular clouds .",
    "therefore , for a given metallicity , the to flux ratio can be used to probe the fraction of carbon emission arising from the ionized medium ( where both c@xmath12 and n@xmath12 are present ) vs.   that arising from the neutral phase ( where n@xmath12 is suppressed ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this letter",
    ", we present first observations in br1202 - 0725 , a system of interacting galaxies at @xmath13 .",
    "this system is of particular interest because it encompasses a qso ( south  east ) , a sub - mm galaxy ( smg , north ",
    "west ) , and two ly-@xmath1 emitters ( laes , one located between the qso and the smg , the other located south - west of the qso ) , all accommodated within @xmath14 on sky ( @xmath15 kpc at @xmath13 ) .",
    "[ fig_ima ] shows the _ hubble space telescope_/advanced camera for survey @xmath16-band image of the field .",
    "given the diversity of galaxy types in such a small region of the sky , br1202 - 0725 represents a unique laboratory of star formation and galaxy assembly only @xmath17 gyr after the big bang .",
    "the qso and the smg are among the brightest , unlensed sources in terms of dust luminosity ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the optical / nir images of the qso are completely dominated by the nuclear light , which overwhelms the host galaxy starlight ( see fig .  [ fig_ima ] ) .",
    "the smg is barely detected at optical / nir wavelengths , due to heavy dust obscuration .",
    "all the companion galaxies are clearly detected in sensitive _ hst _ and ground  based broad ",
    "band observations of the rest  frame uv / optical stellar continuum .",
    "the laes are also clearly detected in dedicated narrow ",
    "band observations encompassing the ly-@xmath1 line @xcite and in spectroscopic observations of this system @xcite .",
    "thanks to its enormous ir luminosity , br1202 - 0725 has been long studied at ( sub-)mm wavelengths .",
    "multiple co transitions ( 1 - 0 , 2 - 1 , 4 - 3 , 5 - 4 , 7 - 6 ) have been detected @xcite , together with neutral and ionized carbon fine structure lines @xcite . @xcite and @xcite presented atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) observations of the emission in br1202 - 0725 . the emission is clearly detected in the qso and the smg .",
    "interestingly , they also reported continuum and tentative line detections associated with lae2 , although only part of the line width fell into the alma bandpass .",

    "the observed to ratio is consistent with unity , thus suggesting that these lines are associated with a purely ionized medium . on the other hand ,",
    "the to ratio in the smg and , most of all , in the qso , is much higher ( see table [ tab_lines ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_hii_pdr ] we plot the to ratio as a function of ir luminosity for the various components of br1202 - 0725 , and for the few galaxies at @xmath44 for which both has been detected , and deep 205 @xmath2 m observations have been reported in the literature @xcite .",

    "moreover , their to ratio is substantially lower than typically observed in ir ",
    "bright smgs and qsos at high@xmath6 , and is consistent with the range of values expected for region conditions ( shaded green area ) . on the other side , the majority of the ir ",
    "bright sources studied so far have high to ratios .",
    "this suggests that there is additional emission that may be arising from the _ neutral _ medium in the outskirts of dense molecular regions ( pdr  like ) or from extended xdrs , where is not present ( red shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig_hii_pdr ] ) .",
    "in particular , in the qso , the observed ratio is @xmath48 times higher than what predicted in the most conservative region scenario , thus suggesting that @xmath49% of the in this source is emitted in the ionized phase of the ism . the global ratio observed in the smg",
    "is lower , @xmath50 , still too high for regions .",
    "however , the different profiles of the and lines in this source suggest that the picture is more complex , and that we are probably witnessing a composite source in which both regions and dense molecular clouds play important roles . deeper data at higher spatial resolution and significantly higher",
    "signal - to - noise with alma will allow us to perform a velocity- and spatially  resolved study of the to ratio , thus disentangling the role of each component .",
    "we have presented first 205@xmath2 m observations in br1202 - 0725 , an ir  bright system of interacting galaxies at @xmath51 .",
    "the system consists of a qso , an smg , and two laes .",
    "we report detections in the smg and in the lae2 . we combine the observations of the with previously published observations .",
    "the to luminosity ratios span over one order of magnitude , being @xmath52 in the laes , and @xmath53 in the smg and in the qso .",

    "the laes are well within the parameter space of regions . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission associated with the neutral phase is high in the smg and , most of all , in the qso .",
    "this is the first time that the relative importance of the ionized vs neutral phases of the ism can be directly compared in high-@xmath6 galaxies .",
    "deeper observations of this system , in particular using the atacama large millimeter array , are crucial in order to confirm the tentative detections reported here . in addition , observations of other fine - structure lines ( e.g. , and ) will allow us to expand our analysis to different regimes ( e.g. , the highly  ionized medium ) and to put first constraints on other parameters ( e.g. , metallicity ) in this unique laboratory of star formation in the early universe .",
