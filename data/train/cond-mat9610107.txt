    "the basic procedure in the renormalization group ( rg ) is to keep relevant information of a physical system , and neglect ( or integrate out ) irrelevant one .",
    "@xcite the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) introduced by white  @xcite greatly enhances the applicability of the numerical rg , because the method automatically keeps a fixed numbers ( @xmath10 ) of the relevant basis ; dmrg present the best approximation within the limited numerical resource that we can use .",
    "the dmrg has been applied to a number of one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum lattice systems , such as the spin chain ,  @xcite ladder ,  @xcite bethe lattice system ,  @xcite strongly correlated electron systems ,  @xcite models in momentum space .",
    "@xcite not only the numerical superiority , but also the formulation of dmrg have attracted theoretical interests .",
    "stlund and rommer  @xcite have shown that dmrg is a variational method , where the ground state is expressed as a product of 3-index tensors .",
    "@xcite martn - delgado and sierra have investigated the analytic formulation of dmrg , and have formulated the correlated block rg .",
    "@xcite recently white have refined the finite system algorithm of dmrg , and extend the applicability of dmrg to 2d quantum systems .",
    "@xcite quite recently xiang have reported dmrg study of 1d quantum system at finite temperature ,  @xcite using the quantum transfer matrix formulation  @xcite and dmrg applied to the transfer matrix .",
    "@xcite    another rg approach has been development for 2d classical lattice models : baxter s method of the corner transfer matrix .",
    "( ctm )  @xcite the method is a generalization of kramers - wannier approximation ,  @xcite and therefore baxter s method is based on a variational principle for the partition function .",
    "it should be noted that baxter s variational relation is in principle the same as the variational relation in dmrg .",
    "@xcite the purpose of this report is to explain how the concept of dmrg is applied to 2d classical lattice models .",
    "we start from a short review of the variational relation in dmrg in the next section .",
    "it is worth looking at a practical use of the rg method as the 2d photo image compression .",
    "@xcite a photo image in our computer is normally compressed before it is stored , in order to decrease the file size . the compression algorithm is related to the block rg method ,  @xcite since a small region  a pixel  in a 2d picture has strong correlation with its environment .",
    "( computer scientists may insist that their findings about the photo image compression are efficient for rg formulation in physics . ) at present , compression of movies  tv pictures  are in progress in the world of computation ;  @xcite the algorithm may be a good reference for the rg study of 3d classical systems and 2d quantum systems .",
    "the development of rg , dmrg , baxter s ctm method , and the photo image compression is summarized in fig.1 .",
    "originally these methods are proposed independently , however , now it is apparent that their background is in common .",
    "it is , to approximate a system ( or the _ objects _ ) within a limited number of freedom .",
    "we start from a short review of the variational principle in dmrg .",
    "we consider the antiferromagnetic @xmath11 heisenberg spin chain as an example of 1d quantum systems .",
    "the spin hamiltonian is @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the quantum spin at @xmath14-site , and the parameter @xmath15 is positive .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath16 is real - symmetric , and so is the density matrix @xmath17 .",
    "( in the following discussion , @xmath1 does not always have to be real - symmetric , but should be positive definite . )",
    "we consider an open spin chain , ( fig.2 ) which consists of the left half [ @xmath18 ( @xmath19 the local system ) and the right half [ @xmath20 ( @xmath19 the reserver ) .",
    "the terms ` local system ' and ` reserver ' are rather formal , since [ @xmath20 is not always longer than [ @xmath18 .",
    "( in fig.2 both [ @xmath18 and [ @xmath20 has the same size . ) the hilbert space of the whole system is spanned by the real - space basis @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 corresponds to the spin configuration for [ @xmath18 and [ @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath1 is given by @xmath24 in the context of dmrg , what is called the _",
    "density matrix _",
    "is actually the density submatrix ( dsm ) latexmath:[\\[\\rho^l = \\sum_{l l ' } | \\ , l \\ ,",
    "\\rangle \\ , \\rho^l_{l l ' } \\ , \\langle \\ , l ' \\ , | \\ , \\equiv \\ , \\sum_{l l ' }     that contains the information only about the local system [ @xmath18 .",
    "the trace of @xmath26 is equal to the partition function .",
    "the relevant state selection  renormalization  in dmrg is performed through the diagonalization of the dsm @xmath27 where @xmath28 are eigenvalues in decreasing order , @xmath29 are the set of the corresponding right eigenvectors , @xmath30 are that of the left eigenvectors . the matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfies the dual orthogonal relation @xmath33 . when @xmath26 is real - symmetric , @xmath32 is equal to @xmath31 , and both of them are orthogonal matrices .",
    "the first @xmath34 column vectors @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) in @xmath32 represent the rg transformation from the original basis @xmath37 to the renormalized basis @xmath38 .",

    "@xcite    we can check the validity of the above basis state selection by observing the inequality @xmath39 the quantity @xmath40 is the approximate partition function , which is smaller than @xmath41 by @xmath42 .",
    "it has been known that if the system has a finite excitation gap , the eigenvalue @xmath43 decays exponentially with respect to @xmath14 , and therefore @xmath44 is a good approximation for @xmath41 when @xmath34 is sufficiently large .",
    "the approximate partition function is equal to the trace of the @xmath34-dimensional diagonal matrix @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the rectangular matrix @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is @xmath49 .",
    "we can regard the matrix operation of @xmath50 and @xmath46 to @xmath26 as the rg transformation ( or the block spin transformation ) , and @xmath51 as the renormalized dsm .    substituting eq.(6 ) into eq.(5 ) , we obtain a variational relation in the matrix form @xmath52 where the matrix product @xmath53 has the property of the projection operator @xmath54 .",
    "the projection operator @xmath55 is _ optimal _ in the sense that it gives maximum of @xmath56 under the constraint @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in other word , the dmrg minimize the free energy of the system within the restricted degree of freedom .",
    "at the zero temperature ( @xmath59 ) , dmrg minimize the total energy .    the optimal projection operator @xmath2 for the local system [ @xmath18 is dependent on the size of the reserver [ @xmath20 .",
    "however , the dependence is not conspicuous when [ @xmath20 is sufficiently large .",
    "the infinite system dmrg algorithm uses the insensitivity of @xmath2 against the reserver size .",
    "the finite system dmrg algorithm is more accurate than the infinite algorithm , because the former correctly takes into account of the reserver - size dependence .",
    "in order to apply the variational relation in dmrg to 2d classical lattice system , we define the dsm for 2d systems .",
    "we use the fact that the density matrix @xmath60 of a @xmath61-dimensional quantum system can be expressed as a partition function of a @xmath61+@xmath8-dimensional classical system with special boundary conditions ; the relation is known as the trotter - suzuki formula .  @xcite    the density matrix of the heisenberg chain in fig.2 is approximated as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the partition of @xmath16 .",

    "the expression of @xmath26 in fig.4(b ) is a typical example of the dsm for 2d classical lattice models .",

    "figure 8(a ) shows an example when @xmath99 .",
    "we occasionally drop the vector indices of @xmath100 and write it simply as @xmath101 ; in that case we think of @xmath101 as a @xmath102-dimensional matrix @xmath103 .",
