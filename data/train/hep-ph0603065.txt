    "event shapes provide a rich ground for testing the perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics of qcd .",
    "as they are in general less inclusive than total cross - sections , event shapes receive larger nonperturbative contributions to their observed values , but are still sufficiently inclusive to allow for a controlled expansion in these power corrections .",
    "thus we may hope both to observe these effects easily in experiment and also to describe them theoretically .",
    "arguments based on analysis of renormalon ambiguities and resummed perturbation theory have led to well - known universality relations amongst the leading nonperturbative power corrections to traditional event shapes such as thrust and @xmath0-parameter ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "similar analyses have shown the power corrections to recently - introduced angularity variables @xcite also to obey a very simple universal scaling rule @xcite .",
    "these arguments , however , rely on the approximation of single gluon emission dominating the nonperturbative effects .",
    "effective field theory provides another framework to investigate the effects of perturbative and nonperturbative physics in hadronic observables in an organized way . by separating the physics occurring at disparate time or energy scales in a systematic expansion in a small parameter determined by the ratio of these scales , effective field theories",
    "can facilitate the proofs of factorization theorems and make manifest any relations between the nonperturbative functions or parameters contributing to different physical observables .    the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )",
    "was introduced at first to study the energetic and light hadronic products in heavy meson decays in endpoint regions of phase space , for example , in @xmath1 or @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "recently , the same formalism was also applied to the case of jet production in @xmath3-annihilation or @xmath4 decays .",
    "@xcite proved a factorization theorem for jet energy distributions , which was extended to other event shapes in ref .",
    "these works reproduced in the effective theory language the factorization theorems already derived in the perturbative qcd analyses of korchemsky and sterman using the eikonal approximation @xcite . in these approaches ,",
    "information about the nonperturbative dynamics is contained in shape functions of wilson lines of soft gluons . by comparing the shape functions arising for the different event shape distributions , we can learn to what extent the nonperturbative effects in the various observables are really related to each other .    in this presentation",
    ", we derive shape functions for thrust , jet mass , @xmath0-parameter , and angularity distributions and explore how to reproduce the relations that exist between the power corrections to these event shapes in the approach introduced by dokshitzer and webber @xcite .",
    "the relation between thrust and the jet mass sum becomes immediately apparent , while the others can be reproduced if we also make the single gluon approximation . in the companion contribution @xcite in these proceedings",
    ", we observe that the shape functions derived here already contain enough information to reproduce the same relations for these variables even without invoking the single gluon approximation .",
    "some common event shapes used to describe the final state @xmath5 in @xmath3 annihilation are the thrust : @xmath6 the jet mass sum : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the total invariant masses of the particles in the two hemispheres @xmath10 determined by the thrust axis , and the @xmath0-parameter : @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the eigenvalues of the @xmath13 matrix : @xmath14 the @xmath0-parameter can also be expressed as : @xmath15 in addition , the angularities are defined as : @xmath16 which are infrared - safe variables for @xmath17 ( although we will consider only @xmath18 ) , and where @xmath19 measures the angle between @xmath20 and the thrust axis @xmath21 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "this reduces to @xmath23 .",
    "the two - jet limit corresponds to @xmath24 .    for these and other event shapes @xmath25 ,",
    "it has been argued that nonperturbative effects simply shift the argument of perturbatively - calculated distributions , that is , @xmath26 or just the mean values , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a universal quantity whose size is of order @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is an observable - dependent coefficient . for @xmath31 , @xmath0 , and @xmath32 , @xmath33",
    "the quantity @xmath28 depends on the strong coupling constant @xmath34 and an `` effective '' coupling @xmath35 at an infrared scale @xmath36 .",
    "the universality of @xmath28 can be tested by fitting the couplings @xmath37 and @xmath38 to data for different event shapes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to separate perturbative and nonperturbative contributions to event shape distributions , we must show that the theoretical expressions for these distributions factorize .",
    "we use the formalism of scet to accomplish this .",
    "the differential cross section in the variable @xmath25 in @xmath39 annihilation to jets is given in qcd by the expression : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the leptonic part of the scattering amplitude , and the current generating the final hadronic state is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the dirac structure coupling to photons or @xmath4 bosons .",
    "we suppress an implicit sum over flavors and colors .",
    "scet is an effective theory of qcd containing collinear and ultrasoft quarks and gluons @xcite . ] .",
    "these degrees of freedom may be characterized by the typical size of the components of their momenta in light - cone coordinates . in terms of light - cone directions",
    "@xmath44 ( for instance , @xmath45 ) , these components are @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "collinear fields in the @xmath49 direction represent those particles with momenta scaling as : @xmath50 while ultrasoft particles have momenta scaling as : @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is a small parameter determined by the different energy scales appearing in the physical process at hand . in the case of @xmath39 annihilation to jets , @xmath53 , so that collinear particles have typical virtualities of order @xmath54 , while ultrasoft particles have virtualities @xmath55 . the effective theory",
    "is then formulated order - by - order by expanding the qcd lagrangian in powers of @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite    at leading order in @xmath52 , the qcd current @xmath56 matches onto a current in scet @xcite : @xmath57\\gamma^\\mu_\\perp c(\\mathcal{\\bar p},\\mathcal{\\bar p^\\dag},\\mu)[w_{\\bar n}^\\dag \\xi_{\\bar n}],\\ ] ] where @xmath58 are collinear fields in the back - to - back light - cone directions @xmath44 , @xmath59 are wilson lines of collinear gluon fields @xmath60 : @xmath61,\\ ] ] which are required to ensure collinear gauge invariance @xcite , @xmath62 is the wilson coefficient , and @xmath63 are label operators picking out the large label momenta of the collinear fields @xcite . at tree level in matching , @xmath64 .",
    "factorization is much more easily proven after the field redefinition @xcite : @xmath65 using the wilson line of ultrasoft gluons @xmath66 : @xmath67.\\ ] ] this field redefinition removes all couplings between collinear partons and ultrasoft gluons in the leading - order scet lagrangian .",
    "for instance , the only coupling between collinear quarks and ultrasoft gluons in this lagrangian is : @xmath68 where the ultrasoft covariant derivative @xmath69 turns into an ordinary derivative upon the field redefinition in eq .",
    "( [ bps ] ) .",
    "this eliminates interactions between the collinear and ultrasoft sectors of scet at leading order in @xmath52 .",

    "the collinear part of the formula gives the leading - order total cross - section @xmath77 in perturbation theory , leaving a nonperturbative shape function : @xmath78{\\left\\lvert 0\\right\\rangle}\\right\\rvert}^2\\delta ( e - e(x_u ) ) \\equiv s_e(e),\\ ] ] where we have used that for an event shape @xmath25 which approaches zero in the two - jet limit , the collinear partons do not contribute to @xmath25 at linear order in an expansion in @xmath79 .",
    "from now on , we will keep the dependence of the event shapes on the ultrasoft momenta only to linear order in @xmath79 . by studying this shape function for different choices of @xmath25",
    ", we may hope to uncover some useful relations between the nonperturbative effects in different event shapes .",
    "the nonperturbative shape functions for different event shapes are distinguished solely by the final delta function appearing in eq .",
    "( [ shapefunction ] ) . for the angularities ,",
    "this delta function becomes @xmath80 where @xmath10 are the hemispheres ( determined by the thrust axis ) containing the quark or antiquark , respectively , and sums are over particles @xmath81 in the state @xmath73 . for the @xmath0-parameter ,",
    "the delta function is @xmath82 for the jet mass sum , we have @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the total momentum of the ultrasoft particles in hemisphere @xmath10 . from this formula and eq .",
    "( [ angularitydelta ] ) for @xmath85 , it follows that the first moment of the thrust ( @xmath86 ) and jet mass sum shape functions are identical , reproducing the result in eq .",
    "( [ cfactors ] ) that @xmath87 . however , it is not immediately apparent from these results how the shape functions given by eq .",

    "@xcite ) , which sets the scale for the couplings @xmath90 .",
    "we may imagine integrating the distributions @xmath91 over a region of @xmath25 of size @xmath92 , near the two - jet endpoint @xmath93 , taking the size of @xmath92 to be @xmath94 .",
    "alternatively , we may take moments of the distributions , which are dominated by events in the region of size @xmath92 near the endpoint .",
    "we may then taylor expand the delta functions : @xmath95 where in the first line , we take @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) if the gluon is in the hemisphere with the quark ( antiquark ) .",
    "the first terms of these expansions give the leading - order perturbative result for the shape functions , while the second term gives rise to the leading nonperturbative correction . inserting these expansions back into eq .",
    "( [ shape1gluon ] ) , evaluating the amplitude to create one gluon , and evaluating the integral , we find the relation between the leading nonperturbative shift to the first moments of the angularity and @xmath0-parameter distributions : @xmath98 which are consistent with the values for the factors @xmath30 given in eq .",

    "we have recast the factorization of event shape distributions in the language of soft - collinear effective theory .",
    "the decoupling of collinear and ultrasoft modes at leading - order in the scet expansion allows for a simple proof of this factorization .",
