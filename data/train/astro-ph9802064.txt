    "although the study of galaxies at high redshift neither begins nor ends with the hubble deep field ( hdf ) , this conference has demonstrated the ways in which the hdf has served to focus the attention of the community on the properties of galaxies at @xmath0 . in part",
    "this is because the hdf imaging data was obtained through several filters , permitting the use of color selection techniques to isolate and study populations of galaxies at various redshifts .",
    "because the hdf images are so deep , colors can be measured with unusually high precision ( and in a spatially resolved fashion _ within _ individual galaxies ) for objects which ordinarily would be considered very faint for ground  based telescopes .",
    "additionally , the hdf images easily detect galaxies at magnitudes well beyond the spectroscopic limits of even the largest telescopes . the desire to understand their nature requires _",
    "some _ idea of their distances , and it is therefore tempting to look for photometric means of estimating redshifts without the benefit of ordinary spectroscopy .    for these reasons , many presentations at this symposium have considered various applications of `` photometric redshift '' estimation in the hdf and in other data sets .",
    "one such method takes advantage of the ubiquitous 912  lyman limit discontinuity , which is redshifted into the hdf bandpasses at @xmath4 . in recent years ,",
    "color selection based on the lyman limit has developed into a highly successful means of detecting galaxies at large redshifts , as i will review below . in designing the hdf observations , our working group at stsci incorporated f300w imaging into the four  filter scheme for two reasons , one scientific and one purely practical .",
    "first , such data offers the potential for lyman break selection of high redshift galaxies .",
    "second , we wished to take advantage of the `` bright '' portions of the orbit during continuous view zone visibility , when scattered earthlight severely impacts wfpc2 imaging at redder wavelengths .",
    "the reduced amplitude of the scattered background at uv wavelengths , and the fact that f300w imaging with wfpc2 is not normally background limited anyway , made bright  time observing through that bandpass a suitable use for these otherwise disadvantageous observing intervals .",
    "i begin with a descriptive review of the lyman break technique , illustrated using data from the hdf .",
    "although the hdf lyman break galaxy sample is much smaller than that which has been identified from ground  based imaging studies ( which cover much larger solid angles ) , the excellent photometric precision of the hdf data and the large percentage of lyman break galaxies present at the fainter magnitude limits which it probes makes it quite useful for illustrating the principles of the method . in ",
    "2.1 i summarize the current status of spectroscopy on hdf lyman break galaxies . in  3",
    "i discuss some of the statistical properties of lyman break galaxies , concentrating on their numbers , luminosities , and colors , and inferences that can be derived from these measurements . finally ,  4 discusses the rest  frame optical properties of @xmath0 galaxies in the hdf using deep infrared imaging data . in his contribution to this volume",
    ", mauro giavalisco discusses our ground  based lyman break galaxy sample in greater detail , and addresses the spectroscopic , morphological , and clustering properties of lyman break galaxies , which i will largely neglect here .    in this paper ,",
    "hdf galaxy selection and object names are based on the catalog of williams et al .  (",
    "optical photometry is reported on the ab magnitude system , with the wfpc2 bandpasses indicated by 300 , 450 , 606 and 814 .",
    "in general i have used new , revised photometry of the williams et al .",
    "catalog objects based on optimized apertures which maximize signal  to  noise for color measurement .",
    "this has the advantage of allowing robust lyman break galaxy selection to somewhat fainter magnitudes than was previously possible .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the principle of the lyman break color selection technique using a galaxy from the hdf as an example . in the absence of dust extinction , an actively star  forming galaxy",
    "should have a blue continuum at rest ",
    "frame ultraviolet wavelengths , nearly flat in @xmath5 units .",
    "blueward of the 912  lyman limit , however , photoelectric absorption by intervening sources of neutral hydrogen will sharply truncate the spectrum .",
    "this hydrogen may be located in the photospheres of the uv  emitting stars themselves , in the interstellar medium of the distant galaxy , or along the intergalactic sightline between us and the object . when observed at some large redshift , the rest ",
    "frame lyman limit of a galaxy shifts between some pair of bandpasses ( e.g. the wfpc2 300 and 450 filters in figure 1 ) , and the galaxy `` drops out '' when viewed through the bluer filter because of the suppression of its flux .",
    "in addition to the lyman continuum absorption , the cumulative effect of the lyman  @xmath6 forest lines introduces an additional spectral break shortward of lyman  @xmath6 at the emission redshift of the galaxy .",
    "this flux suppression is increasingly strong at higher redshifts as the forest thickens , and introduces its own color effects , particularly for galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "color selection based on the effects of the lyman limit and lyman  @xmath6 forest has been used for many years in surveys for distant qsos ( e.g. warren et al .",
    "the method was applied to the study of distant galaxies by guhathakurta et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and songaila , cowie & lilly ( 1990 ) , who used it set limits on the number of star  forming galaxies at @xmath2 in faint galaxy samples .",
    "steidel & hamilton ( 1992 ) and steidel , hamilton & pettini ( 1995 ) reported the detection of significant numbers of high redshift galaxy candidates using this method .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts was first presented by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , and wfpc2 images of select examples were published by giavalisco et al .",
    "( 1996b ) .",
    "to date , the majority of lyman break selected galaxies come from the @xmath8 survey of steidel et al . ,",
    "which has identified more than a thousand candidates and has spectroscopically confirmed ( as of this writing ) more than 400 galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "this survey is discussed in greater detail by giavalisco in this volume , and in the present paper i will often refer to it as the `` ground  based sample '' to distinguish it from hdf  selected objects .",
    "although lyman break galaxies in the hdf are fewer in number than those in the ground  based sample , the quality and depth of the hdf imaging data offer a number of advantages .",
    "the hdf can be used to detect lyman break galaxies at fainter apparent magnitudes than has been achieved in ground  based data , and the precision of the 450 , 606 and 814 photometry ensures small random errors on color measurements .",
    "moreover , the depth and resolution of the wfpc2 imaging permits detailed morphological study of these objects .",
    "the primary _ disadvantage _ of the hdf is its small field of view , and hence the rather small comoving volume which it samples .",
    "this limits its utility for statistical studies ( e.g. of luminosity functions , redshift distributions , etc . ) , as small number statistics , galaxy clustering , and field  to  field variations may introduce significant uncertainties .",
    "my own favorite `` view '' of the hubble deep field is that shown in figure 2 , a color  color diagram of galaxies in the hdf .",
    "one of the most prominent features of this diagram is the dramatic `` plume '' of galaxies rising nearly vertically from the zero color point ( i.e. flat spectrum galaxies ) up toward very red @xmath9 colors .",
    "these are the high redshift , star forming galaxies  objects whose 912  lyman discontinuities are entering into and passing through the f300w bandpass , shifting them into a portion of color  color space which is unpopulated by low redshift objects .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the redshift dependent effect of the lyman limit and lyman  @xmath6 spectral `` breaks '' on the colors of galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts @xmath0 . to first order , the galaxies in the high redshift `` plume '' form a redshift sequence ordered by @xmath9 color . in practise ,",
    "variation in individual galaxy spectra shuffle this sequence somewhat .",
    "dynamic range for the 300 photometry also affects this ordering , as it is only possible to set limits on the @xmath9 colors of fainter objects , and the numerical values of these limits therefore depend on the apparent magnitude of the galaxies .",
    "the lower panel of figure 3 shows the increasing effect of the lyman  @xmath6 forest ( and , at @xmath10 , of the lyman limit ) on the 450 - 606 color .",
    "this effect was used by lowenthal et al .",
    "( 1997 ) as an additional criterion for identifying high redshift galaxy candidates ( cf . also fruchter , this volume ) .",
    "using color selection criteria such as those of steidel et al.(1996a , b ; see also below ) , the application of a color cut such as @xmath11 results in an upper redshift bound @xmath12 .",
    "it is this reddening of @xmath13 which is responsible for the `` tilt '' of the plume in the @xmath14 color  color diagram shown in figure 2  the higher redshift 300 dropout galaxies `` fan out '' toward redder 450 - 606 colors .",
    "figure  4 shows a different 2color diagram of hdf galaxies , this time using 606 - 814 colors which are relatively unaffected by ly@xmath6 absorption at @xmath15 . here , the `` plume '' remains more or less vertical .",
    "the lyman break color technique is a simple form of photometric redshift selection . here",
    "we do not attempt to accurately estimate the redshifts of individual objects , but simply to use color criteria to select galaxies in a particular redshift interval and exclude foreground ( and background ) objects .",
    "the redshift selection function of the method depends on the particular color criteria adopted , on the intrinsic dispersion in the ultraviolet spectral properties of star forming , high redshift galaxies , on cosmic variance in the intergalactic transmission along different lines of sight , and on the distribution of photometric measurement errors .",
    "this redshift selection function can be estimated using spectral models along with realistic simulations of photometric errors , or can be measured directly by obtaining enough spectroscopic redshifts to define it empirically .",
    "we now know that the lyman break galaxy population exhibits strong clustering in redshift space ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 ; cf .",
    "also giavalisco , this volume , and figure 7 below ) . therefore in order to determine the redshift selection function empirically one must study many independent sightlines in order to average over the effects of large scale structure .",
    "we have done this for our ground  based survey , and thus feel that we understand the redshift selection function quite well . for the hdf , we have only the one `` realization '' of the redshift distribution , and thus the empirical selection function can not properly be determined  here we must rely to some degree on models , although these models can be informed by the information on galaxy spectral properties which has been gained from the ground  based samples .",
    "the f300w filter in wfpc2 is substantially bluer than @xmath16 bandpasses used at terrestrial observatories .",
    "as such , 300 photometry is sensitive to the passage of the lyman break at significantly lower redshifts than is the case for , e.g. , the @xmath8 system used by steidel et al .",
    "for example , roughly 90% of galaxies in our ground  based @xmath8 survey lie in the redshift range @xmath17 .",
    "by @xmath18 , however , the lyman limit is already well into the wfpc2 f300w bandpass and produces a recognizably large color signature .",
    "followup spectroscopy has already identified 300dropout galaxies down to @xmath19 , and others which did not successfully yield redshifts quite likely lie at redshifts slightly below 2 , where the absence of strong spectral features in the wavelength range presently accessible to lris at keck makes secure redshift measurement difficult .",
    "the commissioning of a new blue channel on lris will soon make it possible to measure redshifts for many more 300 dropouts in the hdf .",
    "the sensitivity of the 300 filter to lyman break galaxies at lower redshifts has benefits and disadvantages .",
    "it opens a larger volume of redshift space to lyman break selection , thus increasing the number of objects which may be identified this way . at the same time , as already noted , it makes many of them more difficult to confirm with optical spectra .",
    "however , the ease of selecting galaxies at @xmath20 has one spectroscopic advantage : this is the range of `` magic redshifts '' for near  infrared spectroscopy , where the [ oii ] , [ oiii ] , h@xmath21 and h@xmath6 lines are all accessible in the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands .",
    "this may make the hdf lyman break galaxies particularly useful for studying nebular emission line diagnostics ; already elston et al .",
    "have observed h@xmath6 from several hdf lyman break galaxies at @xmath25 ( see below ) .",
    "various groups have created photometrically defined samples of high redshift galaxy candidates in the hdf .",
    "the color selection criteria differ , and no `` definitive '' method has yet been established .",
    "the number of lyman break candidates therefore varies from sample to sample depending on the criteria which are adopted .",
    "for example , madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) defined conservative selection criteria based on models of galaxy color distributions in order to select @xmath0 galaxies while avoiding significant risk of contamination from objects at lower redshift .",
    "these criteria , however , miss some of the galaxies which are now spectroscopically confirmed to have @xmath0 . using the wealth of redshift information now available in the hdf",
    "we can revisit this question and refine the selection criteria . as it happens , applying the same criteria used by steidel et al .  for selecting lyman break galaxies in the ground ",
    "based @xmath8 color system does an excellent job of isolating @xmath0 galaxies in the hdf .",
    "specifically , we may use the so  called `` marginal '' criteria of steidel et al .",
    ", namely @xmath26 this successfully recovers all 24 spectroscopically confirmed lyman break galaxies in the hdf at @xmath27 .",
    "as is the case for the ground  based sample , the only substantial contaminants are galactic stars , some of which also satisfy these criteria , but these are easily recognized in the wfpc2 images and excluded .",
    "( all obvious stars with these colors have also already been observed spectroscopically , as it turns out . ) the only known low ",
    "redshift galaxy which satisfies these criteria is , of all things , the brightest galaxy in the hdf : an elliptical in wf2 at @xmath28 .",
    "this is not surprising , as ellipticals have colors similar to those of k  stars , and are thus `` interlopers '' for the same reason until their redshifts become large enough ( @xmath29 ) for @xmath30correction effects to move them out of the color selection region .",
    "there should be very few @xmath31 early  type galaxies in the small volume of the hdf which populate this part of color  color space .",
    ", should successfully exclude most interlopers at @xmath31 . ]    excluding stars and the few obvious @xmath31 interlopers , there are approximately 187 galaxies in the hdf with @xmath32 which satisfy these color criteria and thus probably fall in the redshift range @xmath33 .",
    "the exact number depends somewhat on the choice of what constitutes a single galaxy with multiple clumps versus separate objects with small angular separations .",
    "e.g. should the `` quad galaxy , '' 4858.0 at @xmath34 , be considered a single galaxy with four pieces or four separate objects ?",
    "such distinctions may be merely semantic or may be very important depending on the question being asked ( cf .",
    "colley et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ) .      to date , 26 galaxies in the hdf have spectroscopic redshifts @xmath0 .",
    "23 of these were pre  selected as lyman break objects for spectroscopic observation .",
    "one galaxy , 4 - 445.0 , was observed by cohen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as part of a magnitude limited spectroscopic sample , but qualifies photometrically as a lyman break galaxy nevertheless .",
    "one other was was observed serendipitously ( 2 - 585.1  see below ) , but also satisfies the lyman break color criteria defined above .",
    "finally , one galaxy ( 3 - 577.0 ) was observed as a gravitational lens candidate ; it is too faint for a robust 300 lyman break measurement and so does not qualify ( see below ) .",
    "table 1 lists these objects , including several galaxies from our own observations which are previously unpublished .",
    "there are many more lyman break candidates , primarily @xmath36 dropouts , which have spectroscopically accessible magnitudes , and with considerable effort this list could eventually more than double in length .",
    "few of the @xmath37 dropout objects ( @xmath38 candidates ) are bright enough to tempt the spectroscopist , but if they have strong emission lines a few may still yield redshifts .    0.1 in    lcclcl & ra & dec & & @xmath39 & reference + 2 - 449.0 & 12:36:48.332 & 62:14:16.67 & 2.008 & 23.68 & s + 2 - 585.1 & 12:36:49.808 & 62:14:15.18 & 2.008 : & 23.85 & e + 3 - 118.1 & 12:36:54.724 & 62:13:14.74 & 2.232 & 24.41 & * + 2 - 903.0 & 12:36:55.071 & 62:13:47.05 & 2.233 & 24.60 &",

    "( 1998 ) report on a strong redshift `` spike '' seen in another survey field , while giavalisco et al .",
    "( 1998 ; see also this volume ) have measured the angular correlation function of lyman break galaxies .",
    "figure 7 , as well as data we have collected in other fields , shows that these highly overdense redshift ",
    "space structures are ubiquitous at @xmath2  the case studied in steidel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is not unique , and we find similar spikes in essentially all of our survey fields once sufficiently large numbers of redshifts have been collected .",
    "the hdf is no exception .",
    "what fraction of the faint galaxy population lies at these large redshifts ?",
    "this was the question addressed by guhathakurta et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , who were among the first to apply the lyman break technique to faint galaxy samples . at the magnitude limits of their sample they found few @xmath16band dropout objects and concluded that only a small fraction of faint galaxies lie at @xmath2 .",
    "however this fraction rises as we go fainter ; the exact proportion depends on the color selection ( different criteria probe different volumes at high redshift ) and the photometric depth of the sample . in figure 8",
    "i show the overall number counts of galaxies in our ground  based survey and in the hdf , compared to the number of lyman break candidates in each .",
    "brighter than @xmath64 , all of the color ",
    "selected objects in the ground  based sample have turned out to be galactic stars ( plus a small number of high redshift qsos )  we have yet to find a lyman break galaxy with @xmath65 in the 0.24 square degrees which we have surveyed .",
    "fainter than this , the number of lyman break objects rises rapidly , reaching 5% of the galaxy population at @xmath66 . in the hdf",
    "the counts of lyman break galaxies are higher .",
    "this is partially due to the larger volume probed by the color selection technique in the hdf because of the bluer f300w filter",
    ". it may also reflect genuine redshift evolution in the galaxy population , however , since the hdf 300dropout galaxies have lower mean redshifts than do the objects in the ground  based sample , and the total uv luminosity density in galaxies is evidently rising from @xmath53 to 2 ( madau et al .  1996 ) . at @xmath67 , nearly 1 in 4 galaxies in the hdf is probably at @xmath4 .    with a robust technique for identifying large numbers of galaxies in a particular redshift range we may quantify various statistical properties of the population even without complete spectroscopic redshift information . here",
    "i will consider luminosity and color distributions of lyman break galaxies .",
    "another example is the angular correlation function , which is addressed in the contribution of giavalisco to this volume .      the redshift selection function of our ground  based @xmath8 survey is now well categorized , with more than 400 spectroscopic redshifts measured in many independent survey fields . for a particular color  defined subset of our sample",
    "we find that approximately 90% of the galaxies lie at @xmath17 .",
    "the front  to  back `` depth '' of this redshift range is small , photometrically speaking ( i.e. in terms of distance modulus ) , and thus the counts of lyman break galaxies , even without confirming redshifts , primarily reflect their intrinsic luminosity distribution .",
    "the physical significance of the `` luminosity function '' of lyman break galaxies is different from that of the more familiar optical luminosity functions that have been determined locally and out to @xmath68 from the cfrs , autofib , cnoc and hawaii surveys . by observing @xmath2 galaxies through optical bandpasses we are measuring their luminosities at rest  frame ultraviolet wavelengths of approximately 1500 . for young galaxies ,",
    "ultraviolet continuum emission arises mainly from hot , massive stars , modulated by the absorbing effects of dust . in the absence of extinction ,",
    "the ultraviolet luminosity thus primarily reflects an _ instantaneous _ property of a galaxy : its star formation rate .",
    "the uv luminosity declines rapidly after the cessation of star formation as the o and b stars which produce it burn off the main sequence . in more local galaxy samples , the rest ",
    "frame optical light used to define luminosity functions manifests some integral over the past star formation history of a galaxy , and thus better describes its total stellar content .",
    "it is therefore most straightforward to interpret the uv luminosity function ( uvlf ) of lyman break galaxies as a distribution of star formation rates in the population .",
    "the complication , however , is that the effects of extinction on uv emission can potentially be large , and are at present mostly unknown for @xmath2 galaxies .",
    "i return to this issue below , considering only the `` raw '' luminosities here .",
    "figure 9 presents a composite luminosity distribution for lyman break galaxies derived from the ground  based and hdf samples .",
    "here i briefly describe the procedures used in constructing this diagram in order to point out some of the inherent uncertainties .",
    "a detailed discussion and analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( dickinson et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the overall luminosity distribution has been normalized using data from our ground  based sample .",
    "here the statistics are good thanks to the large number of lyman break objects and the use of many survey fields to average over local fluctuations , and the redshift selection function is well characterized through extensive spectroscopy . at brighter magnitudes ( @xmath69 )",
    "there is significant contamination from galactic stars ( plus a few qsos ) . at those magnitudes , therefore , only spectroscopically confirmed galaxies have been used . from @xmath70 ,",
    "the number counts from figure 9 are used with a small , modeled correction for incompleteness .",
    "spectroscopy has confirmed that the stellar and qso contamination is very small at these magnitudes .",
    "the measured redshift selection function of the ground  based sample is used to normalize the survey volume .",
    "the true normalization is probably higher , as i have assumed that the color criteria are 100% efficient at the peak of the selection function ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "comparison of our ground  based lyman break sample in the hdf and the wfpc2 images demonstrates that we do miss some fraction of candidates , even at relatively bright magnitudes , due to photometric confusion with foreground galaxies .",
    "for example , 4555.1 , a galaxy at @xmath72 which is one of the brightest lyman break objects in the hdf ( and which is illustrated in figure  1 above ) is missed in the ground  based sample due to flux contamination by a foreground elliptical galaxy only @xmath73 away .",
    "the ground  based data , reaching @xmath74 , probes only the relatively bright end of the lyman break galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the hdf offers an opportunity to sample lower luminosities .",
    "the difficulty with the hdf sample , however , is that its redshift selection function is quite uncertain ; only 24 @xmath75dropouts have measured redshifts .",
    "moreover , the spectroscopic success rate is probably declining rapidly at @xmath76 due to the lack of strong spectral features in the wavelength range currently accessible to lris .",
    "finally , there is only one hdf and it covers a _ very _ small region of the sky . as noted above , we now know that lyman break galaxies are strongly clustered , and thus any single , narrow pencil beam survey will encounter a highly non  random galaxy distribution .",
    "this complicates the determination of the redshift selection function , and may compromise any attempt to normalize the luminosity function simply because field  to  field variations can not be averaged away .",
    "the southern hdf , planned for 1998 , will offer a second `` realization '' of the f300w dropout sample for comparison , but still the total volume surveyed will be small .",
    "in addition , as noted above , the redshift range of the hdf lyman break galaxies is much broader than that of the ground  based sample , and extends to lower redshifts .",
    "hdf 300dropouts with measured redshifts have @xmath77 , but it is likely that the mean redshift of the complete photometrically selected sample is lower still .",
    "madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggest that the uv luminosity density of the universe , an integral over the luminosity function , was rising steeply with time at this cosmic epoch , a result derived from the hdf data by comparing numbers of 300 and 450dropout objects .",
    "therefore the luminosity function itself may have evolved rapidly at these redshifts , providing an additional uncertainty for splicing the ground  based and hdf lyman break samples together .",
    "also , this broader redshift range means that the photometric `` depth '' of the survey ( in terms of relative distance modulus , front to back ) is larger .",
    "this complicates the transformation from apparent magnitude distribution to luminosity function , both by blurring the distance modulus conversion and by making k ",
    "correction effects somewhat larger .    for the present purposes ,",
    "i have used the hdf sample mainly to provide an indication of the uvlf slope at faint luminosities .",
    "magnitudes of hdf galaxies are transformed to luminosities assuming @xmath78 .",
    "initially we normalize the survey volume by assuming unit selection efficiency over the range @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting hdf luminosity function is still higher than the ground  based counts over the range of luminosity overlap . in part this may be due to incompleteness in the ground  based sample , but it is likely that it also manifests to the effect of redshift evolution . here , the hdf space densities have been scaled downward to match that of the ground  based sample in the luminosity range of overlap .",
    "the faintest data points in figure 9 should be regarded with caution , as the sample may suffer as  yet unquantified incompleteness effects at its photometric limits .",
    "thus while the luminosity function appears to be flattening , the apparent slope should be taken as a limit to the true value .",
    "one measure of the distribution of galaxy star formation rates in the local universe is the h@xmath6 luminosity function of gallego et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in figure 9 , both the @xmath2 uvlf and the h@xmath6 measurements at @xmath79 have been converted to star formation rates ( sfr ) using consistent assumptions of a salpeter imf spanning 0.1125 @xmath80 ( e.g. madau et al .",
    "1998 ; adopting the kennicutt 1983 conversion for h@xmath6 , which assumes a somewhat different imf , increases the gallego et al .",
    "sfr values by 26% ) .",
    "the sfr distribution at @xmath81 is strikingly like that measured at @xmath82 , spanning a similar range but with more galaxies per unit volume forming stars at any given rate .",
    "the characteristic `` @xmath83 '' of the @xmath81 and @xmath82 sfr distributions are approximately 14 and 10 @xmath80  yr@xmath84 , respectively , and the faint end slopes are similar .",
    "these similarities may very well be coincidental .",
    "no correction has been made for the effects of extinction in the @xmath81 galaxies ( the gallego et al .",
    "h@xmath6 data does include an extinction correction ) . as we will see below",
    ", these corrections could be quite significant .",
    "also , the lyman break luminosity function in figure 9 is plotted for an einstein  de sitter cosmology . for an open universe",
    "the @xmath2 data translates downward and to the left relative to the local data , i.e. toward higher luminosities / sfrs but lower space densities .",
    "thus both extinction and cosmology could work in the direction of increasing the typical star formation rates inferred for high redshift galaxies .",
    "the physical state of star formation in the distant galaxies may be quite different than that in the `` typical '' galaxy actively forming stars in the nearby universe .",
    "the sizes of lyman break galaxies are much smaller than those of ordinary galaxies with similar star formation rates nearby ( giavalisco et al .",
    "1996b , lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 ) , and their ultraviolet surface brightnesses are much higher , comparable to those of powerful starburst galaxies today ( meurer et al .  1997 ,",
    "giavalisco et al .",
    "again , this suggests that the similarity of the sfr distributions at @xmath79 and 3 may be , to a certain extent , a coincidence .",
    "the integral over the best fit to the uvlf shown in figure  9 gives a comoving 1500  luminosity density at @xmath2 of @xmath85  erg  s@xmath84  hz@xmath84  mpc@xmath86 , corresponding to a star formation density ( using the same salpeter conversion ) of @xmath87  yr@xmath84  mpc@xmath86 , again neglecting any correction for extinction .",
    "this value should be regarded as a lower limit because of the possibility of incompleteness in the ground  based sample , although comparison between wfpc2 and ground  based lyman limit samples suggests such incompleteness is not likely to exceed 30% .",
    "varying the procedure used to construct the data set changes the form of the luminosity function somewhat , and the integrated luminosity density varies from 1.6 to @xmath88  erg  s@xmath84  hz@xmath84  mpc@xmath86 because of these systematic changes  this is the dominant uncertainty , significantly exceeding shot noise in the data .",
    "as noted above , the integrated luminosity density of the hdf lyman break galaxies appears to be somewhat larger than that implied from the @xmath2 uvlf which is normalized by the ground  based sample , but uncertainties about the redshift selection function of the hdf sample make it hard to estimate by how much .",
    "if real , the excess could be the consequence either of clustering in the small hdf volume or of redshift evolution of the galaxy population , with a larger luminosity density present at the lower redshifts probed by the hdf lyman break color selection .",
    "the preceding discussion of the uvlf of lyman break galaxies and their star formation explicitly neglected the effect of extinction , which could be strong at ultraviolet wavelengths even if the dust content of these galaxies is relatively small .",
    "indeed we are reasonably sure that these objects do contain some amount of dust , as their lyman  @xmath6 emission lines are generally much weaker than expected from their uv  derived star formation rates under the assumption of case b recombination ( steidel et al.1996a ) .",
    "lyman  @xmath6 , however , is a resonance line and is easily extinguished with small amounts of dust , so there is little constraint on the dust content from this spectral feature .    a dust  free",
    ", star forming galaxy should have a very blue uv continuum  flat in @xmath89 units if star formation has been proceeding for @xmath90 years , or even bluer for very young starburst populations .",
    "if we examine the actual uv spectral slopes of lyman break galaxies , however , we find that they are mostly redder than flat spectrum in @xmath89 . figure  10 plots the @xmath91 color of more than 400 galaxies from our ground  based sample versus redshift . for this color combination knowing the redshift of each galaxy is important because lyman  @xmath6 forest opacity can effect the flux measured in the @xmath92band , making colors redder at larger redshifts independent of extinction internal to the galaxy . in figure 10 ,",
    "the predicted colors of star  forming galaxies are plotted versus redshift for various amounts of internal extinction .",
    "the unreddened models define the blue envelope of the color distribution , with nearly all galaxies being redder than the colors expected from a naked star forming galaxy .",
    "this effect is also seen in local starburst galaxy samples ( e.g. calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ) , and has been studied in lyman break galaxies by meurer et al .",
    "although for some objects this reddening of the uv spectral slope may be due to ageing of a starburst with a declining star formation rate , it is likely that some or most of the effect is indeed due to extinction .",
    "the difficulty in interpreting uv spectral slopes as a measure of extinction is that the inferred luminosity corrections are tremendously sensitive to the form of the reddening law at uv wavelengths . for local starburst galaxies ,",
    "an effective attenuation law has been derived which relates uv slope to total extinction ( cf .",
    "calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ; calzetti 1997 ) .",
    "the wavelength dependence of this attenuation law in the near  uv is very `` grey , '' such that a small change in the uv color requires a large change in the total extinction .",
    "varying the uv slope of the extinction law , as well as its normalization , can dramatically change the derived total suppression of uv galaxy luminosities .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 11 , where i have used the observed colors of lyman break galaxies in our spectroscopic sample to infer the uv extinction at 1500  under the assumption of two dust attenuation laws : the smc extinction curve and the local starburst extinction prescription of calzetti ( 1997 ) . without correction ,",
    "the star formation rates derived for the brightest galaxies in our sample are @xmath93/year . with smc extinction , they slightly exceed @xmath94/year , and the net correction to the overall star formation rate of the lyman break population is a factor of two . for the starburst attenuation law ,",
    "the most luminous galaxies approach sfrs of @xmath95/year , and the net correction to the _ observed _ population of galaxies is a factor of 7.1 ; the actual effect of dust on the global star formation rate would be larger because some intrinsically luminous but reddened galaxies would disappear from of a flux  limited sample .",
    "meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using an extinction relation calibrated for local starbursts using correlations between uv spectral slope and far  infrared emission , derive even larger correction factors of @xmath96 for the lyman break population , in part due to different assumptions about the spectral slope of the underlying , unreddened continuum .    at present",
    ", we have little direct information about the true effects of extinction on the uv luminosities of lyman break galaxies . while it is plausible that the attenuation law for local starburst galaxies may apply to their high redshift ancestors , the inferred effect on the global uv luminosity is so sensitive to small variations in the extinction law that one wishes for independent data at other wavelengths which could be used to verify star formation rates . in the future ,",
    "far  infrared measurements of thermally reradiated dust emission in lyman break galaxies may be possible from sirtf or wire , or with sub ",
    "millimeter observations with the instruments like scuba . in the meanwhile ,",
    "we have begun a program of near  infrared spectroscopy at ukirt to measure balmer line emission from lyman break galaxies , and thus provide an independent measure of their star formation rates which should be less sensitive to extinction .",
    "this work is painfully slow compared to optical multislit spectroscopy for measuring redshifts , requiring night  long exposures on one galaxy at a time .",
    "preliminary results are reported by pettini et al .",
    "1997 , and suggest that the star formation rates derived from the balmer emission may be a few times larger than those inferred from the uv continuum .",
    "a much larger sample is needed before we can make secure statements , but at least the problem is addressable by observation . moreover , the same is now true at low redshift .",
    "recently , tresse & maddox ( 1997 ) have derived an h@xmath6 lf for cfrs galaxies at @xmath97 , while treyer et al .  ( 1997 ) presented a near  uv lf for galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "comparison of these two lfs , converted to star formation rates , suggests that the uv luminosity density is underestimated of this local sample is suppressed by @xmath98 magnitude , presumably due to the effects of dust .",
    "one difficulty with the hdf wfpc2 data for studying galaxies at @xmath99 is that their optical rest  frame light is redshifted beyond the wfpc2 filter bandpasses .",
    "the wfpc2 images thus provide only an ultraviolet view of the @xmath99 universe .",
    "while this has advantages for detecting and studying active star formation in very distant galaxies , it makes it difficult to compare their properties to those of objects in the nearby universe at familiar rest  frame wavelengths .",
    "we may address this problem by collecting data on the nearby universe in the ultraviolet , or by studying hdf galaxies in the near  infrared .",
    "the hdf has been imaged in the infrared by several groups .",

    "for the hdf , despite the impressive observing efforts to date , we are unlikely ever to succeed in collecting hundreds of redshifts for @xmath0 galaxies with existing telescopes and instrumentation . however , we may take advantage of the insights gained from studying the lyman break galaxy population in non  hdf data sets to aid interpretation of the hdf objects , and thus to use the hdf to push the method to different flux and redshift limits .    regardless of how much we learn about high redshift galaxies in the hdf",
    ", we must remind ourselves of what a small volume the hdf probes . the entire comoving volume over which 300dropouts",
    "have been found in the hdf , @xmath27 , is only 18000@xmath135  mpc@xmath136 for @xmath117 .",
    "locally , that would correspond to a sphere with radius 16.2@xmath137 mpc  not even reaching the virgo cluster !",
    "we must therefore be cautious about how representative hdf galaxies are in any statistical sense , particularly in light of recent evidence for strong clustering at @xmath0 . the pencil ",
    "beam geometry of the hdf volume ensures that it will traverse a wider range of large scale structures than would the corresponding 14.2  mpc radius sphere locally , but such a geometry brings its own complications for some applications .",
    "for example , clustering may introduce large fluctuations in @xmath138 which can seriously complicate analyses of the redshift evolution of galaxy properties , global luminosity density , etc .",
    "it is therefore risky to extrapolate too far from the hdf to the properties of galaxies in the high redshift universe as a whole .",
    "ultimately , however , the insights gathered from the hdf , when calibrated with data from ground  based , large ",
    "volume surveys , should provide a powerful means of understanding the early stages in the evolution of normal galaxies .",
    "i would like to extend special thanks to my collaborators chuck steidel , mauro giavalisco , max pettini , kurt adelberger , and mindy kellogg , for endlessly interesting discussions , much hard work , and for allowing me to present materials in advance of publication .",
