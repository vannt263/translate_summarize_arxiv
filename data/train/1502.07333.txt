    "in contrast to the simplified tl model , studies on coupled dw systems which are commonly described by the quartic potentials are scanty @xcite , because a calculation of such a system is much tedious than that of the coupled tl model , even for the absence of applied fields .",
    "one of difficulties in studying coupled dw systems is that one can not obtain exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation for quartic dw potential .",
