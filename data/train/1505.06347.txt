    "mwc 480 was observed with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array as a part of the cycle 2 proposal 2013.1.00226 .",
    "observations were carried out on 2014 june 15 , with 33 antennas and baselines of 18650  m ( 15555  k@xmath16 ) .",
    "the total on source integration time was 22 minutes .",
    "the nearby quasar j0510 + 1800 was used for phase and gain , bandpass and absolute flux calibration ( j0510 + 1800 was itself calibrated to an absolute flux of 1.50[0.08 ] jy on 2014 june 29 ) .",
    "the correlator was configured to observe 14 spectral windows ( spws ) with resolution @xmath17= 61.04 khz .",
    "the h@xmath12cn 32 line was placed in spw 1 , hc@xmath0n 27 - 26 in spw 9 and ch@xmath0cn 14@xmath18 - 13@xmath19 and 14@xmath20 - 13@xmath21 in spw 5 , each 60120  mhz wide and centered on 258.983 , 245.622 and 257.498 ghz , respectively .",
    "the visibility data were calibrated by alma/ naasc staff following standard procedures .",
    "each spw was further self - calibrated in phase and amplitude in casa 4.2.2 . the self - calibrated phase and gain spw - specific solutions were applied to create individual spw line data cubes using the briggs weighting scheme , with brigg s robustness parameter set to 12 . for the weak ch@xmath0cn lines , a taper of 1@xmath22",
    "was applied to the visibilties to maximize the signal - to - noise .",
    "the data cubes were subsequently continuum subtracted using channels identified as free of spectral line emission .",
    "the resulting rms noise in 1 km / s bins was @xmath132.3  mjy per beam .",
    "a clean deconvolution was performed with a mask produced manually based on the h@xmath12cn emission and applied to the hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0cn spectral line cubes ( after verifying that the hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0cn cubes contained no additional emission ) .",
    "for the 257  ghz continuum map , obtained by combining all spws in the usb ) , the synthesized beam is @xmath23 ( pa=-7 ) and rms noise 0.3  mjy beam@xmath24 .",
    "the 257 ghz continuum flux density was determined to be 331@xmath533  mjy ( assuming a 10% uncertainty in the absolute calibration ) , which agrees well with previous submillimer array results@xmath25 .",
    "integrated emission maps were produced using the @xmath26 task in casa , adding emission @xmath271@xmath8 from each channel .",
    "lower clipping levels do not change the result at the 10% level .",
    "spectra were extracted using both the empirical clean masks and theoretical masks based on keplerian rotation to isolate disk emission in each channel .",
    "the clean masks resulted in the best signal - to - noise ratio , and these results are used in the study .",
    "we adopt a previously developed disk density structure of mwc 480@xcite .",
    "the total surface density is given by the similarity solution , which self - consistently describes the density structure of an accretion disk@xmath28 :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a normalization coefficient , @xmath31 is the characteristic radius , and @xmath32 is a gradient parameter describing the density fall - off with radius .",
    "the two - dimensional density structure in cylindrical coordinates is    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the scale height , and @xmath35 a parameter that describes the amount of flaring of the disk .",
    "the density structure parameters were constrained using high angular resolution observations of the mwc 480 dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm wavelengths @xcite and are listed in extended data table 1 .",
    "the resulting mass surface densities in g @xmath36 are @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 at 1 , 10 and 100 au , respectively .    based on existing model fits to dust and @xmath12co observations@xmath40 , the disk midplane temperature is parametrized as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is set to 23  k at @xmath43  au , and the power - law index @xmath44 is 0.4 . to account for the presence of a vertical temperature gradient due to heating of the disk surface by the central star@xmath45 , we parameterize the two - dimensional temperature structure in cylindrical coordinates as    @xmath46    where @xmath42 is the midplane temperature at @xmath47 , @xmath44 is a power - law index describing the decrease in midplane temperature with radius , and @xmath48 is a factor describing the increase in temperature at increasing disk height , which is set to 1.5@xmath49 .",
    "the density and temperature disk structures are shown in extended data fig . 1 .      to retrieve molecular abundance and column density profiles , we define parametric abundance models with respect to the adopted mwc 480 disk density and temperature structure .",
    "we use a simple power - law prescription @xmath50 for the molecular abundances where @xmath51 is the abundance of the molecule with respect to the total hydrogen density , @xmath52 is the abundance at 100 au , @xmath53 is the disk radius in au , and @xmath54 is a power law index@xmath55 . to obtain a column density profile ,",
    "which is more intuitively related to observations , the abundance prescription is multiplied by disk surface density profile , eq .",
    "1 . we set an outer cut - off radius of 100  au , corresponding to the most extended emission observed for any of the cyanides .",
    "we also explored @xmath56 of 60 and 80  au , but this did not improve the fit for any of the molecules . for each molecule",
    ", we calculate a grid of abundance models that covers @xmath52 from @xmath57 with respect to @xmath58 , and @xmath54 between 0 and 1 for h@xmath12cn , 1 and 2 for hc@xmath0n , 0 and 2 for ch@xmath0cn .",
    "these initial ranges of @xmath54 were selected based on visual inspection of the observed emission , noting its level of central concentration , i.e. @xmath59 corresponds to a steeply decreasing column density profile , @xmath60 to an almost flat profile , and @xmath61 to an increasing profile with radius .",
    "the best - fit models are obtained by minimizing @xmath62 , the weighted difference between the real and imaginary part of the complex visibility measured in the @xmath63-plane sampled by the alma observations@xmath64 .",
    "we use the three - dimensional monte carlo code lime@xmath65 to calculate the radiative transfer and molecular excitation .",
    "in addition to the molecular abundance profile and the disk density and temperature structure parameters , the radiative transfer modelling requires information on disk inclination , turbulence and velocity field .",
    "we adopted a disk inclination of 37@xmath66 , disk turbulence of 0.05 km / s and a keplerian velocity field with a stellar mass of 1.8 m@xmath4@xcite .",
    "for hcn and hc@xmath0n , the level populations were computed in non - lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) with collision rates listed in the basecol database@xmath67 . for ch@xmath0cn , we assumed lte , which is a reasonable approximation , since the expected disk emissive layers have higher densities than the critical density .",
    "we checked this assumption by running several hcn and hc@xmath0n models assuming lte and found a good agreement ( within 20% ) between lte and non - lte models .",
    "in extended data fig .",
    "2 we show the best - fit models for different @xmath54 . in the case of hc@xmath0n , only the models with @xmath61 shows the observed ring - like structure and are therefore the only ones considered further .    within the adopted model framework ,",
    "the molecular abundances and abundance ratios are constrained within a factor of a few .",
    "these models implicitly assume a constant abundance profile with disk height , which may be a poor approximation in the outer disk where freeze - out in the midplane results in a vertically layered structure@xcite@xmath68 .",
    "the existing data are , however , insufficient to put any constraints on the vertical distribution . rather than pursuing a more complex model , we opt to test the sensitivity of the derived abundances and abundance ratios on the details of the vertical structure assumptions .",
    "we ran a second grid of models to simulate the effect of freeze - out in the midplane by reducing the molecular abundances by three orders of magnitude at @xmath69 . using the same fitting procedure as before , we find best - fit @xmath70 of @xmath71 ( @xmath54=0 ) , @xmath72 ( @xmath54=2 ) , and @xmath73 ( @xmath54=1 ) , for h@xmath12cn , hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0cn , respectively .",
    "these abundances are an order of magnitude higher than those obtained assuming a vertically constant abundance .",
    "the ch@xmath0cn / h@xmath12cn abundance ratio profile is unchanged within the model uncertainties , however . despite a higher excitation level of ch@xmath0cn the two molecules",
    "emit from a similar disk layer when assigned the same vertical abundance profile due to a combination of a high critical density of the ch@xmath0cn transition and a rapid fall - off in density with disk height , i.e. practically no ch@xmath0cn emission originates at @xmath74 .",
    "in contrast , the derived hc@xmath0n / hcn ratio does depend on the vertical structure .",
    "the hc@xmath0n transition has an even higher energy level and a lower critical density than ch@xmath0cn , which implies that some of the hc@xmath0n emission can originate in more elevated disk layers than h@xmath12cn and ch@xmath0cn .",
    "the reported ch@xmath0cn / h@xmath12cn results are thus robust to the abundance model assumptions , while the reported hc@xmath0n / h@xmath12cn results may be overestimated by up to an order magnitude .      to constrain the origin of ch@xmath0cn and therefore how its ice - to - gas ratio compares with hcn",
    ", we first explore how much of the observed ch@xmath0cn gas could come from gas - phase chemistry .",
    "we ran a grid of pseudo - time dependent models with a complete gas - phase chemistry@xmath75 , but without any grain surface reactions ( except for adsorption and desorption , and h@xmath14 formation on grains ) , for 1 myr .",
    "the grid covers several orders of magnitude of densities , temperatures , uv fields and ionization fractions ",
    "the four most important regulators of gas - phase chemistry in disks . for gas - phase ch@xmath0cn production ,",
    "the ionization rate is expected to be of special importance because the main gas - phase formation pathway includes ch@xmath76 ( through hcn+ch@xmath76 , which has a expert - validated reaction rate in the kida database@xmath77 ) .",
    "extended data figure 3 shows that none of these models can produce ch@xmath0cn / hcn @xmath270.01 and that in the vast majority of the parameter space ch@xmath0cn / hcn@xmath60.001 .",
    "a ratio of 0.01 is approached for an ionization rate of 10@xmath78 s@xmath24 , but such high ionization rates are only attained in the disk atmosphere where stellar x - rays regulate the ionization balance .",
    "this disk layer contain a very small fraction of the total disk mass and therefore contributes a negligible amount of the total molecular column .",
    "deeper into the disk , the ionization rate is reduced below 10@xmath79 s@xmath24 because of attenuation of both x - rays and cosmic rays@xmath80 .",
    "a ratio of 0.01 is also approached at lower ionization rates at very low temperatures and high densities .",
    "such environments are characteristic for the outer disk midplane , which contain a lot of mass , but freeze - out at these temperatures results in ch@xmath0cn abundances below 10@xmath78 , which would not contribute to the observed ch@xmath0cn emission .",
    "the observed high abundance of ch@xmath0cn gas with respect to hcn therefore implies that grain surface chemistry contributes significantly to the observed ch@xmath0cn abundance .",
    "we ran a number of complete disk chemistry models for 1myr , the estimated age of the mwc 480 star+disk system , which include gas and grain surface chemistry , as well as different levels of turbulence , to calculate the range of plausible ice - to - gas conversion factors for hcn ( and other gas - phase chemistry products ) and ch@xmath0cn@xmath81 .",
    "the main grain surface ch@xmath0cn formation pathways in these models are hydrogenation of c@xmath14n and ch@xmath0+cn and ice photochemistry .",
    "the main desorption pathway is uv photodesorption because of the high binding energies of hcn .",
    "hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0cn : 4170 , 4580 , and 4680  k , respectively@xmath82 , respectively , corresponding to sublimation temperatures of @xmath1390  k at a gas density of 10@xmath83 @xmath84 and 110  k at the gas density of 10@xmath85 @xmath84 .",
    "the three cyanides should also present very similar uv photodesorption efficiencies because of similar radiation cross - sections and binding energies@xmath86 .",
    "absent grain surface chemistry , these molecules would thus have had comparable ice - to - gas ratios .    because ch@xmath0cn can form on the grains in the cold midplane",
    "a key feature is the coupling between the ice formation layer and the disk layers where molecules are efficiently desorbed into the gas - phase .",
    "without such a coupling , ice chemistry can not affect the gas - phase volatile composition . in the disk models ,",
    "we define the vertical diffusion coefficient as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a free parameter , @xmath89 is the local sound velocity , and @xmath90 is the keplerian orbital frequency .",
    "different levels of turbulence are simulated by different values of @xmath88 between 0 and 0.01 . in models with",
    "turbulence turned off ( @xmath91 ) , there is no mixing between the cold , icy midplane and the intermediate layers where gas - phase molecules are abundant ( and the observed cyanides likely reside ) .",
    "extended data figure 4a shows that without turbulence the predicted ch@xmath0cn abundances are low everywhere ( @xmath92 w.r.t @xmath58 , where @xmath58 is the number density of h nuclei ) and the vertically averaged ch@xmath0cn / hcn abundance ratio is @xmath60.001 ; see extended data figure 5a , d ) .    in models that include vertical mixing ( @xmath93 ) , the ch@xmath0cn abundance as well as the ch@xmath0cn / hcn abundance ratio",
    "are enhanced by an order of magnitude because of mixing of midplane icy grains into uv exposed disk regions where the ices photodesorb ( extended data figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "in particular the ch@xmath0cn / hcn ratio approaches 10@xmath94 outside of 30  au , within an order of magnitude of the observed ratios .",
    "model - data comparison thus suggest that the intermediate disk layers are strongly coupled to the icy midplane through mixing .",
    "this implies that gas - phase observations of ch@xmath0cn and other cyanides at intermediate disk heights can be used to trace the total volatile reservoir , even if the conversion from gas to ice can be complex .    using the three models , with no , moderate and strong mixing we calculate the hcn and ch@xmath0cn ice - to - gas density and column density ratios as a function of disk radius ( extended data fig .",
    "for hcn , the ice - to - gas ratio varies between 10@xmath95 and 10@xmath3 between 30 and 100  au .",
    "for ch@xmath0cn the ice - to - gas ratio varies between 10@xmath96 and 10@xmath97 . in other disk chemistry",
    "models@xcite@xmath98 the contrast between the two ice - to - gas ratios is even higher . considering the range of values and their sensitive dependence on assumptions about disk turbulence ,",
    "we conclude that the ice - to - gas ratio for ch@xmath0cn is at least 10 times higher than hcn and hc@xmath0n . at",
    "longer time scales the balance between formation in the midplane and destruction at more exposed disk layers determines whether the ch@xmath0cn abundance increases or decreases  in general the more turbulence the faster the destruction .",
    "it is important to note , that we employ generic disk structures@xmath99 that have not been fit to the mwc 480 data .",
    "the temperature and density structures are comparable ( cf .",
    "extended data figs . 1 and 4 ) .",
    "the uv field is lower than would be expected toward a herbig ae star and the gas - phase ch@xmath0cn production may therefore be somewhat overestimated in our model , but as shown above , gas - phase chemistry is a minor contributor to the overall ch@xmath0cn gas budget .",
    "the grain surface production takes place in uv shielded regions and should thus not be affected by an increased uv flux .",
    "an increased uv field intensity may change the desorption / adsorption balance , however , since uv photodesorption is an important desorption mechanism .",
    "this increase in photodesorption will be accompanied by an increased level photodissociation and the main effect will therefore be to push the desorbing layer closer to the midplane rather than increasing its abundance .",
    "an a star type radiation field may aid the detection of gas - phase ch@xmath0cn , since less turbulence may be required to bring the icy grains up to uv exposure and into the gas - phase .",
    "a decrease in the disk height of the cyanide gas layer , compared to our generic disk model , may also reduce the absolute ice - to - gas ratios , but the relative ratios of species with similar adsorption and desorption characteristics should not be significantly affected .      in our disk chemistry model ,",
    "uv photodesorption regulates the desorption of oh hcn , hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0cn ice into the gas - phase .",
    "this result depends on a combination of disk and star properties and on the theoretical yields of different desorption mechanisms , many of which are poorly constrained . while relative ice - to - gas ratios of related species are insensitive to the details of the desorption process , the absolute ice - to - gas ratios found in our models must be considered highly uncertain .",
    "based on theory , different desorption mechanisms should present different radial and vertical abundance distributions , which could be tested observationally .",
    "desorption due to release of chemical formation energy should be most important in the cold disk midplane , while uv photodesorption is only efficient in warmer , upper disk layers , and thermal desorption in the disk layers that are warm enough .",
    "in particular , colder molecular emission layers should be characterized by lower excitation temperatures , which can be measured when multiple lines of the same species are observed .",
    "observational constraints on ice desorption in disks will thus be attainable with alma .",
    "different desorption mechanisms should also exhibit different chemical signatures , although the details are often model - dependent . in the case of thermal desorption ,",
    "the gas phase composition in a layer should simply depend on volatility , albeit with the added complication of ice entrapment@xmath100 .",
    "chemistry can also help distinguish between ice and gas origins and thus provide an independent measure of the relative importance of the two pathways .",
    "he high ratio of ch@xmath0cn / ch@xmath0nc in the horsehead pdr ( photon dominated region ) , for example , was used as evidence for a grain surface origin of the observed ch@xmath0cn@xmath101 .",
    "chemical tracers could also provide useful constraints on the incident radiation fields and temperature structure and thus aid in ruling out some of the potentially important desorption mechanisms .",
    "for example cn / hcn is a proposed tracer of uv flux and hnc / hcn of temperature@xmath102 .",

    "<S> the mwc 480 disk is 23 times warmer at a given radius@xcite and exposed to orders of magnitude higher ultraviolet radiation levels . despite these environmental differences the volatile composition in the mwc 480 disk appears largely similar to that of disks around solar - type stars , except for lower abundance of cold ( t@xmath620  k ) chemistry tracers in the outer disk @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the inner disk chemistry of mwc 480 has not been studied , but herbig ae and t tauri disks are observed to present different volatile compositions close to their stars@xcite .    using the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , we detected two emission lines of ch@xmath0cn from the mwc 480 protoplanetary disk ( the 14@xmath7 line at 5@xmath8 , and the 14@xmath9 line at 3.5@xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also detected emission lines from the n - bearing carbon chain hc@xmath0n , and from the 13-c isotopologue of hcn . </S>",
    "<S> we targeted the 13-c isotopologue rather than the more abundant h@xmath10cn because the latter is optically thick and therefore a poor tracer of the hcn abundance . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the spatially resolved line detections together with a dust continuum emission map , demonstrating the spatial coincidence between ch@xmath0cn , hc@xmath0n , hcn and dust emission from the disk . </S>",

    "<S> the emission is also spectrally resolved , which can be used to probe smaller spatial scales . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the velocity gradient across the disk that arises from keplerian rotation in all three lines . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows the spectra of the three lines ; each displays the double - peaked structure typical of a rotating disk . </S>",
    "<S> table 1 lists the integrated line fluxes .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the spectrally and spatially resolved line emission to constrain the radial profiles of molecular column density based on parametric abundance models defined with respect to the adopted mwc 480 disk density and temperature structure ( methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> figures 2 and 3a - c show the synthetic line spectra and maps from the best - fit models , demonstrating the good match between the models and data . </S>",
    "<S> figures 3d - f shows the best - fit radial column density profile , together with all profiles consistent with the data within 3@xmath8 , and abundances at 30 and 100  au are reported in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit profiles have different slopes for the different molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath12cn column density decreases with radius , which is consistent with predictions from disk chemistry models@xcite . the increasing column density with radius of hc@xmath0n , effectively a ring , is not predicted by models@xcite , indicative of that disk chemistry models are incomplete for hc@xmath0n . </S>",
    "<S> the ch@xmath0cn emission is best reproduced with a flat profile , but other profiles can not be excluded . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute abundances depend on the assumed disk density structure , and we therefore compare the complex cyanides in the mwc 480 disk to comet and to protostellar compositions using hcn as a reference species , similar to the practice in cometary studies@xcite . we calculate abundances of ch@xmath0cn and hc@xmath0n with respect to hcn at 30 au , the smallest disk radius accessible by the alma observations , and at 100  au , the outer boundary of the cyanide emission maps . </S>",
    "<S> accounting for the higher luminosity of mwc 480 compared to the young sun , this radial range in the mwc 480 disk corresponds to the comet forming zone of 1030  au in the solar nebula@xcite . assuming a standard hcn / h@xmath12cn ratio of 70 , the best - fit hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0cn abundances with respect to hcn are 0.4 and 0.05 at 30  au , and 5 and 0.2 at 100  au , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the ch@xmath0cn / hcn abundance ratios are robust to model assumptions to within factors of a few , while the hc@xmath0n / hcn abundance ratio may be overestimated by an order of magnitude using our simple abundance model ( methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> conservatively , both the ch@xmath0cn and hc@xmath0n abundances with respect to hcn are thus @xmath135% at 30  au and @xmath1320% at 100  au . </S>",
    "<S> a typical comet contains 10% of ch@xmath0cn and hc@xmath0n with respect to hcn@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mwc 480 gas - phase cyanide composition at both 30 and 100  au is thus cometary within the observational and model uncertainties .    </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between gas - phase abundance ratios and the abundance ratios in ices , the main volatile reservoirs in disks@xcite , depends on both desorption characteristics and chemistry ( methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> hcn , hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0cn are characterized by similar freeze - out and desorption kinetics , but different chemical pathways . in particular , the existence of efficient grain surface formation pathways to ch@xmath0cn enhances ch@xmath0cn with respect to the other cyanides in the ice mantles . </S>",
    "<S> the scale of this enhancement factor varies among models , but it is at least one order of magnitude ( methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an expected minimum ch@xmath0cn / hcn ice ratio of 0.5 at 30  au in the mwc 480 disk , considerably higher than the typical solar system comet .    </S>",
    "<S> the ch@xmath0cn / hcn and hc@xmath0n / hcn ratios in the mwc 480 disk are also high when compared to protostars . </S>",
    "<S> the hcn / hc@xmath0n / ch@xmath0cn ratio is 1/0.01/0.08 toward the solar - type protostellar binary iras 16298 - 2422@xcite , and similar abundance ratios are found toward more massive systems . </S>",
    "<S> the mwc 480 cyanide composition is thus difficult to explain by inheritance alone , as has been suggested for e.g. h@xmath14o@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rather the observed high disk abundances likely reflect an efficient disk chemistry that readily converts a large portion of the carbon originally in co and other small molecules into more complex organics@xcite during the first million years of the disk life time . </S>",
    "<S> this early , efficient complex chemistry in protoplanetary disks impacts the surface conditions of rocky ( exo-)planets . in the grand tack model of early solar system dynamics@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the coupled migration of jupiter and saturn in the gas - rich disk from which they formed caused scattering of volatile - rich ( and thus complex organic - rich ) planetesimals inwards , mixing with the asteroid belt , and outwards , producing the present - day kuiper belt and comets@xcite . while comets are expected ( and observed ) to conserve most of their original compositions due to low temperatures and thus very long desorption and chemical time scales@xcite , asteroid belt bodies are more processed . </S>",
    "<S> a combination of evaporation and chemistry probably resulted in both a net loss of volatiles and in a relative enhancement of complex organics with respect to h@xmath14o over the subsequent 10s of myr@xcite . a second instability 100 million years later resulted in a heavy bombardment of the earth by mainly asteroid belt bodies , including the icy bodies originating in the outer solar system@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of these instabilities in exo - planetary systems is unknown , but the pile - up of hot jupiters and super - earths reveal that major planetary migrations are common . when these migrations cause bombardment of icy bodies , they are likely organic - rich .    </S>",
    "<S> the high ratio of complex to simple cyanides in the mwc 480 disk implies that the rich organic composition of comets is not unique to our solar system , and could be common - place . </S>",
    "<S> laboratory experiments have shown that the same ice chemistry that produce ch@xmath0cn , i.e. photo processing of interstellar ice analogs also produce simple sugars and amino acids@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the early surface conditions of earth , set by comet and asteroid bombardment , may be common for young rocky planets , and that conditions favourable to an even richer chemistry may be ubiquitous .    </S>",
