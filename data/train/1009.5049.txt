    "for an ultrashort laser pulse that lasts for only a few cycles , its carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) can dramatically affect the yield of matter - laser interaction  @xcite , leading to cep dependence of electron ionization  @xcite and harmonic - photon emission  @xcite .",
    "recently , with the rapid development of the laser technology , cep has become a new way to control the dynamic process of matter - laser interaction  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the cep effect for an intense laser pulse can be measured by comparing the photoelectron yields in two opposite directions along the laser s electric field  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the cep effect on bound - bound transition of an atom has been investigated theoretically  @xcite and observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "roudnev and esry have presented a general framework for understanding the cep effect using the floquet theory  @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have demonstrated that an experimentally observed cep effect can be attributed to the interference between one- and three - photon transition pathways  @xcite .",
    "the study by nakajima and watanabe suggests that the cep effect can occur as the laser s carrier frequency is far off - resonance  @xcite .    in this paper , we use hylleraas coordinates to study numerically how the cep effect on bound - bound transitions of helium changes as a function of the carrier frequency of an ultrashort laser .",
    "our numerical results show that the cep effect depends sensitively on the carrier frequency even when it is far off - resonance . the essential physics implied in these numerical results",
    "can be well revealed by a two - level model .",
    "for a two - level system , when the pulse duration is long , quantum transitions peak at well - separated multi - photon resonant frequencies . as the pulse duration decreases to less than three laser cycles , for example , the widths of such transition peaks get significantly broadened , and eventually two broadened neighboring transition peaks can cross with each other . as a result , two different multi - photon transitions can both contribute significantly to the total transition amplitude and hence interfere with each other .",
    "we show that a large cep effect occurs exactly at these crossings and can hence be understood as a quantum interference effect  @xcite .",
    "a general and simple picture developed along this line enables us to clearly answer the following questions : ( 1 ) why is the cep effect on bound - bound transitions sensitive to a carrier frequency that is far - off resonance ? ( 2 ) which multi - photon transition pathways can interfere and lead to the cep effect ?",

    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the pulse duration is @xmath9 .",
    "the wave function of helium @xmath10 is expanded in terms of the field - free eigenvectors @xmath11 : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . then we numerically solve the following set of equations for the amplitudes @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",

    "874 hylleraas functions are used with the total angular momentum quantum number @xmath21 ranging from 0 to 4 .",

    "results for the @xmath26 state ( squares ) are shown in panel ( a ) and those for the @xmath27 state ( circles ) are shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "it is clear from the figure that there are many carrier frequency windows in which @xmath25 peaks at about its maximum value of 2 , indicating a strong cep effect on the transition probabilities from the ground state to the two excited states .",
    "these numerical details qualitatively agree with those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors changed the energy difference between two bound states instead .",
    "one important feature in fig . [ fig : m1 ] is that the cep effect is very sensitive to the carrier frequency even it is far off - resonance as compared with the energy difference between the two bound states .",
    "this implies that far off - resonance is not a sufficient condition for a large cep effect . in the following , we attempt to answer the following question : what is the physics underlying these narrow frequency windows where the parameter @xmath25 peaks ?",
    "we have compared our full numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ]  ( a ) to the results of a two - level model ( to be elaborated below ) .",
    "as clearly shown in the figure , except the peak positions are shifted towards lower frequencies , the two - level results ( the ( green ) dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ]  ( a ) ) can embody the main features in the full numerical results for @xmath32 .",
    "this indicates that a simple two - level model is sufficient to reflect the essential physics behind these peaks . in the following ,",
    "we first study a two - level model , and then investigate multi - level influence on the cep effect .",
    "consider a two - level system in a pulsed laser field .",
    "the ground and the first excited states of helium are chosen as the two levels , denoted as @xmath33 and @xmath34 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ode ] ) , the amplitudes of these two states obey the following equations @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the transition dipole moment between two quantum states @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 being laser s electric field and @xmath41 the energy difference between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "if the system is initially in the ground state , a formal solution of @xmath42 , after the laser pulse has passed , can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents the @xmath45-photon _ quantum transition amplitude_. for example , @xmath46 is for one - photon transition amplitude and @xmath47 is for three - photon transition amplitude .    ,",
    "where @xmath48 is the energy spacing between the two bound states.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    to clearly understand the physics behind each amplitude @xmath44 , we first consider the limit of long pulse duration , i.e. , @xmath49 , which is easier to deal with . in this limit , after neglecting the negative frequency components  @xcite , the @xmath45-photon transition amplitude @xmath44 can be decomposed into a sum of @xmath50 terms , i.e. , @xmath51 where @xmath52\\exp[-i(2j+1)\\phi]\\,.\\ ] ] this implies that , physically , each term @xmath53 can be associated with a quantum transition pathway , which carries a phase @xmath54 and contributes significantly to the overall transition amplitude at resonant frequency @xmath55 .",
    "these quantum transition pathways are depicted schematically in figure  [ fig : level1 ] , where the @xmath56th column shows all the pathways involving @xmath57 photons and the @xmath58th row includes all the pathways that have a resonant frequency at @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    with the decomposition in eq.([eq : tp ] ) , it is clear that the overall transition amplitude @xmath42 is significantly different from zero only at resonance frequencies . at the same time",
    ", we notice that all the pathways at a given resonance frequency @xmath62 carry the same phase @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the cep @xmath8 does not affect the magnitude of @xmath42 .",
    "this clearly explains why there is no cep effect for a long - pulsed laser .     with @xmath63 ( solid curves ) , @xmath64 (",
    "dashed curves ) , and @xmath65 ( dash - dotted curves ) for pulse duration ( a ) @xmath66 , ( b ) @xmath67 , ( c ) @xmath68 , and ( d ) @xmath69 laser cycle(s ) .",
    "the arrows in panel ( c ) indicate the interference between @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( right ) and @xmath70 and @xmath72 ( left ) ; the arrows in panel ( d ) indicate the interference between @xmath73 and @xmath70 ( right ) and @xmath70 and @xmath72 ( left).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the situation becomes very different as the laser pulse becomes shorter .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the decomposition in eq.([eq : tp ] ) still holds even for short laser pulse .",
    "however , as the pulse becomes shorter , @xmath53 is no longer proportional to a delta function as in eq.([eq : delta ] ) , but becomes a function of the laser s frequency which peaks at @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , the width of the peak associated with each transition path @xmath53 broadens as the pulse duration gets shorter . consequently ,",
    "when the pulse is very short , e.g. , lasting only for a few cycles , the peaks can become so wide that the peaks for pathways @xmath53 with different @xmath74 s can cross with each other at a certain far off - resonance frequency . as a result",
    ", the overall transition amplitude @xmath42 can be regarded as an interference between the two pathways , if it is dominated by this pair of pathways at the crossing point . at the same time",
    ", we notice that each pathway @xmath53 carries the phase @xmath54 , indicating that the relative phase between this pair of pathways depend on the cep @xmath8 .",
    "these facts mean that the overall transition amplitude @xmath42 depends on @xmath8 at the crossing point and is strongly affected by the cep .",
    "the above analysis is confirmed by our detailed numerical calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpd ] , where we analyze the amplitude @xmath75 as a function of the laser s carrier frequency for different pulse durations while the cep is fixed at @xmath76 . as clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpd](a ) , for a laser pulse of 20 cycles , the peaks at resonance frequencies @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are narrow and well separated .",
    "particularly , in consistent with the above picture for the long pulse limit , one finds that the magnitude of @xmath46 has one peak located at @xmath77 , indicating the contribution from @xmath73 ; whereas the magnitude of @xmath47 has two peaks located at @xmath77 and @xmath78 , indicating the respective contributions from @xmath71 and @xmath70 .",
    "finally the magnitude of @xmath80 has three peaks located at @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , due to @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "as the pulse is shortened to seven cycles , there is no essential change in the overall features : only each peak becomes wider , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpd](b ) , which shows that the decomposition for short pulses in eq.([eq : tp ] ) is well justified .",
    "it is a very different situation when the pulse is shortened to 3 cycles . in this case , the peaks become so broad that they begin to overlap and cross into each other . as indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpd ] ( c ) , there are two crossings .",
    "one occurs at @xmath83 , where the peak associated with @xmath71 crosses with the peak associated with @xmath70 .",
    "the other crossing happens at @xmath84 , where the peak associated with @xmath70 crosses with the peak associated with @xmath72 . at such crossing points ,",
    "the two dominant pathways have the same magnitude , which is essential for effective interference and strong cep effect . finally , when the pulse duration is decreased to one laser cycle in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpd ]  ( d ) , the contributions from the pathways @xmath73 and @xmath70 cross with each other at @xmath85 and the contributions from @xmath70 and @xmath72 cross at @xmath86 . compared with the two - level results in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ] , it is seen that the cep effect occurs exactly at the frequencies where the crossings between the broadened peaks occur .     with @xmath87 , as a function of laser s carrier frequency .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",

    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : tp ] ( b ) and ( d ) that the phase difference @xmath92 is around @xmath93 at @xmath76 and around zero at @xmath88 .",
    "this means that when @xmath88 , the contributions to the total transition amplitude from @xmath46 and @xmath94 constructively interfere , whereas at @xmath76 they destructively interfere , leading to a significant cep effect at @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the cep effect is the result of the @xmath8-dependent interference between the one - photon contribution @xmath46 and the three - photon contribution @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , the strong cep effect at @xmath86 can be attributed to the @xmath8-dependent interference between the three - photon amplitude @xmath47 and the five - photon amplitude @xmath80 .",
    "based on this simple picture , it is apparent that the cep effect often appears at a carrier frequency that is _ off resonance _ : the contributions to the total transition amplitude from two different pathways with different @xmath74 s can be comparable only at a frequency that is _ not _ equal to the resonance frequency @xmath62 .    in principle ,",
    "if the pulse duration is short enough , the transition amplitudes , which are contributed by any two neighboring pathways associated with different resonance frequencies @xmath62 s , can interfere with each other .",
    "as such , one might expect the curve of @xmath95 vs @xmath7 to have an infinite number of peaks .",
    "however , since the transition amplitude associated with a multi - photon pathway decreases rapidly with the number of photons involved , the actual number of clear cep peaks will be limited by the highest order of multi - photon transitions that can have a significant transition amplitude .",
    "for example , in our two - level model with the laser intensity adopted , the highest multi - photon order is five , thus yielding only two peaks in the curve of @xmath95 vs @xmath7 ; these two peaks arise from the interference between one- and three - photon pathways , as well as between three- and five - photon pathways .",
    "if the laser intensity is further increased , then more cep peaks can be expected .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite presented an example of the cep effect caused by the interference between the one- and three - photon pathways , which is just one of many possible peaks in our general picture .",
    "we next describe some computational details regarding how the laser intensity and the laser pulse duration change the cep effect .",
    "figure  [ fig : a1-d - i](a ) depicts how the two cep frequencies ( i.e. , the carrier frequencies at which the @xmath25 can reach a large value ) vary with the laser intensity , where the pulse duration is fixed at @xmath69 laser cycle .",
    "figure  [ fig : a1-d - i](b ) shows the impact of the pulse duration , with the laser intensity fixed at @xmath28  w/@xmath29 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : a1-d - i](a ) that the cep frequency increases slightly as the intensity increases .",
    "this is because the magnitude of the multi - photon transition contribution @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath96 , with @xmath97 being the laser intensity .",
    "as such , the amplitudes of higher order multi - photon transitions increase with the laser intensity much faster than those of lower order ones , resulting in that the crossing of neighboring peaks associated with different transition pathways occurs at higher frequencies as the laser intensity increases .",
    "turning to the pulse duration dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a1-d - i](b ) , it is observed that the cep frequencies are also slightly blue shifted as the pulse duration increases , indicating that the crossing between neighboring peaks occurs at slightly higher frequencies as the pulse duration increases .",
    "when the pulse duration is larger than about four laser cycles , the cep effect disappears for @xmath98  w/@xmath29 , implying the vanishing of crossing between any two neighboring multi - photon transition pathways .     of @xmath46 , as well as the magnitudes of the transition amplitudes formed respectively by the sub - path 0 - 1 - 0 - 1 ( dashed line ) and by the sub - path 0 - 1 - 2 - 1 ( solid line ) associated with @xmath47 , as a function of the laser s carrier frequency . the results",
    "are obtained using a three - level model . in panel",
    "( a ) the cep parameter is given by @xmath76 and in panel ( b ) the cep parameter is given by @xmath88 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "for a real atom , laser - atom interaction induces transitions among many states . as such , we need to consider the influence of multi - level transitions on the final population of the state of interest . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ]  ( a ) , the results of the two - level model disagree quantitatively with the full numerical calculations : the two peaks at @xmath85 and @xmath86 appeared in the two - level model are red - shifted as compared to the peaks at @xmath99 and @xmath100 found in the full numerical approach .",
    "one is then motivated to examine a three - level model that incorporates @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath101 states of helium .",
    "interestingly , the first peak found in this 3-level model agrees well with the full numerical calculations , but the other peaks are still red - shifted as compared with those found in the full numerical calculations .",
    "finally , we include one more level , i.e. , @xmath102 , in the dynamics and hence obtain a four - level model .",
    "the results from such a four - level model are found to agree well with the full numerical results for the frequency region considered here .",
    "detailed comparisons between these models are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ] .    the above - mentioned quantitative differences between various models can be explained by analyzing the transition pathways in multi - level situations .",
    "consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) again .",
    "now the term @xmath47 for the three - level model includes two integrals :    @xmath103    where the two integrals correspond to the following two sub - paths : @xmath104 ( 0 - 1 - 0 - 1 ) and @xmath105 ( 0 - 1 - 2 - 1 ) .",
    "clearly both sub - paths can contribute significantly to the total quantum transition amplitude from state @xmath33 to state @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the transition dipole moment @xmath106 between states @xmath34 and @xmath107 is larger than the transition dipole moment @xmath108 between states @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see table i ) .",
    "this indicates that the transition amplitude from @xmath34 to @xmath107 is more substantial than that from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "it can be estimated that the contribution by the sub - path 0 - 1 - 2 - 1 of @xmath47 is about one order of magnitude larger than that by the sub - path 0 - 1 - 0 - 1 . a detailed numerical comparison between them is shown in fig .  [ fig:3level - tp1 ] .",
    "therefore the role of the sub - path 0 - 1 - 0 - 1 in the previous two - level model should be replaced by the sub - path of 0 - 1 - 2 - 1 in the present three - level model , thus explaining the quantitative difference between a two - level model and a three - level model .    similarly , for the interference between the pathways of @xmath47 and @xmath80 that accounts for the second peak at @xmath100 in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1](a ) , the contribution of the sub - path 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 to the magnitude of @xmath80 is larger than the contributions of the sub - paths 0 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 , 0 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 0 - 1 , and 0 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 1 .",
    "this can be interpreted by a four - level model .",
    "in addition , as for interference between multi - photon transitions of even higher orders , the results of the four - level model also agree well with the full numerical calculations ( fig.1(a ) ) . this is because that the populations of higher states are so small under the present laser conditions that the additional sub - paths , including these higher states , are not important regardless of their larger transition dipole moments",

    "can equally be applied to analyze this case and the details will not be repeated here .",
    "in summary , we have investigated numerically the frequency dependence of the carrier - envelope phase effect on bound - bound transitions of helium in an ultrashort laser pulse .",
    "it has been found that the cep effect can occur regularly even at frequencies which are far off - resonance . to explain this numerical finding , we have examined a two - level model and developed a general and simple picture , where the total transition amplitude can be decomposed into different transition pathways .",
    "all these transition pathways can be characterized by two indices @xmath112 and @xmath74 , with @xmath112 being the number of photons involved and @xmath74 indicating where the resonance frequency is located . for a long laser pulse , each pathway",
    "is associated with a narrow peak at the resonance frequency @xmath62 and the pathways at the same resonance frequency have the same dependence on the cep . as a result , no interference can occur between different pathways and there is no cep effect .",
    "in contrast , for an ultrashort pulse , the peaks for pathways at different resonance frequencies can be broadened to cross with each other .",
    "therefore , interference between different pathways can happen and lead to strong cep effect .",
