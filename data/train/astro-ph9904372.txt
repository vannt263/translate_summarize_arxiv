    "the determination of the value of the hubble constant , @xmath0 , is one of the classical tasks of _ observational _ cosmology . in the framework of the expanding space paradigm it provides a measure of the distance scale in frw universes and its reciprocal gives the time scale .",
    "this problem has been approached in various ways .",
    "a review on the recent determinations of the value of @xmath0 shows that most methods provide values at @xmath8 ( for brevity we omit the units ; all @xmath0 values are in @xmath9 ) : virgo cluster yields @xmath10 and clusters from hubble diagram with relative distances to virgo @xmath11 ( federspiel et al .",

    "gouguenheim ( @xcite ) was the first to suggest that such a relation might exist as a distance indicator .",
    "bottinelli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) paid particular attention to the elimination of the so - called _",
    "malmquist bias_. in general terms , the determination of @xmath0 is subject to the malmquist bias of the @xmath23 kind : the inferred value of @xmath0 depends on the distribution of the derived distances @xmath24 for each true distance @xmath25 ( teerikorpi @xcite ) . consider the expectation value of the derived distance @xmath24 at a given true distance @xmath25 : @xmath26 the integral is done over _ derived _ distances @xmath24 .",
    "for example , consider a strict magnitude limit : for each true distance the derived distances are exposed to an upper cut - off .",
    "hence the expectation value for the derived distance @xmath24 at @xmath25 is too small and thus @xmath0 will be overestimated .",
    "observationally , the direct tully - fisher relation takes the form : @xmath27 where we have adopted a shorthand @xmath28 for @xmath3 and @xmath29 denotes either the absolute magnitude @xmath22 or @xmath30 , where @xmath31 labels the absolute linear size of a galaxy in kpc . in the _ direct _ approach",
    "the slope is determined from the linear regression of @xmath29 against @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting direct tully - fisher relation can be expressed as @xmath32 consider now the _ observed _ average of @xmath29 at each @xmath28 , @xmath33 , as a function of the true distance .",
    "the limit in @xmath34 ( the observational counterpart of @xmath29 ) cuts off progressively more and more of the distribution function of @xmath29 for a constant @xmath28 .",

    "the equality holds only when the @xmath34-limit cuts the luminosity function @xmath39 insignificantly .    that the direct relation is _ inevitably _ biased by its nature forces one either to look for an unbiased subsample or to find an appropriate correction for the bias .",

    "( @xcite ) could be confirmed by implementing the _ inverse _ tully - fisher relation : @xmath48 this problem has special importance because of the `` unbiased '' nature that has often been ascribed to the inverse tully - fisher relation as a distance indicator and because of the large number of galaxies available contrary to the direct approach where one is constrained to the so called unbiased plateau ( cf .",

    "it is hoped that this review clarifies the methodological basis of the klun project and also makes the notation used more familiar .",
    "the first step takes its simplest form by assuming the strictly linear hubble law : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the radial velocity inferred from the observed redshifts and @xmath51 is some input value for the hubble constant . because @xmath50 reflects the true kinematical distance @xmath52 via the true hubble constant @xmath53 @xmath54",

    "[ e7 ] sets up a _ relative _ distance scale : @xmath55 in other words , @xmath56 is known next to a constant .    in a more realistic case one",
    "ought to consider also the _ peculiar _ velocity field . in klun",
    "one assumes that peculiar velocities are governed mainly by the virgo supercluster .    in klun",
    "the kinematical distances are inferred from @xmath50 s by implementing the spherically symmetric model of peebles ( @xcite ) valid in the linear regime . in the adopted form of this model ( for the equations to be solved cf .",
    "e.g. bottinelli et al .",
    "@xcite , ekholm @xcite ) the centre of the peculiar velocity field is marked by the pair of giant ellipticals m86/87 positioned at some unknown true distance @xmath57 which is used to normalize the kinematical distance scale : the centre is at a distance @xmath58 .",
    "the required cosmological velocities @xmath59 ( observed velocities corrected for peculiar motions ) are calculated as @xmath60 where the constant @xmath61 defines the linear recession velocity of the centre of the system assumed to be at rest with respect to the quiescent hubble flow : @xmath62 @xmath63 is the presumed velocity of the centre and @xmath64 is the presumed infall velocity of the local group into the centre of the system .",

    "_ however , we should sample all @xmath3 for each constant _ true _ @xmath29 in the sample_. this theoretical prerequisition is often tacitly assumed in practice . for more formal treatments on the inverse relation cf .",

    "et97 demonstrated how under these ideal conditions the derived @xmath74 as a function of the kinematical distance should run horizontally as the adopted slope approaches the ideal , theoretical slope .    in practice",
    "the parameters involved are subject to uncertainties , in which case one should use instead of the unknown theoretical slope a slope which we call the _ relevant _ inverse slope .",
    "we would like to clarify in accurate terms the meaning of this slope which differs from the theoretical slope and which has been more heuristically discussed by teerikorpi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the difference between the theoretical and the relevant slope can be expressed in the following formal way .",
    "define the observed parameters as @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath29 is inferred from @xmath34 with a measurement error @xmath77 and the kinematical distance @xmath78 has an error @xmath79 due to uncertainties in the kinematical distance scale .",

[ e19 ] . note also that in the case of diameter relation , @xmath77 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are only weakly correlated .",

    "one might , by the face - value , be content with the slopes adopted as well as with the derived value of @xmath0 .",
    "the observed behaviour is what et97 argued to be the prerequisite for an unbiased estimate for the hubble constant : non - horizontal trends disappear .",

    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the inverse diameter relation predicts some 50 percent larger value and the magnitude relation some 30 percent larger value than the corresponding direct relations . in what follows",
    ", we try to understand this discrepancy .",
    "the first explanation coming to mind is that the apparently wellbehaving slope @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) is incorrect because of some selection effect and is thus _ not _ relevant in the sense discussed in sect .",
    "2.2 and in appendix a. the relevant slope brings about an unbiased estimate for the hubble parameter ( or the hubble constant if one possesses an ideal calibrator sample ) _ if _ the distribution function of @xmath3 , @xmath123 , is completely and correctly sampled for each @xmath29 .",

    "their analytical calculations given the gaussianity of @xmath123 show that this kind of selection effect has only a minuscule affect unless the cut - offs are considerable . because the selection does not seem to be significant , we do not expect much improvement in @xmath0 .",
    "there is , however , another effect which may alter the slope . as mentioned in sect .",
    "2.2 the type - dependence of the zero - point should be taken into account . because the selection function may depend on the morphological type it also affects the type corrections .",
    "this is clearly seen when one considers how the type corrections are actually calculated .",
    "as in theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) galaxies are shifted to a common hubble type 6 by applying a correction term @xmath124 to individual @xmath3 values , where @xmath125 different morphological types do not have identical spatial occupation , which is shown in fig .",

    "the inverse parameters @xmath126 and @xmath135 were used .",
    "it is seen that around @xmath136 the values of @xmath74 have a turning point as well as at @xmath137 .",
    "the most striking feature is  however  the general decreasing tendency of @xmath74 between these two points .",
    "now , according to et97 , a downward tendency of @xmath74 as a function of distance corresponds to @xmath138 , i.e. the adopted slope a is too shallow ( @xmath139 is the relevant slope ) .",
    "closer inspection of fig .  [ f1 ] shows that a steeper slope might provide a better fit to the calibrator sample .",
