    "it is well known that the essential physical properties of the copper oxide materials are described by the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model  @xcite .",

    "thus the constrained electron operators no longer obey the fermionic anti - commutation relations .",
    "the slave particle mean - field methods  @xcite were the first approaches to overcome this problem . in these methods ,",
    "the constrained electron operators are expressed in terms of auxiliary fermions and bosons . however , as the local single occupancy constraints are replaced by an average global constraint , these mean - field methods lead to considerable errors : for example , the antiferromagnetic long - range order is overestimated  @xcite .",
    "another approach  @xcite is to express the constrained electron operators in terms of spinless fermions and spin-@xmath6 operators by introducing pseudospins state associated with empty sites . using this representation ,",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian can be described without any constraint in contrast with the slave particle methods .",
    "the spin-``up '' and spin-``down '' symmetry ( time - reversal symmetry ) of this representation is discussed by wang and rice  @xcite and loos  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we develop this idea and calculate the critical doping @xmath7 , where the antiferromagnetic long - range order disappears .",
    "our representation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model corresponds to the _ isotropic _ antiferromagnetic heisenberg model in an effective magnetic field within a mean - field approximation . in order to calculate the staggered magnetization of the model",
    ", we employ the many - body green s function method developed by frbrich and kuntz  @xcite . unlike the slave particle methods ,",
    "we show that the critical doping @xmath7 for the disappearance of antiferromagnetic long - range order is in good agreement with the numerical calculations@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ 2 ] , we introduce a transformation mapping the original hilbert space of the constrained electrons to the tensor - product space of the spinless fermion and spin states .",
    "we also discuss the difference between our method and the preceding methods  @xcite . in sec .  [ 3 ] , using the many - body green s function method , we calculate the staggered magnetization of the model obtained in sec .  [ 2 ] within a mean - field approximation .",

    "the electron in this model is subjected to the constraint of no double occupancy , _",

    "the constrained electron operators @xmath9 act on this basis as @xmath18      one of the most popular techniques to handle the single occupancy constraint  ( [ constraint ] ) is the slave particle method  @xcite . in the slave boson representation ,",
    "the constrained electron operators are given by the mapping @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the bosonic operator annihilating the empty state and @xmath21 is the fermionic operator annihilating the single occupied state .",
    "in this case , the non - holonomic constraint  ( [ constraint ] ) is replaced by the holonomic constraint @xmath22 . for practical purposes , however , these local constraints for each site are almost inevitably replaced by an average global constraint ,",
    "resulting in errors : one of the most serious drawbacks is that the antiferromagnetic long - range order is overestimated  @xcite .    in this paper",
