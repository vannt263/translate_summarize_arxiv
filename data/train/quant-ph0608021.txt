    "we provide a theoretical description of the intensity pattern in double - slit experiments with neutrons , with specific attention to the _ cold _ neutron diffraction ( @xmath0 ) carried out by zeilinger _",
    "et al_.  in 1988  @xcite .",
    "the result we obtain is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fit ] .    usually , the main problem in the analysis of diffraction experiments is to establish exactly which causes bring about the reduced coherence experimentally inferred from the detected signal .",
    "this effect can be produced both by the initial preparation of the beam ( namely , the non - dynamical _ incoherence _ ) and by the interaction of its constituting particles with the environment ( namely , the dynamical _ decoherence _ )  @xcite .",
    "we find that in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite decoherence does not play any role in the fringe visibility reduction , which indeed is entirely due to incoherence of the source .",
    "this conclusion is opposite to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is claimed that decoherence is essential for explaining the data from  @xcite .",
    "we provide calculations and numerical simulations in support of an unexpected incoherence cause , which we propose plays a role in explaining the experimental data of ref .",
    "this cause is that the width of the wave function impinging on the double - slit is comparable with the size of the double - slit setup ( i.e. , the distance between the two slits and the slit apertures ) .",
    "we argue that this feature of the incoming wave function leads to a slight difference in transverse momentum between the two wave packets emanating from the grating , such that the centers of the packets move apart .",
    "this momentum difference was already suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , but no physical explanation was given .",
    "it proves relevant for fitting the data of ref .",
    "@xcite . even though it does not reduce the fringe visibility",
    ", it can significantly affect the shape of the interference pattern , changing the overlap of the two packets and so the position of secondary minima and maxima .",
    "we now describe the various causes of reduced coherence which can occur within neutron interferometry .",
    "let the @xmath1 direction be the direction of propagation of the beam .",
    "we assume that the grating is translation invariant in the @xmath2 direction , and that the motion in the @xmath1 direction is essentially classical , so that the problem reduces to one dimension , corresponding to the @xmath3 axis .      in the initial preparation of a beam , it is problematic to keep a perfect control on the _ monochromaticity _ and on the _ collimation _ of the beam .    concerning the non - monochromaticity , every spectral component of the beam contributes incoherently to every other . in our case , assuming that the detection screen is parallel to the @xmath3 axis , the intensity observed on the screen at coordinate @xmath3 is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the wavelength distribution of the beam and @xmath6 the intensity corresponding to a single wavelength @xmath7 .",
    "thus , one can continue the analysis with a single wavelength and postpone the integration to the final step ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : measured ] ) .",
    "concerning the collimation of the beam , a relevant cause of incoherence is that the particle source emits _ random wave functions _ , whose randomness lies in the deviation of its direction of propagation from the @xmath1 direction , corresponding to imperfect collimation .",
    "this cause of incoherence will be taken into account in our model of the beam by means of a random wave vector @xmath8 .      in the treatment of decoherence",
    ", we make explicit use of the fact that we are concerned with neutrons , in particular at the low energies of ref .  @xcite . in this case , in fact , the only relevant decoherence channel  if any  consists in collisions with air molecules , so that the dynamics can be modelled within a markovian description of the scattering event , in particular in the _ large scale _ approximation allowed by air molecules ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the model obtained in this way allows an estimate of the neutron _ coherence time _",
    "@xmath9  @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the environmental pressure at the temperature @xmath12 , @xmath13 the total cross section of the scattering events , @xmath14 the boltzmann constant and @xmath15 the mean mass of air molecules .",
    "( eq .   takes into account a correction by a factor @xmath16 , usually missing in the literature , that was theoretically predicted in  @xcite and experimentally checked in  @xcite . )",
    "the result is that @xmath17 is much greater than the time of flight , even in extreme experimental situations .",
    "in fact , even considering a surrounding pressure of @xmath18 ( though typically ",
    "the beam paths along the optical bench \" are  evacuated in order to minimize absorption and scattering \"  @xcite ) and room temperature , for an estimated total cross section of @xmath19 under the considered conditions for the molecules which compose the air are not reported in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , starting from related measurements  @xcite and using typical trends of the cross section , it is possible to estimate very roughly the bound @xmath20 . however , even if a correct estimation of @xmath13 led to a greater value , @xmath21 would still be much larger than the time of flight @xmath22 since five orders of magnitude lie between our estimate for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed very unfavorable experimental circumstances .",
    "] we obtain that @xmath23 . this time  not much smaller than the neutron lifetime",
    " shows that the coherence is fully kept for the duration of most experiments .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite the mean time of flight is @xmath24 , several orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath17 .    for this reason , in the following we shall regard the neutron beam as uncoupled from its environment and shall describe the dynamics through the usual unitary schrdinger evolution .",
    "this conclusion contradicts that of sanz _ et al . _  in ref .",
    "@xcite , who claim that  decoherence is likely to exist in zeilinger _",
    "et al . _ s experiment . \"",
    "indeed , their own calculations do not support their conclusion .",
    "the basis of their claim is that the _ damping term _",
    "@xmath25 in their expression for the observed intensity pattern [ see their eq .",
    "( 27 ) ] turns out , when fitted to the data , to be nonzero .",
    "however , this term could just as well represent _ incoherence _ instead of decoherence ( as does for example the similar quantity @xmath26 in their eq .",
    "( 16 ) , or the _ coherence length _ in eq .",
    "( 47 ) of ref .",
    "indeed , our estimate of the coherence time shows that the damping @xmath25 can not be attributed to decoherence .",
    "in order to obtain a theoretical description of the intensity pattern measured in the experiment , we precisely describe the whole evolution of the neutron beam , from its production to the arrival on the detection screen .",
    "we set up a concrete model for what the wave functions of the neutrons in the beam look like , and thus obtain the density matrix and the intensity pattern .",
    "( another approach @xcite is to guess the density matrix from information theoretic principles , but we prefer to avoid the invocation of such principles . )    the width @xmath27 of the _ entrance _ slit fixes the spatial extension of the ( random ) wave packets .",
    "the wave packets @xmath28 produced by the source are modeled , when passing the entrance slit , as gaussian wave packets with mean @xmath29 and standard deviation @xmath30 , i.e. , the standard deviation of the _ uniform _ probability distribution over the interval of length @xmath27 .",
    "thus , @xmath31 where we take the random wave number @xmath8 to have a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation @xmath32 . as established in sec .",

[",
    "sec : model ] we shall present two different models for the wave function immediately after the grating ( the _ outgoing _ wave function @xmath38 ) as a function of the incoming wave function @xmath39 .    we now consider the free propagation of the outgoing state @xmath38 toward the screen .",
    "we obtain the density matrix @xmath40 by averaging @xmath41 with respect to the probability distribution of the wave number @xmath8 . the intensity measured on the _ distant _ screen is proportional to the diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath42 at the _ time of arrival _ @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 the mass of the neutron)as already stated and well motivated in the literature  @xcite : @xmath45 . before identifying it with the measured intensity , we have also to consider the integration   over the wavelength and the finite spatial resolution @xmath46 of the detector . for the latter",
    ", we shall consider _ flat response _ on the interval @xmath47 $ ] around each position @xmath3 , so that the intensity is finally given by @xmath48 where @xmath46 and @xmath49 are directly adoptable from ref .",
    "we describe two models for the passage of the neutron through the grating .",
    "the first is a simplified model , which can be treated analytically and features the momentum difference between the two transmitted packets in the transverse @xmath3 direction .",
    "the second , on which fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] is based , is more flexible and achieves better agreement with experimental data .",
    "the central assumption of this model is that the outgoing wave function is of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a complex function whose modulus is @xmath52 and signifies the degree of transmission , while the phase signifies the phase shift during the passage through the grating .",
    "the simplest model assumption would be to set @xmath53 for @xmath54 \\cup [ x_2-a_2/2 , x_2 + a_2/2]$ ] and @xmath55 otherwise , where the two intervals represent the two slits , their apertures @xmath56 , @xmath57 and distance @xmath58 are known @xcite , and @xmath59 for @xmath60 is the center of the @xmath61-th slit . with this choice of @xmath51 ,",
    "the multiplication by @xmath51 is a projection operator .",
    "however , to enable analytical computations we find it more useful to set @xmath62 + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_2 } \\exp\\big[-\\frac{(x - x_2)^2}{2\\sigma_2 ^ 2}\\bigg],\\ ] ] where @xmath63 .",
    "now @xmath6 can be calculated exactly . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit2 ] the comparison between the theoretical intensity which follows from this model and the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite is shown .",
    "apart from a constant background subtracted from experimental data , there is only one fit parameter @xmath32 , for which we have found @xmath64 .",
    "this value corresponds to a @xmath65velocity with standard deviation equal to @xmath66 , while the mean @xmath67velocity distribution is @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to look at the explicit formula for the outgoing wave function . for simplicity , set @xmath69 .",

    "therefore @xmath38 is the sum of two gaussian packets with momentum in the @xmath3 direction equal to @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath77 and @xmath78 have opposite signs , the same holds for @xmath79 and @xmath80 and , consequently , for @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in other words ,",
    "the packets produced by the grating have two opposite momenta in the transverse direction , as a consequence of the finite width of the neutron wave function compared to the scale fixed by the grating size .",
    "( note that if @xmath39 is very spread out , i.e. , if @xmath81 is large , then @xmath82 is small ) .",
    "also in the presence of a common drift expressed by @xmath8 , the packets produced by the grating have wave number in the transverse direction equal to @xmath83 and @xmath84 , with analytical expressions for the wave functions and @xmath85 more complicated than before .    even though the agreement with experimental data is not completely satisfactory , this model illustrates the origin of the transverse momenta @xmath75 and @xmath76 that , as already noticed by sanz _",
