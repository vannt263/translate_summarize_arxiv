    "it is a natural problem to determine whether one curve can be deformed into the other while keeping end - directions fixed and respecting the curvature bounds . from another viewpoint",
    ", one is asking for a characterization of the connected components of the space of all such curves .",
    "more ambitiously , what is its homotopy or homeomorphism type ?",
    "the answer can be unexpectedly interesting , and it is closely linked to the geometry of @xmath0 .    in this article",
    "this question is investigated when @xmath0 is hyperbolic , that is , a ( possibly nonorientable ) smooth surface endowed with a complete riemannian metric of constant negative curvature , say @xmath3 .",
    "it is well known that any such surface can be expressed as the quotient of the hyperbolic plane @xmath4 by a discrete group of isometries .",
    "thus any curve on @xmath0 can be lifted to a curve in @xmath5 having the same curvature ( at least in absolute value , if @xmath0 is nonorientable ) . as will be explained more carefully later ,",
    "this implies that one can obtain a solution of the problem about spaces of curves on @xmath0 if one knows how to solve the corresponding problem in the hyperbolic plane for all pairs of directions .",
    "let @xmath6 ( the unit tangent bundle of @xmath5 ) be two such directions .",
    "let @xmath7 be the set of all smooth regular curves on @xmath5 whose initial ( resp .",
    "final ) unit tangent vectors equal @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 ) and whose curvatures take values inside @xmath10 , furnished with the @xmath11-topology .",
    "there are canonical candidates for the position of connected component of this space , defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the universal cover .",
    "fixing a lift @xmath13 of @xmath8 , one obtains a map @xmath14 by looking at the endpoint of the lift to the universal cover , starting at @xmath13 , of curves in @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath16 is discrete , this yields a decomposition of the former into closed - open subspaces .    more concretely ,",
    "let @xmath17 \\to \\c $ ] be a regular plane curve .",
    "an @xmath18 \\to \\r $ ] for @xmath19 is a continuous function such that @xmath20 always points in the direction of @xmath21 ; note that there are countably many such functions , which differ by multiples of @xmath22 .",
    "the of @xmath19 is defined as @xmath23 .",
    "because @xmath5 is diffeomorphic to @xmath24 , any regular curve in the former also admits arguments and a total turning .",
    "however , these have no geometric meaning since they depend on the chosen diffeomorphism . in any case , once such a choice has been made , it gives rise to the decomposition @xmath25 where @xmath26 consists of those curves in @xmath15 which have total turning @xmath27 , and @xmath27 runs over all total turnings , viz .",
    ", those for which @xmath9 is parallel to @xmath28 ( regarded as vectors in @xmath24 ) . the closed - open subspaces appearing on the right side of , which will be referred to as the of @xmath29 , are independent of the diffeomorphism : they are in bijective correspondence with the fiber @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath30 and @xmath31 , so that no restriction is imposed on the curvature , then they are in fact precisely the components of @xmath7 , and each of them is contractible . however , for general curvature bounds they may fail to be connected , contractible , or even nonempty .",
    "the possibilities depend above all upon the relation of @xmath1 to the interval @xmath2 $ ] .",

    "this subspace is always contractible .",

    "the latter are all contractible .",
    "if @xmath1 contains @xmath2 $ ] , then none of the canonical subspaces is empty .",
    "we conjecture that most are contractible , but finitely many of them may have the homotopy type of an @xmath32-sphere , for some @xmath33 depending upon the subspace .",
    "this conjecture is partly motivated by results about the corresponding spaces of curves in the euclidean plane obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , if @xmath1 overlaps @xmath2 $ ] , then infinitely many of the canonical subspaces are empty , and infinitely many are nonempty .",
    "nevertheless , as in the previous case , these subspaces may not be connected .",
    "we do not venture a guess at their homotopy type .",
    "after briefly introducing some notation and definitions ,  [",
    "s : basic ] begins with a discussion of curves of constant curvature @xmath34 in the hyperbolic plane : circles ( @xmath35 ) , horocycles ( @xmath36 ) and elcrics ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "then a transformation is defined which takes a curve and shifts it by a fixed distance along the direction prescribed by its normal unit vectors .",
    "its effect on the regularity and curvature of the original curve is investigated , and applied to reduce the dependence of the topology of @xmath7 to four real parameters , instead of the eight needed to specify @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in ",
    "[ s : voidness ] the voidness of the canonical subspaces is discussed .",
    "it is proven that if @xmath1 is contained in @xmath2 $ ] , then the image of any curve in @xmath7 is the graph of a function when seen in an appropriate conformal model of the hyperbolic plane , which we call the mercator model . in particular , at most one of its canonical subspaces is nonempty .",
    "if @xmath1 contains @xmath40 $ ] , then none of the canonical subspaces is empty . in the two remaining cases",
    ", there is a critical value @xmath41 for the total turning such that @xmath42 is nonempty for all @xmath43 and empty for all @xmath44 ( or the reverse , depending on whether @xmath10 contains points to the right or left of @xmath2 $ ] ) .",
    "section [ s : frame ] explains how a curve of constrained curvature may also be regarded as a curve in the group of orientation - preserving isometries of @xmath45 satisfying certain conditions .",
    "this perspective is sometimes useful .    in  [",
    "s : disjoint ] it is shown that the nonempty canonical subspaces of @xmath7 are all contractible when @xmath1 is disjoint from @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the idea is to parametrize all curves in such a subspace by the argument of its unit tangent vector when viewed as a curve in the half - plane model , and to take ( euclidean ) convex combinations .",
    "the proof intertwines various euclidean and hyperbolic concepts , and seems to be highly dependent on this particular model .    in the mercator model @xmath46 , vertical translations are isometries .",
    "because any curve in @xmath7 may be parametrized as @xmath47 when @xmath1 is contained in @xmath2 $ ] , the bounds on its curvature can be translated into two differential inequalities involving @xmath48 and @xmath49 , but not @xmath50 itself .",

    "[ s : contained ] .",
    "in  [ s : general ] we define spaces of curves with constrained curvature on a general surface @xmath0 , not necessarily hyperbolic nor orientable .",
    "it is shown that if @xmath0 is compact then any such space is nonempty ; this is also true in the euclidean plane , but not in the hyperbolic plane , as mentioned previously .",
    "moreover , riemannian coverings of @xmath0 induce homeomorphisms between spaces of curves on @xmath0 and on the covering space .",
    "the section ends with a brief discussion of spaces of closed curves without basepoint conditions .",
    "several useful constructions , notably one which is essential to the proof of the main result of  [ s : contained ] , may create discontinuities of the curvature , and thus lead out of the class of spaces @xmath52 defined in ",
    "[ s : general ] . to circumvent this ,",
    "the paraphernalia of @xmath53 functions is used in  [ s : discontinuous ] to define another family of spaces , denoted @xmath54 , which are hilbert manifolds .",
    "the curves in these spaces are regular but their curvatures are only defined almost everywhere . the main result of  [ s : discontinuous ] states that the natural inclusion @xmath55 is a homotopy equivalence with dense image . sections [ s : general ] and [ s : discontinuous ] are independent of the other ones .    in this article",
    "many auxiliary results are stated as exercises .",
    "most of these are straightforward computations or else become trivial once the situation is visualized in the appropriate model .",
    "the more difficult and important ones are accompanied by `` hints '' , sometimes amounting to full sketches of a solution ; these are collected in  [ s : hints ] .",
    "the bibliographies of @xcite and @xcite contain more references to works on related problems .",
    "it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the geometry of the hyperbolic plane as discussed , for instance , in chapter 2 of @xcite , the expository article @xcite , chapter 7 of @xcite or chapters 35 of @xcite .",
