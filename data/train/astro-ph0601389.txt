    "observational evidence for accelerated expansion in the universe has been growing in the last two decades @xcite .",
    "independent confirmation using observations of high redshift supernovae @xcite has made this result more acceptable to the community . using these observations along with observations of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structure @xcite , we can construct a `` concordance '' model for cosmology and study variations around it ( e.g. , see @xcite ; for an overview of our current understanding , see @xcite ) .",
    "observations indicate that the dominant component of energy density  called dark energy  should have an equation of state parameter @xmath2 for the universe to undergo accelerated expansion . indeed",
    ", present day observations require @xmath1 .",
    "the cosmological constant is the simplest explanation for accelerated expansion and it is known to be consistent with observations . in order to avoid theoretical problems related to cosmological constant",
    ", many other scenarios have been investigated : these include quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyon field @xcite , chaplygin gas and its generalisations @xcite , phantom fields @xcite , branes @xcite and many others @xcite in these models one can have @xmath3 and in general @xmath4 varies with redshift . for references to papers that discuss specific models ,",
    "the reader may consult one of the many reviews @xcite . even though these models have been proposed to overcome the fine tuning problem for cosmological constant , most models require similar fine tuning of parameter(s ) to be consistent with observations .",
    "nevertheless , they raise the possibility of @xmath5 evolving with time ( or it being different from @xmath6 ) , which can be tested by observations .",
    "given that @xmath4 for dark energy should be smaller than @xmath7 for the universe to undergo accelerated expansion , the energy density of this component changes at a much slower rate than that of matter and radiation .",
    "( indeed , @xmath8 for cosmological constant and in this case the energy density is a constant . )",
    "unless @xmath4 is a rapidly varying function of redshift and becomes @xmath9 at ( @xmath10 ) , the energy density of dark energy should be negligible at high redshifts ( @xmath11 ) compared to that of non - relativistic matter .",
    "if dark energy evolves in a manner such that its energy density is comparable to , or greater than the matter density in the universe at high redshifts then the basic structure of the cosmological model needs to be modified .",
    "we do not consider such models , instead we confine our attention to constraints on dark energy in realistic models and choose observations which are sensitive to evolution of @xmath5 at redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "supernova observations permit a large variation in the equation of state @xcite .",
    "it has recently been argued that a cosmological constant with a small curvature can be interpreted as a dynamical dark energy model @xcite .",
    "we have shown that a combination of supernova observations with cmb observations and abundance of rich clusters of galaxies provides tight constraints on variation of dark energy @xcite . of these cmb data",
    "provides the most stringent bounds on the allowed variation in evolution of dark energy density . in this paper",
    "the main motivation is to study how these models fare in the light of current cmb data @xcite .",
    "a variety of observations can be used to constrain models of dark energy , e.g. see ",
    "ii  b of @xcite for an overview .",
    "observations of high redshift supernovae provided the first direct evidence for accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "this , coupled with the ease with which the high redshift supernova data can be compared with cosmological models has made it the favourite benchmark for comparison with models of dark energy .",
    "it is often considered sufficient to compare a model with the supernova data even though observers and theorists have pointed out potential problems with the data @xcite as well as some peculiar implications of the data @xcite .",
    "further , it has been shown that other observations like temperature anisotropies in the cmb fix the distance to the last scattering surface and are a reliable probe of dark energy @xcite . in this work",
    ", we try to understand the origin of the constraint on models of dark energy from cmb anisotropy observations .",
    "we show that the angular scale of acoustic peaks provides the leading constraint on the combination of parameters .",
    "an additional constraint comes in through the degeneracy with @xmath0 , where a constraint on @xmath0 from the relative heights of acoustic peaks translates into an indirect constraint on the equation of state parameter @xmath4 .    in an earlier work",
    ", we compared the constraints on models of dark energy from supernova and cmb observations and pointed out that models preferred by these observations lie in distinct parts of the parameter space and there is no overlap of regions allowed at @xmath13 confidence level @xcite .",
    "even though different observational sets are sensitive to different combinations of cosmological parameters , we do not expect models favoured by one observation to be ruled out by another when such a divergence is not expected .",
    "this divergence may point to some shortcomings in the model , or to systematic errors in observations , or even to an incorrect choice of priors .",
    "we suggested that this may indicate unresolved systematic errors in one of the observations , with supernova observations being more likely to suffer from this problem due to the heterogeneous nature of the data sets available at the time . in supernova legacy survey ( snls )",
    "@xcite survey , a concerted effort has been made to reduce systematic errors by using only high quality observations .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are reduced by using a single instrument to observe the fields . using a rolling search technique",
    "ensures that sources are not lost and data is of superior quality ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "if our claim about gold+silver data set were to be true , snls data should not be at variance with the wmap data in this work we study constraints on dark energy models from high redshift supernova observations from the snls survey and also observations of the temperature and polarisation anisotropies in the cmb using the wmap5 data .",
    "this paper is a revised version of an earlier manuscript which became out of date after wmap-3 and then wmap-5 data were released . in the interim period ,",
    "the issue of systematics in inhomogeneous data sets has been accepted , therefore we do not emphasize that aspect much in this version .",
    "the focus of the current paper is twofold : to study constraints on dark energy models in light of the snls and wmap-5 data , and , to understand the combination of cosmological parameters that is constrained by the cmb observations .",
    "if we assume that each of the constituents of the homogeneous and isotropic universe can be considered to be an ideal fluid , and that the space is flat , the friedman equations can be written as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the pressure and @xmath16 with the respective terms denoting energy densities for nonrelativistic matter , for radiation / relativistic matter and for dark energy .",
    "pressure is zero for the non - relativistic component , whereas radiation and relativistic matter have @xmath17 .",
    "if the cosmological constant is the source of acceleration then @xmath18  constant and @xmath19 .",
    "analysis of nonflat cosmologies reveals that allowed range of curvature of the universe @xmath20 is @xmath21 at 95% confidence level and a flat universe is a good fit to the current data @xcite .",
    "an obvious generalisation is to consider models with a constant equation of state parameter @xmath22  _ constant_. one can , in fact , further generalise to models with a varying equation of state parameter @xmath5 .",
    "since a function is equivalent to an infinite set of numbers ( defined e.g. by a taylor - laurent series coefficients ) , it is clearly not possible to constrain the form of an arbitrary function @xmath5 using a finite number of observations .",
    "one possible way of circumventing this issue is to parameterise the function @xmath5 by a finite number of parameters and try to constrain these parameters with the available observational data .",
    "there have been many attempts to describe varying dark energy with different parameterisations @xcite where the functional form of @xmath5 is fixed and the variation is described with a small number of parameters .",
    "observational constraints depend on the specific parameterisation chosen , but it should be possible to glean some parameterisation independent results from the analysis .    to model varying dark energy we use two parameterisations @xmath23 these",
    "are chosen so that , among other things , the high redshift behaviour is completely different in these two parameterisations @xcite . if @xmath24 , the asymptotic value @xmath25 and for @xmath26 , @xmath27 . for both @xmath28 , the present value @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , we must have @xmath30 for the standard cosmological models with a hot big bang to be valid .",
    "this restriction is imposed over and above the priors used in our study .",
    "the allowed range of parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 is likely to be different for different @xmath33 .",
    "however , the allowed variation at low redshifts in @xmath34 should be similar in both models as observations actually probe the variation of dark energy density .     and @xmath35 mpc.,width=211 ]    .,width=211 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we studied constraints on models of varying dark energy with the snls and wmap5 data and the results",
    "are summarised in table  2 , which gives the ranges of parameters allowed at @xmath36 confidence level .",
    "the supernova data constrains @xmath31 but does not effectively constrain @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "cmb data constrains an effective equation of state and hence indirectly provides constraints on @xmath38 .",
    "this is evident from lower panels of figure  5 , where we have plotted confidence contours in @xmath39 plane .",
    "the cmb contours are significantly narrower than those given by the supernova data",
    ". we do not find any significant changes in the likelihood contours for other parameters such as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "for instance the range of @xmath41 is given by @xmath44 is valid for all the models considered here .",
    "this is illustrated in table  2 .",
    "given that cmb observations constrain only one number , we expect that the constraint on models with varying @xmath5 should constrain only @xmath45 as defined in eqn.([eqn : weff ] ) .",
    "we confirm this by plotting likelihood contours for models with varying @xmath5 on the @xmath46 plane .",
    "we also plot contours for constant @xmath4 models on the same plane for reference .",
    "figure  6 shows these contours for the models with @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "we find very strong coincidence in the contours for models with variable @xmath5 when plotted with @xmath45 with the contours for models with constant @xmath4 thereby confirming our conjecture .",
    "this also provides an easy approach to constraining models with variable @xmath5 without detailed calculations , all that one needs is to check whether @xmath45 is in the range allowed by cmb observations for @xmath4 in the constant @xmath4 model .",
    "we return to the issue of variation of dark energy density allowed by observations .",
    "a pictorial representation of results is given in figure  7 , where we have plotted @xmath47 as a function of redshift .",
    "different panels show the evolution of this quantity as allowed by the snls data set , wmap5 observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies in the cmb and combined constraints from wmap5+snls .",
    "these are plotted for constant @xmath4 ( with and without dark energy perturbations ) , and for variable @xmath4 with @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "dark energy was assumed to be homogeneous in all cases except for the second row that corresponds to constant @xmath4 models with perturbations in dark energy .",
    "we can conclude that :    * supernova observations are a tight constraint for models with constant @xmath4 , but these are not as strong as cmb constraints .",
    "* snls+wmap5 data offers tighter constraints than either data set and the cosmological constant is allowed with a high probability .",
    "this follows from the complementary nature of the two constraints as seen from the orientation of the likelihood contours ( e.g. , see figure  5 ) .",
    "* supernova observations do not constrain evolution of dark energy density in models with a variable @xmath4 . very large variation in dark energy density",
    "is allowed by these observations . *",
    "wmap5 observations are , in contrast , a much tighter constraint and do not allow significant variation in dark energy .",
    "indeed , the variation in dark energy density allowed by wmap5 observations for models with variable @xmath4 is not significantly larger than that allowed for constant @xmath4 models . *",
    "we demonstrate that the constraints on dark energy parameters for varying @xmath4 models are the same as the constraints on constant @xmath4 models if we consider @xmath45 for varying dark energy models .",
    "* snls+wmap constraints are essentially dominated by the wmap data and follow the same pattern .",
    "snls observations add to the overall constraint by limiting the range of values allowed for @xmath31 .",
    "we would like to add a note of caution that the analysis for varying @xmath4 models does not take perturbations in dark energy into account .",
    "however , these are more important for @xmath48 or models with rapidly varying @xmath4 @xcite and such models are not allowed by observational constraints .",
    "in this work we studied the snls data set and compared the constraints obtained with constraints from wmap five year data on temperature anisotropies in the cmb . we find that the parameter values favoured by the two data sets have significant overlap and the two sets can be combined to put tight constraints on models of dark energy . in an earlier work",
    "we had noted that the gold+silver data set does not agree with wmap observations in that these favour distinct parts of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "constraints from wmap and structure formation favour similar models , but ones distinct from those favoured by gold+silver supernova observations .",
    "this indicates some degree of inconsistency between the supernova and other observations and it led us to suggest that the gold+silver data set may be affected by as yet unknown systematic errors @xcite .",
    "one reason for doubting the supernova data is the heterogeneity of sources from which the particular data set was collected @xcite .",
    "snls @xcite is a homogeneous data set and should not suffer from such problems and indeed we find that there is no inconsistency between snls and wmap observations .",
    "this highlights the usefulness of cmb observations for constraining models of dark energy @xcite .",
    "we believe that cmb observations should be used for testing any model of dark energy as supernova observations do not constrain models with varying @xmath4 effectively .",
    "models is from the cmb data ] thus one should use cmb observations as well and not rely only on supernova observations for constraining such models .",
    "we would like to add a note of caution against combining the snls data with other data sets of high redshift supernovae in light of the very different nature of these data sets .",
    "indeed , one should use homogeneous data sets like the snls in isolation to avoid the problems mentioned above .    in terms of models ,",
    "we find that the cosmological constant is favoured by individual observations ( snls and wmap ) as well as in the combined data set with very high probability . table  2 gives allowed values of all cosmological parameters at @xmath36 confidence level by snls , wmap as well as the combined data set .",
    "for the cases where a similar analysis has been done by others , our results are consistent with other findings .",
    "we have discussed the origin of the constraint on dark energy models from cmb observations at length .",
    "we may conclude from the analysis presented here that :    * location of acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies is the main source of constraints .",
    "* cmb observations only constrain @xmath45 , an effective value of the equation of state parameter defined in eqn.([eqn : weff ] ) .",
    "this can be used to translate constraints on models with constant @xmath4 to models where dark energy properties vary with time .",
    "* we have discussed models with @xmath49 in this paper . in case",
    "this constraint is relaxed then the well known degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath50 loosens the constraints .",
    "however , it is well known that the sn and cmb data are complementary and can be combined to provide fairly tight constraints even in this case @xcite .",
    "we do not expect variations in curvature to modify our conclusions about @xmath45 being the only dark energy related quantity constrained by cmb observations . *",
    "integrate sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect due to perturbations in dark energy can , in principle , lead to variations in the cmbr angular power slectrum at small @xmath51 . our analysis of models with variable @xmath4 without perturbations does not take this into account .",
    "various analyses have shown that isw does not contribute significantly to constraining cosmological parameters from cmb data ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason for this is that isw affects power at small @xmath51 , and due to large cosmic variance these modes do not contribute much to the overall likelihood .",
    "numerical work for this study was carried out at cluster computing facility in the harish - chandra research institute ( http://cluster.hri.res.in ) .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system ."
