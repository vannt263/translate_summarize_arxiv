    "experiments with cold atoms have disclosed a new way of investigating strongly correlated systems @xcite . the possibility to cool down both fermionic and bosonic atomic gases to very low temperature and to trap them onto optical lattices ,",
    "together with the ability to tune the interactions and the dimensionality with high accuracy , has allowed to simulate a great variety of interacting many - body lattice hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "particular theoretical efforts have been devoted to identifying fermionic hubbard - like systems @xcite which ground state exhibits exotic @xcite and topological phases @xcite , described by string - like order parameters @xcite .",
    "also particles with dipolar long range interaction like polar molecules and magnetic atoms @xcite are currently available in laboratories .",
    "this has allowed for the experimental realization of a paradigmatic model in condensed matter physics namely the extended bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , bosonization @xcite is a well - established analytical technique to investigate the low energy regime of one dimensional interacting fermionic systems .",
    "it consists in linearizing the spectrum around the fermi points , passing to the continuum limit , and finally expressing the fermionic operators in terms of bosonic fields . in this way one has an efficient and general setting to study the low energy excitations induced by different types of interaction . despite the fact that in most cases further numerical analyses are needed in order to get the full zero temperature phase diagram",
    ", bosonization is very useful to understand the nature of many quantum phases of matter and evaluate the correlation functions which characterize them . + within bosonization approach ,",
    "usually the interaction is included in a perturbative way , starting from two non - interacting single component luttinger liquids ( lls ) .",
    "in fact , as noticed in @xcite , in some cases part of the interaction can be included non - perturbatively already in the single component hamiltonian , as long as it remains in a ll regime .",
    "this possibility has been exploited for instance in @xcite to predict the presence of a bond ordered wave ( bow ) phase induced by dipolar interaction already within one - loop bosonization .",
    "here we adopt it to derive the zero temperature phase diagram of a one dimensional hubbard model in presence of correlated hopping  induced by a periodical modulation of the on - site interaction @xcite , as recently shown experimentally @xcite and long - range dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the model and rewrite the hamiltonian in normal ordered form . in section 3",
    "we review its bosonization phase diagram , which coincides with that of two spin - charge decoupled sine- gordon models , due to the peculiar @xmath0 nature of the power law decay of the dipolar interaction .",
    "the different gapped and partly gapped phases are characterized in terms of string and parity @xcite non - local orders . in section 4",
    "we then revisit the phase diagram by including part of both dipolar and correlated hopping interaction non perturbatively in the single component hamiltonians . in this case , the phase diagram obtained from the study of renormalization group ( rg ) flow equations exhibit a richer structure . in section 5",
    "we give some conclusions .",
    "we consider a balanced unit density two - component dipolar fermi mixture .",
    "once these particles are trapped in a one dimensional lattice , an accurate description of the system is given by the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath1 + u_0\\sum_j n_{j,\\uparrow}n_{j,\\downarrow}+v\\sum_{j , r>0}\\frac { n_j n_{j+r}}{r^3}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 ; @xmath3 is the index species and @xmath4 denotes its opposite , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , @xmath7 counts the number of particles of species @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the coupling coefficients @xmath10 , independently tunable in the experiments @xcite , describe the tunneling probability , on - site and dipolar interactions , and correlated hopping processes , respectively . upon normal ordering of the operators , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , and omitting the constant terms , we get @xmath15 where we have set @xmath16 and have defined @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "in the standard bosonization approach , one starts from the non - interacting hamiltonian and consider the effect of interactions in a perturbative manner . the first step is to perform the continuum limit : @xmath19 ; @xmath20 $ ] ( with @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the lattice constant ) . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the fermionic field operators for the right and left movers , respectively . as claimed before , we will consider the particular case in which the system is at half filling ; hence @xmath25 .",
    "we finally write the fermionic fields @xmath26 in terms of the bosonic ones @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29}\\ ] ] where the generic index @xmath30 can denote right ( r ) or left ( l ) movers , with the usual convention that it assumes a positive sign in the first case and a negative sign in the second one . here",
    "@xmath31 is an ultraviolet cutoff and @xmath32 are the klein factors , which guarantee proper anti - commutation relations . with this notation ,",
    "the kinetic operator @xmath33 and the density operator @xmath34 appearing in hamiltonian ( [ hamnormord ] ) have the following expressions in terms of the bosonic fields @xmath35+ ... \\ ] ] @xmath36+ ... \\ ] ] here we have used dots to denote the higher order terms in expansion with respect to @xmath37 , which will be neglected .",
    "bosonization of two and three body - terms in the hamiltonian ( [ hamnormord ] ) involves calculating the product of operators of the form ( [ : q : ] ) and ( [ : n : ] ) .",
    "when the latters act on different fermionic species , the calculation is straightforward .",
    "when acting on the same species instead , the operator product expansion is needed . in deriving the bosonized expression for @xmath38 ,",
    "we make use of the fusion rule @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "thus we get @xmath41 in the three - body term , also the oscillating part of ( [ : nn_r : ] ) ( with @xmath42 ) contributes . to compute it",
    ", we apply the following operator product expansion , @xmath43 .",
    "one obtains @xmath44 , from which the three body term contribution is evaluated . as customary ,",
    "it is now convenient to introduce charge and spin field operators , defined as @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "similar relations hold for the dual fields @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) as functions of @xmath28 ( @xmath3 ) . in terms of these operators",
    ", the hamiltonian can be separated into the sum of two independent hamiltonians in the charge and spin sectors plus a coupling term : @xmath49 in each sector @xmath50 has the the form of a sine - gordon model : @xmath51+\\frac{m_{\\nu}v_{\\nu}}{2\\pi a^2}\\int dx \\cos{(\\sqrt{8\\pi}\\phi_{\\nu})},\\quad \\nu = c , s;\\ ] ] whereas the coupling hamiltonian @xmath52 reads @xmath53 .",
    "the coefficients of the luttinger and mass terms are defined as follows : @xmath54\\quad ; \\quad v_{\\nu}=2a\\left[2-\\frac{x}{2}-\\frac{x}{\\pi^2}-k_{\\nu}\\right]\\\\     & m_{\\nu}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left[\\frac{16x}{\\pi}-s_{\\nu}\\left(u_0-\\frac{3\\zeta(3)v}{2}\\right)\\right]\\quad ; \\quad       m_{cs}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left[\\frac{3\\zeta(3)v}{2}-\\frac{8x}{\\pi}\\right ] .     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 denotes the riemann zeta function .",
    "the competition of the kinetic and mass terms in ( [ h_separate ] ) can be discussed by analyzing the rg flow equations as in @xcite .",
    "apart from the gapless ll phase , two insulating charge gapped phases are associated to the pinning of solely the charge field to the two values @xmath58 . in a uniform unit - density background ,",
    "the latter values of @xmath59 describe respectively a mott insulating ( mi ) regime with localized holon - doublon fluctuations and a haldane insulator ( hi ) phase @xcite with  dilute \" hidden antiferromagnetic order of holons and doublons in analogy to the @xmath60 spin-1 chain behavior @xcite .",
    "when @xmath59 instead is unpinned , a metallic spin gapped phase is associated to the pinning of solely the spin field to the value @xmath61 .",
    "it actually describes the luther emery ( le ) @xcite liquid phase where spin - up and spin - down single particle quantum fluctuations take place in a uniform background of condensed holons and doublons .",
    "the @xmath61 value also supports two insulating fully gapped regimes , occurring when the charge field is pinned as well . in this case for @xmath62 the bond ordered wave ( bow ) phase takes place . whereas for @xmath63 a charge density wave ( cdw ) phase with holon - doublon antiferromagnetic ordering is obtained .",
    "the five gapped or partly gapped phases can be characterized by the non - vanishing of the appropriate parity or string non - local order parameter , defined respectively as @xmath64 this is reported in table [ table1 ] , following the procedure outlined in @xcite . in particular , the hi phase turns out to have non - trivial topological properties , as the presence of degenerate edge modes @xcite .",

    "for instance , as reported in fig .",
    "1 , already at @xmath76 by varying @xmath77 and @xmath78 the ll , mi and le regimes are achieved .",
    "to gain further insight into the zero temperature phase diagram , we may regard hamiltonian ( [ hamnormord ] ) as the sum of two single - species hamiltonians , already containing part of the interaction non perturbatively , plus an inter - species part : @xmath79 here @xmath80 is given by the first two terms in ( [ hamnormord ] ) .",
    "up to a multiplicative constant @xmath81 , the single - species hamiltonian @xmath82 is a long - range  t - v \" model , which is known to have a gapless luttinger liquid phase for small enough interaction strength . in this case",
    "the luttinger parameter @xmath83 can be evaluated numerically with high precision @xcite , and analytically both for vanishing @xmath78 @xcite , and for vanishing @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "explicitly : @xmath85^{-1/2 } \\quad , \\quad k(0,x)=\\left[\\frac{2}{\\pi } \\arccos\\frac{2 x}{\\pi\\left(1-\\frac{x}{2}\\right)}\\right]^{-1 } \\quad .",
    "\\label{kex}\\ ] ] of course , @xmath86 can also be obtained within a bosonization approximation @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath87 $ ] . at this point",
    "one can proceed to bosonization of the inter - species interaction @xmath88 .",
    "it can be added to the luttinger liquid phase of the remaining part of the hamiltonian , which luttinger coefficients may be determined either analytically or numerically @xcite . in so doing one ends up with a hamiltonian which is fully decoupled in the charge and spin fields . explicitly : @xmath89 with @xmath90+\\frac{m_{\\nu}v_{\\nu}}{2\\pi a^2}\\int dx \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{8\\pi}\\phi_{\\nu}\\right ) \\label{hamp}\\ ] ] and @xmath91\\right\\}\\quad , \\quad v_{\\nu}'=v_{\\nu}\\frac{k_\\nu}{k_{\\nu}'}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "now the study of rg flow equations can be done by inserting the non - perturbative dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath84 ( @xmath78 ) , while keeping to first order the remaining interaction in @xmath86 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the case @xmath94 has already been treated in this way in @xcite . at variance with what obtained with standard bosonization",
    ", the latter approach allows to identify a further bow phase already within one - loop expansion , thanks to the decoupling of the opening of the spin gap from the gaussian transition of the charge gap . as an application of our findings at generic @xmath78 and @xmath84 , here we report in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the phase diagram obtained at @xmath76 , where @xmath86 is given by ( [ kex ] ) . in this case",
    ", the comparison with the results obtained within the standard weak coupling approach of section 3 shows the appearance of a further non - trivial hi phase for @xmath95 . from table",
    "[ table1 ] it is seen that the latter corresponds to a non - vanishing string order parameter in the charge sector , which is known to amount to the presence of degenerate edge modes @xcite .     from bosonization analysis of section 4 . in case of standard bosonization of section 3 ,",
    "the haldane insulator phase hi would still be a ll . ]",
    "we have derived the bosonization phase diagram of a unit density balanced two - component fermi gas with correlated hopping , on - site , and long - range dipolar interactions .",
    "the power law decay of the dipolar interaction with exponent greater than 1 allows to re - sum its contributions into an effective short range potential .",
    "moreover , spin - charge coupling terms can be neglected having , in general , larger scaling dimension .",
    "the resulting bosonized hamiltonian consists of two spin - charge separated sine gordon models , which phase diagram can be discussed according to table [ table1 ] , depending on mass and luttinger parameters .",
    "we derived the sine - gordon models both within standard bosonization , in which case the single component hamiltonians were the non - interacting up and down spin models ; and by including non - perturbatively part of the interaction already at the level of the single component hamiltonians . in the latter case",
    "further features emerge in the phase diagram , noticeably a non - trivial haldane charge gapped phase also in absence of dipolar interaction .",
    "we expect that other 3- and 4-body processes @xcite could be included non - perturbatively within the ll regime of the single component hamiltonian , possibly inducing further orders in the ground state phase diagram .",
    "the present results should be compared with numerical findings .",
    "for instance in @xcite by means of a density matrix renormalization group @xcite analysis it was found that further exotic phases , not present in the classification given here ( table [ table1 ] ) , appear . in such cases",
    ", one should go beyond one loop bosonization , including higher order harmonics which were neglected here .",
    "finally it is relevant to underline that the previous quantum phases could be studied and probed @xcite with the currently available experimental setups as proposed in @xcite .",
