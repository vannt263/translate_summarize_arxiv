    "close - range , few - picosecond timescale dynamics are predicted for the bound initial state , compared to slower and longer - range dynamics from the unbound initial state .",
    "the time - variation is caused by two effects .",
    "firstly , the population density matrix that describes a time - independent distribution in the ground potential , no longer describes a time - independent distribution in the excited states since different potential energy curves govern its motion .",
    "the thermal distribution has a nodal structure that , when transferred to the excited state , forms distinct pockets of population that fall inwards .",

    "this further improves the coherence of the excited - state population .",

    "[ fig : pu - pr](a ) ) . in the rb@xmath0 pump - probe experiment of salzmann et al .",
    "@xcite , the sharp spectral cut applied to the pump pulse introduced a long tail into the pump - pulse envelope in the corresponding temporal domain . in exciting an atom pair , the pump pulse induces an electronic dipole which interacts coherently with this long temporal tail , causing oscillations in the excited - state population and hence the rb@xmath8 signal .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the observations of zamith et al .  in a rb vapour cell @xcite .",
    "these dipole transient effects are not apparent in the long - timescale pump - probe signals of this work due to the employment of a less sharp spectral cut of the pump pulse .",
    "fourier analysis of the positive - delay signal that follows the coherent transient peak does not reveal any dominant characteristic oscillatory periods .",
    "this is in contrast with the picosecond - timescale coherent excited - state dynamics predicted by the simulations ( which the probe pulse was short enough to resolve ) , particularly for the case of the bound initial state .",
    "the calculations of section [ sec : simulations ] revealed a wide range of conditions under which coherent oscillations may be formed .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the absence of such oscillations in the pump - probe signal can be attributed to an insufficiently position - dependent measurement being effected by the probe , for which there are two likely causes .",
    "firstly , the ionization mechanism of the probe pulse is not as well understood as for neutral - neutral transitions ( as outlined in section [ sec : simulations ] ) . in order to attain a sufficiently short pulse to resolve the dynamics , a large bandwidth",
    "is required which may therefore compromise selectivity with respect to internuclear separation .",
    "other indirect mechanisms , such as probe - pulse excitation to neutral rydberg states that couple to the rb@xmath8 potential , may also complicate the process .",
    "secondly , the detection mechanism may not be sensitive to very long - range excited - state population .",
    "further information is thus required concerning the nature of the initial population addressed by the pump pulse .",
    "these issues are further discussed below in section [ sec : bound - dimers ] .",
    "ground state ( labelled in atomic units ) .",
    "the experimental molecular ion signal from ( a ) is plotted together with an optimized theoretical fit for a distribution of initial separations around . ]",
    "the rb@xmath8 ion signal did not appreciably decay over the delays of hundreds of picoseconds that these experiments considered . in order to demonstrate that this large - delay signal is attributable to bound molecular population within the excited - state manifold ( rather than further coherent transient effects or photoassociation of an unbound 5s and 5p atom to bound molecular ions ) , a further study was performed .",
    "a fixed , positive pump - probe delay of was selected and the atomic and molecular ion signals were recorded as a function of the position of the pump - pulse spectral cut .",
    "as the pump - pulse spectral cut was further detuned from the atomic asymptote ( increasing the binding energy of the energetically accessible excited states ) , the rb@xmath9 signal was observed to fall off more quickly than the rb@xmath8 signal ( ) . indeed , atomic ion formation became negligible at detunings beyond , while a substantial number of molecular ions continued to be formed .",
    "the fast decline in rb@xmath9 signal is caused by the loss of spectral intensity resonant with the atomic transition .",
    "hence less atomic population is excited and subsequently ionized .",
    "the rb@xmath8 signal persists , however , due to excitation into bound vibrational levels below the atomic asymptote .",
    "the difference between the rb@xmath9 and rb@xmath8 data series ( shaded ) therefore provides strong evidence for the formation of bound molecular wavepackets by the pump pulse .    in order to study the initial state that contributed to this pump - probe signal",
    ", theoretical calculations were performed of the excited - state population transfer induced by a realistic experimental pump pulse as a function of spectral cut detuning ( ) , and repeated for pairs of atoms with a range of initial separations .",
    "the asymptotic long - range form of the excited - state potentials scales as @xmath15 due to dipole - dipole interactions , whereas the ground - state potentials scale as @xmath16 due to van der waals interactions .",
    "the pump - pulse transition energy therefore becomes more red - detuned from the atomic asymptote at closer range . as a consequence ,",
    "these simulated population transfers fall off more slowly with spectral cut detuning for closer range initial populations .     and a scattering state , together with an analytical best fit of the population that contributes to the pump - probe signal .",
    "the contributing population is of longer range than the background molecules , but is consistent with the association of unbound scattering atoms by the pump pulse .",
    "dissociation of molecular ions by the tof electric field is calculated to account for the lack of contribution of very long - range scattering atom pairs to the rb@xmath8 signal . ]",
    "the atom pairs contributing to this pump - probe process will realistically be distributed over a range of internuclear separations rather than located at a single point ; indeed , the fact that the experimental data span a number of these theoretical series corroborates this picture .",
    "excellent agreement was found when the initial population distribution was fitted to the experimental data ( ) .",
    "several analytical forms of the initial distributions were found to fit the data closely ; all shared the common characteristic that population was concentrated at internuclear separations of ( see ) .",
    "by contrast , the outer turning point of the most populated triplet vibrational state according to the study of section [ sec : initial - state ] is located at .",
    "this provides evidence that the population addressed by the pump and probe pulses is different from the background triplet distribution photoassociated by the mot light . instead",
    ", the inferred distribution is consistent with the association of unbound atoms , coinciding with several antinodes of the scattering wavefunction . in this case , the detuning of the probe pulse from the rb@xmath9 asymptote might account for the lack of a contribution from the very long - range portion of the scattering wavefunction . as an alternative explanation ,",
    "our calculations indicate that the tof electric field is sufficient to dissociate molecular ions ( causing ) of longer range than around .",
    "we have performed a spectroscopic measurement of the initial state of the preformed molecules within our ultracold @xmath3rb@xmath0 photoassociation experiments .",
    "the twin mechanisms of three - body recombination and trapping light photoassociation are known to contribute to a background population of loosely bound ground - state triplets within the mot with relative impacts that are determined by the particular experimental conditions .",
    "our measurement of the initial ground triplet - state occupancy reveals a distribution that closely matches the photoassociative mechanism , confirming this to be the dominant contribution in this case .",
    "we have carried out a pump - probe study of the excited - state dynamics of rb@xmath0 dimers as the first step towards a fully coherent pump - dump transfer to the ground state .",
    "an ultrafast pump pulse was spectrally filtered to populate bound excited states only , and the resultant wavepacket was allowed to evolve for a controllable delay before being ionized with a probe pulse . by observing the large - delay behaviour of the pump - probe signal after the influence of initial transient effects , we have shown the formation of excited - state population that is demonstrably bound in character .",
    "we have characterized the population that contributes to the pump - probe signal and have found that its behaviour with respect to spectral cut location is consistent with the association of unbound scattering atom pairs , rather than the excitation of background triplet molecules .",
    "calculations indicated that the bulk of the excited - state dynamics induced from such an unbound initial state would occur at larger internuclear separations than are resonantly addressed by the probe pulse .",
    "this may therefore be a factor in the lack of experimental observation of pump - probe dynamics .",
    "the ultimate goal , however , remains the coherent control of this population so as to maximize the franck - condon overlap to the dump - pulse target state after a suitably chosen delay ; a signal presenting evidence of wavepacket oscillations is therefore required .",
    "simulations reveal that pre - associated molecules in an incoherent mixture of states can be made to oscillate coherently with timescales at relatively close range using a single ultrafast pump pulse @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the classical oscillation period of molecules photoassociated from scattering atom pairs is greater by an order of magnitude or more , and occur predominantly at long range where detection is particularly difficult . increasing the signal - to - noise size at the larger pump - pulse detunings that address the relatively close - range pre - formed molecules",
    "should therefore allow this coherent behaviour to be revealed and controlled .",
    "since the photoassociation rate scales in proportion to the product of the density and the number of trapped atoms , we identify these two parameters as targets for an improvement to our experimental apparatus . indicates that an order - of - magnitude improvement in photoassociation rate would provide a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio to probe the background molecular population located around . to this end",
    "we have trialled a dark spontaneous - force optical trap ( spot ) mot @xcite in order to improve density .",
    "this protocol is difficult to implement effectively in our existing rb mot , however , as the low branching ratio in rb to the dark state requires high extinction of the repumper , and we consequently saw no improvement in signal .",

    "some significant recent advances have used the approach of associating ultracold atoms , with the experimental realization of @xmath1 dimers in their absolute ground electronic states via techniques such as stirap or incoherent optical cycling .",
