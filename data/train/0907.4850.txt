    "heisenberg antiferromagnets on a triangular lattice are subject to ongoing interest due to a strong correlation between lattice geometry , electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "geometrical frustration plays a key role in compounds with triangular arrangement of magnetic moments @xcite and leads to particular characteristics including incommensurate spin structures and multiferroic properties.@xcite ternary triangular lattice dioxides and dichalcogenides have in common to crystallize in a layered structure with strong crystalline anisotropy perpendicular to the layers ( mainly space group @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) . in chromium based dioxides the most commonly established magnetic structure is a quasi two - dimensional 120@xmath3 spin structure , typical for heisenberg exchange on a triangular lattice , with a weak interlayer coupling e.g. in agcro@xmath0 @xcite , pdcro@xmath0 @xcite , nacro@xmath0 @xcite and cucro@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the latter two also show a magnetoelectric coupling where the spin structure induces ferroelectricity @xcite .",
    "ternary chromium dichalcogenides have been less intensively studied , and show a variety of different magnetic structures ranging from a 120@xmath3 spin structure in licrs@xmath0 @xcite over a commensurate magnetic structure in kcrs@xmath0 @xcite to a helix with an in - plane spin orientation in nacrs@xmath0.@xcite + the compound under investigation , cucrs@xmath0 , has drawn attention as an ionic conductor @xcite and is assumed to exhibit a spin glass state under the substitution of chromium ions by vanadium.@xcite a microscopic temperature - dependent investigation of magnetic and crystallographic properties is , however , lacking .",
    "cucrs@xmath0 crystallizes in space group @xmath1 at room temperature.@xcite the basic atomic structure consists of covalent - ionic bound s - cr - s layers separated by a van der waals gap causing strong crystalline anisotropy perpendicular to the layers .",
    "isolated crs@xmath0 is metastable and occurs only with an electron donor , therefore monovalent cu@xmath4 cations are intercalated between ( crs@xmath0)-sandwiches.@xcite the magnetic cr@xmath5 ions with spin @xmath6 form triangular layers which are shifted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as shown in the inset of fig .",

    "the magnetic exchange within the layers over cr - s - cr pathways is expected to be much stronger than the interlayer exchange via cr - s - cu - s - cr bonds .",
    "hence , one would expect to find the crystalline anisotropy to be reflected in the magnetic system , as described in the dioxides .",
    "nevertheless , early neutron powder diffraction experiments on cucrs@xmath0 revealed a three - dimensional magnetic ordering below @xmath11  k into a complex helical structure with an incommensurate magnetic propagation vector.@xcite this phenomenon can not be explained without interlayer exchange interactions which must be of the same order of magnitude as the intralayer exchange .",

    "a similar lattice effect occurs in triangular lattice cufeo@xmath0 , where a crystal symmetry lowering is found to lift the degeneracy of the frustrated spin system @xcite together with multiferroic properties induced by a magnetic field or non magnetic impurities.@xcite strong spin - lattice effects are also found in 3d frustrated systems , as shown for the well - known pyrochlore spinel zncr@xmath0o@xmath13.@xcite the compound was found to undergo a spin - peierls - like phase transition which comprises an energy lowering through a lattice distortion and the opening of an energy gap .",
    "the origin of this gap has been explained by clustering of the cr moments into weakly interacting antiferromagnetic loops.@xcite although the formation of spin cluster has been clarified , the magnetic structure is not fully understood.@xcite we claim to see a similar effect on a triangular lattice and report in this paper on the detailed magnetic structure .",
