    "<S> ,  as @xmath58 thus , the dirac correspondence between bra and ket vectors can now be understood as @xmath59 . above , @xmath60 is a positive - definite , invertible linear operator  that is a metric  @xcite . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , we have    @xmath61    where the first equality expresses positivity and the second expression provides an explicit formula for the inverse map in terms of eigenstates @xmath19 . as a result , assigning probabilities when measuring non - hermitian `` observables '' defines a new inner product , namely @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a simple calculation shows that @xmath63 and therefore @xmath64 for all states @xmath41 , @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact can also be interpreted as : @xmath4 is hermitian with respect to this new inner product .    in conclusion , from the viewpoint of a measurement , there is no _ physical _ difference between non - hermitian operators with real spectrum and hermitian observables . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one should be able to represent quantum systems either way depending on the situation . </S>",
    "<S> of course , in complete analogy to classical physics the goal is to find the simplest possible hamiltonian . </S>",
