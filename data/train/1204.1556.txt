    "the fermi - hubbard model has been the _ de facto _ playground for exploring the properties of high - temperature superconductors for more than two decades  @xcite . yet , still no analytical solution exists in more than one dimension , and state - of - the - art numerical calculations prove very difficult in regimes where the average number of fermions per site is different from 1 .",
    "unveiling the properties of the model in the latter regime , and addressing whether it supports superconductivity , may be crucial in understanding high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite .    more than a decade ago",
    ", it was proposed that one could `` solve '' strongly - interacting quantum lattice models by `` simulating '' them using ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the mott insulator in the bose-@xcite and the fermi - hubbard  @xcite models were realized in these experiments .",
    "however , current accessible temperatures for fermions are still higher than one needs to observe even the relatively high temperature antiferromagnetic nel transition in three dimensions .",
    "these experiments are done using atoms with internal degrees of freedom , which can be selected to emulate not only two - specie fermions ( fermi - hubbard model ) and single - specie bosons ( bose - hubbard model ) , but also particles with exotic statistics and/or pseudo - spins @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that experiments with two - component ( spin-1/2 ) bosons can lead to the realization of quantum spin models with tunable parameters  @xcite . in the specific case where the intra - specie onsite repulsion is infinite ,",
    "multiple occupancy of a single specie per site is forbidden .",
    "this case realizes an effective two - component hard - core boson ( 2hcb ) model , which could be thought of as the bosonic equivalent of the fermi - hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "similar to fermions , in the strong - coupling regime ( large inter - species interactions ) , the low - energy properties of this model can be described by a @xmath0-@xmath1 model  @xcite .    despite the outward similarities between the fermi - hubbard model and the 2hcb - hubbard model ( in one dimension they share identical thermodynamic properties ) in two dimensions , particle statistics plays a fundamental role in the properties of the system as the temperature",
    "is lowered , and in the selection of the ground state . at half filling , the ground state of fermions in two spatial dimensions is a mott insulator with a long - range nel order for any value of the interaction strength , @xmath2 . for 2hcbs , there is a quantum critical point at interaction @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is the hopping amplitude , which separates a phase with two miscible strongly - interacting superfluids ( 2sf ) at small inter - specie interactions from a mott insulator super - counter - fluid ( scf )  @xcite phase in the strong - coupling regime  @xcite .",
    "the latter state corresponds to a superfluid of pairs of bosons from one specie and holes of the other specie , and can also be interpreted as a long - range @xmath4-ferromagnet in the iso - spin language .",
    "it is expected that such big contrasts in the nature of the ground states result in significant differences in the thermodynamic properties as well .",
    "hence , for validating experiments with ultracold gases , which are performed at finite temperature , it is important to have access to exact quantitative results for the finite - temperature properties of the two systems .",
    "while there have been numerous finite - temperature numerical studies of fermions in optical lattices  @xcite , the same is not true for 2hcbs , in particular in two dimensions . in one dimension ,",
    "calculations were done introducing a generalized jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite . the three - dimensional model with _ attractive _ interaction was studied to describe the supersolid state of @xmath5he  @xcite .",
    "recently , dynamical mean - field theory results have been reported for the two - component ( soft - core ) bose - hubbard model in two dimensions with an average of 1/2 particle of each specie per site and large intra - specie interactions @xcite .",
    "it was found in those studies that , upon heating from zero temperature , the system quickly enters an unordered mott insulator .",
    "these findings have been complemented by finite - temperature quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations of magnetic phases  @xcite as well as a field - theoretical treatment  @xcite in the hard - core limit .    here , we utilize numerical linked cluster expansions ( nlces ) to provide a comparative analysis between finite - temperature properties , such as the equation of state , entropy , specific heat , double occupancy , and spin correlations , of fermions and 2hcbs .",
    "we are particularly interested in identifying at what temperatures particle statistics become important in different interaction regimes , as well as what kind of qualitatively different behavior is produced by the statistics of the particles below those temperatures .",
    "we also discuss the implications of having bosonic vs fermionic statistics for adiabatic cooling protocols and for detecting short - range spin correlations in ultracold atoms experiments .",
    "we note that the lowest temperatures that are accessible with nlces are typically higher than the crossover temperatures to the @xmath4-ferromagnet phase  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the behavior of the strongly - correlated systems that we study at half filling is that of a mott insulator with large spin correlations for either particle statistics .    we show that , in the weak - coupling regime ( @xmath6 ) , where the bosonic system has a superfluid ground state , the disagreement between properties of fermions and 2hcbs is apparent at relatively high temperatures ( of the order of the hopping ) . in contrast , by increasing @xmath2 in the strong - coupling regime",
    ", the agreement between the thermodynamic properties of the two systems extends to lower temperatures . for 2hcbs , although the @xmath7-antiferromagnetic nel ground state is known to win over the @xmath4-ferromagnet only in cases where the two species have different hopping amplitudes , the two phases are very close in energy for equal hopping amplitudes ( the case considered here ) as only terms beyond the second order perturbation in interaction determine the difference  @xcite .",
    "consistent with this picture , we find that at strong interactions , short - range @xmath7-antiferromagnetic correlations are large in the low - temperature mott region and very close for the two particle statistics .",
    "given that there are more efficient cooling techniques for bosons than for fermions , one could envision probing finite - temperature fermionic correlations using strongly correlated bosonic systems . here , we present evidence that , through an adiabatic cooling mechanism that takes place in the bosonic system , the region with exponentially large antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations in two dimensions is more easily accessible with 2hcbs than with fermions .",

    "we consider the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard hamiltonian on the square lattice : @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) creates ( annihilates ) a particle with spin @xmath11 ( for simplicity , we use spin instead of isospin for bosons too ) on site @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the number operator .",

    "is expanded in terms of contributions from all of the clusters , up to a certain size , that can be embedded in the lattice : @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents the clusters .",
    "the contribution of each cluster with a particular topology is proportional to the number of ways it can be embedded in the lattice per site , @xmath25 , and its weight for the property of interest , @xmath26 .",
    "the weights are computed based on the inclusion - exclusion principle and given the property for each cluster , @xmath27 , which is calculated using exact diagonalization  @xcite : @xmath28 here , we carry out the calculations up to the ninth order in the site expansion ( maximum cluster size of nine sites ) .",
    "nlces do not suffer from statistical or systematic errors , such as finite size effects and are not restricted to small or intermediate interaction strengths . for this reason , they are complementary to more commonly used methods , such as qmc simulations and dynamical mean - field theory , especially in the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath2@xmath29@xmath0 ) where computations in the latter approaches become more challenging . however , nlce results are useful only in the temperature region in which the series converge , which has been shown to extend beyond the region accessible within high - temperature expansions @xcite .",
    "the convergence of nlces can be accelerated by means of numerical resummations algorithms  @xcite . here , we use euler and wynn methods with different parameters and plot the resulting last two orders ( or only the last order when the two are indistinguishable in the figures ) . the results from all of those algorithms agree with each other in the regions shown within the small fluctuations seen in some cases at the lowest temperatures . these fluctuations , which occur below the convergence temperature of nlce direct sums , arise from numerical instabilities in the resummations routines .",
    "we work in the grand canonical ensemble @xcite , and so , the exact diagonalization for every finite cluster in the series is performed in all particle and spin sectors . for each @xmath2 , the partition function and all other observables",
    "are calculated in a dense grid of chemical potentials ( @xmath30 ) and temperatures ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this allows us to study their behavior at constant density @xmath32 @xcite , where @xmath33 denotes the expectation value .",
    "since only nn hopping is considered , properties of the particle - doped system can be expressed in terms of those for the hole - doped system .",
    "hence , in most cases away from half filling , we show results only for the hole - doped system ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "generally , when using qmc - based methods , the specific heat ( @xmath35 ) or the entropy ( @xmath36 ) calculations involve numerical derivatives and/or integration by parts  @xcite , which can introduce systematic errors . within nlces , these two quantities are computed directly from their definitions : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the partition function , and @xmath39 since we work in the grand canonical ensemble , where the chemical potential and not the density is the control parameter , we have written this expression in a more suitable form for numerical evaluation .",

    "the specific heat results for fermions and 2hcbs are very close to each other at high temperatures ( @xmath59 ) . in this regime ,",
    "the difference between the @xmath35 of the two particle statistics decreases systematically for all accessible temperatures as @xmath2 is increased . as shown in the right inset in fig .",

    "one can also infer from fig .",
    "[ fig : state ] that , regardless of the interaction strength , 2hcbs always have a smaller mott gap at zero temperature than the fermions .",
    "this , in turn , implies that around half filling , the compressibility is always greater for bosons than for fermions , at any given temperature .",
    "a slight upturn in the double occupancy ( @xmath91 ) as one decreases @xmath31 for the half - filled strongly - correlated fermionic system is a known phenomenon that has been attributed to the increase in virtual hoppings between allowed nearest neighbor sites due to the enhancement of short - range af correlations  @xcite .",

    "we have recently shown that such an increase in the double occupancy also occurs away from half - filling .",

    "we find interesting trends in the double occupancy of 2hcbs when compared to fermions , especially for weak interactions . as shown in fig .",

    "more importantly , whereas a previous qmc study by paiva _ et al . _ @xcite has shown that the peak location in the fermionic case changes non - monotonically by increasing u ( following the variations of the af correlations in the system ) , for 2hcbs , the peak temperature decreases monotonically by increasing the interaction strength .",

    "[ fig : ist](a ) , we present a similar diagram for 2hcbs . as expected from the large negative slope in the low-@xmath31 double occupancy of 2hcbs for small @xmath2 vs @xmath31 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : do ] ) , adiabatic cooling by increasing @xmath2 in the weak - coupling regime is much more efficient in comparison to the fermionic case . with the entropy per particle of 0.6",
    ", @xmath31 reduces roughly by a factor of 4 as the interaction increases from 1 to 24 .",
    "however , the underlying physics in different regions of the diagram and the change in the strength of af correlations is unlike that of fermions .",
    "as mentioned before , in the fermionic system , regardless of the value of the interaction , af correlations are always enhanced by lowering the temperature .",
    "so , based on their dependence on @xmath2 and how rapidly the temperature falls in the adiabatic cooling process , one could drive the fermionic system into the region with exponentially large af correlations .",
    "the latter region could be identified by the onset of a downturn in the uniform susceptibility ( @xmath99 )  @xcite .    on the contrary , for 2hcbs ,",
    "the peak in the uniform susceptibility does not signify large af correlations for weak interactions [ see figs .",
    "[ fig : sc](a ) and [ fig : sc](d ) ] .",
    "we emphasize this by plotting in the same figure the location of the peak in @xmath96 ( @xmath120 ) for a few values of @xmath2 . beyond @xmath121 , where the mott insulating ground state not only has long - range @xmath122-ferromagnetic order , but also very large @xmath7-antiferromagnetic correlations , the maximum of @xmath96 is likely at zero temperature .    , which is the location of the peak in the uniform spin susceptibility , and @xmath120 , which is the location of the peak in the nn spin correlations .",

    "[ fig : ist](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : ist](c ) provide further insight into the behavior of @xmath96 for different interaction strengths . by comparing these figures to their fermionic counterparts [ figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) in ref .",
    "] , one can see that unlike in the weak - coupling regime , where the results are qualitatively different for the two particle statistics , in the strong - coupling regime they are very similar [ as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc](a ) , the difference decreases exponentially with @xmath2 ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ist](b ) , at fixed ( and low ) temperatures @xmath96 for 2hcbs sharply drops to small values by decreasing @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ist](c ) , the isentropic curves of @xmath96 are almost on top of each other for @xmath127 for the entropies shown , and are expected to become vanishingly small at lower entropies that are not accessible to us .",
    "this is , again , unlike the trends in the fermionic model in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "the opposite is true , however , for @xmath114 where , at the entropies accessible to us , @xmath96 values of 2hcbs agree very well with their fermionic counterparts .",
    "so far , much lower temperatures have been achieved with bosons in optical lattices than with fermions . employing novel cooling techniques ,",
    "researchers have been able to access temperatures as low as 1 nk with bosons deep in the mott insulating regime  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown in experiments with bosonic mixtures and that the inter- and intra - specie interactions can be tuned using feshbach resonance and other techniques  @xcite .",
    "our results show that thermodynamic properties and short - range af correlations of 2hcbs are very ( exponentially ) close to those of the fermions for strong interactions and up to intermediate to low temperatures .",
    "therefore , by engineering the strong interaction regime studied here , optical lattice experiments with two - component bosons could also provide a tool for simulating intermediate to low temperature correlations in the fermi - hubbard model .",
    "further studies need to be done to explore the properties of 2hcbs away from half filling and examine their relevance to the fermionic case .",
    "we have examined the particle statistics dependence of the thermodynamic properties of the 2d hubbard model by means of an exact method ( nlces ) that yields properties such as entropy , specific heat , double occupancy , and spin correlations in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the results are valid above a certain temperature that depends on the interaction and the filling factor .",
    "we considered two - component fermions and 2hcbs and compared their properties at various temperatures and interaction strengths , up to three times the bandwidth .",
    "we have shown that for weak interactions , in the regime where the ground state of the two models at half filling have fundamentally different natures , the results for observables at finite temperature differ significantly for the two particle statistics starting at relatively high temperatures .",
    "in contrast , in the strong - coupling regime ( beyond a critical interaction that separates a superfluid from a mott insulator phase for 2hcbs ) , the agreement between the thermodynamic quantities of the two systems , including short - range af correlations , extends to much lower temperatures .",
    "we find that the trends in spin correlations in the @xmath7 direction are similar for both particle statistics and that the results differ only by exponentially small values for strong interactions .",
    "this provides an additional tool to probe correlations of fermionic systems in optical lattice experiments by emulating them using two - specie bosons , which can generally be cooled down to lower temperatures .",
