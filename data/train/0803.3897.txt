    "these sites are only accessible at far - infrared and ( sub)mm wavelengths . however , in these wavelength regimes , only indirect information about the forming stars can be derived . when the stars form , they start to destroy the surrounding molecular gas cloud and become visible at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the near - ir atmospheric window offers the unique possibility to access the photosphere of the stellar component  peering through the typical obscuring environment  while the diffuse cold dust emission does not yet dominate . + this enables us to study the fundamental stellar parameters of the young massive stars and the interaction between the young stars and their environments . additionally , these regions are young enough to search for relics of the star formation process by means of their infrared excess ( bik et al .",

    "this hypothesis comes from near - ir surveys that have unveiled the presence of young high - mass clusters close to uchii regions ( hanson et al . 2002 ; alvarez et al . 2004 ; bik phd thesis 2004 ; kaper et al .",
    "2008 in prep . ) .",
    "these surveys have provided a valuable view on the complex morphology of these regions via imaging . from such studies",
    "we learn that the detected embedded clusters differ in morphology between very compact and related to uchii regions , to very extended clusters with only diffuse hii emission . + follow - up long - slit spectroscopy of a few selected objects ( typically 5 of up to 100 or more stars in each field ) has allowed the classification of a few selected sources in these clusters .",
    "the diversity of properties of our selected objects spans between : ( 1 ) `` naked '' ob stars with photospheric spectra ( bik et al . 2005 ) ; ( 2 ) massive young stellar objects ( blum et al .",
    "2004 ; bik et al .",
    "2006 ) which show a large variety of spectral properties in the circumstellar material ; ( 3 ) near - infrared point - sources which are the counterparts to the radio uchii regions ( martn - hernndez et al .",
    "+ this limited number of @xmath0band spectra already demonstrates the tremendous power and diagnostic value of near - ir spectroscopy in characterizing the young stellar population .",
    "however , the complexity of the fields and poor spectroscopic sampling of the population prevents any systematic investigation of the stellar content in the context of their environment .",
    "+ two important questions still remain to be answered : 1 ) what is the high - mass stellar census of the young stellar clusters and how does this depend on the cluster properties ( such as luminosity and evolutionary phase ) ?",
    "2 ) what is the interaction between the massive stars and their immediate environment ? + the recent development of near - ir integral - field spectroscopy offers a great opportunity since it provides simultaneous and complete information on the stellar content and on the diffuse nebular emission .",
    "the fems project comprises a plethora of aspects relevant to high - mass star formation and evolution processes . with our multi - disciplinary approach we will be able to classify the stellar content and derive the distribution of ob stars , massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) and the lower - mass pre - main sequence stars .",
    "detailed stellar parameters of the ob stars ( e.g. , @xmath1 , log @xmath2 , @xmath3 sin @xmath4 ) will be derived by fitting the spectra using state - of - the - art stellar atmospheric models like fastwind ( puls et al . 2005 ) and cmfgen ( hillier & miller , 1998 ) .",
    "the ob stellar population also provides an independent distance estimate by using the spectroscopic parallax of late - o / early - b stars . for the very rich clusters we can derive a reliable initial mass function ( imf ) by having a spectroscopic classification of the high - mass end .",
    "+ the extended emission present in these regions in the vicinity of those massive stars can be utilized to infer extinction properties , and to provide details about possible outflows as well as the surrounding emission nebulae ( photon - dominated regions or pdrs and hii regions ) .",
    "this enables an in - depth study of the interplay between the stellar content and its surrounding medium as well as the influence of photo - evaporation and outflows .",
    "+ the fems project also follows a multi - wavelength approach , since additional longer wavelength data in the mid - ir , ( sub)mm and radio range will unveil the extremely embedded and possibly even younger regions of star formation as well as large scale outflows . in the end , this large homogeneous data set will give an unbiased census of all the young high - mass stars and their environment which is needed to construct a full picture of embedded clusters .",
    "the first sinfoni observations for the fems project were performed between february and april 2007 on 8 complete and 3 partly covered high - mass star - forming regions to demonstrate the feasibility of the projects as envisaged above .",
    "the observations were performed with sinfoni in the h+k setting ( r=1500 ) using a 1/2-overlap raster technique to mosaic a typical area of 50@xmath550@xmath6 .",
    "+ in the following sections , we describe a few preliminary studies that have been undertaken with these sinfoni data on three representative objects , included in our sample .",
    "the region iras 08563 - 4711 coincides with the location of an hii region in the vela molecular ridge , at a distance of 2 kpc .",

    "furthermore , the spectrophotometric distance agrees with the distance derived from @xmath11 measurements of cs ( bronfman 1996 ) .",
    "+ the b - stars are spread out over an enormous range of extinctions , ranging from @xmath7 @xmath12 323 mag , reflecting the fact that some of them are located in the outskirts , where the extinction is higher due to remnant blobs of dense material not yet dispersed by the inner cluster stars .",
    "this cmd shows that we can access the high - mass stellar populations up to @xmath7 s @xmath8 30 mag for the o stars while the low - mass pre - main sequence population in the hii region is also detected .",

    "the combination of sinfoni data with spitzer and mm data is a very powerful way to detect different stages of star formation .",

    "a cluster of red sources appears in the proximity of the uchii region , albeit no near - ir counterpart is detected at the location of the radio continuum source .",
    "two objects with strong near - ir excess were considered to be massive yso candidates through long - slit spectroscopic studies in the k - band ( bik et al .",
    "persi & tapia ( 2003 ) concluded from mid - ir data that the luminosity budget of the southern source ( nr118 ) corresponds to a spectral type later than b3 .",
    "+ our preliminary analysis of the sinfoni data on point - like sources shows that this last yso candidate has a very rich hydrogen recombination line spectrum ( brackett and pfund series ) indicating hot ionized hydrogen .",
    "this suggests the presence of hot dense material close to the central star .",
    "the northern yso candidate ( nr114 ) does not show radio continuum emission in vla observations ( gomez , rodriguez & garay , 2002 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the h@xmath9 v=1 - 0s(1 ) mosaic map of this region shows very prominent unresolved line emission at three locations ( see fig .  3 ) .",
