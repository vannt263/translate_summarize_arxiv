    "it has been shown that layered magnetic systems can give rise to interesting functional properties e.g. an enhanced magnetocaloric effect such as in gd@xmath2(si@xmath3ge@xmath4)@xmath5 and ( mn , fe)@xmath0(p , si ) compounds @xcite . the magnetocaloric effect is associated with the temperature change of a magnetic material due to a change of the magnetization under applied magnetic fields .",
    "magnetocaloric materials are intensively studied because of the potential use for cooling and heating applications .",
    "the primary advantage of magnetocaloric materials , as opposed to conventional vapor - cycle based technology , is the two orders of magnitude larger entropy density in a solid near its transition temperature compared to a gaseous medium and an efficiency of the magnetic cycle closer to the carnot limit @xcite . nevertheless , to use that potential in an environmentally friendly and energy efficient way , materials not based on expensive , toxic and rare elements are needed .",
    "+ melanostibite is a mineral found in sjgruvan ( rebro , sweden ) and was first described by lars johan igelstrm @xcite in 1892 .",
    "the name melanostibite reflects on the color ( _ melanos",
    "_ = black in greek ) and composition ( _ stibium _ = antimony in latin ) of the material .",
    "melanostibite is a mn - sb - oxide with chemical formula mn@xmath0fesbo@xmath6 consisting of abundant elements and has a hexagonal crystal structure with space group @xmath7 , which is an isostructural to the ilmenite - pyrofanite group  @xcite .",
    "the octahedral representation of ilmenite - type structure is shown in figure [ mfso0 ] . in this structure mn and fe / sb",
    "are ordered in layers along the @xmath8-axis , whereas fe and sb are completely disordered within a fe / sb layer .",
    "recently , it has been shown that mn@xmath0fesbo@xmath1 mineral exhibits a ferrimagnetic ordering near 270 k brought forth by the mn@xmath9 and fe@xmath10 ions in the structure  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic transition in mn@xmath0fesbo@xmath1 is evident from magnetization measurements in low magnetic fields .",
    "nevertheless , its order and the magnetic properties in higher magnetic fields have not been studied yet . a magnetic phase transition close to room temperature and the layered magnetic structure suggesting that this material could give rise to interesting magnetocaloric properties near room temperature .",
    "magnetocaloric oxide materials with perovskite - type structure have been intensively studied  @xcite . to this date",

    "our results are based on magnetic- and specific heat measurements .",
    "the magnetic entropy changes @xmath14 for the mineral ( synthetic ) melanostibite sample was found to be 1.7 ( 1.8 ) j / kgk and 0.51 ( 0.46 ) j / kgk for field changes of 5 and 1 tesla , respectively .",
    "although @xmath14 is relatively small compared to reference magnetocaloric materials such as gd , we believe that our results indicate that new materials based on ferri-/ferromagnetic ilmenites such as mn@xmath0fesbo@xmath1 with improved magnetocaloric properties near room - temperature could be designed .",
    "synthetic mn@xmath0fesbo@xmath1 samples were fabricated using conventional solid state reaction ( including terminatory sintering at temperatures between 1300 and 1350 @xmath15c ) and thermobaric treatment under a pressure of 3 gpa at 1000 @xmath15c for 30 min .",
    "detailed synthesis conditions are reported in ref .",

    "the icdd pdf4 database of standard powder patterns ( icdd , usa , release 2009 ) was used to identify possible impurity phases .",
    "the cation stoichiometry of the mineral and synthetic samples was checked using microprobe edx analysis ( average of 20 points ) .",
    "magnetization measurements for all samples were done using a squid magnetometer ( mpms - xl ) from quantum design inc ( qd ) . for the magnetization measurements of the natural sample several small ( @xmath1710 - 500 @xmath18 m ) crystals of the mineral melanostibite",
    "were assembled together(total weight of 3.7 mg ) .",
    "specific heat measurements were performed using a relaxation method on a physical properties measurement system ( qd ppms 6000 ) .        incidentally , the melanostibite mineral was found ten years after the discovery of the magnetocaloric effect by e. warburg in 1881  @xcite .",
    "the magnetocaloric effect is related to the coupling of the spin system with the lattice vibrations of the material and can be represented by the change of magnetic part of the total entropy @xmath19 .",
    "for an adiabatic magnetization process the change of the magnetic entropy part causes an identical change in the lattice part of the total entropy - evident as a change in temperature @xmath20 @xcite . the magnetic entropy change for a magnetic material undergoing a second - order magnetic phase transition",

    "the magnetization curves for a mineral ( black curve ) and a synthetic sample ( blue curve ) of melanostibite are shown .",
    "in small magnetic fields ( 2 mt ) both mineral and synthetic mn@xmath0fesbo@xmath1 show a sharp phase transition .",
    "the transition temperature for the mineral is found to be @xmath39268 k and for the synthetic sample slightly lower at @xmath39264 k. the low temperature magnetization for a 5 tesla field revealed a moment of about 3.7 @xmath40 for the mineral and 4.35 @xmath40 ( 63.1 am@xmath41/kg ) for the synthetic melanostibite at 10 k and is in agreement with a ferrimagnetic arrangement of 2 mn@xmath9 and 1 fe@xmath10 cations ( all carrying @xmath42 , 5 @xmath43 ) per formula unit @xcite . for a magnetic field of 1 t ,",
    "figure [ mfso2]b , the transition appears broader and the magnetization is increasing linearly below @xmath44@xmath45 due to the ferrimagnetic type ordering .",

    "isothermal magnetization data and arrott plots for both the mineral and synthetic melanostibite are shown in figure [ mfso3 ] .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ mfso3]b and [ mfso3]d a positive slope in the entire data range and therefore a second order nature of the magnetic phase transition is evident for both the melanostibite mineral and synthetic sample ( banerjee criterion ) .",
    "furthermore , the presented data feature a set of parallel straight lines around the transition temperature which indicate a mean - field - like behavior of the phase transition . for the mineral melanostibite ,",
    "the behavior of the data is fairly linear as indicated by red line ( linear fit ) shown in figure [ mfso3]b .",
    "in contrast , some discrepancies presumably due to the presence of the secondary mnfe@xmath0o@xmath5 phase , were observed for the synthetic sample .",
    "the mnfe@xmath0o@xmath5 phase , as uncovered by our rietveld analysis , is also evident in the isothermal magnetization data as a hysteresis background at the highest temperature of 288 k in figure [ mfso3]d .",

    "melanostibite undergoes a second - order phase transition , hence the peak @xmath48 in the magnetic entropy change as function of temperature occurs at the phase transition temperature and is not shifted with increasing magnetic field changes .",
    "nonetheless , the transition was found to be quite sharp and the magnetic entropy change @xmath14 is estimated to be 1.7 j / kgk and 0.51 j / kgk for magnetic field changes of 5 t and 1 t , respectively .",
    "the magnetic entropy change for the synthetic sample can be seen in figure [ mfso4]b . the magnetic entropy change for the synthetic sample under a magnetic field change of 5 t and 1 t",
    "was found to be 1.8 j / kgk and 0.46 j / kgk , respectively .",
    "hence , both samples show comparable values for the magnetic entropy change of the order of 2 j / kgk for a magnetic field change of 5 t. interestingly , mn@xmath0fesbo@xmath1 crystallizes in a layered structure ( c.f .",
    "[ mfso0 ] ) in which the inter - layer coupling of the mn and fe / sb layers is antiferromagnetic , whereas the intra - layer coupling is ferromagnetic .",
    "it is well know that the carrier doping and associated chemical pressure may change the inter - layer coupling towards a ferromagnetic behavior , e.g. in perovskite manganites @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that cation substitution could be employed to enhance the ferromagnetic interaction in mn@xmath0fesbo@xmath1 , yielding improved magnetocaloric properties .     under 1 t field change as derived from specific heat ( ) and @xmath31 vs. @xmath49 ( ) .",
