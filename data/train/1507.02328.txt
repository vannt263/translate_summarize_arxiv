    "vertical transport of ice - covered dust to the less well - shielded layers of the disk , as well as ( inward ) radial transport , can lead to these organic compounds being released by evaporation and/or photodesorption .",
    "this is probably the origin of the h@xmath10co detected in hd 163296 , which lies outside of the co iceline at about 160 au @xcite .",
    "formation scenarios of the protosolar nebula ( psn ) invoke two main reservoirs of ices present in the disk midplane and that took part in the production of icy planetesimals ( see figure  [ plot_neb ] ) .",
    "the first reservoir , located in the inner region of the psn , contains ices ( dominated by h@xmath3o , co , co@xmath3 , ch@xmath11 , n@xmath3 and nh@xmath12 ) originating from the ism , which , due to their near solar vicinity , were initially vaporized .",
    "the ice vaporization distance never exceeds @xmath4 30 au from the sun , depending on the total source luminosity and characteristics of the collapsing cloud @xcite . with time , the decrease of temperature and pressure conditions allowed the water in this reservoir to condense at @xmath4150 k ( at typical nebula pressure conditions ) in the form of microscopic crystalline ice @xcite , leaving negligible water in the vapor phase to condense at lower temperatures where amorphous ice would be expected .",
    "it is postulated that a substantial fraction of the volatile species were trapped as clathrates during this condensation phase as long as free water ice was available within 30 au in the outer solar nebula @xcite and there was enough time to overcome the kinetics of clathration . on the other hand ,",
    "the remaining volatiles that were not enclathrated ( due to the lack of available water ice or a low kinetics of clathration ) probably formed pure condensates at lower temperatures in this part of the nebula @xcite .",
    "the other reservoir , located at larger heliocentric distances , is composed of ices originating from the ism that did not vaporize when entering into the disk . in this reservoir , water ice was essentially in the amorphous form and the other volatiles remained trapped in the amorphous matrix @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown recently that amorphous ice could form from photodesorption and freeze - out of water molecules near the surface layers of the psn @xcite . in these conditions ,",
    "the transport of the icy grains throughout the outer solar nebula would lead crystalline ice to be lost and reformed as amorphous ice . in turn",
    ", amorphous ice generated on the disk s surface could be transformed to crystalline as it migrates through the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "this cycling scenario needs to be further investigated if one wants to assess its role in the formation or destruction of the two original icy reservoirs .",
    "also , the different transport mechanisms must be simultaneously taken into account at the different stages of the disk s evolution to depict the abundance of water ice in the two reservoirs as a function of the heliocentric distance .",
    "for example , as described in sec .",
    "2.3.2 , it has been shown that vertical mixing can decrease the abundance of water inside the @xmath415 au of the disk .",
    "in contrast , it has also been proposed that the outward vapor diffusion induced by the presence of the iceline with its subsequent condensation in a narrow location ( with a width around 0.5 au ) would deplete the region inside the iceline of vapor down to subsolar values , and increase substantially the ice abundance at the iceline location by factors larger than 10 times the protosolar value @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent works depicting the chemical evolution of both solids and gases from the pre - stellar core to the protostar and circumstellar disk phases @xcite should be taken into account to update the representation of the two water ice reservoirs present in the psn . in these cases , midplane ices",
    "may have experienced multiple desorption events during the evolution of the disk . nevertheless , if one follows this classical picture , icy solids that formed at heliocentric distances less than @xmath430 au mainly agglomerated from a mixture of clathrates and pure condensates , whose ratio depends on the amount of available crystalline water and its clathration efficiency @xcite .",
    "in contrast , solids produced at higher heliocentric distances ( i.e. , in the cold outer part of the solar nebula ) were formed from primordial amorphous ice originating from the ism .",
    "therefore , depending where the outer solar system bodies formed , clathrates may have been agglomerated in comets @xcite , and in the building blocks of the giant planets @xcite and in their surrounding satellite systems @xcite . regardless",
    "the possible presence of clathrates , there is today indirect evidence that comets formed from crystalline water ice because their deuterium - to - hydrogen ratios measured in h@xmath3o are substantially lower ( @xmath4612 times the protosolar value ) than the most deuterium - rich primitive meteorite ( @xmath435 times the protosolar value ) , whose level of deuteration is expected to be close to the one found in the ice infalling from the presolar cloud @xcite .",
    "this difference can only been explained by the isotopic exchange between the deuterium - rich water and molecular hydrogen in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to enable this reaction , amorphous ice entering the disk from ism must have been vaporized prior recondensing again in crystalline form , otherwise the isotopic exchange did not occur .    30 au , is constituted from amorphous ices coming from ism . the second reservoir ( hot zone ) , located within the @xmath430 au , is made from volatiles initially in the form of amorphous ices that were transported from ism towards the inner and hot part of the disk .",
    "when reaching regions with temperatures higher than @xmath4150 k , these ices vaporized . during the cooling of the disk , volatiles located in the inner 30 au condensed again but in crystalline forms , including both pure crystalline ices and clathrates ( see text).,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "the origin of the volatile ices found in comets is a central issue for understanding the formation and early evolution of the solar system .",
    "there are three possibilities .",
    "first , one view is that _ all _ the ices are comprised of pristine interstellar molecules ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is indeed a strong similarity with the many known interstellar molecules believed to form on interstellar grains , although there are differences in the relative abundances of the volatile ices @xcite .",
    "until recently this idea was widely considered to be untenable ( see section  [ sec : cleeves ] and cleeves et al .",
    "second , at the other extreme , it has been advocated that any interstellar molecules experienced total obliteration and ` chemical reset ' in the disk @xcite . in this case",
    "all the volatile molecules observed in comets must have been formed by nebular chemistry .",
    "comets and meteorites contain both high - temperature processed materials , such as crystalline silicates , and matter that apparently formed at very low temperatures , as indicated by the isotopic enrichments measured in d and @xmath13n ( mumma & charnley 2011 ) .",
    "these characteristics are most naturally explained by the large - scale turbulent transport of dust and gas from different nebular chemical environments into the comet - formation zones @xcite .",
    "the recognition that non - equilibrium models of nebular chemistry are essential , particularly in the comet - forming regions , has motivated many detailed studies of protoplanetary disk chemistry , as recently reviewed by @xcite ( see also section  [ sec : turb ] ) .",
    "turbulence leads to an outward radial diffusion of material from the hot inner nebula and an inwards advection of material from the cooler outer nebula .",
    "it also leads to vertical mixing and thus to midplane material experiencing the enhanced uv and x - ray fluxes of the upper disk layers ( glassgold et al .",
    "hence , in this third partially - mixed scenario some specific volatile molecules and isotopic ratios could be remnant interstellar matter , or derive from warm and cold regions of the nebula ( as reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "deciding between such molecular origins has been problematic .",
    "molecular deuteration provides a potential clue to the history of cometary volatiles .",
    "although deuterium in the universe is a tiny fraction with respect to the hydrogen ( d / h=[2.535@xmath140.05]@xmath15 : pettini & cooke 2012 ) , its abundance in interstellar molecules has an enormous diagnostic power , because it may be much larger that the elemental d / h ratio .",
    "this generally occurs in cold ( @xmath16 3050 k ) environments and in trace species , namely molecules with abundances smaller than @xmath17 .    _",
    "the first key point to keep in mind is that , in cold gas , the major deuterium reservoir is hd and only a small fraction of deuterium is locked in other species . _ an exception to this rule is represented by the water , whose abundance can reach @xmath18 and , consequently , water might trap a substantial fraction of deuterium .    _",
    "the second key point is that the deuterium atoms are `` extracted '' from the hd molecules because the cosmic rays that hit h and h@xmath3 create h@xmath19 ions , which in turn react with hd and form h@xmath3d@xmath20 ions .",
    "_ @xmath21 ( see also figure  [ fig : stern ] ) .",
    "the reverse reaction has a small energy barrier , which can not be overcome at low ( @xmath16 2030 k ) temperatures , so that the h@xmath3d@xmath20/h@xmath19 abundance ratio becomes larger than the d / h elemental ratio .",
    "the kinetics of reaction  [ eq : h2d+ ] at low temperatures is also strongly influenced by the spin state of the reacting hydrogen molecules , i.e. , whether they are predominantly in the @xmath22 or @xmath23 states .",
    "the higher internal energy of @xmath22-h@xmath3 means that the reverse process can be driven efficiently if the h@xmath3 @xmath24 ratio is large .",
    "thus , @xmath25-h@xmath3 acts as a `` poison '' for interstellar deuteration which requires that most of the h@xmath3 be converted to @xmath23-h@xmath3 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "reaction  [ eq : h2d+ ] is the first step towards the deuteration of the trace species , as h@xmath3d@xmath20 reacts with all neutral molecules and passes , once every three times , the d atom to the product species .",
    "this is schematically shown in figure  [ schema_deuteration ] .",
    "a similar process can also occur through the ch@xmath19 ions at slightly higher temperatures .",
    "schema of the molecular deuteration process in cold gas @xcite .",
    "molecular deuterium occurs through three basic steps : 1 ) formation of h@xmath19 ions from the interaction of cosmic rays with h and h@xmath3 ; 2 ) formation of h@xmath3d@xmath20 ( hd@xmath26 and d@xmath19 ) from the reaction of h@xmath19 ( h@xmath3d@xmath20 and hd@xmath26 ) with hd ; 3 ) formation of other d - bearing molecules from reactions with h@xmath3d@xmath20 ( hd@xmath26 and d@xmath19 ) in the gas phase ( step 3a ) and on the grain mantles ( step 3b ) . , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in practice , therefore , a molecular deuteration enhanced with respect to the d / h elemental abundance is a thermometer of the gas temperature .    _",
    "the third and final key point to keep in mind is that neutral molecules can freeze - out into the grain mantles and , in this way , they can be transmitted through the different stages of the star and planet formation . _",

    "conversely , the molecular deuteration in comets and planets can help us to understand in what epoch the relevant species was formed , at least in principle . in this sense",
    ", molecular deuteration can be thought of as an ariadne s thread which links the various phases of solar system evolution . for a more detailed review",

    "]    however , the assumption of interstellar rates of cosmic - ray driven ionization ( @xmath32 ) in the cold regions of the outer midplane has recently been called into question .",
    "@xcite showed that the effects of either deflection by stellar winds or magnetic field topology ( through the magnetic mirror effect ) could significantly attenuate the penetration of cosmic rays into magnetized protoplanetary disks , and substantially reduce @xmath32 by several orders of magnitude at the midplane . in this picture",
    "the only sources of ionization close to the midplane are scattered x - rays and the decay of short - lived radionuclides . in fact , @xcite had previously pointed out that inhomogenous random magnetic fields could also significantly inhibit the transport of cosmic rays throughout the disk and lead to very low values of @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite developed this scenario further by pointing out that effectively extinguishing cosmic ray ionization from the nebular midplane would greatly reduce the efficacy of reaction  [ eq : h2d+ ] and consequently the generation of enhanced molecular d / h ratios by nebular ion - molecule chemistry .",
    "they demonstrated that if the enhanced interstellar hdo/@xmath33 ratios initially available were lost , then nebular chemistry could not regenerate those currently measured in the solar system , concluding that as much as 50% of the earth s oceans and perhaps _ all _ cometary water is of interstellar origin .",
    "low values of @xmath32 will also reduce the atomic d / h ratio in the disk midplane and so reduce the d / h ratios and the level of multiple deuteration in the molecules formed in the scheme of figure  [ fig : steve_deut ] . this may account for the upper limits on hdco , ch@xmath3doh and ch@xmath12dod in comet hale - bopp @xcite relative to the large observed interstellar d / h ratios measured in these molecules , which could have been lost or modified upon incorporation into the nebula .",

    "differences in the reaction rates of symmetric molecules , e.g.  @xmath53o@xmath53o , compared to asymmetric ones , e.g.@xmath53o@xmath54o , can lead to the observed isotopic distributions , since the most abundant isotope is almost entirely contained in the symmetric molecules , while the rarer isotopes are in the asymmetric ones @xcite .",
    "however , the exact reactions by which this effect might be achieved are uncertain @xcite    the final possibility is isotope - selective photodissociation of co , either in the parent cloud @xcite or at the surface of the protosolar disk @xcite could also result in enhancements of the rare isotopes of oxygen .",
    "co dissociates when irradiated by far - ultraviolet photons with wavelengths between 91.2 nm and 110 nm .",
    "the dissociation process occurs in two steps , with co first entering a bound excited state before dissociating . as a result",
    "the co absorption spectrum consists of a large number of narrow lines at specific wavelengths determined by the vibrational and rotational levels involved .",
    "the change in mass between c@xmath53o and its isotopologues c@xmath54o and c@xmath55o slightly shifts the lines in the absorption spectra , and consequently the spectra for the different isotopologues do not overlap .",
    "hence when co is dissociated , either in the protostellar disk or in the molecular cloud core , the different isotopologues do not shield each other ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "c@xmath53o will become optically thick closest to the surface , in a region where c@xmath54o and c@xmath55o can still dissociate . when coupled with turbulent mixing that can transport the @xmath54o and @xmath55 towards the colder , shielded midplane of the disk this can result in the formation of water molecules that are enhanced in the rarer isotopes and which could later be incorporated into cais and other meteoritic material .",
    "the in situ measurements that rosetta will make will directly probe the isotopic composition of the volatile component of a comet .",

    "a puzzling revelation was the apparent severe depletion of nitrogen in comets .",
    "mass spectrometry measurements of 1p / halley s dust composition allowed to find that the nitrogen - to - oxygen ratio is depleted by a factor @xmath43 with respect to the solar value @xcite .",
    "subsequent analysis showed that the ice part of the comet is depleted in nitrogen by a factor up to 75 @xcite .",
    "this apparent depletion appears controversial because the n@xmath3 molecule , thought to be the main nitrogen - bearing volatile in the whole psn @xcite , has a molecular mass close to that of the very abundant co molecule , implying that the mass spectrometer aboard the giotto spacecraft did not have enough resolution to separate the two molecules @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite used the 2dcoude spectrograph on the 2.7-m harlan j. smith telescope of mcdonald observatory to observe the n@xmath26/co@xmath26 in comets 22p/1995 s1 ( devico ) and c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) , and found values around @xmath56 .",

    "moreover , efforts were made to find n@xmath3 using the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer , but with no success @xcite .",
    "all these observations , and many more , motivated theorists to try to explain this depletion .    in @xcite",
    ", the authors assumed that volatiles are accreted by comets as clathrates @xcite , and explain the nitrogen depletion by the low efficiency of n@xmath3 trapping in water ices .",
    "one of this work s conclusions is that n@xmath3 can be trapped only if water ice is present in abundance higher than 2.8 @xmath39 solar value .",
    "this is due to the relative ease by which co can be trapped in comparison with n@xmath3 , so this last can be clathrated only if there is enough water left after all the present co was captured . since n@xmath3 is trapped in crystalline water ice at temperatures lower than co @xcite , their work implied that comets might have formed at temperatures higher than 45 k , allowing the clathration of co but not n@xmath3 .",
    "this temperature lower limit is one of shortcomings of this model since in many protoplanetary disks models , temperature is thought to decrease below this value @xcite .",
    "the recent observation of the co iceline in tw hya also supports these models @xcite .",
    "another caveat is the reliability of the @xcite s determination of the n@xmath3/co ratio in clathrates since the potential parameters describing the guest ",
    "clathrate interaction in their statistical model correspond to guest  guest interactions ( case of pure solutions ) and not to the guest  water interactions usually used in such models @xcite .",
    "also , the model is unable to explain the thick n@xmath3 ice cover on triton and pluto , both bodies thought to be formed in the comets region @xcite .",
    "motivated by the shortcomings of @xcite , @xcite introduced another statistical model based on an appropriate set of potential parameters and that seems to address these issues . in this model",
    ", volatiles are also accreted as clathrate - hydrates , except n@xmath3 which , due to its poor trapping propensity , is assumed to condense at @xmath420 k in the psn and subsequently trapped in pure cristalline form in comets .",
    "later radiogenic heating by the decay of short - lived nuclides will heat up these bodies to temperatures enough to liberate the trapped n@xmath3 , but not co. in triton and pluto , the gravity is sufficiently important to prevent the gaseous n@xmath3 from escaping , and let it condense on the surface and form the observed cover . in the case of comets",
    "however , the gravity is negligible and the gaseous n@xmath3 will escape , leaving comets depleted in nitrogen .",
    "a shortcoming of this model is that no radiogenic particles were found by stardust .",
    "a recent model , applied to the description of uranus and neptune formations , also provides an alternative solution .",
    "@xcite proposed that the diffusive redistribution of vapor will remove the gaseous n@xmath3 from the region below its iceline , possibly explaining the probable nitrogen depletion in uranus and & neptune if they formed in this region .",
    "one can invoke a similar argument for the nitrogen depletion in comets . in this case , the co ",
    "rich comets will need to form between the co and n@xmath3 icelines , in order to accrete co in solid form ( since its vapor will also be depleted below its iceline ) but not n@xmath3 . the relatively small distance between the two icelines ( @xmath445 au )",
    "is however a caveat for this model since it imposes the formation of all comets in this restricted area of the outer psn .",
    "finally , all these models took the n@xmath3 depletion at face value .",
    "as discussed above , the n@xmath3 molecule s mass is very close to co , and the two molecules can be distinguished only using an instrument with a very high spectral resolution , such as rosina on board the rosetta spacecraft @xcite .",
    "if this ( or another ) instrument is able to detect important amounts of n@xmath3 in a comet , this might resolve at least part of the problem .",
    "since important chemical differences are known to exist between oort cloud comets and jupiter family comets @xcite , positive detections or definitive exclusion of n@xmath3 in both types of populations are needed before drawing final conclusions .",
    "the volatile composition , d / h ratio in molecular volatiles and the spin temperature , as given by the ortho - to - para ratio in water or other molecules , are considered to be possible cosmogonic indicators for comets and as such may be interpreted as providing information about the formation history of the molecules in question . in this section ,",
    "we discuss spin temperature as a possible cosmogonic indicator for comets .",
    "molecules that contain identical hydrogen nuclei ( like h@xmath3o and ch@xmath11 ) display nuclear spin isomers .",

    "the lowest energy level of para - h@xmath3o lies 23.8 cm@xmath43 ( @xmath434  k ) below the lowest ortho level , so when water is formed at temperatures below about 50  k , the formation of para states is preferred and the ortho - para ratio ( opr ) is less than the statistical equilibrium value of 3 . likewise for methane",
    ", statistical equilibrium corresponds to abundance ratios a : e : f of 5:2:9 and statistical equilibrium is reached for temperatures above about 60 k.    oprs have been routinely measured in water in comets since the apparition of comet 1p / halley @xcite .",
    "this is currently done by fitting synthetic fluorescent emission models independently for each spin state as shown in figures  [ fig : lulin_h2o ] and [ fig : lulin_ch4 ] .",
    "corresponding spin temperatures are determined by placing the opr on a theoretical curve such as that for water shown in figure  [ fig : water_opr ] .",
    "opr is also commonly inferred for ammonia by measuring the opr for nh@xmath3 , thought to be formed primarily via photodissociation of ammonia @xcite .",

    "for this reason , spin temperature has been considered a cosmogonic indicator in comets that can provide information on the formation temperature @xcite .",
    "observational evidence supports the suggestion that oprs do not change once volatiles are released into the gas phase .",
    "for example , recent results mapping the spin and rotational temperatures in cometary comae are consistent with a scenario in which the opr is unchanged by coma processes @xcite .",
    "also , the opr for nh@xmath3 does not correlate with the heliocentric distance ( and hence rotational temperature ) of the comet , nor does it correlate significantly with abundances of other volatiles @xcite .    however , it has also been suggested that the spin temperature of water depends on the evaporation history of the ice @xcite . @xcite",
    "found experimentally that the opr of water desorbed from ice after being vapor deposited at 8  k or formed via irradiation of a ch@xmath11/o@xmath3 mixture at 8  k was consistent with statistical equilibrium , suggesting that opr may equilibrate during the thermal desorption process or that energetically produced water does not undergo nuclear spin conversion ( to a lower opr ) in water ice .",
    "both formation processes for water in the @xcite experiment were energetic , and the authors note that the spin temperature of water molecules produced by non - energetic processes must also be studied before definitive conclusions can be drawn , especially since cometary volatiles may have formed by low - energy processes .",
    "nonetheless , such studies raise the possibility that cometary oprs may not , in fact , be cosmogonic .    can the measurements of opr in comets shine any light on this question ?",
    "we show the measurements of cometary opr in water to date in figure  [ fig : water_opr ] .",
    "water was chosen due to the greater number of opr measurements than for other molecules in comets .",
    "early measurements suggested a clustering near t@xmath58 @xmath4 30  k , leading many authors to conclude a formation temperature of @xmath430 k for a large population of comets .",
    "similar conclusions have been drawn from studies based on ch@xmath11 @xcite and nh@xmath3 @xcite , particularly given the lack of correlation between spin temperature and other properties of the observed comets @xcite .",
    "however , it must be noted that among the 20 comets measured to date , nearly all of them are within 1- or 2-sigma of the statistical equilibrium value , excepting the measurements reported for 1p / halley , one of the two measurements for c/2001 a2 , and c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) .",
    "likewise , half of all measurements are at or above the statistical equilibrium value .",
    "it is also notable that no measurements exist below a spin temperature of 20  k , and this observation holds for methane and ammonia spin temperatures as well .",
    "possible interpretations of spin temperatures measured in comets are therefore ( 1 ) that it is a cosmogonic indicator that gives the formation temperature of the molecule in question and therefore perhaps the formation conditions of the comet , ( 2 ) that it is a measurement that , while unchanged by coma processes , is set by processes occurring in the solid ice during or prior to sublimation .",
    "current data are not sufficient to draw firm conclusions at this point .",
    "even if further observations result in most comets consistent with statistical equilibrium , we may still be sampling cosmogonic material since it is known that comets contain material processed at high temperatures , such as crystalline silicates , which are interpreted to originate from turbulent radial mixing in the solar nebula @xcite .",
    "mixing of volatile material that formed at high temperatures in the inner disk to the comet forming region would have resulted in a higher opr than for uncontaminated material that formed in the cold midplane .",

    "a first calculation on isolated na(h@xmath3o ) showed that the interaction of na with one h@xmath3o is similar to that between two h@xmath3o molecules in the h@xmath3o dimer ( @xmath59 0.3 ev ) , which gives a hint in view of a possible replacement of a molecule of water by a sodium atom in organized structures .",
    "in liquid water , microsolvatation of sodium atoms has been studied on small clusters of na(h@xmath3o)n ( n=1 - 6 ) to mimic the water environment .",
    "both the structures in which na is positioned on the surface and the encapsulated structure in which na is surrounded by a solvation shell are minima on the potential surface .",
    "they are very close in energy @xcite    typical structures of na - h@xmath3o@xmath60 arrangements .",
    "top : na in the cavity inside hexagonal ice .",
    "middle : na replacing h@xmath3o in the crystal .",
    "bottom : na adsorbed on the surface of the ice .",
    "_ color code _ yellow ( na ) ; red ( o ) ; white ( h ) . ]    in the ice , the periodic structure of the crystal imposes strong geometrical constraints .",
    "the most stable structure , not found in the liquid , is the one where na takes the place of a water molecule in the lattice ( middle structure in figure  [ fig : na ] ) when the ice is formed ( @xmath61e @xmath59 1 ev ) .",
    "contrary to microsolvatation , the stability of na encapsulated in the bulk of the crystal ( @xmath61e @xmath59 0.5 ev ) , shown in the top structure in figure  [ fig : na ] ) differs from that of the adsorbed na according to the position on the surface .",
    "for example , the adsorption energies vary from ( @xmath61e @xmath59 0.6 to @xmath59 0.5 and @xmath59 0.1 ev ) when the adsorption takes place over the center of a surface hexagon , over a surface oxygen ( bottom structure in figure  [ fig : na ] ) and over an oh dangling bond , respectively .",
    "the most relevant point to this study is that the charge q@xmath62 on the sodium atom depends strongly on the position with respect to the ice surface , as does the adsorption energy .",
    "when constrained to stay in the cavity inside the hexagonal lattice , na remains largely ionized ( q@xmath62 @xmath59 + 0.9 ) which is close to the value of @xmath59 + 0.8 when na takes the place of an h@xmath3o molecule in the bulk .",
    "when na is adsorbed on top of an oxygen of the surface layer , q@xmath62@xmath59 + 0.2 , a value similar to that found for the isolated na(h@xmath3o ) complex . then , as the ice is progressively eroded by the radiation field , na eventually reaches the surface where it can desorb as a neutral atom when the upper layer of the ice vaporizes .",
    "the observed compositions of comets are the end product of a chemical history that began in the cold parent molecular cloud core .",
    "the change in physical conditions experienced by the core material as the core collapsed and the protosun and protosolar disk formed and evolved led to chemical changes that are reflected in the cometary volatiles that we observe today .",
    "each stage of evolution left its imprint in the mixing ratios of molecules observed in comets and disentangling their effects requires interaction between comet and disk researchers .",
    "the combination of the two fields of study provide a powerful tool in understanding the drivers that determine comet composition and conversely what the variations in comet composition can tell us about the relative formation conditions of these comets .",
    "protostellar disks provide complementary information to the comet observations .",
    "their chemistry is complex , covering ice chemistry in the cold , shielded midplane , warm gas phase chemistry and hot , highly ionized chemistry .",
    "comets form from the ices in the midplane , yet dynamical processes ensure that this region does not evolve in isolation but rather is the end product of material that has been processed in a variety of different environments and then brought together in the cometary ices .",
    "establishing the origin of cometary ices therefore requires not only studying the midplane but also an understanding the chemical and physical evolution of the disk as a whole . by studying disks we can observe the chemistry and physics that shaped the solar system as they shape other protoplanetary systems .",
    "molecular deuteration is a link that might tie together the disparate objects of the solar system and their formation history and give us the picture of the whole solar system formation history .",
    "however , at present this link has still weak connections that need to be reinforced .",
    "the advent of the powerful new facilities , as for example alma and iram - noema , will certainly allow this field to progress rapidly in the next few years .",
    "rosetta will provide detailed ground - truths for the organic and isotopic makeup of cometary volatiles .",
    "the new insights obtained into the chemical processes which likely produced these molecules  interstellar or nebular  will allow us to constrain models of the formation and evolution of the early solar system .",
    "its instruments will characterize the composition of the comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko and distinguish between the molecules native to the comet nucleus ( parent species ) and those generated by chemistry or by fragmentation in the comae ( daughter species ) .",
    "the observations it will make will provide new insights into the formation conditions of the comet .",
    "they will also elucidate the degree to which interstellar material can survive its journey into the solar nebula and from there into comets .    several measurements will characterize the its thermal history , e.g. , measurements of molecular spin temperatures @xcite and deuteration and of the abundance of argon @xcite .",
    "the relative abundances of elements can tell us something about the dominant molecular form of each element at the time of formation  if an element is depleted relative to others then the major carrier of that element must have been too volatile to be condensed at the time of formation , or must have desorbed in the intervening time .",
    "in particular rosetta measurements may help to elucidate the mystery of the lack of nitrogen in comets @xcite .",
    "a key measurement will be the ratio of oxygen isotopes in water .",
    "meteoritic water has a very different ratio of the oxygen isotopes compared to oxygen isotopes in the sun .",
    "rosetta provides our best opportunity to directly detect the isotope ratio from the early solar system , and in so doing will distinguish between the various theoretical models of how the oxygen isotope fractionation occurred .    in summary",
    ", rosetta s observations will provide new insights into the chemical processes that resulted in the formation of cometary volatiles and consequently into the conditions that were present in the solar nebula at their time of formation .    the work of k. willacy and c. alexander was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under a contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
