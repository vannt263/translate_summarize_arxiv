    "we have studied the static structure factors in the following three limits : @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 the transverse and longitudinal structure factors have a common form in each of these limits : @xmath15 where : @xmath16 are the `` running variables '' .",
    "the common form reflects the fact that the structure factors scale in the critical regime : @xmath17 if we keep fixed : @xmath18 the antiferromagnetic properties of the model become visible in the singularities of the structure factors in the limit ( [ ptn ] ) .",
    "the transverse structure factors are infinite in this limit ; they develop a `` hard '' singularity .",
    "in contrast , the longitudinal structure factors stay finite .",
    "their critical behavior is hidden in subleading terms which produce a `` soft '' singularity .",

    "the transverse structure factor of the xx - model ( @xmath26 ) is linear in @xmath97 , as can be seen from fig .",

    "the longitudinal and transverse structure factors coincide provided that there is no external field . in the presence of a uniform field , however , they differ drastically . at @xmath40 ,",
    "the longitudinal structure factor is infinite at @xmath31 , but becomes finite and monotonically decreasing for @xmath109 .",
    "in contrast the transverse structure factor stays at infinity for @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , on finite systems , the longitudinal structure factor scales for @xmath109  as was demonstrated in fig .",
    "3  whereas the corresponding transverse structure factor ( at @xmath40 ) does not scale at all , as can be seen from fig .",

    "this might indicate a change from a logarithmic behavior at @xmath31 to a power behavior for @xmath109 .    in ref .",
    "mller _ et al .",
    "_ reported on the transverse structure factor for @xmath111 ; they found already that the dominant mode remains situated at @xmath40 independent of the field .",
    "6(b ) tells us that the strengthening of the singularity at @xmath40 becomes more and more pronounced with increasing system size @xmath64 .",
    "in the presence of a uniform external field in @xmath112-direction the static structure factors of the xxz - model show up the following features :    1 .",
    "the longitudinal structure factors have a cusp along the line ( [ p3 m ] ) . in case of the xx - model ( @xmath26 ) there are no finite - size effects and the longitudinal structure factor is given by ( [ sf3gpid2 ] ) for all system sizes with @xmath113 . for smaller values of @xmath9 and @xmath24 ,",

    "finite - size effects decrease along the cusp with @xmath47 , @xmath114 . away from the cusp we find a more rapid decrease of the order @xmath91 .",
    "the longitudinal structure factor is finite for @xmath115 and @xmath116 , but develops a logarithmic singularity in this limit for the isotropic case ( @xmath32 ) .",
