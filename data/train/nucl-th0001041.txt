    "at present , it is commonly agreed upon that the fission process is a dissipative phenomena , where initial energy of the collective variables get dissipated into the internal degrees of freedom of nuclear fluid giving rise to the increase in internal excitation energy . as dissipation",
    "is referred to the interaction of the system coordinate with the large number of degrees of freedom of the surrounding reservoir , this process is always associated with the fluctuations of relevant physical observables .",
    "thus , the dynamics of fission process resembles the standard brownian motion problem , where the collective variables such as shape degrees of freedom act as brownian particles interacting stochastically with large number of internal nucleonic degrees of freedom constituting the surrounding bath. this mesoscopic description is inevitable once the fluctuations of the observables are amenable to experimental observation .",
    "there have been several attempts in the past to study the dynamics of fission by solving either the langevin equation @xcite , or multidimensional fokker - planck equation @xcite , which is a differential version of langevin equation . in the case of fission",
    ", it is experimentally observed that the variances of the physical observables are , in general , small compared to their respective mean values ( typically , the ratio of the root mean square deviation and the mean of the kinetic energy is @xmath0 0.1 ) .",
    "the question naturally arises whether one can utilise this simple fact in the theoretical scheme instead of solving the langevin equation ( le ) or corresponding fokker - planck equation in detail . in this spirit",
    ", we present an alternative theoretical prescription for the calculation of various moments of the physical observables related to the fission process based on the assumption that the full solution of the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) admits an asymptotic expansion in terms of strength of the fluctuations .",
    "the asymptotic expansion method was first developed by van kampen @xcite for the stochastic processes having constant diffusion coefficients .",
    "however , a generalisation of the above prescription is necessary in the case of fission where the dissipation is usually assumed to depend on the instantaneous shape of the fissioning system and therefore the diffusion coefficients are also shape dependent . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such an application in the case of fission is not available in the literature .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report a generalised formulation of the asymptotic expansion of the fokker - planck equation where the diffusion coefficient depends on the stochastic variables explicitly . in this formulation",
    "the dynamics of the stochastic processes reduces to a set of linear ordinary differential equations which are far simpler to solve as compared to either multidimensional partial differential ( fokker - planck ) equations or stochastic differential ( langevin ) equations .",
    "presently , we apply this formulation to calculate the various moments of the relevent physical observables of the fission process .",
    "the paper is organised as follows.the generalised formulation and its application to the dynamics of fission is given in sec .",
    "the calculations and numerical results are discussed in sec.iii . finally , concluding remarks are given in sec.iv .",
    "the mesoscopic description of the fission process begins with a set of langevin equations :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given functions of the stochastic collective variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the fission process and @xmath6 refers to the driving noise term associated with the interaction of the _",
    "i_th collective variable with the reservoir constituting nucleonic degrees of freedom . for simplicity , we assume the noise to be a gaussian white with zero mean and decoupled for different degrees of freedom with auto - correlation functions given by    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the diffusion coefficient associated with _",
    "i_th variable , depending only on the sample space @xmath9 for the stochastic variable @xmath10 .",

    "if we are interested in finding the time evolution of the conditional probability distribution function then we have to solve eq.(2.3 ) with initial values @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17@xmath18 , at @xmath19 .",
    "that is , we have to solve eq.(2.3 ) for those realisations which are known to start from these specific points in the whole sample space .    in the cases where diffusion coefficient is constant the asymptotic expansion method of van kampen @xcite",
    "consists of writing the stochastic variables as the sum of deterministic value and a fluctuating part at each time @xmath14 with root of the diffusion constant as a strength of the fluctuating part . in the present paper ,",
    "we generalise this method for the situations where the diffusion coefficients depend on the stochastic variables explicitly .",
    "such a situation is encountered in the case of fission process , where the friction coefficient depends explicitly on the collective variable or shape of the nucleus at each instant of time . in this case , we further assume that , in the asymptotic expansion , the strengths of the fluctuating parts of the stochastic variables depend only on the deterministic values of the respective @xmath20 variables :    @xmath21    the quantities @xmath22 refer to the fluctuations of the stochastic variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 around their deterministic values @xmath25 .",
    "next , we introduce the new distribution function @xmath26 depending only on the variables @xmath27,@xmath28 and @xmath14 .",

    "this assumption makes the calculation extremely simple .",

    "similarly , one observes from eq.(2.12 ) ,    @xmath65      in the fission process , in accordance with our previous work @xcite , the shape of the fissioning nucleus is described in terms of the elongation axis ( the neck parameter of @xcite taken equal to zero ) .",

    "we further assume that the collisional time scale of the nucleonic degrees of freedom is much shorter than the time scale of the macroscopic evolution of the collective variable so that at each instant of time the heat bath is assumed to be in quasi - stationary equilibrium .    the euler - lagrange equations ( 2.6 )",

    "the probability distribution function @xmath98 could be obtained as    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the probability distribution of position and velocity of the stochastic variables at the initial time . as described by the initial condition(2.20 ) , this can be represented as    @xmath101    here , we assumed that each fissioning nucleus in the ensemble starts from a fixed initial position but with different partioning of initial excitation energy@xcite . finally ,",
    "substitution of eq.(2.22 ) in eq.(2.21 ) would give    @xmath102    the asymptotic expansion in our model thus provides the following picture : in the zeroth order approximation , the motion is described by the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "this requires the initial momentum as a generator of motion , which is supplied by a random fraction of initial available energy @xmath103 of the system .",

    "[ sig_asym ] .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ sig_asym ] that the theoretical values of variances have only a weak dependence on the fragment mass asymmetry .",
    "we have developed a generalised formulation of asymptotic expansion of the fokker - planck equation for the systems where the diffusion coefficient depends on the stochastic variable explicitly . with the assumption that the relative fluctuation of collective variable is small",
    "we have derived the equation for various moments .",
    "the formalism is applied to the case of fission where the fluctuation in total kinetic energy is small as compared to its mean value .",
    "we have taken only one degree of freedom , namely the elongation axis in our calculation .",
    "however , one could incorporate neck degree of freedom also in a more realistic calculation based on the present formalism .",
    "the primary motivation of the present work is to show that this formalism could explain the basic features of the fission dynamics quite satisfactorily without invoking the solution of fokker- planck equation or langevin equation in detail .",
    "the present model is found to explain fairly well the observed neutron multiplicities and their fragment mass asymmetry dependence as well as the average energy of the evaporated neutrons over a wide range of mass and excitation energies of the compound system with a single value of the viscosity coefficient , @xmath129 .",
    "the predicted values of tke are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data and the theoretical estimates of the associated tke variances are also found to agree quite well with the respective numbers extracted from the experimental data for the systems where the fragment mass yield data are available . for a more direct test of theoretical models",
    "it is necessary that experimental estimation of variances should not have admixture of other contributions arising due to the variation of mean kinetic energy over different mass yields .",
    "this may be achieved if measurements are done in smaller mass bins .    in the present studies ,",
    "the correlation of the position and velocity of the elongation axis has been found to be small .",
    "however , in the cases where such condition is not valid the energy variance still can be calculated by adding a term @xmath230 .",
    "the procedure developed here could systematically generate higher order hierarchies for relatively larger fluctuations than the ones encountered in the present studies . in those cases",
    "one may have to solve the higher order equation which would involve higher order derivatives of the functions @xmath231 and@xmath232 , in general .",
