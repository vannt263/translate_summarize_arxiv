    "gravitational lenses have become important astrophysical and cosmological tools in several ways .",
    "the frequency of lensing is in principle sensitive to the dark energy density ( fukugita et al . 1990 , turner 1990 , fukugita & turner 1991 , kochanek 1995 , but",
    "see keeton 2002 ) and the matter density of the universe @xcite .",
    "lens statistics also probe the properties of the lensing galaxy systems , such as their mass distribution , potential well depth and extinction @xcite .",
    "in addition , measurement of the time delay between images in individual lensed quasars can be used to measure the hubble parameter @xcite .    since the discovery of the first double quasar q0957 + 561 @xcite , about 80 lensed quasars have been discovered . in this paper , we report the discovery of another lensed quasar , sdss  j090334.92 + 502819.2 ( hereafter sdss  j0903 + 5028 ) , discovered in the sloan digital sky survey data ( sdss ; @xcite ) . there have been several gravitational lenses discovered previously in the sdss data @xcite , but this one is unusual in the way it was found .",
    "the standard algorithm for selecting lens candidates in the sdss involves looking for deviations from psf profiles for spectroscopically confirmed quasars @xcite .",
    "by contrast , sdss  j0903 + 5028 was selected for follow - up based on the presence of @xmath0 quasar features superimposed on the sdss fiber spectrum of a @xmath1 luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) . moreover",
    ", the sdss image showed another source about @xmath3 from the spectroscopically targeted galaxy as well as the presence of surrounding galaxies with colors similar to the lrg .",
    "while this system may be unusual , it is not unprecedented : the well - known lens 2237 + 0305 @xcite was discovered serendipitously in a galaxy redshift survey , and such cases are expected @xcite .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy at the arc 3.5-meter telescope showed that both main image components contain flux from a @xmath0 quasar with strong bal - like associated absorption @xcite , strongly suggesting that this is a lensed system .",
    "subsequent @xmath4 and @xmath5 band imaging at the arc 3.5-meter telescope in better seeing revealed the lens geometry more clearly , as shown in figure  [ fig : spicam - zoom ] , and enabled us to model the lens system . finally , higher signal - to - noise ratio , higher - resolution spectra were taken at the keck ii telescope . taken together ,",
    "these data make a firm case that sdss  j0903 + 5028 comprises two images of a high - redshift quasar lensed by a massive , red , foreground galaxy in a group .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the sdss data on this object , discuss how it was selected for follow - up , and describe the spectroscopic and imaging data from the arc 3.5 m telescope and spectroscopic data from the keck telescope . in section 3 ,",
    "we fit a simple two - quasar + galaxy model to the arc 3.5 m images and extract positions and magnitudes for the three components . with this information , we fit a lens model , estimate the velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy , and study the quadrupole moment of the lensing potential .",
    "we also decompose the sdss and keck spectra into quasar and galaxy components and find flux ratios consistent with the imaging data .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "the data on sdss  j0903 + 5028 consist of the following .",
    "the object was observed in routine sdss imaging in january 2001 . based on its colors and brightness ,",
    "it was targeted for sdss spectroscopy as a luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) and spectroscopic observations were taken in march 2001 . due to the presence of both quasar and galaxy features in the sdss spectrum , the object was included in a list of promising lens candidates for follow - up observations .",
    "spectroscopy of the two main components on the arc 3.5 m telescope in october 2002 revealed that they both contain very similar quasar features in addition to galaxy spectral features .",
    "this observation was followed by higher quality spectroscopy with the keck ii telescope and deeper , better seeing - quality imaging data with the arc 3.5 m telescope . in the following ,",
    "we describe each of these data sets in detail .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey is a wide - field photometric and spectroscopic survey being carried out by the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) at the apache point observatory in new mexico @xcite .",
    "the sdss multi - ccd camera @xcite will produce images for @xmath6 objects in five optical bands @xmath7 to a detection limit of approximately @xmath8 .",

    "sdss  j0903 + 5028 was imaged on 2001 january 26 with sdss identifiers : run 2074 , camera column 2 , field 113 .",
    "this field is included in the recently released sdss data release 1  @xcite .",
    "sdss  j0903 + 5028 is the close pair of objects near the center of the @xmath4 band image shown in figure  [ fig : spicam - zoom ] .",
    "the western member of the pair is a blend of galaxy and quasar light and corresponds to the combined object(s ) labeled g , b in figure  [ fig : spicam - zoom ] . in the photometric reduction used for spectroscopic targeting ( rerun 0 ) , this object",
    "was assigned sdss identification number i d 229 in this field . in the current ` best ' reduction ( rerun 21 ) , using an improved version of the photometric pipeline , the object has i d 186 . the eastern member of the pair  component a in figure  [ fig : spicam - zoom]was also identified by the photometric pipeline ( i d 228 in rerun 0 and i d 185 in rerun 21 , with the same run , camcol , and field numbers as above ) .",
    "it was identified as a faint galaxy , not a point source , most likely because of its close proximity to the b / g component .    in table",
    "[ tab - image - sdssmag ] we provide sdss photometric @xcite and astrometric @xcite parameters for both components from the ` best ' rerun 21 .",
    "since the seeing measured in bands @xmath9 was @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath12 , respectively , comparable to the separation of the two images , the a and g / b components were not fully deblended from each other by the sdss photometric pipeline . as a result",
    ", one should be cautious about interpreting the sdss photometric parameters for this object .",
    "more accurate astrometric and photometric information for the different components , based on subsequent arc 3.5 m imaging in better conditions , is given in table  [ tab - image - mod ] .",
    "the g / b component was targeted for sdss spectroscopy as a ` cut ii ' luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ; see blanton , et al .",
    "2003 for a description of the spectroscopic tiling algorithm ) and was likely boosted above the flux limit of the lrg sample by the addition of the blended quasar light .",
    "its spectrum was taken on 2001 march 24 with sdss identifiers : plate 552 , fiber 221 , mjd 51992 .",
    "this plate was observed for @xmath14-minute exposures , yielding combined spectra of somewhat higher s / n than is typical for the survey .",
    "the @xmath15 spectroscopic fiber was centered on @xmath16 ( j2000 ) ; in figure  [ fig : spicam - zoom ] , this corresponds approximately to centering on the g component .",
    "the sdss spectrum , shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , clearly shows absorption features of an early - type galaxy at redshift @xmath1 ( e.g. , the ca h and k lines at 5463 and 5510  ) , along with strong quasar emission lines with a peak redshift of @xmath17 .",
    "the surrounding field in figure  [ fig : spicam - zoom ] shows several fainter galaxies with colors similar to those of the g / b component of sdss  j0903 + 5028 , suggesting the presence of a small galaxy group associated with the lrg .",
    "we have applied a group finding algorithm which looks for a red - sequence in color - magnitude space for over - dense regions , the maxbcg algorithm @xcite . the algorithm does not find a cluster or group centered at the lens galaxy since it is not a local maximum of the galaxy density on cluster length scales .",
    "however it does find two small nearby clusters , both about @xmath18 away and both with photometric redshifts of z=@xmath19 .",
    "the lens galaxy sits right between these two clusters and they are aligned north and south of the lens .",
    "the properties of these photometric clusters are summarized in table  [ tab - maxbcg ] .",
    "the actual physics of these two clusters will require a detailed spectroscopic study : they may be part of one bigger cluster or set of merging clusters that span the entire region including the compact group of galaxies surrounding the lens galaxy shown in figure  [ fig : spicam - zoom ] , but the precision of photometric redshifts does not allow definitive answers to these kind of questions .",
    "sdss  j0903 + 5028 was recognized as a possible gravitational lens during routine testing of the spectroscopic outputs of the sdss .",
    "there are two independent sdss software pipelines developed for classifying spectra and assigning redshifts : spectro1d ( briefly described by stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ; for more detail , see subbarao et al .",
    "2003 ) , which uses both cross - correlation via fourier transforms with a family of templates and emission line identification , and specbs @xcite , which uses @xmath20 template fits in wavelength space .",
    "significant discrepancies in redshifts and/or classifications between the two were examined by eye .",
    "one common type of discrepancy arises when light from superposed objects falls within the @xmath15 spectroscopic fiber , and the two pipelines make different choices about which object s redshift to report . in dr1",
    ", there were half a dozen galaxy - quasar superpositions at very different redshifts identified in this way , including sdss  j0903 + 5028 .",
    "none of the others appear to be lenses . in the case of sdss  j0903 + 5028 , spectro1d returned a classification of galaxy with a redshift of @xmath1 at 94% confidence , while specbs returned a classification of quasar with a redshift ( albeit incorrect ) of @xmath21 .",
    "in addition to comparison of the two pipelines , the spectro1d pipeline also flags spectra which cross - correlate with two templates at substantially different redshifts at high confidence level .",
    "such was the case with sdss  j0903 + 5028 : spectro1d reported a significant ( 80% confidence ) @xmath22 cross - correlation peak for this spectrum with a quasar template .",
    "the relative confidence levels of the galaxy and quasar peaks are in line with expectation , given that the galaxy flux through the @xmath15 fiber is about twice that of the quasar ( see below ) .",
    "one of the unusual features of this lens is the fact that the target was identified as a luminous red galaxy , not as a quasar : the lensing galaxy is brighter than the lensed quasar images ( see table  [ tab - image - mod ] ) .",
    "this system would therefore not be included in many optical searches for lensed quasars , because the brighter component has galaxy rather than quasar colors and because it was identified as an extended rather than a point source . on the other hand , in surveys that extend to faint magnitudes , it is not completely surprising to find such objects .",
    "for example , for uv - excess selected quasars at @xmath23 , kochanek ( 1991 ) estimated that in a few percent of three - image lenses , the lens galaxy flux will exceed that of the combined quasar light for surveys to @xmath24 ; presumably this percentage is higher for multi - band surveys that include quasars to higher redshifts .",
    "alternatively , the typical @xmath4-band flux for a spectroscopically targeted @xmath22 quasar in the sdss is @xmath25 ( psf mag ) , while the typical @xmath4-band flux from a targeted @xmath26 lrg is @xmath27 ( model mag ) . while this comparison is obviously biased by our target selection criteria , it is nevertheless suggestive .",
    "we conducted follow - up spectroscopy of sdss  j0903 + 5028 and other interesting lens candidates on 2002 october 9 with the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) 3.5 m telescope at apache point , new mexico using the double imaging spectrograph .",
    "this instrument has a dichroic at 5550 ; the red and blue spectra combined have a usable wavelength coverage of about 3700  to 10000 .",
    "we took a 22 minute spectrum with the slit aligned along the direction connecting the two primary image ( a and b / g ) components .",
    "although the two spectra were partially blended and of relatively low signal - to - noise ratio , it was clear after reduction that both spectra contained flux from high redshift quasars at the same redshift of @xmath28 .",
    "both spectra also showed absorption features from the galaxy . because the dis data established a strong case for lensing but were not definitive , we subsequently re - observed this lens candidate at the w. m. keck observatory",
    "we obtained a high - dispersion spectrum of both image components of sdss  j0903 + 5028 using the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ; epps & miller 1998 ) on the keck ii telescope on the night of 2002 december 5 ; see figure  [ fig : keckspec ] .",
    "three slit orientations were used ; here we report only the pair of spectra taken with the slit perpendicular to the axis separating the image pair , since these observations yielded the cleanest reductions .",
    "the night was clear , with @xmath29 seeing .",
    "a 900s high - resolution spectrum was taken for each member of the pair through a @xmath30 slit in the echellette mode of esi . in this mode , the spectral range of 3900  to 11000  is covered in 10 spectral orders with a nearly constant dispersion of @xmath31 .",
    "wavelength calibrations were performed with observations of a cuar lamp .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard bd+28 4211 was observed for flux calibration .",
    "the data were reduced using a tailored set of iraf and idl routines developed specifically for esi data .",
    "the smoothed spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : keckspec ] .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath32 in the raw spectra at 1450  in the rest - frame and @xmath33 in the smoothed spectra . as with the sdss spectrum ,",
    "the peak redshift is @xmath17 .",
    "however , given that there is associated absorption long - ward of the emission peak , this redshift is likely to be an underestimate .",
    "using templates from richards et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which allow for the possibility that emission is blueshifted with respect to systemic and also allowing for reddening of the spectrum , we find a best - fit redshift of @xmath34 for the less contaminated a component , which would place the associated absorption at roughly the systemic redshift ( instead of being infalling ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : keckspec ] shows that the two components have remarkably similar spectra and consistent redshifts .",
    "scaling the fainter eastern ( ` a ' ) component by a factor 1.3 leads to a good match with the brighter western ( ` g / b ' ) spectrum .",
    "furthermore the spectrum is by no means a typical quasar spectrum since it has irregular bal - like troughs .",
    "the fact that both components have these same rare bal troughs makes the lensing case very solid ; the fact that there is clearly a galaxy between them makes the case practically certain .      from the sdss imaging data , it was apparent that sdss  j0903 + 5028 does not simply comprise two point sources : the g / b source is extended and was tentatively interpreted as a possible superposition of the lens galaxy with a quasar point source . to further test the lensing hypothesis and to determine source positions and magnitudes for lens modeling , we obtained follow - up imaging data on 2002 november 13 with the arc 3.5 m telescope using spicam .",
    "spicam is a backside - illuminated site @xmath35 ccd camera with @xmath36 pixels and a plate scale of @xmath37 , giving a field of view of @xmath38 .",
    "because of the small pixels , this camera can take advantage of very good seeing . as it turned out , the seeing was @xmath39 , a significant improvement over the sdss @xmath40 . also , the longer exposure , co - added spicam images are about 1.8 magnitudes deeper in @xmath4 than the corresponding sdss image .",
    "we obtained four dithers in each of the sdss @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands for a total exposure time of 20 minutes in each band .",
    "these images were de - biased , overscan - corrected , and flat - fielded in the usual manner with iraf .",
    "figure [ fig : spicam - zoom ] shows a @xmath41 by @xmath41 region around sdss  j0903 + 5028 from the co - added @xmath4 band spicam image .",
    "the small group of galaxies is evident .",
    "based on modeling ( see below ) , the objects labeled a and b were identified as the quasar images , while the object labeled g is the galaxy image , blended with quasar image b. we used sextractor @xcite to find objects in the co - added @xmath4 and @xmath5 images and matched these to the sdss imaging catalog to obtain photometric zero - points and an accurate astrometric solution .",
    "in order to fit a lens model to the data we proceed to determine the positions and relative fluxes of the quasar and galaxy images . while ideally one would like higher resolution images for this purpose , we can in fact determine the configuration of this system quite confidently with just arc - second imaging .",
    "the co - added arc 3.5 m images in both sdss @xmath4 and @xmath5 filters are used to fit for an image model .",
    "the top left panels in figures [ fig : lens - model - r ] and [ fig : lens - model - i ] show the @xmath4 and @xmath5 band co - added spicam images of the @xmath42 by @xmath43 area around the lens .",
    "the object on the left ( east , component a ) is unresolved and is one of the quasar images .",
    "the object on the right ( west ) is resolved and it is evident from visual inspection that this is in fact bimodal , with a point source , the quasar , to the lower right ( southwest ) of the blended object centroid .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested by fitting the image to a simple parametric model and looking at the residuals .",
    "the simplest model consists of a two - image lens with the galaxy in between the two quasar images .",
    "there are some conditions that must be met for this image to be consistent with gravitational lensing .",
    "the quasars should have identical shapes , consistent with the local point - spread function ( psf ) , while the galaxy may be more extended .",
    "the three objects should have positions in the two bands that are statistically consistent , and the quasars should have nearly identical flux ratios .",
    "there are other conditions that relate the flux ratios and the three image positions that arise from the gravitational lens model ; we address those additional constraints in the section 3.3 .",
    "we fit the surface brightness of all three objects as two - dimensional @xmath44-distributions , also known as moffat profiles . a normalized ,",
    "2d @xmath44-distribution is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 , the vector @xmath47 is the image centroid , and @xmath48 is the @xmath49 symmetric matrix of moments which determines the shape of the elliptical isophotes .",
    "the free parameter @xmath50 determines the logarithmic slope of the asymptotic profile . in the limit @xmath51 ,",
    "the surface brightness becomes a gaussian , @xmath52 ; even for finite @xmath50 , @xmath53 is approximately gaussian near the centroid .",
    "our psfs are well fit by @xmath54 , so we fix @xmath50 to this value for the two point sources .",
    "the galaxy is also reasonably well fit by a @xmath54 profile ( but with different moments ) , but it is better fit by a @xmath55 profile , so we use the latter .",
    "we further require that the quasars have the same moments .",
    "this leaves 15 free parameters : 3 pairs of centroid coordinates , 3 fluxes , 3 psf moments , and 3 galaxy moments .",
    "the fits are done independently in each band .",
    "the best fit values are presented in table [ tab - image - mod ] .",
    "the best fit dereddened magnitudes for the lens galaxy are @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where we have included all errors from shot noise , calibration , and model degeneracy .",
    "we can use the measured redshift of 0.388 to calculate absolute magnitudes in both bands and then use the @xmath58 relation @xcite to estimate the galaxy velocity dispersion in each band .",
    "we use @xmath59-corrections from bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) and correct for luminosity evolution using bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to arrive at @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the galaxy is therefore very luminous ; about @xmath62 in both bands . using the @xmath58 relations and the @xmath58 scatter from bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we estimate the velocity dispersion as @xmath63 km / s and @xmath64 km / s .",
    "typical lens galaxy velocity dispersions are 200 - 300 km / s , so these values are not unusual ; they are also consistent with the velocity dispersion inferred from the lens model below .",
    "the top two panels of figures [ fig : lens - model - r ] and [ fig : lens - model - i ] show the spicam data along with the best fit model .",
    "the middle panels show the best fit model separated into the quasars and galaxy .",
    "the lower panels show the residual image ( image@xmath65model ) and a contour plot with the relative positions and fluxes of the three components .",
    "one can see that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 data give visually consistent results .",
    "the best fit models have reduced @xmath66 of 0.99 in @xmath4 and 1.00 in @xmath5 , indicating that the model is a good fit to both bands .",
    "the inferred quasar flux ratios ( b / a ) in @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , consistent at the 1.3 @xmath69 level .",
    "the quasar separations are 283 @xmath70 002 in @xmath4 and 280 @xmath70 003 in @xmath5 , consistent at about the 1 @xmath69 level .",
    "the image model also yields a measurement of the ellipticity of the galaxy light .",
    "the uncorrected model galaxy ellipticity is @xmath71 in the @xmath4 image and 0.19 in @xmath5 , with position angles of 12.0 and 18.2 deg ( east of the north - south axis ) in the two bands ; here , @xmath72 is the ratio of semi - minor to semi - major axis of the surface brightness distribution .",
    "however , these numbers do not take into account the extent and anisotropy of the image psf .",
    "we correct the galaxy shape measurement by subtracting the second moments of the local psf from the second moments of the g model image . using these deconvolved moments ,",
    "the estimated corrected galaxy ellipticity is @xmath73 in @xmath4 and @xmath74 in @xmath5 ; the corresponding position angles are 24.8 and 30.8 deg . the estimated error on the inferred ellipticity is about 0.1 .",
    "while the image modeling above does not rule out more complicated lens configurations , it does show that this image is consistent with the simplest configuration of a two - image lens .",
    "we also note that we have applied this image fitting procedure to the lower signal - to - noise ratio sdss images and to subsequent cfht images ( taken in better seeing but with more complex psf structure ) with very similar results .      as with the imaging ,",
    "we have also attempted to model the various spectra of sdss  j0903 + 5028 as a sum of quasar and galaxy components , using principle component analysis ( pca ) . a large number of redshifted sdss quasar spectra",
    "are used to construct eigenspectra @xmath75 , which form an orthonormal basis in terms of which any other quasar spectrum can be expanded , @xmath76 . similarly , a set of galaxy eigenspectra are constructed from many sdss galaxy spectra .",
    "spectra can be usefully classified by their coefficients @xmath77 , provided they can be accurately reconstructed when the series is truncated at relatively small @xmath78 .",
    "three eigenspectra span the range of most galaxy types ; for quasars , more components are needed . here",
    ", we used 10 quasar and 10 galaxy eigenspectra , constructed from samples of several thousand sdss quasar spectra and about 100,000 sdss galaxy spectra @xcite .",
    "( the same galaxy eigenspectra are used in the sdss spectro1d spectroscopic pipeline to classify galaxies . )    to decompose a spectrum containing both quasar and galaxy components , for which the two redshifts are known , we simply assume it can be modeled as a weighted sum of the galaxy and quasar eigenspectra , where the coefficients are determined by minimizing the @xmath20 of the reconstructed spectrum fit to the true spectrum .",
    "an example of this 20-parameter fit ( hereafter called model i ) is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : pca ] , which shows the best fit to the sdss spectrum of the g / b component ; for this fit , the quasar flux is about 25% of the galaxy flux summed over this wavelength range .",
    "unfortunately , given the nature of this procedure , it is difficult to assign an error to this value .",
    "in addition to the model above , we experimented with two other models with fewer parameters . in model ii , instead of using 10 galaxy eigenspectra , we fixed the galaxy spectrum to have the shape of the average luminous red galaxy spectrum constructed by co - adding a large number of lrg spectra @xcite .",
    "this makes use of the information that lrg spectra are quite homogeneous and that the g component has colors typical of an lrg .",
    "an example is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : pca ] , which shows a decomposition of the keck western ( g / b ) spectrum using this model .",
    "as with the sdss spectrum , the reconstructed quasar spectrum is a reasonable first approximation to the observed spectrum ; not surprisingly , this procedure does not capture the bal - like features , since the parent sample of sdss quasar spectra used to produce the quasar eigenspectra did not include quasars with bal features .",
    "the ratio of quasar to galaxy flux for this model is 42% ; for comparison , model i for this spectrum yields a quasar / galaxy flux ratio of 48% and yields a galaxy spectrum with the general spectral shape of an lrg . the differences between this spectral decomposition and that for the sdss spectrum are not particularly troubling : the keck spectrum has higher signal - to - noise ratio , and it is based on a narrow slit with rather different aperture from the sdss fiber spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the quasar / galaxy flux ratio for the keck west spectrum model is in good agreement with that inferred from the @xmath4 and @xmath5 band imaging given in table  [ tab - image - mod ] .    in model iii , on the assumption that the keck east spectrum has little contamination by the lensing galaxy , we fit the keck west spectrum to a sum of keck east and the lrg template or to keck east plus 10 galaxy eigenspectra .",
    "this model generally gave poor or unphysical fits , consistent with the fact that figure  [ fig : keckspec ] appears to indicate that the western component is somewhat bluer than the eastern component .",
    "the latter result is somewhat surprising : given the lens geometry shown in figure  [ fig : lens - model - r ] and the results in table  [ tab - image - mod ] , one would naively expect the eastern component to be less contaminated by the red lensing galaxy than the western component , assuming the east and west spectral components correspond approximately to the a and b / g image components of figure  [ fig : spicam - zoom ] .",
    "this apparent discrepancy may be due in part to the spectral extraction algorithm , errors in relative spectrophotometric calibration , placement of the slit , intrinsic reddening of the quasar spectra , differential reddening in the galaxy , or quasar spectral variability on a timescale shorter than the time delay between the images .",
    "finally , we also attempted to measure the galaxy velocity dispersion from the quasar - subtracted galaxy spectrum , but it was too contaminated by residual quasar absorption features to obtain a reliable result .      to extract physical properties of the lens galaxy and its environment and to further test the lens hypothesis",
    ", we proceed to make lens models using the astrometry and photometry from the model analysis of the images .",
    "the uncertainties on the relative positions are @xmath79 in @xmath4 and @xmath80 in @xmath5 . for the fluxes",
    ", we broaden the error bars to 10% to account for variability , microlensing , etc .",
    "( see dalal & kochanek 2002 ) .",
    "we use standard isothermal lens models , because they are consistent with the observed properties of other individual lenses , lens statistics , and the dynamics and x - ray properties of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "for the modeling we use @xmath81 = 0.3 and @xmath82 = 0.7 , although these only affect the reported velocity dispersions and time delays , and then only at the few percent level .",
    "we use standard non - linear least - squares lens modeling techniques , implemented in the _ lensmodel _ software by keeton ( 2001b ) .",
    "the data provide eight constraints : two each for two quasar image positions , two for the galaxy position , and two fluxes .",
    "a minimal model has eight parameters : the galaxy position ( 2 ) and mass ( 1 ) , the ellipticity of the mass distribution or alternatively shear and its orientation angle ( 2 ) , and the quasar source position ( 2 ) and flux ( 1 ) . even minimal models therefore have @xmath83 , and so we are always able to find models that fit the data perfectly . hence to estimate the uncertainties on the model parameters , we repeatedly add random noise to the 8 data points and refit to obtain a distribution of fitted parameter values .",
    "the fact that the quasar images and the galaxy are not collinear indicates a non - negligible quadrupole moment in the lensing potential , which may represent ellipticity in the lens galaxy and/or tidal shear from mass in the environment of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the presence of mass ellipticity might be expected because the deconvolved galaxy light is elliptical ; moreover , the mass could be more flattened than the light .",
    "the presence of shear seems likely because of the surrounding galaxy clusters . to consider both possibilities , we first examine two simple models : ( 1 ) a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) model , where the quadrupole is due entirely to ellipticity , and ( 2 ) a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) plus shear model , where the quadrupole is due entirely to tidal shear .",
    "both sie and sis+shear models can fit the lens exactly , with the parameters given in table  [ tab - mod ] .",
    "both sets of models seem reasonable : sie models require a mass ellipticity @xmath840.6 , slightly larger than the ellipticity of the light ( @xmath85 ) , while sie+shear models require a shear strength @xmath860.18 , typical of lenses in group or cluster environments @xcite .",
    "there are small differences between the @xmath4-band and @xmath5-band models due to differences in the deconvolved positions of quasar b and the galaxy in the @xmath4 and @xmath5-band data , but the differences are only at the 1@xmath69 level .",
    "the models yield an einstein radius of @xmath87 , corresponding to a velocity dispersion of @xmath88  km  s@xmath89 for the lens galaxy .",
    "this number is consistent with the velocity dispersion estimates made with the @xmath58 relations in section 3.1 ; the estimate from the lens model may be higher due to the surrounding group slightly enhancing the image angular separation .",
    "the implied total magnification of the system is a moderate factor of 34 .",
    "the models also predict that the time delay between the images should be in the range 5772  @xmath90  days . because the predicted delay depends on the relative amounts of ellipticity and shear @xcite , the usefulness of this lens for hubble parameter analyses will depend on how well the ellipticity and shear can be determined independently .",
    "it is interesting to note that in both sie and sis+shear models the quadrupole moment of the lensing potential is oriented almost exactly north  south , while the corrected galaxy light is inclined at @xmath91 .",
    "a misalignment of more than @xmath92 usually indicates that the lensing potential has both ellipticity and shear with different orientations @xcite .",
    "it is pointless to fit models with unconstrained ellipticity and shear to sdss  j0903 + 5028 , because such models are under - constrained .",
    "however , analyses of other lenses suggest that it is reasonable to constrain the shape of the model mass distribution using the observed shape of the light distribution",
    ". the orientation angles of the mass and light are strongly correlated and typically aligned to within @xmath92 , even if there is no clear relationship between the ellipticities of the mass and light @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : shear ] shows results for sie+shear models where we either fix the shape of the model mass distribution to that of the light ( panel a ) or just require that the mass distribution match the light within assumed uncertainties of @xmath93 in orientation and 0.1 in ellipticity ( panel b ) . in both cases ,",
    "the constraint on the mass orientation provides an important lower limit on the shear strength . in other words , under the reasonable assumption that the mass distribution is aligned with the light distribution , the misalignment between the galaxy and the quadrupole moment of the lensing potential directly implies the presence of shear from the lens environment ( the group or nearby clusters ) . adopting a constraint on the mass ellipticity would then yield an upper limit on the shear , but this result is less reliable because there is no strong evidence that the mass ellipticity should match that of the light @xcite .",
    "we also note that if the two nearby clusters found by the maxbcg algorithm are indeed separate spherical clusters , they would produce a shear with the requisite north ",
    "south orientation ; however , given their relatively large angular separation from the lens galaxy , one would expect them to produce a combined shear of only a few percent .    thus , the lens models suggest but do not conclusively reveal that the group or clusters around the lens galaxy play an important role in the lensing potential . the best way to test this hypothesis would be to obtain spectroscopy for galaxies in the field of the lens , to confirm the cluster(s ) and identify members , and to measure the centroid and velocity dispersion of the cluster(s ) .",
    "those quantities could be used to estimate the shear from the environment , and compared with the predicted shear strength @xmath940.2 and orientation @xmath95@xmath96 to test and further constrain the lens models .",
    "we have identified a lensed quasar candidate , sdss  j0903 + 5028 , based on the superposition of a @xmath34 quasar and a @xmath1 luminous red galaxy in an sdss spectrum .",
    "follow - up observations with the arc 3.5-m and the keck ii telescope have confirmed that this is a two - image gravitational lens system , with image angular separation of 28 .",
    "the lens model is consistent with a massive galaxy with a velocity dispersion of 250 km sec@xmath89 .",
    "the lens geometry indicates a quadrupolar lensing potential which can be generated by an elliptical galaxy mass distribution and/or tidal shear from what appears to be a group of galaxies surrounding the lens .",
    "the misalignment between the quadrupole and the galaxy light suggests that there is indeed significant shear from the environment .",
