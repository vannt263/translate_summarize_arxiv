    "this characteristic feature is called the wiedemann - franz ( wf ) law  @xcite and has been observed in various electron systems  kearney , castellani , chester , smrcka , ong which may be described by the fermi liquid theory . a violation of the wf law implies the breakdown of the fermi liquid description of the electronic states in a metal .",

    "a validity of the fermi liquid picture in cuprates is an open question even now .",
    "the heat and charge currents are also important characteristics of a superconducting state .",
    "thermal conductivity of a bulk superconductor was first discussed theoretically by bardeen et al .",
    "large amount of work was done on thermal and electric transport in contacts between normal and superconducting phases ( n / s junctions ) . in the pioneering work by andreev",
    "@xcite a new type of quasiparticle scattering at the n / s interface was discovered , the so - called andreev reflection ( ar ) , which crucially influences quasiparticle transport across the interface at subgap energies .",
    "the ar causes the exponential decay of a thermal conductance across the n / s interface with decreasing temperature andreev , while it facilitates the transfer of an electric charge  btk .",

    "the quasiclassical green s function theory  @xcite has been widely used because of its convenience and broad applicability .",

    "the nazarov s boundary conditions coincide with the kl boundary conditions when transmission coefficients are sufficiently low , while the btk theory @xcite is reproduced in the ballistic regime .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) in low transparent n / s junctions transforms to a zero bias conductance dip ( zbcd ) with increasing the interface transparency .",

    "these results also suggest that thermal conductivity is sensitive to a pairing symmetry of an unconventional superconductor  graf2 . on the other hand , heat transport in n / s junctions",
