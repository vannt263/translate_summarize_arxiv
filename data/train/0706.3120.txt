    "high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions provide the means of creating nuclear matter in conditions of extreme temperature and density . in particular , the system undergoes a transition from a state of nucleons containing bound quarks and gluons to a state of deconfined quarks and gluons .",
    "this state was originally given the name quark gluon plasma .",
    "however , the results at rhic indicate that instead of behaving like a weakly coupled gas of free quarks and gluons , the matter created in heavy ion collisions behaves like a strongly coupled liquid .",
    "thus , there is a need for new approaches to strongly coupled gauge theories .    until recently , the lattice formulation was a unique theoretical tool to deal with strongly coupled gauge theories .",
    "the subject has taken an interesting turn with maldacena duality @xcite .",
    "one of the implications is that it resumed interest in finding a string description of strong interactions .",
    "although the original proposal was for conformal theories , various modifications have been found that produce gauge / string duals with a mass gap , confinement , and supersymmetry breaking @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address some issues of thermodynamics of @xmath0 pure gauge theory in a dual formulation .",
    "clearly , finding the dual from first principles of string theory is beyond of our ability .",
    "instead , we attempt the inverse problem and use our knowledge of some phenomenologically successful five - dimensional models of ads / qcd .    before proceeding to the detailed analysis ,",
    "let us set the basic framework .",
    "we consider the following ansatz for the 10-dimensional background geometry which turns out to be applicable for the temperature range @xmath1    @xmath3    here @xmath4 .",
    "it is a deformed product of the euclidean @xmath5 black hole and a 5-dimensional sphere ( compact space ) whose coordinates are @xmath6 .",
    "the deformation is due to a @xmath7-dependent factor @xmath8 .",
    "such a deformation is crucial for breaking conformal invariance of the original supergravity solution and introducing @xmath9 .",
    "apart from the language of 10-dimensional string theory , there is a more phenomenological way to attack qcd .",
    "this approach called ads / qcd deals with a five - dimensional effective description and tries to fit it to qcd as much as possible . for our model , its ads",
    "/ qcd cousin can be obtained by discarding the compact space in .    at @xmath10 , then what we get is the slightly deformed @xmath5 metric . such a deformation is notable .",
    "the point is that in this background linearized yang - mills equations are effectively reduced to a laguerre differential equation . as a result",
    ", the spectrum turns out to be like that of the linear regge models @xcite .",
    "this fact allows one to fix the value of @xmath11 from the @xmath12 meson trajectory .",
    "it is of order @xcite    @xmath13    we will assume that the value of @xmath11 is universal and is therefore valid for the world without quarks too .",
    "in addition , this ads / qcd model provides the phenomenologically acceptable heavy quark potentials as well as the value of the gluon condensate @xcite .    at finite @xmath14 ,",
    "the model provides the spatial string tension of pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the lattice data is very good for temperatures lower than @xmath15-@xmath16 .",
    "due to this reason we set the upper bound on @xmath14 in .",
    "moreover , the model describes in a qualitative way a heavy quark - antiquark pair and the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "thus , there are reasons to believe that the model is a good approximation for a string dual to a pure gauge theory .",
    "one of the bedrocks of gauge / string ( gravity ) duality is a conjecture that the entropy of gauge theories is equal to the bekenstein - hawking entropy of their string ( gravity ) duals @xcite .",
    "as known , the bekenstein - hawking entropy is proportional to an ( 8-dimensional ) area of the horizon .",
    "we can now ask whether the five - dimensional framework ( ads / qcd ) is an adequate approximation at this point . in general , the answer is no . there is a contribution from the compact space that might be relevant .",
    "the metric has the horizon at @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of the entropy density is    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is a factor independent of temperature . in this formula @xmath20",
    "is given by can be thought as a critical temperature . ]",
    "@xmath21    it follows from that the entropy density can be represented as a series in powers of @xmath22 with the leading @xmath23 term    @xmath24    where @xmath25 .    for future use",
    ", we define the truncated model by keeping the two leading terms in .",
    "we have    @xmath26        recently , it has been suggested by pisarski that for the temperature range @xmath27 the pressure in qcd with quarks is given by a series in powers of @xmath22 times the ideal @xmath28 term @xcite .",
    "explicitly ,    @xmath29    it was called a fuzzy bag model for the pressure .",
    "so , @xmath30 stands for the mit bag constant .",
    "@xmath31 is close to a critical temperature @xmath20 ( or some approximate @xmath32 for a crossover ) .",
    "a small difference between @xmath20 and @xmath31 may vary with the model .",
    "@xmath33 is set by perturbation theory such that it is applicable only for temperatures higher than @xmath33 .    for pure glue ,",
    "pisarski argued , based on lattice simulations of @xcite , that reduces to    @xmath34    this means that @xmath35 and @xmath30 is much smaller than the first two terms .",
    "so , the pressure is a sum of just two pieces .",
    "note that an important consequence of is that the pressure ( nearly ) vanishes at @xmath36 .",
    "given the entropy density as a function of @xmath14 , in the homogeneous case one can find the temperature dependence of the pressure by integrating @xmath37 . from",
    ", we get    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is an integration constant and @xmath40 .    the final topic to be considered here",
    "is whether the proposal of pisarski is reasonable in the model under consideration .",
    "the two leading terms in look similar to those of .",
    "so , we find that the critical temperature is given by @xmath20 .",
    "a simple estimate then gives    @xmath41    in su(3 ) pure gauge theory the critical temperature is of order @xmath42 mev .",
    "so , the agreement is not bad at this point .",
    "let us now use @xmath43 to determine the integration constant . as a result ,",
    "we have    @xmath44    the value of @xmath39 is indeed small compared to the coefficients in front of the two leading terms .",
    "thus , the agreement is very satisfactory at this point .    to complete the picture , we present the results of numerical calculations .",
    "we split the series into two pieces , the first containing the two leading terms , and the second presenting the rest .",
    "then we define times @xmath45 . ]",
    "@xmath46    for the sake of simplicity , we have omitted the overall factor @xmath45 .",
    "the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be read off of fig.1 .",
    "we see that at @xmath49 the value of @xmath48 is one order of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath47 . above @xmath50 the value of @xmath47 increases , while @xmath48 decreases and becomes negligible for @xmath51 .",
    "thus , @xmath52 provides a reliable approximation whose error is less then 10% for the pressure .    in sum ,",
    "the truncated model which is equivalent to the proposal of pisarski is valid with accuracy better than @xmath53 .",
    "having derived the entropy density , we can easily obtain the speed of sound .",
    "for the model of interest , we have    @xmath54    for completeness , we also present the result obtained for the truncated model . in this case",
    "is replaced by    @xmath55    note that @xmath56 is independent of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we do not have any free fitting parameter at this point .",
    "we close the discussion of the speed of sound by comparing the results with those of lattice simulations .",
    "the curves are shown in fig.2 .        from the figure",
    "we can see that the model of interest is in very good agreement with the lattice for @xmath57 , while near @xmath50 the discrepancy is of order @xmath58 percent .",
    "the agreement between the truncated model and the lattice is spectacular .",
    "the maximum discrepancy occurred at @xmath59 is of order @xmath60 percent .",
    "we will next describe the gluon condensate at finite temperature . except those coming from lattice simulations . ]",
    "it is obtained from the trace anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "we have    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the condensate at zero temperature .    unlike the speed of sound , the condensate depends on the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "there are two different ways to fix its value which fortunately yield very similar results .",
    "the first is to fit the interaction measure @xmath63 as it follows from and to the lattice data of @xcite at some normalization point @xmath64 . as result",
    ", we get    @xmath65    at first glance it may seem curious that the result is almost independent of the normalization point . as we will see in a moment , this is indeed the case .",
    "the second is to match the coefficient in front of the @xmath28 term in with that of the bag model @xcite . for @xmath2 ( pure ) gauge theory ,",
    "the latter is simply @xmath66 . at @xmath67",
    ", we find    @xmath68    that is really the same as .",
    "having determined the value of @xmath19 , we can now write down the expression for the condensate . combining , and and , we get    @xmath69    where @xmath70 . note that the condensate at zero temperature @xmath71 has been included in the @xmath72 term . for the background geometry , the estimate of @xcite gives @xmath73 .",
    "interestingly , the value of @xmath74 turns out to be small .",
    "for @xmath75 it is of order @xmath76 .    in fig.3",
    "we have plotted the gluon condensate in units of @xmath77 as a function of the ratio @xmath78 .",
    "we conclude the discussion with a couple of comments : ( i ) the expression for the gluon condensate is cumbersome and difficult of any practical use .",
    "we should therefore seek a simpler ( nearly equal ) expression .",
    "what we already know is that the truncated model is a good approximation for the pressure and the speed of sound .",
    "so , it is reasonable to use this option",
    ". we can check it by the same arguments that we used in the case of the pressure . to this end , we split the series into two pieces and define    @xmath79    for simplicity , we have omitted the overall factor @xmath80 .",
    "the values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be read off of fig.4 .",
    "we see that the value of @xmath82 is approximately @xmath83 of @xmath81 . thus , in the temperature range under consideration we may approximate the infinite series by @xmath81 .",
    "finally , the gluon condensate takes the form predicted by the truncated model    @xmath84    \\(ii ) using and , one can easily find the expression for the interaction measure .",
    "it is    @xmath85    the truncated model provides a simpler expression of the measure    @xmath86    as expected .    in fig.5 we have plotted the interaction measure as a function of the ratio @xmath78 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the agreement with the lattice data is very satisfactory .",
    "an important observation is that varying @xmath19 over the range has a little effect .",
    "\\(i ) the model we have proposed predicts the entropy density as a series in @xmath22 .",
    "it differs from the proposal of pisarski @xcite by having a term @xmath87 in the pressure .",
    "however , in the pure glue case the @xmath87 term turns out to be subdominant .        where @xmath89 is the string tension at zero temperature .",
    "then , from , we see that the spatial tension can be written as a series in powers of @xmath22 times @xmath90 . note that unlike the cases considered in section 2 the first two terms of the series do not provide a reasonable approximation .",
    "\\(iii ) can one think of the model as a string dual to a @xmath2 pure gauge theory ?",
    "we will be exploring the consequences of assuming that the pressure vanishes at @xmath36 .",
    "is now dependent of @xmath91 , so is not applicable . ]",
    "thus our model predicts that the ratio is a function of @xmath78 .. ] it does not explicitly depend on @xmath91 . at this point",
    "it is worth noting that in addition to @xmath67 the prediction is also supported by lattice simulations for @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xcite .                for @xmath67",
    ", @xmath102 is approximately equal to @xmath107 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this value with the estimate of @xcite .",
    "the latter was made by using the cornell potential .",
    "the result is @xmath108 .",
    "the estimates are relatively close .",
    "this might be a hint that @xmath102 is also a slowly varying function of a number of quarks .",
