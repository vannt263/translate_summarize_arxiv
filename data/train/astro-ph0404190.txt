    "axisymmetric instabilities in models of disc galaxies have been investigated extensively in the last century ( e.g. , safronov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ; bertin & lin 1996 ) . for a single disc of either gaseous or stellar content , safronov ( 1960 ) and toomre ( 1964 ) originally introduced a dimensionless @xmath6 parameter to determine the local stability condition ( i.e. @xmath7 ) against axisymmetric ring - like disturbances in the usual wentzel - kramers - brillouin - jeffreys ( wkbj ) or tight - winding approximation .",
    "a more realistic model of a disc galaxy would involve both gas and stars as well as an unseen massive dark matter halo , all interacting among themselves through the mutual gravitation .",
    "many theoretical investigations have been conducted along this track for a composite system of two coupled discs ( lin & shu 1966 ; kato 1972 ; jog & solomon 1984a , b ; bertin & romeo 1988 ; romeo 1992 ; elmegreen 1995 ; jog 1996 ; lou & fan 1998b ) . in these earlier treatments , either an approach of combined distribution function and fluid or the formalism of two fluids have been adopted in a wkbj modal analysis .",
    "while these model results were initially derived in various galactic contexts , they can be applied or adapted also to , with proper qualifications , relevant self - gravitating disc systems including accretion discs in general , circumnuclear discs , protostellar discs , planetary discs and so forth .    the local wkbj or tight - winding approximation has been proven to be a powerful technique in analysing disc wave dynamics .",
    "meanwhile , theorists have long been keenly interested in a class of relatively simple disc models referred to as scale - free discs ( mestel 1963 ; zang 1976 ; lemos et al . 1991 ; lynden - bell & lemos 1993 ; syer & tremaine 1996 ; evans & read 1998 ; goodman & evans 1999 ; shu et al .",

    "scale - free discs , where all pertinent physical variables ( e.g. , disc rotation speed , surface mass density , angular speed etc . ) scale as powers of cylindrical radius @xmath0 , have become one effective and simple vehicle to explore disc dynamics . perhaps , the most familiar case is the so - called singular isothermal discs ( sids ) or mestel discs with an isothermal equation of state and flat rotation curves ( mestel 1963 ; zang 1976 ; goodman & evans 1999 ; shu et al .",
    "2000 ; lou 2002 ; lou & shen 2003 ; lou & zou 2004 ) .",
    "in contrast to the usual wkbj approximation for perturbations , perturbations in axisymmetric scale - free discs can be treated , in some cases , globally and exactly without the local restriction ( i.e. , valid only in the short - wavelength regime ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to derive global properties of perturbations . using scale - free disc models , lemos et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and syer & tremaine ( 1996 ) both studied the axisymmetric stability problem for a single disc and found that instabilities first set in as neutral modes or stationary configurations with angular frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to examine the global axisymmetric stability problem in a composite system of two gravitationally coupled scale - free discs . as a more general extension to the previous two - sid analysis ( lou & shen 2003 ; shen & lou 2003 ) , we further consider a much broader class of rotation curves as well as the equation of state .",
    "this contribution gives an explicit proof that stationary configurations ( @xmath1 ) do mark the marginal stability in the two - fluid system , a cogent supplement to our recent investigation on stationary perturbation configurations ( shen & lou 2004 ) .",
    "as an expedient approximation , we treat both discs as razor - thin discs and use either superscripts or subscripts @xmath8 and @xmath9 to indicate physical variables with stellar and gaseous disc associations , respectively .",
    "the large - scale coupling between the two discs is primarily caused by the mutual gravitational interaction . in the present formulation of large - scale perturbations ,",
    "we ignore non - ideal diffusive effects such as viscosity , resistivity and thermal conduction , etc .",
    "it is then straightforward to write down the basic coplanar fluid equation set for the stellar disc in cylindrical coordinates @xmath10 within the @xmath11 plane , namely @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the surface mass density , @xmath16 is the radial bulk flow velocity , @xmath17 is the specific angular momentum about the rotation axis along @xmath18direction , @xmath19 is the vertically integrated effective ( two - dimensional ) pressure due to stellar velocity dispersion and @xmath20 is the _ total _ gravitational potential . for the gaseous disc , we simply replace superscript or subscript @xmath8 by @xmath9 in the above three equations .",

    "the barotropic equation of state assumes the relation between two - dimensional pressure and surface mass density in the form of @xmath23 where coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constant .",
    "this directly leads to the sound speed @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 which scales as @xmath28 .",
    "the case of @xmath29 corresponds to an isothermal sound speed @xmath26 .    from the basic fluid equations for stellar and gaseous discs above ( the latter",
    "are not written out explicitly ) , we may derive the axisymmetric equilibrium background properties ( shen & lou 2004 ) .",
    "we presume that in the equilibrium background of axisymmetry , both rotation curves of the two discs scale as @xmath30 and both surface mass densities of the two discs scale as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are two constant exponents and the proportional coefficients are allowed to be different in general . by assuming the same power - law indices for the stellar and gaseous disc rotation curves ( or equivalently the surface mass densities ) , it is possible to consistently construct a global axisymmetric background equilibrium for the composite disc system that meets the requirement of radial force balance at all radii [ see equation ( 2 ) and the corresponding equation with the superscript @xmath8 replaced by @xmath9 ] and satisfies the poisson integral ( 4 ) simultaneously .",
    "the scale - free condition requires the following relationship among @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath35 ( see syer & tremaine 1996 and shen & lou 2004 ) , namely @xmath36 once the rotation curve is specified , all other physical variables are simultaneously determined .    with the knowledge of computing a gravitational potential arising from an axisymmetric power - law surface mass density for the background rotational equilibrium ( kalnajs 1971 ; qian 1992 ; syer & tremaine 1996 )",

    "we note that the value of @xmath44 falls within @xmath45 for the prescribed range is determined by ( 1 ) barotropic index @xmath25 for warm discs , ( 2 ) surface mass density exponent @xmath46 so that the central point mass does not diverge , and ( 3 ) this @xmath33 range is contained within a wider range of @xmath47 ( for a cold disc system ) when the computed force arising from the background potential remains finite ( syer & tremaine 1996 ) . ] of @xmath48 and is equal to 1 when @xmath49 ( i.e. , the case of two gravitationally coupled sids ) .    from the radial force balance of the background equilibrium , there also exists a relation such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is another handy dimensionless parameter for sound speed ratio squared .",

    "effective sound speed [ scaled by a factor @xmath53 and the parameter @xmath54 where @xmath52 is the reduced disc rotation speed , is the effective mach number [ see eqns ( [ j0])@xmath55([soundspeed ] ) later ] .",

    "else if @xmath122 but with @xmath117 , we again have @xmath132 for instabilities .",
    "only when @xmath122 and @xmath133 at the same time can the composite disc system be stable against axisymmetric coplanar perturbations .",
    "this is an important necessary stability criterion for a composite system of two gravitationally coupled discs . in other words , once one disc is unstable by itself ( i.e. , @xmath134 or @xmath135 or both ) , the two - disc system must be unstable ; even if the two discs are both separately stable , the composite disc system can still become unstable ( i.e. , @xmath100 and @xmath101 but @xmath117 ) .    by inserting expressions of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 into the marginal stability condition ( [ marstacon ] ) together with requirements of the background rotational equilibrium , we readily derive a quadratic equation in terms of @xmath136 , namely @xmath137 where the coefficients are explicitly defined by @xmath138\\eta\\\\ & -\\frac{({\\cal a}_0+{\\cal b}_0 ) ( { \\cal h}_0+{\\cal b}_0\\delta)}{(1+\\delta ) } \\ , \\\\",

    "typically , there exist two different regimes bounded by the marginal @xmath3 stability curves that are unstable against axisymmetric perturbations , that is , the collapse regime for long - wavelength perturbations and the ring - fragmentation regime for short - wavelength perturbations .",
    "in contrast to the short - wavelength wkbj approximation , the collapse regime is novel and exact . systems with too fast a rotation parameter @xmath3 will fall into the ring - fragmentation regime ( safronov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ; syer & tremaine 1996 ; lou & fan 1998a , b ; shu et al .",
    "2000 ; lou 2002 ; lou & shen 2003 , 2004 ; shen & lou 2003 ) , while those with too slow a @xmath3 parameter will fall into the collapse regime . shown in fig .",
    "1 is an example of illustration with @xmath140 , @xmath141 and an unconstrained @xmath4 .",
    "we note that cases with @xmath141 are essentially the same as those of a single disc ( shen & lou 2004 ) . the boundaries of the two regimes of instabilities shown in fig .",
    "1 vary with different parameters @xmath56 and @xmath4 for chosen values of @xmath33 that describes the entire scale - free radial profile of a composite disc system ( i.e. , disc rotation curves , surface mass densities and barotropic equation of state ) .",
    "qualitatively , the increase of either @xmath5 and @xmath4 will aggravate the ring - fragmentation instability while suppress the large - scale collapse instability ( shen & lou 2003 ) .",
    "while this can be directly seen from equation ( [ quadratic ] ) in the relevant parameter regimes , it can also be understood physically in terms of the dynamical coupling between the two discs through condition ( [ adeqn ] ) constrained by scale - free conditions . for a larger @xmath5 , the reduced gas disc rotation speed @xmath142 will exceed the reduced stellar disc rotation speed @xmath143 by a larger margin and this tend to prevent an overall collapse of a composite disc system .",
    "in other words , a gaseous disc component with a relatively lower sound speed seems to prevent a collapse ( shen & lou 2003 ) .",
    "more details and examples can be found in shen & lou ( 2004 ) .",
    "it is well known that a @xmath6 parameter can be defined to determine local axisymmetric stability of a single - disc system ( safronov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) . for a composite disc system",
    ", it has been attempted to introduce an effective @xmath144 parameter ( elmegreen 1995 ; jog 1996 ; lou & fan 1998b ) . as a result of straightforward numerical computations ,",
    "we have recently introduced a powerful @xmath2criterion for axisymmetric stability of a composite system of two coupled sids ( shen & lou 2003 ) .",
    "it is natural to further generalize this @xmath2criterion for axisymmetric stability of a composite system of two coupled barotropic discs by straightforward numerical computations as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the present case , it is more practical and simple to use @xmath3 parameter .",
    "0.2 cm          from observations of more or less flat rotation curves of most disc galaxies , massive dark matter halos have been inferred to exist ubiquitously as long as the newtonian gravity remains valid on galactic scales .",
    "if we naively attempt to relate theoretical results obtained in section 2.2 to a typical disc galaxy , we may take the simple isothermal equation of state as an example of illustration .",
    "the relevant parameters for a composite sid system are then chosen as @xmath145 and @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "unfortunately , such a composite system of two coupled sids is inevitably unstable against ring - fragmentation perturbations because of a @xmath150 , far exceeding the maximum value necessary for being stable against ring fragmentations .",
    "this dilemma can be resolved by attributing to an additional gravitational potential associated with an unseen massive dark matter halo .",
    "we refer to a composite disc system in association with an axisymmetric dark matter halo as a composite system of _ partial discs _",
    "( e.g. syer & tremaine 1996 ; shu et al .",
    "2000 ; lou 2002 ; lou & fan 2002 ; shen & lou 2003 , 2004 ) . in a simple treatment , the dynamical effect of a dark matter halo",
    "is modeled as only to contribute an axisymmetric gravitational potential @xmath151 in the background rotational equilibrium but not to respond to coplanar perturbations in the composite disc system .",
    "with @xmath152 , we conveniently introduce a dimensionless parameter @xmath153 as the ratio of the potential arising from the composite disc system to that of the entire system including the presumed axisymmetric dark matter halo .",
    "the full - disc system corresponds to @xmath154 ( i.e. @xmath155 ) and the partial - disc system corresponds to @xmath156 ( i.e. , @xmath157 ) . for a composite system of two",
    "gravitationally coupled partial discs , we follow the same procedure of analysing coplanar perturbations in full discs to derive a similar quadratic equation of @xmath3 as the stationary dispersion relation . in a nutshell , we can simply replace all @xmath105 in our theoretical results by @xmath158 to accomplish this generalization or extension .",
    "the introduction of the ratio parameter @xmath159 will significantly reduce both the ring - fragmentation regime and the collapse regime , as already can be seen from a comparative study of the wkbj and global approaches ( shen & lou 2003 ) .    for the purpose of illustrating the stabilizing effect of a partial - disc system , we simply take @xmath160 with other parameters used earlier in this section .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath3 for unstable ring fragmentations now becomes @xmath161 , far beyond the actual value of @xmath150 in a disc galaxy .",
    "meanwhile , the collapse regime completely disappears .",
    "therefore , a typical composite system of two coupled partial discd is fairly stable against axisymmetric coplanar perturbations .",
    "the main thrust of this investigation is to model linear coplanar perturbations of axisymmetry ( @xmath80 ) in a composite system of two - fluid scale - free discs with one intended for a stellar disc and the other intended for a gaseous disc .",
    "the two discs are dynamically coupled through the mutual gravitational interaction . in order to include the dynamical effect of a massive dark matter halo with axisymmetry , we further describe a composite system of two coupled partial discs ( e.g. syer & tremaine 1996 ; shu et al . 2000 ; lou 2002 ; lou & shen 2003 ; lou & zou 2004 ; lou & wu 2004 ) . in a global perturbation analysis , we show that axisymmetric instabilities set in as stationary perturbation configurations with @xmath1 .",
    "the marginal @xmath3 stability curves ( characterized by the stationary configurations ) delineate two different unstable regimes , namely , the collapse regime for large - scale perturbations and the ring - fragmentation regime for short - wavelength perturbations .",
    "apparently , the composite disc system becomes less stable than a single - disc system and can be unstable with the two discs being stable separately ( lou & fan 1998b ) . in our analysis ,",
    "stationary perturbation configurations turn out to be more than just an alternative equilibrium state , especially in view of the stability properties .",
    "the basic results of this paper are generally applicable to self - gravitating disc systems with or without axisymmetric dark matter halos .",
    "the two - fluid treatment contains more realistic elements than a single - disc formulation in the context of disc galaxies .",
    "in addition to astrophysical applications to disc galaxies , the studies presented here can be valuable for exploring the dynamical evolution of protostellar discs and circumnuclear discs .    in the context of a proto - stellar disc",
    ", it is the usual case to ignore the self - gravity effect . by considering the self - gravity of a composite disc system",
    ", our analysis indicates several qualitative yet interesting results .",
    "for example , if the initial disc system rotates sufficiently fast , the ring fragmentation ( see the upper - right part of fig .",
    "1 ) can occur at relatively small radial scales . by further non - axisymmetric fragmentations ,",
    "these condensed rings of materials may eventually become birthplaces of planets . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial disc system rotates sufficiently slow , then gravitational collapse can be induced by perturbations of relatively large radial scales ( see the lower left corner of fig .",
    "once such a perturbation develops in the background equilibrium disc , it grows rapidly and destabilizes the disc .",
    "subsequently , the system undergoes global jeans collapse to form a central young stellar object .",
    "finally , if the initial disc system rotates in a regime stable against all axisymmetric perturbations ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , there might be two possibilities : ( 1 ) the composite disc system might become unstable caused by non - axisymmetric perturbations ( not analyzed here ) and ( 2 ) the disc rotation may be gradually slowed down by some braking mechanisms ( e.g. magnetic field not included here and outflows or winds ) and the disc eventually succumbs to a central collapse induced by large - scale perturbations .    likewise , in the context of a circumnuclear disc around the center of a galaxy , we can readily conceive similar physical processes in parallel .",
    "one important distinction is that a dark - matter halo should play an important dynamical role so that a formulation of a partial composite disc system would be more appropriate . here",
    ", the ring fragmentation can be induced by relatively small - scale perturbations in a disc system of sufficiently fast rotation .",
    "such a ring of relatively dense materials around the galactic center would be a natural birthplace for circumnuclear starburst activities ( e.g. lou et al .",
    "depending on the evolution history of a circumnuclear disc system , it may be stable initially and gradually lose angular momentum by generating and damping spiral magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) density waves ( lou et al .",
    "when the disc rotation becomes sufficiently slow , jeans collapse induced by large - scale perturbations can set in to form a bulge or a supermassive black hole .    in summary ,",
    "our global analysis shows the possible presence of an evolution stage for a composite disc system against all axisymmetric coplanar perturbations .",
    "more importantly , we reveal the parameter regime of ring fragmentation and the parameter regime of large - scale collapse .",
    "astrophysical applications are discussed in the contexts of disc galaxies , proto - stellar discs and circumnuclear disks .",

    "<S> the composite system will collapse if it rotates too slowly and will succumb to ring - fragmentation instabilities if it rotates sufficiently fast . </S>",
    "<S> the overall stable range for axisymmetric perturbations is determined by a necessary @xmath2criterion involving of the effective mach number squared @xmath3 ( i.e. , the square ratio of the stellar disc rotation speed to the stellar velocity dispersion but scaled by a numerical factor ) . </S>",
    "<S> different mass ratio @xmath4 and sound speed ratio @xmath5 of the gaseous and stellar disc components will alter the overall stability . for spiral galaxies or circumnuclear discs , we further include the dynamical effect of a massive dark matter halo . </S>",
    "<S> as examples , astrophysical applications to disc galaxies , proto - stellar discs and circumnuclear discs are discussed . </S>"
