    "it is a remarkable fact that planets start out as microscopic grains within the protoplanetary disks of gas and dust in orbit around newly - formed protostars , somehow growing roughly @xmath0 orders of magnitude in mass in a period no more than @xmath1 years corresponding to disk lifetimes @xcite .",
    "there is no one physical process that can explain growth over this enormous range of sizes : the very smallest grains ( micron to millimeter sizes ) can grow via collisional agglomeration in which the sticking mechanism is electrostatic in nature ; whereas , on the other end of the size spectrum , objects in the kilometer to tens of kilometers regime can grow via gravity - enhanced collisions @xcite .",
    "the least understood stage of growth is how millimeter - size particles grow to kilometer - size ; grains in this regime are too large for sticking via electrostatic forces , yet far too small to have any significant self - gravity . even more problematic",
    "is the fact that particles in this intermediate - size regime are strongly affected by aerodynamic drag of the surrounding gas : meter - size objects , for example , have radial drift speeds on the order of @xmath2  cm / s at 1  au and thus spiral inward onto the protostar on the timescale of a few hundred years @xcite .",
    "whatever process is responsible for grain growth through this range of sizes must act on timescales faster than this inspiral time if any raw materials are to be available to build protoplanets .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed that a very thin , very dense sheet of settled dust in the midplane of the protoplanetary disk might be be gravitationally unstable ; the nonlinear evolution would result in the layer clumping - up directly into gravitationally - bound kilometer - size planetesimals on a timescale of order the orbital period . according to this scenario",
    ", there is a direct jump from small particles to kilometer - size planetesimals without growing slowly through the intermediate sizes which have very short orbital decay timescales . as attractive",
    "as this mechanism is for planetesimal formation , a significant obstacle is turbulence which can stir and mix the dust with the gas and prevent the dust layer from settling into a thin enough , dense enough sheet for the gravitational instability to operate @xcite .    even in the absence of any mechanism to drive turbulence ,",
    "the settling of the dust particles into a thin sublayer in an initially laminar midplane would create a vertical shear that might be unstable to kelvin - helmholtz instability . because of a relatively weak outward radial pressure gradient , pure gas in a protoplanetary disk orbits the protostar at a rate slightly slower than true keplerian : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 for typical conditions at 1  au @xcite .",
    "pure dust , in the absence of any gas , would orbit exactly at the keplerian rate .",
    "one can show that in the limit of perfect dust - gas coupling , the orbital velocity of a mixture of gas and dust is a function of the local dust - to - gas ratio @xcite ; as dust settles into the midplane , the dust - rich gas in the midplane orbits faster than the dust - depleted gas above and below the midplane .",
    "two - fluid ( gas and dust ) numerical simulations by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggested that turbulent diffusion would prevent settling of grains into thin enough sheets for gravitational instability .",
    "the onset of kelvin - helmholtz instability is determined by a competition between the stabilizing effects of stratification and the destabilizing effects of vertical shear .",
    "if there is no rotation and no horizontal shear , then a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for instability is the richardson number criterion @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the brunt - visl frequency ( the frequency of buoyant oscillations of a stably - stratified medium ) and @xmath7 is the vertical shear .",
    "the critical richardson number of one - quarter corresponds to a state in which the kinetic energy of the vertical shear is sufficient to lift the heavier gas out of the gravitationally potential well and remix it with the lighter overlying fluid . assuming that dust would settle into thinner and thinner layers down to the limit set by the classic richardson criterion",
    ", @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite determined critical vertical quasi - equilibrium dust profiles and investigated the conditions necessary for such layers to be gravitationally unstable .",
    "@xcite pursued two - fluid linear calculations ( without rotation and radial shear ) of dust sedimentation into sheets and found that the kelvin - helmholtz instability was excited before gravitational instability unless the global dust - to - gas ratio was greatly enhanced over solar abundance .",
    "@xcite suggested that such enhancements might be attainable because the inward drift speed decreases as particles migrate inward , resulting in `` particle pile - ups . ''",
    "it is not at all clear whether the classic richardson number criterion is appropriate for the kelvin - helmholtz instability in protoplanetary disks in which both rotation and radial shear could significantly affect the onset of instability as well as alter the nonlinear evolution of any instability that develops .",
    "@xcite pursued a purely linear analysis to study the effect of radial shear on the time evolution of unstable kelvin - helmholtz modes and showed that the modes were sheared to higher spatial wavenumber and could eventually be stabilized .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite investigated the effects of the coriolis force on the onset of instability , and found that settled layers were unstable at much higher richardson numbers ( corresponding to thicker dust layers ) than in the classic case .",
    "however , these simulations were two - dimensional and did not include the radial shear .",
    "the motivation for this work is to investigate the apparently opposing influences of rotation ( destabilizing ) and radial shear ( stabilizing ) on the kelvin - helmholtz instability of settled dust layers and resolve whether or not such layers can ever reach the thin enough , dense enough conditions for the onset of gravitational instability .",
    "apart from the impact of kelvin - helmholtz instability on the formation of planetesimals , it is important to determine the vertical distribution of dust in order to correctly interpret observations @xcite .",
    "the approach we take here is that the dust is perfectly coupled to the gas ; in terms of timescales , the friction or stopping time ( see ( [ e : epstein ] ) below ) is much shorter than the evolution of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities if they are present .",
    "we will not simulate the formation of the dust layer from a well - mixed state , but assume that the layers have already formed with a given profile of the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "if the layer turns out to be unstable on a fast timescale , it implies that such a layer would never have formed in the first place . in  2 , we present equations for the hydrodynamic evolution of settled dust layers in the limit of perfect dust - gas coupling . in  3",
    ", we revisit the cases of ( i ) no rotation , no shear , and ( ii ) rotation , no shear . in  4 ,",
    "we present new three - dimensional simulations of the evolution of settled dust layers with both rotation and shear .",
    "finally , in  5 , we discuss the impact of these results on the planetesimal formation via gravitational instability .",
    "consider the time - independent , axisymmetric azimuthal flow @xmath8 of gas around a protostar of mass @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are protostar - centered cylindrical coordinates with corresponding unit vectors @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the gravitational potential , @xmath14 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the equilibrium gas density and pressure .",

    "when kelvin - helmholtz instabilities do develop , the horizontal and vertical scales of the fastest growing unstable modes are typically of order the thickness of the shear layer : @xmath33",

    "this approximation is valid if the stopping time @xmath55 ( the @xmath56-folding time for a particle s velocity to match that of the surrounding medium because of frictional coupling ) is much shorter than the timescales of interest for kelvin - helmholtz instability . for small particles for which the gas mean - free - path is larger than the size of the particles",

    "the time integration scheme is overall globally second - order accurate . unlike finite - difference methods , spectral methods have no inherent grid dissipation ; energy cascades to smaller and smaller size scales via the nonlinear interactions , where it can `` pile - up '' and potentially degrade the convergence of the spectral expansions .",

    "wall - clock time scales inversely with number of processors , indicating near - optimal parallelism ; timing analyses are presented in @xcite .",
    "the linear stability of settled dust layers to kelvin - helmholtz instability has previously been investigated by a number of researchers @xcite ; however , almost all of these analyses neglected the role of the differential rotation in the protoplanetary disk . if one were to directly linearize the equations ( [ e : dynamic_equations ] ) , one would find the resulting set to depend linearly on the radial coordinate @xmath71 because of the shear , making it difficult to apply periodic boundary conditions in the radial direction .",
    "alternatively , one could employ a set of coordinates that advect with the background shear @xcite , but then the resulting linearized equations would explicitly depend on time .",
    "@xcite employed this approach using an initial - value code to address the effect of horizontal shear on unstable eigenmodes in the small - amplitude , linear regime .",
    "they found that modes grew for a limited period of time , but were eventually stabilized as they were sheared out to high spatial wavenumber .",
    "no matter the approach , the linear stability analysis is difficult to treat analytically , motivating theorists to tackle the problem without the background shear with the hope that the results are qualitatively , if not quantitatively , useful in determining whether or not the kelvin - helmholtz instability is a barrier to further settling .    in this section , we briefly revisit the case of no radial shear , first without , and then with the coriolis force .",

    "if turbulence lofts the particles throughout the disk , ionization can be suppressed , which will have the tendency to decouple the interior gas from the magnetic fields , allowing the dead zone to reform .",
    "dust particle could then re - settle , ionization could increase , re - coupling the gas to the fields and generating a new phase of turbulence .",
    "we plan to investigate if there is indeed a limit cycle to the formation and destruction of the dead zone in protoplanetary disks .",

    "<S> as dust settles in a protoplanetary disk , a vertical shear develops because the dust - rich gas in the midplane orbits at a rate closer to true keplerian than the slower - moving dust - depleted gas above and below . </S>",
    "<S> a classical analysis ( neglecting the coriolis force and differential rotation ) predicts that kelvin - helmholtz instability occurs when the richardson number of the stratified shear flow is below roughly one - quarter . </S>",
    "<S> however , earlier numerical studies showed that the coriolis force makes layers more unstable , whereas horizontal shear may stabilize the layers . </S>",
    "<S> simulations with a 3d spectral code were used to investigate these opposing influences on the instability in order to resolve whether such layers can ever reach the dense enough conditions for the onset of gravitational instability . </S>",
    "<S> i confirm that the coriolis force , in the absence of radial shear , does indeed make dust layers more unstable , however the instability sets in at high spatial wavenumber for thicker layers . </S>",
    "<S> when radial shear is introduced , the onset of instability depends on the amplitude of perturbations : small amplitude perturbations are sheared to high wavenumber where further growth is damped ; whereas larger amplitude perturbations grow to magnitudes that disrupt the dust layer . </S>",
    "<S> however , this critical amplitude decreases sharply for thinner , more unstable layers . in 3d simulations of unstable layers </S>",
    "<S> , turbulence mixes the dust and gas , creating thicker , more stable layers . </S>",
    "<S> i find that layers with minimum richardson numbers in the approximate range 0.2  0.4 are stable in simulations with horizontal shear . </S>"
