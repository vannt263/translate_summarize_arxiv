    "rapid population increase in developing countries is a hotly debated topic in demographic and socio - economic research , having immediate consequences on the increasing demand for facilities and social services , rising unemployment rates and reduced standard of living .",
    "although there is a still debated literature on the long - term effects of overpopulation in socio - economic growth [ @xcite , @xcite ] , in the view of developing countries limited resources , rapid population increase represents a key problem for the short - term development process and a main concern for governments policies .",
    "this is particularly true in india , where the coexistence of early marriages , high poverty rates , illiteracy and decline in infant mortality , favored a population growth rate of @xmath0 , double than china s",
    "@xmath1 @xcite , leading to an unsustainable population which is expected to stabilize around @xmath2 billion over the next quarter century .",
    "although india has been the first nation to introduce an official family planning program in 1951 @xcite , the promotion of contraceptive methods during the first and second five year plans in 1951 - 1956 and 1956 - 1961 @xcite and the later change of polices via large coercive sterilization programs @xcite under the rule of indira gandhi in the 1970 s and in early-1980 s , failed to properly address the rapid population growth issue .",
    "coercion - free contraception , broader reproductive health care and counseling services were later promoted after the international conference on population and developments in 1994 @xcite , but skepticism currently remains on the performance of such target - free methods , increasing the emphasis on the availability of strategic data to support and evaluate family planning policies . as a result , detailed census and household surveys such as the india human development survey ( ihds ) and the national family health survey ( nfhs ) have been recently conducted , motivating an increasing interest in the determinants of contraceptive use . in this work",
    "we aim to explore ihds survey data available at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/dsdr/studies/22626 to provide a flexible overview on this phenomenon .",
    "contraception plays a key role in family planning and the widely accepted association between contraceptive prevalence rates and total fertility rates @xcite motivates extensive demographic research on developing countries .",
    "model - based statistical analyses typically focus on classical logistic regression to understand the effect of demographic and socio - economic variables on the probability of using contraceptives [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "generalizations accounting for the multi - stage clustered sampling structure of the surveys investigated are available via multilevel logistic regression [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "these models consider normally distributed random effects for geographic areas within a classical generalized linear mixed model framework .",
    "although this class of models is appealing in allowing random variability among geographic areas , borrowing of information is quite sensitive to departures from normality assumption @xcite . beside this issue ,",
    "proposed models enforce parametric relations between the covariates and the response variable .",
    "figure [ motivating ] shows how such assumption could be overly - restrictive , while leading to misleading inferences .",
    "this is particularly true if one considers the empirical evidences in figure [ predictor ] .",
    "when aggregating the different contraceptive behaviors in one single binary variable encoding the presence or absence of contraceptive use , we expect two peaks in the functional relation between age and contraceptive use in women with one child , induced by the very different behavior of female sterilization with respect to other methods .",
    "introducing specific parameters for class of ages as in @xcite and @xcite improve flexibility , but questions remain on the number and location of the thresholds , which may lead to substantial different results .",
    "we generalize the above mentioned approaches in two substantially different directions in order to develop a fully flexible model - based approach to explore the determinants of contraceptive use in india .",
    "specifically we allow the functional effect of variable age entering the predictor via a nonparametric specification through gaussian process prior , and exploit the dirichlet process prior to enforce uncertainty in the distribution of the india s states - specific random intercepts , while favoring clustering effects .",
    "hence we are more closely related to the literature on functional data analysis with proposal covering semiparametric approaches via spline functions [ see e.g. , @xcite ] and nonparametric regression via gaussian processes @xcite . for a detailed review on bayesian nonparametric modeling via dp prior see @xcite .",
    "such models are widely used in machine learning , biostatistics and epidemiological applications , with recent growth of interest in demographic and social science settings [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "however , similar contributions analyzing the determinants of contraceptive use are lacking and researches focusing on india [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] are still overly - restrictive .",
    "we aim to cover this gap , while providing a general gibbs sampling algorithm for nonparametric logistic regression via gp priors and random effects distribution equipped with dp priors .",
    "our algorithm efficiently exploits the stick breaking representation of the dirichlet process @xcite and a recently developed data augmentation scheme for bayesian logistic regression @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 3",
    "we describe the ihds dataset .",
    "model formulation , prior specification and posterior computation are provided in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we consider a simulation study to evaluate model performance , while section 6 presents the results of our analysis on ihds contraceptive data .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in section 7 .",
    "the ihds 2005 is a nationally representative , multi - topic survey conducted on @xmath3 households over @xmath4 states of india , via a multi - stage clustered sampling design @xcite .",
    "the survey arises from the collaboration between the university of maryland and the national council of applied economic research ( ncaer ) in new delhi and is divided in different modules , aimed at monitoring a wide range of socio - economic behaviors .",
    "we focus our analysis on the module devoted to ever - married women providing informations about contraceptive use and other socio - economic variables .",
    "eligible units are women aged @xmath5 who have been married at least once in their lives although their current marital status may not be married , comprising a total sample of @xmath6 statistical units .",
    "the dependent variable is a binary indicator denoting whether the woman is currently using any methods to delay or prevent pregnancy at the time of interview , while covariates of interest have been selected consistently with evidences in previous works on developing countries [ see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "specifically we consider age ( ` age ` ) , a binary variable ( ` area ` ) indicating whether the woman lives in urban ( ` area`=1 ) or rural areas ( ` area`=0 ) , a three level factor ( ` relig ` ) encoding hindu ( ` relig`=0 ) , muslim ( ` relig`=1 ) or christian ( ` relig`=2 ) religion , an indicator ( ` educ ` ) classifying women according to no ( ` educ`=0 ) , intermediate ( ` educ`=1 ) or high level ( ` educ`=2 ) of education and a grouping variable ( ` child ` ) for women having no ( ` child`=0 ) , one ( ` child`=1 ) or more than one child ( ` child`=2 ) , respectively .",
    "we additionally exploit the state of residence variable to define the hierarchy in our model via state - specific random intercepts .",
    "letting @xmath7 be the binary variable encoding contraceptive use for woman @xmath8 in state @xmath9 , we follow the classical generalized linear mixed model formulation in assuming @xmath10 independently for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 . recalling our aim ,",
    "the predictor is constructed as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15^t$ ] , @xmath16 is an indicator function taking value @xmath17 if @xmath18 , @xmath19 otherwise and @xmath20^t$ ] .",
    "such formulation consists of a state - specific intercept @xmath21 , an interaction between the group indicator ` child ` and the effect of ` age ` favoring a specific nonparametric functional relation among ` age ` and contraceptive use , for each level of variable ` child ` consistently with empirical evidences in figure [ predictor ] , and finally a set of dummy variables comprising the vector @xmath22 to learn if and how the different levels of the qualitative variables ` area ` , ` relig ` and ` educ ` have an effect on the probability of using a contraceptive .",
    "we drop one term for each set of dummy variables representing a qualitative variable , to avoid the dummy trap . as a result",
    "the @xmath23 coefficients will represent incremental effects with respect to the baseline .      taking a bayesian approach",
    "we specify prior distributions for the quantities @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath23 , with aims being to ( i ) provide a flexible bayesian formulation for adaptively modeling the determinants of contraceptive use , ( ii ) allow uncertainty in the distribution of the state - specific random intercepts , while avoiding over - shrinking and favoring clustering effects , ( iii ) develop an efficient algorithm for posterior computation .",
    "consistently with these aims we assume a multivariate normal prior distribution for the dummy coefficients by letting @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the prior mean vector and covariance matrix , respectively .",
    "to avoid overly - restrictive parametric functional assumptions , we employ a nonparametric approach by directly enforcing priors over the space of continuous smooth functions to model the relation between ` age ` and contraceptive use .",
    "specifically we let @xmath31 independently for @xmath27 , with @xmath32 a squared exponential correlation function @xmath33 , and @xmath34 a prior mean function which we assume constant zero ( i.e. @xmath35 ) .",
    "gaussian processes are widely used flexible stochastic processes in bayesian functional data analysis and nonparametric regression , see @xcite for a detailed overview . moreover , from a computational point of view , the gaussian process formulation has the property of inducing multivariate gaussian realizations for every finite subset of the domain of the function modeled .",

    "such result plays a key role in developing a gibbs sampler , without need of numerical approximations and metropolis - hastings steps . to conclude bayesian specification we characterize uncertainty in the distribution of the state - specific random intercepts by assuming @xmath42    the dirichlet process @xmath43 represents a fully flexible prior with support on the set of distributions on the real line , allowing @xmath44 to be unknown with @xmath45 indicating the best guess for such distribution and @xmath46 quantifying the confidence in such guess . in our application",
    "@xmath45 corresponds to the normal distribution @xmath47 with inverse gamma hyperprior for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 to favor learning of cluster effects in the data , where @xmath51 denotes the gamma distribution with shape @xmath52 and rate @xmath53 .",
    "there is a growing literature on dirichlet process theory and applications , see @xcite for a detailed overview ; in our model we exploit the stick - breaking representation of the dp prior , providing an helpful construction in terms of posterior computation and interpretation . specifically , following @xcite , the assumption @xmath54 is equivalent to @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a point mass at @xmath57 . a key result in such construction",
    "is that a realization of the dirichlet process is discrete in nature , favoring ties among state - specific random intercepts , with states in the same cluster having equal random intercept values . specifically denoting with @xmath58 the grouping variable",
    ", the stick - breaking representation favors clustering effects among states , providing @xmath59 , @xmath60 , with the number of clusters stochastically increasing in @xmath46 .",
    "this clustering property is particularly useful in our application , favoring states with common features such as geographic proximity , cultural acceptance , accessibility , women social condition or gender preferences , to share the same effect . beside these results , conditionally on the grouping indicator @xmath58 , the assumed gaussian base measure @xmath45 is conjugate , favoring the implementation of a gibbs sampler .",
    "posterior computation is performed by exploiting a recently proposed data - augmentation scheme based on a new class of plya - gamma distributions ; refer to @xcite for a detailed description and @xcite for recent results on uniform ergodicity of the resulting algorithm .",
    "the approach provides a strategy for fully bayesian inference exploiting the representation of the binomial likelihood parameterized by log - odds via mixture of gaussians with respect to plya - gamma distributions . specifically assuming a bayesian logistic regression setting where @xmath61)$ ] , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath23 having gaussian prior @xmath64 , the resulting gibbs sampler alternates between two full conditional conjugate steps @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; with @xmath68^t$ ] and @xmath69 .",

    "behavior with respect to sterilization substantially differs across the levels of variable ` child ` , while following different age patterns with respect to modern methods of contraception such as condom and oral pills . as expected modern contraceptive methods register a peak between 2030 years for women having no or one child and 2535 years for higher number of children while decreasing for later ages .",
    "sterilization is almost absent in women with no children while increasing its importance for higher levels of variable ` child ` , peaking approximately around 3545 years .",
    "when aggregating the different contraceptive behaviors , our model provides provably flexible estimates for the effect of variable age , according with findings in figure [ predictor ] . as expected the functional relation between age and contraceptive use in women with no children remains constant until 25 years when usage of modern methods peaks , and evolve around almost linear decreasing patterns for later ages .",
    "contraceptive use for women having more than one child recalls the parabolic age pattern of the most widely used sterilization method , with high and almost constant levels between 3040 years .",

    "the estimated interstate differences in our model substantially agree with aggregated descriptive statistics available from other national survey such as nfhs , and are related to marked interstate differences in accessibility , cultural acceptance and socio - economic status . to provide additional insights on such differences ,",
    "we compare the median of the posterior distribution for the random intercepts , with state - specific statistics available from the nfhs 2005 and @xcite .",
    "specifically we consider the percentage of sterilized women which represents the most widely used contraceptive method , while showing evident variations across states , and the percentage of working women which provides a possible proxy for women empowerment and status .",
    "maps in figure [ map ] show how lower values of state - specific random intercepts are reasonably associated to low percentage of sterilized and working women .",
    "these results further confirm the goodness of our model in flexibly accounting for interstate differences in contraceptive use .",
    "contraceptive use in india is a complex phenomenon and fully flexible approaches are required to properly account for marked cultural and socio - economic differences within the country .",
    "available statistical models prove to be overly - restrictive in assuming parametric relations between the probability to use contraceptives and covariates of interest , while typically failing in properly considering the hierarchical data structure or enforcing parametric distributions for the random effects . considering a gaussian process prior for the functional effect of variable age and using a dirichlet process prior with gaussian base measure for the state - specific random intercepts distribution we maintain simple computation , while allowing flexible bayesian modeling .",
    "we estimate reasonable effects for socio - economic indicators , showing how rural areas , muslim religion and low education are typically associated with lower contraceptive use .",
