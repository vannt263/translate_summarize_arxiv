    "deconfinement and chiral symmetry determine the properties of strongly interacting matter at high temperatures and densities to a large extent . while deconfinement is yet far from being understood , chiral symmetry restoration and the resulting effects can be shown to play the dominant role for the low energy sector of strong interactions and can be well studied within phenomenological models .",
    "however , most of these studies are restricted to the case of thermal equilibrium . since heavy ion experiments are non - equilibrium phenomena",
    ", there is a need for incorporating chiral symmetry breaking and restoration into a non - equilibrium theory .",
    "this is the purpose of this paper .    in order to develop a theoretical model for the evolution of heavy ion collisions including a dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry",
    ", one has to choose a model lagrangian for the underlying interaction .",
    "here we employ the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model in its two and three flavor versions @xcite .",
    "although nonconfining and nonrenormalizable , this model describes well the properties of light hadrons in the vacuum .",
    "recent lattice results indicate that also at high temperatures around the phase transition the temperature dependence of the condensate and of certain masses is correctly reproduced by the model @xcite .",
    "its relative simplicity is an additional good reason to start from this effective interaction .",
    "the njl lagrangian is used in the schwinger ",
    "keldysh formalism for non - equilibrium green functions and equations of motion for the particle densities are obtained . since",
    "their derivation is difficult , we give only a brief outline of this calculation and refer for more details about this subject to refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work we focus on the numerical solution of the transport equations . to this end",
    "we firstly investigate the mean field equations of motion , i.e. the vlasov equation , which describes the evolution of the density evolving in a mean field , and the gap equation , which describes the selfconsistent coupling of the mean field to the density .",
    "we show that particle number , energy and momentum are conserved .",
    "the latter two conservation laws rely on the existence of a potential energy , which we derive .",
    "the vlasov equation is a partial differential equation , which we numerically solve using a finite difference method . for simplicity ,",
    "we confine ourselves to spherically symmetric systems .",
    "the numerical solution of the vlasov equation is presented and the physical effects generated by the mean field are discussed .    in a second part , binary collisions are included into the equations of motion .",
    "since we also want to study the generation of of strange quarks via the processes @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we use the three flavor version of the njl model . after sketching the derivation of an equation of the boltzmann type including medium effects",
    ", we solve this equation using a relaxtion time approach .",
    "the relaxation times entering this ansatz are computed from cross sections , which depend on temperature and are given in ref .  @xcite . as for the vlasov equation ,",
    "a numerical solution of the boltzmann equation is given .",
    "we investigate the how the numerical results change when the medium effects are switched off in the relaxation times and in the mean field .",
    "we investigate also how a variation of the size of the initial system influences the final particle spectra and multiplicities .",
    "in particular , we study the chemical equilibration of strange quarks as the initial fireball grows larger .    to our knowledge",
    ", it is the first time that a kinetic equation for a strongly interacting system is solved where the input  mean fields and collision terms  are derived _ consistently _ from an underlying relativistic lagrangian and where all necessary medium effects are included . in particular the underlying symmetry  here chiral symmetry  is consistently preserved .",
    "also in the numerical solution we have chosen an unconventional way : solving a partial differential equation instead of the test particle method .",
    "of course , also a price has to be paid : the investigated system , a quark gas which , at the present stage , does not have the possibility of hadronization , is rather unrealistic and any comparison of our results with data from heavy ion collisions contains large uncertainties",
    ". therefore the results of the paper are important for further theoretical work .",
    "in this section , we give a brief derivation of the vlasov equation and a short introduction to the njl model in its two flavor version and discuss the conservation laws .",
    "then we outline the numerical methods used for solving the vlasov equation and present results for one initial condition .",

    "i.e. @xmath252 , gives a twice higher value for @xmath254 as compared to calculation ( a ) and ( c ) , i.e. @xmath220 , since more light quarks with high energy are available for the production of strange quarks .",

    ". there may be several reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "the first one is geometrical : equation  [ sresult ] contains a factor @xmath279 , which accounts for the smaller size of the strange system compared to the light quark system . estimating this factor to be @xmath280 from our numerical results , this suppresses the strangeness yield by a factor two .",
    "it is probable that this factor will appear with a different power for a cylindrically symmetric system .",
    "the second reason for our low strangeness yield is that strangeness production in the initial high energy nucleon ",
    "nucleon collisions . like @xmath281 , and strangeness production in the hadronic phase like @xmath282 are absent from our calculation .",
    "we have developed numerical methods for the solution of transport equations whose physics is derived from the two and three flavor njl lagrangian and have given explicit solutions for various initial conditions .",
    "a finite difference algorithm is used to solve the partial differential equation for a spherically symmetric system .",
    "the paper is divided in two parts : first , the analytical and numerical properties of the two flavor vlasov equation are given .",
    "then this equation is generalized to include strangeness and also a collision term is added , so one deals with a boltzmann type equation with selfconsistent medium dependent input .    the most serious limitation encountered is the nonrenomalizability of the njl model , which is treated by a cutoff of @xmath283  mev . for a thermal system with @xmath284",
    "mev about 60% of all particles have momenta @xmath285 and can not be properly accounted for .    for the vlasov equation the total energy includes a potential as well as a kinetic term .",
    "the potential contributes ca .",
    "5% to the total energy at @xmath99 . during the evolution",
    ", its contribution tends to zero as the mass evolves towards its vacuum value .",
    "the expansion dynamics in the vlasov equation is dominated by the increase of the constituent quark mass from @xmath228  mev at @xmath99 to @xmath286  mev at @xmath108 .",
    "correspondingly the quarks are slowed down during the expansion .",
    "for this reason the particle spectrum in momentum space changes during the expansion such that the low momentum region is enhanced and the high momentum region depleted .    simultaneously with the introduction of the collision term , the calculation is generalized to the three flavor model in order to study also the production of strange quarks .",
    "the collision term is implemented in a relaxation time approximation .",
    "in contrast to the vlasov equation , the boltzmann equation leads to an energy spectrum with an exponential shape at high energies .",
    "however , the mean field still manifests itself in an enhancement of the the low energy region of the spectra like for the vlasov equation .",
    "the shapes of the spectra do not change when the medium effects in the cross sections are switched off .    only for large systems chemical as well as thermal equilibration of strange quarks",
    "can be reached .",
    "the approach to chemical equilibrium as a function of the initial radius @xmath256 can be well approximated by a @xmath287 dependence .",
    "the absolute value of the strangeness yield found in our calculation is about a factor three smaller than observed in experiment @xcite .    what have we learned from this calculation ? admittedly , an expanding quark system is an artificial system , since it lacks confinement .",
    "yet it is a system in which the dynamics of a non - equilibrium system , which underlies chiral symmetry , can be studied .",
    "medium effects are taken care of in the mean field as well as in the collision term . in this respect",
    "the sophistication surpasses other calculations using more realistic interaction models . while we can not compare directly with experiment , yet",
    "at least three results may be of relevance : ( i ) the final spectra strongly depend on the mean field .",
    "for instance it is responsible for the enhancement at small energies .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the transition from a chirally symmetric to a chirally broken phase .",
    "( ii ) the calculated spectra are rather robust with respect to changes in the collision terms .",
    "whether one uses medium dependent cross sections or born cross sections makes little difference , provided one does not modify the masses and the mean field .",
    "( iii ) medium effects are small for the masses of the strange quarks .",
