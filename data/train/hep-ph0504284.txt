    "the existence of pentaquarks has been discussed for more than 30 years .",
    "light and heavy pentaquarks have alternatively been predicted and searched for .",
    "the new wave of interest in light pentaquarks was triggered by the prediction of a narrow width antidecuplet , made by diakonov , petrov and polyakov @xcite in the framework of the chiral soliton model , although predictions for the mass of @xmath0 have been around for nearly 20 years ( see e. g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the observation of the exotic pentaquarks @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 still remains controversial , the number of positive results being , in each case , about the same as that of null evidence .",
    "however new efforts are currently being made to confirm the previous positive results of leps and clas collaborations for @xmath0 , of na49 collaboration for @xmath1 and of h1 collaboration for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "theoretically there is a large variety of approaches to describe pentaquarks : skyrme and chiral soliton models , large @xmath3 studies , constituent quark models , qcd sum rules , lattice calculations , etc .",
    "( for recent reviews see for example @xcite ) .",
    "regarding the light antidecuplet the main issues are : the mass of @xmath0 , the spin and parity of the antidecuplet members , the splitting between isomultiplets , the influence of the representation mixing on the masses and on the strong decay widths , etc .    after discussing the light antidecuplet main issues ,",
    "the charmed antisextet is shortly reviewed in the context of an su(4 ) classification .",
    "constituent quark models describe a large variety of observables in baryon spectroscopy .",
    "it seems thus natural to inquire about their applicability to exotic hadrons .",
    "any constituent quark model hamiltonian has a spin - independent part ( free mass term + kinetic energy + confinement ) and a short - range hyperfine interaction .",
    "the most common constituent quark models used in pentaquark physics have either a color - spin ( cs ) or a flavor - spin ( fs ) interaction .",
    "there are also studies in the so - called hybrid models , which contain a superposition of cs and fs interactions @xcite .",
    "attempts to describe @xmath0 by using an instanton induced interaction have also been made @xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall present results in the fs model and compare them with corresponding results from other models .",
    "in su(3)@xmath4 @xmath5 multiplets can be obtained from the direct product of four quarks and an antiquark irreducible representation as @xmath6 which shows that the antidecuplet @xmath7 is one of the possible multiplets .",
    "the su(3)@xmath4 breaking induces representation mixing .",
    "one expects an important mixing between octet members and antidecuplet members with the same quantum numbers .",
    "this will be discussed below .",
    "the parity and spin can be found by looking first at a @xmath8 subsystem to which an antiquark is subsequently coupled .    in the fs model the lowest negative parity state of a @xmath5 system with total spin @xmath9 results from a @xmath8 subsystem which has the structure @xmath10_o [ 211]_c [",
    "211]_{oc};[211]_f [ 22]_s [ 31]_{fs } \\rangle$ ] , where o , c , f and s stand for orbital , color , flavor and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the symmetry @xmath11_o$ ] implies that there is no orbital excitation and the parity of the pentaquark is negative , i. e. the same as the intrinsic parity of the antiquark .",
    "but if one quark is excited to the p - shell the parity becomes positive and the lowest symmetry allowed for the orbital part of the wave function is @xmath12_o$ ] .",
    "then the pauli principle requires the @xmath8 subsystem to have the structure @xmath13_o [ 211]_c [ 1111]_{oc};[22]_f [ 22]_s [ 4]_{fs } \\rangle$ ] in its lowest state , which has @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "although this state contains one unit of orbital excitation the attraction brought by the fs interaction is so strong that it overcomes the excess of kinetic energy and generates a positive parity state below the negative parity one @xcite .",
    "after coupling @xmath8 to @xmath16 the total angular momentum is 1/2 or 3/2 .",
    "calculations based on the realistic fs hamiltonian of ref.@xcite , have been performed for @xmath0 in ref .",
    "@xcite and for the whole antidecuplet in ref .",
    "similar variational calculations were made earlier for heavy pentaquarks .",
    "the positive parity pentaquarks turned out to be lighter by several hundreds mev @xcite than the negative parity ones with the same quark content @xcite .",
    "recently , more involved calculations for @xmath0 , performed in the framework of a semi - relativistic version of the fs model proved once more that in the fs model the lowest state has positive parity @xcite .    based on semi - schematic estimates , in ref . @xcite it was claimed that in the cs model the lowest state for @xmath0 has also positive parity .",
    "as above , this implies an excess of kinetic energy due to an extra unit of orbital angular momentum .",
    "then , according to the pauli principle , the lowest symmetry of the wave function in the relevant degrees of freedom is @xmath12_{cs}$ ] .",
    "this symmetry brings less attraction than @xmath11_{fs}$ ] in the fs model , which is insufficient to overcome the excess of kinetic energy . the realistic study of ref .",
    "@xcite proves that this is the case , so that in the cs model the lowest resonant state has @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 state is even lower , but in the continuum .",
    "the same study shows that the hybrid models favor negative parity , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are several reasons to study pentaquarks in the fs model .",
    "this model reproduces the correct sequence of positive and negative parity levels in the low - energy spectra of nonstrange and strange baryons .",
    "in addition it is supported by lattice calculations @xcite and the flavor - spin symmetry is consistent with the large @xmath3 limit of qcd @xcite .    the results for the mass spectrum of @xmath7 pentaquarks based on the graz parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in fig",
    ". 1a . here , as in any other model including the chiral soliton",
    ", one can not determine the absolute mass of @xmath0 .",
    "this mass has been fitted to the presently accepted experimental value of 1540 mev .",
    "reasons to accommodate such a value are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . the pure @xmath7 spectrum , fig .",
    "1a , can approximately be described by the linear mass formula @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hypercharge .",
    "the fs model result is quite close to the presently estimated level spacing in the chiral soliton model @xcite where the parameters were allowed to vary considerably for well justified reasons . in the cs model",
    "the level spacing is much smaller . to a good approximation one has @xmath21 @xcite , where @xmath22 can be fixed by the mass of @xmath0 .    to construct all the antidecuplet members the masses of the following systems",
    "have been calculated in the graz parametrization @xcite : @xmath23 = 1452 mev , @xmath24 = 1540 mev , @xmath25 = 1723 mev , @xmath26 = 1800 mev , @xmath27 = 1962 mev and @xmath28 = 2042 mev .",
    "the antidecuplet members with @xmath20 = 1 and @xmath20 = 0 were obtained according to their wave functions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) as @xmath29 the octet members with @xmath20 = 1 and @xmath20 = 0 were obtained in a similar way @xmath30      as a consequence of the su(3)@xmath4 breaking the representations @xmath7 and @xmath31 mix .",
    "the existing data require mixing .",
    "there are some phenomenological studies where , by fitting the mass and the width of known resonances , one can obtain the mixing angle between the antidecuplet and one ( or more ) octets .",
    "in such studies the number of quarks and antiquarks is arbitrary in every baryon .    in phenomenological models where one assumes mixing between states having @xmath32",
    ", it turns out that the selected masses require a large mixing angle @xcite and the widths a small mixing angle @xcite .",
    "a compromise was found when the antidecuplet and octet states which mix had @xmath17 , in which case a large mixing angle consistent with both masses and widths was obtained @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", the @xmath17 state is the lowest resonant @xmath0 state in the cs model @xcite .",
    "its negative parity corresponds to an @xmath33 relative partial wave which can produce a rather large centrifugal barrier , thus a small width .",
    "the mixing of the antidecuplet with three octets with @xmath32 has also recently been investigated phenomenologically in the chiral soliton model where it was assumed that the mixing is small @xcite .",
    "it was found that this can reduce the size of the widths of the antidecuplet members without much affecting the masses .",
    "however , another chiral soliton study @xcite , based on an  exact \" treatment ( not only the first order ) of su(3)@xmath4 breaking advocates large @xmath34 mixing from the mass analysis . thus the representation mixing seems to remain a controversial problem in the chiral soliton model .",
    "the mixing takes place between octet and antidecuplet members with the same quantum numbers , i.e. for @xmath35 and @xmath36 states . here",
    "we suppose that there is mixing with the lowest pentaquark octet only .",
    "then there is only one mixing angle , introduced by the physical states , defined as @xmath37 for @xmath38 and similarly for @xmath39 .    in the fs model the mixing angles @xmath40 and @xmath41 were calculated dynamically in ref .",
    "the states which mix are all @xmath5 states , i. e. the number of quarks and antiquarks is fixed , contrary to the above phenomenological studies or to the spirit of the chiral soliton model .",
    "the mixing is determined by the the coupling matrix element v of @xmath7 and @xmath31 states .",
    "this has contributions from every part of the hamiltonian which breaks su(3)@xmath4 symmetry : the free mass term , the kinetic energy and the hyperfine interaction .",
    "it reads    @xmath42     = 166   ~\\mathrm{mev}~    & \\hspace{0.3 cm } \\mbox{for n } \\\\",
    "\\frac{2 \\sqrt{2}}{3 } ( m_s - m_u ) + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}~[s(uuss \\bar s ) - s(uuds \\bar d ) ]    = 155    ~\\mathrm{mev}~    & \\hspace{0.3 cm } \\mbox{for $ \\sigma$ }   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where the first term is the free mass term which alone generates an ideal mixing and s represents the combined contribution of the kinetic energy and hyperfine interaction @xmath43 the expressions ( [ coupling ] ) result from the wave functions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively and reflect their quark content .",
    "one can see that the numerical values of v are similar for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "[ figure1 ]     the mixing angle derived from the definitions ( [ physn ] ) is @xmath44 and similarly for @xmath39 .",
    "the resulting numerical values are @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "each value is very close to the ideal mixing angle @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "this implies that the  mainly antidecuplet \" state @xmath49 is 67 % antidecuplet and 33 % octet , which represents a large mixture .",
    "the content of the  mainly octet \" state @xmath50 is the other way round , i. e. 67 % octet and 33 % antidecuplet .",
    "then , for example , for positive charge pentaquarks with @xmath51 one has @xmath52",
    "i. e. the  mainly octet \" state has no strangeness and the `` mainly antidecuplet '' state contains the whole available amount of ( hidden ) strangeness .",
    "the physical masses , obtained from the diagonalization of a 2 @xmath53 2 matrix , are @xmath54    in the @xmath39 sector the situation is opposite .",
    "the mixing angle , @xmath46 ( @xmath55 ) minimizes the number of strange quarks ( antiquarks ) in @xmath56 and maximizes it in @xmath57 .",
    "this can be readily seen from the analogues of eqs .",
    "[ physn ] which give @xmath58 i. e. @xmath59 . as a consequence",
    ", the order of @xmath38 and @xmath39 is interchanged by the mixing , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the @xmath49 state is 70 mev higher than the option for a 1730 mev resonance in the new analysis of ref .",
    "the @xmath56 is about 30 mev far off the upper end of the experimental mass range 1630 - 1690 mev of the three star @xmath60 resonance and 10 mev below the lowest experimental edge of the one star @xmath61 resonance ( see the pdg @xcite full listings ) .",
    "the @xmath50 state is located in the roper resonance mass region 1430 - 1470 mev .",
    "however this is a @xmath62 state , i. e. different from the @xmath63 radially excited state obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite at 1493 mev .",
    "a mixing of the @xmath63 and the @xmath62 states could possibly be a better description of the reality .",
    "if the pentaquark @xmath0 exists , its width is expected to be small @xcite .",
    "the positive experiments have reported upper limits .",
    "in particular the leps collaboration at spring-8 , which reported the first observation of @xmath0 @xcite , gives @xmath64 25 mev .",
    "some recent analysis of the @xmath65 scattering gives an even smaller limit @xmath64 1 mev @xcite .",
    "in quark models an option to reduce the width is to introduce rearrangements , as for example , diquark correlations in the orbital and/or color - flavor - spin spaces .    in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath0 was described as a bound state @xmath32 of two extended @xmath66 diquarks and an antiquark @xmath67 .",
    "the size parameters of the wave function were varied and a decay width of about 1 mev was obtained for an asymmetric  peanut \" structure with @xmath67 in the center and the diquarks rotating around it .",
    "however , there is no dynamics justifying the range of values of the size parameters .    in ref .",
    "@xcite both parities were considered . but",
    "the width of the lowest positive parity state was expected to be smaller than that of the lowest negative parity state by a factor of 50 due to the centrifugal barrier .",
    "it was also suggested that the width can be lowered down by adequately reducing the coupling constant @xmath68 as compared to @xmath69 , due to large @xmath3 arguments .",
    "however the estimates of the widths have been made in a limit where the emitted meson is a point - like particle , like for ordinary baryon decay .",
    "it is hoped that more dynamical studies will better settle the width issue in the future .",
    "in most models which accommodate @xmath0 and its antidecuplet partners , heavy pentaquarks @xmath70 ( @xmath71 or @xmath72 ) can be accommodated as well . from general arguments",
    "they are expected to be more stable against strong decays than the light pentaquarks @xcite . in an su(4 )",
    "classification , including the charm @xmath73 , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that @xmath74 discussed above and having @xmath73 = 0 and a charm antisextet @xmath75 with @xmath73 = - 1 , belong to the same su(4 ) irreducible representation of dimension * 60*. this implies that @xmath76 , the @xmath14 member of this antisextet , is obtained from @xmath0 by replacing @xmath77 by @xmath78 .",
    "the other su(3 ) representations belonging to @xmath79 of su(4 ) are @xmath80 with @xmath73 = 1 and @xmath81 with @xmath73 = 2 .",
