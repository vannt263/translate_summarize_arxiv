    "as the interface growth is ubiquitous in nature , it have constituted an important subject of research in the past decades  @xcite . in general , the thickness of these interfaces , also named roughness @xmath6 , is a signature of the nonequilibrium growth conditions under which the interface has formed and their evolution can be characterized by the family - vicsek scaling relation @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the linear size of the system and @xmath9 is the evolution time .",
    "the scaling function @xmath10 behaves as @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "then , the roughness @xmath6 grows with @xmath13 until saturates in a value @xmath14 denominated saturation roughness , which behaves with the system size @xmath8 as a power law according as @xmath15 .",
    "the saturation times @xmath16 also grows with the system size as @xmath17 .",
    "the exponents @xmath18 and @xmath19 are known as roughness , growth and dynamic exponents , respectively .",
    "this scaling analysis lead to a considerable advance in the understanding of the roughening of interface growth and allow to define some universality classes which are related to a stochastic differential equation for the height @xmath20 of the system at position @xmath21 and time @xmath9 .",
    "lai and das sarma @xcite propose a general form for these equations @xmath22 where the parameters @xmath23 are related to the linear terms , @xmath24 to the nonlinear ones and @xmath25 is a white noise .    in the hydrodynamic limit ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , the @xmath28 term dominates and the asymptotic behavior is governed by the kpz universality class @xcite .",
    "this equation is the simplest nonlinear differential equation to describe a kinetic growth process and it has exact solution only in @xmath3-dimensions where the scaling exponents are @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    for models where the up - down symmetry is present , @xmath31 @xcite and the @xmath32 term of equation ( [ eq_gen ] ) dominates . in the asymptotic limit , we recuperate the linear equation proposed by edwards and wilkinson @xcite to studied a sedimentation process .",
    "this equation has an exact solution and the scaling exponents are given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the dimension of the substrate , and @xmath35 .",
    "however , for short and intermediate times , the process can present a behavior which is a portrait of the dominant term before of the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "an example is the linear equation proposed by wolf and villain @xcite and by das sarma and tamborenea @xcite to introduce surface diffusion where the term @xmath36 dominates for short times .",
    "equation ( [ eq_gen ] ) just with these term is linear and the exact solution gives @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in table 1",
    "we show the growth and the roughness exponents associated to the main terms of equation ( [ eq_gen ] ) , in @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the determination of the asymptotic universality class of a growth model may be a difficult task due to the extremely long time of the initial behavior that can mask the crossover to another one @xcite . to investigate this problem various techniques have been developed , as examples we can cite the investigation of the universality class using the surface diffusion currents @xcite , the application of the noise reduction technique to models with limited mobility @xcite , the investigation of finite size effects in the dt and wv models @xcite , the application of the scaling transformation to the stochastic equation of the wv model @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we propose a probabilistic interface growth model that is a generalization of the wv model where an adatom diffuses to maximize its coordination number . in our model , the incoming particle search for a site where the number of bonds is higher and it has a probability to be incorporate in this site .",
    "the probability depends of the number of bonds that the particle will have and it has a parameter @xmath4 so that , for @xmath43 , the wv model is recuperated . for low values of @xmath4 , the crossover to the asymptotic universality class occurs early and , for high values , the non - linear kpz universality class appears .",
    "a similar strategy was usaed in the investigation of the on - lattice eden model @xcite , where the authors show that the introduction of such probability growth leads to the growth of on - lattice eden clusters whithout the undesirable anisotropy effects .",
    "this strategy was initially proposed to generate an isotropic cluster of the on - lattice diffusion limited aggregation model @xcite . however",
    ", a later work @xcite shows that in the noiseless limit , instead of isotropic patterns , a @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) rotation in the anisotropy directions of the clusters grown on squre ( triangular ) lattices was observed .",
    "the model that we study is presented in the next section and the results in section 3 .",
    "the last section shows some conclusions .",
    "we study a model where the particles are randomly deposited on a @xmath34-dimensional lattice of linear size @xmath8 .",
    "the height of the interface at time @xmath9 is represented by @xmath46 and the number of bonds of each site by @xmath47 , with @xmath48 .",
    "the initial condition is given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the beginning of the simulation the interface is flat and a particle deposited into the site @xmath1 will have @xmath52 bonds , @xmath51 .",
    "a particle is deposited at random and search in its neighborhood for the site with the largest number of bonds and this site is chosen as the growing site . if the number of bonds of the particle can not be increased in the neighborhood , the particle will choose the deposition site as the growing site and , if it has more than one site with the same number of bonds , one of them is chosen at random .",
    "one particle is incorporated to the growing site with a probability given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the maximum number of bonds of one site , that is the case of a particle deposited in a site with its neighborhood fully occupied in a @xmath34-dimensional lattice .",
    "the variable @xmath4 is the parameter of the model that control the growth probability of a given site and , for @xmath55 , the wv original growth model is recovered .",
    "note that the rate growth of the sites with smaller neighbors number are decreased while the growth rate of sites with @xmath56 is always equal to @xmath57 and an increase in the control parameter @xmath4 emphasize the difference of these probabilities .",
    "after the deposition of a particle , the neighbors number of the growth site and of its neighbors must be updated . as usual @xcite , we define one time unit as the tentative of deposition of @xmath8 particles .",
    "as mentioned previously , if @xmath43 , the wv model is recovered as we can see in figures  [ wv_perfis](a ) , for @xmath39 , and [ p2d_nus](a ) , for @xmath40 .",
    "the interface obtained using this value exhibits a landscape governed by large plateaus separated by deep valleys that is the signature of models that incorporate diffusion  @xcite . for small values of @xmath4 , for example @xmath58 as shown in figure  [ wv_perfis](b ) , the interface resembles to that of  [ wv_perfis](a ) , however an attenuation of the largest steps are observed . moreover , as can be seen from figure  [ wv_perfis](c ) and ( d ) and in figure  [ p2d_nus](b ) and ( c ) , an additional increase in the @xmath4 value leads to an increase on this attenuation until the ridgeline landscape disappear completely , even for larger systems sizes and times asymptotically large .",
    "therefore , in both @xmath3 and @xmath5-dimensions , the effect of the @xmath4 parameter is to smooth the interface and this effect can be easily understood through an analyze of the growth probability .",
    "as observed previously , when we increase the @xmath4 parameter , the rate growth of sites with @xmath59 decreases , hence the appearing of peaks are reduced .    in order to characterize quantitatively the dependency of the roughening process by the parameter @xmath4",
    ", we consider the roughness of the interface that consist in the determination of the root mean square fluctuation in its height , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of sites in the substrate , @xmath46 is the height of the site @xmath1 at time @xmath9 and @xmath62 is the mean height of the interface  @xcite .",
    "we carried out simulations in systems of size ranging from @xmath63 up to @xmath64 for @xmath39 while , for @xmath40 , we used systems from @xmath63 up to @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath4 parameter was varied from @xmath66 to @xmath67 and from @xmath66 to @xmath68 , for @xmath3 and @xmath5-dimensions , respectively .",
    "as we can observe in figure  [ ws ] , for system in @xmath3-dimensions , an important consequence of the introduction of the growth probability is the arising of different behaviors . if the @xmath4 value is set to zero ( upper curve in figure  [ rugo_l1e5a ] ) , we find @xmath69 throughout all simulation , which means that the @xmath70 term of equation ( [ eq_gen ] ) dominates . however , for sufficiently small @xmath4 values ( @xmath58 ) , we observe a crossover in the @xmath41 exponent from a value @xmath71 to a value @xmath72 , very close to @xmath73 which means that the @xmath74 term of equation ( [ eq_gen ] ) begins to prevail .",
    "this crossover is previously observed for the wv original model @xcite . for a small increase in the @xmath4 parameter , e.g. for @xmath75 in figure  [ rugo_l1e5a ] ,",
    "the growth exponent is @xmath72 at all simulation .",
    "however , for an further increase in the @xmath4 parameter ( @xmath76 ) , we observe the exponent @xmath77 after a crossover time .    finally ,",
    "for largest @xmath4 values ( three bottom curve in figure  [ rugo_l1e5b ] ) , we can observe @xmath77 at all simulation .",
    "this new asymptotic growth exponent close to @xmath78 is directly related to the rejection of that particle which choose a site with a very low growth probability .",
    "therefore , this asymptotic value can be associated to the kpz universality class , similar to the restricted solid - on - solid model proposed by kim and kosterlitz @xcite .    corroborating the scaling of the roughness evolution",
    ", the saturation roughness also exhibits a crossover between different roughness exponents , as we can see in figure  [ wsat_nus ] . when low values of the @xmath4 parameter are used , for small values of @xmath8 , the roughness exponent exhibits a value close to @xmath79 , as observed for the @xmath70 term , and a value close to @xmath80 for largest values of the system size @xmath8 .",
    "however , when large @xmath4 values are used , this crossover disappear and the observed roughness exponent is always close to @xmath80 , a value obtained for both the ew ( @xmath81 term ) and kpz ( @xmath82 term ) universality classes .",
    "= 6.25 cm    in @xmath5-dimensions we obtained a similar scene as that observed in @xmath3-dimensions .",
    "the figures  [ rugo2d ] and [ wsat2d ] show the log - log and the semi log plots for the time evolution of the roughness and the system size dependency of the saturation roughness , respectively . as can be seen in these figures , for values of @xmath83 a crossover from a power law to a logarithm growth",
    "was observed for both , the roughness and the saturation roughness scaling . the initial value obtained to the growth ( @xmath84 ) and roughness ( @xmath85 )",
    "exponents are very close to those found to the universality class of the @xmath70 term , for wich @xmath86 and @xmath87 and the asymptotic behavior is logarithmic ( the growth and roughness exponent in the ew universality class are null that indicates a logarithmic behavior ) . for larger values of @xmath4 ,",
    "the scaling is always logarithmic .",
    "the results observed using intermediate @xmath4 values for both , @xmath88 and @xmath89 dimensions , indicating the ew asymptotic universality class are in good agreement with results found on literature  @xcite . besides",
    ", the time to the asymptotic behavior appear decreases as @xmath4 is increased , so intermediate values of @xmath4 can be used to anticipate the asymptotic universality class of the wv model .",
    "in this work we studied a modified wolf - villain growth model with a probabilistic growth rule proportional to the power of the coordination number of a growing site , _ i.e. _ , @xmath90 .",
    "simulations in @xmath3-dimensions indicate that , for low @xmath4 values , the model presents a crossover from the @xmath70 to the @xmath81 behavior , in agreement with the original model .",
    "we observe that the crossover time separating these two behavior decreases as @xmath4 increases .",
    "this fact indicates that intermediary values of @xmath4 can be used to anticipate the asymptotic universality class of the wv model .",
    "however , for intermediate @xmath4 values , the model presents a crossover from the linear @xmath81 to the @xmath82 nonlinear behavior and , for larger @xmath4 values , the model falls into the kpz universality class .",
    "the presence of the kpz asymptotic universality class in this modified version can be easily explained .",
    "the growth probability in this version introduce a refusal of particle .",
    "as know in the literature @xcite , the refusal of particle is one of the basic condition to the appearance of the kpz universality class . in @xmath5-dimensions , the model presents the same type of crossover and , as in the @xmath3-dimensional case , the crossover time is dependent of the @xmath4 value . for larger value",
    ", we found that the model belongs to the ew universality class .",
    "in further work , we intend to apply the probabilistic rule to models , e.g. the dt model , that take into account the relaxation to the neighbor considering its coordination number ."
