    "the inflationary paradigm ( see the review in linde 1990 ; kolb & turner 1990 ) offers an elegant solution to some of the outstanding problems of standard big bang cosmology . in these models , primordial quantum fluctuations ( hawking 1982 , starobinsky 1982 , guth & pi 1982 ) of some scalar field(s ) ( inflaton(s ) ) are produced , which eventually form galaxies , clusters of galaxies and the large - scale structure of the universe through gravitational instability .",
    "though there is a variety of possible models , parametrized by a few number of constants , the increasing amount of data , for example from redshift surveys and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies measurements , severely constrain the proposed models .",
    "hence some of them can be definitely excluded at this stage while the remaining ones are found to be viable only in some well defined region of their free parameter(s ) space .",
    "additional sharp constraints are expected from the planned satellite missions map and planck surveyor for the measurement of the cmb anisotropies up to small angular scales .    since it is known that the simplest cdm model with a flat ( n=1 ) initial spectrum of adiabatic perturbations does not agree with observational data ( if normalized to the cobe data at large scales , it has too much power at small scales ) , a number of approaches to increase the ratio of large to small scale power were proposed .",
    "one possibility is to change the initial spectrum of perturbations .",
    "since tilted scale - free spectra ( @xmath6 ) did not appear successful , the next step was to consider broken - scale - invariant ( bsi ) spectra arising in inflationary models with two effective scalar fields ( kofman , linde & starobinsky 1985 ; kofman & linde 1987 ; silk & turner 1987 ; kofman & pogosyan 1988 ; gottlber , mller & starobinsky 1991 ; polarski & starobinsky 1992 ) .",
    "recently , the cmb anisotropies for a model of double inflation ( lesgourgues & polarski 1997 ) was investigated and it was found that for values of the parameters which yield a power spectrum @xmath7 in fair agreement with observations , the doppler peak turns out to be low .",
    "this is related to the effective tilt of the spectrum on very large scales .",
    "another possibility is to add a positive cosmological constant leaving the initial @xmath8  spectrum unchanged .",
    "it was long known that the cosmological constant is viable only if it is accompanied by cold dark matter and , vice versa , its inclusion improves the cdm model a great deal ( as emphasized e.g. in kofman & starobinsky ( 1985)).this model remains viable after the detection of the cmb anisotropies on large angular scales by cobe ( kofman , gnedin & bahcall 1993 ) , and it is now perhaps the most promising cdm variant ( bagla , padmanabhan & narlikar 1995 ; ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) .",
    "as well known , one important motivation for a positive cosmological constant @xmath9 is that it provides the possibility to accomodate both a high hubble `` constant '' , @xmath10 , and a sufficiently old universe , @xmath11 gyrs .",
    "also , the baryon fraction in clusters seems to imply @xmath12   ( @xmath2  stands for the total matter density including cdm and baryons ) .",
    "the most recent strong argument in favour of @xmath13   ( and @xmath14  follows from the evolution of rich galaxy clusters ( bahcall , fan & cen 1997 , see also fan , bahcall & cen 1997 ) .    up to now",
    ", these two possibilities were considered as mutually exclusive .",
    "now we want to unite them and compare the bsi cdm model including a cosmological constant with the observational data .",
    "the reasons for this are the following .",
    "first , it can enlarge the allowed cosmological parameters window .",
    "second , the possibility exists that the initial power spectrum of scalar ( density ) perturbations in the universe is not scale free but has instead some non - trivial structure near @xmath15 .",
    "in fact observations may point to such a feature : the analysis of the three - dimensional distribution of rich abell galaxy clusters located in superclusters , performed in einasto _",
    "( 1997a ) , pleads for an unexpected spatial quasi - periodicity of the data ( see also einasto _ et al .",
    "_ 1997b , 1997c ) . also , the spatial distribution of all abell clusters of galaxies has a well - marked peak in the power spectrum at @xmath16 ( einasto _ et al . _",
    "the fourier power spectrum of the spatial distribution of apm galaxies also has a feature on the same scale , though of a slightly different form ( caztanaga & baugh , 1997 ) .",
    "note that the natural attempt to explain this feature by sakharov oscillations produced by the baryon admixture to cdm does not work ( atrio - barandela _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 , eisenstein _ et al .",
    ". so this feature , if confirmed by future improved large scale structure observations , should be ascribed to the initial perturbation spectrum itself .",
    "therefore , we need an initial spectrum which has a non - trivial structure around some scale ( preferably , with a bump ) and has essentially no tilt at larger and smaller scales . the latter condition is necessary in order to have sufficiently early galaxy and quasar formation . on the other hand",
    ", this spectrum should be derivable from some first principles ( e.g. , it could be generated in a concrete inflationary model ) .",
    "such a spectrum naturally arises in a well - defined and rather generic ( though idealized , of course ) inflationary model where the inflaton potential @xmath17  has a local steplike feature in the first derivative .",
    "an exact analytical expression for the scalar ( density ) perturbations generated in this model was found in starobinsky ( 1992 ) .",
    "it has a universal shape depending on only one parameter @xmath1 .",
    "actually , it seems to be the only example of a perturbation spectrum with the desired properties , for which a closed analytical form exists .",
    "thus , we suppose that the inflaton potential @xmath17  has a rapid change of slope in a neighborhood @xmath18  of @xmath19 : @xmath20 the resulting adiabatic perturbation spectrum is non - flat around the point @xmath21 , @xmath22  being the time at which @xmath23 while @xmath24 is the hubble parameter",
    ". one can show ( starobinsky 1992 ) that if the width @xmath18  of the singularity is small enough , namely , @xmath25 , then the adiabatic perturbation spectrum has maximal deviation from flatness , and acquires a universal form that can be derived analytically : @xmath26 where @xmath27  is the ( peculiar ) gravitational potential .",
    "this expression , plotted in fig .",
    "[ figphi ] , depends ( besides the overall normalization ) on two parameters @xmath1  and @xmath28 .",
    "the shape of the spectrum does not depend on @xmath28 , @xmath28  only determines the location of the step . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the spectrum has a flat upper plateau on larger scales , even with a small bump , and a sharp decrease on smaller scales , with large oscillations though .",
    "for @xmath4 this picture is inverted .",
    "the ratio of power between the plateaux equals @xmath30 , and for @xmath31 we just recover the ( flat ) scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich spectrum . note that this spectrum can not be obtained in the slow - roll approximation ( even with any finite number of adiabatic corrections to it ) . in this model",
    "it is still possible to fix freely the amount of primordial gravitational waves ( gw s ) for given @xmath1 and normalization and we consider here the model with no gw s at all . without the inclusion of a cosmological constant , we would be forced to consider the case @xmath29  only , in order to increase power on large scales . since @xmath32  already produces a desired excess of large - scale power , we are now free to consider both cases @xmath29  and @xmath4 .",
    "we use for this study observational constraints both on the matter power spectrum @xmath7 on one hand , and on the cmb anisoptropies on large , intermediate and small angular scales on the other hand , as done in lesgourgues & polarski ( 1997 ) , and we refer the interested reader to this article for more details .",
    "in this work we restrict ourselves to the case of a spatially flat universe , containing cold dark matter , baryonic matter with @xmath33 , and a cosmological constant @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the two cosmological parameters @xmath34  and @xmath35 are free .",
    "the present power spectrum @xmath7  reads : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , is the gravitational potential at the matter dominated stage for large redshifts @xmath38  when @xmath39 , and we put the light velocity @xmath40 .",
    "the scale factor @xmath41  is given by the expression @xmath42  where @xmath43 , @xmath44const .",
    "the transfer function @xmath45  is computed with the fast boltzmann code cmbfast by seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) , for each value of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the power spectrum is normalized to the four years cobe dmr data ( bennett _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , using @xmath46(in the relevant cases , cobe scales will always correspond to the small-@xmath47 flat plateau of the initial spectrum ) . afterwards , we use the following tests to discriminate between each set of values of the cosmological , resp .",

    "the `` optical '' @xmath49 .",
    "white , efstathiou and frenk ( 1993 ) give @xmath50 , with conservative errorbars .",
    "this is a sharp constrain at wavenumbers @xmath51 .",
    "more recent determinations of this quantity have a tendency to decrease it to @xmath52 , and even a bit lower ( ebe , cole & frenk 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; ying , mo & brner 1997 ) .",
    "still , we shall use the former value ( the exponent of @xmath53 corresponds to the case of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker model with a @xmath54term , see below ) .",
    "peculiar velocities , deduced from the mark iii catalog , and potent reconstruction of the density field . in our case , the power spectrum has got strong oscillations , so we can not simply use direct estimates of @xmath7  at given wavenumbers ( kolatt & dekel 1997 ) , which would give precise constraints in the case of a smooth spectrum .",
    "we will rather use the rms bulk velocity in a sphere of radius @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57  is the fourier transform of the top - hat window function of radius @xmath55 , and @xmath58(@xmath59  is the linear growth factor for inhomogeneities ) . expressing @xmath60  as a power law , @xmath61",
    ", one can easily compute the index for a given @xmath53  and @xmath35 . in the interesting range @xmath62 , @xmath63  for an open universe with @xmath64 , but @xmath65  for a flat universe with @xmath66 . in the following",
    "we will take @xmath67 .",
    "the mark iii potent result at @xmath68  ( with a gaussian smoothing at @xmath69 ) is @xmath70 ( kolatt & dekel 1997 ) .",
    "the cosmic variance ( the possible dissimilarity between the rms value of @xmath71 and the particular realization in our local neighborhood ) is quite large for this quantity ( @xmath72 ) , and can be added in quadrature with the previous errorbar , leading to a global uncertainty @xmath73 .",
    "this test is mainly sensitive to wavenumbers @xmath74 .",
    "3 .   redshift surveys .",
    "since they are strongly bias - dependent , redshift surveys give indications about the shape of @xmath7 . here again , due to the oscillations , instead of using some sets of estimates at given wavenumbers , one has to convolve the spectrum with the window functions of a given experiment and compare with the raw data .",
    "we use the count - in - cells analysis of large - scale clustering of the stromlo - apm redshift survey .",
    "taking other experiments into account would slightly improve the precision , but not change the results , since stromlo - apm is in very good agreement with other redshift surveys , as can be seen in peacock & dodds ( 1994 ) .",
    "after normalizing the spectrum to @xmath75 , we compute the variance @xmath76  in cells of size @xmath77 , and compare it with the data ( loveday _ et al . _ , 1992 ) , consisting of nine points ( assumed to be independent , with error bars treated as @xmath78 ones ) , through a @xmath79  analysis .",
    "since we can vary four parameters ( plus the overall normalisation , which is irrelevant for this test ) , @xmath80  is excellent , whereas @xmath81 is bad .",
    "cmb anisotropies .",
    "we compute the curves @xmath82 using cmbfast , and compare it with some preliminary measurements . at the moment , there are still many uncertainties , and we only have global indications on the @xmath83 s curve .",
    "as far as the first peak is concerned , a sixth order polynomial fit to the full available data set gives @xmath84^{1/2}=28\\times 10^{-6}~{\\rm with}~l=260 $ ] ( lineweaver & barbosa , 1997 ) , but it is very difficult to calculate an errorbar for this quantity in the general case .",
    "cat and ovro give an indication on the amount of power on small scales , but do not constraint the position and height of the secondary peaks .",
    "+ since the precision of these measurements is increasing very quickly , we do not intend in this work to perform a full @xmath79  analysis , using each result and the corresponding window function ( to find which parameters yield the best agreement ) .",
    "we prefer to calculate the @xmath83 s and comment our results in such way that in a few years one could easily update the analysis , restrict the allowed parameters window and eventually rule out the model .",
    "this is why we concentrate on the position and height of the peaks .",
    "we will use cmb data to eliminate parameters only if there is an obvious discrepancy between the predicted curve and the observations .",
    "starting with a flat spectrum , we explore the range @xmath85  and @xmath86 . for each value of @xmath48",
    ", there are some @xmath35 s in agreement with the @xmath49  constraint : ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) , ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) and ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) .",
    "these windows are inside the limits @xmath93  found in kofman , gnedin & bahcall ( 1993 ) , and are in good agreement with other tests : bulk velocity , with @xmath94 , and count - in - cells , with @xmath95 .",
    "there is no obvious contradiction with cmb measurements , and the first doppler peak is fairly high : @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary to depart from a flat spectrum in order to explain all observations ( apart , of course , from a possible spike in the spectrum at @xmath97 ) if @xmath48  and @xmath35  turn out to be close to these values .",
    "however , as we shall see , the steplike spectrum is compatible with a larger subset ( @xmath48 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "it also predicts some specific features in @xmath7  and @xmath83 curves that could easily be observed or ruled out by future experiments , so we are _ not _ just adding some extra degeneracy .",
    "more precisely , one can think of a spectrum with :    @xmath29 , in order to get less power on small scales in the primordial spectrum . to compensate the loss of power in @xmath7",
    ", we will allow smaller values of the cosmological constant .",
    "this will lower the cmb anisotropies .",
    "then , to avoid a problematic collapse of the first acoustic peak , like in double inflation ( lesgourgues & polarski , 1997 ) , @xmath28  must be chosen so that multipoles up to @xmath98  ( at least ) are given by the upper plateau of the primordial spectrum .",
    "this means that we can forget any @xmath99 . for @xmath100 , the first peak is even enhanced by a few percents by the global maximum of the primordial spectrum ( the `` bump '' at the extremity of the upper plateau ) .",
    "@xmath4 , in order to get more power on small scales in the primordial spectrum , and therefore allow some higher values of the cosmological constant which would be excluded by small scale constraints ( for instance , @xmath49 ) in case of a flat spectrum ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "since cmb peaks grow with @xmath101 , multipoles @xmath102  will be unusually large .",
    "a priori , in this case , the step is anywhere between the cobe and @xmath49  scales : @xmath103 .",
    "however , in this case the spectrum ( 3 ) has a well - pronounced sharp maximum at @xmath104  for the values @xmath105which are the most interesting ones as will be seen below ( for @xmath106 the maximum is located at @xmath107 ) .",
    "so , if we want to use this bump to explain the feature in the cluster spectrum at @xmath108 , @xmath28  should be taken @xmath109 .",
    "note that this possibility was not expected and discussed before .",
    "we consider first the case @xmath87 .",
    "assumption a turns out to be successfull with respect to the first three tests in many cases : for any @xmath110 , one can find a large allowed window in the @xmath111  plane .",
    "of course , a smaller @xmath101will lead to a higher range for @xmath1 . for instance , when @xmath112 , we find @xmath113  and @xmath114 .",
    "we must stress that satisfying the three tests is a success , since most other models satisfy two of them at most .",
    "for instance , if a tilted spectrum leads to a correct @xmath49and @xmath79 , the bulk velocity will be generally too low , unless a very large cosmic variance is invoked .",
    "double inflation will predict a higher @xmath115 , but still under the @xmath116  errorbar . in the present model",
    ", @xmath115  is much higher , in very good agreement with observations , as can be seen on table i ( second line ) for one example , because there is at least as much power on scales @xmath117   as for a scale invariant spectrum .",
    "including cmb anisotropies in the tests provides two independent constraints :    * on one hand , the position and height of the first peak are essentially related to cosmological parameters , not inflationary parameters .",
    "indeed , as we said previoulsly , in the relevant cases ( @xmath118 ) , the first peak is deduced from an essentially scale invariant spectrum ( with only a little enhancement proportional to @xmath1 , but @xmath119 , on @xmath120  in viable cases ) , and depends only on @xmath48  and @xmath101 .",
    "+ the position and height of the first peak are not precisely constrained by observations at the moment , neither by saskatoon ( whose calibration is under progress : leicht , in preparation ) , nor by msam . inside the allowed @xmath111  window found previously , we find @xmath121 , in good agreement with current limits , so we can not exclude any set of parameters .",
    "* on the other hand , experiments on the secondary peaks scales constrain @xmath1  and @xmath28 .",
    "the global height of the multipoles at @xmath122 depends on @xmath1 , whereas @xmath28  gives the detailed shape at these scales ( for instance , the ratio between the peaks ) , by shifting the maxima and minima of the primordial spectrum in @xmath123space .",
    "+ at the moment , observations do not indicate a detailed shape , but from cat and ovro we know that multipoles on such scales should range basically between @xmath124^{1/2}=10\\times 10^{-6}$ ]  and @xmath125 .",
    "since we are not dealing with the detailed window function of each measurement , we must be extremely conservative . using the second point of cat",
    ", one can state that a @xmath83 curve that would not reach @xmath126 ( the @xmath116  value ) in the range @xmath127(for which the window function is above half of its peak value ) can be confidently excluded .",
    "the reason for which we use this particular point is that the associated window function does not interfear with the first acoustic peak : it is probing power only on the scales of the secondary ones .",
    "this restriction provides , for each value of the cosmological constant , an upper limit on @xmath1 , and we find that for @xmath128 , all sets of parameters are ruled out .",
    "this is an indirect constraint on @xmath101 . for @xmath129",
    ", the previously found windows still hold .",
    "finally , for @xmath129 , all the constraints can be satisfied by some values of @xmath1  and @xmath28  in the ranges @xmath130   and @xmath131 . to illustrate this case ,",
    "we show in table i ( second line ) a particular example : @xmath132  ( @xmath101  is chosen to obtain the preferred value @xmath133 , and @xmath1  is as low as possible , in order to maximize small scales anisotropies ) .",
    "we also give an example of the case @xmath134 , @xmath135 , though it is excluded by cat .",
    "the corresponding power spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figpk ] , the cmb anisotropies in fig .",
    "[ figcmb ] .",
    "this type of model could be easily discriminated by the forthcoming improvements of redshift surveys and cmb observations .",
    "the former might state about the little well predicted in the @xmath7around @xmath136 .",
    "the latter will soon indicate :    * first , the position and amplitude of the first peak , i.e. , @xmath48  and @xmath35  ( in the framework of this model ) .",
    "* second , power on small scales , i.e. @xmath1 .",
    "* finally , the shape of secondary peaks , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "this model is very unlikely to be degenerate with some other one ( for instance , other cosmological parameters plus tilted spectrum ) from the point of view of cmb anisotropies , because it predicts a tremendously high ratio between multipoles at scales @xmath98  and @xmath137 ( recall that , in contrast with tilted , @xmath6 , or with double inflationary models , small scales are lowered however intermediate scales are preserved ) .    a similar analysis can be performed for higher @xmath48  values . since increasing @xmath48  lowers the cmb multipoles , @xmath1  is more restricted now by the constraints on small scales anisotropies . at @xmath48=0.6 , possible models have @xmath138 , @xmath139  and @xmath131 .",
    "the first peak reaches lower values as well : @xmath140 . when @xmath91 , we find @xmath141 and furthermore @xmath142 .",

    "for instance , when @xmath144 , the allowed region is @xmath145  and @xmath146 . in the last subsection , it was found that for @xmath29 , the most compelling constraint was on @xmath49 .",
    "now the three tests play an important part in the definition of the allowed region .",

    "when @xmath151 , the bulk velocity is sometimes too small due to this little depression . on the contrary , when @xmath152 , the maximum often generates excessive bulk velocities .",
    "as expected , the cmb anisotropies are amplified by both the comological constant and the primordial spectrum step .",
    "the basic picture is that the @xmath83 s are enhanced by a factor @xmath30  for @xmath153 .",

    "as in the previous subsection , we can use the last cat point to reduce the allowed window , confidently excluding any @xmath83 curve that would not pass @xmath155 ( the @xmath116  value ) in the range @xmath127 .",

    "that is why the cat cmb experiment appears the most restrictive for the model .",
    "so , the exact measurement of @xmath83  for @xmath183 , i.e. around the second acoustic ( doppler ) peak , will be the crucial test for this model .",
    "the forthcoming improvements of cmb anisotropies measurements , especially baloon and satellite experiments , should be able either to rule out this model or to detect its signature in the next ten years .",
    "on the other hand , the increase of the allowed region in the ( @xmath48 , @xmath35 ) plane and the allowed range for @xmath1  itself are not large .",
    "this shows the remarkable robustness of the cdm@xmath177  cosmological model with the simplest inflationary initial conditions ( @xmath184 ; @xmath8 ) .",
    "also , the fact that the allowed values of @xmath1  are close to unity indicates that the form of the inflaton potential @xmath17  is close to the case of a discontinuity in its second , not first derivative , which is more natural since , e.g. , it can occur as a result of an equilibrium second - order phase transition ( some kind of non - analytic behaviour of @xmath17  is required in any case to obtain significant deviations from the flat perturbation spectrum ) .",
    "consideration of the latter case is under progress .",
