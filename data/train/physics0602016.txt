    "the problem of controlling elementary chemical reactions , and especially the advances in the field of quantum informatics @xcite stimulate interest towards controlling quantum state of microscopic spin systems @xcite .",
    "spin correlated radical pairs are one of the most intriguing quantum objects .",
    "the quantum state of such a pair can be controlled by applying external magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "additional application of resonant microwave fields substantially widens the possibilities for manipulating the spins .        shows the scheme of transitions between spin states of a radical ion pair induced by hyperfine interaction with magnetic nuclei and resonant microwave field .",
    "usually the set of singlet state of the pair @xmath0 with zero total spin and three triplet states @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 with total spin 1 and its projection on the @xmath4 axis equal to @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , is taken is the basis . in strong applied magnetic field",
    "the degeneracy of the triplet states is lifted by zeeman interaction . in the absence of microwave field and relaxation",
    "the populations of @xmath1 and @xmath3 states , as well as the sum of the populations of @xmath2 and @xmath0 states remain constant . in the presence of hyperfine interaction",
    "the states @xmath2 and @xmath0 are not stationary , and their populations periodically change with time . this phenomenon is referred to as quantum beats and is observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "quantum beats can also be induced by differences in the @xmath8-values of the pair partners @xcite .",
    "a resonant microwave field induces transitions between the triplet states , which leads to changes in the population of singlet state of the pair and can be used to optically detect esr spectra of radical ions in liquids @xcite .",
    "if the rate of transitions between @xmath0 and @xmath2 states is higher than between the triplet states , periodic changes of the singlet state population with frequency proportional to amplitude of the microwave field are observed , which is referred to as quantum oscillations @xcite . in the opposite limiting case of strong microwave field , when the rate of transitions between the triplet states exceeds the rate of transitions between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , singlet - triplet transitions are slowed down , and the so - called spin locking is observed . as was demonstrated @xcite for pairs formed in singlet initial spin state",
    "a strong microwave field only slows down singlet - triplet transitions but does not completely block them , and the population of @xmath2 state always remains low .",
    "this was suggested as a possible route to control spin state of such a pair .",
    "if the microwave field is switched off at the moment when the population of the singlet state is minimal , most pairs will be trapped in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 states .",
    "the only way to get into the singlet state for them is spin - lattice relaxation .",
    "a similar idea was exploited to experimentally substantially prolong lifetime of the radical pair in photosynthetic reaction center @xcite by transferring it into its @xmath1 and @xmath3 states .",
    "another route to control spin state of the pair was found theoretically in the work @xcite .",
    "if a strong resonant microwave field is rapidly switched on at the moment when spin system is in its @xmath2 state , the pair is completely locked in triplet state and will never become singlet through dynamic transitions .",
    "a possibility of controlling spin state of the pair with very short pulses of very strong microwave field has also been treated theoretically @xcite .",
    "the theory shows that quantum beats in radical pair can be controlled with two ( for singlet - born pairs ) or just one ( for triplet - born pairs ) short microwave pulses .",
    "the already cited works @xcite treated spin dynamics of a radical pair in static magnetic and resonant microwave fields neglecting relaxation . a method for solving the problem of spin dynamics taking into account relaxation",
    "was developed in work @xcite , and approximate solutions in the two limiting cases of large and small splitting were obtained .",
    "a method for numerical solution of this problem taking into account relaxation and ion - molecular charge transfer reaction was developed in work @xcite . in the present contribution",
    "we provide a general analytical solution for the problem of spin evolution of a radical ion pair taking into account spin relaxation and use it to analyse the characteristic features of time evolution of the pair spin state in microwave field .",
    "let us consider what happens when a non - polar solution is irradiated by ionizing radiation .",
    "as an example we shall use liquid hydrocarbons ( rh ) , in which ionizing irradiation in the presence of electron ( a ) and hole acceptors ( d ) initiates the processes which in turn lead to formation of several types of singlet spin correlated pairs @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 and their subsequent recombination @xcite .",
    "singlet excited molecules ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) produced by recombination emit a quantum of light that is detected by experimental setup .",
    "the intensity of the detected luminescence is thus proportional to probability of forming singlet excited molecules upon recombination .",
    "the effects of magnetic fields on recombination luminescence have as their origin spin evolution in geminate pairs and dependence of the yield of luminescence on the multiplicity of excited molecule formed by recombination .",
    "an important advantage of non - polar solutions is that the initial inter - partner distance in the pairs after ionization ( normally @xmath15  nm ) is substantially lower than onsager radius ( @xmath1630  nm for alkanes at room temperature ) .",
    "the overwhelming majority of the pairs thus recombine as geminate pairs , i.e. , with their sibling counter ion . upon ionization of molecule the spin of the ejected electron does not change its state .",
    "since in the molecule the spins were paired , the initial spin state of the geminate pair is always singlet .",
    "charge transfer to acceptors and charge recombination also do not change spin states .",
    "this means that the multiplicity of the excited molecule formed by recombination is determined by the multiplicity of the recombining pair immediately before recombination .",
    "the multiplicity of the excited molecule is thus determined by spin evolution of the geminate radical ion pair between the moments of ionization and recombination .",
    "static or oscillating magnetic fields can substantially affect this evolution . and",
    "finally , as excited molecules normally emit light from their singlet excited state , any effect of magnetic fields on the spin state of the pair is directly reflected in the intensity of recombination luminescence .    in liquid non - polar solution",
    "the partners of the pair formed by irradiation spend almost the entire period of time from ionization and up to recombination at substantial distances from each other ( tens of nanometers ) , as their approach to distances about 12  nm leads to practically instant recombination .",
    "thus dipole - dipole and exchange interactions between the pair partners can be safely neglected .",
    "spin evolution of the pair in this case is driven by interaction of electron spin with spins of nuclei ( hyperfine interaction , hfi ) , with external magnetic fields , and by spin relaxation processes .",
    "spin hamiltonian for radical pair consisting of radicals @xmath17 and @xmath18 in high static magnetic field @xmath19 and microwave filed with magnetic component @xmath20 can be written as follows : @xmath21(\\hat{\\bm{s}}^a+\\hat{\\bm{s}}^d)+ \\hat{{s}}_{z}^a\\sum_{i}a^a_i\\hat{{i}}_{zi}^a + \\hat{{s}}_z^d\\sum_{j } a^d_j\\hat{{i}}_{zj}^d,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are spin operators for electrons , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are spin operators for magnetic nuclei in radicals @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",

    "we assume that the partners of the pair have identical g - values ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "as was shown in work @xcite in the presence of spin relaxation time evolution of the spin operators for the partners of the radical pair @xmath27 and @xmath28 is describe with a system of equations in the frame rotating at the frequency of the applied microwave field that are similar to bloch equations @xcite . for operator @xmath27",
    "the system is written as : [ bl_all ] @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the times of spin - lattice and spin - spin relaxation .",

    "as shows , time profile of the populations of different states are qualitatively different upon application of weak and strong microwave fields . in a weak field @xmath111 and @xmath112 oscillate in antiphase with frequency close to @xmath166 .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations drops because of phase relaxation , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 asymptotically approach each other .",
    "the sum of populations @xmath169 in this case is a more smooth curve , which is periodically modulated with frequency close to @xmath153 .    in a strong microwave field",
    "we see the manifestations of spin locking .",
    "singlet state population",
    "@xmath111 oscillates at a frequency about @xmath61 similar to the weak field case , but the amplitude of these oscillations is rather small .",
    "oscillations of substantial amplitude occur at a frequency about @xmath154 .",
    "this is also the frequency , at which changes the sum of populations @xmath169 .",
    "the population of the triplet state @xmath91 increases with the time of phase relaxation @xmath63 .",
    "first of all we note that all these results were obtained in the case of fixed nuclear configurations in both partners of the pair . in the presence of the reaction of ion - molecular charge transfer",
    "this condition is no longer observed , but this apparently does not change the zero microwave field invariant ( [ zero_mw ] ) .",
    "the high microwave field invariant ( [ strong_mw ] ) will also remain valid if the condition @xmath170 is not violated in the course of the reaction .",
    "let us formulate the main rules for spin evolution of a radical pair that follow from the existence of invariants ( [ zero_mw ] ) and ( [ strong_mw ] ) .",
    "* in the absence of microwave pumping the sum of populations of the states @xmath0 and @xmath91 ( or @xmath0 and @xmath2 in different notation ) remains constant at times shorter than @xmath62 .",
    "the populations of these states oscillate at a frequency @xmath171 , where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are resonance frequencies for radicals @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "it also naturally follows that the sum of populations of the states @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( or @xmath1 and @xmath3 ) does not change as well .",
    "invariant ( [ zero_mw ] ) is destroyed by spin - lattice relaxation .",
    "even weak resonant microwave field also destroys invariant ( [ zero_mw ] ) .",
    "the sum of populations @xmath127 starts oscillating at a frequency close to @xmath153 ( quantum oscillations induced by microwave field ) . * in a strong resonant microwave field remain constant the sum of populations of the states @xmath0 and @xmath89 , as well as @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the consequence of this is the effect of spin locking .",
    "the high field invariant ( [ strong_mw ] ) is rather accurately conserved already for not very large magnitudes of @xmath34 quite accessible in experiment . the magnitude of @xmath34 required to maintain the invariant ( [ strong_mw ] ) increases with detuning from resonance .",
    "the high field invariant ( [ strong_mw ] ) is destroyed by phase relaxation .",
    "the two invariants that we found suggest a way of controlling transitions between spin states of a radical pair . one possible variant of controlling quantum spin state would be a rapid switching of a strong microwave field on and off . in this case",
    "the pair will alternatively be in the conditions when one of the invariants is conserved .",
    "another possible control option may be a rapid change in the phase of the microwave field by @xmath172 . in this case the axes @xmath33 and @xmath92 are exchanged , which correspondingly changes the populations of the @xmath89 and @xmath90 states .",
