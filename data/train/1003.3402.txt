    "the inspiral and coalescence of binary black holes or neutron stars appears to be the most promising source for the detectors of gravitational waves , so that there has been much effort going into the development of numerical codes and analytic approximation methods to find the corresponding solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "one of the recent approaches assumes the existence of a helical killing vector @xmath0 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the field is assumed stationary in a rotating frame where @xmath0 generates time translations but @xmath0 becomes null at the light cylinder and is spacelike outside .",
    "@xmath0 has the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is timelike and @xmath3 is spacelike with circular orbits with parameter length @xmath4 ( except where @xmath5 ) ; @xmath6constant .",
    "the space - time is not stationary but it is still periodic where @xmath0 is spacelike . requiring the helical symmetry for a binary system implies equal amounts of outgoing and incoming radiation so that the space - time , containing energy radiated all times is not expected to be asymptotically flat .",
    "a corresponding solution in maxwell s theory for two opposite point charges moving on circular orbits was considered a long time ago by schild @xcite .",
    "the properties of the field were analyzed recently in the newman - penrose formalism in @xcite .",
    "the rather complicated periodicity properties of the solution became apparent as well as its asymptotic behaviour : at @xmath7 the advanced fields exhibit the standard bondi - type expansion and peeling , whereas the retarded fields do decay with @xmath8 but in an oscillatory manner like @xmath9 .",
    "hence for the retarded plus advanced solution no radiation field is asymptotically defined .",
    "naturally , one would like to go beyond the linearized theory .",
    "there are special exact , time - dependent , solutions known , for example , szekeres s dust solution , which has in general no killing vector , which can be matched to an exterior schwarzschild metric @xcite .",
    "one can construct oscillating spherical shells of dust particles moving with the same angular momentum , but in every tangential direction , or oscillating einstein clusters which are matched to the schwarzschild space - time outside @xcite .",
    "can there be periodic solutions representing  bound states \" of gravitational or electromagnetic waves so that the radiation field at infinity vanishes and the bondi mass remains constant ?",
    "there have been various attempts to prove that , while solutions of the vacuum einstein equations can be genuinely periodic in a suitable time - coordinate ( so _ not _ time - independent ) , these solutions can not be asymptotically flat .",
    "these started with @xcite and @xcite , with a summary in english in @xcite , and @xcite and more recently was considered in @xcite .",
    "the method in @xcite considers vacuum metrics which are everywhere nonsingular , weak and asymptotically - flat and which can be expanded in a series in some parameter , with the flat metric as the first term in the series .",
    "each term in the series is assumed to be periodic in a fixed minkowski time - coordinate and to satisfy the de donder gauge condition .",
    "the second and third terms , call them @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , are expanded as fourier series in the background time - coordinate and the einstein equations then imply that @xmath10 satisfies the source - free wave equation , and @xmath11 satisfies a wave equation whose source is a quadratic expression in @xmath10 . assuming that the solution for @xmath10 is everywhere regular , the author shows that there can not be an asymptotically - flat solution for @xmath11 unless @xmath10 vanishes",
    ". therefore the space - time is flat . in @xcite , a similar calculation",
    "when @xmath10 is regular only outside a certain radius leads to the conclusion that @xmath10 must be time - independent in order to have asymptotically - flat @xmath11 , and the space - time is stationary .",
    "in @xcite it was observed by integrating the einstein pseudotensor and matter energy - momentum tensor over a 4-dimensional volume that `` the mean value of power radiated by a periodic , asymptotically minkowskian gravitational field is equal to zero '' .",
    "the question of existence of periodic fields was left open . in @xcite",
    "the authors used the spin - coefficient formalism ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) to study the system of conformal einstein equations of friedrich @xcite .",
    "a coordinate system is based on two families of null hypersurfaces , incoming from past null infinity @xmath7 and labelled by constant @xmath12 and outgoing near @xmath7 and labeled by constant @xmath13 .",
    "the authors define periodicity as meaning periodic in @xmath12 in these coordinates and are then able to prove that , at @xmath7 , the @xmath13-derivatives of all orders of all components of the metric are independent of @xmath12 .",
    "they conclude that if the metric is analytic in these coordinates , then it necessarily has a killing vector , which in these coordinates is @xmath14 , at least in a neighbourhood of @xmath7 .",
    "thus any analytic metric , periodic in their sense , has such a killing vector . while certainly correct , there is a problem with this conclusion in that , by construction , the killing vector is null wherever it is defined , and reduces at @xmath7 to a constant translation along the generators .",
    "these are strong conditions and in fact no killing vector in flat space has these properties ( any null killing vector is necessarily a null translation , and a null translation is zero along one generator of @xmath15 ) becomes @xmath16 on @xmath7 , which vanishes at @xmath17 . ] .",
    "thus flat space is not periodic according to the definition of @xcite and nor is any of the familiar stationary , asymptotically flat solutions , for example the schwarzschild solution , so that this definition of periodicity is ` too strong ' .    for convenience ,",
    "we follow @xcite in working at @xmath7 rather than @xmath18 , though this is trivial to switch , but we shall make a weaker definition of ` periodic in time ' which will permit metrics stationary near @xmath7 and indeed will allow only these for analytic , asymptotically - flat vacuum or electrovac metrics .",
    "we follow the method of @xcite for both the vacuum and electrovac field equations , deferring other cases to a second article , but in a different coordinate and tetrad system .",
    "our coordinate and tetrad system is similar to the one used at @xmath15 in @xcite , and to prove the existence of a symmetry at the event horizon in @xcite and at a compact cauchy horizon in @xcite .",
    "we also differ from @xcite in the choice of conformal gauge . in @xcite",
    "the unphysical ricci scalar is set to zero by a choice of conformal factor obtained by solving a wave equation .",
    "however , the solution of the characteristic ivp for this wave equation as posed in @xcite will not in general be periodic , so that the rescaled , unphysical metric would not in general share the periodicity of the physical metric - in fact , in the particular case of the reissner - nordstrm solution this gauge choice is compatible with periodicity only for zero mass , as we show in appendix c. thus we assume that there is at least one conformal factor which is periodic and then modify this choice in the course of the calculation in order to simplify the spin coefficients . from this point on ,",
    "our method is then essentially the same as in @xcite , though a little more complicated , and we arrive at the same conclusion , but now with a killing vector which is time - like in the interior , at least near to @xmath7 .",
    "the condition of time - like periodicity which we impose is as follows : a space - time is time - like periodic if there is a discrete isometry taking any point of the physical space - time to a point in its chronological future . to define time - like periodicity at @xmath7 for an asymptotically - flat space - time",
    ", we require this isometry to extend to an isometry of a neighbourhood of @xmath19 which preserves the generators of @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , we require the existence of at least one @xmath20 which conformally compactifies the space - time and preserves the periodicity .",
    "the isometry has to be a supertranslation @xcite , @xmath21 on @xmath19 , in terms of the usual coordinates @xmath22 on @xmath7 and we shall assume that @xmath23 .",
    "( we could imagine allowing @xmath24 to vanish on some generators of @xmath7 , since as noted above periodicity along a null translation in flat space would appear like this at @xmath7 , but this would be null - periodicity rather than time - like periodicity . )",
    "we could assume further that @xmath24 is actually a positive constant but this turns out not to be necessary , as we shall find that , for analytic space - times , this assumption of periodicity necessarily leads to a space - time metric with a killing vector which , in coordinates to be defined , is @xmath14 and is time - like near @xmath7 .",
    "our result is    [ one ] a weakly - asymptotically simple , vacuum or electrovac , time - periodic space - time which is analytic in a neighbourhood of @xmath7 in the coordinates introduced below necessarily has a killing vector which is time - like in the interior and extends to a translation on @xmath7 .",
    "thus there are no _ non - trivial _ time - periodic solutions satisfying these conditions , in the sense that they would necessarily be actually time - independent if time - periodic . in a later article",
    ", we shall prove the corresponding result for the einstein equations coupled to either a massless scalar field with the usual energy - momentum tensor , or a solution of the conformally - invariant wave equation with the energy - momentum tensor from p125 of @xcite ( sometimes called the ` new improved energy momentum tensor ' ) .    the method of proof requires the assumption of analyticity .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there are vacuum solutions analytic near @xmath7 .",
    "however , one would like either to drop the assumption of analyticity , for example following the lead of @xcite or @xcite with a similar problem , or to prove that it follows from the assumptions of periodicity and asymptotic - flatness .",
    "it remains to be seen in what circumstances this can be done since , as noted above , there are non - analytic solutions with matter in periodic motion and matched to a ( static ) schwarzschild exterior .",
    "while this work is primarily motivated by an interest in the possibility or impossibility of helical motions , it is worth noting the connection with the question of the inheritance of symmetry .",
    "recall that , for a solution of einstein s field equations with matter , the matter is said to inherit the symmetry of the metric if any isometry of the metric is necessarily a symmetry of the matter .",
    "there are explicit solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations known for which an isometry of the metric is _ not _ a symmetry of the maxwell field @xcite but these solutions are not asymptotically - flat . in @xcite some other references may be found for explicit solutions with maxwell fields which do not share the symmetry of the metric .",
    "the same will be true for some robinson - trautman solutions with null electromagnetic field which may depend on time though the metric is static ( see @xcite ,  28.2 ) these solutions will very likely have wire singularities extending to infinity . from theorem [ one ]",
    "noninheritance can not happen with asymptotically - flat , analytic solutions :    [ two ] in any weakly - asymptotically simple , stationary electrovac space - time which is analytic in a neighbourhood of @xmath7 in the coordinates introduced below , the maxwell field is also stationary .",
    "one can raise the question of inheritance also for einstein - scalar field solutions but the answer is rather different : for a massive ( complex ) klein - gordon field there do exist solutions , the so - called ` boson stars ' , for which the metric is spherically - symmetric , asymptotically - flat and static but the scalar field has a phase linear in time ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; however these solutions are not analytic at infinity and , by a scaling argument , such solutions do not exist with massless scalar fields . in a later article , we shall obtain this result as a corollary of the result corresponding to theorem [ one ] .",
    "in that subsequent work we start from the conformal einstein field equations with a general energy - momentum tensor as a source and specialize them to scalar field cases .    in section [ confemeq ]",
    "we analyze the conformal einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "we first rewrite maxwell s equations in the unphysical space - time , then translate the physical bianchi identities and obtain differential equations for the unphysical weyl spinor and ricci spinor . in appendix",
    "a we summarize a number of quantities , their relations and behaviour under conformal transformations in the newman - penrose formalism ( @xcite ) ; these are extensively used in the main text and in appendices b and c. in particular , all conformal equations for the gravitational and electromagnetic field analyzed in terms of spinors in section [ confemeq ] are projected on the spin basis ( i.e. the null tetrad ) and written down in the newman - penrose formalism in appendix b. in section 3 a suitable coordinate system and a convenient newman - penrose null tetrad which gives special values to some of the newman - penrose spin - coefficients are introduced in the neighbourhood of @xmath7 . as noted above , these differ from those used by the authors of @xcite , and we shall show the differences explicitly in section 3 . in appendix c we demonstrate that in contrast to @xcite our choice of gauge admits simple static ( i.e. ` periodic ' ) space - times like flat space and the reissner - nordstrm metric . in section 4",
    "we follow @xcite ( although in a different conformal gauge ) and study the problem in the np formalism in the unphysical space - time , with data on @xmath7 . assuming periodicity along @xmath7 we first discover that the only possibility is the independence of all geometric quantities of an affine parameter @xmath12 along @xmath7 . by induction",
    "we then prove that all derivatives of all geometric quantities , including the physical metric components , in the direction into the physical space - time must also be @xmath25independent .",
    "the proof of theorem [ one ] and corollary [ two ] then follows from the assumed analyticity .",
    "this paper arose from a collaboration after p. t. posted his work @xcite on the gr - qc arxive and j. b. informed him that he and his phd .",
    "student m. s. were already engaged in tackling the same problem @xcite .",
    "we first introduce conformal equations for the gravitational and electromagnetic field in the formalism of 2-component spinors . in appendix b these equations are written down explicitly after the projection on a spin basis , in the form employed in the newman - penrose formalism . in the physical space - time , maxwell s equations without sources are simply and have values @xmath26 .",
