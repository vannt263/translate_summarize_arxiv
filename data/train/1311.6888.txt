    "are determined by the underlying density field at large scales , it serves as a direct probe of the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "there have been a lot of recent studies focusing on estimating bulk flow from a variety of observational probes , such as galaxy peculiar velocity survey @xcite , type ia supernovae data @xcite and galaxy clusters with observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite .",
    "however , amplitudes and directions of bulk flows at different depths in our local universe obtained from different measurements do not reach good convergence .",
    "some works have argued that the amplitude of the bulk flows they found is too high compared to the standard @xmath5 cold dark matter ( @xmath5cdm ) predictions @xcite , which has stimulated a lot of interest in looking for possible explanation in new physics @xcite .    however , any analysis which claims to strongly rule out the simple inflationary @xmath5cdm model should be subject to careful examination , since a confirmed large - scale flow would have profound impact on our understanding of the large - scale structure of the universe . @xcite and",
    "@xcite adopted the minimal variance weighting method to estimate bulk flows from their combined galaxy catalogues , declaring discovery of an excess power of flow @xmath6 towards @xmath7 , @xmath8 on a gaussian window of @xmath9 ( corresponds to a top - hat window function of @xmath10 ) .",
    "but , by correcting malmquist bias , selecting high - quality samples , and combining different data sets with the bayesian hyper - parameter method , @xcite found that there is no real excess power of flow on @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , and the estimated amplitude of density fluctuation @xmath15 is consistent with _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",

    "the minimal variance method is extended to include bulk flows in shells at different distances ( @xmath16@xmath17 ) and a likelihood function is formulated to combine all of these reconstructed shell velocities , the multishell likelihood method yields constraints on cosmological parameters of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( based on the spiral field _ i_-band catalogue , in abbreviation sfi++ ) , which are consistent with _ wmap _",
    "7-yr results very well @xcite .",
    "the recent estimation of bulk flow based on the ` first amendment ' compilation of 245 type ia supernovae found that bulk flow in the nearby universe ( a gaussian window of @xmath4 ) is of @xmath20 in the direction @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xcite , which is in good agreement with the expectation for the @xmath5cdm model ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "although the detailed analysis with the minimal variance and multishell likelihood methods in @xcite is in itself already a strong support to disperse the suspicion of a very large local bulk flow , it is still worthwhile to apply a different method to the same set of catalogues to check the robustness and reliability of the reconstructed bulk flow , and test the consistency between different methods . in this paper , we will use a different bulk flow reconstruction method , aka the maximum - likelihood method to calculate the bulk flows of several peculiar velocity catalogues .",
    "furthermore , we will compare the reconstructed flows with the theoretical prediction for the @xmath5cdm cosmology model and investigate the tendency of the cosmic flow as a function of sample depths with currently available peculiar velocity catalogues .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "theoretical prediction of bulk flow on various depths @xmath24 and the maximum - likelihood method are presented in section  [ sec : bulkflow ] .",
    "introduction to the peculiar velocity samples and malmquist bias correction is in section  [ sec : dataset ] , together with specification on calculating effective depth of a sample from the geometry of the peculiar velocity survey .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows the results of the constraints on the cosmic bulk flows by applying the likelihood function to the velocity catalogues , and the comparison against theoretical predictions .",
    "our conclusion is in the last section .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a spatially flat cosmology with _ wmap _ 7-yr best - fitting parameter values @xcite , i.e. fractional matter density @xmath25 , fractional baryon density @xmath26 , hubble constant @xmath27 , power - law index of scalar power spectrum @xmath28 and amplitude of fluctuation @xmath29 .",
    "in the linear theory of structure formation , the velocity field @xmath30 is related to the underlying density field by @xcite @xmath31where @xmath32 is the density contrast at position @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the logrithmic derivative of the linear growth rate @xcite and @xmath35 is the hubble parameter .",
    "since the bulk flow we investigate is the streaming motion of very nearby objects , and the samples are within distance of @xmath36 of our local volume , we take the cosmic time ` @xmath37 ' in eq .",
    "( [ pecu_def ] ) to be our present time @xmath38 , thus the hubble parameter becomes hubble constant @xmath39 at @xmath40 .",
    "the bulk flow @xmath41 is the coherent motion of observed galaxies or galaxy clusters .",
    "mathematically , @xmath42 is the velocity field filtered by the window function defined by the geometry of the observational sample , and is actually determined by mass distribution outside the sample space @xcite .",
    "the root - mean - square(hereafter rms ) of the bulk motion ( @xmath43 ) on scale of @xmath24 is the velocity power spectrum filtered by the observational window function @xcite @xmath44 where the @xmath45 is the fourier transform of the real space selection function with size @xmath24 . in linear regime ,",
    "the velocity power spectrum at present epoch @xmath40 is @xcite @xmath46 where the @xmath47 is the linear matter power spectrum which in our calculation is generated by the software package camb @xcite . substituting eq .",
    "( [ pvv2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ sigmav ] ) and adopting the simple top - hat window function @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the first spherical bessel function ) , the rms of bulk velocity in a spherical region @xmath24 becomes ( see also @xcite for derivation ) @xmath50 equation ( [ sigmav2 ] ) is the filtered velocity power spectrum in real space , which retains large - scale modes of perturbations .",
    "the bulk velocity rms of wider window is smaller than the one for narrower size window , because more modes are smeared out .",
    "typical rms of bulk velocity @xmath43 in @xmath5cdm model from top - hat window at @xmath51 is @xmath52 , while at @xmath53 is @xmath54 .",
    "now , given the filtered velocity rms on scale of @xmath24 ( eq .  ( [ sigmav2 ] ) ) , what is the probability distribution of the bulk flow magnitude on this scale ? to address this question , we start from the 3d probability function of the bulk flow velocities in cartesian coordinate .",
    "the cartesian components of bulk flow should be gaussian distributed , with zero means and variances of @xmath55 respectively , assuming null correlation between the three components , the probability distribution function of bulk flow @xmath41 is @xmath56 .",

    "so the amplitude of the bulk flow actually follows the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , which is skewed and has long tail on the large velocity branch .",
    "the peak of the distribution is @xmath59 , which is obtained by taking @xmath60 .",
    "one can also calculate the asymmetric variance of velocities on different depths @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] , we plot the peak and @xmath61 variance of the bulk velocity magnitude as a function of scale @xmath24 in solid line and dashed lines respectively .",
    "one can clearly see that the bulk motion amplitude decreases with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "this is because for the top - hat window function @xmath62 if @xmath63 , but @xmath64 if @xmath65 , the upper limit in eq .",
    "( [ sigmav ] ) is @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , a large volume ( large @xmath24 ) would result in a relatively small value of bulk flow rms .",
    "in addition , the smaller the scale is , the larger the variance of the bulk flow is .",
    "this is the effect of the sample variance , because if the velocity field is filtered on a smaller scale , larger variance of this filtered velocity will be .",
    "if one averages the peculiar velocity over the whole universe ( @xmath67 ) , the average velocity should be fairly close to zero , if the primordial perturbations are adiabatic gaussian as assumed in the concordance @xmath5cdm model .",
    "we need to mention that , the model of equations  ( [ pvv2 ] ) and ( [ sigmav2 ] ) for peculiar velocity and subsequent bulk flow is made under the ` single - particle ' assumption , i.e. the galaxies do not strongly correlate with each other and therefore maxwellian - boltzmann distribution can be used to describe its behaviour . since for our peculiar velocity catalogues ,",
    "the data are quite sparse and not very correlated on small scales , our assumption is a good approximation . , in which case the correlation energy only takes around @xmath68 per cent of the total kinetic energy . ] on the other hand , in the regime where gravitational clustering of the galaxies and their collisions can not be negligible , one needs to look in to the scale dependence of the small - scale modes and then consider the correlation between small and large scales ( i.e. the gravitational quasi - equilibrium distribution method @xcite ) . since we are most interested in large - scale bulk flows of which the small - scale velocity dispersion is smoothed out , we will not get involved into details of gravitational clustering properties in this paper .",
    "now , let us move on to the issue of computing the likelihood of the magnitude and direction of the bulk flow .",
    "in general , for a peculiar velocity survey with @xmath69 number of objects ( galaxies , galaxy clusters or type ia supernovae ) , of the @xmath70th object we can obtain its redshift @xmath71 , distance @xmath72 ( utilizing the empirical relation such as tully - fisher relation or the fundamental plane method , see section  [ sec : catalogue ] ) , the line of sight velocity @xmath73 and its measurement error @xmath74 , and the galactic longitude and latitude @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "the line of sight component @xmath73 of peculiar velocity is related to redshift ( @xmath71 ) and distance ( @xmath72 ) as @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "given the bulk motion @xmath41 of objects in the sample , the residual line of sight velocity of the @xmath70th object after subtracting out the bulk motion is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the projected component of @xmath41 on to the direction of line of sight . and @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is summed over @xmath82,@xmath83,@xmath84 in @xmath85 .",

    "is related to the distance measurement error by @xmath89 ( linear propagation of uncertainties ) . ] finally , the likelihood for @xmath41=(@xmath90 ) is constructed as @xcite @xmath91then we transform eq .",
    "( [ likexyz ] ) into the spherical coordinate system to give the joint likelihood of magnitude @xmath42 , direction angle @xmath92 and @xmath93 ,    @xmath94 .",

    "in each mock catalogue , we simulate 100 type - ia supernovae data as one data set .",
    "the way we simulate each data set is as follows .",
    "we assume that in each data set , the supernovae share a bulk flow velocity ( @xmath95 ) towards the direction of ( @xmath96,@xmath97 ) , is the angle measured from @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is the azimuthal angle measured from @xmath100 . in galactic coordinate ,",
    "the angles are @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and we choose this arbitrary direction just for simulation tests .",
    "] while each line of sight velocity has @xmath103 random motion .",
    "we also take the measurement error of 100 samples in the `` first amendment type - ia supernovae '' ( in abbreviation ` a1sn ' ) catalogue ( see section  [ sec : catalogue ] ) as the measurement errors in our simulated data sets because these quoted errors are realistic representatives of the noise of type - ia supernovae .",
    "therefore , in each mock catalogue , we simulate the line of sight velocity of 100 type - ia supernovae samples , which share a streaming motion while each has both random error and measurement error .",
    "we then use each mock catalogue to constrain ( @xmath104 ) parameters , and plot the marginalized likelihood of each parameter .",
    "the constraints from four mock catalogues are demonstrated with green , black , blue and brown lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : liketest ] .",
    "all of these distribution functions are centred around the input value of the parameters , the scattering of their peak positions is determined by the number of each sample , which scales as @xmath105 with @xmath69 being the number of objects in the mock .",
    "in addition , the width of each distribution is determined by the measurement noise and intrinsic dispersion , as they get smaller , the width of distribution becomes narrower .",
    "we choose to simulate 100 samples in each mock catalogue is because the simulation and the maximum - likelihood analysis can be complete at relatively light expense of computing . indeed , averaging the likelihoods of 300 mock catalogues , we find that the average distribution ( red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : liketest ] ) perfectly peaks at the input values of preset parameters , which at least numerically prove that the maximum - likelihood method ( eq .  ( [ likev ] ) ) can produce unbiased estimates of the bulk flow .",
    "there are other methods designed to measure bulk flow from peculiar velocity surveys than the maximum - likelihood method .",
    "the ` all space constrained estimate ' ( asce , @xcite ) is one of such methods .",
    "the method is proposed in consideration of the observational limitation that distance indicators of peculiar velocity survey , such as tully - fisher relation and the fundamental plane method , can only probe a small fraction of galaxies around our local volume ( @xmath106 ) @xcite . to overcome this problem",
    ", the asce method first generates large number of realizations of gaussian random velocity fields based on the velocity power spectrum , these simulations are averaged to obtain a series of basis functions of bulk motion .",
    "then they fit these basis of bulk motion with the apparent magnitude and line width of inverse tully - fisher relation to estimate coefficients of these basis . from these measured coefficients",
    ", one can therefore reconstruct the bulk flow in our real local universe .",
    "@xcite confirmed the validity of this method with their mock catalogues .",
    "another method , proposed by @xcite , is to use the galaxy luminosity function at different redshifts to fit the bulk flow velocity .",
    "redshifts of the object may be biased by the kaiser rocket effect , @xcite provides an analytical tool to correct this bias , and claims that it can lead to an unbiased reconstruction of bulk flows .",
    "we will compare our reconstruction of the bulk flow with those found in previous studies @xcite in section  [ sec : reconstruct ] .",
    "four different peculiar velocity catalogues from recent surveys are adopted to estimate bulk flows .",
    "the four samples are _ e_arly - type _ near_by galaxies ( in abbreviation enear , characteristic depth @xmath107 , typical distance error @xmath108 per cent ; @xcite ) , sfi++ ( @xmath109,@xmath110 per cent ; @xcite ) , a1sn ( @xmath111 per cent ; @xcite ) and sc catalogue ( @xmath112 per cent ; @xcite ) . for details of these samples , including characteristic depths , typical distance errors and data compilation , please refer to section  3 of @xcite and section  2 of @xcite .    in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", there are five other catalogues employed , namely the sbf @xcite , sn @xcite , smac @xcite , efar @xcite and willick sample @xcite . here",
    "we opt to abandon these five catalogues , and the reasons are as follows . for smac , efar and willick , these samples are either very distant , in which case the distance errors are very large , or too sparse to support robust estimation , and their survey geometry is so complicated that make it hard to measure . in addition , as the survey goes deeper , the simple model of assuming gaussian errors of distances is almost certainly inappropriate , and will become a dominant systematic effect in the distance estimation ; velocity data beyond @xmath113 are thus too noisy to reliably reconstruct bulk flow . for sbf data ,",
    "it is too close to our own galaxy , some galxies fall into our local non - linear structures , therefore it could strongly bias our estimation of bulk velocity on large scales . since we will use the newly compiled a1sn catalogue ( see @xcite and @xcite ) which includes three type - ia supernovae data sets , we will not use its old sub data set , the sn set @xcite , in our study .",
    "in the catalogues described above , there are three different classes of distance indicators , the tully - fisher relation ( sfi++ , sc ) , the fundamental plane method ( enear ) and the type - ia sn luminosity function ( a1sn ) .",
    "these distance indicators all have their intrinsic errors . for tully - fisher selected samples , such as sfi++ and sc , their distance errors are around @xmath114 per cent , which is slightly larger than the distance error of the fundamental plane - selected enear sample ( @xmath115 per cent ) . for type - ia supernovae data ,",
    "the luminosity function can be used to calibrate the distance in better precision , the distance errors of a1sn catalogue are only @xmath116 per cent .",
    "the uncertainty of distance indicators , especially for tully - fisher and fundamental plane - selected objects , suggests that an object with its measured distance @xmath117 may actually deviate from its true distance by a broad range of possible values .",
    "this is the effect of malmquist bias @xcite , which characterizes the fact that inhomogeneous distribution of matter and distance ( or magnitude ) errors can in general bias the distance ( magnitude ) measurement . as a result ,",
    "the probability function of the true distance @xmath118 given the measured distance @xmath117 strongly depends on the intrinsic errors of distance indicators , and the underlying density distribution @xcite .",
    "taking the _ iras_-psc@xmath84 ( point source catalogue with redshift ) catalogue which probes the full - sky underlying density field out to @xmath119 as the model of cosmic matter distribution , we follow the guideline in section 3.1 of @xcite and section 2.3 of @xcite to correct malmquist bias for a1sn , sc and enear catalogues .",
    "note that the sfi++ catalogue @xcite is already corrected for malmquist bias .",
    "once the malmquist bias is corrected , our next step is to select samples . in the four catalogues ,",
    "objects with distance beyond @xmath17 are very sparse and suffer from large errors due to uncertainties in the distance indicators , which are consequently discarded from the sample .",
    "additionally , several sfi++ galaxies with @xmath120 are strongly affected by local non - linear structures , showing very large velocities @xcite , we also excluded these high - velocity members ( @xmath121 ) from the sfi++ catalogue since they are clearly close to some local non - linear structures .",
    "our final samples for the maximum - likelihood analysis are listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    ".final samples for analysis extracted from the four peculiar velocity catalogues .",
    "the first two columns give the number of galaxies within the range @xmath122 ( used in this paper ) and @xmath123 ( considered as outliers ) .",
    "the last three columns delimit geometry of samples after malmquist bias correction and selection , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the minimal and maximal distances of samples in unit of @xmath126 , @xmath127 defines the cut - off region in galactic latitude for each survey .

    "we plot our results of the constraints ( table  [ tab2 ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] together with the predictions of the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "the solid line is the peak ( @xmath128 ) of the distribution ( eq .  ( [ pveq ] ) ) , and the dashed lines are the @xmath129 confidence interval .",
    "one can see that the data are consistent with the expectation for the @xmath5cdm cosmology .",
    "note that the sfi++ catalogue , with its nearly full - sky coverage and dense sampling , provides the tightest constraint of the bulk flow amplitude .",
    "in addition , by comparing our constraints with the other studies in table 1 and the earlier works @xcite by using mark iii and shallflow catalogues , we can see that they all provide constraints on bulk flow amplitude ( @xmath130 ) on scales of @xmath9 that are consistent with the prediction for the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "if the data are improved by prospective new surveys , such as 6df survey @xcite or square kilometer array @xcite , the data can be used to constrain any possible deviation from general relativity , i.e. the standard gravity theory .",
    "this is because any alternative theory of gravity would change the growth rate of structure , which will boost or diminish the power of the velocity field on intermediate scales ( @xmath131 ) ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) . while doing the constraints on the modified gravity model , one needs to keep in mind of the sample variance at different scales , which is plotted as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] . for each scale @xmath24",
    ", there is a certain level of uncertainty of fluctuations which reflects the variation of the number of velocity modes filtered by the window function .",
    "the sample variance limits the capacity of the reconstructed bulk flow to infer the underlying physics , one needs to consider this variance term in the full covariance matrix when the bulk flow is used to constrain cosmology .",
    "as introduced in section  [ intro ] , bulk flow is the coherent motion of sampled galaxies , galaxy clusters or supernovae , which can be used as a test of the growth of structure .",
    "yet there are some tentative observational evidences from the peculiar velocity surveys and the cmb observation suggesting possible excess power on scales around @xmath11 ( in radius ) . here",
    ", we show that data of current peculiar velocity surveys actually do not provide strong evidence against the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "in this paper we adopted a maximum - likelihood method to peculiar velocity catalogues for the bulk flow estimation .",
    "different from just using the ` peak ' of the maximum - likelihood method as in @xcite , we employ the full likelihood function with simulated data sets and the state - of - the - art peculiar velocity survey . numerical test with simulations",
    "indicates that the estimator is unbiased in the limit that no complicated survey geometry is involved , which is approximately true for the four catalogues .",
    "we apply our likelihood function to the four catalogues , enear , sfi++ , a1sn and sc all of which are malmquist bias corrected and properly trimmed , to obtain the magnitude and direction of the bulk flows .",
    "we find : ( 1 ) for the largest and densest tully - fisher selected catalogue , sfi++ survey constrain the magnitude of bulk flow as @xmath1 towards @xmath2 at an effective depth of @xmath132 , @xmath133 ; ( 2 ) for the largest fundamental plane selected catalogue , enear samples constrain the bulk flow as @xmath134 towards @xmath135 , @xmath136 at an effective depth @xmath137 .",
    "directions of the bulk flow we find here are well consistent with the previous probes , while amplitudes of estimated bulk flows confirm an earlier investigation with the same data sets but different estimation method @xcite .    from the geometry of the selected peculiar velocity samples , incorporating the radial distribution of sampled objects , we calculate the effective depth for the four velocity samples .",
