    "in our previous paper  @xcite , we have formulated in formal and abstract ways _ @xmath0-fold supersymmetry _ in quantum mechanics  @xcite and investigated general properties of the models which possess this symmetry .",

    "we have shown that @xmath0-fold supersymmetric models have a lot of significant properties similar to the ordinary supersymmetric ones  @xcite such as degenerate spectral structure between bosonic states and fermionic ones , non - renormalization theorems for the generalized witten index and for a part of the spectra , and so on .",
    "furthermore , we have introduced the notion of _ quasi - solvability _ to identify an important aspect of @xmath0-fold supersymmetry and have proved the equivalence between @xmath0-fold supersymmetry and quasi - solvability .",
    "recently , we have further shown  @xcite that _ type a _ subclass of @xmath0-fold supersymmetry which was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is equivalent to the quasi - solvable models constructed by @xmath1 generators  @xcite .",
    "then , it has turned out that the equivalence between them for special cases which had been reported previously in refs .",
    "@xcite is generically holds .",
    "quasi - solvability means the existence of a finite dimensional invariant subspace under the action of the hamiltonian . as a consequence ,",
    "a part of the spectra can be solved by a finite dimensional algebraic equation . in the case where the subspace is physical ,",
    "that is , @xmath2 , these spectra give the _ true _ eigenvalues of the hamiltonian .",
    "in this case , the system is often called _ quasi - exactly solvable _  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the subspace is not physical , solvable spectra only give _ perturbative _ eigenvalues at most and thus we have dubbed this case _ quasi - perturbatively solvable _  @xcite .",
    "this distinction is quite important , especially in view of dynamical @xmath0-fold supersymmetry breaking ; @xmath0-fold supersymmetry is broken dynamically if a system is quasi - perturbatively solvable while it is not broken if a system is quasi - exactly solvable .    in this article ,",
    "we analyze particular models which can be @xmath0-fold supersymmetric more quantitatively . previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , an asymmetric quartic double - well potential was investigated in detail by the valley method  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the system possesses @xmath0-fold supersymmetry at specific values of a parameter in the hamiltonian where the leading borel singularity of the perturbative corrections for the first @xmath0-th energies disappear .",
    "this result is a consequence of a general property of @xmath0-fold supersymmetry , namely , the non - renormalization theorem .",
    "it was also shown that the non - perturbative corrections for the first @xmath0-th energies do not vanish even when the system becomes @xmath0-fold supersymmetric .",
    "this result consistently reflects the fact that , in the case of an asymmetric quartic double - well potential , the solvable subspace is not physical , that is , the system is quasi - perturbatively solvable ; non - vanishing non - perturbative effects break @xmath0-fold supersymmetry dynamically .",
    "these observations show that combining with the formal discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite quantitative analyses may give deeper and complement understanding on dynamical properties of the @xmath0-fold supersymmetric models .",
    "as in the case of the ordinary supersymmetric models , non - perturbative analyses are quite important in the @xmath0-fold supersymmetric case ; dynamical @xmath0-fold supersymmetry breaking can take place via purely non - perturbative effects , e.g. , quantum tunneling .",
    "however , non - perturbative analyses are in general quite non - trivial even in the simple one - dimensional quantum mechanics .",
    "the valley method is one of the most successful tools for this kind of purpose .",
    "so we fully employ it in this work .",
    "the article organizes as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the general results and properties of the type a subclass of @xmath0-fold supersymmetry  @xcite . in section [ sec : speci ] , we develop particular cases of the type a models which are especially relevant for the analyses in this article .",
    "sections [ sec : aexpo ] and [ sec : acubi ] are devoted to valley method analyses on a periodic and a sextic triple - well potential , respectively .",
    "we choose potentials to be investigated so that the systems can be type a @xmath0-fold supersymmetric at specific values of a parameter involved in the potentials .",
    "the way of the choice enables us to clarify the characteristic features of type a @xmath0-fold supersymmetry .",
    "the periodic potential is always quasi - exactly solvable when type a @xmath3-fold supersymmetric while the triple - well potential can be either quasi - exactly or quasi - perturbatively solvable . in both the cases we show that the disappearance of the leading borel singularity occurs .",
    "however , the non - perturbative corrections vanish when and only when the systems are quasi - exactly solvable .",

    "( [ eqn : e2cu2 ] ) is applied for the odd - parity states labeled by the quantum number @xmath364 and results in @xmath365 for all @xmath345 . it should be noted that in the case of @xmath366 @xmath360 the non - perturbative corrections do remain although the models are @xmath0-fold supersymmetric , reflecting the fact that they are only quasi - perturbatively solvable but are not quasi - exactly solvable .",
    "these results are just what we have expected from the general properties of @xmath0-fold supersymmetry .",
    "the large order behavior of the perturbation series in @xmath278 for the spectra can be estimated by the same way as in the case of the double - well and periodic potentials . from the non - perturbative contributions eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : e2cu1])([eqn : e2cu4 ] ) , we can easily see that the imaginary parts of them are continuous , at least up to the order @xmath237 , in @xmath153 and yield ,    [ eqns : imecus ] @xmath367    which are valid for arbitrary @xmath153 .",

    "( [ eqns : lobpcus ] ) , we can find the disappearance of the leading divergence takes place only when @xmath371 @xmath372 .",
    "more precisely , we obtain the following results :    1 .",

    "( [ eqn : epvnfc ] ) , we see that the above cases completely coincide with the case where the system possesses type a @xmath0-fold supersymmetry .",
    "again , the results of the valley method analyses are consistent with the non - renormalization theorem .",
    "in this article , we have made non - perturbative analyses on the models which can be @xmath0-fold supersymmetric at specific values of the parameter . combining the results obtained in this article with the ones in ref .",
    "@xcite , we get the following :    1 .   for all the potentials investigated ( double - well",
    ", triple - well , periodic ) , the leading divergence of the perturbation series disappears when and only when they are @xmath0-fold supersymmetric .",
    "the non - renormalization theorem ensures that @xmath0-fold supersymmetry is sufficient for the disappearance of the divergence .",
    "the results indicate that it may also be necessary .",
    "the non - perturbative corrections to the spectra for certain states vanish when and only when the models are quasi - exactly solvable ( triple - well , periodic ) .",
    "3 .   for the quasi - perturbatively solvable potentials ( double - well",
    ", triple - well ) , the non - perturbative corrections remain although they are @xmath0-fold supersymmetric .    as was mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite the quasi - solvable models constructed by @xmath1 generators do not always have normalizable solvable states .",
    "although the conditions on the normalizability of the models were fully investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , it remains unclear what is the role of the partial algebraization of the models without normalizable solvable states .",
    "the results listed above provide an answer to this problem . even though the solvable wave functions are not normalizable , they can be normalizable and thus make sense in the perturbation theory . in this case",
    ", the spectra corresponding to the solvable states also make sense in the perturbation theory . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the perturbation series for them are convergent since they are the solutions of a finite order algebraic equation .",
    "however , the fact that the solvable states and the corresponding spectra make sense only in the perturbation theory inevitably means the existence of the non - perturbative effects , which is in contrast to the case of the quasi - exactly solvable models .",
    "that is why we have called the case quasi - perturbatively solvable .",
    "finally , we would like to mention about applicability of the dilute - gas approximation .",
    "as has been mentioned previously , the dilute - gas approximation can not give proper results , that is , consistent results with @xmath0-fold supersymmetry , for both the potentials eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : exppo ] ) and ( [ eqn : cubpo ] ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that the success of the dilute - gas approximation for the symmetric double - well potential is rather exceptional and applicability of it is quite limited .",
