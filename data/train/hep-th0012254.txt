    "we can also realize three - dimensional gauge theories as theories on d2-branes@xcite .",
    "for example , an @xmath2 @xmath4 gauge theory with @xmath5 flavors is realized on a d2-brane in @xmath5 d6-branes background .",
    "however , unlike the hanany - witten type configurations , we come up against a problem if we attempt to introduce a chern - simons term .",
    "the d2-brane action involves the following term@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a cosmological constant quantized in integer units . because we need to use this coupling to introduce a nonzero chern - simons coupling",
    ", we should put d2-branes in a massive iia or , equivalently , a d8-brane background . if we put a d2-brane parallel to a d8-brane",
    ", however , the configuration becomes non - bps and unstable . in order to keep supersymmetries unbroken",
    ", we have to take one direction on the d2-brane to be a dilatonic direction perpendicular to the d8-brane .",
    "although @xmath8 supersymmetry is realized in this case , the three - dimensional poincar invariance is broken@xcite .    in @xcite open string spectra and bps conditions of d@xmath9-d@xmath10 systems",
    "are studied and it is pointed out that d@xmath9-d(@xmath11 ) systems can be made bps by turning on a constant @xmath1-field .",
    "recently , mihailescu , park and tran@xcite and witten@xcite take advantage of this fact to study gauge theories on d - branes",
    ". in this paper , inspired by their idea , we study a relation between a d2-d8 configuration with a non - zero @xmath1-field and a maxwell - chern - simons - higgs system expected to be realized on the d2-brane .",

    "the equation of motion for the gauge field is @xmath30 because the second term on the left hand side plays a role of a ` mass term ' of the gauge field , we should introduce mass terms also for other component fields in the vector multiplet in order to make the action supersymmetric .",
