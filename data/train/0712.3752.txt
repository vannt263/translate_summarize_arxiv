    "it is a well - known fact that the ground - state and the vacuum noise level of a harmonic oscillator and a mode of the radiation field , respectively , is required to fulfill the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "in fact , this noise level just defines the minimum uncertainty level of the quantum noise which is required to obey the uncertainty principle .",
    "it is important to note that the uncertainty principle sets a limit for the product of the variances of two observables , such as position and momentum of a harmonic oscillator and two orthogonal field quadratures for a radiation mode .",
    "therefore it is a natural conclusion that one may find quantum states , for which the noise in one of the chosen pair of observables is reduced below the vacuum ( or ground - state ) noise level , at the expense of increased noise in the other observable @xcite .",
    "nowadays such states are usually called squeezed states , in the early days of their study also the notion two - photon coherent states was used  @xcite , since the structure of the unitary operator which leads to such state is formally a two - photon generalization of the coherent displacement operator .",
    "more than twenty years ago that the first successful experimentell realization of squeezed radiation fields have been published @xcite",
    ". there has been some interest in possible applications of the noise reduction in a given observable , for example in the context of interferometric detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "it could be shown that the squeezing effect indeed improves interferometric @xcite and spectroscopic measurements @xcite .",
    "very recently squeezing could be realized with a reduction of the noise power by 10 db @xcite , which makes the squeezed states indeed useful for gravitational wave astronomy .    based on this encouraging progress in the generation and application of the so - called quadrature squeezed states , it is of some interest to rise the question of whether one may consider useful generalizations of the concept of squeezed states .",
    "for example , generalization of squeezing has been proposed , which is based on the uncertainty relation of two general non - commuting observables  @xcite .",
    "the further investigation of squeezing in such a general sense is closely connected with the minimization of the uncertainty relation of two hermitian operators .",
    "the problem of finding such generalized squeezed states requires to solve the minimization problem of the uncertainty relation for the two hermitian operators defining the squeezing under consideration .",
    "the resulting minimum uncertainty states are then the generalized squeezed states .",
    "generalized squeezing in this sense has been considered for some special choices of the basic operators , such as amplitude - squared squeezing @xcite and its higher - order generalizations @xcite , for a review see also @xcite .",
    "other generalizations of quadrature squeezing were based on the consideration of higher - order moments  @xcite , and on higher powers of the annihilation / creation operators in the squeeze operator  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we will consider minimum - uncertainty squeezed states for two general noncommuting observables .",
    "pure quantum states which fulfill this requirement will be constructed as the solutions of an eigenvalue problem , which can be analytically solved only in a few special cases , including quadrature squeezing and amplitude squared squeezing . for more general choices of the two hermitian operators ,",
    "we develop a systematic approach to find such states numerically in the fock - bargmann representation .",
    "this method is applied to other types of squeezed states , such as  generalized quadrature squeezed states and deformed nonlinear squeezed states .",
    "it allows one to obtain and characterize the optimized squeezed states for a chosen observable .",
    "this may provide a powerful tool for optimizing a given measurement principle with respect to the relevant level of quantum noise .",
