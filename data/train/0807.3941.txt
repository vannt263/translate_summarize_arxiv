    "it is well - known that the solutions for the vlasov equation are arbitrary functions of the invariants ( constants of motion ) of the system . in the stationary case ,",
    "this property allows us to construct the so - called bernstein - greene - kruskal equilibria @xcite for the vlasov - poisson system for the classical plasma . on the other hand , it is much more difficult to derive exact solutions for the corresponding quantum model , namely the wigner equation or , in the self - consistent case , the wigner - poisson system . indeed ,",
    "even if the classical problem is integrable , the stationary wigner function is not , in general , a function of the classical invariants .",
    "this follows since the wigner time - evolution equation does not preserve the classical constants of motion .",
    "therefore , to date , there is a lack of exact solutions for the wigner and wigner - poisson equations .",
    "the better results in this regard are approximate solutions @xcite@xcite that have been obtained as the first order quantum correction to the vlasov - poisson equilibria .",
    "the quantum bernstein - greene - kruskal modes have been defined as the solutions of the wigner - poisson system under the periodic boundary conditions @xcite , but the explicit construction of these solutions is still a challenge .",
    "notice that the original article by wigner @xcite , where he introduces his celebrated function , considers the first - order quantum correction , to a maxwell - boltzmann thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "in addition , quantum like corrections were proposed for charged - particle beam transport @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop explicit exact solutions of the wigner equation , in a particular form that is described in section ii .",
    "both the external and self - consistent potential cases are treated . in a sense",
    ", we develop a quantum analogue of the bernstein - greene - kruskal equilibria in the phase space .",
    "of course , exact stationary wigner functions can be found after applying the wigner transform to the previously known energy eigenstates , if available .",
    "however , the question is to derive solutions for the wigner equation considered in itself , without reference to the schrdinger equation or the nature of the quantum statistical mixture of the system .",
    "here we propose a special functional _ ansatz _ , as a function of the energy and the position , for the wigner function in a conservative system .",
    "the technique is illustrated for a quartic anharmonic oscillator case and for the self - consistent wigner - poisson system .",
    "the derived solutions are the first explicit exact solutions of the wigner equation for nonlinear systems , constructed independently of the schrdinger formalism . in this way",
    ", we can have insight on the relation between the classical constants of motion and the solutions of the stationary wigner equation . in this regard ,",
    "it is already well known @xcite that for a quadratic hamiltonian there is a close relationship between the ermakov - lewis invariant , which is the basic classical constant of motion of the problem , and the wigner function .",
    "however , for a quadratic hamiltonian the wigner equation reduces to the classical ( vlasov ) equation , with the quantum effect restricted to the initial conditions .    the work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we consider a quartic nonlinear oscillator problem and derive quantum phase space structures by using our _ ansatz _ generalizing the bernstein - greene - kruskal solutions for the classical system . in section iii , the approach is adapted to the wigner - poisson system , which is related to a quantum plasma system .",
    "section iv is reserved to the conclusions .",
    "the wigner equation @xcite in one spatial dimension with a potential @xmath0 reads @xmath1\\,f(x , v',t ) \\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the wigner pseudo - probability distribution and all quantities have their usual meaning .",
    "the formal classical limit ( @xmath3 ) of the wigner equation is the vlasov equation , with the wigner function playing the role of the probability distribution function . even assuming negative values in some regions of phase space , the wigner function can be used to compute the macroscopic quantities like the density and the current , in the same way as a faithful distribution function .",
    "in addition to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , a genuine wigner function should correspond to a positive definite density matrix .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 must satisfy @xcite at least the following necessary conditions , @xmath5 equation ( [ c1 ] ) is just a normalization condition , while eqs .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) and ( [ c4 ] ) arise because the spatial and velocity densities should be non - negative everywhere . finally , eq . ( [ c2 ] )",
    "is needed to avoid violation of the uncertainty principle , ruling out a too spiky function @xmath2 .    in the stationary case",
    ", one would be tempted to use the conservation of the energy to construct exact solutions for eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . however , except in the somewhat restricted case where the wigner function is a linear function of the energy @xcite , the wigner equation is not satisfied by functions of the energy alone . to illustrate our technique , we consider the anharmonic potential @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a numerical parameter and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are parameters with dimension of angular frequency and wavenumber , respectively",
    ". plots of the potential are shown in figure 1 , showing a single nonlinear potential well or a double - well potential , according to the values of @xmath10 .",
    "the coefficients were chosen to match the expansion of a pendulum - like potential @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "a similar form was considered in connection with the numerical simulation of quantum echoes described by the wigner equation @xcite .        for the chosen potential , in the stationary case ( @xmath12 ) , the wigner equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is @xmath13 if there was no nonlinearity , eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) would be the stationary vlasov equation for the simple harmonic oscillator whose solutions are arbitrary functions of the energy .",
    "however , in the quantum and nonlinear case , the higher - order velocity derivative term prevents the existence of a solution as a function of the energy only .",
    "notice that the term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) can assume large values : it is not necessarily just a quantum correction .",
    "higher - order ( in @xmath14 ) terms would appear for higher anharmonicities .",

    "( [ eq7 ] ) is zero and the solution is simply @xmath22 , with an arbitrary functional dependence , in the same spirit of the bernstein - greene - kruskal solutions for the classical plasma . the difficulties with eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) are in the entangled character of the quantum term , which prevents the use of the separation of variables technique , for instance .",
    "it is also apparent that if @xmath23 , then any linear function of the energy would be a solution .",

    "the wigner function automatically has a gaussian shape in velocity space .",
    "otherwise , for @xmath28 , one can have a two - stream type wigner function , double - humped in velocity space , at least for specific parameters .",
    "notice that the proposed solution does not distinguish between the trapped and untrapped particles .",
    "this is another different feature in comparison to the bernstein - greene - kruskal method .    after inserting eq .",

    "if @xmath37 , then the wigner function is certainly gaussian in velocity space .    in the double - well potential case , when @xmath38 , the exact solution is real and bounded provided @xmath39",

    ", we assume that there are no scattering states , so that @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the wigner function has a gaussian shape in the momentum space and an abrupt localization in configuration space , as can be seen more clearly in figure 3 for the same parameters and for different rescaled velocities @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "these strongly localized structures do not have classical counterpart .",
    "observe that the necessary conditions in eqs .",
    "( [ d1])-([d2 ] ) are also satisfied .",
    "in particular , @xmath49 .            when @xmath50 , the wigner function is regular provided @xmath39 .",
    "then , we can have a more rich variety of behaviors .",
    "for instance , for @xmath51 , there is a two - humped distribution in velocity space , provided @xmath52 .",
    "figure 4 shows the wigner function in momentum space , for fixed position @xmath53 , with the same parameters and several values of @xmath54 .",
    "one sees that for increasing quantum effects there is a progressive depth of the exact solution , which eventually becomes negative for @xmath55 .",
    "notice that , in principle , there is no limiting value of @xmath54 , since the solution is non perturbative .",
    "however , for a physically meaningful positive particle spatial density @xmath56 \\left(\\frac{a}{|c| } +   \\mu a ( q^2 - \\frac{q^4}{12 } ) + 2b\\right)\\ ] ] there are extra restrictions , even recognizing that in general the wigner function is not a positive definite quantity .",
    "for instance , when @xmath57 , @xmath58 for all @xmath31 imposes that @xmath59 .",
    "for these parameters , the other necessary conditions in eqs .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) , ( [ d4 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) are also fulfilled , as can be checked after numerically performing the spatial integrations .",
    "actually , a detailed calculation shows that when @xmath50 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for a positive definite particle density the exact wigner function can not be a two - stream type distribution . on the other hand , for @xmath50 and non negative @xmath35 ( in which case",
    "the distribution function is not two - humped in momentum space ) , in principle one can have arbitrarily large values of @xmath54 .",
    "the opposite behavior arises when @xmath38 and @xmath62 . in this case",
    ", it can be proved that a positive definite particle density implies a two - humped wigner function in momentum space .",
    "for instance , at the origin @xmath53 , the condition for @xmath63 reads @xmath64 and this inequality can be shown to imply that the wigner function admits two minima in velocity space , as illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "notice the opposite concavity in comparison to the @xmath65 case .",
    "in the same figure , we show the particle density , which has a deep centered at the origin but is positive definite , even with the wigner function admitting negative values .",
    "now , it can happen that the quantum effect comes in favor of a physically meaningful solution , since @xmath58 for all @xmath31 provided @xmath54 is sufficiently large .",
    "for instance , from eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) it follows that @xmath63 if @xmath66 and @xmath54 is large enough .",
    "in particular , for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , one needs @xmath69 .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath70 for these parameters and several values of @xmath54 .",
    "one sees that the two maxima of the particle density tend to approximate each other as the quantum parameter increases .",
    "also , the minimum and maximum values of @xmath70 increases as quantum effects becomes larger .",
    "however , @xmath54 ca nt be arbitrarily large , since the solution becomes too localized in phase space for increasing @xmath54 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath71 ( figure 6 , right , bottom ) , we have @xmath72 , violating eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) . in conclusion , in each specific case the necessary conditions ( [ d1])([d2 ] ) must be checked .",
    "now consider the self - consistent case where the potential is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the elementary charge and @xmath75 is the electrostatic potential satisfying the poisson equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the permittivity constant and @xmath78 a background ion number density .",
    "coupled to the wigner equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) compose the wigner - poisson system @xcite . for the latter , it is convenient to search for solutions in the form @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the energy and @xmath81 is the electron number density , as defined in eq .",

    "( [ eq14 ] ) , the scalar potential is interpreted as a function of the electron number density . this is locally possible using @xmath85 , according to the implicit function theorem , provided @xmath81 is not identically a constant . now",

    "the explicit form in terms of position ( @xmath104 ) could also be found , through the poisson equation .        in the wigner - poisson case ,",
