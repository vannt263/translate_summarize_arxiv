    "classical double radio sources , also known as frii radio sources ( fanaroff & riley , 1974 ) , have been extensively studied .",
    "numerous surveys of radio sources as well as detailed studies of individual sources have provided a wealth of radio data on many sources .",
    "theoretical models for the sources developed and discussed by various authors ( blandford & rees , 1974 ; scheuer , 1974 , 1982 ; begelman , blandford , & rees , 1984 ; begelman & cioffi , 1989 ; eilek & shore 1989 ; gopal - krishna & wiita 1991 ; daly 1990 , 2000 ) lend much understanding to the physics of the sources .",
    "it is believed that frii sources are powered by highly collimated outflows from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , and that the radio emission from these sources is the result of an interaction between the beam , or jet , and the ambient medium . as a result , careful study of frii sources",
    "can yield very useful information about the frii sources , their environments , and their central engines ( e.g. daly 2000 ) .",
    "daly ( 1994 , 1995 ) presents a model for powerful extended frii sources and showed how key parameters of an frii source and its environment , such as the beam power and the ambient gas density , can be estimated using multi - frequency radio data .",
    "results for a sample of powerful 3cr radio sources are also presented by the same author ( daly 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "a larger sample was compiled and studied in detail ; results from these studies have been presented in a series of papers ( wellman & daly 1996a , b ; wellman 1997 ; wellman , daly , & wan 1997a , b [ hereafter wdw97a , b ] ; wan & daly 1998a , b ; guerra & daly 1996 , 1998 ; guerra 1997 ; daly , guerra , & wan 1998 ; guerra , wan , & daly 1998 ; wan 1998 ; daly 2000 ) .",
    "for example , detailed results on the density and temperature of the ambient medium of the frii sources are presented by wdw97a , b , and the redshift evolution of the characteristic size of an frii source and its application for cosmology are presented by guerra & daly ( 1996 , 1998 ) , and guerra , daly , & wan ( 2000 ) .",
    "this paper presents results on several key parameters of the frii sources and their environments that were not presented and discussed in previous papers .",
    "these parameters include the luminosity in directed kinetic energy of the jet , also known as the beam power , @xmath4 , the total time the agn will produce the collimated outflow , @xmath5 , the thermal pressure of the ambient medium , @xmath6 , the effect of the hot gas on the microwave background radiation , and the total gravitational mass of the host cluster ( we find that the radio sources lie at the centers of gas rich clusters of galaxies ) .",
    "the way that these parameters can be estimated from radio data , and the empirical results for the sample , are presented here .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . a brief description of the sample and data for the sample are presented in  [ sec : sample ] .",
    "discussions on the jet luminosity and timescale of jet activity are given in ",
    "[ sec : lj ] , the thermal pressure of the ambient medium and estimates of the effect of the hot gas on the microwave background radiation are presented in  [ sec : pth ] , and estimating the total gravitational mass of the the host cluster of the radio source is discussed in ",
    "[ sec : mass ] .",
    "each of these sections are divided into two subsections , with the first subsection presenting theory and the second one presenting empirical results for the sample .",
    "further discussions of the results and a summary of the paper are presented in  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "values of hubble s constant @xmath7 and the de / acceleration parameter @xmath8=0 ( an open empty universe with zero cosmological constant ) are used to estimate all the parameters in this study .",
    "different choices of cosmological parameters , within reasonable limits , give results that are very similar to , and consistent with , those presented here .",
    "the sample used in this study has been described in detail in several previous papers ( wdw97a , b ; guerra & daly 1998 ) .",
    "the readers are referred to these papers for a full description of the sample ; a brief description of it follows .",
    "all the frii sources in this sample are very powerful 3cr sources , having 178 mhz radio power greater than @xmath9 ; such powerful frii sources are referred to as friib sources ( daly 2000 ) , or type 1 frii sources ( leahy & williams 1984 ) .",
    "they are drawn from the samples of leahy , muxlow , & stephens ( 1989 ; hereafter lms89 ) , which contains sources with large angular sizes , and liu , pooley , & riley ( 1992 ; hereafter lpr92 ) , which contains sources with smaller angular extent .",
    "the final sample contains 27 radio lobes from 14 friib radio galaxies , and 14 lobes from 8 friib radio loud quasars .",
    "these sources have redshifts ranging from zero to 2 , and projected core - hot spot separations between @xmath10 kpc and @xmath11 kpc .",
    "note that the questions of projection effects and radio power selection effects have been addressed in great detail by wan & daly ( 1998a , b ) .",
    "wdw97a , b used the radio maps from lms89 and lpr92 to estimate the width of the radio bridge behind the radio hot spot , @xmath12 , the non - thermal pressure of the radio lobe that drives the forward shock front , @xmath13 , and the rate at which the bridge is lengthening , referred to as the lobe propagation velocity @xmath14 .",
    "the radio information may also be used to estimate the beam power and total time the source will be active , as described in  3 .    in order to estimate the mach number of lobe advance , high quality radio maps which image large portions of the radio bridge",
    "are required ; the radio bridge is defined as the radio emitting region that lies between the radio hot spot and the origin of the host galaxy or quasar .",
    "there are 16 bridges in the sample for which we have a detection of the mach number of lobe advance , which includes 13 radio galaxy bridges and 3 radio loud quasar bridges .",
    "the mach number may be combined with the lobe propagation velocity @xmath14 to estimate the temperature of the ambient gas ( wdw97a ) .",
    "thus , the ambient gas temperature and pressure may be estimated for these sources .",
    "lower bounds on the mach number , and hence upper bounds on the ambient gas temperature and pressure , are available for the 14 other bridges , including 8 galaxy bridges and 6 quasar bridges , as described in wdw97a , b .",
    "the maps of the sources do not have sufficient dynamic range to allow detailed analyses of their bridge structure , and thus do not have estimates on the mach number of lobe advance , nor on the ambient gas pressure and cluster mass . as a result ,",
    "the sample of sources with estimates of the ambient gas pressure and cluster mass is rather small .",
    "results for radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies are analyzed separately when there are enough data points , as is the case in the study of the beam power . as noted above",
    ", the number of sources with thermal pressure and cluster mass estimates is rather small ( 16 lobes with detections and 14 with bounds ) .",
    "thus it is not practical to separate quasars and galaxies in the study of these parameters .",
    "cygnus  a ( 3c 405 ) is the only source with a redshift @xmath15 in our sample , and in some cases , results seem to depend on whether or not this source is included . thus , subsamples both with and without cygnus a are analyzed , and the results included here .",
    "note that cygnus a is not used to normalize any of the quantities studied here , with the exception of the total source lifetime .",
    "note , however , that an identical normalization of the total source lifetime is obtained when cygnus a is excluded from the analysis ( see the companion paper by guerra , daly , & wan 2000 ) .",
    "cygnus a is not needed to normalize any of the quantities studied here .",
    "the jet or beam of an frii radio source refers to the collimated outflow which carries energy from the agn . when the jet impinges upon the external medium , a strong shock is formed and the kinetic energy of the jet is deposited in the vicinity of the shock front , which is marked by the radio hot spot . in principle",
    ", one can calculate the beam power , @xmath16 , carried by the jet by studying the propagation of the hot spots .",
    "however , in practice it is difficult to use hot spot properties to estimate the beam power , since the hot spot is generally not resolved , and the position and properties of radio hot spots vary on short time scales ( laing 1989 ; carilli , perley , and dreher 1988 ; black et al . 1992 . ) .",
    "the model presented and discussed by ( daly 1994 , 1995 ) bypasses these difficulties by using properties of the more stable radio lobes to estimate the luminosity in directed kinetic energy , or the beam power , @xmath4 .",
    "this model is a natural progression following the work of blandford & rees ( 1974 ) , scheuer ( 1974 ) , eilek & shore ( 1989 ) , gopal - krishna & wiita ( 1991 ) , rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) , and many others .",
    "the method and results presented here are complementary to those of eilek & shore ( 1989 ) in the sense that eilek & shore ( 1989 ) considered the case of a non - supersonic expansion of the radio emitting region , while we consider the supersonic expansion of this region , and the shape of the radio emitting region considered here is different from that considered by eilek & shore .",
    "the results presented here are also complementary to those of gopal - krishna & wiita ( 1991 ) , who consider likely explanations for the decrease in frii radio source size with redshift , and who present a consistent picture in which the increase in radio luminosity and decrease in radio source size with redshift can be understood .",
    "the work presented here differs from that of gopal - krishna & wiita ( 1991 ) in that neither an efficiency nor an evolution of the ambient gas density with redshift are adopted .",
    "instead , we use the radio properties of a source to solve directly for the beam power of the source , as well as several other parameters , including the ambient gas density .",
    "the work presented here on the beam power is similar in spirit to that of rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) .",
    "the key difference is that here the radio bridge is assumed to be cylindrically symmetric , and thus has a volume that depends on the length of the bridge times the cross - sectional area of the bridge , while rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) seem to take a bridge volume that is proportional to the cube of the bridge length .",
    "observations and numerical simulations indicate that radio lobes of powerful extended radio sources propagate supersonically relative to the ambient medium ( alexander & leahy 1987 ; prestage & peacock 1988 ; cox , gull , & scheuer 1991 ; daly 1994 ; wdw97a , b ) .",
    "leahy ( 1990 ) shows that the properties of the radio lobe can be used to estimate the rate of energy input . in  3.4.4.3 ,",
    "leahy ( 1990 ) shows that the jet power may be written @xmath17 , since the energy density of a relativistic plasma is 3 times the pressure p ; note that the time rate of change of the volume may be written : @xmath18 since the forward region of the source grows with a velocity @xmath14 and has cross - sectional area @xmath19 .",
    "his equation may be rewritten as : l_j = 4a_l^2 v_l p_l .",
    "[ eq : lj1 ] here @xmath12 is the cross - sectional radius of the radio lobe , @xmath14 is the lobe propagation velocity , and the frii source is assumed to be cylindrically symmetric about the radio axis . using typical units ,",
    "@xmath4 can be expressed as l_j = 3.6 10 ^ 44 ^-1 ( a_l ) ^2 ( v_l c ) ( p_l 10 ^ -10 ^-2 ) , [ eq : lj2 ] all three parameters used to estimate @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lj2 ] ) can be estimated from radio data ( see , for example , daly 1995 , or wdw97a , b ) . the lobe radius @xmath12 can be measured from the radio map ( see wdw97a , b for detail ) .",
    "the lobe propagation velocity @xmath14 can be estimated using multi - frequency observations of radio lobes and bridges , by modeling the spectral aging of relativistic electrons due to synchrotron and inverse compton losses ( wdw97a , b ; wan & daly 1998a , b ; myers & spangler 1985 ; alexander & leahy 1987 ; lms89 ; lpr92 ; carilli 1991 ; perley & taylor 1991 ) . the lobe pressure @xmath13 is given by p_l = ( b^-1.5 + b^2 ) b_min^2 24 , [ eq : pl ] where @xmath20 is the magnetic field strength in the radio lobe under the minimum - energy condition ( miley 1980 ; pacholczyk 1970 ) , @xmath21 is the ratio of the true magnetic field strength @xmath22 to the minimum - energy magnetic field strength : @xmath23 , and the equation is in cgs units . wdw97b",
    "estimate @xmath21 to be about 0.25 , with a source - to - source dispersion less than about @xmath24 .",
    "this value of @xmath21 is consistent with values obtained by other authors ( carilli 1991 ; perley & taylor 1991 ; feigelson 1995 ) , and is used throughout this study .    the radio spectral index of an frii source is used in the spectral aging analysis to estimate the lobe propagation velocity @xmath14 .",
    "it is shown in wdw97b that there is a clear correlation between the radio spectral indices of the sources in this sample and redshift .",
    "the spectral index @xmath25 can be expressed as @xmath26 .",
    "the best fitted value of @xmath27 is @xmath28 with a reduced @xmath29 of 1.7 .",
    "such a correlation could be caused by intrinsic curvature in the initial electron energy spectrum or effects of inverse compton cooling on the hot spot spectral index ( see wdw97b ) .",
    "thus , the observed spectral index may not be the appropriate index to used in spectral aging analysis .",
    "this lead wdw97b to also consider correcting the observed spectral indices to zero redshift using the empirical correlation between @xmath25 and @xmath30 for the sample .",
    "results obtained with and without this correction are included here .",
    "the beam power @xmath4 can be used to estimate the total time that the agn will be active , and will produce highly collimated outflows . following daly ( 1994 , 1995 ) and guerra & daly ( 1996 , 1998 ) , the total lifetime of an outflow , defined as @xmath31 ,",
    "is related to the energy extraction rate @xmath4 by a power law : t _ = c l_j^-_/3 , [ eq : tstar ] where @xmath32 is a parameter that has implications for models of energy extraction from the central engine . as described in detail in a companion paper",
    "( see guerra , daly , & wan 2000 ) , eq .",
    "( 4 ) is equivalent to assuming that the source will have an average size close to the average size of the full population located at a similar redshift , and that the average rate of growth of the source will be close to the current rate of growth of the source .",
    "thus , we could have written @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the average size of the full population of friib sources at similar redshift , and @xmath14 is the rate of growth of the source under consideration .",
    "since this is precisely the manner in which the value of @xmath35 is obtained , it is an equivalent approach .",
    "note that the value of @xmath35 is , fortuitously , independent of choice of cosmological parameters , and it is independent of the way the relation is normalized ( see the companion paper of guerra , daly , & wan 2000 ) .",
    "the current best estimate of @xmath32 is @xmath36 ( see the compansion paper of guerra , daly , & wan 2000 ) .",
    "( note that the @xmath32 used here is not related to @xmath37 used in ",
    "[ sec : pth ] and  [ sec : mass ] for the king density profile . )",
    "the characteristic size of an frii source is related to its lifetime as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the normalization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tstar ] ) .",
    "this normalization factor is chosen so that at @xmath40 , the characteristic size of cygnus a matches the observed average lobe - lobe size for sources at this redshift .",
    "that is , @xmath41 for one side of cygnus a is added to @xmath41 on the other side of cygnus  a , and this is set equal to @xmath42 = @xmath43 kpc .",
    "this equation is then solved for the normalization factor @xmath39 ; the uncertainty on @xmath39 is indicated in table 1 .",
    "this normalization is then used in equation ( [ eq : tstar ] ) to obtain an estimate of the total time that the agn will be producing large - scale jets .",
    "note that a nearly identical normalization is obtained when cygnus a is excluded from the data analysis , as shown in a compansion paper ( guerra , daly , & wan 2000 ) .",
    "note also that the constraints on @xmath44 and on cosmological parameters are independent of this normalization , as described in guerra , daly , & wan ( 2000 ) .",
    "the value for @xmath5 estimated using independent information from each side of the source should of course be equal , and are generally very close in value . the value adopted for the beam power , @xmath4 , of cygnus",
    "a used above is listed in table 1 , @xmath14 for cygnus a is obtained from table 1 from wdw97b , and a value of @xmath45 = @xmath46 kpc is adopted from table 3 of guerra , daly , & wan ( 2000 ) .    the results on @xmath5 do not depend on the normalization adopted here ; as shown in a companion paper , nearly identical results obtain when cygnus a is excluded from the analysis . and ,",
    "cygnus a is not used to normalize any other quantity .",
    "thus , none of the results presented in this paper rely upon a normalization based on cygnus a.      the beam power , @xmath4 , has been estimated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : lj2 ] ) for the lobe propagation velocity estimated using the observed radio spectral index , and the redshift - corrected radio spectral index ; both are listed in table 1 .",
    "typical values of @xmath4 are @xmath47 .",
    "no strong correlation is found between the beam power @xmath4 and the linear size of the source , represented by the core - hot spot separation @xmath48 .",
    "figure  1 is a log - log plot of @xmath4 vs. @xmath48 , where the observed radio spectral index @xmath25 is used .",
    "the figure of @xmath4 vs. @xmath48 after applying the redshift - correction on @xmath25 is almost identical to figure  1 , and is thus not shown here .    for radio - loud quasars , the best - fitted line in fig .",
    "1 has a slope of about zero .",
    "a spearman rank correlation analysis shows that the correlation coefficient between @xmath4 and @xmath48 is @xmath49 when no redshift - correction on the spectral index is applied , and @xmath50 when the spectral index correction is applied . here",
    "the number in parentheses is the significance of the correlation .",
    "these results suggest that the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath48 for radio - loud quasars is insignificant , either with or without the @xmath51 correction .",
    "that is , @xmath4 is independent of @xmath48 for the radio - loud quasars .    for radio galaxies , @xmath4 appears to increase slightly with @xmath48 in fig .  1 , and results from the spearman rank correlation analysis hint a marginally significant correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath48 .",
    "the correlation coefficient is about 0.3 , with a significance level of about @xmath52 , which holds with or without the @xmath51 correction .",
    "however , note that the best - fitted line for radio galaxies in fig .",
    "1 has a slope only @xmath53 away from zero , and that a correlation coefficient of about 0.3 is rather weak .",
    "thus it appears that @xmath4 is at most weakly dependent on @xmath48 for radio galaxies .",
    "these results for radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies are consistent with the assumption that @xmath4 is roughly constant over a source s lifetime .",
    "the relationship between @xmath4 and redshift and radio power ( @xmath54 ) has been studied in detail in wan & daly ( 1998a ) .",
    "increases of @xmath4 with @xmath55 and with @xmath54 are observed ( see figures  2 and 3 )",
    ". however , the radio power of the sources in the sample also increases with redshift since the sources used in this study all come from the flux - limited 3cr survey . as a result , which of the @xmath56 and @xmath57 correlations is more significant , and the role of radio power selection effects , needs to be considered carefully .",
    "wan & daly ( 1998a ) used two parameter fitting and partial rank analysis to investigate this .",
    "the two parameter fit yields the following @xmath58 values : @xmath59 for all galaxies , @xmath60 for all galaxies except for cygnus a , and @xmath61 for all radio - loud quasars .",
    "the number in parenthesis is the uncertainty on @xmath58 times @xmath62 , which includes the effect of a reduced @xmath29 @xmath63 that is greater than one for the fit .",
    "this notation will be used throughout this paper .",
    "the values of @xmath58 are more that @xmath53 away from zero , for both radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars .",
    "this means that the @xmath56 correlation is unlikely to be caused purely by radio power selection effects .",
    "that is , a real increase of @xmath4 with redshift exists , though the magnitude of this redshift evolution is not well determined .",
    "the @xmath57 correlation , on the other hand , is rather poorly constrained .",
    "results from the one parameter fit suggest @xmath4 goes roughly proportional to @xmath64 ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the two parameter fit , which takes into account the redshift dependence of radio power , gives values of @xmath65 with large uncertainties : @xmath66 for all galaxies , @xmath67 for all galaxies except for cygnus a , and @xmath68 for all radio - loud quasars .",
    "thus , the exact relationship between @xmath4 and radio power is not clear at the present time .",
    "note , however , large amounts of scatter are seen in the @xmath4 vs. @xmath64 plot ( see figure 3 ) , which is also reflected in the large reduced @xmath29 of the one parameter fit .",
    "for the same beam power , the radio power can vary by about a factor of ten .",
    "this suggests that radio power is not an accurate measure of the beam power , and that the apparent correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath54 may result from the fact that both increase with redshift .",
    "the properties of friib radio sources suggest that the total lifetime of a source decreases systematically with redshift .",
    "this follows because the average size of friib sources decreases with redshift , while the rate of growth of the sources increases with redshift .",
    "another way to state this is : as @xmath4 increases with redshift , the total lifetime of an outflow , @xmath31 , estimated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tstar ] ) , decreases with redshift .",
    "the values of the full lifetime of the source @xmath31 are listed in table 1 .",
    "typical values of @xmath31 range from about @xmath69 to @xmath2 years .",
    "figure  4 plots @xmath31 as a function of redshift .",
    "it is clear that @xmath31 decreases with @xmath55 , which can explain the fact that the average size of powerful extended 3cr sources decreases with redshift for @xmath70 ( see guerra & daly 1998 ) , while the lobe propagation velocity @xmath14 increases with redshift .",
    "clearly if @xmath14 increases with redshift , and the mean source size @xmath71 decreases with redshift , then @xmath5 must decrease with redshift since @xmath72 .",
    "the sources at high redshift produces more powerful jets ( with larger @xmath4 ) for a shorter period of time ( with smaller @xmath5 ) , which results in smaller average sizes than low - redshift sources .",
    "the studies of wdw97a and b show that both the ambient gas density and temperature of an friib source can be estimated from radio data .",
    "the thermal pressure of the ambient gas @xmath6 is obviously proportional to the product of the density @xmath73 and the temperature @xmath74 . interestingly , as shown below , although the lobe propagation velocity enters into @xmath73 and @xmath74 , it cancels out in the product , so the thermal pressure of the ambient gas can be estimated using single frequency radio data if the radio emission from the bridge is mapped over a large enough region of the bridge .",
    "this offers a completely new method to estimate the thermal pressure of the ambient gas surrounding high - redshift radio sources using only single frequency radio data",
    ".    it can be complicated and time consuming to estimate the ambient gas density in the vicinity of classical double radio sources using x - ray observations , especially for sources at high redshift .",
    "an attractive alternative method of estimating @xmath73 in the vicinity of a radio source is to use the radio data . given that the radio lobe represents a strong shock front , the lobe pressure @xmath13 , the ambient gas density @xmath75 , and the lobe propagation velocity are related :",
    "the strong shock jump conditions imply that @xmath76 holds , where @xmath13 is the non - thermal pressure inside the radio lobe , and @xmath75 is the mass density of the ambient gas .",
    "the electron number density of the ambient gas @xmath73 can be estimated using n_a , [ eq : na ] where @xmath77 is the mean molecular weight of the gas in amu , with a value of 0.63 when solar abundances are assumed , and @xmath78 is the proton mass .    the ambient gas temperature can be estimated by careful studies of the radio bridge , as discussed in detail in wdw97a .",
    "a brief description of the theory is as follows .",
    "when the non - thermal pressure of the radio bridge is much greater than the ambient gas pressure , the bridge undergoes supersonic expansion .",
    "this lateral expansion can be treated as a blast wave and the expansion velocity is determined by ram pressure confinement .",
    "this causes the width of the bridge , @xmath79 , to vary with time approximately as @xmath80 ( begelman & cioffi 1989 ; daly 1990 ; wdw97a ) .",
    "since the lobe propagation velocity @xmath14 is roughly constant during a given source s lifetime ( lpr92 ; wdw97a , b ) , the lobe front will advance a distance of @xmath81 during @xmath82 as the bridge expands .",
    "this means that at a distance @xmath83 from the hot spot , the bridge expansion time is @xmath84 .",
    "thus the shape of the radio bridge roughly follows a square root law , with the bridge width @xmath85 .",
    "this behavior was in fact found by wdw97a .",
    "as the bridge expands , the pressure inside decreases until it becomes comparable to the ambient gas pressure .",
    "when this occurs , the lateral expansion velocity becomes sonic , causing a break in the functional form of @xmath86 .",
    "the width of the bridge starts to deviate from the square root law and becomes roughly constant as equilibrium is being reached . at the point where such a break occurs",
    ", the lateral expansion velocity is approximately sonic .",
    "thus the sound speed of the ambient gas ( @xmath87 ) can be estimated using c_s .",
    "b = .da dt_b = .da dx_b dxdt = .da dx_b v_l , [ eq : cs ] where @xmath88 denotes the lateral expansion velocity at the break .",
    "the mach number of lobe propagation is defined as @xmath89 .",
    "given the expression for @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs ] ) , the mach number of lobe propagation is : m ( .da dx_b ) ^-1 = 2 x_b a_b , [ eq : mach ] where @xmath90 is the width of the bridge at the break , and @xmath91 is the position of the break relative to the hot spot ( see wdw97a ) .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mach ] ) that @xmath92 depends only on the geometrical shape of the radio bridge .",
    "the ambient gas temperature t can be expressed as : t = m_pk c_s^2 ( .da d x _ b ) ^2 v_l^2 v_l^2 m^-2 , [ eq : t ] where @xmath93 is the ratio of specific heats of the ambient gas .",
    "multi - frequency radio maps are required in order to use eqs .",

    "the values of gas fraction shown in the figure are consistent with observed values for inner regions of many clusters ( donahue 1996 ) , whereas those for models without a redshift - correction on the radio spectral index , and without a core radius evolution seem to be low compared with observed values .",
    "several factors may contribute to the slow decrease of gas fraction with redshift that is seen in figure  13 .",
    "first , the increase of cluster core radius with redshift means that the gas fraction estimated for the high - redshift clusters is over a larger fraction of the cluster core than for the low - redshift clusters .",
    "the gas fraction estimated at high redshift mainly represents the gas fraction inside the cluster core , and it is known that gas fraction increases with increasing radius in clusters ( david , jones , & forman 1995 ) .",
    "second , the mass contribution from galaxies is higher at the cluster center than at large radii ( loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) .",
    "thus by sampling a larger fraction of the cluster core at higher redshift , a larger fraction of the total baryon mass is not taken into account at higher redshift .",
    "further , the decrease in gas fraction with redshift could be due to the stripping of gas from galaxies in the cluster core over time .",
    "finally , the cluster gas becomes more concentrated toward the cluster center as it cools , which also causes the gas fraction in the cluster center to increase with time .",
    "these results on cluster mass and gas fraction obtained above are still preliminary due to the small size of the sample .",
    "more sources with estimates on the ambient gas temperature , and hence cluster mass , will help to test these results .",
    "several key parameters of an frii source and its gaseous environment are studied in this paper .",
    "direct estimates of the beam power , which measures the energy extraction rate from the agn by the jet , are obtained .",
    "typical beam powers of about @xmath158 are found for the sources in the sample .",
    "no strong correlation is seen between the beam power and the linear size of the source , which is consistent with the beam power being roughly constant throughout the lifetime of a source .",
    "there is a trend for the beam power to increase with redshift , which is significant even after excluding radio power selection effects .",
    "the magnitude of this redshift evolution , however , is not well determined by the current data . it is well known that the quasar luminosity function undergoes strong evolution between @xmath159 and @xmath160 , with the high - redshift quasars being more luminous than their low - redshift counterparts ( schmidt & green 1983 ; yee & ellingson 1993 ; la franca & cristiani 1997 ) .",
    "this suggests that high - redshift agns are more powerful than low redshift ones .",
    "thus it is perhaps not surprising to find that the beam power , or energy per unit time channeled into the jet by the agn , is also higher at high redshift .",
    "the relationship between the beam power and the radio power is not well constrained after their correlations with redshift are taken into account .",
    "the two parameter fit of yields values of @xmath65 with large uncertainties .",
    "thus it is not clear at present how the beam power and the radio power are related .",
    "however , the large amount of scatter seen in the beam power - radio power relation suggests that radio power is not an accurate measure of beam power .",
    "the beam power @xmath4 can be used to estimate the total lifetime of an outflow produced by an agn . following daly ( 1994 ) and guerra & daly ( 1996 , 1998 ) , the total time for which the outflow will occur , @xmath31 ,",
    "is related to @xmath4 : @xmath161 , where @xmath32 is estimated to be about @xmath162 ( guerra , daly , & wan 2000 ) .",
    "typical lifetimes of about @xmath69 to @xmath2 years are obtained for the sources studied here .",
    "this would is almost precisely the same lifetime as would be obtained by dividing the average size of all friib sources at similar redshift by the rate of growth of the source under consideration .",
    "the lifetime of the outflow decreases with redshift , which explains the decrease of the average size of powerful extended 3cr sources with redshift .",
    "the sources at high redshift produces more powerful jets for a shorter period of time , which results in smaller average sizes than low - redshift sources .    a new method of estimating the thermal pressure of the ambient gas in the vicinity of powerful classical double radio source using only single frequency radio data is presented .",
    "the pressure is given by the product of the ambient gas density , estimated using ram pressure confinement of the radio lobe , and the ambient gas temperature , estimated using the mach number for the source and the lobe advance speed .",
    "* it turns out that the lobe propagation velocity cancels out of the product @xmath163 , and the ambient gas pressure can be estimated by studying the shape of the radio bridge , and the non - thermal pressure of the radio lobe ( see  [ sec : pth ] ) . *",
    "thus , the thermal pressure , the product of the ambient gas density and temperature , depends only on the non - thermal pressure in the radio lobe and the geometrically determined mach number of lobe advance , both of which can be estimated using single frequency radio data .",

    "the current data are consistent with a core radius evolution from at @xmath165 to at @xmath166 , which agrees with results obtained from studies of the ambient gas density ( wdw97b ) .",
    "wdw97b find that the data can be described by a model where the core gas density decreases and the core radius increases so that the core gas mass remains roughly constant .    the thermal pressures obtained here can be used to estimate the amount of cmb diminution expected from the clusters surrounding the frii sources in the sample .",
    "contaminations from the radio sources can be reduced by observing at high frequency , such as 140 ghz , since emission from the radio sources decreases rapidly with increasing frequency .",

    "note , however , that with the study presented here , we only study the central regions of clusters .    the values of gas mass fraction obtained for the clusters surrounding the frii sources studied here are consistent with observed values for central regions of clusters , after the correlation between the radio spectral index and redshift is taken into account , and a redshift evolution of the cluster core radius is considered .",

    "the gas mass fraction seems to decrease slowly with redshift .",
    "the increase of cluster core radius with redshift can be one cause .",
    "another possible explanation is that a large fraction of the gas is still in the galaxies at high redshift , and is later stripped from the galaxies into the cluster at low redshift .",

    "<S> multi - frequency radio observations of the radio bridge of a powerful classical double radio source can be used to determine : the beam power of the jets emanating from the agn ; the total time the source will actively produce jets that power large - scale radio emission ; the thermal pressure of the medium in the vicinity of the radio source ; and the total mass , including dark matter , of the galaxy or cluster of galaxies traced by the ambient gas that surrounds the radio source . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical constructs that allow a determination of each of these quantities using radio observations are presented and discussed . </S>",
    "<S> empirical determinations of each of these quantities are obtained and analyzed for 22 radio sources ; cygnus a is one of the sources in the sample , but it is not used , or needed , to normalize any of these quantities .    a sample of 14 radio galaxies and 8 radio loud quasars with redshifts between zero and two was studied in detail ; each source has enough radio information to be able to determine each of the physical parameters listed above . </S>",
    "<S> the beam power was determined for each beam of each agn ( so there are two numbers for each source ) ; these agn are highly symmetric in terms of beam powers . </S>",
    "<S> typical beam powers are about @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> . no strong correlation is seen between the beam power and the core - hot spot separation , which suggests that the beam power is roughly constant over the lifetime of a source . </S>",
    "<S> the beam power increases with redshift , which is significant after excluding correlations between the radio power and redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between beam power and radio power is not well constrained by the current data .    </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic or total time the agn will actively produce a collimated outflow is estimated . </S>",
    "<S> typical total lifetimes are @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) years . </S>",
    "<S> total source lifetimes decrease with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> this decrease in total lifetime with increasing redshift can explain the decrease in the average source size ( hot spot - hot spot separation ) with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> thus , high - redshift sources are smaller because they have shorter lifetimes ; note that higher redshift sources grow more rapidly than low redshift sources .    </S>",
    "<S> a new method of estimating the thermal pressure of the ambient gas in the vicinity of a powerful classical double radio source is presented . </S>",
    "<S> this new estimate is independent of synchrotron and inverse compton aging arguments , and depends only upon the properties of the radio lobe and the shape of the radio bridge . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed radio map of the radio bridge at a single radio frequency can be used to estimate the thermal pressure of the ambient gas . </S>",
    "<S> thermal pressures on the order of @xmath3 , typical of gas in low - redshift clusters of galaxies , are found for the environments of the sources studied here . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that appreciable amounts of cosmic microwave background diminution ( the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ) are expected from many of these clusters </S>",
    "<S> . this could be detected at high frequency where the emission from the radio sources is weak .    </S>",
    "<S> the total gravitational mass of the host cluster of galaxies is estimated using the composite pressure profile and the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for cluster gas . </S>",
    "<S> total masses , and mass - density profiles , similar to those of low - redshift clusters of galaxies are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> thus , some clusters of galaxies , or cores of clusters , exist at redshifts of one to two . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift evolution of the cluster mass is not well determined at present . </S>",
    "<S> the current data do not indicate any negative evolution of the cluster mass , which may have implications for models of evolution of structure in the universe . </S>"
