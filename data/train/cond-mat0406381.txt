    "<S> the fluorescence emission of single colloidal ncs , e.g. cdse quantum dots , exhibits interesting intermittency behavior @xcite . a standard method to analyze such intensity signals is to define a threshold @xmath0 and define two states : _ on _ if @xmath1 and _ off _ otherwise . for capped ncs ( e.g. cdse(zns ) core - shell nc ) _ on _ and _ off _ times exhibit power law statistics @xcite , their probability density function ( pdf ) behave like @xmath2 for large @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> for example in @xcite @xmath5 ncs were measured and the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath7 were found ( note that within error of measurement @xmath8 ) , further all ncs are reported to be statistically identical . since @xmath4 the average _ on _ and _ off _ times are infinite . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence of occupation times naturally leads to non - ergodicity in the blinking ncs @xcite ( see also @xcite for related discussion ) . </S>",
    "<S> other measurements classify the intermittency based on time average correlation function or closely related power spectrum @xcite . in this type of analysis of the experimental data </S>",
    "<S> there is no need to introduce a threshold value @xmath0 .    from a single realization of intensity trajectory @xmath9 , recorded in a time interval @xmath10 </S>",

    "<S> we quantify the non - ergodic properties of the correlation functions of blinking ncs , using a stochastic approach . a related question of non - stastionarity , or more specifically aging of the ensemble average correlation function , is a subject of intensive research in the literature @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> a schematic realization of the intensity fluctuations is shown in fig . [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the process is characterized based on the sequence @xmath18 of _ on _ and _ off _ sojourn times or equivalently according to the dots on the time axis @xmath19 , on which transitions from _ on _ to _ off _ or vice versa occur ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> note that similar intermittency behavior describes a wide range of physical systems and models . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the model describes a lvy walk , which is an important stochastic model for anomalous diffusion describing dynamics of systems mentioned in the abstract @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the power law behavior of the sojourn times of the ncs can be explained based on simple physical models . </S>",
    "<S> for example random energy trapping models and random walks models @xcite can be used to model such behavior , though currently it is not clear yet what is the physical mechanism behind the observed power law behavior @xcite .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , ten typical simulated correlation functions are plotted , the most striking feature of the figure is that the correlation functions are random . </S>",
    "<S> these correlation functions are similar to those obtained in the experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , the question of non - ergodicity may be formulated in the following way . since the process @xmath9 is random the time average correlation function @xmath25 is random . </S>",
    "<S> for ergodic processes , and in the long measurement time limit , the distribution of @xmath25 is delta peaked and centered around the ensemble average correlation function . for non - ergodic processes the goal is to obtain the non - trivial limiting distributions of @xmath25 which differ from the narrowly peaked delta functions found for ergodic processes . in what follows we will denote @xmath26 to be the pdf of @xmath25 .    to start our analysis we rewrite the time average correlation function as @xmath27 where we used the initial condition that @xmath14 at time @xmath16 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq03],[eq04 ] ) we find an exact expression for the correlation functions in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath38@xmath39 the first term on the right hand side of this equation is @xmath40 the total time spent in state _ on _ in the time interval @xmath31 $ ] , in the remaining two terms we have considered sojourn times @xmath20 larger or smaller than @xmath35 separately .    </S>",
    "<S> we now illustrate the rich behaviors of the pdf @xmath26 using numerical simulations , and later we consider the problem analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we generate random realization of the process using @xmath41 for @xmath42 and show two cases : @xmath43 in fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] that the pdf @xmath47 has a @xmath48 shape . </S>",
    "<S> this is a strong non - ergodic behavior , since the pdf does not peak on the ensemble averaged value of the correlation function which is @xmath49 for this case . on the other hand , when @xmath44 the pdf @xmath47 has a @xmath50 shape , a weak non ergodic behavior . to understand the origin of this type of transition note that as @xmath51 we expect the process to be in an _ on _ state or an _ off _ state for the whole duration of the measurement , hence in that case the pdf of the correlation function will peak on @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( i.e @xmath48 shape behavior ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand when @xmath54 we expect a more ergodic behavior , since for @xmath55 the mean _ on _ and _ off _ periods are finite , this manifests itself in a peak of the distribution function of @xmath25 on the ensemble average value of @xmath49 and a @xmath50 shape pdf emerges . </S>",
