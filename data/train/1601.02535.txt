    "to qualitatively explain this , we note that in weak fields the dressed - state coefficients and dipole moments have fixed amplitudes and phases relative to the field ( in the field picture and using the rotating wave approximation ) . in strong fields ,",
    "wave function coefficients and dipole moments vary significantly throughout the microwave - field cycle .",
    "specifically , the floquet modes are time - periodic wave - packets that are synchronized with the driving rf field . to visualize typical floquet wave - packet dynamics , see the videos of the wave - packet evolution of the wave functions shown in fig .",

    "additional features evident in the experimental map are due to e - field inhomogeneities , which are discussed in detail below .",

    "the dominant down - shifting line suddenly terminates at close to @xmath81  mhz .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] that the sudden termination of the down - shifting lines is due to a wide floquet avoided crossing . avoided crossings in floquet maps , such as those in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , provide convenient markers for spectroscopic determination of the rf e - field on an absolute scale . in the present case ,",
    "the prominent avoided crossing at 165  v / m ( see label 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) has several matching locations in the experimental spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) .",
    "these are seen more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) , which shows the experimental data on a dbm scale .",
    "the appearance of multiple copies of the calculated avoided crossing in the experiment points to the fact that the microwave field within the cell must have multiple dominant domains , each of which produces its own rendering of the avoided crossing .",
    "the rendering at the lowest injected microwave power corresponds to the e - field domain with the highest field at a given injected power ( calculation and e - field axis shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ) . in figure",
    "[ fig:2](b ) the avoided crossing is observed first at 130  mw , at which point the domain that has the highest field reaches 165  v / m .",
    "it follows that at a microwave power of 250  mw a maximum rf e - field of @xmath82  v / m is reached .",
    "the uncertainty is given by half the experimental step size ( @xmath830.5  db , corresponding to @xmath84 in field ) .    the experimental spectrum plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) and  [ fig:5](a ) contains information on the continuous distribution of the microwave e - field strength along the length of the eit probe and coupling beams passing through the spectroscopic cell .",
    "the microwave boundary conditions are symmetric about the @xmath85-plane , with the incident microwave e - field being @xmath11-polarized and the optical beams propagating along the @xmath86 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ) . since the microwave field is primarily @xmath11-polarized along the optical beams , it drives @xmath87 rydberg transitions within the @xmath88 and @xmath89 manifolds of states .",
    "the field distribution is a result of superpositions of reflections from the cell walls .",
    "also , the cell is placed within the near field of the source , leading to additional variability of the microwave field along the probe beam .",
    "hence , one may picture the rf field as a speckle pattern , akin to speckle patters seen for general , non - ideal coherent fields .",
    "here , one should expect the number of speckles to be on the order of the cell length divided by the wavelength , which in our case is on the order of three .",
    "also , since there are no structures within the cell that are very close to the optical probe beam path , we do not expect any sharp spatial features in the microwave e - field ( features which might otherwise arise from sharp metallic or dielectric edges and the like ) .",
    "therefore , for each theoretical line in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] the measured eit spectra are expected to exhibit a small number of spectral features that correspond to the local maxima and minima of the microwave field along the length of the probe beam .",
    "based on the observation of five downward spectral lines [ labeled in fig .",

    "<S> we present a spectral analysis of rydberg atoms in strong microwave fields using electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) as an all - optical readout . </S>",

    "<S> microwaves are irradiated into a room - temperature rubidium vapor cell . </S>",
    "<S> the microwaves are tuned near the two - photon @xmath0 rydberg transition and reach an electric field strength of 230  v / m , about 20% of the microwave ionization threshold of these atoms . </S>",
    "<S> a floquet treatment is used to model the rydberg level energies and their excitation rates . </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at an empirical model for the field - strength distribution inside the spectroscopic cell that yields excellent overall agreement between the measured and calculated rydberg eit - floquet spectra . using spectral features in the floquet maps we achieve an absolute strong - field measurement precision of @xmath1 . </S>"
