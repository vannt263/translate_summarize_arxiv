    "<S> i suppose a detector in minkowski vacuum , constrained to a trocheries - takeno type motion . it should be stressed that by following the procedure outlined in this letter , inside the light cylinder of @xcite , results in a transition rate similar to equation ( [ eq3 ] ) below .    it is assumed a monopole type coupling of the detector and field , @xmath0 where @xmath1 has energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> we require both the detector and the field to obey schrdinger s unitary time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that in the very early past the detector is in the ground state with energy @xmath2 , @xmath3 and that the field is in the ( minkowski ) vacuum state @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> as the detector moves , field and detector will undergo transitions to various states , in a trajectory dependent fashion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since one does not care about the field s final state , the unknown final state of the field should be traced out from the transition probability for thetransitions in question . </S>",
    "<S> this process yields , in first order perturbation theory the following expression for the transition rate @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy difference between the initial and final states of the detector and @xmath7 is the positive frequency wightman function .    </S>",

    "<S> , the @xmath17 factor is associated to the adiabatic switching of the detector and the usual @xmath18 prescription is related to its size . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath16 , and the integral is over the real axis , the integrand in ( [ eq2 ] ) can be written as @xmath19}{(x - i\\epsilon)^2 } \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{v\\sin(x - i\\epsilon)}{x - i\\epsilon}\\right)^{2n}.\\ ] ]    after a binomial expansion , this last integral is evaluated using ordinary residue calculus @xmath20^{2n+2k-1 } \\theta ( -e + k\\omega\\gamma ) } { ( -1)^{n-1}(2n+2k-1)(n-1)!(n+2k-1 ) ! } , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the heaviside step function , which indicates that the rotational motion is the thermal reservoir . </S>",

    "<S> this distribution function is understood as the mean number of particles per volume , with energy @xmath24 perceived by the detector . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , density will be assumed to be per unit volume .    in this spirit , the total energy density of the scalar particles is given by the following integral , which can be written in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath26^{2n+2k-1 } } { ( -1)^{n-1}(2n+2k-1)(n-1)!(n+2k-1)!}\\nonumber\\\\ & & e_t=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2 \\pi v } \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\int_0^k dx \\frac{\\left[v\\left(-x + k\\right)\\right]^{2n+2k-1 } } { ( -1)^{n-1}(2n+2k-1)(n-1)!(n+2k-1)!}\\nonumber\\\\ & & e_t=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi r^2}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(vk ) ^{2(n+k)}}{(-1)^{n-1}(2n+2k)(2n+2k-1)(n-1)!(n+2k-1)!}\\label{limite}\\\\ & & e_t=\\frac{1}{2\\pi r^2}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{(\\tanh(\\omega r)k)^{2k+2 } { } _ { 2}f_3(k+1/2,k+1;k+3/2,k+2,2k+1;-\\tanh(\\omega r)^2k^2)}{(k+1/2)(k+1)(2k)!}\\label{energia},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 plays a role similar to the temperature , and there is an explicit dependence on the coordinate @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a non constant temperature distribution . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the above expression ( [ energia ] ) , at the origin when @xmath29 , the energy density is @xmath30 , which makes sense , because the motion of detector when @xmath29 is inertial .    </S>",
    "<S> next , the convergence of the infinite summation ( [ limite ] ) , is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the second derivative with respect to @xmath31 of ( [ limite ] ) is of the type @xmath32 the last expression is valid asymptotically when @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite . in this asymptotic spirit , the summation ( [ converg ] ) can be replaced by the integral over @xmath35 , from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , which results in @xmath38 the original summation ( [ limite ] ) is obtained by integrating the last equation two times in @xmath31 @xmath39 which is plotted numerically in the following +   +        the above graphic indicates , in a indirect way , that the summation given in ( [ limite ] ) and ( [ energia ] ) converges , except when @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this divergence of the total energy density of the scalar particles perceived by the detector , is expected when the detector is moving ( almost ) with the velocity of light , @xmath40 .    by summing the first few terms in ( [ energia ] ) , the following total energy density of scalar particles is obtained at a given @xmath28 , for @xmath41 and @xmath42 +        showing that for a same distance @xmath28 from the origin , there is an increase in the energy for larger values of @xmath27 .    it should be stressed that in spite that ( [ energia ] ) describes a non constant temperature distribution , it is an equilibrium configuration . this interesting equilibrium concept is well known and is expected if the space being considered is not homogeneous and isotropic as in trocheries - takeno case , see for example @xcite . the external condition that originates </S>",
    "<S> this motion is responsible for this apparent non equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the above construction avoids canonical quantization , and it could be usefull to a further understanding of external conditions . </S>"
