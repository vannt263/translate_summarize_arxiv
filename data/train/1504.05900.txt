    "the diamond channel introduced by schein @xcite consists of a broadcast channel ( bc ) from a source to two relays and a multiple access channel ( mac ) from the two relays to a destination .",
    "the capacity of the diamond channel is not known in general . to simplify the problem ,",
    "let us consider a diamond channel having bc with two orthogonal links and gaussian mac . in this setup , there is a tension between increasing the amount of information sent over the bc and increasing the coherent combining gain for the mac .",
    "two coding schemes corresponding to the extremes would be partial decode - and - forward , where independent partial messages are sent to the relays , and decode - and - forward ( df ) , where the whole message is sent to each of the relays . by incorporating multicoding at the source , @xcite , @xcite proposed a coding scheme in which the relays send independent partial messages using dependent codewords and showed that this coding scheme strictly outperforms the df and partial df in some regime .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed an upper bound by taking into account the correlation between the two relay signals , which is strictly tighter than the cutset bound .",
    "this upper bound was shown to coincide with the lower bound of @xcite , @xcite for some channel parameters .    in this paper , we consider the degraded gaussian diamond - wiretap channel presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : physical ] and present lower and upper bounds on the secrecy capacity by exploiting the correlation between the two relay signals .",
    "we identify several ranges of channel parameters where these bounds coincide with useful intuitions and investigate the effect of the presence of an eavesdropper on the capacity .",
    "we note that this model is a natural first step to studying diamond - wiretap channel because the sum secrecy capacity of the multiple access - wiretap channel has been characterized only for the degraded gaussian case @xcite .",
    "a practical situation corresponding to this model is the side channel attack @xcite where the eavesdropper attacks by probing the physical signals such as timing information and power consumption leaked from the legitimate destination . in the presence of an eavesdropper , the technique of utilizing randomness is widely used to confuse the eavesdropper .",
    "we consider the following two scenarios regarding the availability of randomness : 1 ) a common randomness of rate @xmath0 is available at the source and the two relays and 2 ) a randomness of rate @xmath0 is available only at the source and there is no available randomness at the relays .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite for the related works assuming restricted randomness at encoders .    for the upper bound",
    ", we generalize the upper bound on the capacity of the diamond channel @xcite and the upper bound on the sum secrecy capacity of the multiple access - wiretap channel @xcite . for the lower bound",
    ", we propose two types of coding schemes : 1 ) a decode - and - forward ( df ) scheme where the relays cooperatively transmit the message and the fictitious message and 2 ) a partial df scheme incorporated with multicoding in which each relay sends an independent partial message and the whole or partial fictitious message using dependent codewords .",
    "if there is no secrecy constraint , our partial df scheme incorporated with multicoding falls back to that in @xcite , @xcite .",
