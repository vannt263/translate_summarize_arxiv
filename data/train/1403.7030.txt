    "nanostructured periodic systems that exhibit a gap in their linear spectrum give rise to a number of unique light - matter interaction processes @xcite .",

    "however , similar behavior is expected to be found for other excited systems as well that are coupled to a continuum of states with the band gaps .    here ,",
    "the sine - gordon equation is considered , which represents an universal model for studies of nonlinear phenomena in many areas of physics @xcite . in dimensionless form",
    "it can be written as @xmath0 where the subscripts @xmath1 and @xmath2 stand for the partial derivatives with respect of time and space variables , respectively .",

    "these are exponentially localized solitary waves moving with @xmath4 group velocity .",
    "it should be stressed that any higher - order soliton solution of the sine - gordon model consists of the certain number of fundamental solitons .",
    "for example , so - called breather solution represents a bound state of a kink and anti - kink pair @xcite .",
    "therefore , this letter concerns the relaxation dynamics of the fundamental solitons .    for the present discussion it is important that , for small amplitude waves @xmath5 , and therefore , the sine - gordon model reduces to the linear klein - gordon equation which exhibits a band gap @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental question is to how a given initial condition evolves to the soliton solutions .",
    "the sine - gordon equation is an integrable model and the problem can be solved by means of the inverse scattering method @xcite .",
    "the general analysis shows that any initial condition asymptotically relaxes to a certain number of solitons and dispersive radiation .",
    "however , in many interesting cases , the formal evaluation of the solution meets technical difficulties , and therefore , is less useful .",
    "in contrast , the variational approach gives simple and explicit , although approximate , expressions for the solitary wave parameters @xcite .",
    "however , the original version of the method fails to account for changes caused by the dispersion of the radiation @xcite .",
    "that problem was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the generalized variational ansatz was suggested for studies of the nonlinear schrdinger soliton formation processes .",
    "later , the similar analysis was carried out for the sine - gordon equation as well @xcite . in",
    "should be noted that , as compared to the nonlinear schrdinger equation , worse agreement between the approximate theory and the exact numerical results was achieved .",
    "nevertheless , it was found that , an initially deformed soliton experiences damped oscillations while shedding dispersive radiation .",
    "furthermore , far from the soliton core , the radiated waves obey the linear klein - gordon equation provided that the initial deformation is not too strong .    in",
    "what follows , it is demonstrated that the non - markovian effects , caused by the gap of the linearized spectrum , play a crucial role in the sine - gordon soliton formation processes . in particular , while relaxing to the steady state , initially deformed solitons form a bound state with the radiated linear waves .",
    "the similar behavior is known for the decay dynamics of quantum emitters embedded in nanostructures @xcite .",
    "however , first let us introduce a simple model which , as will become apparent below , accounts even quantitatively for the non - markovian relaxation effects .",
    "the suggested model system consists of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a semi - infinite flexible string @xcite .",
    "the string is assumed to be embedded in an elastic matrix , and the reference frame is chosen such that its rest position coincides with the positive @xmath2-axis . then , the transverse displacement of the string @xmath6 obeys the linear klein - gordon equation @xcite : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is determined by the elastic matrix .",
    "the ansatz @xmath9 $ ] gives the dispersion relation for the klein - gordon model @xmath10 . therefore , @xmath8 fixes the band gap size .",
    "the harmonic oscillator is located at the origin and obeys @xcite : @xmath11 u(0,t ) = 2\\gamma u_x(0,t ) \\",
    ", , \\label{osc}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the oscillator eigenfrequency , and @xmath13 is related to the tension of the string .",
    "let us assume that the string is at rest initially .",
    "the solution of eq .   for @xmath14 boundary condition",
    "is well known @xcite . using the expressions derived in ref .",
    "@xcite we can write @xmath15 where the prime denotes the time derivative of the corresponding function , and @xmath16 is the first order bessel function of the first kind . in combination with eq .",
    "that gives @xmath17 this is a linear integro - differential equation which can be readily solved , for example , by means of the laplace transform method @xcite : @xmath18 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times\\left [ f(t ) - \\omega_{\\mathrm{g}}\\int_0^t f\\left(\\sqrt{t^2 - \\tau^2}\\right )   j_1(\\omega_{\\mathrm{g } } \\tau ) \\ , \\mathrm{d } \\tau \\right ] \\ , , \\label{ft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 provided that @xmath20 , and @xmath21 in addition , for @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 , we have @xmath24    the non - markovian effects in the presented model are introduced through the right - hand side of eq .  . for @xmath25",
    "that term vanishes , and the governing equation describes a damped oscillator dynamics @xcite . in particular , for @xmath26 , the system oscillates with the exponentially damped amplitude . for @xmath27 , however , the damping is so strong that the dynamics is essentially aperiodic .",
    "finally , for @xmath28 , the system experiences exponential relaxation to the equilibrium state with no oscillations .",
    "thus , when the gap is absent , the energy transfer from the oscillator to the string obeys the exponential law .    however , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the situation might be completely different for @xmath29 due to the memory effects .",
    "note that , @xmath30 in the considered example .",
    "in addition , is should be stressed that the oscillator eigenfrequency is outside the gap , but close to the band edge .",
    "the system dynamics exhibits the main specific features previously found for quantum emitters decay in photonic band gap materials .",
    "first of all , as compared to the free space , the spontaneous decay rate of an excited atom is enhanced for transition frequencies close to the band edge @xcite . for comparison , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the relaxation of the oscillator for @xmath25 . in the presence of gap , for the relatively short time period @xmath31",
    ", the system damping rate significantly exceeds that of the gapless case .",
    "second , for the quantum emitters , the photon - atom bound state is present even when the transition frequency is outside the gap @xcite .",
    "the analogous phenomenon can be identified in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as well .",
    "indeed , the oscillations of the system persist even for @xmath32 , and the oscillator forms a bound state with the radiated waves . that can be shown by considering the asymptotic behavior of the considered system . in particular , taking the limit @xmath33 and assuming @xmath34 ,",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "as follows @xmath35 this expression determines the allowed values for @xmath36 in the stationary regime .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath37 provided that @xmath36 is real and @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , only those fourier components of @xmath39 remain at @xmath32 , which correspond to the frequencies given by eq .  .",
    "in the considered case eq .   allows only one frequency @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 holds , and the system asymptotically tends to oscillate with the period @xmath42 . the bound state is more pronounced for @xmath43 , and disappears deeper in the band as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "now , let us show that the presented model system describes quantitatively the soliton formation processes for the sine - gordon equation .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , let us consider the evolution of the initially deformed anti - kink solution in the reference frame moving with @xmath4 group velocity @xmath44 \\ , .",
    "\\label{deformed}\\ ] ] here , @xmath45 represents the width of the pulse . note that , the width of the exact anti - kink solution @xmath46 in the chosen reference frame .",
    "moreover , @xmath47 for @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "let us assume that the initial deformation of the soliton is small @xmath51 , so that the generated radiation has small amplitude too .",
    "then , the action functional for the problem under consideration reads @xmath52 the lagrange function of the deformed soliton is @xcite : @xmath53 with the lagrangian density for the sine - gordon model @xmath54    now , according to the variational approach @xcite , let us insert eq .   in the lagrange function for the deformed soliton , to obtain @xcite : @xmath55    the linear waves are radiated due to the nonlinear processes in the core region of the soliton @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the linear waves are generated at @xmath57 and the corresponding lagrange function reads @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the linearized lagrangian density of the sine - gordon model @xmath60 that corresponds to the klein - gordon equation @xmath61 with the forbidden gap size @xmath62 .",
    "thus , assuming that the linear waves obey eq .",
    ", for the variation of the action functional we obtain @xcite : @xmath63 \\delta w \\ , \\mathrm{d } t \\nonumber \\\\           & + \\int^{+\\infty}_{-\\infty } u_x(+\\varepsilon , t ) \\delta u(+\\varepsilon , t ) \\ ,",
    "\\mathrm{d } t \\nonumber \\\\           & -\\int^{+\\infty}_{-\\infty } u_x(-\\varepsilon , t ) \\delta u(-\\varepsilon , t ) \\ , \\mathrm{d }",
    "\\label{actionvariation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term on the right - hand side of this expression corresponds to the soliton part @xcite , while the second and third terms result from the variation of @xmath64 at the boundaries of the soliton core @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed again that , the linear waves are not generated if @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , at the soliton core boundaries , @xmath64 depends on time through @xmath66 .",
    "then , @xmath67 can be expanded in a power series of @xmath68 @xmath69 where we take into account that @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "thus , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 in the linear approximation .",
    "in addition , @xmath74 as can be seen from eq .  .",
    "the same must hold for @xmath75 as well , and so @xmath76    the least action principle @xmath77 , in combination with eqs .   and",
    ", leads to the following governing equation for @xmath66 @xmath78    it is clear that @xmath79 .",
    "nevertheless , the variational method treats the deformed soliton as a point particle @xcite .",
    "for that reason , the actual value for @xmath80 is not needed for our purposes .",
    "therefore , for the sake of convenience , formally we can choose @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath6 obeys eq .  , and so , @xmath82 is given by eq .",
    "with @xmath62 and @xmath83 . finally , since @xmath84 , the left - hand side of eq .   can be linearized with respect of @xmath68 to give @xmath85 with @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , the deformed soliton dynamics in the sine - gordon model is governed by eq .  , with the solution given by eq .  .",
    "in this case , @xmath13 represents the coupling constant of the linear radiation to the soliton core .",
    "however , since the soliton and dispersive radiation are the constituents of the same solution of the sine - gordon equation , it is expected that the order of magnitude of @xmath13 is @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , it is clear that , in the absence of the gap the soliton relaxation process would be exponential . that is , according to the discussion given above , @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , the choice @xmath90 guarantees very good agreement with the numerical simulations of the sine - gordon equation .",
    "there is a subtle point which appears important for comparison of the model calculations with the exact solutions of eq .  .",
    "in particular , eq .",
    "is obtained by solving a boundary value problem with no linear waves at @xmath91 .",
    "however , the evolution of the deformed solitons for eq .   represents an initial value problem .",
    "therefore , in general , we need to solve a mixed boundary and initial value problem for eq .  .",
    "nevertheless , in many interesting cases , the presented boundary value problem for eq .   still can be utilized to obtain the relevant solution for the comparison .",
    "for example , consider the initial value problem for eq .",
    "defined by eq .   with sufficiently small @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "note that , the initial deformation extends over the whole space . in the sine - gordon equation",
    "such a perturbation represents linear radiation everywhere but the soliton core region .",
    "in contrast , eqs .   and show that the linear waves are generated for @xmath94 . the considered initial condition for eq .   corresponds to a solution of eq .   at certain @xmath95 . to show that , the initial phase shift @xmath96 between the model calculations and the numerical solution of the sine - gordon equation must be introduced .",
    "simultaneously , the choice of @xmath97 must guarantee that @xmath98 .",
    "note that , @xmath99 is an arbitrary constant in general .",
    "thus , it is necessary to adjust @xmath100 to @xmath99 . for this purpose we should solve eq .   numerically .",
    "then , the solution of the given boundary value problem with the appropriately chosen @xmath96 , results in the relevant mixed boundary and initial value problem at @xmath95 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows an example of such calculation .",
    "note that , since @xmath101 is enforced , the solution of eq .   exhibits a kink at @xmath95 .",
    "an excellent quantitative agreement between the numerical solutions of eqs .   and should be emphasized .",
    "the approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite gives only qualitative agreement with the exact numerical results .",
    "in general , according to the discussion given above , the phase shift @xmath96 depends on the initial perturbation . however , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for the considered initial value problem @xmath102 for other values of @xmath103 as well .",
    "that is not surprising since eq .",
    "is linear .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath104 and @xmath105 the phase shift @xmath96 is different .",
    "an example is presented in fig .",
    "in contrast , it must be stressed that @xmath90 holds for any initial value problem .    in the present article the evolution of the initially deformed solitons",
    "is treated in the reference frame moving with @xmath4 group velocity . that is possible if the solitons travel with constant velocity while relaxing to the steady state .",
    "the relativistic invariance of the sine - gordon model guarantees that this is the case .",
    "indeed , let us consider the deformed soliton with @xmath106 . from the symmetry of the stated problem",
    "it directly follows that the soliton does not accelerate during the relaxation process .",
    "now , consider the same soliton in the reference frame moving with arbitrary velocity @xmath107 . in that moving reference frame",
    "the soliton travels with the group velocity @xmath108 .",
    "since the soliton does not accelerate in the original reference frame , according to the special relativity , it does not accelerate in any other inertial reference frame too .",
    "that is , while relaxing , the moving deformed soliton propagates with the constant velocity .    the studied soliton oscillations at @xmath109 have different origin as compared to the wobbling kink solutions of the @xmath110 and the sine - gordon models found in ref .",
    "indeed , in the case of @xmath110 model , the kink oscillations are due to the linear discrete eigenmode of the system on the static kink background .",
    "the sine - gordon kinks do not possess such eigenstates .",
    "the wobbling kink of the sine - gordon model represents a three - soliton solution , and so , is an intrinsically nonlinear excitation .",
    "in contrast , the extremely long - lived oscillations of the sine - gordon solitons studied here are governed by the linear equation .",
    "the deformed solitons asymptotically tend to the stationary oscillatory state which is caused solely by the forbidden band gap . that represents the bound state of the soliton with the radiated linear waves .",
    "finally , note that , the memory effects can be identified in the nonlinear schrdinger soliton formation processes as well @xcite .",
    "the linear spectrum of that equation does not possess a forbidden gap .",
    "nevertheless , in certain limiting cases it correctly accounts for the effects associated with band gaps .",
    "for instance , that is the case for nonlinear photonic band gap materials @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the weakly nonlinear regime , the sine - gordon model reduces to the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "therefore , in that limiting case of the sine - gordon equation , it should not be surprising to find the effects reminiscent of non - markovian dynamics .    in conclusion",
    ", a generalized variational approach is developed to model the soliton formation processes for the sine - gordon model .",
    "it is shown that , if the initial soliton deformation is not too strong , the system dynamics is governed by the linear integro - differential equation . the detailed analytical and numerical examination of the suggested model indicates that the soliton relaxation dynamics exhibits the main specific features of quantum emitters decay processes in photonic band gap materials .",
