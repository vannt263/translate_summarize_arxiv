    "the past decade has seen extraordinary improvement in our understanding of supermassive black holes ( smbhs )  their growth and evolution , and their links with their host galaxies .",
    "we now realize that galaxies hosting smbhs at their centers are the rule rather than the exception .",
    "the observed correlations of the masses @xmath1 of the smbhs with properties of their host galaxies , for example with the bulge stellar velocity dispersion @xcite , show that there is a close link between the formation and evolution of galaxies and of the smbhs they host .",
    "furthermore , a comparison of the smbh mass function required to explain the observed luminosity function of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with estimates of the local smbh mass function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that not only must smbhs be very common in massive galaxies but that most , if not all , of these black holes are relics of agns active in previous epochs .",
    "thus knowledge of the local smbh mass function enables us to put constraints on theories of galaxy and smbh formation and growth , and agn lifetimes .",
    "estimates of the local smbh mass function are anchored by resolved stellar or gas dynamical measurements of the masses of @xmath2 smbhs ( see , e.g. , the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and otherwise based on the distribution of host galaxy properties ( luminosity of the bulge or bulge stellar velocity dispersion @xmath3 ) and known scaling relationships between the mass of the smbh and these properties ( most prominently @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; but see @xcite for a more direct estimate ) .",
    "most of the measured smbh masses are @xmath6 or greater , however , as the sphere of influence of a less massive smbh is extremely hard to resolve even at moderate distances , even with _",
    "hst_. for example , the sphere of influence of a @xmath7 smbh at 15 mpc is @xmath2 milliarcseconds ( mas ) . as a result , while different estimates of the mass function agree for @xmath8 , the low - mass end ( @xmath9 ) often has discrepancies ( see , e.g. , fig .  7 of * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comparison of different authors estimates of the mass function ) .",
    "a second source of uncertainty at the low - mass end is the fact that it is unknown how the scaling relationships extrapolate to very late - type spiral galaxies , which have little or no bulge component , and to very low mass galaxies ( de and dsph ) .",
    "yet smbhs _ do _ exist in very late - type spirals , e.g.  ngc 4395 , a spiral galaxy of type sdm , with @xmath10 @xcite , and in very low mass galaxies , e.g.  pox 52 , a dwarf galaxy , with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "questions that naturally arise at this point are : do the scaling relationships break down at low masses ? what determines the mass of an smbh : the mass of the bulge or the mass of the dark matter halo ? is there a lower bound to the local smbh mass function ? a well defined sample of low - mass smbhs is needed to answer these questions .",
    "since we can not detect low - mass smbhs by their dynamical signature , looking for them by signs of their accretion activity may be the only viable way of detecting them .",
    "this of course limits detection to the subset of low - mass black holes that are active , but this fraction can be expected to be large , for the following reason .",
    "we now understand that the `` quasar era '' is a function of luminosity , with the space density of the most luminous quasars peaking at high redshift and that of lower luminosity quasars peaking at progressively lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "this is often referred to as the `` downsizing '' of agn activity with cosmic epoch . moreover , at least some models of black hole growth @xcite require anti - hierarchical growth .",
    "that is , higher mass smbhs attain most of their mass at high redshift while lower mass smbhs grow at progressively lower redshifts .",
    "the trends of agn downsizing and anti - hierarchical growth , extended logically to the smallest mass smbhs , imply that these objects were active in recent times and may still be accreting at the present epoch .",
    "the eddington luminosity of a @xmath12 smbh is only @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 ; low - mass smbhs , even if accreting at high rates , will be low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) .",
    "the converse is not true ; that is , not all llagns have a low - mass smbh .",
    "in addition to a low smbh mass , the low luminosity of an llagn may be caused by a low rate or radiatively inefficient mode of accretion to an smbh of any mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* present a study of massive smbhs accreting at very low rates ) .",
    "finally , obscuration may further lower the observed luminosity .",
    "low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) nuclei have been studied at multiple wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to identify llagns among them , and these studies have demonstrated that these agns are not necessarily the same type of object with the same physical characteristics .",
    "since we are interested specifically in the low - mass end of the smbh mass function , it is necessary to identify among the agns those that can be expected to have the smallest black holes .",
    "one approach is to use mass estimators based on the luminosity of the agn and the width of the broad component of emission lines in its spectrum .",
    "this is the technique that was used by @xcite in constructing their sample of low - mass smbhs . a second approach , and the one we use , is to look for agn activity in galaxies ( late - type spirals , dwarf galaxies ) where the known host galaxy - smbh scaling relationships predict the lowest - mass smbhs would reside .",
    "this approach has been used by @xcite to find candidate low - mass smbhs .",
    "however , the scaling relationships are only statistical and can not be used to estimate the mass of a particular smbh ; thus the second approach requires an independent estimate of the smbh mass .",
    "a search for active low - mass smbhs requires confirmation of the presence of an agn in each candidate nucleus , and measurement of the mass of the smbhs in the confirmed agns .",
    "the method used by @xcite has the virtue of effectively combining all of the above into a single step .",
    "however , as the luminosity of an agn decreases , the optical spectrum of the galaxy nucleus becomes more and more dominated by host galaxy light , and the signature of the agn becomes difficult to detect .",
    "even when the optical spectrum shows no clear evidence of an agn , however , such evidence may still be present in other wavelengths , such as x - ray and radio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and infrared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of nuclear activity in nearby galaxies ) . for the lowest - luminosity agns , therefore , it is possible that a system based on optical spectra would not classify the nuclei as agns at all .",
    "we choose to use x - ray selection to identify candidate agns for the following reasons : first , x - rays can penetrate obscuring material which may be hiding the line emitting regions .",
    "second , there are fewer sources of x - rays in a galaxy than there are of optical and uv emission and so dilution of the agn signature by host galaxy light is less of a problem . where the luminosity of the agn is low to begin with",
    ", even a modest amount of absorption may result in the signal being below the optical background imposed by the galaxy .",
    "third , even if , as expected in some theories @xcite agns that have luminosities or accretion rates below a cut - off value do not have broad - line regions , they should still be detectable in x - rays .",
    "x - ray observations have in fact detected agns in what were thought to be `` normal '' galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the disadvantage , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] , is that x - ray observations by themselves can not always distinguish between agns and other x - ray sources , such as x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) and ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "multi - wavelength data are needed to determine the type of source .    as the first step towards assembling a sample of low - mass smbhs",
    ", we are conducting an x - ray survey of nearby ( within 20 mpc ) , _ quiescent _ spiral galaxies using the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory to look for nuclear x - ray sources , with an emphasis on late - type spirals .",
    "the high angular resolution of _ chandra _  is necessary to ensure that any detected source is really at the center and is not an off - nuclear source .",
    "the survey is sensitive to an ( unobscured ) smbh of mass @xmath15 radiating at @xmath16 out to the survey limit .",
    "we will present details of the survey sample selection and the _ chandra _  observations in a future paper . here",
    ", we present the methods used and the feasibility of detecting agns using these methods by applying them to six galaxies that meet selection criteria similar to those used for the survey sample , and for which x - ray data already exist in the _ chandra _  archive .    the paper is organized as follows :  [ sec : sampsel ] describes the criteria used to select the six galaxies presented here ;  [ sec : datan ] describes the observations and data analysis , with individual targets discussed in   [ sec : n3169][sec : n5457 ] ; the results are discussed in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "starting with third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we imposed the following main filters .",
    "( 1 ) morphological type : we selected spiral galaxies of type sa through sd ( @xmath17 ) ; ( 2 ) distance : galaxies that had recession velocity @xmath18 km s@xmath14 ; ( 3 ) galactic latitude : @xmath19 to avoid x - ray absorption by gas in our own galaxy ; ( 4 ) inclination : we required @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the projected lengths of the semi - major and semi - minor axes , respectively .",
    "this was to avoid obscuration by the disk of the host galaxy ; ( 5 ) nuclear inactivity : the galaxy must _ not _ be known to be an agn or starburst .",
    "starbursts were excluded since the vigorous star formation also increases the likelihood of the presence of xrbs and ulxs .",
    "liners were included as there is still debate about whether the fundamental source of energy in these nuclei is an agn or star formation .",
    "we also required that the object have the value of the `` goodposition '' flag set to 1 in the rc3 table in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) database , which indicated that the coordinates of the galaxy were accurate to 0.1 s in ra and @xmath23 in dec .",
    "all objects passing these filters were cross - correlated with sdss data release 3 , with a match radius of @xmath24 .",
    "this resulted in a list of 76 galaxies .",
    "this list was then checked against publicly available data in the _ chandra _  archive .",
    "the final sample consists of six galaxies : ngc 3169 ( sa ) , ngc 3184 ( scd ) , ngc 4102 ( sb ) , ngc 4647 ( sc ) , ngc 4713 ( sd ) , and ngc 5457 ( scd ) .",
    "details of the observations that were analyzed are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "x - ray data were downloaded from the _ chandra _  archive and analyzed using version 3.4 of _ chandra _  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software . in each case the level 2 event list was processed using the observation - specific bad - pixel file and the latest calibration files , and filtered to exclude times when the instrument experienced a background flare .",
    "the event lists were then converted to fits images and the ciao wavelet source detection tool _",
    "wavdetect _ was run on them to determine source positions . for each observation ,",
    "source counts were extracted from a circle centered on the _ wavdetect _ source position , and with a radius equal to the greater of 4.67 pixels ( @xmath25 ) and the 95% encircled - energy radius at 1.5 kev on acis - s at the position of the source .",
    "background counts were taken from an annulus with an inner radius of twice , and an outer radius of five times , the source circle radius after excising any sources that happened to fall in the background region .",

    "we note here that we use `` nuclear flux '' to refer to the total background - subtracted flux at the location of the nucleus .",

    "the contribution of the agn , even if present , will be a small fraction of the nuclear flux in the optical and uv bands . in most cases , therefore , we expect the fluxes and colors to be consistent with the _ absence _ of an agn .",

    "individual targets are discussed below . for each target , we first describe the observed properties in the x - ray , and then in other wavebands when such observations exist .",

    "* ) . in xrbs",
    ", the steep power - law state is associated with the presence of quasi - periodic oscillations in the x - ray emission , while the hard state is associated with the presence of a radio jet . in principle",
    "the presence of these features could provide additional evidence supporting the xrb hypothesis , but it is not currently feasible to detect them in xrbs at the distance of ngc 5457 .    thus , there are again two possible scenarios , as in the case of ngc 3184",
    ". the x - ray source could be an hmxb in a super - star cluster .",
    "the star cluster would dominate the optical and ir emission .",
    "the large variation observed in the x - ray flux rules out the source s being more than one hmxb , as otherwise they would have to be varying in concert .",
    "the actual amount of obscuration is important , however , for the plausibility of the hmxb hypothesis since the inferred x - ray luminosity ( @xmath195 erg s@xmath14  in the high state ) is already at the high end of the range of xrb luminosities and there is not much room for a significantly higher absorption - corrected intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the alternative scenario is an agn together with a nuclear star cluster . in agns",
    "both the intrinsic luminosity and the amount of obscuration are known to vary .",
    "the low state x - ray spectrum may be explained as a truly under - luminous ( @xmath196 erg s@xmath14 ) unabsorbed agn , or as an agn where the obscuration is so high that only scattered light , and no direct emission , is seen .",
    "the fact that the x - ray colors are similar to those of compton - thick agn @xcite supports the latter view , but we also note the absence of the @xmath197 kev fe k@xmath100 line in the x - ray spectrum that is often present in the reflected component . though both the hmxb and agn hypotheses are possible , on balance the agn appears to be the more plausible one .",
    "the motivation for this paper was to evaluate the feasibility of detecting low - mass smbhs in late - type spiral galaxies , which may still be accreting at the current epoch and if so should be detectable in x - rays .",
    "the six galaxies studied in this paper are not all late - type , but span the range sa ",
    "ngc 3169 and ngc 4102 were regarded as low luminosity agns .",
    "none of the remaining four nuclei , however , was known to have an accreting smbh , of any mass .",
    "ngc 3169 and ngc 4102 are of type sa and sb , which have massive bulges and are expected to have massive smbhs .",
    "for galaxies of types scd and sd , on the other hand , the lack of a luminous agn could mean either that there is no smbh or that the mass of the smbh is low .",
    "as such , the observations studied here examine both aspects of a search for accreting low - mass smbh : first , are these objects really detectable , given that the accretion rate is expected to be low ?",
    "second , are any sources detected in the very latest type spiral galaxies that have small or no bulges ?    we first note that of the six galaxies presented here , all six show nuclear x - ray sources .",
    "this implies that it is a very common occurrence . in a survey of late - type spiral galaxies such as our ongoing _",
    "chandra _",
    "survey , therefore , the predominant concern is not going to be detection efficiency , but rather identification of the agns among the detected sources .",
    "given that the sample presented in this paper consists of only six galaxies , we do not draw statistical conclusions here of the prevalence of very low - luminosity agns in nearby galaxies .",
    "but we note that , as shown in   3.13.6 , of the six nuclear x - ray sources , ngc 3169",
    "is almost certainly an agn , and ngc 4102 , ngc 3184 , and ngc 5457 , have very strong , though not conclusive , arguments in favor of their being agns .",
    "the two remaining galaxies , ngc 4713 and ngc 4647 , are ambiguous but agns are not ruled out .",
    "we discuss below the issues such surveys will face when attempting to identify the nature of the detected sources .",
    "the diagnostic tools traditionally used to distinguish agns from non - agns ( e.g.  optical line ratios , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were developed in the course of studying luminous agn .",
    "dilution of the agn emission by host galaxy light was not a serious problem and observations with low spatial resolution ( several arcseconds ) sufficed . in the study of agn that are either intrinsically less luminous or are heavily obscured , however , host galaxy light becomes increasingly problematic , and surveys relying on optical spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) require careful subtraction of the starlight using galactic spectral templates . in the weakest agns",
    ", however , signs of agn emission may not be detected by the usual diagnostics .",
    "this problem will persist until optical observations with angular resolution of 110 mas become possible so that host galaxy light can be effectively excluded , though it can be mitigated by using regions of the spectrum where host galaxy emission is negligible , for example very high energy x - rays ( tens to hundreds of kev ) .",
    "the detection of a compact radio source unresolved at milliarcsecond - scales , especially if the source is accompanied by jets , would also unambiguously identify the nucleus as an agn .",
    "this has been the motivation for radio surveys like that of @xcite .",
    "some agns obscured in the optical and uv may be detectable using infrared emission line strengths and ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    while the methods listed above allow the unambiguous identification of agns , observations often do not have the angular resolution or sensitivity to distinguish agn and non - agn flux .",
    "other sources of radiation in the vicinity of the agn are , for example , plasma photoionized by the agn itself , or a nuclear star cluster .",
    "the targeted agns have very low luminosity and thus even moderate amounts of obscuration may cause a significant decrement in the observed flux . in most cases , therefore , the agn contribution should not be expected to dominate the total observed flux .",
    "consequently , identifying these agns requires a different approach than what can be used in the case of the more luminous agns ( seyferts and qsos ) .",
    "agns can be identified using x - ray observations ( e.g.  with _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _ ) solely , but only if they are point sources whose inferred luminosities are greater than @xmath198 erg s@xmath14 . below that value",
    ", agns can become indistinguishable from ulxs and xrbs in x - rays .",
    "ulxs can have luminosities of a few times @xmath30 erg s@xmath14(e.g .",
    "* ) and have x - ray spectra that look similar to agn spectra .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that ulx spectra show a break at @xmath199 kev .",
    "agns are not known to show this break . in high quality spectra with a large number of counts it may be possible to exploit this difference to separate ulxs and agns .",
    "xrbs have power law spectra with @xmath200 , can show an fe k@xmath100 emission line , and emit hard x - rays , all characteristics of agns as well . additionally , even with _",
    "chandra _ s angular resolution , the physical space probed ranges from the central @xmath201 10 to 100 pc of the galaxy",
    ". the existence of one or more xrbs within that region would be unsurprising .",
    "however , the fact that the inferred luminosities are as high as @xmath202 erg s@xmath14  severely constrains the expected number of xrbs .",
    "for example , for ngc 5457 , one of the four galaxies presented here that are not confirmed agns , @xcite provide a log n - log s relation as well as the surface density of x - ray point sources as a function of radius ( their figs .  3 and 4 ) .",
    "approximately 12.5% of the sources have luminosities exceeding @xmath196 erg s@xmath14 .",
    "the surface density of sources in the innermost @xmath203 is @xmath204 arcmin@xmath205 .",
    "therefore we may expect @xmath206 sources arcmin@xmath205 above the luminosity cut - off in the central @xmath203 , or @xmath207 such sources within the _ chandra_source circle of radius @xmath25 that has been used here .",
    "ngc 5457 is of type scd , and can be taken to be representative of the other three galaxies , ngc 4647 , ngc 3184 , and ngc 4713 which are types sc , scd , and sd , respectively . thus invoking xrbs and ulxs alone to explain the x - ray observations leads to physically implausible conditions , such as requiring that most , or all , quiescent , non - starburst spiral galaxies have a ulx or @xmath208 xrbs in the central @xmath209",
    "nevertheless , x - ray observations by themselves will usually be inadequate to distinguish agns from non - agns in any particular instance .",
    "information from other wavebands is thus crucial for the identification process .",
    "for the six galaxies in this paper multi - wavelength photometry is summarized in tables  [ tab : lum ] and [ tab : n31spitz ] . but here too , traditional methods of identifying agns using flux ratios such as @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 , must be used with caution .",
    "the low luminosities of the agns mean that the emission in the two bands being compared may not be from the same object . for instance",
    ", for an obscured agn surrounded by a nuclear star cluster , the observed x - ray flux may be from the agn but the optical flux may be dominated by the cluster .",
    "the existence of an agn must instead be inferred by consistency and plausibility checks considering as much of the spectral energy distribution as possible , and the goal is the rejection of the hypothesis that all of the observed properties can be explained without requiring the presence of an agn .",
    "ngc 3184 provides a good example where different modes of observing , imaging and spectroscopy , in two wavebands , x - ray and ir , together make a compelling argument for the presence of an agn where each observation individually is ambiguous .",
    "nuclear star clusters are fairly common in spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a cluster poses two main problems .",
    "first , it makes the presence of xrbs more likely .",
    "second , if the cluster is young and contains many o and b stars , it may overwhelm agn emission in the uv in addition to the optical ( e.g. ngc 4303 , * ? ? ? * ) . it may be possible in some cases , as for ngc 1042 @xcite and ngc 4102 @xcite , to attempt a separation of the cluster and agn components in the optical spectrum .",
    "in addition , stellar spectra , even for late - type stars , fall faster towards the infrared than the power - laws typical of agns .",
    "the mid - infrared colors of agns , therefore , tend to be redder than those of stellar populations and this color difference can be used to infer the presence of an agn @xcite .",
    "in addition to the spectral energy distribution , source variability can be a discriminant , as agns are known to vary in all wavelengths , whereas a star cluster , say , would not .",
    "conversely , if the variation is periodic it would rule out an agn and argue for an xrb instead .    a survey of the type discussed here finds agns and strong agn candidates , but does not measure the masses of the smbhs in those agns .",
    "measurement of the mass of one of these smbhs will be a difficult endeavor , since the sphere of influence of the black hole can not be resolved with current technology and resources .",
    "none of the six objects studied in this paper shows broad optical emission lines whose widths could be used to estimate the bh mass , and this is likely to be typical behavior .",
    "spectropolarimetry may uncover broad lines in polarized light in some of the agns .",
    "estimates of the smbh mass may be made by using known scaling relationships , with the caveat that the correlations are all based on smbhs two or more orders of magnitude more massive than the ones expected to be found by the survey .",
    "the least indirect method is an application of the observed correlation between the x - ray power law slope and eddington ratio @xcite .",
    "the eddington ratio and the luminosity in turn provide an estimate of the mass of the smbh .",
    "other relationships that can be used are : ( a ) the @xmath1@xmath3 relation @xcite , but this method becomes more and more uncertain as the bulge itself becomes ill - defined in the latest - type spirals ; ( b ) the @xmath1@xmath213 relationship @xcite , which has more scatter and also faces the problem of the definition of the bulge ; ( c ) the @xmath1@xmath214 relation @xcite , which has the advantage that it does not require the presence of a well - defined bulge ; ( d ) the @xmath1@xmath215 relation @xcite , where @xmath215 is the concentration of light .",
    "there is also a reported relationship between black hole mass and core radio power @xcite , but this relationship is not as well established as the others , and is based on observations of elliptical galaxies , so its applicability to the spiral galaxies here is uncertain .",
    "overall , there is unlikely to be one standard method of measurement that can be applied to these galaxies , but one or more of the above methods may provide useful estimates of or limits to the masses of the smbhs in these agns .",
    "mass measurements independent of the scaling relationships are possible if an object turns out to have broad emission lines , like ngc 4395 , in which case line widths or reverberation mapping may be used , or if it has maser emission , like ngc 4258 , in which case gas dynamics can be used .",
    "mass measurement in other cases will have to await mas - scale angular resolution in bands other than radio to resolve the sphere of influence of these black holes .",
    "of the six galaxies here , ngc 3169 , ngc 4102 , and ngc 5457 have measurements of either the stellar velocity dispersion or the luminosity of the bulge , thus allowing an estimate of their smbh masses ( assuming here that the source in m 101 is an agn ) .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath1@xmath3 and @xmath1@xmath213 relations , together with the uncertainty in the observed flux and the bolometric correction , result in uncertainties of about an order of magnitude in the inferred eddington ratio , but all three objects have @xmath216 .",
    "this is in the range seen in low - luminosity agns ( e.g. @xmath217 for m 81 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and much higher than the @xmath218 seen in truly quiescent smbhs .",
    "these observations indicate that there is indeed a population of accreting smbhs in nearby spiral galaxies that do not show optical signs of activity but can be uncovered by looking for their x - ray emission .",
    "such a population will answer the question of whether the bulge is the dominant component that determines the existence , and mass , of a nuclear smbh .",
    "the discoveries of agns in the sd galaxies ngc 4395 @xcite and ngc 3621 @xcite , and the strong evidence for agns in the scd galaxies ngc 3184 and ngc 5457 suggest it is not , at least as far as existence is concerned . among the smbhs discovered in the latest - type spirals ( with small or no bulges ) and in the lowest - mass galaxies should be a population of smbhs with masses less than @xmath7 , enabling a systematic study of the low - mass end of the local supermassive black hole mass function .",
