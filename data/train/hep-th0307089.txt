    "since the seminal work of seiberg and witten@xcite it was realized that open strings in the presence of an antisymmetric constant background are effectively described at low energy by certain noncommutative field theories , identified by a precise set of feynman rules@xcite .",
    "these theories are similar to the ones appearing in previous works@xcite , where the necessity of a space - time uncertainty principle when quantum mechanics couples with general relativity was realized , and subsequently a consistent quantum field theory in such a noncommutative setup was tentatively constructed .",
    "however , there are many important differences among these two formulations which have some drastic effects , in particular for what concerns the problem of unitarity : the former were proven to lose perturbative unitarity when time is involved in the noncommutativity@xcite , while the latter are made free from this problem@xcite .",
    "we will not discuss here the problems related to the latter , and to the extension of the quantum field theory axiomatic framework to the noncommutative case ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we will instead concentrate our attention on the former .",
    "the derivation by seiberg and witten was originally made for magnetic backgrounds only , corresponding to space - space noncommutativity ( for the light - like case see @xcite ) . for electric backgrounds",
    "it is well known that problems are present when the electric field approaches a critical value @xmath0 , beyond which the string develops a classical instability@xcite : tachyonic masses appear in the spectrum both for neutral ( which is the case we will consider here ) and charged open strings , connected with the vanishing of the effective tension and an uncontrolled growth of the oscillation amplitude of the modes in the direction parallel to the field . for purely charged strings",
    "this phenomenon ( which has no analog in particle field theory ) coexists with the quantum instability due to pair production which is the analog of the schwinger phenomenon in particle electrodynamics - charge on one end , @xmath1 on the other ) , one has @xmath2 . for charges @xmath3 on the two boundaries ,",
    "one finds that the pair production rate diverges at the same critical value of the classical instability @xmath4 .",
    "when one tries to perform the seiberg - witten zero - slope limit to noncommutative field theories one reaches a point in which the ratio between the electric field and its critical value becomes greater than one , and the string enters the region of instability . we will show that precisely at this point a flip - mechanism produces the appearance of the tachyonic branch cut due to the closed string sector in the non - planar diagrams , which is responsible for the lack of unitarity of the limit amplitude .",
    "we relate the breaking of perturbative unitarity of these space - time noncommutative theories with the fact that they coincide with those obtained by freezing string theory in an unstable vacuum .",
    "this vacuum is likely to decay in the full string theory to a suitable configuration of branes .",
    "results will be presented as follows : in section 2 we will describe the generic bosonic string amplitude for tachyons on external legs , and then specify it for the two - point case , for which we show the appearance of the flip mechanism@xcite .",
    "this will be a very primitive setup , which in its elementary form already reveals the phenomenon .",
    "we will then perform some improvements through a more complicated example : in section 3 we will analyse the four - tachyon amplitude , in order to overcome the problem of the off - shell continuation .",
    "we will then stress the universality of the phenomenon with respect to the dimension of the brane - worldvolume . in section 4",
    "we will mention the ncos limit .",
    "finally we will conclude and comment on future improvements , especially the perspective to reproduce this mechanism starting from a fully consistent superstring theory .",
    "we take as action for a bosonic open string attached to a d - brane lying in the first @xmath5 dimensions with an antisymmetric constant background on its worldvolume the following @xmath6 at one loop the string world - sheet is the cylinder @xmath7 } ; @xmath8 is the modulus .",
    "we are taking the indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 to live on the brane .",
    "the one loop propagator we adopt in this situation , with the new boundary conditions imposed by the @xmath11-term , can be found in @xcite .",

    "we perform the zero - slope limit of seiberg and witten , which consists in sending @xmath41 keeping @xmath42 and @xmath43 fixed ( in this case we will keep @xmath44 and @xmath45 fixed as well ) .",

    "the electric field approaches indefinitely its critical value from below , never passing the stability threshold .",
    "the only difference with respect to the case before the limit is in the exponential which contains the closed string metric @xmath90 , whose entries in the @xmath91 block tend to zero .",

    "we see therefore that the amplitude is protected against the flip - mechanism .",
    "the closed string pole disappears , which points towards the decoupling of the closed string sector .",
    "we roughly reproduce at this perturbative order in the bosonic string theory the noncommutative open string ( ncos ) limit@xcite : this is an open string theory limit decoupled from closed string .",
    "we have shown that it is generally possible to connect the lack of unitarity of string - derived noncommutative field theories with the appearance of a tachyonic branch cut due to the closed sector in non - planar diagrams , which appears when one enters the region of instability of the neutral open string in the background of an electric field , when it overcomes a critical value basically equal to the string tension over the endpoint charge .",
    "this phenomenon was seen in the calculation of the bosonic two - point function , where an off - shell continuation is compulsory in order to compare with the field - theoretical analysis .",
    "we removed this arbitrariness by considering an on - shell four - tachyon amplitude and we realized the universality of this process .",
    "we discussed the dependence on the worldvolume of the brane and what happens for a brane which fills the space .",
    "+ the next step should be to single out this phenomenon in a fully consistent superstring theory , where the presence of the tachyon contribution is ruled out from the beginning .",
    "a typical setup could be for example type iib superstring with a stack of coincident @xmath94-branes , with an ns - ns two - form background turned on on their worldvolume , and analyzing incoming massless states from the spectrum of the open string living on them .",
    "the effective field theory action will be in this case a space - time noncommutative supersymmetric theory . from this kind of analysis one could also try to understand some issues regarding uv / ir singularities which have obscure meaning on the field theory side even in the magnetic case@xcite .",
    "a more ambitious project regards the formulation of this analysis in the framework of the open string field theory .",
    "the aim should be to reproduce not only the complete analysis of singularities for off - shell amplitudes , but to clarify the fate of the unstable vacuum and indicate a path of brane - decay for this situation .",
    "+ finally , we mentioned a bosonic realization of the ncos regime , where open strings decouple from closed ones and from gravity .",
    "this theory is quite particular , since it contains open strings only , and it may help in singling out some features of pure open strings and gauge theories when slowly turning off the gravity sector@xcite . +",
    "this work has been done in collaboration with antonio bassetto and roberto valandro of the university of padua .",
