    "in order to simplify the description of colloidal systems , one often tries to determine effective interactions between the colloidal particles , thus integrating out the solvent s degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this is not a trivial task , because in general the effective interactions depend on the thermodynamic state of the system , and one is often confronted with the problem of thermodynamic inconsistencies  @xcite .",
    "a problem that is of particular interest is that of effective interactions between charged colloids ( macroions ) in an electrolyte solution . on a mean  field level , such",
    "a system can be described by the poisson ",
    "boltzmann ( pb ) equation @xcite .",
    "the linearized version of this equation is the basis of the dlvo theory for charged colloids  @xcite , and we will refer to it in the following as the debye  hckel ( dh ) limit of the pb equation @xcite . in the dh limit , the problem can be solved analytically and yields a screened coulomb potential for the effective interactions between the macroions .",
    "the characteristic range of this potential is given by the debye length @xmath0 , which is controled by solvent properties such as the salt concentration .",
    "the physical picture of the dh description is rather appealing : due to the charge of a macroion , a layer of thickness @xmath0 is formed around it , consisting of oppositely charged microions ( counterions ) , leading to a screening of the bare coulomb interaction .",
    "although the dh description is only valid for weakly charged macroions and if correlation effects between the microions in the electrolyte solution can be neglected , it is tempting to characterize also the effective interactions between highly charged macroions by a potential of screened coulomb form .",
    "indeed , this is the idea of the famous concept of charge renormalization that has been put forward by alexander _",
    "et al . _",
    "it is based on the observation that in the framework of the so  called cell model ( see below ) the numerical solution of the nonlinear pb equation can be fitted farther away from the macroions boundaries by a screened coulomb potential with a renormalized charge @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 the bare charge of a macroion ) .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite recently extended the numerical recipe of alexander _ et al . _  by providing an analytical scheme to calculate @xmath3 as well as the effective screening length and the effective salt concentration .",
    "as already mentioned , dh theory is based on the linearized pb equation , which implies pairwise additivity of interaction energies . on the other hand , for highly charged macroions",
    ", nonlinearities imply the occurrence of many  body interactions and thus pairwise additivity does not hold .",
    "the simplest system , in which many  body effects could be expected , consists of three isolated macroions in an electrolyte solution .",
    "indeed , such a system has been studied in a recent experiment using scanned optical line tweezers @xcite . in this",
    "work , charge  stabilized silica particles with a diameter of about 1@xmath4 m suspended in water were considered .",
    "it was possible to measure three  body interactions directly , and it was found that , in agreement with numerical solutions of the nonlinear pb equation @xcite , three ",
    "body contributions to the total interaction energy are attractive .",
    "also molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulations have been used to investigate systems of `` isolated '' macroion pairs and triples @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "charged colloids were investigated in the framework of the so  called primitive model . in this model , a system of macroions , counterions and salt ions is considered without explicitly taking into account the uncharged part of the solvent .",
    "based on the primitive model , allahyarov and lwen found that dh theory works well for a system of two macroions @xcite , and , in agreement with experiment @xcite and pb theory @xcite , that three ",
    "body contributions are attractive in the case of three macroions @xcite .",
    "these authors also studied a system of two macroions , in which uncharged solvent particles were added to the electrolyte solution @xcite .",
    "an interesting finding of this work was that the neutral solvent leads to a renormalized charge , which is smaller than the bare charge of the macroions , similar to the concept proposed by alexander _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in a different simulation study by tehver _",
    "@xcite , the counterions were introduced via density distributions in the framework of a density functional theory .",
    "surprisingly , in the case of three macroions , no evidence for many ",
    "body forces was found , and the forces could be well described by dh theory .    in this work , md simulations are presented that tie in with the previous simulation studies .",
    "we consider systems of two and three highly charged macroions in a primitive model solvent . in the two  particle case , we check to what extent dh theory describes the effective interactions ; thereby",
    ", the effect of nonlinearities is quantified .",
    "this is done for different amounts of added salt , focussing on the limit of small salt concentrations . in a second step , we address the influence of nonlinear effects on three - body interactions . in order to study these effects , a triple of macroions",
    "is considered in two different geometries by placing the macroions on an equililateral triangle or along a straight line .",
    "we check on whether the concept of charge renormalization can also be applied to isolated pairs or triples of particles .",
    "furthermore , we ask for the validity of the mean  field description and how effective interactions develop from the two  particle case to the bulk .",
    "our major concern is the influence of nonlinearity , which can be seen for high macroion charges and low salt concentrations .",
    "we especially consider cases of overlapping or interacting debye - layers in the case of non  bulklike macroion configurations .    our paper is organized as follows : after briefly discussing some results of dh theory and the concept of charge renormalization , we give an overview of the simulation details . in sec .",
    "[ sec : res]a we present our results for systems that consist of a pair of macroions , and in sec .",

    "in this section , we consider charged spherical macroions of diameter @xmath5 and positive charge @xmath6 ( here , @xmath7 is the elementary charge and @xmath2 the valency ) .",
    "they are immersed into a polar , structureless medium with dielectric constant @xmath8 .",
    "this medium is characterized by the bjerrum length @xmath9 , i.e.  the distance at which the electrostatic energy between two point charges equals the thermal energy @xmath10 .    in the dh limit",
    ", the interaction potential between two macroions , separated by a distance @xmath11 , is given by a screened coulomb ( yukawa ) potential @xcite , @xmath12 ^ 2         \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa r)}{r},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the screening parameter , @xmath14 represents the number of macroions , and @xmath15 is the number of added salt ion pairs . in eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) , it is assumed that the electrolyte solution is formed by monovalent microions in a system of total volume @xmath16 .",
    "the microions consist of @xmath17 negatively charged counterions that neutralize the charge of the macroions and @xmath18 salt ions , consisting half  and  half of counterions and oppositely charged coions .",
    "the inverse of the screening parameter , the so  called debye length @xmath19 , `` measures '' the thickness of the neutralizing counterion layer around the macroions .",
    "equation ( [ kappa ] ) shows that @xmath20 can be varied by changing the properties of the solvent , in particular the salt concentration .",
    "alexander _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that many charged colloidal systems with highly charged macroions can be described to some extent by a yukawa potential of the form of eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) , although the dh limit is restricted to particles with small charge .",
    "this is due to the fact that highly charged colloids have a strong tendency to form ordered structures at relatively low densities , i.e.  at densities where the mean distance between neighboring macroions is much larger than their size . in such systems ,",
    "each macroion has a very similar environment of microions , and thus a reasonable approximation is to reduce the problem of computing the effective many  particle interactions between macroions to that of determining a mean  field potential of one particle in its wigner  seitz ( ws ) cell surrounded by a reservoir of salt ions @xcite . for spherical macroions ,",

    "the microions are partially expelled .",

    "[ fig7 ] that the three - body interaction between the macroions yields attractive corrections to pairwise additivity . at small salt concentration , i.e.  if @xmath176 is significantly smaller than one for a given distance between the macroions , three - body corrections are most pronounced and they are weakly dependent on @xmath178 .",
    "but if @xmath176 reaches values that are of the order of one , the parameter @xmath174 increases rapidly and seems to vanish at high values of @xmath176 .",

    "solid lines have same meaning as in fig .  [ fig5 ] . [ fig9 ] ]    in the case of an equilateral triangle",
    ", the condition for three overlapping debye layers reads @xmath181 .",
    "using the same values of @xmath94 and @xmath11 for both geometries leads to @xmath182 , thus , in the triangular configuration , the debye layers exhibit a stronger overlap .    in fig .",

    "the strongest triplet interactions are revealed for case 1 .",
    "different from the coaxial geometry , the magnitude of the parameter @xmath174 increases with decreasing distance @xmath11 between the particles in the triangle .",
    "this can be easily understood since the interaction between the three macroions in the triangular geometry is not effectively screened by one of them but only by the microions in the debye layers . for case 1",
    "the magnitude of the parameter @xmath174 also seems to increase with increasing @xmath185 . up to now",
    ", we do not have an explanation for this behavior .    comparing case 2 and 3",
    ", we see that deviations from pairwise additivity are similar in both cases , and the overlap parameters @xmath186 and @xmath176 have comparable values . a similar feature has been found in a numerical solution of the nonlinear pb equation by russ",
    "_ et al . _",
    "these authors report that the three  body potential is independent of geometry if the sum over the distances between neighboring particles is constant .",
    "we would like to point out that there is always a trivial contribution to the many ",
    "body potential , which stems from an increased microion concentration associated with the addition of macroions .",
    "thus , for a fixed volume , the effective screening length of the system is decreased .",
    "a comparison between the measured three  body term , @xmath187 , and the two  body contribution , @xmath162 , taken from the pure two - macroion case should therefore in general yield a non  pairwise additivity . from that point of view , dh theory already predicts a correction to pairwise additivity .",
    "similar to the previous subsection , we calculate the angular resolved charge density distribution around the outermost macroion [ see eq .",
    "( [ rhominus.eq ] ) ] . in order to account for the differences between coaxial and triangular geometry",
    ", we introduce an angle @xmath188 , such that the system is symmetric around @xmath189 .",
    "thus , we have to choose @xmath190 for the coaxial geometry and @xmath191 for the equilateral triangle .    as fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows , the charge distribution for the three macroion case is not isotropic .",
    "compared to the case of two macroions , the internal energy of the system is now larger , and , therefore , entropic contributions might be less important . in accordance with our previous consideration , namely that an energetically unfavored microion distribution might lead to an additional repulsion between the macroions , we might conclude here that the onset of anisotropy is correlated with non  pairwise additivity .",
    "the choice of the same value of @xmath11 leads to a stronger anisotropy for the triangle as compared to the coaxial geometry , which is consistent with the behavior of the parameter @xmath174 ( see fig .  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "as done in the previous section , we compare our charge distribution to the one which follows from naive superposition of the dh distributions .",
    "surprisingly , for the three macroion configurations , this superposition seems to work very well .",
    "we performed classical md simulations in order to investigate effective interactions between isolated pairs and triples of charged macroions in the framework of the primitive model .    on the pair level , these interactions are surprisingly well described by the dh limit of the pb equation . in particular",
    "there is no evidence for charge renormalization as predicted by cell models .",
    "these models would predict an effective charge which is considerably smaller than the bare charge of the macroion  @xcite .",
    "this finding is not due to finite size effects in the simulation which might emerge if the debye length exceeds the size of the simulation box .",
    "it rather follows from the fact , that the cell model must not be applied to systems of isolated macroions .",
    "this means that the concept of charge renormalization might be relevant for bulk systems , but , in the case of systems of isolated macroions , simulations should be compared to direct solutions of the nonlinear pb equation .    in this work ,",
    "we have studied systems with small salt concentrations of the order of a few @xmath4mol , and we have considered configurations for which the debye layers of the different macroions exhibit a strong overlap .",
    "an interesting result of our simulations is the occurrence of repulsive corrections to dh theory : for the macroion pair , we find effective macroion charges that are slightly higher than their bare charge .",
    "similar results have been reported in previous work , e.g. , in an ab initio density functional theory approach @xcite , where the ratio between effective and bare charge was found to be between @xmath192 and @xmath193 , depending on salt concentration and the value of the bare charge .",
    "an `` repulsive correction to dh theory '' is also indicated by the isotropic charge distribution around the macroion in the case of the macroion pair .",
    "such an isotropic distribution is not expected from a naive superposition of one  particle density distributions as obtained from dh theory .",
    "hence , there seem to be less counterions between the macroions than expected from dh theory which can be related to an increase of the effective charge .",
    "the microscopic origin of this effect is not clear , but it might be of entropic origin .    in agreement with previous analytical @xcite , numerical @xcite and experimental studies@xcite of systems with three isolated macroions , we find that corrections to non  pairwise additivity ( and thus the three  body terms in the effective potential ) are attractive .",
    "the strength of these attractive contributions is strongly correlated with the overlap of all three debye layers .",
    "this shows that the concept of a screening length is also very useful to quantify the effect of three  body interactions .",
    "different from the case of two macroions , the charge distribution in the three ",
    "macroion case is anisotropic . in this case",
    ", the simple superposition of three one  particle density distributions from dh theory yields a rather good description of the charge distribution in the three  macroion case .",
    "this finding seems to agree with a recent numerical solution of the pb equation for three isolated macroions @xcite .    in further simulation studies",
    ", we will investigate interactions between more than three particles to understand the crossover to bulk effective interactions . in the latter case",
    ", the concept of charge renormalization seems to work very well .",
    "our present simulations suggest that many  body interactions in bulk systems yield renormalized charges that can be much smaller than the bare charges of charged colloidal particles",
