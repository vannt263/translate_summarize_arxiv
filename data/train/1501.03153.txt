    "understanding the nature of dark matter is one of the most pressing , unresolved problems in particle physics .",
    "dark matter is needed to understand structure formation , the observed galactic rotation curves  @xcite and the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the dark matter relic abundance is measured to be  @xcite @xmath3 a compelling argument for the origin of this abundance is to assume dark matter was once in thermal contact with the baryon - photon plasma during the early universe . since all known forms of matter in the universe were once in thermal equilibrium , this type of dark matter is theoretically persuasive . in this scenario ,",
    "the measured relic abundance is controlled by dark matter annihilations into standard model ( sm ) particles . because of constraints from the observed large scale structure in the universe , dark matter must be stable and non - relativistic ( cold ) when departing thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) alone can not account for the missing matter in the universe  @xcite .",
    "current experimental constraints , however , provide some guidance on the structure of the underlying theory . for example",
    ", the lack of large missing energy signatures at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite and other colliders  @xcite suggests that the dark matter is either heavy or has very small couplings with the sm so that it is not produced in high - energy collisions .",
    "additionally , direct detection experiments  @xcite , updated precision electroweak constraints , and precision z - pole experiments  @xcite all severely constrain the direct coupling of dark matter to the sm higgs and/or z  bosons .",
    "these constraints all imply that dark matter can not obtain all of its mass from the sm higgs alone  @xcite .",
    "mediator - facilitated interactions help to evade current experimental constraints by partially decoupling the dark matter from the sm . should these scenarios be realized in nature",
    ", the discovery of the mediator particles would be an important step in understanding the nature of dark matter .",
    "it is therefore crucial to place bounds on the masses and couplings of these mediators .",
    "the most popular ways for dark matter to annihilate via a mediator particle are through scalars that are colored or charged , the higgs boson  @xcite , or via a new neutral gauge boson .",
    "some of us explored the perturbative unitarity constraints on the higgs  @xcite and the gauge portals  @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on constraining scenarios where fermionic dark matter annihilates via charged or colored scalars . in supersymmetric ( susy ) models ,",
    "the charged and colored scalars are sleptons and squarks , respectively .",
    "we employ an effective field theory including these particles as a benchmark in our analysis .",
    "in addition , because of the intense focus on natural susy models , we particularly consider an effective field theory with dark matter and the supersymmetric partner of the top quark ( stop ) .",
    "the stop is the key for achieving natural , supersymmetric models of new physics .",
    "note naturalness  @xcite has been the dominant paradigm that has shaped models of new physics for the last 35 years .",
    "it is minimally satisfied with a relatively light stop  @xcite which cancels the quadratic divergences to the sm higgs mass from the top quark .",
    "moreover if the neutralino dark matter is only _ one component _ of the measured relic abundance ( e.g. , axionic plus neutralino dark matter ) , then the constraint on the stop mass improves .",
    "thus , our bounds may be useful in shaping viable r - parity conserving supersymmetric models .",
    "we apply unitarity constraints in a manner reminiscent of griest and kamiokowski  @xcite .",
    "however , there are important differences : here we focus on perturbative unitarity constraints which determine , in particular , when the dark matter couplings become strong .",
    "importantly , weakly interacting , massive dark matter and perturbativity have always had an intertwined conceptual association . in models that violate perturbative unitarity ,",
    "the elementary dark matter candidate is efficiently forming bound states as well as annihilating as the temperature decreases towards the thermal decoupling temperature .",
    "the annihilation diagrams for the elementary dark matter candidate can be easily altered ( and often times dressed with lighter states ) to form diagrams in which the bound state decays .",
    "the bound state will therefore have a lifetime much shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "thus , in models that violate perturbative unitarity , the elementary dark matter candidate is not an asymptotic state and the bound state that it forms is not a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "note , it is well known that viable dark matter candidates exist that are the result of strongly coupled or confining hidden sectors . however , in these models the dark matter annihilation processes are still perturbative  @xcite .",
    "we show our perturbative unitarity constraints are improved in comparison to the updated griest and kamiokowski bounds  @xcite .",
    "of central importance is the fact that our methodology places constraints on any particle associated with the dark matter annihilation .",
    "our bounds on the masses and couplings of the charged and colored scalars are novel .",
    "our basic perturbative unitarity arguments are straightforward .",
    "dark matter annihilating via the electrically charged and/or colored scalars does so via t - channel diagrams . as one increases the mass of the mediator , the annihilation cross section is diminished unless the yukawa coupling ( between the fermionic dark matter , sm fermions and mediators ) is raised .",
    "a sufficiently large annihilation cross section is needed to satisfy the relic abundance constraint .",
    "this process also forces the dark matter mass to be raised as well .",
    "eventually , the mediator mass is sufficiently large that the couplings violate perturbative unitarity therefore setting an upper bound on both the dark matter and mediator masses . the parameter space for this process is additionally constrained by requiring the dark matter relic abundance to be less than or equal to equation  .",
    "conversely , small mediator masses are constrained by collider searches and other measurements . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce simple models onto which we place our unitary and relic abundance bounds .",
    ".  introduces our unitarity constraints .",
    "section iv .",
    "computes the dark matter relic abundance and direct detection cross sections .",
    "section v.  describes existing experimental constraints from the lhc .",
    "we implement all of our constraints and perform a parameter scan in section vi .",
    "the basic unitarity bounds appear here .",
    "future experimental signatures are in section vii .",
    "conclusions and appendices follow .",
    "throughout we consider effective theories where the only relevant degrees of freedom are a sm singlet fermionic dark matter particle ( denoted by @xmath4 and potentially having either a dirac or majorana mass ) , a scalar mediator , and the sm particles .",
    "for this class of models , we consider scalar mediators that facilitates the following tree - level dm annihilation processes , @xmath5 through a yukawa - type coupling between the sm fermion @xmath6 , the dm particle @xmath4 , and the scalar mediator . as a result",
    ", @xmath6 must have the same sm quantum numbers as the scalar mediator . because we consider all possible sm final states , we consider scenarios with all possible sm quantum numbers for the scalar mediators . in order to stabilize the dm",
    ", both it and the scalar mediator must be charged under the same dark matter stabilization symmetry .",
    "because our scalar mediators are similar to the sfermions in susy models , we will therefore employ the susy nomenclature to describe them . however , the key difference with respect to susy theories is that we allow the dm - sfermion - fermion coupling to take an arbitrary value up to the perturbative limit .",
    "we consider an effective scenario in which the dm - sfermion - fermion coupling is the only non - gauge interaction for the sfermion  @xcite .",
    "the sfermions will either be purely left - handed , @xmath7 , or right - handed states @xmath8 .",
    "calling the dm - sfermion - fermion coupling @xmath9 , and considering a single set of sfermion quantum numbers , the interaction lagrangian is @xmath10 where @xmath11 and the field strength tensors for the gluon and photon are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . also , depending on the effective scenario the mediator lagrangian is @xmath14 where @xmath15 and the covariant derivative , @xmath16 , depends on the quantum numbers of @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "the potential is @xmath17 we remain agnostic about the mechanism that generates the @xmath4 mass and assume it can be integrated out . because we chose the yukawa - type coupling between the dark matter , mediator and fermion to be non - zero , our analysis is generic and the derived bounds subsequently weaker in comparison to  @xcite which considers only the qcd gauge coupling between those particles .",
    "once the quantum numbers of the sfermion are chosen , our scenario then has three basic independent parameters , @xmath18 these parameters are constrained by direct detection experiments , collider searches ( see the relevant direct detection and collider citations in the introduction ) and unitarity constraints .",
    "since we assume thermal dark matter and require @xmath4 to comprise some or all of the observed dm in the universe , our effective models are also constrained by the dm relic abundance .",
    "we consider scenarios with mediators that are color singlets as well as color triplets .",
    "the mediators may also be electroweak doublets as well .",
    "although the perturbative unitarity bounds do not depend on the sfermion quantum numbers , the effects of these quantum numbers on the relic density can be reproduced through the following rescaling @xmath19 where the rescaling factor @xmath20 depends on the representations of the groups @xmath21 is charged under .",
    "more details about how to compute @xmath20 are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec4 ] . here",
    "@xmath20 encodes the dimensions of the representations of the gauge group under which the mediator and sm fermions are charged .",
    "as @xmath20 is increased , in general larger dark matter and mediator masses are possible because the dark matter annihilation is more efficient .",
    "thus , there are weaker constraints from the relic abundance . as we show in section  [ sec : sec4 ] , our basic bounds scale accordingly .",
    "we briefly describe each scenario below .",
    "the colored mediators can have the quantum numbers @xmath22 we consider all three possible types of mediators separately and will call them @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively . in order to prevent flavor violation",
    ", we will consider the case in which these mediators are degenerate flavor triplets , @xmath26 with the dm - sfermion - fermion coupling matrix @xmath27 proportional to the identity matrix .",
    "the collider , relic and direct detection constraints ( but not the perturbative unitarity constraints ) have been previously studied in  @xcite . to make our work more comprehensive , in the appendix",
    "we modify the above scenario to allow for non - trivial couplings between the squark mediators and the sm higgs .",
    "these couplings are analogous to the a - terms in susy models .",
    "thus after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , left - right squark mixing is generated .",
    "we focus on a model with one left - handed squark doublet @xmath28 and one right - handed up - type squark @xmath24 , with the right - handed down - type squark @xmath25 decoupled . of note",
    ", this scenario has also been studied in the context of susy for the squark - mediated annihilation of bino - like dark matter  @xcite .      in this effective scenario , the color singlet mediators must have the quantum numbers @xmath29 we denote these mediators as @xmath30 and @xmath31 and call them sleptons .",
    "once again , we consider them in degenerate flavor triplets , @xmath32 with @xmath27 again proportional to the identity .",
    "the annihilation cross - section for color singlet mediators is decreased with respect to the colored mediator cross section .",
    "thus , the relic density will play a larger role in constraining this scenario .",
    "direct detection experiments will not be able to constrain this scenario at tree - level .",
    "natural susy requires , at minimum , a light stop to cancel the sm higgs mass quadratic divergences generated by sm top loops  @xcite .",
    "thus far , the lhc has not discovered the stop , and is setting increasingly stringent constraints on the stop mass  @xcite .",
    "thus , because of its significance to natural theories of new physics , we also consider the case where the right - handed ( rh ) stop , @xmath33 , is much lighter than the other squark flavors .",
    "although we only focus on light rh stop , models where only the left - handed ( lh ) stops is light should be constrained in a similar way .",
    "the lhc and , if necessary , a future hadronic collider is essential to discover / constrain this scenario .",
    "we consider an effective theory where a charged / colored scalar ( sfermion ) mediates dark matter annihilation .",
    "the only couplings allowed to vary freely are the dm - fermion - sfermion yukawa couplings , @xmath34 where @xmath15 from equation  .",
    "these couplings drive all the dm scattering and annihilation processes and are directly constrained by perturbative unitarity . as discussed in the introduction , there has been a long understood conceptual dependence of the wimp dark matter paradigm on perturbativity .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that any theory known to all orders in perturbation theory gives amplitudes which lie on the argand circle .",
    "however most perturbative unitarity computations are done at tree - level and the loop corrections push the value of the scattering amplitudes toward the argand circle . if the scattering amplitudes of some processes in the theory are too large at tree - level , unitarity can not be restored without violating perturbativity .",
    "@xcite have derived a simple geometric argument that allows the translation of a perturbativity bound into an upper bound on the tree - level scattering amplitudes in any theory .",
    "this upper bound applies to the eigenvalues of the partial wave components of the transition operator @xmath35 .",
    "this operator is defined such that @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the s - matrix . in this work ,",
    "we require that the loop contributions to the scattering amplitudes amount to less than @xmath38 of the tree - level values .",
    "according to  @xcite , this amounts to enforcing @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath41-th partial wave component of @xmath35 .",
    "since the lowest modes generally give the strongest constraints , we only focus on the s - wave component of @xmath35 ( @xmath42 ) . in the following , we derive unitarity bounds for the scattering of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 pairs where @xmath6 is any of the fermions associated to the scalars decribed in section  [ sec : sec2 ] .",
    "we compute the bounds in the large c.o.m .",
    "energy limit @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the electroweak vev .",
    "@xmath47 scattering is forbidden at tree level in our model . at the center of mass energies considered here ,",
    "both the electroweak and strong couplings can be neglected compared to @xmath27 .",
    "the amplitude associated to @xmath48 can therefore be neglected .",
    "we are thus left with only one process to consider , @xmath49 which is entirely determined by @xmath50 and/or @xmath51 .",
    "if the dm is a dirac particle , @xmath52 can only occur in the t - channel , through the diagram shown in figure  [ fig : dmunitarity ] . using the results quoted in @xcite ,",
    "the amplitude for this diagram in the large @xmath53 limit is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is either @xmath50 or @xmath51 , @xmath56 is the kronecker symbol and @xmath57 is the sign of the helicity of a given fermion @xmath6 . here ,",
    "in the large @xmath53 limit , we denote the helicity of the lh fermions as @xmath58 and the one of the rh fermions as @xmath59 .",
    "since we work at large @xmath53 , we can operate in the interaction eigenstate basis . for generic sfermions @xmath60",

    "these diagrams interfere constructively and the resulting amplitude is doubled with respect to the dirac case .",
    "the bounds quoted above then become @xmath67     diagrams contributing to the @xmath52 amplitude for dirac and majorana dm .",

    "for dirac dm , annihilation occurs dominantly in the s - wave , with the s - wave term @xmath69 being @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the color factor .",
    "when the dm and sfermion masses increase , the coupling @xmath27 also needs to increase to ensure efficient dm annihilation , unless the dm and sfermion masses are nearly degenerate .",
    "the coannihilation region , where the dm and mediator masses are within a few percent of each other , is however extremely narrow and can only be obtained at the price of a significant fine - tuning . throughout this paper",

    "the s - wave component of the dm annihilation cross section is bounded by @xmath73 in a perturbative theory , unitarity sets an upper bound on @xmath27 , as studied in section  [ sec : sec3 ] .",
    "when @xmath27 reaches its maximum value , @xmath74 will decrease as the dark matter mass increases .",

    "a similar reasoning leads to a neighboring upper bound on the mediator masses .",
    "a similar mechanism is at play for majorana dm . in this case , however , dm annihilates through both the @xmath68 and the @xmath77-channels , as shown in figure  [ fig : dmunitarity ] .",
    "the two corresponding diagrams interfere destructively .",
    "the s - wave component of the dm annihilation cross section to two fermions @xmath6 is therefore suppressed by a factor of @xmath78 .",
    "heavy dm annihilation then occurs mostly in the p - wave @xcite . as computed in @xcite , the annihilation cross section for majorana dm goes as @xmath79 in the early universe , the velocity suppressed p - wave term dominates and , for degenerate sfermion masses , all the dm annihilation channels contribute equally to the relic density .",
    "this cross section is in general much smaller than the annihilation cross section for dirac dm . outside the coannihilation region , the relic density constraints on majorana dm",

    ", we consider various possible sfermion configurations , notably , degenerate sfermion flavor triplets and models where the stop is much lighter than the other new particles . for dirac dm",
    ", the upper bounds on the dm and sfermion masses vary between about @xmath105 tev for stops and right - handed sleptons to @xmath115 tev for left - handed squark doublets outside the coannihilation region . the bounds for majorana dm are much tighter , varying from @xmath106 tev for stops and right - handed sleptons to about @xmath100 tev for left - handed squark doublets .",
    "we also consider co - annihilation regions , in which the griest and kamionkowski bound does not apply . in these regions ,",

    "the upper bounds derived in this work strongly depend on the number of scalar mediators driving the dm annihilation .",
    "this work , however , spans a wide range of possible configurations and , within the mfv framework , can be readily adapted to models involving different combinations of sfermions .",
    "exploiting the tension between unitarity and relic density constraints on dm and sfermions not only allows us to derive upper bounds on the scales of new physics , but also to define goals for future experiments . for dirac dm ,",
    "in particular , future direct detection experiments such as xenon1 t could probe most of the parameter space in models with light - flavor squarks , leaving only extremely narrow regions viable . for majorana dm or models with stops or sleptons ,",
    "however , collider searches and indirect detection will provide the best constraints on new physics .",
    "for majorana dm , which is associated with particularly tight bounds , a future @xmath117 collider would be able to probe most of the parameter space for squark models .",
    "since relic density constraints require the dm and sfermion masses to be close to each other , however , developing and improving compressed spectrum searches will be crucial to get a better understanding of scalar mediator models .",

    "if we allow for a non - trivial coupling between the sfermion mediators and the sm higgs that is analogous to the a - terms in susy , we can generate left - right ( l - r ) mixing after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "this can be important for models with flavor triplet squarks and majorana dm . in this case , the spin - independent direct detection cross section is suppressed due to its twist-2 origin .",
    "the direct detection constraints could in principle become stronger if the left and right - handed squarks are allowed to mix .",
    "this scenario has been most recently studied in the context of susy for sneutrino - mediated dm annihilation  @xcite . to explore this possibility",
    ", we consider a model with one left - handed squark doublet @xmath23 and one right - handed up - type squark @xmath83 , with the right - handed down - type squark @xmath84 decoupled .",
    "since mixing between different squark flavors is strongly constrained by kaon oscillations @xcite , we only allow mixing between left and right - handed squarks of the same flavor .",
    "such a scenario can be obtained naturally by requiring the minimum flavor violation ( mfv )  @xcite , and requiring the left - right squark mixing terms in the lagrangian to be proportional to the masses of the corresponding quarks .",

    "<S> dark matter that was once in thermal equilibrium with the standard model is generally prohibited from obtaining all of its mass from the electroweak or qcd phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a new scale of physics and mediator particles needed to facilitate dark matter annihilations . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we consider scenarios where thermal dark matter annihilates via scalar mediators that are colored and/or electrically charged . </S>",
    "<S> we show how partial wave unitarity places upper bounds on the masses and couplings on both the dark matter and mediators . to do this , we employ effective field theories with dark matter as well as three flavors of sleptons or squarks with minimum flavor violation . for dirac ( majorana ) dark matter that annihilates via mediators charged as left - handed sleptons , we find an upper bound around @xmath0  tev ( @xmath1  tev ) for both the mediator and dark matter masses , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these bounds vary as the square root of the number of colors times the number of flavors involved . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the bounds diminish by root two for right handed selectrons . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds increase by root three and root six for right and left handed squarks , respectively . finally , because of the interest in natural models , we also focus on an effective field theory with only stops . </S>",
    "<S> we find an upper bound around @xmath2 tev ( 5 tev ) for both the dirac ( majorana ) dark matter and stop masses . in comparison to traditional naturalness arguments , the stop bound gives a firmer , alternative expectation on when new physics will appear . </S>",
    "<S> similar to naturalness , all of the bounds quoted above are valid outside of a defined fine - tuned regions where the dark matter can co - annihilate . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds in this region of parameter space can exceed the well - known bounds from griest and kamionkowski  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly describe the impact on planned and existing direct detection experiments and colliders . </S>"
