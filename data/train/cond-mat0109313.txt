    "the techniques developed in statistical physics , particularly in the theory of spin glasses , have been recently applied to a variety of problems in theoretical computer science@xcite .",
    "these include various optimization problems such as the traveling salesman problem@xcite , graph partitioning@xcite , satisfiability problems@xcite , the knapsack problem@xcite , the vertex covering problem@xcite , error correcting codes@xcite , number partitioning problems@xcite , matching problems@xcite and many others@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study analytically certain problems in a different area of theoretical computer science known as sorting and searching@xcite .",
    "the standard techniques of spin glass theory are not directly suitable for these problems .",
    "instead , we employ the techniques developed to study the propagation of traveling fronts in various nonlinear systems @xcite",
    ".    the `` sorting and searching '' is an important area of computer science that deals with the following basic question : how to organize or sort out the incoming data so that the computer takes the minimum time to search for a given data if required later ? amongst various search algorithms ,",
    "the binary search turns out to be one of the most efficient@xcite . to understand this algorithm ,",
    "let us start with a simple example .",
    "suppose the incoming data string consists of the twelve months of the year appearing in the following order : july , september , december , may , april , february , january , october , november , march , june and august .",
    "suppose later we need to look for the month of august in this data string .",
    "consider first the sequential search where the computer starts from the first element ( july ) , checks if it is the right month and if not , moves to the next element of the string ( september ) , checks the element there and continues in this fashion until it finds the right month .",
    "in the example above , to find the month ` august ' , the computer has to make 12 comparisons .",
    "thus , the sequential search algorithm is rather inefficient as it typically takes a search time of order @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is the number of entries in the data string .    in a binary search ,",
    "on the other hand , the typical search time scales as @xmath2@xcite . the binary search is implemented by organizing the data string on a tree according to the following algorithm .",
    "an order is first chosen for the incoming data , e.g. , it can be alphabetical or chronological ( january , february , march , etc . ) .",
    "let us choose the chronological order .",
    "now the first element of the input string ( july ) is put at the root of a tree ( see fig .",
    "the next element of the string is september .",
    "one compares with the root element ( july ) and sees that september is bigger than july ( in chronological order ) .",
    "so one assigns september to a daughter node of the root in the right branch . on the other hand ,",
    "if the new element ware less than the root , it would have gone to the daughter node of the left branch .",
    "then the next element is december .",
    "we compare at the root ( july ) and decide that it has to go to the right , then we compare with the existing right daughter node ( september ) and decide that december has to go to the node which is the right daughter of september .",
    "the process continues till all the elements are assigned their nodes on the tree . for the particular data string in the above example , we finally get the unique tree as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "such a tree is called a binary search tree ( bst ) .",
    "once this tree is constructed , the subsequent search , say for the month of august , takes much less number of comparisons .",
    "we start with the root ( july ) . since the sought after element august is bigger than july , we know that it must be on the right branch of the two daughter sub - trees .",
    "this already eliminates searching roughly half of elements which are on the left sub - tree .",
    "we next encounter the key september . since august is less than september , we go to the left and thus we do not need to search anymore the right branch of the sub - tree rooted at september . once we go to the left , we find the required key august .",
    "thus , the bst algorithm requires only 3 comparisons as opposed to 12 operations in the sequential search . since the typical search time is proportional to the depth of an element in the tree and since the typical depth @xmath3 is related to the total size @xmath1 via @xmath4 , the search time scales as @xmath2 , making the bst algorithm one of the most efficient search algorithms .",
    "if the incoming data string had a different order of appearance , one would have obtained a different bst .",
    "for example , suppose the months appear in a different order as : may , november , august , april , december , february , june , september , july , january , october and march .",
    "for this data string , the same algorithm of constructing a binary tree as before gives a tree of different shape ( fig .",
    "each permutation of the incoming data string leads to a different binary tree and there are @xmath5 possible binary trees for any incoming data string with @xmath1 entries .",
    "usually the incoming data string appears in a random fashion .",
    "this would indicate that each of the @xmath5 possible binary trees occurs with equal probability .",
    "such trees , each generated with equal probability , are called ` random binary search trees ' ( rbst ) . of course",
    ", if the incoming data is not completely random , the probability measure over the space of trees will not be uniform .",
    "the results derived in this paper will be applicable not only to rbst but also to more general bst s with arbitrary measure .",
    "each bst has several observables ( such as the depth or the height of a tree ) associated with it that quantify the efficiency of the underlying search algorithm .",
    "hence the knowledge of the statistics of such observables are of central importance . here",
    "are a few observables :    @xmath6 @xmath7 is the depth ( distance from the root ) of the last inserted element in a given bst of size @xmath1 .",
    "for example , @xmath8 for the tree in fig .  1 ( counting the depth of the root element as @xmath9 ) .",
    "each bst has a different @xmath7 , so @xmath7 is a random variable",
    ". the average depth @xmath10 ( averaged over the probability measure of the trees ) gives a measure of the average time required to insert a new element in a tree@xcite .",
    "@xmath6 @xmath11 is the height of a given tree , defined as the depth of the farthest node from the root .",
    "for example , @xmath12 for the bst in fig .  1 .",
    "clearly @xmath11 is also a random variable and @xmath13 gives a measure of the _ maximum _ possible time that could be required to insert an element , i.e. a measure of the _ worst _ case scenario@xcite .",
    "@xmath6 @xmath14 is the balanced height defined as the _ maximum _ depth from the root up to which the tree is _ fully _ balanced ,",
    "i.e. , all the nodes up to this depth are fully occupied@xcite . in the tree shown in fig .  1 , @xmath15 , whereas @xmath16 in the tree in fig",
    "hence @xmath14 is also a random variable whose statistics is important .",
    "some of the observables mentioned above such as the height @xmath11 and the balanced height @xmath14 are of extremal nature , i.e. , they are the maximum or the minimum of a set of _ correlated _ random variables . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves only to such extreme observables of the binary tree .",
    "while the statistics of the extremum of a set of _ uncorrelated _ random variables is well understood@xcite , little is known about the same for correlated variables@xcite . however , in the present problem the random variables are correlated in a special hierarchical way which facilitates analysis .",
    "we will see that the extreme variables in the bst problem satisfy nonlinear recursion relations that admit traveling front solutions in some suitable variables .",
    "a lot is known about the speed and the shape of such fronts appearing in various nonlinear systems@xcite .",
    "below , we will use these techniques to study the statistics of extreme variables in the binary tree problem .",
    "some of our results for the rbst were already known which we will mention as we go along .",
    "however , the approach used here is quite different from those used by the computer scientists .",
    "computer scientists tend to establish upper and lower bounds to the quantity of interest ( typically the average value or the variance of the observable ) and then tighten the bounds@xcite . if the bounds coincide , one obtains an exact result@xcite .",
    "our approach , on the other hand , is a typical physicist s approach .",
    "the methods we use may not always be rigorous in the strict mathematical sense , but they lead to exact asymptotic results in a physically transparent way .",
    "moreover , our approach allows us not only to reproduce already known asymptotics for the average height and the average balanced height of the rbst , but also to obtain new information about the variance and even the asymptotic shapes of the full probability distributions .",
    "besides , our method goes beyond the rbst and yields exact results for trees generated with arbitrary distributions .",
    "our approach utilizes two exact mappings which can be summarized as follows .",
    "following devroye@xcite , we first map the rbst problem to a random fragmentation problem where an object of initial length @xmath1 breaks randomly into two fragments , each of which further breaks randomly into two parts , and so on .",
    "the fragmentation problem is interesting on its own right as it appears in the context of various physical problems such as the energy cascades in turbulence@xcite , rapture processes in earthquakes@xcite , financial crashes in stock markets@xcite , and the stress propagation in granular medium@xcite .",
    "some of the extremal problems in the random fragmentation problem were studied recently by hattori and ochiai@xcite and by us@xcite . the method used in our previous short paper@xcite allowed us to obtain exact asymptotic results for the average of the maximal piece of the @xmath17 fragments after @xmath18 iterations .",
    "the statistics of this maximal piece is closely related to the statistics of the height in the rbst .",
    "however , this method was not easy to extend to the cases beyond the random fragmentation , i.e. when the break point is chosen from an arbitrary distribution , not necessarily uniform .",
    "we will see later that a fragmentation problem with a given break point distribution corresponds to a bst problem where the incoming entries to the tree appear according to a specific distribution and not just randomly .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the fragmentation problem , with arbitrary break point distribution , can further be mapped onto a modified directed polymer ( mdp ) problem on a cayley tree .",
    "the mdp problem differs from the conventional directed polymer ( dp ) problem on a cayley tree studied by derrida and spohn@xcite due to the presence of a special constraint in the mdp .",
    "derrida and spohn were mostly interested in the finite temperature spin glass transition in the dp problem .",
    "our problem reduces to a zero temperature problem , albeit with a special constraint .",
    "we then solve this mdp problem using traveling front techniques and translate back to derive exact asymptotic results for the original bst problem .",
    "we will see that the statistics of the height @xmath11 of the bst problem is related ( via the two successive mappings ) to the statistics of the minimum or the ground state energy of the mdp problem . on the other hand",
    ", the statistics of the balanced height @xmath14 will be related to that of the maximum energy of the directed polymer ( a quantity of little interest in statistical physics framework ) .",
    "this second mapping also allows us to obtain new exact results for nonrandom bst problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "i , we set up notation , review known results for the rbst problem , and summarize novel results obtained in this paper .",
    "section ii contains the exact mapping of the bst problem to the fragmentation problem . in sect .",
    "iii , we map the fragmentation problem to the mdp problem . in sect .",
    "iv , we derive the exact nonlinear recursion relations in the mdp problem and analyze them using the traveling front techniques .",
    "the main results for the rbst problem are also derived in this section . in sect .",
    "v , we go beyond the random trees and derive exact results for the fragmentation problem with arbitrary break point distribution .",
    "section vi contains the generalization to the case of @xmath0-ary trees with arbitrary distributions .",
    "we finally conclude in sect .",
    "vii with a summary and outlook .",
    "let us label the incoming data string of @xmath1 elements by integers @xmath9 , @xmath19 , @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if the data string consists of the @xmath20 months of the year , we can label , say the month of january by @xmath9 , the month of february by @xmath21 , and so on . in that example , @xmath22",
    ". a specific data string will then be isomorphic to a corresponding ordered sequence of these integers .",
    "for example , the particular sequence of months in fig .  1 reduces to the ordered sequence @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "a different sequence of months will correspond to a different permutation of these integers .",
    "each such sequence or permutation will then correspond to a separate bst , constructed by the algorithm explained in the introduction . in rbst , all these @xmath5 sequences ( and their corresponding trees ) occur with equal probability .",
    "we will focus on the statistics of the extreme variables associated with these trees , in particular the height @xmath11 and the balanced height @xmath14 of a bst as defined in the introduction .",
    "each bst has a unique value of @xmath11 and @xmath14 .",
    "since the trees occur with a given probability distribution ( which is uniform in case of rbst ) , both @xmath11 and @xmath14 are random variables .",
    "of interest are the statistics of these variables such as the average , variance or even the full probability distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath14 .",
    "the rbst problem has been studied for a long time by computer scientists and we now mention a few known results .",
    "devroye@xcite proved that for large @xmath1 , the average height of a rbst @xmath24 where the constant @xmath25 .",
    "hattori and ochiai conjectured that the true asymptotic behavior of @xmath13 has an additional sub - leading double logarithmic correction , @xmath26 and they determined the constant @xmath27 numerically@xcite . using traveling front techniques we confirmed the above asymptotics and computed the correction term analytically , @xmath28=-1.95303\\dots$ ] @xcite .",
    "the same result was simultaneously proved by reed@xcite . based on numerical data , robson conjectured@xcite",
    "that the variance is bounded .",
    "recently , drmota@xcite has proved that all moments @xmath29 are bounded .    for the balanced height @xmath14 of rbst",
    ", devroye showed that the leading asymptotic behavior of the average balanced height is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31@xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath32 in @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath35 turn out to be the two solutions of the same transcendental equation @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this suggests some kind of duality between the height and the balanced height .",
    "we will show later that the correct asymptotic behavior of @xmath35 is given by @xmath37 where relation @xmath38 $ ] holds again .",
    "drmota has recently proved that all the moments of @xmath14 are also bounded@xcite as in the case of @xmath11 .",
    "note that all the results mentioned above are for rbst with fixed size @xmath1 .",
    "recently by using a rate equation approach we studied the statistics of height and balanced height for randomly growing binary trees where the average size of a tree grows with time linearly @xmath39@xcite . the expected height and balanced height for large random binary trees were found to have exactly the same asymptotic formulas ( [ hn1])([hn1 ] ) , provided one replaces @xmath1 by @xmath40 in these equations .",
    "this approach is thus reminiscent of the grand canonical approach in statistical mechanics with the time @xmath41 playing the role of the chemical potential which can be chosen to fix the average size . in this paper , we focus only on the canonical approach , i.e. , trees with fixed given size @xmath1 , since this is more familiar in theoretical computer science .",
    "we will exploit a two stage mapping `` bst problem @xmath42 fragmentation problem @xmath42 mdp problem '' and use the traveling front technique to analyze the mdp problem .",
    "this technique allows to re - derive in a physically transparent way all results for the rbst mentioned above and provides a lot of new results .",
    "we will show that the constants @xmath32 and @xmath34 are simply related to the velocities of traveling fronts .",
    "the sub - leading correction terms can also be derived analytically .",
    "the traveling front approach also predicts ` concentration of measure ' of the variables @xmath11 and @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the asymptotic probability distributions of these variables are highly localized around their respective averages . as a result ,",
    "a typical value of @xmath43 and the spread in @xmath11 is of order @xmath44 in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "naturally the variance and higher cumulants of both @xmath11 and @xmath14 are bounded .",
    "we also derive an asymptotically exact nonlinear integral equation for the full probability distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath14 .",
    "while we could not solve this nonlinear equation in closed form , we could derive the behaviors at the tails of these highly localized distribution functions .",
    "we will also see that within this approach the variables @xmath11 and @xmath14 map respectively onto the minimum and maximum energy of a directed polymer and hence the observed duality between them is rather natural .",
    "the main advantage of the present approach is that it allows us to go beyond the random trees and obtain exact asymptotic results for the statistics of @xmath11 and @xmath14 for bst s with arbitrary distributions .",
    "this is the main new result of the present paper .",
    "besides , we also generalize basic results to @xmath0-ary search trees with arbitrary distributions .",
    "in order to derive the asymptotics of the statistics of the height and the balanced height in the bst problem , it is convenient to first map this problem to a fragmentation problem following devroye@xcite . to illustrate how this mapping works ,",
    "let us consider again the example in fig .  1 where the months ( or the corresponding integers from @xmath9 to @xmath20 ) appear in the particular sequence @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the first element ( which in this example is @xmath45 ) is chosen randomly from the available @xmath22 elements in the case of rbst .",
    "once this element is chosen , the remaining elements will belong either to the interval @xmath46 $ ] or @xmath47 $ ] , which are subsequently completely disconnected from each other . thus choosing the first element is equivalent to breaking the original interval @xmath48 $ ] into two intervals , the left @xmath46 $ ] and the right @xmath47 $ ] at the break point @xmath45 which is chosen randomly .",
    "now consider the next element .",
    "it will either belong to the left or the right interval . in the particular example we are discussing",
    ", the next element @xmath49 belongs to the right interval @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "this new element then divides the right interval @xmath47 $ ] again into two parts : the left containing only the single element @xmath50 $ ] and the right @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "these two new intervals subsequently become completely independent of each other .",
    "the third element @xmath52 $ ] breaks subsequently the interval @xmath51 $ ] into two parts : the left part @xmath53 $ ] and the right part which is empty .",
    "similarly the fourth element @xmath54 $ ] breaks the interval @xmath46 $ ] into two parts : the left part @xmath55 $ ] and the right part @xmath56 $ ] and so on .",
    "thus one can think of the construction of the rbst as a dynamical fragmentation process where one starts with a stick of initial length @xmath1 and breaks it randomly into two parts : a left part of length @xmath57 and a right part of length @xmath58 with the constraint @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a random number distributed uniformly over the interval @xmath61 $ ] . at the next step ,",
    "one breaks each of these intervals again into two parts . at any stage of breaking",
    ", the random variable @xmath60 characterizing the break point of an interval is chosen independently from interval to interval .",
    "they are also independent from stage to stage .",
    "after @xmath18 steps of breaking , there are @xmath17 intervals .",
    "note that this fragmentation process has itself a tree structure and can be represented by a branching process as depicted in fig .",
    "a search tree of fixed size @xmath1 is completed when in the corresponding fragmentation process , the lengths of all intervals are less than @xmath9 because this means that all the elements of the incoming data string have already been incorporated onto the search tree .",
    "although in the fragmentation problem we have continuous intervals whereas in the rbst the intervals consist of discrete integers , it does not really matter since one can associate the integer part of a break point to a particular integer element of the rbst .",
    "for example , if the first break point in the fragmentation problem is @xmath62 , this means that in the rbst problem , the first element ( the root ) is integer @xmath45 .",
    "let us first consider the height @xmath11 of the rbst . by definition , @xmath11 is the distance from the root ( depth ) of the farthest element in the rbst .",
    "the rbst stops growing beyond @xmath11 as all the incoming @xmath1 elements have been incorporated in the tree .",
    "thus when the rbst attains the depth @xmath11 , in the corresponding fragmentation problem , the length of every interval is less than @xmath9 .",
    "denote by @xmath63 , @xmath19 , @xmath64 the lengths of @xmath17 intervals after @xmath18 steps of breaking . clearly , the probability @xmath65 $ ] in the rbst problem is the same as the probability that all @xmath17 intervals in the fragmentation problem have lengths less than @xmath9 , @xmath66={\\rm prob}\\left[l_1<1,\\ldots,\\l_{2^n}<1\\right ] .",
    "\\label{probh}\\ ] ] the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ probh ] ) is also the probability that the maximum of the lengths of the @xmath17 pieces is less than @xmath9 in the fragmentation problem .",
    "we next consider the balanced height @xmath14 of the rbst . by definition",
    ", @xmath14 is the depth up to which the rbst is fully saturated and balanced . beyond this depth",
    ", some parts of the rbst stop growing ( see fig .  1 where @xmath15 ) .",
    "this means that in the corresponding random fragmentation process , as long as the step number of breaking is less than @xmath14 , the lengths of all the intervals must still be bigger than @xmath9 , so that each such interval can incorporate a new element .",
    "thus the probability @xmath67 $ ] in the rbst is the same as the probability that all @xmath17 intervals in the fragmentation problem have lengths bigger than @xmath9 , @xmath68={\\rm    prob}\\left[l_1>1 , \\ldots,\\l_{2^n}>1\\right ] .",

    "( [ probh ] ) is also the probability that the minimum of the lengths of the @xmath17 pieces is bigger than @xmath9 in the fragmentation problem .    in the rbst ,",
    "the new elements in the tree arrive randomly .",
    "the corresponding fragmentation problem is also random in the sense that at each stage an interval @xmath69 is broken into two parts of lengths @xmath70 and @xmath71 with @xmath59 where the random variable @xmath60 is chosen each time independently and is distributed uniformly over @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "one can , of course , generalize this random fragmentation problem where the variable @xmath60 is chosen independently each time but with an arbitrary distribution over @xmath61 $ ] , not necessarily uniform .",
    "this would correspond to a bst problem where the new elements arrive with a specified distribution .",
    "in general , at any stage of breaking , the joint probability distribution of @xmath60 and @xmath72 can be written as @xmath73= \\phi(r ) \\phi(r ' ) \\delta(r+r'-1 ) .",
    "\\label{jointr}\\ ] ] the delta function ensures that the total length is conserved at every stage of breaking .",

    "the function @xmath75 must be chosen such that the induced distribution @xmath76 satisfies the conditions , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "both these methods work well for the random problem ( where @xmath81 ) but seem difficult to extend to the general case when the break point in the fragmentation process is chosen from an arbitrary induced distribution @xmath76@xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that the fragmentation problem with general @xmath76 can further be mapped to a mdp problem as presented in the next section .",
    "this further mapping followed by the traveling front analysis then allows us to obtain exact asymptotic results for the general case with arbitrary @xmath76 .",
    "in this section we further map the fragmentation problem onto a mdp problem on a cayley tree .",
    "this mdp problem turns out to be slightly different from the conventional dp problem studied in statistical mechanics due to the presence of a special constraint . nevertheless , asymptotic properties in the mdp problem can be derived analytically using the traveling front techniques .    to understand this mapping ,",

    "( [ prodl ] ) , we see that the total energy @xmath93 of a path ( starting at the root and ending at the @xmath86-interval at the stage @xmath18 ) becomes @xmath94 this path then represents a typical configuration of a directed polymer ( directed in the downward direction ) with energy given by eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) where @xmath92 s are random bond energies .",
