    "among various approaches to the unification of general relativity and quantum physics the loop quantum gravity @xcite is one of the most promising .",
    "its symmetry reduced version , loop quantum cosmology @xcite , offers a qualitatively new picture of an early universe evolution @xcite and may provide a mechanism of solving long standing problems in modern cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , although the number of works using the heuristic methods of mimicking the quantum evolution by an appropriately constructed classical mechanics @xcite is rapidly growing , not so much effort has been dedicated so far to the investigation on a genuinely quantum level .",
    "the rigorous studies of these aspects are in fact restricted just to models either in vacuo @xcite , or admitting massless scalar field as the only matter content @xcite .",
    "the number of works attempting to include the cosmological constant @xmath4 is even smaller @xcite and the rigorous analysis of the quantum universe dynamics within precise lqc model @xcite was done only for negative @xmath4 , a case not favored by the observations .",
    "this article is an attempt to partially fill this gap , by addressing the question whether , in presence of the _ positive _ cosmological constant , the physical evolution defined by the methods currently applied in lqc @xcite is unique .",
    "there , one treats the constrained system as a free one , evolving with respect to the scalar field regarded as an internal time .",
    "the evolution is generated by a so called evolution operator ( further denoted as @xmath5 ) .",
    "on the technical level the definiteness and uniqueness of the evolution reduces to the existence and the uniqueness of the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath5 . in the previously investigated models this operator always admitted a unique extension @xcite , which ensured a unique evolution .",
    "the positive @xmath4 however acts like a negative unbounded potential , thus one can not immediately expect the same answer for the models with @xmath1 . here",
    "we analyze in detail the self - adjointness of @xmath5 , showing in particular , that for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a certain critical value ( of the planck order ) it in fact admits a family of extensions .",
    "this property is crucial for further studies of the universe dynamics @xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : frame ] we briefly recall the basic features of the model and introduce the elements relevant for our investigation .",

    "its classical and kinematical description ( in a loop quantization ) is a direct analogy of the one used for the model with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the considered spacetime admits a foliation ( parametrized by a time @xmath10 ) by isotropic @xmath11-surfaces @xmath12 and the metric @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a unit ( fiducial ) cartesian metric on the surface @xmath12 , @xmath15 is a lapse function and @xmath16 is a scale factor . to describe the spacetime we use the canonical formalism , first selecting the fiducial triad @xmath17 orthonormal with respect to @xmath14 ( and the cotriad @xmath18 dual to it ) , next introducing the canonical ashtekar variables : connections @xmath19 and triads @xmath20 , which upon partial fixing of the gauge freedom can be represented just by a pair of canonically conjugated variables : the connection @xmath21 and triad @xmath22 coefficients ,    [ eq : ae - def]@xmath23    where @xmath24 is the fiducial ( with respect to @xmath14 ) volume of a certain comoving cubical region @xmath25 introduced to regulate the divergences of the action and the hamiltonian .",
    "the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 are global degrees of freedom .",
    "our system is a constrained one , with the diffeomorphism and gauss constraints automatically satisfied by a gauge choice .",

    "next the constraint is promoted to a quantum operator @xmath35 defined in some domain of the kinematical hilbert space @xmath36 identified in the previous step , and @xmath37 the physical hilbert space @xmath38 is built out of the states annihilated by it .",
    "finally @xmath39 the evolution picture is provided by selecting an internal time ( in our case this role is played by @xmath32 ) and defining the family of observables parametrized by it . in a slightly weaker sense , the evolution is defined by the unitary mapping between the spaces of `` initial data '' . in the cases considered here",
    "it corresponds to a map @xmath40 our goal here is the verification of the existence and uniqueness of such mapping .",
    "the particular realization and the results of each of theses steps is the following :    @xmath33 to assess the geometry degrees of freedom we construct the analog of an lqg holonomy - flux algebra consisting of the holonomies along the straight lines and fluxes along the unit square surfaces , then proceed with the quantization method used for lqg .",
    "the resulting kinematical gravitational hilbert space is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a bohr compactification of the real line .",
    "the basic operators are holonomies @xmath43 and unit fluxes ( or `` triads '' ) @xmath44 .",
    "a particularly convenient basis of @xmath45 consists of the eigenstates of @xmath44 labeled by @xmath46 as follows @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the lqc _ area gap _ @xcite . in this basis",
    "the scalar product is given by @xmath49    the matter degrees of freedom are quantized via standard methods of quantum mechanics .",

    "we study three of them introduced in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and denoted respectively by aps , slqc and mmo prescriptions . in all of these cases the quantum constraint",

    "@xmath37 given the constraint operator in the form one can find the physical hilbert space for example by the group averaging techniques @xcite .",
    "for that however one needs to know the spectral decomposition of @xmath0 , thus its self - adjoint extension(s ) .    before going to this step",
    "let us note , that the structure of @xmath0 and provides the natural division of the domain of @xmath63 onto the subsets ( the _ lattices _ ) @xmath64 preserved by the action of @xmath0 .",
    "this division is naturally transferred to the splitting of @xmath38 onto superselection sectors . in consequence",
    "it is enough to fix a particular value of @xmath65 and work just with the restriction of the domain of @xmath0 to functions supported on @xmath66 only .",
    "further restriction comes from the fact that the considered system does not admit parity violating interactions . in consequence",
    "the triad orientation reflection @xmath67 , being a large gauge symmetry , provides another natural division onto superselection sectors , namely the spaces of symmetric and antisymmetric states . for the rest of this work we select the sector corresponding to symmetric states with @xmath62 .",
    "the studies are however straightforward extendable to all other sectors , as we discuss at the end of each section .",
    "our particular choice allows to further restrict the support of the functions to @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath39 a form of finding the physical hilbert space and defining an evolution alternative to group averaging ( and for the form of the constraint , equivalent to it @xcite ) is a reinterpretation of the system as a free one evolving along the scalar field playing the role of an internal time .",
    "the similarity of with the klein - gordon equation @xmath69(v,\\phi ) = -[\\theta_{\\lambda}\\psi](v,\\phi)\\ ] ] allows one to directly apply the standard quantum mechanical methods for solving it .",
    "such structure in particular introduces yet another splitting onto superselection sectors corresponding to positive and negative energies out of which we select the positive sector . in consequence",
    "we can immediately write down the evolution between the initial data states on the constancy surfaces of @xmath32 , belonging to the projection of @xmath45 onto the space spanned by the positive part of the spectrum of @xmath0 @xmath70(v,\\phi ) & = e^{i(\\phi-\\phi_o)\\sqrt{\\theta_{\\lambda}}_{+ } } \\psi(v,\\phi_o ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath71 is the projection onto positive part of the spectrum and @xmath72 is the square root of @xmath0 on the space @xmath73 .",
    "for the evolution to be well - defined and unitary however the operator @xmath0 needs to be self - adjoint .",
    "thus , the problem of the definiteness of the evolution reduces to the question about the self - adjointness of @xmath0 , which we will investigate in the next section .",
    "to start with , we note that the operator @xmath0 defined via and is symmetric on the domain @xmath74 of the finite linear combinations of eigenstates @xmath75 of @xmath44 , a set which is itself dense in @xmath45 . to check whether @xmath0 is furthermore essentially self - adjoint we follow the method specified in @xcite : finding its deficiency indexes .",
    "the first step is the identification of the deficiency subspaces @xmath76 defined as the spaces of ( kinematically ) normalizable solutions @xmath77 to the equation @xmath78(v ) = \\pm i\\psi^{\\pm}(v ) .\\ ] ] the dimensions of @xmath76 are exactly the deficiency indexes needed to verify the self - adjointness . by inspecting the form of @xmath0 provided in - and taking into account the symmetry , we note that any solution @xmath77 to is uniquely determined via its value @xmath79 .",
    "the spaces @xmath76 are thus at most @xmath80-dimensional and nontrivial only when the solutions are normalizable .    to verify this property of @xmath77",
    "we first analyze their asymptotes .",
    "to start with , we rewrite the equation , being the @xmath81nd order difference equation , in a @xmath80st order form , introducing : @xmath82 in this notation the considered equation takes the form @xmath83 where , applying the notation introduced in eq .   and , one can write the matrix @xmath84 as @xmath85 the next step is expressing @xmath86 as a linear combination of the appropriately selected asymptotic functions ( further denoted as @xmath87 ) and rewriting as the equation for the coefficients of that combination . at this point",
    "we note , that numerical inspection shows qualitatively different asymptotic behavior of @xmath77 depending on whether the value of @xmath4 is below or above certain critical value @xmath7 related to the critical energy density @xmath88 @xcite or the area gap @xmath48 as follows @xmath89 since the energy density operator has been shown to be bounded by @xmath88 @xcite and the cosmological constant carries a residual gravitational energy , it is natural from the physical point of view to restrict the consideration just to @xmath6 , although for completeness we will also dedicate some attention to the @xmath3 case .      in this case , as asymptotic functions we select @xmath87 defined as @xmath90 where @xmath91 with that choice we define the vector of coefficients for each pair of consecutive points on @xmath92 @xmath93 where the transformation matrix @xmath94 is defined as @xmath95 having that , we can rewrite the equation as follows @xmath96 the exact coefficients of the matrix @xmath97 can be calculated explicitly .",
    "the property relevant for us is that for each of the prescriptions listed in sec .",
    "[ sec : frame ] it features the following asymptotic behavior @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes a matrix , whose coefficients asymptotically behave as @xmath100 .",
    "this implies immediately ( see sec .",
    "@xmath101 of @xcite ) the existence of the limit @xmath102 such that @xmath103 in consequence @xmath104 this , together with the fact , that @xmath77 is well defined and finite everywhere , implies that their norm with respect to the inner product is finite .    combining the above observation with the structure of eigenspaces discussed earlier",
    "we conclude , that the deficiency spaces @xmath76 are both @xmath80-dimensional .",
    "therefore @xcite the operator @xmath0 _ is not _ essentially self - adjoint , although it _ admits a family _ of self - adjoint extensions .",
    "each extension corresponds to the unitary transformation @xmath105 since @xmath76 are @xmath80-dimensional the only possible transformations which map the normalized @xmath106 into the space @xmath107 are as follows @xmath108 where @xmath109 is also assumed to be normalized .",
    "the family of possible extensions is thus labeled by one parameter @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "the above result can be extended in a straightforward way to other superselection sectors labeled by @xmath65 .",
    "the particular form of the extension and the detailed of its result depend on the prescription used .",
    "for the mmo one , since the triad orientations ( positive and negative @xmath63 ) separate ( see the detailed discussion in @xcite ) one can always restrict the consideration to @xmath111 . in consequence the space of solutions to",
    "is again @xmath80-dimensional and the deficiency functions are uniquely determined by their value at @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the analysis of the asymptotics described above can be applied in this case without any modifications providing exactly the same result as for @xmath62 .    for the remaining two prescriptions the situation is slightly more complicated .",
    "namely , for generic @xmath65 the eigenspaces of @xmath0 corresponding to any eigenvalue , including @xmath113 , are @xmath81-dimensional . also to verify",
    "their normalizability one needs to check the asymptotics independently for positive and negative @xmath63 .",
    "nonetheless it can still be done by direct application of the method used for @xmath62 to each of the limits .",
    "the result is the same , although while analogs of are still well defined ( and the rate of convergence is the same ) , generically @xmath114 as for @xmath62 all the solutions to are normalizable .",
    "now however @xmath115 , so the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath0 are now labeled by the elements of the @xmath116 group .    restricting the studies to the symmetric functions does not change the result for @xmath117 as the parity reflection maps the lattice @xmath66 onto @xmath118 , disjoint from the original one . in the only exceptional case @xmath119 , the symmetry imposes an additional constraint between the values of the eigenfunctions at @xmath120 and @xmath121 . in consequence",
    "the eigenspaces are again @xmath80-dimensional and the results are exactly the same as for @xmath62 .",
    "in the case @xmath122 it is convenient to introduce the following change of representation for a general superselection sector @xmath65 @xmath123 it is trivial to note that the kinematical inner product between transformed functions is given by a formula identical to . on the other hand the examination of the form of @xmath0 provided by - shows that it transforms into @xmath124 where @xmath125 is always finite and decays as @xmath126 , thus @xmath127 is a compact operator .",
    "this feature allows immediately to apply kato s perturbation theory @xcite and the self - adjointness of @xmath0 for @xmath128 @xcite to conclude , that for @xmath3 the operator @xmath0 is also essentially self - adjoint .",
    "for subcritical values of @xmath4 we have shown in sec .  [",
    "sec : subcr ] that the evolution operator @xmath0 admits ( in the principal case @xmath62 considered here ) @xmath80-parameter family of extensions @xmath129 .",
    "each of these extensions defines an evolution via with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath129 . in order to identify the physical hilbert space @xmath130 corresponding to each extension",
    "we need to know ( the positive part of ) the spectrum of @xmath129 . here",
    "we analyze some properties of it , as well as the eigenspaces corresponding to its elements .",
    "let us start with the eigenfunctions",
    ". by inspection one can easily notice that the analysis of the asymptotics of the deficiency functions performed in sec .",
    "[ sec : extensions ] extends directly to any eigenfunction corresponding to any complex eigenvalue , with the same form of the asymptotic functions and convergence rates . in consequence",
    "every eigenfunction of @xmath0 is explicitly normalizable , being thus an element of @xmath45 .",
    "this in turn implies that the spectrum of each @xmath129 is purely discrete .    to identify the spectra @xmath131 we first determine the domain of each extension , applying the theorem x.2 of @xcite .",
    "it follows from it , that the domain @xmath132 of @xmath129 in our case equals to @xmath133 where @xmath134 is given by . on the other hand @xmath132",
    "is spanned by those of the ( normalized ) eigenfunctions @xmath135 whose eigenvalues @xmath136 .",
    "as the eigenfunctions are normalizable , the ones selected by that condition also belong to @xmath132 .",
    "since the original domain @xmath74 of @xmath0 is ( a cauchy completion with respect to the graph norm of ) a space of finite linear combinations of @xmath75 , only the term @xmath137 contributes to the asymptotics of the elements @xmath132 . in consequence @xmath132",
    "is spanned by ( all and only ) the eigenfunctions @xmath138 which converge to a combination @xmath137 for some @xmath139 .    the above selection criterion , although precise , is not convenient for practical purposes . to bring it to a simpler form",
    ", we remind that all the eigenfunctions , including the deficiency functions and @xmath138 , converge to linear combinations of @xmath87 . furthermore ,",
    "as @xmath0 is a real operator , the limit of @xmath138 is necessarily of the form @xmath140 \\\\     & + o(v^{-2 } ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 and the phase shifts @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "obviously the term @xmath143 has the same form of the limit , up to an additional rotation by a global phase .",
    "furthermore , the transformation @xmath144 corresponds just to change of sign . in consequence",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between the parameters @xmath145 and @xmath146 which thus uniquely label the extensions .",
    "as one needs just to compare the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunction against the functions of a very simple analytic form , the classification with respect to @xmath147 is much better suited for practical applications , like e.g. the explicit identification of the spectra of the extended operators , as well as for finding the bases of the physical hilbert spaces .",
    "one has to remember however , that this classification is just a more convenient form of the previous one , not an alternative to it .",
    "the above results , derived for the superselection sector @xmath62 , generalize easily to other sectors , although the exact results depend ( as in the studies of sec .",
    "[ sec : subcr ] ) on the particular prescription .",
    "namely , for the mmo prescription , due to nondegeneracy of the eigenspaces of @xmath0 , the analysis presented in this section can be repeated exactly , giving exactly the same results . for the remaining two prescriptions",
    "one has to introduce slight modifications taking into account the twofold degeneracy of the eigenvalues .",
    "in particular the label of the extension , inherited from the label of the unitary transformation @xmath148 via is now an element of the @xmath116 group .",
    "all the eigenfunctions of @xmath0 are however again explicitly normalizable , and the ones spanning a particular extension are selected by the condition that a given eigenfunction @xmath138 belongs to @xmath132 iff there exists @xmath139 such that the considered eigenfunction converges to a combination @xmath149 , where @xmath134 is a transformation corresponding to a particular value of the label @xmath150 .",
    "for these cases we have proved in sec .  [",
    "sec : supercr ] that the operator @xmath0 is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "also the form of @xmath0 after the representation change suggests , that qualitatively its spectrum should resemble @xmath151 , where @xmath152 .",
    "thus we expect the whole spectrum to be quite rich .",
    "in particular the essential part or it equals just @xmath153 .",
    "as @xmath154 equals either @xmath155 ( for @xmath156 ) or is empty ( @xmath157 ) @xcite @xmath158 is purely nonpositive . on the other hand , since only @xmath159 enters ,",
    "only the positive part of @xmath160 is relevant from the physical point of view . from the above reasoning it follows immediately that it has to be purely discrete @xcite . in this section",
    "we will study exactly this part .",
    "the analysis will be again restricted just to the superselection @xmath62 and the symmetric functions .",
    "the discreteness of the positive part of the spectrum implies , that the eigenfunctions corresponding to it have to be explicitly normalizable .",
    "one can show however , that no such function exists at least for selected prescriptions and superselection sector .",
    "indeed , from ,   and the positivity of @xmath161 and @xmath162 for @xmath163 follows , that the solution to the equation @xmath164 satisfies the relation    [ eq : eigenf - neq]@xmath165    this and the fact that for chosen superselection sector all the eigenfunctions @xmath166 are determined by their initial values @xmath167 implies @xmath168 thus , defining the ratios @xmath169 we have @xmath170 furthermore , @xmath171 satisfy the equation ( following directly from ,  ) @xmath172 which together with ( following from - ) positivity of @xmath173 and @xmath162 for @xmath163 implies @xmath174 in consequence , by induction we have @xmath175 on the other hand , taking as @xmath176 the functions @xmath177 one can perform the analysis of the asymptotics analogous to the one in sec .",
    "[ sec : subcr ] , showing that @xmath178 where , due to the existence of both @xmath179 and @xmath180 ( where @xmath181 is an analog of the matrix defined in ) for some large enough @xmath182 , and the fact that the eigenfunction is uniquely determined by its value at @xmath183 , at least one of the coefficients @xmath184 , @xmath185 does not vanish .    from the relations",
    "and we see , that for @xmath3 none of the eigenfunctions corresponding to the positive eigenvalues are normalizable . in consequence",
    "the positive part of the spectrum of @xmath0 is empty , thus the physical hilbert spaces corresponding to those values of @xmath4 are trivial .    this result can not be immediately extended to the remaining superselection sectors as for some prescriptions and values of @xmath65 the validity of the inequalities and ( generalized to include the initial data at two points ) as well as the statement of nonvanishing of @xmath186 might be affected near @xmath187 by the different behavior of the functions @xmath188 there . therefore we can not exclude the existence of normalizable eigenfunction in those cases .",
    "one can see however , that , as up to the transformation the eigenfunctions have the same asymptotic properties as the ( corresponding to the negative eigenvalues ) eigenfunctions of @xmath0 for @xmath128 . in consequence",
    "all the normalizable eigenfunctions have to decay exponentially ( @xmath189 ) or like @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "furthermore , due to the form of coefficients of @xmath0 they have to enter this behavior already at @xmath192 .",
    "this is possible only for low values of @xmath193 as for the larger ones the term @xmath194 is a dominating one at @xmath195 , which again forces the behavior similar to the asymptotic one . in consequence",
    "any possible normalizable eigenfunctions necessarily correspond to small eigenvalues and are peaked near the classical singularity .",
    "we have considered the evolution operator @xmath0 defining the evolution of the isotropic flat universe with massless scalar field and positive cosmological constant quantized within the framework of loop quantum cosmology . for the investigation three exact forms of the operator corresponding to particular prescriptions @xcite ( aps ) , @xcite ( slqc ) and @xcite ( mmo )",
    "were selected .",
    "our main goal was the verification of its self - adjointness as the condition necessary to generate a unique unitary evolution in the schrdinger picture .",
    "we also investigated the properties of the hilbert spaces defined by the spectra of possible self - adjoint extensions of @xmath0 .",
    "the results of the studies happen to depend on the value of the cosmological constant @xmath4 .",
    "namely , one can divide the set of its values onto two regions separated by the critical value related with the critical energy density @xcite via the equality @xmath196 for which the properties of @xmath0 are qualitatively different .    for @xmath8 ( denoted as subcritical )",
    "@xmath0 admits many self - adjoint extensions , each of them defining inequivalent ( at least at the mathematical level ) unitary evolution .",
    "the extensions are labeled by the elements of the @xmath197 or @xmath116 group , depending on the superselection sector . in particular , once the studies are restricted to the symmetric functions only , the groups of labels @xmath198 are @xmath199    once the self - adjoint extensions were identified their spectral properties were also studied .",
    "it was shown that the spectrum of each extension is discrete , thus the physical hilbert space spanned by the set of normalizable eigenfunctions of @xmath0 .    for @xmath3 ( supercritical ) found relation with the operators @xmath0 for @xmath128 allowed to show , that the evolution operator is essentially self - adjoint , thus generating a unique unitary evolution .",
    "further studies have shown however that for the superselection sector @xmath62 the positive part of the spectrum of @xmath0 is empty ,",
    "thus the physical hilbert space defined by it is trivial .",
    "this situation might change in other superselection sectors .",
    "there however , even if nontrivial , the hilbert space does not admit any physically interesting states .",
    "the result of the above paragraph is analogous to the properties of the scalar field energy density operator performed in @xcite , where it was shown , that for @xmath3 the absolutely continuous part of the spectrum of that operator is entirely non - positive and the eigenfunctions corresponding to the positive elements of the spectrum ( necessarily belonging to its discrete part ) are peaked about @xmath187 .    in the subcritical case @xmath6 the existence of non - unique extensions implies in particular that the quantum evolution of the system is not explicitly unique .",
    "however the detailed studies of its dynamics show @xcite that in the semiclassical regime the dynamical predictions are surprisingly unique and in the limit @xmath200 consistent with the ( unique ) analytic extension of the classical trajectory .    to conclude ,",
    "let us note that the results regarding self - adjointness directly extend ( with the exception of the case @xmath191 ) to the cases of different topologies ( @xmath201 ) , as the terms in @xmath0 present in such models are subleading with respect to the term @xmath202 . furthermore applying the methods presented here one can easily show that for the models @xmath203 and @xmath204 ( defined in @xcite ) the evolution operator also admits non - unique extensions . by the relation this result applies also to @xmath205 .",
