    "stephan s quintet ( hereafter sq ) is a strongly interacting compact group which has produced a highly disturbed intragroup medium ( igm ) @xcite through a complex sequence of interactions and harrassment @xcite .",
    "this interplay has produced a large - scale intergalactic shock - wave , first observed as a narrow filament in the radio continuum  @xcite , and subsequently detected in the x - ray  @xcite .",
    "the high - velocity ( @xmath61000 km  s@xmath13 ) collision of an intruder galaxy , ngc 7318b , with the intergalactic medium of the group  @xcite is believed to be responsible for the shock - heating of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "optical emission line ratios and observed broad linewidths provide evidence that the region is powered by strong shocks and not star formation ( xu et al . 2003 ; duc et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "the main elements of stephan s quintet are shown in figure 1 .",
    "central to the system is the primary shock , as defined by the 20 cm radio continuum emission .",
    "ngc 7318b , the intruder galaxy , lies to the west of the shock , while the large seyfert 2 galaxy @xcite , lies to the east .",
    "other members of the group are also indicated .",
    "the peculiar extranuclear star formation region , named sq - a @xcite , lies at the extreme northern end of the main shock wave .",
    "ngc 7318a ( west of ngc 7318b ) is also a strongly interacting group member , with ngc 7317 further away from the core .",
    "the unexpected discovery of extremely powerful , pure - rotational h@xmath9 line emission from the center of the shock @xcite , using the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite , has sparked intense interest in the sq system .",
    "warm molecular hydrogen emission was found with a line luminosity exceeding the x - ray luminosity from the shock .",
    "the mid - infrared ( mir ) h@xmath9 linewidth was resolved ( @xmath14 870 km s@xmath13 ) suggesting that the h@xmath9-emitting clouds carry a large bulk - kinetic energy , tapping a large percentage of the energy available in the shock .",
    "a recent model of sq , involving the collision between two inhomogeneous gas flows , describes h@xmath9 formation out of the multiphase , shocked gas , and an efficient cooling channel for high - speed shocks as an alternative to x - ray emission @xcite    since the sq detection , several other systems exhibiting similarly strong h@xmath9 emission have been discovered .",
    "@xcite find that a large - subset of the local 3cr radio galaxies have extremely dominant mir rotational h@xmath9 lines , often seen against a very weak thermal continuum .",
    "the low agn and star formation power are insufficient to drive the mir h@xmath5  emission . mechanical heating driven by the radio jet interaction with the host galaxy ism is the favoured mechanism .",
    "in addition , total h@xmath9 luminosities in the range @xmath15 ergs s@xmath13 have been detected in some central cluster galaxies out to @xmath16 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* g. de messieres - university of virginia , private communication ) and in filaments in clusters @xcite .",
    "the study of nearby prototypes may provide valuable insight into the nature of these more distant systems . the large scale ( @xmath6  30  kpc ) of the sq shock is well - suited for such a study .    in this paper",
    "i , we extend the single pointing observations of @xcite to full spectral maps of sq using the irs instrument on the _ spitzer _ space telescope , hereafter _ spitzer_. in paper ii",
    ", we will present detailed 2-dimensional excitation maps of the h@xmath5 emission across the face of the x - ray emitting shock , and compare them with models .",
    "in addition , several other papers are being prepared by our team which will discuss the relationship between the uv / x - ray emission and emission from dust .    in section 2",
    ", we present our observations and data reduction methods . in section 3",
    "we discuss the mapping results for various detected lines . in sections 4 , 5 and 6",

    "we present our conclusions .",
    "additional material is included as appendices , with a discussion on ngc 7319 in appendix a , and a reanalysis of the high resolution mir spectrum of the shock , as well as renanalysis of the x - ray data presented in appendix b and c , respectively .    throughout this paper , we assume a systemic velocity of @xmath17 for the group , corresponding to a distance of 94 mpc with @xmath18 .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopy of the shock region in sq was obtained using the irs instrument @xcite onboard _",
    "spitzer_. observations were done in low - resolution mapping mode , using the short - low ( @xmath19 ; @xmath20 ) and long - low ( @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ) modules and taken on january 11 2008 and december 10 2007 , respectively .",
    "figure 1 displays the outline of the areas observed superimposed on a composite image of the group .",
    "the sl spectral mapping consists of two separate , partially overlapping maps , centered north and south on the x - ray emission associated with the shock .",
    "the map was constructed with 23 steps of 2.8(0.75 @xmath2 slit width ) perpendicular to the slit and one parallel step of 7.2 .",
    "observations consisted of 60s integrations with 5 cycles per step .",
    "the ll module was used to map an area of @xmath23 using 21 steps of 8.0  ( 0.75 @xmath2 slit width ) perpendicular to the slit and a parallel step of 24.0 .",
    "an integration time of 120s was used with 3 cycles per step .",
    "primary data reductions were done by the _ spitzer _",
    "science center ( ssc ) pipeline , version s17.0.4 and s17.2.0 for sl and ll respectively , which performs standard reductions such as ramp fitting , dark current subtraction and flat - fielding .",
    "background subtraction for ll data was performed by subtracting dedicated off - source observations , with the same observing mode , taken shortly after the mapping sequence . in the case of sl , where for scheduling reasons the dedicated `` off '' observations were too far away in time to be optimal , backgrounds were generated from observations at the periphery of the map that contain no spectral line signatures .",
    "examination of the pipeline products showed that the stray - light - corrected images ( that account for potential spillover from the peak - up arrays onto the sl1/2 spectral apertures ) contained wavelength - dependent over - corrections in some of the images , seemingly due to a high background of cosmic rays during the sl portion of the mapping . to negate this effect , the alternative flat - fielded images ( also available from the science pipeline ) that are uncorrected for crosstalk and straylight removal were used .",
    "it was determined that after background subtraction , any uncorrected stray light in the sl spectral extraction areas was unmeasurable at the @xmath24% level .",
    "thus stray - light correction was unneccesary , and the resulting basic calibrated data ( bcd ) images used were of better quality than the standard bcds .    for all modules , individual frames for each pointing",
    "were median - combined and obvious `` bad '' pixels were replaced using customised software that allows for manual `` average '' replacement .",
    "the spectra were assembled into spectral cubes for each module using the software tool , cubism @xcite .",
    "further bad pixel removal was performed within cubism .",
    "spectral maps were generated by making continuum maps on either side of a feature and subtracting the averaged continuum map from the relevant emission line map .",
    "one dimensional spectra were further extracted from the data cubes using matched apertures .",
    "broad - band images at 16 and 24@xmath25 m were obtained with the _ spitzer _ irs blue peak - up imager ( pui ) and the mips instrument .",
    "the pui was obtained in a 5 x 5 map with 3 cycles of 30s duration each on 2007 december 10 .",
    "the mips instrument @xcite on _ spitzer _ obtained 24  imaging of sq on 2008 july 29 , achieving a spatial resolution of @xmath66 .",
    "primary data reduction was done by the _ spitzer _",
    "science center ( ssc ) science pipeline ( version s18.0.2 ) run through the mopex software , and for the mips image a smooth 2d polynomial background was further removed to correct for a large - scale background gradient . _",
    "spitzer _ irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  data of sq ( p.i .",
    "houck ) were obtained from the ssc archive ; these were reduced using science pipeline version s18.0.2 .",
    "the final mosaics have a pixel scale of 0.61 .",
    "the pure rotational transitions of molecular hydrogen can be excited by several mechanisms .",
    "these include fuv ( far ultraviolet ) induced pumping , and possible additional collisional heating , of the h@xmath5  in photodissociation regions associated with star formation ( e. g. black & van dishoeck 1987 , hollenbach & tielens 1997 ) , hard x - rays penetrating and heating regions within molecular clouds , which in turn excite h@xmath5  via collisions with electrons or hydrogen atoms ( lepp & mccray 1983 ; draine & woods 1992 ) and finally collisional excitation of h@xmath5  due to acceleration produced by shocks ( e.g. shull & hollenbach 1978 ) .",
    "the pure rotational mir line ratios are not especially good diagnostics for distinguishing between these mechanisms since all three mechanisms discussed can lead to well thermalized level distributions of lower - level rotational states .",
    "the rotational h@xmath5  emission lines do , however , allow us to trace gas at different temperatures and compare with model predictions ( this will be the main emphasis of paper ii ) .",
    "higher level transitions 0 - 0 s(3)-s(5 ) tend to trace warmer gas , whereas the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines are sensitive to the `` coolest '' warm h@xmath5 .",
    "although the line ratios themselves can not be used directly as shock diagnostics , in stephan s quintet the distribution of large - scale x - ray and radio emission , plus optical emission line diagnostics , provide strong evidence that the giant filament seen in figure 1 is the result of a strong shock . in appleton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) this fact was used to reveal the surprising association of detected h@xmath5  emission with the shock . however , in this paper we can make a more definitive association of the emission with the shock by means of spectral maps .",
    "the spectral cubes were used to extract maps of all the pure rotational emission lines of molecular hydrogen that were detected , namely the 0 - 0 s(0)28.22 , s(1)17.03 , s(2)12.28 , s(3)9.66 , s(4)8.03  and s(5)6.91  lines .",
    "specific intensity contour maps of these lines are presented in figure 2 overlaid on a @xmath26-band image of the region from @xcite .",
    "the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines were mapped by the ll modules , while s(2 ) - s(5 ) transitions were mapped by the sl modules of the irs . as indicated in figure 1 ,",
    "the sl observations were concentrated on the main shock to provide high signal to noise ( s / n ) measurements there . as a result",
    ", these maps do not fully cover sq - a or ngc 7319 .",
    "we note that the s(4 ) line at 8.03  ( fig .",
    "2e ) is faint , and also suffers from contamination from the pah bands at 7.7  and 8.6 .",
    "the contours indicate powerful , widespread emission running north - south along the shock ridge ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in addition",
    "we detect strong emission from the star forming region , sq - a , as well as associated with ngc 7319 .",
    "we discuss further details of the agn - like mir emission lines from ngc  7319 in appendix a.    figures 2a - d reveal a new h@xmath5  structure running eastward from the `` main '' shock ridge . in what follows",
    ", we refer to this feature as the `` bridge '' .",
    "this structure is observed faintly in the _ chandra _ @xcite and xmm @xcite x - ray images and detected as faint h@xmath27 emission by @xcite , but is not strong in radio continuum images .",
    "as is evident in figure 2 , there is distinct variation in the distribution of the warm h@xmath5  emission . the brightest 0 - 0  s(0 ) emission ( fig .",
    "2a ) appears to be concentrated towards the north of the shock , whereas the 0 - 0  s(1 ) transition emission ( fig .",
    "2b ) appears more concentrated towards the center .",
    "the s(0 ) and s(1 ) maps demonstrate that the h@xmath5  in the bridge terminates in a large clump a few arcsecs west of the nucleus of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  7319 , and in a small detour to the north ( especially in the s(1 ) map which has the highest s / n ) .",
    "the s(2 ) through s(5 ) lines clearly show that the warm h@xmath5  emission breaks into clumps in the shock . despite the limited coverage compared to the ll mapping ,",
    "the base of the `` bridge '' is visible and sq - a is partially covered .",
    "sq - a is fully covered by the sl2 module ( because of fortuitous `` off observation '' coverage ) and hence the s(5 ) emission line reveals that in sq - a the h@xmath5  emission is also clumpy .",
    "the molecular - line maps provide considerable information about the excitation of the h@xmath5  along and across the x - ray shock , but these discussions will be deferred to a full 2-d modelling of the h@xmath5  excitation in paper ii ( appleton et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "instead we shall limit ourselves to global properties of the h@xmath5  here . in section [ spec ]",
    "we shall present spectra of some selected regions of the emission and discuss a global excitation diagram for the shock .        to further demonstrate the close connection between the h@xmath5  emission and the main global shock - wave in sq",
    ", we now consider the distribution of warm h@xmath5  in relation to the x - ray and radio emission .",
    "figure [ fig : xray_rad]a and b show the s(0 ) and s(3 ) contours overlaid on an xmm - newton x - ray image @xcite of stephan s quintet .",
    "the warm molecular hydrogen is distributed along the length of the main north - south ( ns ) x - ray shock ridge and along the `` bridge '' , demonstrating the remarkable projected coexistence of of hot x - ray plasma ( 10@xmath28 @xmath29 t @xmath29 10@xmath30 k ) and warm h@xmath5 ( 10@xmath31 @xmath29 t@xmath29 10@xmath32 k ) .",
    "although the h@xmath5  appears to follow the x - ray , there are subtle differences .",
    "the cooler s(0 ) line has emission concentrated to the north and follows the x - ray less closely compared to the warmer s(3 ) line .",
    "the s(3 ) line exhibits a clear correspondence to the x - ray , notably at the center of the shock , where we find peaks at both wavelengths .",
    "thus the region of greatest shock heating , as traced by the stronger x - ray emission , appears to correspond to the higher - j h@xmath5  transitions , perhaps implying a causal connection .",
    "the intergalactic star formation region sq - a , is essentially absent in x - ray emission , as seen in figure [ fig : xray_rad]a , but is strongly detected in h@xmath9 .",
    "we find a similar picture in the radio continuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray_rad]c & d ) with the s(0 ) line demonstrating correspondence with the main shock , but dominated by emission in the north where we observe less powerful radio emission .",
    "the s(3 ) ( and s(2)see fig .",
    "2c ) line presents a much tighter correlation with regions of the shock that are more radio luminous than the lower - j transitions .",
    "the radio emission is quite likely sensitive to the most compressed regions of the shock where cosmic ray particles are accelerated more strongly @xcite , whereas the brightest x - ray patches are likely due to the fastest regions of the shock @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned the `` bridge '' emission is detected only faintly in the x - ray and is weak or absent at radio continuum wavelengths .",
    "this noticeable difference compared to the main shock likely implies that the conditions that give rise to strong synchrotron emission in the main shock are absent in the bridge .",
    "emission from fine - structure lines provide key diagnostics that trace the interplay between the various constituents of the shocked interstellar medium . in @xcite",
    "the spectra were limited to the very core of the shock and only weak emission was detected from all but two metal lines , namely @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81and @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82  ( this data has been reanalysed and is presented in appendix b ) . in this section",
    "we discuss the spatial distribution of emission from the @xmath10feii@xmath11$]25.99 , @xmath10oiv@xmath11$]25.89 , @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48 , @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82 , @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81  and @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  lines .    in figure",

    "spitzer _ , we can not distinguish between emission from @xmath10fe ii@xmath11$]25.99  and @xmath10oiv@xmath11$]25.89 .",
    "however , except in the direction of the seyfert ii galaxy ngc  7319 , the emission near 26  seen in figure [ fig : fs]a is likely to be pure @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] with little contamination from @xmath10oiv@xmath11 $ ] as there is no evidence from the spectra of high - excitation emission from the intragroup medium in sq .",
    "for example , @xmath10oiv@xmath11 $ ] has an excitation potential of 56 ev ( compared to 7.9 ev of @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] ) , and yet @xcite have shown that the @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]/@xmath10neii@xmath11 $ ] ratio is low suggesting low - excitation conditions for the ions in the shock , further supported in section [ em ] . assuming that , apart from towards ngc  7319 , @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] dominates the @xmath10feii@xmath11$]+@xmath10oiv@xmath11 $ ] complex , we detect faint emission from @xmath10feii@xmath11$]25.99  at the location of the center of the shock ( as defined by the x - ray `` hotspot '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : xray_rad]a ) . the energetic requirements for shocks to produce strong @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] emission are usually present in @xmath33 shocks while the ion abundance in @xmath34 shocks are low in comparison @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the production of @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] in the shock in section 6.2 .",
    "the @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  distribution is presented in figure [ fig : fs]b .",
    "this fine structure line acts as a strong tracer of hii  regions @xcite and we observe emission from sq - a and from other regions of star formation in the south ( see section [ sf ] ) . in the primary shock region the distributions of @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] and @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] are anti - correlated .    in strong contrast to the weak @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] emission , there is copious @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82  emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs]c ) , which follows the s(1 ) distribution closely with respect to the primary shock , as mapped by x - ray emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs]d ) .",
    "although @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] is commonly found in normal hii  regions , we will demonstrate below that , apart from in sq - a , the strong silicon emission does not correlate with regions of strong pah emission ( tracing star formation ) in sq , but instead closely follows the h@xmath5  and x - ray ( shock ) distributions . @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] acts as an efficient coolant of x - ray - irradiated gas and is predicted to be one of the top four cooling lines under these circumstances @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the excitation of @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] in the shock in section 6.2 .",
    "@xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81  ( with an ionisation potential of 21.6 ev ) is also represented in the shock , as shown in figure [ fig : ne]a , although it is also emitted from some hii  regions associated with star formation , such as sq - a and the star - forming region south of ngc 7318b ( see section [ sf ] ) .",
    "the @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  contours ( with an ionisation potential of 41 ev ) are shown in figure [ fig : ne]b and are associated with excitation in the shock , as well as from regions of star formation ( see section [ sf ] )",
    ". the higher ionisation line of @xmath10neiii@xmath11 $ ] is much weaker in the shock ridge , but regions of emission correspond closely to peaks seen for the h@xmath5  s(3 ) line . the @xmath10neii@xmath11 $ ] emission , however , exhibits clearly extended emission with regions of greatest luminosity matching those seen for the h@xmath5  s(3 ) line .",

    "previous observations and spectroscopy of sq @xcite have determined that there are some regions of star formation associated with the spiral arms of the intruder galaxy ngc  7318b .",
    "we discuss in this section how these regions , which have a different spatial distribution from the shocked gas , are correlated with the pah emission we detect in the irs spectra .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dust]a there is a strong correlation between the 11.3  pah distribution ( from the irs cube ) superimposed on a near - uv image from _ galex _ @xcite , which maps the uv emission from hot stars associated with weak star formation from the system .",
    "this correlation suggests that the pah molecules are excited by star formation .",
    "a similar close correlation is shown in figure [ fig : dust]b where we overlay the 11.3  contours on the irac 8  band , which is dominated by the 7.7 and 8.6 @xmath25 m feature .",
    "it is noticeable , however , that regions with strong 11.3  emission in the shock , do not appear similarly strong at 8 .",
    "this point will be addressed in section 6.4 .",
    "we compare the 11.3  pah map to the distribution of warm dust in figure [ fig : dust]c , using the mips 24@xmath25 m map of sq .",
    "again , it is clear that there is a good correlation between the pah emission and the thermal dust , most of which seems only poorly correlated with the shock ridge .",
    "the lack of conspicuous star formation in the ridge was also observed by @xcite .",
    "the main point we emphasize here is that the dust , pah and uv emission appears to be associated with previously known star formation regions and no additional star formation is observed in the shock ; this can be seen in figure [ fig : dust]d showing the h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(1 ) emission overlaid on an irac 8  image .",
    "there is little correspondence between the h@xmath5  emission in the shock and 8@xmath25 m ( hot dust plus pah ) image .",
    "this is important because it implies that there is very little triggered star formation in the molecular gas associated with the shock - excited h@xmath5 .",
    "figure [ fig : dust]c demonstrates that there is only faint dust emission at 24@xmath25 m from the shock ridge .",
    "the presence of dust in the shock is required in the model of guillard et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to explain the formation of h@xmath5  behind the shock and we do observe evidence of depletion onto dust grains ( see section 6.2 ) . thus the faint 24  emission could be the result of destruction of very small grains ( vsgs ) , with only larger grains surviving , or indicate that the grains are cold and radiating more strongly at longer wavelengths , where _ spitzer _ has the least spatial resolution .",
    "a more detailed description of the dust and faint pah emission in the sq group ( including results from mips 70  imaging ) is discussed in separate papers ( guillard et al . 2010 . ; natale et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "guillard et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show that the ir emission in the shock is faint due to dust being heated by a relatively low intensity uv radiation field and determine a galactic pah / vsg abundance ratio in this region .",
    "a more complete understanding of the likely existence of cool dust in the shock will require higher angular resolution and a broader wavelength coverage than that achieved by _",
    "spitzer_.    despite the faintness of emission from the main shock , the 24@xmath25 m map presents a new result , which was less obvious in previous studies , namely that the dominant regions of star formation in sq lie not in the galaxies themselves , but in two strikingly powerful , almost symmetrically disposed regions at either end of the shock .",
    "the region to the north is the well studied sq - a , but the region to the south ( which we refer to as 7318b - south ) is also very powerful and both regions lie at the ends of the shock , as defined by the h@xmath5  distribution .",
    "this may not be a coincidence , and we will discuss this further in section 6.1 .",
    "the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81 , @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  and @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  fine - structure lines , as mentioned above , are also tracers of star formation in sq as these lines are often associated with hii  regions .",
    "the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81  emission appears to follow _ both _ the h@xmath5  and the star formation regions ( see fig . [",

    "[ fig : dust ] ) .",
    "the warm molecular hydrogen in stephan s quintet follows the x - ray distribution in the main shock and in the `` bridge '' structure .",
    "this might suggest that the molecular hydrogen is excited directly by the x - ray heating .",
    "however , we will show that the h@xmath5  emission exceeds by at least a factor of 3 the x - ray luminosity from the various shocked filaments , thus ruling out direct x - ray excitation from the shock .    to measure the strength of the h@xmath5  emission ,",
    "we extract spectra from various rectangular sub - areas of sq which are defined in figure [ fig : ext ] .",
    "the spectra were extracted from cubism cubes built from each irs module , and joined to make a continous spectrum ",
    "no scaling was necessary to join the spectra .",
    "figures [ fig : ext ]  a ,  b and c indicate the spectral extraction regions of the main ns shock , a sub - region of the shock and a characteristic part of the `` bridge '' . the shock sub - region is chosen to be just north of the center of the shock , avoiding regions contaminated by star formation in the intruder .",
    "spectra for these extractions are shown in figure [ fig : spectra ]  a , b and c. all three spectra , share the common property that they are dominated by molecular hydrogen emission .",
    "the shock sub - region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra]b ) , unlike figure [ fig : spectra]a , is less contaminated by the star forming regions discussed in the previous section . the mir continuum of the main shock appears stronger than the shock sub - region indicating stronger emission from warm dust ; this is likely the result of contamination from star - forming regions in the main shock extraction .",
    "the bridge exhibits a similarly weak continuum emission compared to the shock sub - region .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra]b includes photometry from the irac bands , 16  peak - up image ( pui ) and mips-24  image superimposed on the irs spectrum .",
    "these are useful to probe conditions in the shock , in particular star formation ( see section 6.4 ) .",
    "stellar light in the extraction area , from an extended spiral arm of ngc 7318b , produces contamination of the shock spectrum , visible as continuum emission shortwards of 6 , in both figure 8a and b.    there exists a striking similarity between the mid - ir spectrum of all three regions , showing powerful h@xmath5  lines and low excitation weak emission from fine structure lines . also the pah emission observed in the spectra of the shock regions , and in the region of the `` bridge '' in the irac 8  image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dust]b ) , appears weak .",
    "this confirms that these properties , observed in the @xcite observations of the shock core , extend to both the full extent of the main shock and the `` bridge '' .",
    "this , and the fact that the `` bridge '' has similar x - ray properties to the main shock ( see later ) suggests that the bridge is a `` scaled - down '' version of the main shock .",
    "the weaker radio continuum emission at this location is significant .",
    "one possibility , that the `` bridge '' is older than the main shock , and the cosmic rays compressed in it have diffused away , will be discussed further in paper ii.thus the new irs observations seem to suggest that more than one large - scale group - wide shock is present in the group .",
    "this could be the result of previous tidal interactions and imply multiple shock heating events have taken place in sq , consistent with what is seen in the x - ray @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : ext]d and [ fig : spectra]d present the extraction region and spectrum of sq - a , the extragalactic star - forming region . in this case , although h@xmath5  lines are still strong , a rising continuum and an increase in the strength of the metal lines relative to the h@xmath5  is consistent with a spectrum that is increasingly dominated by star formation  a result which is already known from previous optical observations @xcite .",
    "line fluxes for all the h@xmath5  and metal lines in the spectra discussed above are presented in table  [ tableh2fluxes ] and table  [ tablemetalfluxes ] , respectively .",
    "we estimate the luminosity emitted from the h@xmath5  lines in the main aperture shown in figure [ fig : spectra]a .",

    "summing the emission measured in the observed lines for the main shock ( 0 - 0 s(0 ) through s(5 ) lines ) and including an extra 28% emission from unobserved lines ( see model fit to excitation diagram below ) , yields a total h@xmath5  line luminosity from the main shock of 9.7  @xmath210@xmath35 ergs@xmath13 .",
    "this phenomenal power in the molecular hydrogen lines dwarfs by a factor of ten the next brightest mid - ir line , which is @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82  with a line luminosity of l@xmath36 = 0.85 @xmath210@xmath35 ergs@xmath13 .",

    "it is likely that in reality , many different temperature components are present in the shock , and the three - temperature fit is only an approximation .",
    "however , it does allow us to provide an estimate of the total mass of warm h@xmath5  of 5.0@xmath4210@xmath43m@xmath44 .",
    "temperature t@xmath9 is more uncertain than formally represented by the fit because it depends on the value of the s(4 ) flux , which may be systematically too low due to pah contamination ( see fig .",

    "ii we will present a more complete two - dimensional map of the excitation of the h@xmath5  in sq and explore variations in the shape of the excitation diagram along and across the shock in more detail .",
    "our observations have shown that h@xmath5  is the dominant line coolant in the mir .",
    "however , how does it compare with the most important coolant in high - speed shocks  namely the x - ray emission ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the h@xmath5  emission was stronger than the x - ray emission at the shock center .",
    "this can now be evaluated over much of the inner sq group .",
    "we present a complete reanalysis of the xmm - newton observations of sq using the latest calibrations ( see appendix c for full details ) in order to determine the fluxes and luminosities of the x - ray emission to match our spectral extractions .",
    "the results indicate the striking dominance of the h@xmath5  line luminosities compared with the x - ray emission from the same regions . for the main shock , the x - ray `` bolometric '' flux of l@xmath45 = 2.8  @xmath2  10@xmath46erg  s@xmath13@xmath47 corresponds to 2.95 @xmath2  10@xmath35  erg  s@xmath13 , or l(h@xmath5)/l@xmath45 = 2.9 .",
    "this is a lower limit since we have not attempted to remove the contribution to the main shock aperture of an extended group - wide x - ray component upon which the emission from the shock lies . therefore it is likely that the h@xmath5  line luminosity dominates over the main shock x - ray gas by a factor @xmath48 3 .",
    "similar calculations can be done for the other regions for which h@xmath5  spectra have been extracted .",
    "for example , in the `` bridge '' region , which we have already indicated has many of the same characteristics as the main shock , we find l(h@xmath5)/l@xmath45  =  2.5 .",
    "these values demonstrate that throughout the extended regions of sq , the molecular hydrogen cooling pathway dominates over the x - ray in this shocked system .",
    "this is a very significant result , upturning the traditional view that x - ray emission always dominates cooling in the later stages of evolution in compact groups of galaxies .",
    "the fine - structure flux ratios ( see table [ tablemetalfluxes ] ) can be used to probe the conditions within the extracted regions of sq .",
    "the @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82/@xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  ratio provides an indication of the sources of excitation within the system .",

    "the shock subregion has a ratio of only @xmath55 indicating a lower intensity radiation field north of the shock center .",
    "however , it is clear from its spatial distribution relative to the 8  and h@xmath5  emission , that most of the neon is not originating from star formation , and so shocks are an obvious source of excitation .",
    "the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81/@xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  ratio can be used to estimate the shock velocity using the mappings shock model library of @xcite . in the main shock",

    "we do , however , have contamination from starforming regions in the main shock and can not disentangle this emission from that produced in the shock . to address this we use the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81  and @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  maps to mask areas associated with star formation ( see section 3.3 ) and determine a lower limit for the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81/@xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  ratio in the shock of @xmath6  4.54 .",

    "our observations have shown that the molecular hydrogen and x - ray emitting plasma appear to follow a similar distribution , and we have ruled out the possibility that this is a consequence of x - rays heating the h@xmath5 , since the h@xmath5  has the dominant luminosity .",
    "how then can we explain the similar distributions ?",
    "are these results consistent with the hypothesis that the shock is formed where the intruding galaxy ngc 7318b collides with a pre - existing tidal filament of hi  drawn out of ngc 7319 in a previous interaction with another group member @xcite ?",
    "this basic mechanical picture appears plausible as can be seen in figure [ fig : hi+h2 ] which shows that the h@xmath5  distribution `` fills in '' the gap in the hi  tidal tail as observed by the vla @xcite .",
    "the implication is that the hi  has been converted into both a hot x - ray component and a warm h@xmath5  component by the collision of the intruder with the now missing hi .",
    "part of the puzzle of how this high - speed ( @xmath60 @xmath61 kms@xmath13 ) shock can lead to both x - ray and very strong molecular line emission is presented in a model by @xcite .",
    "the high - speed collision of ngc  7318b with the hi  filament ( assumed to be composed of a multiphase medium ) leads to multiple shocks passing through and compressing denser clumps ( which become dusty nucleation sites for h@xmath5  formation ) as opposed to the lower - density gas , which is shock - heated to x - ray tempertures .",
    "the h@xmath5  therefore forms in denser clouds experiencing slower shocks .",
    "thus the coexistence of both hot x - ray gas , and cooler molecular material is a natural consequence of the multiphase medium of the pre - shocked material .",
    "modeling of the h@xmath5  excitation by @xcite demonstrates that the emission can be reproduced by low velocity ( @xmath62 ) magnetohydrodynamic shocks within the dense ( @xmath63 ) h@xmath5  gas .",
    "the denser clouds survive long enough to be heated by turbulence in the hot - gas component , tapping into the large available kinetic energy of the shock .",
    "this picture is consistent with both the broad h@xmath5  linewidth ( 870kms@xmath13 ) measured in irs high - resolution spectrometer observations of @xcite , and the velocity center of the warm h@xmath5  ( based on new irs spectral calibrations - see appendix b ) which places the gas at intermediate velocities between the intruder and the group igm .",
    "both these measurements are consistent with h@xmath5  being accelerated in a turbulent post - shocked layer .",
    "intermediate pre - shock densities and post - shock temperatures result in regions of hi  and hii  that have cooled , but where the dust content has been destroyed @xcite .",
    "pre - existing giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) which may have been embedded in the hi  gas , would be rapidly compressed and collapse quickly , thus forming stars.this mechanism , proposed for sq - a by @xcite , might also apply to 7318b - south . however , if this was the case , it would have to explain why two such gmcs happened to be positioned at the extreme ends of the current shock  an unlikely coincidence .",
    "more probable , however , is that the geometry of the shock somehow favors the collapse of clouds at the ends of the shock  perhaps in regions where the turbulent heating is less efficient .",
    "as outlined above , the combination of emission detected in the shock region of sq can be understood in terms of a spectrum of shock velocities .",
    "the fastest shock velocities ( @xmath64 km@xmath0 ) are associated with the lowest density pre - shock regions and the post - shock x - ray emitting plasma .",

    "the suppression of the 7.7/11.3  pah ratio has been observed in agn environments ( e.g. low - luminosity agn in the sings sample of * ? ? ? * ) and is favored to be the result of selective destruction of pah molecules small enough to emit at 7.7 .",
    "pah processing in the shock due to larger molecules being less fragile than smaller ones is discussed further in guillard et al .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the pah molecules are chiefly large and neutral in the shock , producing enhanced 11.3  emission in comparison to the smaller pah molecules .",
    "a detailed comparison of the dust and pah emission properties can be found in guillard et al .",

    "dust emission in the mid- and far - infrared can be used to infer the amount of star formation taking place @xcite .",

    "we find @xmath80 , but caution that h@xmath27 emission in sq is also the result of shock - excitation @xcite and must be considered an upper limit for measuring star formation . when we combine @xmath81 with @xmath82 , using the relation of @xcite , we find a sfr of @xmath290.05@xmath83",

    "the shock subregion has a 7.7  flux density of 0.73 mjy which corresponds to a sfr of @xmath84 , in good agreement with our previous calculation , but also an upper limit as some pah emission is contamination from known star formation regions in the group . a point of caution",

    "comparing the @xmath85(7.7)/@xmath82 ratio to the galaxies in sings , we find that the value of @xmath86 is typical of star - forming galaxies @xcite , which suggests that both measures of star formation are low , but self - consistent .",
    "the low _ upper limits _ for the sfr in the shock suggests that star formation is depressed in the shock apart from in the igm starburst , sq - a , which has a sfr of @xmath87 at the velocity of the group @xcite",
    ". this would be consistent with a picture of molecular hydrogen being reheated by mhd shocks in the turbulent medium .",
    "since the jeans mass increases with gas temperature and turbulence and shearing morions will prevent collapse , the cold molecular gas clouds may be too short - lived or undersized to facilitate collapse and produce significant star formation @xcite .",
    "the extent of a cold reservoir of molecular gas in the shock is a key consideration in this scenario , as discussed in section [ co ] .",
    "the present observations suggest that molecular line cooling in dense clumps dissipates a significant fraction of the kinetic energy available in high - speed shocks . for reference , and to provide a glimpse of what this group might look like at high redshift when filling a single beam , we present in figure [ fig : full ] the spectrum extracted for the entire group ( i.e. including the three neighboring galaxies and the shock ) .",
    "the total h@xmath5  line emission from the whole group exceeds @xmath8 and is still the most dominant mir coolant .",
    "indeed the luminosity of the rotational h@xmath5  lines is sufficient that it could be detected at high redshift with future far - infrared or sub - mm instrumentation like spica or safir ( see appleton et al .",
    "how likely is it , however , that high - speed shocks play a role in the assembly of galaxies ?",
    "there is growing evidence that galaxies at high redshift are turbulent @xcite and increasingly clumpy ( e.g. conselice et al .",

    "indeed bournaud & elmegreen ( 2009 ) discuss the importance of the growth instabilities in massive gas clumps in forming disks at z  @xmath88  1 , and favor at least a large fraction of the clump systems being formed in smooth flows , perhaps similar to those discussed by dekel et al .",
    "to what extent the build - up of these disks is truly `` smooth '' is not yet clear since the medium is likely to be a multiphase one . in a more standard picture , gas flowing into the more massive dark halos will experience strong shocks , most likely in an inhomogenious medium ( e. g. greif et al .",
    "2008 )  thus it begs the question of how important h@xmath9 cooling may be in these different cases .",
    "models of the collapse of the first structures predict that strong metal lines soon dominate the cooling over molecular hydrogen when the first stars pollute the environment .",
    "it is therefore usually assumed that , except at very early stages , molecular hydrogen is a minority coolant in gas that forms the first major structures ( e.g. bromm et al .",
    "2001 , santoro and shull 2006 ) .",
    "however , our observations show that , under the right conditions , even in high metallicity environments , molecular hydrogen can be extremely powerful  in this case dominating by a factor of ten over the usually powerful @xmath10siii@xmath1134.82 \\mu$]m line in strong shocks .",
    "if there are situations at high redshift where strong shocks propagate into a clumpy , multiphase medium , then our observations imply that molecular hydrogen cooling can not be assumed to be negligible . on the other hand",
    ", this will not be a trivial problem .",
    "our best model of stephan s quintet @xcite involves the formation of h@xmath5  in a complex multiphase turbulent medium in which shocks destroy dust in some places , but allow survival in others - thus encouraging h@xmath5  formation .    in the early universe , this enhanced cooling ,",
    "which has so far been neglected , will depend on the distribution and nature of the first dust grains , in concert with the formation , temperature and abundance of gas , and the feedback effects from the first stars and agn .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of the mid - infrared spectral mapping of the stephan s quintet system using the _ spitzer space telescope_. we highlight here our five main conclusions :    * the powerful h@xmath5  emission detected by @xcite surprisingly represents only a small fraction of the group - wide warm h@xmath5  ( with a lower limit luminosity of @xmath89 spread over @xmath90 kpc@xmath7 ) that dominates the mid - infrared emission of the system .",
    "there is evidence for another shock - excited feature , the so - called h@xmath5  bridge between the main shock and ngc 7319 , which is likely a remnant of past tidal interactions within the group .",
    "the spatial variation in the distribution of the h@xmath5  0 - 0 line ratios implies differences in temperature and excitation in the shocked system - this will be explored fully in paper ii . *",
    "the global l(h@xmath5)/l@xmath91 ratio in the main shock is @xmath92 , and @xmath62.5 in the new `` bridge '' feature .",
    "the results confirm that mir h@xmath9 lines are a stronger coolant than x - ray emission over the shock structures , indicating a new cooling pathway seen on a large scale in sq .",
    "this modifies the traditional view that x - rays dominate cooling at all times in the later stages of compact group evolution . since h@xmath5  forms on the surfaces of dust grains , we expect dust emission associated with these regions , but a low intensity radiation field produces only weak emission at 24 .",
    "* following earlier interpretations of nebular line ratios in the optical , we interpret infrared ionic lines within the framework of fast ( @xmath93 km@xmath0 ) ionizing shocks .",
    "comparison between the @xmath10neii@xmath11 $ ] , @xmath10neiii@xmath11 $ ] , @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] and @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] line intensities implies that both silicon and iron are depleted onto dust .",
    "this result implies that dust is not destroyed in the shock .",
    "* star formation in sq is dominated by sq - a and 7318b - south , located at the extreme ends of the shock ridge seen at radio wavelengths , suggesting they are both shock triggered starbursts .",
    "however , regions dominated by warm h@xmath5  emission exhibit very low star formation rates , consistent with a turbulent model where h@xmath5  is significantly reheated and cool clouds are too short - lived or undersized to collapse . * in sq we observe the projected coexistence of @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] and h@xmath5 being produced by @xmath6200km@xmath0 and @xmath620km@xmath0 velocity shocks , respectively .",
    "our observational results are consistent with a model of a multiphase postshock medium produced by a galaxy - wide collision @xcite .",
    "the cooling pathway of warm h@xmath5  emission we observe group - wide in sq is clearly a significant , albeit surprising , mechanism in shock systems . to determine the overall dominant cooling mechanism in sq",
    ", we require an inventory of lines and continuum processes at all wavelengths . early shock models @xcite predict that , apart from the rotational emission from h@xmath5 , contributions from lines such as @xmath10oi@xmath11$]63.2 , @xmath10cii@xmath11$]157.7  and the thz spectrum of h@xmath50 @xcite could be significant .",
    "we hope to explore this chemistry more fully , and the detailed distribution of cool dust , using the capabilities of the _ herschel _ space observatory .",
    "in addition , we can not rule out strong uv line - cooling .",
