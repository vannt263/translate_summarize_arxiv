    "two of the simplest measures of how matter is distributed throughout the universe are its average density , parametrized by the ratio of the matter density to the critical density , @xmath6 , and its power spectrum @xmath8 .",
    "the amplitude of the power spectrum today is usually characterized by @xmath0 , the average rms mass fluctuation in spheres of @xmath9 .",
    "accurate determinations of both @xmath0 and @xmath6 are of crucial importance to cosmology as they provide some of the simplest probes of large scale structure .",
    "cluster abundances are well known for their ability to constrain both @xmath0 and @xmath6 ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this seems intuitively reasonable : the number of large massive objects ought to depend on the total mass available ( @xmath6 ) and a measure of how likely is it for mass to clump at cluster scales ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "more formally , from numerical simulations ( @xcite,@xcite ) and theoretical considerations ( @xcite , @xcite ) we know to a reasonable accuracy what the halo mass function looks like in various cosmologies . even though mass is not directly observable , by identifying a mass tracer and its relation to halo mass",
    "one may hope to constrain cosmology .",
    "some examples of mass tracers in clusters are x - ray temperatures and luminosities of the inter - cluster gas , optical luminosities , and the number of galaxies found in the cluster",
    ".    the actual analysis of data may be quite involved . in particular , not only is it necessary to understand how a mass tracer scales with halo mass , one also needs to understand both what the uncertainties in the scaling are and the intrinsic scatter around the mean relation between the mass tracer and halo mass ( see e.g. pierpaoli et al .",
    "@xcite , viana et al .",
    "@xcite for two recent , detailed analyses ) .    here",
    ", we develop simple expressions for the number density and bias of clusters binned using an arbitrary mass tracer .",
    "while much effort has been devoted to converting observations to the theoretically simple mass function , here we attempt to massage the theory to fit the observations : i.e. use the halo model to make predictions for any experiment .",
    "we attempt to include many of the most relevant experimental effects , including intrinsic scatter in the mass tracer , scatter and/or bias arising from experimental measurements , and imperfect detection rates and false detections .",
    "we feel this is important since it allows direct comparison of theory to data : by minimizing the amount of data manipulation , the probability of artificially biasing the data is diminished .",
    "we also provide theoretical estimates of the correlation matrix between various bins .",
    "our estimates include poisson noise , sample variance , and uncertainties due to scatter in the scaling of the mass tracer with mass , the treatment of which we believe is new .    following the development of our formalism , we apply it to a model cluster catalogue that mimics the type of catalogues one can construct from large optical surveys such as the sdss @xcite or the 2df @xcite . for concreteness , we take the mass tracer to be the number of member galaxies in a cluster .",
    "this has the interesting consequence that we can analyze both cosmological constraints and constraints on how galaxies populate halos .    from the cosmological point of view ,",
    "our results are of importance since any new measurements of @xmath0 may help narrow the large range of measured values for this quantity .",
    "more importantly perhaps , our analysis identifies degeneracies between cosmology and the halo occupation distribution .",
    "not only is this an interesting problem in itself ( see e.g. zheng et al .",
    "@xcite , berlind & weinberg @xcite ) , but the identification of degeneracies in our survey suggests that , in general , there will be degeneracies between cosmology and the mass tracer scaling relation . said degeneracies may help bring into agreement seemingly conflicting results for @xmath0 obtained with different assumptions of the mass tracer scaling relation .    from the point of view of constraining galaxy formation , determining both cosmology and the halo occupation distribution simultaneously is important since it avoids possible systematic errors that may arise from the choice of an incorrect cosmology ( again coming back to the question of degeneracies ) .",
    "further , we believe that considering cluster abundances and large scale bias has the important advantage that neither halo profiles nor second order moments of the halo occupation distribution appear in our formulae explicitly .",
    "this makes our results very insensitive to said variables , thereby providing a first stepping stone toward the full determination of the halo occupation distribution .",
    "in particular , this type of analysis should complement well halo occupation constraints from galaxy clustering ( see e.g. jing , mo , and brner @xcite , scoccimarro et al .",
    "@xcite , moustakas and somerville @xcite , cooray @xcite ) , as well as more sophisticated studies of halo occupancy such as work based on the conditional luminosity function ( see yang , mo and van den bosch @xcite and van den bosch , mo , and yang @xcite ) .    in section 2",
    ", we develop our formalism and find expressions for the number density and bias of clusters binned according to measurements of an arbitrary mass tracer . in section 3 we identify the various sources of uncertainty intrinsic to observations , i.e. uncertainties that would exist even for a perfect experiment . in section 4 ,",
    "we show how to include various experimental effects both in the predictions for what will be observed and in the uncertainties associated with the data .",
    "having finished our formalism , we present in section 5 the assumptions for our model survey and characteristics of the assumed cluster catalogue .",
    "these are supposed to mimic the real catalogues which one may expect to construct with surveys such as the sdss and 2df .",
    "section 5 sets up our fiducial model and states all assumptions used to obtain our results , which are presented in section 6 .",
    "section 7 addresses how the results change if we do not have bias information and consider cluster abundances alone .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 8 . also included as",
    "an appendix is a more thorough discussion of what is usually called the cluster abundance normalization condition ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) than the one presented in the main text .",
    "the halo model is a theoretical framework developed to understand clustering properties of different mass tracers in the universe .",
    "the halo model does this by dividing the problem in two : first , it assumes all mass in the universe is distributed in units called halos .",
    "the halo model then assumes that all properties of mass tracers within a halo ( e.g. galaxies , x - ray temperature , etc . )",
    "are determined exclusively by the physical properties of the parent halo ( e.g. mass , angular momentum , and so on ) .",
    "let then @xmath12 be our mass tracer , e.g. x - ray temperature / luminosity , optical luminosity , or number of member galaxies",
    ". we will be interested in the clustering properties of halos as a function of the tracer @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in the density and bias of halos for an arbitrary binning criterion @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , one may wish to bin clusters by specifying the maximum and minimum values @xmath12 may take for a cluster to be included in a specific bin .",
    "this corresponds to a top - hat selection function @xmath14 when @xmath15 and @xmath16 otherwise .",
    "since we will be interested in medium and large mass halos , we will be using the terms halos , groups , and clusters interchangeably .",
    "let us write then the cluster density in the halo model formalism .",
    "let the @xmath17 halo be located at position @xmath18 and let @xmath19 be the value of the mass tracer @xmath12 for that particular halo .",
    "then the density of objects where @xmath12 is larger than some specified minimum value @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where the sum is over all halos .",
    "here , @xmath22 is the usual step function , i.e. @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 otherwise , so that a halo contributes to the density if and only if @xmath26 .",
    "alternatively , one may be interested in some other selection criteria , e.g. looking at objects with @xmath27 , characterized by a top - hat function as discussed above",
    ". let @xmath28 represent an arbitrary window function used to bin data , where @xmath29 contains the parameters that specify the binning .",
    "in this case , the above expression becomes @xmath30 where the superscript @xmath31 is meant to signify that this is the true density of objects in our bin : i.e what we would observe with perfect instruments .",
    "systematic effects brought about by observations may lead to an observed density @xmath32 .",
    "we fold these into our formalism in  4 .",
    "we now make use of the ergodic hypothesis , and assume that the spatial clustering statistics of any field are identical to those obtained upon averaging the corresponding expressions over a hypothetical ensemble of universes .",
    "using @xmath33 to denote ensemble average , and an over bar @xmath34 to denote spatial averaging , we expect the spatially averaged cluster density to be : @xmath35    in order to obtain expectation values , one needs to know then the probability distribution for @xmath19 .",
    "we make the standard assumption that the value of the observable @xmath12 for a halo of mass @xmath36 is a random variable with a probability distribution @xmath37 depending only on the mass @xmath36 of the halo . for instance",
    ", the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in clusters allows one to relate the observed x - ray temperature to the mass of the cluster .",
    "likewise , simulations seem to indicate that the number of galaxies @xmath38 in a halo of mass @xmath36 is relatively insensitive to environment , so that @xmath39 depends only on @xmath36 @xcite,@xcite .    writing @xmath40 , where @xmath12 is a random variable for each mass value @xmath41 , we can rewrite the expression above as : @xmath42 notice that is only because we are assuming that @xmath12 is independent of cosmology that we can take @xmath43 out of the ensemble average above , and consider its average value over the halo occupation distribution alone .",
    "we now define the quantity @xmath44 which represents the true halo density field , the spatial average of which is called the halo mass function @xmath45 .",
    "we obtain then that the number density of groups in a bin @xmath29 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is meant to be the average value of @xmath48 over the probability distribution @xmath37 .      following an argument similar to the one above we may obtain an expression for the cluster - cluster correlation function @xmath49 between objects in bins @xmath29 and @xmath50 ( here @xmath51 ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the halo correlation function between halos of different masses @xmath36 and @xmath54 separated by distance @xmath55 .",
    "the upper script @xmath31 on @xmath56 serves here again to remind us that this is the true cluster correlation function .",
    "the observed correlation function may differ from @xmath56 due to systematics effects in the observations , to be included later . from our discussion concerning the average cluster density , we already know how to handle @xmath57 and @xmath45 .",
    "the only term in the above expression which is new is @xmath58 .",
    "the halo model provides a prescription to relate @xmath59 , the halo overdensity , to the matter overdensity . this same prescription relates the halo correlation function to the linear correlation function .",
    "to first order in perturbation theory , one obtains ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the linear bias @xcite since the expression depends on the average halo mass function @xmath45 rather than @xmath62 . ] .",
    "here @xmath63 is the critical overdensity needed for collapse , @xmath64 ; @xmath65 and @xmath66 come from fitting to @xmath38-body simulations ; and @xmath67 , with @xmath68 being the tophat filtered rms fluctuations in the linear density field .",
    "the radius @xmath69 of the top - hat filter used in defining @xmath70 is obtained by demanding that a sphere of radius @xmath69 encompasses a total mass @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath71 , with @xmath72 the critical density of the universe .    in this limit ,",
    "the halo - halo correlation function becomes @xmath73 and thus the cluster - cluster correlation function simplifies to : @xmath74 where @xmath75 not surprisingly , we see that the cluster - cluster correlation function traces the underlying mass correlation function .",
    "it is worth pointing out that observationally the power spectra of galaxies and clusters are seen to have the same shape but different amplitude on scales @xmath76 mpc or larger , so that the simple scale - independent linear bias is indeed feasible on large scales @xcite ( in fact , it is necessarily so for guassian fields @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss now three intrinsic uncertainties associated with our observables : poisson errors , sample variance , and uncertainties due to intrinsic scatter in the mass - tracer to mass scaling relation . keeping an eye on our choice of model survey in ",
    "v , we assume a volume limited sample such that all objects of interest ( i.e. all halos with @xmath12 in the range of interest ) are detected . further , we assume no contamination of the sample , and a perfect instrument so that the observed value @xmath77 of the mass tracer always matches the true value @xmath78 . experimental bias and scatter are treated in ",
    "the first type of uncertainty is the poisson error in the number of clusters found . assuming no intrinsic clustering , the variance in the density of clusters is simply given by @xmath79 .",
    "this contribution to the correlation matrix is therefore @xmath80 note the use of the symbol @xmath81 for the correlation matrix .",
    "we include a @xmath82 above the @xmath83 to identify it as the  intrinsic \" correlation matrix , meaning that no observational effects have been taken into account .",
    "there is also a poisson term in the bias arising from the estimation of the clustering properties with a finite number of galaxies ( namely the secon term in equation 34 ) which is treated later on to properly account for contamination and completeness .",
    "in addition to this , hu and kravtsov showed that sample variance becomes increasingly important as we probe lower and lower mass scales @xcite in the halo mass function .",
    "we rederive here the result for sample variance found in hu and kravtsov , to use it as a reference for deriving the sample variance errors involving bias .",
    "assuming we have averaged over @xmath37 ( uncertainties associated with this probability are derived below ) , the sample variance contribution to the density - density correlation matrix is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the survey s window function .",
    "note we do not include terms proportional to simultaneous deviations from the mean due to sample variance and the variance of @xmath86 due to @xmath37 as these would yield only small corrections .",
    "we approximate @xmath85 above to be a spherical top - hat function encompassing a volume equal to that of the survey volume .",
    "the matrix element can now be easily computed by replacing @xmath62 in the above expressions with @xmath87 where @xmath88 . since @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    ", we obtain then @xmath91 where @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 .",
    "this is the final result that we were looking for , namely an expression for the covariance matrix between the number of objects found in each bin due to sample variance .",
    "the total density - density correlation matrix is obtained then by adding the sample variance matrix and the poisson noise .",
    "let us now turn towards matrix elements involving bias . as before , the sample variance contribution is @xmath94 again , we replace @xmath62 by @xmath87 and @xmath95 by @xmath96 .",
    "to get an expression for @xmath97 , we generalize eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) to unbarred @xmath98 and @xmath99 , so that @xmath100 where the second equality holds to leading order in @xmath101 .",
    "hence @xmath102    with this result , the sample variance contribution to @xmath103 may be written as @xmath104 where @xmath105    in exactly the same way we obtain the bias - bias terms of the correlation matrix , which are given by @xmath106      by mass tracer dispersion errors we mean the uncertainties in the density and bias of objects in a given bin @xmath29 due to the fact that @xmath12 is not uniquely determined by @xmath36 , i.e. uncertainties due to the probability distribution @xmath37 .",
    "note these are somewhat analogous to poisson uncertainties in the number of galaxies in a spatial bin .",
    "not surprisingly , then , the uncertainties take on a form @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the volume of the survey .",
    "consider then a realization of the halo model .",
    "given the survey volume @xmath108 , the number density of objects in bin @xmath29 in one realization may be written as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the number of halos in the mass bin @xmath41 .",
    "the mass binning must be chosen small enough so that at most one halo is found in any given mass bin .",
    "this ensures @xmath19 is a random variable for each halo ( i.e. that @xmath19 and @xmath111 are uncorrelated for any two halos @xmath112 ) .",
    "we have then @xmath113 we have used above that @xmath114 and @xmath115 are not correlated , and that @xmath116 ( since @xmath117 ) .",
    "we may write a similar expression for @xmath118 , @xmath119 so upon subtracting eq .",
    "( [ eq : nbartwo ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nbarone ] ) , we find @xmath120 where @xmath121    but note that @xmath122 is just the average number density of halos in a bin of mass @xmath41 . averaging over many realizations , we have @xmath123 and hence @xmath124    in the continuum limit , we obtain our final answer , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is given by equation ( [ varpsi ] ) .",
    "if the binning function satisfies @xmath127 ( e.g. non - overlapping top - hat bins ) equation ( [ varpsi ] ) simplifies to @xmath128 our expression for the contribution to the correlation matrix from @xmath37 makes sense .",
    "if @xmath37 is very narrow , then a given mass @xmath36 will always get assigned to one and only bin @xmath29 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath129 , and eq .  ( [ eq : cpsi ] ) shows that the correlation matrix vanishes .",
    "that is , if the mass tracer is perfect , then there is no uncertainty associated with it . in the more realistic case , a mass @xmath36",
    "will sometimes be assigned to more than one bin . then , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cpsi ] ) would be non - zero even if @xmath130 this would lead then to an anti - correlation between these two bins . because of the leakage into adjoining bins , @xmath131 and the diagonal term in @xmath132 also becomes nonzero .",
    "what about density - bias terms",
    "? going back to equation ( [ bias ] ) , we can write the bias as @xmath133 a procedure analogous to the one before yields @xmath134 converting this into an integral , we get @xmath135 incidentally , note that the correlation matrix is still symmetric despite the appearance of a factor @xmath136 .",
    "the matrix element across the diagonal is @xmath137 , which also contains the same @xmath136 factor .",
    "all other terms in the expression are clearly symmetric .    finally , performing the same analysis yields the bias - bias contribution , given by @xmath138",
    "we have derived above expressions for the density and bias of halos binned according to an unspecified mass tracer @xmath12 , along with the related intrinsic uncertainties assuming a volume limited survey .",
    "we have , however , been assuming no contamination , @xmath139 rate detection ( completeness ) , and the ability to observe @xmath12 precisely .",
    "we wish to incorporate into our formalism uncertainties and systematic effects arising from observation . in particular , we assume observational effects may be characterized by the following information :    * the average detection rate ( completeness ) @xmath140 and its variance @xmath141 .",
    "@xmath140 is defined as the fraction of objects in bin @xmath29 which are identified . * the average false detection rate @xmath142 and its variance @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath142 is defined as the number of spurious objects per unit volume in bin @xmath29 . *",
    "the probability @xmath144 that a halo with observed @xmath12 has a true value @xmath145 .    note we made the simplifying assumption that both @xmath146 and @xmath147 are position independent , though it is straightforward ( albeit cumbersome ) to extend the formalism to include position dependent detection and contamination rates .",
    "we begin by incorporating detection and contamination rates into the formalism .",
    "further , since the true observable is not the density of objects but rather the number of objects in a given bin , we modify our formalism appropriately .",
    "given our assumptions , the number of objects identified in a volume limited survey takes the form @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the average number of objects in bin @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding correlation matrix is then ] terms involving products of correlation matrices are being ignored as second order terms . for the expression above , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 are all uncorrelated with each other and possess different probability distributions ( which is the case of interest here ) . ]",
    "@xmath152 where @xmath153 is the variance in the volume arising from uncertainties in the measured redshifts of the clusters .",
    "the result is just what one would expect : the uncertainties for a perfect algorithm @xmath154 are scaled by the detection factors .",
    "in addition , one adds the uncertainties due to imperfect knowledge of the detection and false detection rates .",
    "finally one needs to include the contribution from uncertainties in the sampled volume arising from redshift uncertainties .",
    "the expression above simplifies when the detection and contamination rates of different bins are uncorrelated , in which case one obtains    @xmath155    we wish to incorporate now systematic effects and/or uncertainties in the assigned cluster richness arising from the observations .",
    "in particular , we wish to include the fact that binning of data is done in terms of the _ observed value of @xmath12 rather than the true value @xmath145 .",
    "we view the observations as providing a random mapping @xmath156 where a value @xmath12 has a probability @xmath144 of occurring .",
    "the probability @xmath144 is assumed to be known from experimental calibrations .",
    "e.g. if we consider x - ray temperature measuremetns for a cluster , @xmath157 describes how a series of measuremnts @xmath158 of a cluster with temperature @xmath159 is distributed .",

    "any systematic effects and/or uncertainties introduced by the observations will automatically be taken into account in the convolution of @xmath144 and @xmath162 .",
    "note though that an application of our formalism requires an understanding of the probability @xmath144 , presumably characterized in the experiment s calibration .",
    "let us now turn our attention to bias .",

    "otherwise , there would be systematic corrections to equation ( [ obscorr ] ) due to the correlation functions of @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",

    "the clustering signal , however , does not depend on @xmath146 .",
    "this is not surprising , as @xmath146 changes only how many clusters we observe , but not their clustering properties . of course",
    ", a lower @xmath146 will lead to more noisy estimations of the bias ( see equation [ biaserrest ] ) .",
    "now that we have our expression for bias , we may compute the corresponding uncertainties . using equations ( [ obsna ] ) and ( [ obsba ] )",

    "the factor @xmath178 in front of @xmath103 scales the correlation matrix to the total number of real clusters as opposed to number density .",
    "the prefactor corresponds to the scaling from the true bias to the observed bias .",
    "finally , this same type of analysis gives us the bias - bias terms of the observable s correlation matrix , resulting in @xmath179    in addition to the errors above , there is a contribution coming from actually attempting to estimate bias from data . for instance , assuming the bias is measured using the power spectrum involves fourier space discretization .",
    "this , in turn , brings its own set of sample variance errors , as well as poisson errors in the number of objects found in a fourier pixel .",
    "the corresponding errors in the power spectrum estimation are given by ( see e.g.@xcite ) : @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the volume of the survey , and @xmath182 is the volume of the corresponding @xmath183-shell in fourier space .",

    ", we could replace the above expression in equation 22 and rederive the corresponding uncertainties as in the previous section .",
    "this would add terms proportional to @xmath193 , which may be neglected in the limit that @xmath193 goes to zero .",
    "we do not expect this effect to have major consequences in our results .",
    "let us then specify the characteristics of our hypothetical cluster finding algorithm .",
    "we will assume that the non - detection rate ( i.e. @xmath195 ) , the false detection rates , and their errors , are all power laws as a function of the number of galaxies in the cluster .",
    "thus , e.g. , the detection rate is taken to have the form @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath193 are constants .",
    "the normalization is specified by indicating their corresponding values for clusters with @xmath198 galaxies and clusters with @xmath199 galaxies , shown below , as well as the corresponding values @xmath197 and @xmath193 .",
    "figure [ decrates ] plots the corresponding rates .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      perhaps the most surprising result so far is that local cluster abundances alone are not capable of constraining either @xmath6 or @xmath0 very precisely when using reasonable priors for the richness - mass relation .",
    "this result , however , was obtained for optical cluster surveys , which amounts operationally to a choice of mass scale @xmath7 and power law index @xmath2 in the scaling of the mass tracer with halo mass .",
    "it is possible then that our conclusions do not hold in the case of x - ray surveys or other mass tracers , where one would have different values for @xmath7 and @xmath2 . here",
    ", we wish to investigate where the degeneracies stem from to determine whether we expect them to be generic or particular to the fiducial model we have assumed .",
    "let us begin by analyzing the @xmath200 degeneracy first .",
    "we concluded in section [ secm1om ] that as long as the mass tracer scales with mass as some function of @xmath201 for some characteristic mass scale @xmath7 , then the degeneracy between @xmath7 and @xmath6 will always exist .",
    "the only possible way out of this statement is that our starting assumption , namely equation [ start ] , is violated .",
    "we discuss then what conditions equation [ start ] imposes on the mass function .",
    "let us assume that equation [ start ] holds and consider the product @xmath202 for for two values @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "equation [ start ] implies @xmath205 provided @xmath206 . defining @xmath207",
    ", we obtain @xmath208 , which upon replacing on the right hand side above yields @xmath209    in other words , equation [ start ] holds if and only if the halo mass function satisfies the scaling relation @xmath210 letting @xmath211 , this relation simplifies to @xmath212 which was indeed found by zheng et al .",
    "@xcite using extensive numerical simulations in fact , they found the correlation function scales in a similar way , supporting the fact that the @xmath200 degeneracy we found is not broken when bias is included as an additional observable .",
    "we are forced to conclude then that there is an intrinsic limit to how well can we constrain @xmath6 from cluster abundances which is set by the uncertainty in the characteristic mass scale @xmath7 .",
    "mass measurements at present are only accurate to about @xmath213 ( optimistically ) to @xmath214 ( pessimistically ) , which essentially sets the maximum accuracy one could achieve in @xmath6 using local cluster surveys . note ,",
    "however , that we found that the ratio @xmath215 itself was rather poorly constrained , so it seems unlikely that local cluster abundances can provide strong constraints on @xmath6 .",
    "let us now turn to the @xmath216 degeneracy .",
    "we perform an analysis similar to the one above to determine if the degeneracy stems from a scaling property of the halo mass function .",
    "consider then a variation of @xmath217 which leaves cluster abundances fixed .",
    "the relation between the parameters is easily obtained from a singular value decomposition of the fisher matrix holding all parameters fixed except for @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain that cluster abundances are approximately degenerate when @xmath218 .",
    "now , since our mass tracer scales with mass as a power law , the binning functions may be expressed in terms of a function @xmath219 .",
    "we have then @xmath220    we perform now a change of variables by defining @xmath36 via @xmath221 . defining @xmath222 and replacing above we get    @xmath223    which is to be compared with",
    "@xmath224    if we demand that @xmath225 , we have then that @xmath226 , and thus by construction @xmath227 .",
    "since the function @xmath228 is the same in both equations [ comp1 ] and [ comp2 ] , this suggests that the kernel of the integrals are nearly degenerate .",
    "we thus make the ansatz    @xmath229    = 0.55    we check our ansatz using the sheth - tormen halo mass function .",
    "in particular , figure [ halomf1 ] shows the sheth - tormen halo mass function , computed for our fiducial model , as well as the scaled mass functions computed according to equation [ mfscaling ] . the smaller plot above shows the fractional difference between the right and left hand sides of equation [ mfscaling ] .",
    "the right hand side of equation [ mfscaling ] was computed for @xmath230 ( dashed line ) and @xmath231 ( dotted line ) .",
    "we find that our scaling relations are accurate to within @xmath232 for @xmath0 in the range @xmath233 $ ] and over the mass range @xmath234 .",
    "even though the accuracy of the scaling relations decreases as we move away from this range , it is still better than @xmath235 from @xmath236 up to @xmath237 for @xmath0 in the range @xmath238 .",
    "we conclude therefore that , in the mass ranges probed by our model , there appears to exist a scaling relation given by equation [ mfscaling ] .",
    "further , running the argument we used to derive our ansatz in reverse proves that the degeneracy we observe does indeed stem from the scaling relation [ mfscaling ] .",
    "we thus expect our results to hold for all mass tracers that scale with mass via a power law and which probe the mass range @xmath239 .",
    "in particular , we expect a degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath0 to exist for all cases ( though recall bias breaks this degeneracy ) as well as an @xmath200 degeneracy .",
    "this further implies that any determination of cosmological parameters done using local cluster abundances alone needs to be marginalized over uncertainties in how the mass tracer scales with mass , regardless of the choice of mass tracer .",
    "note marginalization over the hubble rate is also necessary due to large mixing between the cosmological parameters for fixed cluster densities .    to close , we note the fact that the scaling relation [ mfscaling ] depends on @xmath7 .",
    "this suggests that a more accurate degeneracy can be achieved by allowing @xmath215 to vary using for example equations [ egv1 ] and [ egv2 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the relation we obtained works well , and is only weakly dependent on the value of @xmath7 . indeed , we can change @xmath7 by up to a factor of two up or down and still get a reasonable agreement in the scaling relation [ mfscaling ] .",
    "it is likely therefore that the role of @xmath7 is essentially to set the mass scale over which the halo mass function will satisfy scalings of the form [ mfscaling ] .",
    "we have derived expressions for cluster abundances and bias using the halo model formalism . in particular ,",
    "we have shown how starting from the halo mass function and halo bias , we can obtain expressions for cluster statistics in terms of any mass tracer ( e.g. x - ray temperature / luminosity , number of galaxies , etc . ) in such a way that various experimental effects can be included in the formalism .",
    "specifically , we include intrinsic dispersion of the richness - mass relation , bias and/or scatter due to experimental measurements , detection rates , and false detections .",
    "we also identified various sources of errors and derived the uncertainties one expects due to intrinsic scatter in the richness - mass relation .",
    "we believe that these derivations are important in that they allow us to compare theory directly to observations , without having to manipulate the observations in attempts to retrieve , for instance , the halo mass function .",
    "further , they allow us to consider the possibility of using cluster statistics to constrain not just cosmology , but also how the mass tracer scales with halo mass .",
    "having derived our formalism , we applied it to the case of large local optical cluster surveys . in this context , we have shown that optical cluster survey determinations of cluster abundances and bias can provide strong constraints on the amplitude of the power spectrum at cluster scales ( @xmath0 ) , the power law index on the scaling relation of the number of galaxies in a halo of mass @xmath36 , and perhaps even the hubble parameter @xmath240 ( see table [ predictionstable ] ) .",
    "we argued as well that cluster abundances and bias are not well suited for constraining @xmath6 or @xmath7 , the amplitude of the mass tracer scaling relation with mass .",
    "we have shown as well that one needs to be very careful when analyzing cluster abundances and bias data in order to avoid overly optimistic constraints .",
    "in particular , we have shown that realistic constraints on @xmath0 need to be marginalized over @xmath240 and , when bias information is unavailable , marginalization over priors on @xmath2 is also necessary .",
    "though marginalization over @xmath7 has a much smaller effect on @xmath0 , it becomes of paramount importance if one wishes to constrain @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , we found that the uncertainties in @xmath0 and @xmath6 obtained from cluster abundance studies alone are entirely determined by the priors used on @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "we have attempted to explain why is it that the uncertainties in @xmath0 and @xmath6 are driven by the priors on @xmath2 and @xmath6 when only cluster abundance information is used . in particular , we have argued that this effect is driven by two degeneracies , one involving @xmath7 and @xmath6 , the other involving @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown here that these degeneracies arise from scaling laws satisfied by the halo mass functions .",
    "the scaling law leading to the @xmath200 degeneracy was found empirically by zheng et al .",
    "@xcite , but it is reassuring to see it re - emerge here in our fisher analysis .",
    "the scaling law [ mfscaling ] leading to the @xmath216 degeneracy is , to the best of our knowledge , a new result .",
    "finally , we argued that because the degeneracies above stem from intrinsic scaling relations of the halo mass function , our conclusions are valid for any cluster abundance study in which the mass tracer scales with mass as a power law to a good approximation . in particular , for any such studies , any constraints that one wishes to place on cosmology need to be properly marginalized over the hubble rate @xmath240 as well as the amplitude and power law index of the mass tracer scaling relation .    in summary ,",
    "then , we have found that cluster abundances and cluster bias are powerful tools that can greatly constrain both the amplitude of the power spectrum at cluster scales , and how the number of galaxies in a halo scales with mass . however , neither @xmath6 nor the characteristic mass scale for the formation of galaxies can be accurately constrained . in either case",
    ", it is always important to marginalize over @xmath240 in order to avoid obtaining unrealistically tight constraints .",

    "cosmological constraints from cluster abundance studies are usually expressed in the form of the so called cluster abundance normalization condition , usually expressed as @xmath242 where @xmath11 . in other words , cluster abundances",
    "are usually used to constrain the combination @xmath243 .",
    "this combination of parameters , however , did not arise from our analysis .",
    "where did the usual @xmath241 degeneracy go ?",
    "let us consider first equation [ egv1 ] .",
    "we stated in section [ what_abundances_tell_us ] that [ egv1 ] could be though of a generalized cluster abundance normalization condition .",
    "while the exponent of @xmath6 is a little steeper than usual , we show below that this arises simply because we are probing rather low mass scales .",
    "we begin our analysis by determining the @xmath244 confidence regions in the @xmath241 plane obtained using only our 10 richest bins ( clusters having 35 galaxies or @xmath245 ) while holding all parameters except @xmath0 and @xmath6 constant .",
    "this is shown in figure [ low_hmf ] with a dotted line .",
    "the degeneracy axis in the figure is @xmath246 , so we see then that we do indeed recover the cluster normalization condition when , a- we hold all other parameters fixed , and b- restrict ourselves to the most massive clusters .",
    "this degeneracy simply reflects the fact that the halo mass function at @xmath247 scales is degenerate according to the above expression ( see e.g. zheng et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on this basis",
    ", one would expect that probing low mass scales would allow us to break this degeneracy , which is indeed the case .",
    "we show this in figure [ low_hmf ] where we plot the confidence regions obtained when including lower mass clusters . in particular , the confidence regions shown with the dashed and solid lines in figure [ low_hmf ] are obtained using all but the lowest six bins ( @xmath248 or @xmath249 ) and all bins respectively .",
    "we see that with the inclusion of lower mass bins the degeneracy region is greatly reduced .",
    "further , as we probe lower and lower masses , the axis which is least strongly constrained becomes steeper and steeper , going from @xmath250 when only the 10 richest bins are used to @xmath251 when all bins are used .",
    "we can gain further insight on the @xmath241 degeneracy by considering what happens when we allow @xmath7 and @xmath2 to vary , but keeping @xmath240 fixed .",
    "the two most constrained directions are obtained from the estimated parameter correlation matrix are of the form @xmath252 in equation [ no2 ] . ]",
    "note that these two eigenvectors are _ not simply expressions [ egv1 ] and [ egv2 ] with @xmath240 held constant . to see how they are related ,",
    "it is best to pretend we know nothing about equations [ egv1 ] and [ egv2 ] while we analyze the above eigenvectors .",
    "we can then go back and see how the pair of eigenvectors [ egv1 ] and [ egv2 ] are related to [ no1 ] and [ no2 ] .",
    "_    let us then analyze the above eigenvectors , whose structure allows for a very simple interpretation .",
    "take @xmath2 and @xmath7 to be fixed .",
    "then , the first eigenvector becomes the cluster normalization condition @xmath254 , while the second eigenvector is almost entirely @xmath6 .",
    "since the low mass end of the halo mass function is essentially independent of @xmath6 , this suggests the first eigenvector is driven by the high mass end of the halo mass function only , while the second eigenvector is driven by the low mass end alone .",
    "indeed , the eigenvectors obtained when restricting ourselves to high mass bins ( clusters with @xmath255 galaxies or more ) are close to those above , except that we do not lose any constraining power for the first eigenvector , while the constraint on the second eigenvector is weakened by a factor of four .",
    "we conclude then that equation [ no1 ] may be thought of as the constraint arising from matching the high mass end of the halo mass function , while equation [ no2 ] arises from matching the low mass end .",
    "are the vectors [ no1 ] and [ no2 ] related to the vectors we found in section [ what_abundances_tell_us ] ? to approach this question ,",
    "we can consider what happens to the vectors [ no1 ] and [ no2 ] when we let @xmath240 vary .",
    "consider first what happens at a qualitative level : @xmath240 affects both the high mass end and the low mass end of the halo mass function . as such , we do not expect our eigenvectors to cleanly separate into matching one or the other end of the halo mass functions- they will mix .",
    "indeed , when we let @xmath240 vary , the first eigenvector becomes      where @xmath193 and @xmath257 depend on the lowest mass scale probed . e.g. @xmath258 when all bins are used ( as we found in section [ what_abundances_tell_us ] ) while @xmath259 when we use only rich clusters .",
    "we note several things : first , the vector [ gencon ] is essentially identical to @xmath260 when @xmath99 is held fixed .",
    "interestingly , though , the @xmath261 degeneracy no longer has the constant exponent @xmath262 .",
    "the variation of the exponent comes about because of the mixing of the constraints from the low and high mass ends of the halo mass function , and hence our result above compromises by giving us the most strongly constrained direction in the @xmath241 plane when all other parameters are held fixed .    what about the eigenvector from expression [ no2 ] ?",
    "since @xmath240 mixes the high and low mass end constrains , one may expect the eigenvector [ no2 ] not only to be drastically altered ( since it no longer represent the low mass end constraint ) , but also to be greatly weakened since the constraining power of the high and low mass ends of the halo mass function now goes into the first eigenvector .",
    "this is indeed the case . despite this result",
    ", however , there is still a second highly constrained eigenvector , which is essentially that of expression [ egv2 ] with @xmath99 fixed .",
    "this eigenvector is a new constrain that arises from allowing @xmath240 to vary , and is thus not associated with the eigenvector from expression [ no2 ] .",
    "we argued throughout the text that the appearance of the @xmath216 and @xmath200 degeneracies makes marginalization over the mass tracer scaling relation necessary if one wishes to avoid placing overly optimistic constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "a by product of this marginalization is that the characteristic shape of the @xmath241 degeneracy is then completely washed out .",
    "we illustrate this effect below , not only to observe the degradation of the confidence regions , but also because we can get a better feel as to how important the various effects are .",
    "we begin with the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath6 when all other parameters are fixed .",
    "this is shown in figure [ s8_om2 ] as the inner solid ellipse ( @xmath244 confidence region ) , which matches that of figure [ low_hmf ] .",
    "we now let @xmath2 and @xmath7 to vary by assuming gaussian priors @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "this is shown as a dashed curve in figure [ s8_om2 ] .",
    "the effect of allowing @xmath2 and @xmath7 to vary is staggering- the confidence regions are enormously expanded .",
    "we can likewise observe the effect of allowing @xmath240 to vary while keeping the other parameters fixed .",
    "figure [ s8_om2 ] shows the @xmath244 confidence regions ( dotted line ) marginalized over @xmath240 with a gaussian prior @xmath265 .",
    "as we expect , one direction remains tightly constrained , corresponding to the eigenvector [ egv2 ] , the generalized cluster abundance normalization condition . on the other hand ,",
    "the perpendicular direction is weakened to a large degree , again reflecting that a floating @xmath240 mixes the high and low mass ends constraints from the halo mass function into a single constraint .",
    "finally , shown with the outer solid curve in figure [ s8_om2 ] is the @xmath244 confidence region when @xmath266 and @xmath240 are allowed to vary using the above priors .",
    "this last curve is the true constraint one may expect from cluster abundances alone .",
    "also shown as reference with the thicker solid curve is the @xmath244 confidence region obtained including bias information .",
    "all priors for this last curve are the same , except for @xmath2 , for which no prior was assumed ."

    "<S> we find cluster abundances and bias are not well suited for constraining @xmath6 or the amplitude @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that without bias information @xmath0 and @xmath2 are degenerate , implying constraints on the former are strongly dependent on priors used for the latter and vice - versa . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy stems from an intrinsic scaling relation of the halo mass function , and hence it should be present regardless of the mass tracer used in the survey . </S>"
