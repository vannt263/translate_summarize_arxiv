    "reaction - diffusion problems of diffusing entities are of great interest in a broad range of physical systems in physics , chemistry , and biology , and have been typically studied under the assumption that , in the absence of the the reaction phenomenon , the motion is translationally invariant  @xcite .",
    "our interest in the present paper is to extend these studies fundamentally by going beyond that assumption .",
    "we analyze systems in which a particle diffuses in a harmonic potential and undergoes capture at a given rate when it arrives at a fixed trap .",
    "the diffusion means that the particle performs a random walk .",
    "the attraction to the potential center means that a tendency to be tethered to a fixed point is present in addition .",
    "the location of the trap is generally arbitrary .",
    "e.g. , not necessarily at the attractive center ; this feature introduces interesting variety in the consequences of the reaction - diffusion phenomenon .",
    "systems characterized by the above features occur often in nature .",
    "molecular forces confine moving entities in various physical and chemical situations in sensitized luminescence and photosynthesis . funneling phenomena",
    "attract excitations in photosynthetic antennae and molecular crystals and aggregates .",
    "particle diffusion in a harmonic field occurs also in biophysical studies on dna stretching with optical tweezers  @xcite .",
    "yet another relevant area is electrostatic steering in enzyme ligand binding  @xcite .",
    "to bind at an enzymes active site , a ligand must diffuse or be transported to the enzyme surface , and , if the binding site is buried , the ligand must diffuse through the protein to reach it .",
    "enhancement of this diffusion can be achieved by attractive electrostatic interactions between the substrate and the protein binding site . on a more macroscopic scale",
    ", animals feel a driving force pointing towards their _ nest _",
    "@xcite with the consequent emergence of home ranges  @xcite .",
    "transmission of infection in terrains where infected animals ( such as rodents ) interact with susceptible ones under the action of space confinement provides a related and more complex area of study .    depending on the relative position of the attractive center and the trap ,",
    "a particle placed initially at some location may be affected _ either _ favorably _ or _ unfavorably during different stages of its motion as far as the efficiency of the trapping phenomenon is concerned . in a translationally invariant system",
    "all that is relevant is the initial distance between the particle and reactive site , the manner of motion that occurs in between , and the rate at which the reaction occurs .",
    "the problem is rendered considerably richer in the presence of an attractive potential as we shall see below .",
    "our study of the literature has uncovered no major previous advances in reaction - diffusion theory in the presence of a potential .",
    "of the two relevant articles we have found , refs . @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the former has no position - dependence in the capture which is trivially represented via a constant term , the emphasis being on anomalous diffusion , and in the latter , only perfect absorption is treated and that only for a centrally located trap , which , as we shall show below , results in a relatively featureless case .",
    "thus , a general understanding of the situation is not available in the literature .",
    "this has motivated us to undertake the present investigation .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the rest of this section",
    "we specify the smoluchowski equation as the basic equation of motion that we start with , in the absence of capture . in section 2 ,",
    "we show how the survival probability depends on the propagators of the equation of motion in general , and give explicit expressions for the propagators of the smoluchowski equation .",
    "the combination of these two results is the point of departure of our analysis in the subsequent sections in the paper .",
    "section 3 treats the simple case of a centrally placed trap for which we obtain an _ analytic _ solution in the laplace domain , involving the whittaker function .",
    "analytic inversion is possible for perfect absorption but finite capture rates necessitate numerical inversion of the laplace transform expression .",
    "some exact results are presented for delocalized initial distributions of the particle in the case of perfect absorption . to study arbitrary capture rate",
    "we employ a numerical inversion of the laplace transform and verify the calculations through a direct numerical procedure from the partial differential equation consisting of the smoluchowski equation augmented by the localized capture term .",
    "the direct numerical procedure is explained in the appendix .",
    "the advantage of the work reported in section 3 is the explicit analytic ( whittaker function ) expression we provide and well as various analytically obtained time dependences ; its disadvantage is that it leads to generally predictable observations with little surprise .",
    "by contrast , section 4 uncovers interesting phenomena that depend on the relative location of the trap and the attractive center .",
    "there , on the basis of a numerical study , we provide analysis for several different locations of the trap and particle and discover an effect which is perhaps non - intuitive . in section 5",
    "we present two additional approaches to the problem .",
    "one is through consideration of a _ transfer rate _",
    "we specially define for the purpose at hand , following developments in exciton dynamics theory  @xcite . the other , which presupposes as an approximation that the parameters of the system are such that the equilibrium smoluchowski distribution is attained quickly , describes the capture efficiency as dependent on that equilibrium distribution .",
    "several new insights into the physics of reaction - diffusion phenomena in the presence of a potential become clear in sections 4 and 5 . in section 6",
    "we present concluding remarks .",
    "our point of departure in the _ absence of the capture term _ is a generalization of the diffusion equation , viz . , the smoluchowski equation , that has the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the probability to find the particle at position @xmath2 and time @xmath3 .",
    "the diffusion constant is @xmath4 , the rate at which the particle tends to return to the potential center ( taken to be the origin without loss of generality ) is @xmath5 .",
    "the propagator of this equation , i.e. , the solution for @xmath6 , to be denoted by the symbol @xmath7 , can be obtained by fourier transforming the equation and solving the resulting first order partial differential equation by the method of characteristics .",
    "see , e.g. ,  @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a function of time given by @xmath10 the solution shows transparently that , wherever it is initially placed , the particle tends to move to the origin at rate @xmath5 but , as a result of the diffusion that it also undergoes , ends up , in the steady state , occupying a gaussian of width proportional to the square root of the ratio of the diffusion constant to @xmath5 .",
    "we are generally interested in the particle survival probability @xmath11 when a term involving the capture parameter @xmath12 is appended to the smoluchowski equation to represent capture of the particle at the point @xmath13 : @xmath14 the use of the standard defect technique  @xcite yields the probability density in the laplace domain ( tildes denote the laplace transform and @xmath15 is the laplace variable ) , @xmath16 where @xmath17 integrating this expression over all space , one obtains the laplace - domain result for the survival probability for arbitrary initial conditions : @xmath18 .",

    "this is expected .",
    "for instance , one might argue that , if the initial location of the particle lies in between the potential center and the trap , the pull provided by the confining potential would tend to act counter to the phenomenon of trapping and that the potential would thus hinder trapping and enhance survival . yet , since at equilibrium , the particle in the trap - less situation would tend to occupy an extent around the potential center given by the smoluchowski width , one might expect survival , when the trap is present , to depend on whether the distance of the trap from the potential center is disparate with respect to the smoluchowski width .",
    "which effect takes over in a given set of circumstances ?",
    "these interesting situations are difficult , or even generally impossible , to study via analytic solutions . to investigate them , the straightforward way is to use a numerical program that starts with eq .",

    "the survival probability @xmath56 is given by the well - known expression ( [ tomdickharry ] ) valid for a diffusion rather than a smoluchowski equation , with @xmath58 replaced by @xmath84 .",
    "let us now introduce a potential with its attractive center precisely midway between the trap and the particle ( the potential center is at @xmath63 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]a , and examine the time dependence of the survival probability as the potential steepness measured by @xmath5 , or more conveniently the dimensionless ratio @xmath85 , is varied .",

    "the survival probability is given by eq .",
    "( [ tomdickharry ] ) , we see that increase of potential steepness , equivalently of @xmath85 , has a remarkable non - monotonic effect .",
    "small increase makes capture more efficient but beyond a certain value it has the opposite effect .",
    "why does this happen ?",
    "the presence of a potential surely makes the particle move faster , at least initially , towards the trap as it travels to the attractive center .",
    "however , past the attractive center , the motion towards the trap is uphill and therefore _ hindered _ by the potential .",
    "the introduction of the potential thus has both a favorable and an unfavorable effect on capture .",
    "there is an approximate but instructive way to think about what is happening by comparing where the trap lies in relation to the smoluchowski width .",
    "the potential pull tends to bring the probability density at the trap location to its equilibrium value in the absence of the capture .",
    "the dependence of this value ( indeed the value at any location which is not the potential center ) on the steepness of the potential is non - monotonic .",
    "this will become quantitatively clear in section 5 , eq .",

    "the trap is at the potential center in the left panel but uphill in the right panel ( initial particle location being at the potential center in this case ) .",
    "the effect of increasing the potential steepness is monotonic in the former but displays interesting features as in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] in the latter . ]",
    "let us now place the trap at the center and the particle placed initially uphill at some distance @xmath83 .",
    "this means @xmath28 and @xmath90 .",
    "nothing particularly interesting emerges as a potential is introduced ( with attractive center at the origin , as earlier ) and its steepness is varied : steeper potentials make trapping easier . on the other hand , if we reverse the positions of the trap and the particle , so that @xmath91 and @xmath39 , interesting non - monotonic behavior is met with again with variation in potential steepness .",

    "[ fig : figure3 ] , the time taken by the particle to traverse the distance from its initial placement to the trap under purely diffusive condition .",
    "why is there no symmetry in the effects of the placement of the stationary trap and the moving particle ?",
    "after all , survival probability depends merely on their meeting .",
    "the answer is obvious .",
    "a particle placed uphill with the trap at the potential center is always helped by the potential steepness to get faster to the trap . the curves in the left panel of fig .",

    "laplace inversion programs sometimes have the reputation of being inaccurate if the corresponding time - dependent function possesses oscillations .",
    "the cases we have examined do not show this feature .",
    "nevertheless , it is helpful to develop a method to simplify the analysis and perform calculations without ( numerical ) inversion of laplace transforms .",
    "such a method has been previously applied by one of the present authors in the study of exciton transport in molecular crystals  @xcite and proceeds through the definition of a transfer rate @xmath93 from the host system in which the particle moves to the trap .",
    "we describe it below .",
    "if the survival probability were an exponential in time , i.e. , @xmath94 the transfer rate would be given precisely by @xmath95 .",

    "the large time values of the decay rate , displayed as the horizontal asymptotes in the plot , show the non - monotonicity effect .",
    "the purpose of this paper has been the construction of a reaction diffusion theory , explicitly in 1-d , but generalizable to higher dimensions , for random walkers moving under an attractive harmonic potential .",

    "then , through a comparison of the discretization method to the laplace method we have shown to latter to be reliable and have used it throughout the rest of the paper .",
