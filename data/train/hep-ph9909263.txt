    "the bfkl equation has been widely used to study the inclusive or semi - inclusive observables measured at hera ( structure functions , diffractive structure functions ) in the small-@xmath4 ( large @xmath5 ) kinematical region @xcite .",
    "it is an evolution equation for the gluon density and was written and solved at leading-@xmath6 level ( llx ) @xcite and at next - to - leading accuracy ( nllx ) @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will be concerned with the llx kernel , which exhibits an interesting property : in the space of the transverse positions @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the evolved gluons , it was shown to be invariant under the global conformal transformations @xcite .",
    "hence the general solution of the bfkl equation can be written as a sum over the kernel eigenfunctions corresponding to the irreducible representations of the symmetry group @xmath9 .",
    "the latter are indexed by two indices , one of them being the ( discrete ) conformal spin @xmath10 , the other one the ( continuous ) real parameter @xmath11 . the dominant energy behaviour is a power - like rise of the amplitude @xmath12 , where the intercept value @xmath13 usually quoted is given by the @xmath2 component .",
    "however , the phenomenological relevance of the higher - spin components ( @xmath14 ) was suggested in ref.@xcite . in that paper , it is shown that the @xmath3 components appearing through the bfkl resummation can mimic the _",
    "soft pomeron_. indeed , this component exhibits effectively the right energy dependence of the soft pomeron and reproduces well its `` higher - twist '' behaviour at moderate and large @xmath15 pointed out by donnachie and landshoff @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a number of points of the conjecture were left untested . in particular , only a phenomenological expression for the coupling of the photon impact - factor to the higher - spin components was used . moreover ,",
    "the non - forward behaviour was not considered for lack of a precise knowledge of the relevant coupling at the photon vertex .",
    "recently , much efforts have been devoted to the study of the photon impact - factor in the transition @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "its coupling to the llx bfkl pomeron was computed but only for @xmath2 .",
    "we propose in this paper to extend these calculations to @xmath3 .",
    "the odd components are automatically zero by symmetry .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the @xmath17 ones are zero .",
    "this might be due to the fact that the coupling of two spin-1 photons selects conformal spins smaller or equal to 2 @xcite .",
    "we provide the explicit expressions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( see eq.([eq : n2 ] ) and subsequent equations ) .",
    "the general framework of our calculation is presented in section * 2*. the calculation appears in some details in section * 3*. to keep it readable , the most technical point are outlined in the four appendices * a*-*d * where we show the evaluation of a particular generalized hypergeometric @xmath18 function .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions and suggest outlooks .",

    "if furthermore the object @xmath20 is a proton , this process models diffractive photon production at hera with a large rapidity gap generated by the bfkl resummation . if @xmath20 is also a photon , we have access to @xmath27 physics .",

    "@xmath20 reads @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the appropriate colour factor corresponding to the process under consideration , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the well - known eigenvalue of the leading - order bfkl kernel : @xmath33 the scale @xmath34 is undetermined at llx .",
    "the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the `` vertex functions '' , i.e. the impact factors @xmath37 projected on the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath1 of the bfkl kernel : @xmath38 where @xmath23 is the impact - factor , and @xmath39 the convenient notations @xmath40 and @xmath41 have been introduced in the previous equation .",
    "we work with complexified transverse vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this impact - factor @xmath37 was computed in ref.@xcite by evaluating the relevant feynman graphs ( one of these graphs is depicted in fig.*2 * ) .",
    "two cases were distinguished . either the initial off - shell photon scatters into a real photon of same helicity , or the helicity undergoes a flip .",
    "it was argued that the longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon does not contribute at llx .",
    "let us recast the obtained expressions in the following form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the expressions for the function @xmath49 and the exponent @xmath50 depend on the helicity . for the helicity - conserving processes @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in the helicity - flip case , @xmath55 , @xmath56 for the @xmath57 transition and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",

    "one inserts the expression for @xmath1 in eq.([eq : i2 ] ) and one takes the mellin representation of the bessel function : @xmath70 where the contour of integration is parallel to the @xmath71-axis and @xmath72 .",
    "the changes of variable @xmath73 and @xmath74 enable to reduce one of the \\{holomorphic}@xmath75\\{antiholomorphic } integrals in eq.([eq : i2 ] ) . indeed , in these new coordinates",
    ", it is possible to factorize and perform the integration over @xmath76 .",
    "this integral makes sense provided that @xmath77 is an integer .",
    "the result reads : @xmath78 with the parameter values @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and the convention @xmath82 .",
    "next , the integral over @xmath83 can be performed .",
    "it is of the form : @xmath84 where we did not write extensively the antiholomorphic part , but it can be obtained by taking the complex conjugate of @xmath76 and the `` tilde '' of the exponents .",
    "the conformal mapping @xmath85 leads , up to an overall factor @xmath86 , to a well - known holomorphic integral , we obtain the same result , see eq.([eq : n0 ] ) and appendix * d * for the comparison . ] . here again , to make sense , all the differences @xmath87 , @xmath88 are integer @xcite : @xmath89 where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 in our case , the parameter values are @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",

    "a comment on the possible values for @xmath10 is in order .",
    "thanks to the relation @xmath97 , the conformal mapping @xmath98 applied to eq.([eq : conforme ] ) leads to the same solution again but for a factor @xmath99 and the interchange @xmath100 .",
    "as we integrate over @xmath101 and as all the other factors depending on @xmath101 are symmetric under the exchange @xmath102 , we see that the final expression will have a factor @xmath103 , and thus only the even @xmath10 contribute .",
    "this is expected since the bfkl pomeron has only even conformal spin - components @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our method applies for any @xmath10 and the final result will be a further check of the validity of the whole calculation .",

    "we can treat all the cases by computing the following generic integral : @xmath106 where @xmath107 for the first integral and @xmath108 for the second one . for simplicity",
    ", we consider that when one of the arguments of @xmath109 has a `` tilde '' it means that we exchange in the formula the corresponding argument with its `` tilde '' counterpart",
    ". this notation can be slightly misleading since the `` tilde''-operation is not involutive .",
    "the index @xmath110 has been introduced in order to take into account the functions @xmath49 which we rewrite @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively . thus the `` physical '' integrals to compute are : @xmath113 with these notations , the amplitudes can be written : @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",

    "the integral defining @xmath109 can then be computed by constructing two series whose coefficients are the residues at the right poles of the two inverse - sines .",
    "each of the series is a @xmath117-function of the type of those computed in appendix * a*. the values for the non - vanishing coefficients @xmath126 we have chosen are : @xmath128 for the helicity - conserving @xmath129 amplitude and @xmath130 for the helicity - flip @xmath131 one .",

    "the differences of @xmath117 in the r.h.s . can be computed using the tricks exposed in appendix  * a * and * b*. the ones needed for our purpose are explicitly shown in appendix  * c*.    however , formula ( [ eq : res ] ) enables us to perform the calculation for general @xmath10 ( and then take the appropriate limits ) .",
    "it enables us to write the @xmath109s as a sum of rational fractions in @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath134 , times a non - rational coefficient which is either @xmath139 or @xmath140 .",
    "the rational fractions are tedious but straightforward to compute using mathematica .",
    "inserting eq.([eq : diffg ] ) after appropriate computation into eq.([eq : intermediaire ] ) , and recalling that @xmath141 yield for @xmath2 : @xmath142 those corresponding to @xmath143 read : @xmath144 as expected , we find that all the other components are zero .",
    "let us summarize our final results .",
    "we obtain the selection rule that for a virtual photon scattering , only the components @xmath2 and @xmath3 contribute .",
    "we list underneath the expressions for these non - vanishing amplitudes .",
    "we introduce the angle @xmath37 between the plane formed by the initial- and final - state electrons and the initial- and final - state photons respectively , which is the argument of @xmath145 .",

    "the other helicity amplitudes are simply obtained using the relations @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "we have computed the coupling of a @xmath0 impact - factor to the llx bfkl pomeron . we have found that our calculation is consistent with a previous one @xcite for the @xmath2 component .",
    "for the higher - conformal spin components , only the two values @xmath3 contribute , as expected from symmetry considerations .    the physical motivation underneath was the precise study of diffractive photon production in the high - energy regime , including the `` higher - twist '' type components induced by conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "with the results we obtained in this paper , we are almost ready to study the phenomenology of the higher - spin components of the bfkl pomeron with a realistic impact - factor .",
