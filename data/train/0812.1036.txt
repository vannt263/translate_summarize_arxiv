    "dehn functions of groups have been the subject of intense activity over the past two decades .",
    "the dehn function @xmath4 of a group @xmath5 is a quasi - isometry invariant which describes the best possible isoperimetric inequality that holds in any geometric model for the group .",
    "specifically , for a given @xmath6 , @xmath4 is the smallest number @xmath7 such that every null - homotopic loop of length at most @xmath6 bounds a disk of area @xmath7 or less .",
    "one defines length and area combinatorially , based on a presentation @xmath8-complex for @xmath5 , and the resulting dehn function is well defined up to coarse lipschitz equivalence .",
    "if @xmath5 is the fundamental group of a closed riemannian manifold @xmath9 , then ordinary length and area in @xmath9 may be used instead , and one obtains an equivalent function .",
    "( this seemingly modest but non - trivial result is sometimes called the filling theorem ; see @xcite or @xcite for a proof . )",
    "due in large part to the work of birget , rips , and sapir @xcite we now have a fairly complete understanding of which functions are dehn functions of finitely presented groups . in the case of power functions , one defines the _ isoperimetric spectrum _ to be the following ( countable ) subset of the line : @xmath10 combining results of @xcite , we know that the isoperimetric spectrum has closure @xmath11 and that it contains all rational numbers in @xmath12",
    ". moreover , in the range @xmath13 , it contains ( almost exactly ) those numbers having computational complexity below a certain threshold @xcite .",
    "the gap @xmath3 reflects gromov s theorem to the effect that every finitely presented group with sub - quadratic dehn function is hyperbolic , and hence has linear dehn function .",
    "several proofs of this result are known : see @xcite . by analogy with ordinary dehn functions , one defines the @xmath0-dimensional dehn function @xmath14 , describing the optimal @xmath0-dimensional isoperimetric inequality that holds in @xmath5 .",
    "given @xmath6 , @xmath14 is the smallest @xmath15 such that every @xmath0-dimensional sphere of volume at most @xmath6 bounds a @xmath16-dimensional ball of volume @xmath15 or less .",
    "one uses combinatorial notions of volume , based on a chosen @xmath0-connected model for @xmath5 .",
    "again , up to coarse lipschitz equivalence , @xmath14 is preserved by quasi - isometries @xcite , and in particular does not depend on the choice of model for @xmath5 .",
    "precise details regarding the definition of @xmath14 are given in section [ prelimsection ] .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth emphasizing here that we are filling spheres with balls , which is quite different from filling spheres with chains , or cycles with chains ( the latter of which leads to the _ homological dehn function _ ) .",
    "it turns out that we do indeed need to make use of other variants ( namely , the _ strong dehn function _  see section [ prelimsection ] ) , but for us the primary object of most immediate geometric interest is the dehn function as described above . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the following question : what is the possible isoperimetric behavior of groups , in various dimensions ? for each positive integer @xmath0",
    "one defines the _",
    "@xmath0-dimensional isoperimetric spectrum _ : @xmath17 until recently , relatively little was known about @xmath18 , especially when @xmath19 .",
    "a few results concerning @xmath20 were known : in @xcite it was shown that @xmath20 contains infinitely many points in the interval @xmath21 , and various lower and upper bounds were located throughout @xmath22 ; also in @xcite it was shown that @xmath23 is dense in @xmath21 and that @xmath24 .",
    "the recent paper @xcite established that @xmath18 is dense in @xmath25 and contains all rational numbers in this range .",
    "the endpoint @xmath26 corresponds to the isoperimetric inequality represented by spheres in euclidean space .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to address the sub - euclidean range @xmath27 and establish the existence of isoperimetric exponents throughout this interval , for @xmath28 .    to state our results",
    "we need some notation .",
    "if @xmath7 is a non - singular @xmath29 integer matrix , let @xmath30 denote the ascending hnn extension of @xmath31 with monodromy @xmath7 .",
    "our first result is the following .",
    "[ mainthm1 ] let @xmath7 be a @xmath32 integer matrix with eigenvalues @xmath33 such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "we show that the exponents arising in the theorem are dense in the interval @xmath3 .",
    "thus , roughly half of these groups have sub - euclidean filling volume for @xmath8-spheres , occupying densely the desired range of possible behavior .",
    "given an @xmath29 matrix @xmath7 , the _ suspension _",
    "@xmath37 of @xmath7 is the @xmath38 matrix obtained by direct sum with the @xmath39 identity matrix . since @xmath40",

    "this approach is rather less promising in the sub - euclidean realm , since there are no one - dimensional dehn functions there to reduce to .",
    "( reducing to larger dehn functions does not seem feasible , at least by similar methods . )    instead we must find and measure least - volume fillings of @xmath8-spheres in @xmath30 directly , using properties of the particular geometry of this group .",
    "we work with a piecewise riemannian cell complex with a metric locally modeled on a solvable lie group @xmath49 .",
    "this metric is particularly simple from the point of view of the given coordinates , and these preferred coordinates make possible various volume and area calculations that are central to our arguments .",
    "the preferred coordinates just mentioned do not behave well combinatorially , however .",
    "coordinate lines pass through cells in an aperiodic manner , and this can not be remedied by simply changing the cell structure . if one attempts to measure volume combinatorially , counting cells by passing between cells and their neighbors in an organized fashion ( as with `` @xmath50-corridor '' arguments , for example ) , one loses the advantage of the preferred coordinates conferred by the special geometry of these groups . to count cells , therefore , we use integration and divide by the volume of a cell .",
    "the combinatorial structure is still relevant , however .",
    "the piecewise riemannian model is not a manifold , and its branching behavior is a prominent feature of the geometry of @xmath30 . in order to make clean transitions between the combinatorial and riemannian viewpoints",
    ", we use the transversality technology of buoncristiano , rourke , and sanderson @xcite .",
    "this provides the appropriate notion of van kampen diagrams for higher - dimensional spheres and fillings .",
    "transversality also helps in dealing with singular maps , which otherwise present technical difficulties .",
    "one other technical matter deserves mention : in order to apply results of @xcite to deduce theorem [ mainthm2 ] , we are obliged to find bounds for the _ strong dehn function _ , which encodes uniform isoperimetric inequalities for fillings of surfaces by arbitrary @xmath51-manifolds .",
    "see section [ prelimsection ] for definitions and results concerning the strong dehn function .",

    "in this section we discuss in detail some of the key notions needed to carry out the proofs of the theorems .",
    "first we give a brief account of the transversality theory of buoncristiano , rourke , and sanderson .",
    "then we discuss volume , dehn functions of various types , and some basic results concerning these .      using transversality , a map from a manifold to a cell complex",
    "can be put into a nice form , called a transverse map @xcite .",
    "transverse maps induce _ generalized handle decomopositions _ of manifolds , which will play the role of van kampen diagrams in higher dimensions .",
    "whereas _ admissible maps _ were used for this purpose in @xcite , transverse maps have additional structure , incorporating combinatorial information dependent on the way cells meet locally in the target complex .",
    "index @xmath60 handle _ ( or _ generalized handle _ ) of dimension @xmath61 is a product @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a compact , connected @xmath60-dimensional manifold with boundary , and @xmath64 is a closed disk . let @xmath9 be a closed @xmath61-manifold .",
    "a _ generalized handle decomposition _ of @xmath9 is a filtration @xmath65 by codimension - zero submanifolds , such that for each @xmath60 , @xmath66 is obtained from @xmath67 by attaching finitely many index @xmath60 handles , as follows . to attach a single handle @xmath68 ,",
    "choose an embedding @xmath69 and form the manifold @xmath70 .",
    "note that handle attachment is always along @xmath71 , and never along @xmath72 . to attach several handles , we require that the attaching maps have disjoint images in @xmath73 , so that the order of attachment does not matter . note",
    "that both @xmath67 and the individual handles @xmath74 are embedded in @xmath66 .",
    "if every @xmath63 is a disk then this is the usual notion of handle decomposition arising in classical morse theory .",
    "some new things can occur by varying @xmath63 , however .",
    "for instance , we allow @xmath63 to be closed , in which case the attaching map is empty and @xmath70 is the disjoint union @xmath75 .",
    "such a handle is called a _",
    "floating handle_. for example , @xmath76 is formed from @xmath77 by attaching ( floating ) @xmath78-handles @xmath79 , and @xmath76 is simply several copies of @xmath80 .",
    "( the lowest - index handles will always be floating ones . )",
    "another phenomenon is that handles may be embedded in @xmath9 in topologically interesting ways , as in the following example .    given a closed orientable @xmath51-manifold @xmath9 , we may construct a generalized handle decomposition as follows .",
    "let @xmath81 be a knot or link in @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath82 be a regular neighborhood of @xmath83 and declare each component to be a ( floating ) @xmath84-handle .",
    "let @xmath85 be a seifert surface for @xmath83 , and let @xmath86 be the components of @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath8-handles will be regular neighborhoods of the surfaces @xmath88 in @xmath89 .",
    "lastly , the @xmath51-handles will be the components of @xmath90 .",
    "this decomposition has no @xmath78-handles , and its @xmath84-handles are ( obviously ) knotted .",
    "now suppose @xmath9 is an @xmath61-manifold with boundary . a _",
    "generalized handle decomposition of @xmath9 _ is a pair of filtrations @xmath91 and @xmath92 by codimension - zero submanifolds , such that :    * the filtration @xmath93 is a generalized handle decomposition of @xmath94 , * for each @xmath60 , @xmath66 is obtained from @xmath95 by attaching finitely many index @xmath60 handles , and * each index @xmath96 handle of @xmath94 is a connected component of the intersection of @xmath94 with an index @xmath60 handle of @xmath9 . in particular , @xmath97 for all @xmath60 .    in ( ii ) , each handle @xmath98 is attached via an embedding @xmath99 .",
    "as before , we require the images of the attaching maps of the index @xmath60 handles to be disjoint .",
    "it follows that the individual @xmath60-handles are embedded in @xmath9 , and are disjoint from each other .",
    "let @xmath100 be a map from a compact @xmath61-manifold to a cw complex .",
    "we say that @xmath101 is _ transverse _ to the cell structure of @xmath102 if @xmath9 has a generalized handle decomposition such that the restriction of @xmath101 to each handle is given by projection onto the second factor , followed by the characteristic map of a cell of @xmath102 .",
    "thus , index @xmath60 handles map to @xmath103-dimensional cells . in particular , @xmath9 maps into the @xmath61-skeleton of @xmath102 . in a transverse map there may be floating handles of any index , and it may not be possible to modify @xmath101 to eliminate these . by the same token , one must always allow for the possibility of knotted handles .",
    "one virtue of transverse maps is that they can easily be proved to exist .",
    "however , to accomplish this , we must assume additional structure on the target complex @xmath102 .",
    "we say that @xmath102 is a _ transverse cw complex _ if the attaching map of every cell is transverse to the cell structure of the skeleton to which it is attached .",
    "the main existence result is the following :    let @xmath9 be a compact smooth manifold and @xmath104 a continuous map into a transverse cw complex .",
    "suppose @xmath105 is transverse .",
    "then @xmath101 is homotopic rel @xmath94 to a transverse map @xmath106 .",
    "the theorem includes the case where @xmath9 is closed : all maps of closed manifolds can be made transverse by a homotopy .",
    "this theorem is proved in @xcite for pl manifolds , and the proof in the smooth case is entirely analogous .",
    "the proof is a step by step application of smooth transversality , applied to preimages of open cells ( considered as smooth manifolds themselves ) , starting with the top dimensional cells and working down .",
    "the first stage of the argument , in which the @xmath78-handles are constructed , is explained fully in the proof of lemma  2.3 of @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the construction of admissible maps ( defined below ) .    in order to apply the theorem one needs transverse cw complexes .",
    "any cw complex can be made transverse by successively homotoping the attaching maps of its cells ( by the transversality theorem and induction on dimension ) ; this procedure preserves homotopy type .",
    "moreover , in this paper , the complex @xmath102 that we use can be made transverse in a more direct and controlled way , preserving both its homeomorphism type and its partition into open cells ; see section  [ 3cx ] and figure  [ fig : cell ] .",
    "recall from @xcite the definition of an _ admissible map _ : it is a map @xmath107 such that the preimage of every open @xmath61-cell is a disjoint union of open @xmath61-dimensional balls in @xmath9 , each mapped by @xmath101 homeomorphically onto the @xmath61-cell .",
    "the _ combinatorial volume _ of an admissible map , denoted @xmath108 , is the number of open balls mapping to @xmath61-cells .",
    "it is clear that transverse maps are admissible : the interiors of @xmath78-handles are open balls , and the rest of @xmath9 maps into @xmath109 .",
    "conversely , if one applies the proof of the transversality theorem to an admissible map to make it transverse , then the preimages of the @xmath61-cells will not change ( except possibly by being shrunk slightly ) , and combinatorial volume is preserved .",
    "for this reason , given an admissible map , the closures of the open balls mapping to @xmath61-cells will be called @xmath78-handles .    note",
    "that in an admissible map , @xmath78-handles may intersect each other in their boundaries .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 has a cell structure , then the identity map is admissible , with @xmath78-handles equal to the closures of the top - dimensional cells .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.3 ) it is shown that every map from a smooth or pl manifold is homotopic to an admissible map .",
    "this is a special case of the transversality theorem , though it is not required that the target cw complex be transverse .",
    "the existence of admissible maps can also be proved without relying on a smooth or pl structure ; see epstein ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.3 ) .",
    "in this paper , generalized handle decompositions ( and transverse maps ) will serve as higher - dimensional analogues of van kampen diagrams .",
    "indeed , in dimension @xmath8 , transverse maps already provide an alternative to the combinatorial approach to diagrams , and they have several advantages .",
    "this is the viewpoint taken in @xcite and @xcite , for example . with van kampen diagrams one often considers _ reduced _ diagrams , where no folded cell pairs occur .",
    "the same type of cancellation process also works for admissible and transverse maps .",
    "one such process is given as follows .",
    "let @xmath110 be an admissible map , and let @xmath111 be @xmath78-handles , and @xmath112 a @xmath84-dimensional submanifold homeomorphic to an interval , with endpoints in @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( we also allow the degenerate case in which @xmath46 is a point in @xmath115 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath101 maps @xmath46 to a point and maps @xmath113 and @xmath114 to the same @xmath61-cell , with opposite orientations ( relative to a neighborhood of @xmath116 , which is always orientable ) . since @xmath113 and @xmath114 are @xmath78-handles , there are homeomorphisms @xmath117 such that @xmath118 for some characteristic map @xmath119 .",
    "now delete interiors of @xmath120 from @xmath9 and then form a quotient @xmath121 by gluing boundaries via @xmath122 and collapsing @xmath46 to a point .",
    "the new space maps to @xmath102 by @xmath101 , and there is a homeomorphism @xmath123 .",
    "now @xmath124 is an admissible map @xmath125 with two fewer @xmath78-handles .",
    "note that the other @xmath78-handles are unchanged .",
    "if desired , this new map can then be made transverse , with the same @xmath78-handles , and with its ( lowered ) volume unchanged .",
    "there is , in fact , a more general procedure for cancelling @xmath113 and @xmath114 that does not require @xmath46 to map to a point .",
    "this procedure is due to hopf @xcite and a detailed treatment was given by epstein @xcite . if @xmath102 is @xmath8-dimensional then the more general procedure is not particularly useful : new @xmath78-handle pairs can be created when cancelling @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and volume may fail to decrease . in higher dimensions ,",
    "however , no new @xmath78-handle pairs are created and the volume will always decrease by @xmath8 .      if @xmath126 is a smooth manifold , @xmath9 an oriented riemannian manifold of the same dimension , and @xmath127 a smooth map , then the _ volume _ of @xmath101 can be defined .",
    "following gromov ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remarks 2.7 and 2.8@xmath128 ) , let @xmath129 be the volume form on @xmath9 and choose any riemannian metric on @xmath126 .",

    "note that we are using @xmath131 , not @xmath132 , in the notation of @xcite .",
    "( the latter allows cancellation of volume , which is not appropriate in our setting . ) in fact , we need not assume that @xmath9 is oriented , since @xmath133 is still defined . if @xmath134 then @xmath135 is also denoted @xmath136 .",
    "if @xmath101 is an immersion then this definition amounts to giving @xmath126 the pullback metric and taking the volume of @xmath126 .",
    "more generally , if @xmath101 fails to be an immersion at some @xmath137 , then @xmath138 is zero at @xmath6 , and does not contribute to volume .",
