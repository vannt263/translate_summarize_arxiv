    "<S> _ introduction . _ </S>",
    "<S> discrete time quantum walk is a process in which the evolution of a quantum particle on a lattice depends on a state of an auxiliary system ( coin ) . in the simplest version of a one - dimensional quantum </S>",
    "<S> walk the coin is a two - level system . </S>",
    "<S> the particle moves either one step to the left or to the right depending on the state of the coin . between subsequent steps </S>",
    "<S> the state of the coin evolves , which after many steps of the walk results in nontrivial correlations between the coin and the particle s position and in a spatial probability distribution that in general can not be reproduced by classical random walks @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a single step of an initially localized quantum walk can be considered as a projective von neumann measurement of the coin , because if one finds the particle at position @xmath2 one knows that the state of the coin corresponds to the `` right / left shift '' . however , in general one can allow the system to evolve for more than one step before the position measurement is done . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the particle can be found in more than two different positions and one may ask whether the measurement of particle at position @xmath0 corresponds to some generalized measurement of the qubit , i.e. , a positive operator value measure ( povm ) on the coin state . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we investigate such a possibility .    </S>",
    "<S> povms allow one to gain more information from a single measurement than the standard von neumann projective measurements . </S>",
    "<S> their wide applicability include discrimination of quantum states @xcite and quantum state tomography in terms of symmetric informationally complete ( sic ) povms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> physically , povms correspond to projective measurements on a joint system of the system of interest and an ancilla whose state is known . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , povm elements @xmath1 are given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the identity operator on the hilbert space of the system , @xmath5 the state of an ancilla , @xmath6 is the von neumann projector on the joint hilbert space and one traces out an ancillary system . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of measuring the @xmath7th povm element on a state @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the non - negativity condition @xmath10 the complete set of measurement operators has to have the resolution of identity , therefore povm elements obey @xmath11 . in case of quantum </S>",
    "<S> walks the role of ancilla is played by the position of the particle and the form of the effective projector @xmath6 stems from the nontrivial evolution of the walk .    for a one - dimensional discrete time quantum walk the state of the system </S>",
    "<S> is described by two degrees of freedom @xmath12 , the position of the particle @xmath13 and the coin @xmath14 . since the dynamics of the system is discrete , one step is given by the unitary operator @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the conditional translation operator and @xmath17 is a coin operator whose action in general can depend on position and time @xmath18 throughout the paper we use the notation @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> the one step is analogical to an action of stern - gerlach device ( s - g ) on spin @xmath21 particles . </S>",
    "<S> the action of the coin operator corresponds to spin rotation which is analogical to the choice of a specific direction of s - g or an application of a linear magnetic field , whereas the splitting of the particle beam is obtained via an application of @xmath22 , which corresponds to a magnetic field gradient . in principle , before the actual measurement happens ( particles hit the screen ) one can perform another spin rotation ( coin operation ) and beam splitting ( @xmath22 operation ) . </S>",
    "<S> interesting effects may happen if one allows different particle beams to interfere before they hit the screen .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum walks are computationally more efficient than their classical counterparts and were shown to be able to efficiently solve a number of problems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it was shown that they are capable of universal quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , quantum walks were implemented in laboratory and it was shown that one can achieve a substantial control over the evolution of a quantum walker @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of great importance to investigate and to exploit all the possibilities that quantum walks can offer .    </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a simple example of a quantum walk that is capable of optimal unambiguous state discrimination of two equally probable qubit quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of this example allows us to construct a general algorithm for a generation of arbitrary povm elements . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss how to modify a standard s - g apparatus , which in many textbooks is considered as a flagship example of von neumann measurement , to allow it to perform generalized measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the modification is based on our quantum walk model . in particular , we consider implementation of the state discrimination protocol . </S>",
    "<S> derivation of povm elements for the state discrimination protocol and an explicit quantum walk algorithm for generation of sic povm are given in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> _ example : unambiguous state discrimination . </S>",
    "<S> imagine that one is given one of two qubit states @xmath23 with equal a priori probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to find which of the two states was given . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three possible answers to this test : _ it is definitely state 1 _ , _ it is definitely state 2 _ , or _ </S>",
    "<S> i do not know_.    now , let us introduce a quantum walk capable of achieving this goal . </S>",
    "<S> first , we note that it is always possible to represent the two states as @xmath24 where @xmath25 $ ] . for the first step we choose the coin operator to be trivial @xmath26 , hence the state </S>",
    "<S> after one qw step is @xmath27 for the next step the coin operators are @xmath28 @xmath29 and identity elsewhere , therefore the state after coin operation is @xmath30 and after translation @xmath31 finally , for the third step the coin operator is identity everywhere except for position @xmath32 for which it is the hadamard operator @xmath33 therefore @xmath34 as a consequence , if one measures particle at position @xmath35 , one immediately knows that the coin was in @xmath36 state , if at position @xmath37 it was @xmath38 state , and if at position @xmath39 one learns nothing . in the appendix </S>",
    "<S> a we show that the above quantum walk indeed generates the povm elements corresponding to the unambiguous state discrimination problem .    </S>",
    "<S> _ generation of arbitrary rank 1 povm elements . </S>",
    "<S> _ we focus on rank 1 povms , since higher rank povms can be constructed as a convex combination of rank 1 elements . </S>",
    "<S> we will come back to this problem at the end of the next section . in case of a single qubit the orthogonality relation between states and rank 1 povm elements </S>",
    "<S> uniquely determines the latter up to the magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this property is going to be our main tool in the construction of a quantum walk algorithm for povm elements .    to clarify what we mean , let us start with the following observation . </S>",
    "<S> imagine that the initial state of the quantum walk is localized at position @xmath32 and that the initial coin state is either one of the two orthogonal states @xmath40 or @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> next , assume that at some stage of the quantum walk there is nonzero probability of finding the particle at position @xmath42 for both initial states . if we apply a unitary coin operation at position @xmath42 such that after the subsequent translation there is nonzero probability of finding the particle at position @xmath43 for the initial state @xmath40 , but the probability of finding the particle at position @xmath43 is zero for the initial state @xmath41 , then the measurement corresponding to position @xmath42 has to correspond to rank 1 povm element of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 . here </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the probability that particle is at position @xmath43 could only be due to translation from @xmath42 , not @xmath46 ( due to a reason that will become clear in a moment ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , note that it is always possible to find a proper coin operator . </S>",
    "<S> the coin states at position @xmath42 corresponding to initial coin states @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be denoted as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these two states do not have to be orthogonal . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that there always exists a unitary operation that transforms @xmath48 into @xmath49 , therefore if we apply this operation as a coin transformation at position @xmath42 , the subsequent translation will be always to position @xmath50 , not @xmath43 , given the initial coin state was @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now propose an algorithm for the generation of an arbitrary rank 1 povm @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> initiate the quantum walk at position @xmath32 with the coin state corresponding to the qubit state one wants to measure 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> set @xmath53 3 .   while @xmath54 do : 1 .   </S>",
    "<S> apply coin operation @xmath55 at position @xmath32 and identity elsewhere and then apply translation operator @xmath22 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> apply coin operation @xmath56 at position @xmath35 , @xmath57 at position @xmath37 and identity elsewhere and then apply translation operator @xmath22 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58    the povm that is going to be generated depends solely on the coin operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 which are of the form @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the above @xmath61 is the state that at this stage of the algorithm would correspond to the coin state at position @xmath32 if the initial coin state was @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 is a state orthogonal to @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this guarantees that after the step 3(a ) the povm element at position @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath66 is chosen such that after the step 3(b ) the element at position @xmath67 has proper magnitude @xmath68 .    before we prove the algorithm s capability of generating an arbitrary rank 1 povm , let us note that it generates spatial probability distribution over positions @xmath69 , @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the povm element @xmath1 corresponds to the measurement of particle at position @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> note , that the previously considered algorithm for unambiguous state discrimination is in fact a special case of the above one ( without the last step 3b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interference phenomenon occurs only at position @xmath32 and once the particle passes the position @xmath35 it can only move to the right ( which clarifies our previous assumption that there is no translation from @xmath46 to @xmath43 ) . on the other hand , due to the @xmath57 operation at position @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> the particle can never pass beyond this point .    </S>",
    "<S> _ proof of universality . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have already shown that a proper choice of @xmath55 allows one to generate an element proportional to @xmath72 for any @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> what is left to show is that the algorithm gives one a possibility to manipulate with the magnitude @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the inductive approach . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , note that for the first repetition of the subroutine 3(a)-(c ) ( @xmath74 ) the state of the particle is initially localized at @xmath32 and the step 3(a ) corresponds to a standard von neumann measurement . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , measurement of particle at position @xmath35 and @xmath37 corresponds to qubit projections onto @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively . the subsequent step 3(b ) results in two povm elements . </S>",
    "<S> the first one @xmath77 corresponding to @xmath67 and the second one @xmath78 corresponding to @xmath32 . note that @xmath79 can be chosen such that @xmath80 , therefore the element at position @xmath67 corresponds to @xmath81 and the one at @xmath32 to @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , let us assume that the quantum walk has already generated elements @xmath83 corresponding to positions @xmath84 respectively ( @xmath85 since the generation of @xmath86 implies also the generation of @xmath87 due to the fact that povm elements have the resolution of identity ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of identity implies that the measurement at position @xmath32 corresponds to @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> we apply @xmath89 such that after the step 3(a ) the element @xmath90 splits into @xmath91 at position @xmath35 and @xmath92 at position @xmath37 . after the step 3(b ) </S>",
    "<S> the element at position @xmath67 is @xmath93 , which corresponds to @xmath94 if @xmath95 . in general the range of @xmath96 </S>",
    "<S> can be @xmath97 , where @xmath98 arises from the non - negativity constraint @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> below we show that @xmath100 , therefore it is always possible to choose an appropriate angle @xmath101 such that @xmath94 is generated at position @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> since povm elements act in a two - dimensional space the element @xmath102 is a unique rank 1 operator because at least one of its eigenvalues is zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the goal is to show that after the step 3(a ) the element corresponding to position @xmath37 , given by @xmath103 , is also a rank 1 operator . </S>",
    "<S> this is trivial , since the measurement of the quantum walker at position @xmath37 gives us full information about the coin state , namely that it is @xmath49 , which can only happen if the measurement operator is rank 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us discuss the generation of rank 2 povm elements . </S>",
    "<S> these elements can be constructed as a convex combination of two rank 1 elements . </S>",
    "<S> the above algorithm can be modified in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> imagine that the algorithm generated @xmath104 povm elements corresponding to the measurement of the quantum walker at positions @xmath105 and that we want to construct a rank 2 element that is a combination of two rank 1 elements corresponding to positions @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is enough to apply @xmath57 coin operation at position @xmath107 and then to apply conditional translation @xmath109 times . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the two probability amplitudes originating from positions @xmath106 and @xmath107 meet at position @xmath110 and the respective position measurement corresponds to the povm element @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> the other rank 1 povm elements are also shifted to the right by @xmath109 positions , however their structure remains unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> _ generalization of s - g apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> _ the main physical mechanism that allows quantum walks to implement povm is the interference between the probability amplitudes of the quantum walker . </S>",
    "<S> this interference is not present in the standard von neumann model of measurement ( see for example @xcite ) , whose flagship example is the s - g apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> however , in principle one may modify this apparatus to incorporate interference between particle beams .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a beam of spin-1/2 particles incident upon s - g apparatus . due to the gradient of magnetic field the beam splits into two beams . </S>",
    "<S> the upper beam contains particles whose spin is oriented `` up '' along the respective direction , and the lower beam contains particles whose spin is oriented `` down '' . </S>",
    "<S> if we placed a screen behind the s - g magnet we would perform a standard projective measurement in the `` up''/``down '' basis . </S>",
    "<S> however , we may continue the experiment by allowing two beams to pass through different homogeneous linear magnetic fields that would cause different rotations of spins . </S>",
    "<S> these beams fan out , but if we use additional s - g magnets we may split them again and some of new beams would overlap . </S>",
    "<S> if this overlap happens in another s - g magnet one may cause the beams to interfere ( just like in an optical beam splitter ) .     </S>",
    "<S> schematic picture representing generalization of s - g apparatus that incorporates povm . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the above setting visualizes the unambiguous state discrimination scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the heart of the setting is the last s - g magnet whose magnetic field gradient allows for an interference effect between two spin-1/2 particle beams . </S>",
    "<S> block magnets in between s - g magnets represent action of different homogeneous linear magnetic fields on the beams and correspond to coin operations . </S>",
    "<S> s - g magnets correspond to conditional translations . ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] we sketch a s - g implementation of the unambiguous state discrimination protocol based on the quantum walk that we introduced in the beginning of this work . </S>",
    "<S> the particle beam is split into two parts that pass through different homogeneous linear magnetic fields . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the spin orientation of the upper beam is changed from `` up '' to `` down '' by the @xmath112 rotation about an axis perpendicular to the beam . due to this fact </S>",
    "<S> , the subsequent s - g magnet does not split this beam , but rather changes the direction of its propagation . as a result , after the last s - g magnet there are only three beams corresponding to the outcomes : _ it is definitely state @xmath113 _ , _ it is definitely state @xmath114 _ , and _ </S>",
    "<S> i do not know_.    _ conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> _ we proved that discrete - time quantum walks are capable of performing generalized measurements on a single qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the main physical effect employed in this process is the interference between the probability amplitudes of the quantum walker . in particular , we proposed a quantum walk algorithm for the generation of arbitrary rank 1 and rank 2 povm elements for a single qubit . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we explicitly constructed quantum walks for unambiguous state discrimination of two equally probable qubit states and sic - povm ( see appendix b ) . finally , using quantum walk approach we considered a generalization of s - g apparatus .    </S>",
