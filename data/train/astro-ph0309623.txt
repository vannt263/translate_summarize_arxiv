    "the most commonly accepted paradigm for the formation of structure in the universe , ranging from galaxies to clusters and superclusters of galaxies , predicts that they are assembled via the hierarchical clustering of dark matter ( dm ) halos , in the framework of the so called @xmath5cdm cosmology .",
    "although these models have been very successful in describing large scale structure and much recent progress has been made in understanding the processes behind the assembly of individual galaxies through numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , semi - analytic modelling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "+ the study of the stellar halos of disk galaxies , such as our own milky way ( mw ) , can give a substantial contribution in this field .",
    "from many studies ( for a review see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , it is known that the mw halo is populated by old , metal - poor stars , whose origin is debated .",
    "they may have formed in the early stages of the dissipational collapse of the gas in the proto - galactic dm halo .",
    "alternatively they may have been accreted through the stripping of stars from satellite galaxies .",
    "evidence that this process plays an important role in building up the stellar population of the halo , has come from the sagittarius dsph @xcite , a low - latitude halo stream found in the sloan digital sky survey ( hereafter sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ongoing disruption process of the palomar 5 globular cluster @xcite , and the detection of streams in local high velocity stars @xcite .",
    "how much of the halo light and mass must be ascribed to this kind of interactions and how common they were in the past is still unclear .",
    "+ in order to answer these questions in a more general context , the extension of the observations to a statistical sample of external galaxies is required .",
    "unfortunately the surface brightness contributed by a stellar halo similar to the one in the mw is typically 7 to 10 magnitudes fainter than the central parts of the other galactic components ( disk , bulge ) and than the sky . at present day ,",
    "observations of the halo are available only for a handful nearby galaxies and provide varying results .",
    "recent work by @xcite has demonstrated the presence of substructure in the moderately metal - enriched stellar halo of m31 , that is likely to be the relic of the disruption of one or more small companion galaxy .",
    "the search for halos in more distant galaxies , for which stars belonging to different components can not be resolved , has been focused on edge - on disks , because of the much lower contamination of the halo by the projected disk stars .",
    "problems with flat fielding , scattered light from other background and foreground sources , and extended psf wings make it extremely difficult to obtain reliable photometry down to 29 - 30 @xmath6 , as required in order to characterise galactic halos . after the first detection of halo around ngc 5907 claimed by @xcite , many controversial results have followed .",

    "the presence of large - scale fluctuations is already obvious from a superficial inspection of the contour plots in fig .",
    "[ contourfig ] .",
    "we restrict the analysis of the noise to the annulus ( 130 pixel inner radius and 96 pixel thickness ) on which the sky level has been computed , and we consider the rms of the intensity after re - binning the image by different linear factors , ranging from 1 to 50 .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath60 on the scale - length @xmath61 is well described by a power law of the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the noise on one - pixel scale , and @xmath64 , thus indicating that the noise has significant large scale structure in excess to what is expected in the case of pure gaussian noise ( for which @xmath65 ) .      the most obvious way to investigate the properties of the approximately round , low surface brightness structures emerging in fig .",
    "[ contourfig ] is to extract surface brightness ( sb ) profiles , averaging the flux in large wedges at different position angles .",
    "first of all , we divide the image in four circular sectors of @xmath66 aperture , centred at @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 position angles ( pas ) .",
    "each of these sectors is in turn radially divided into a number of coronae , geometrically spaced such that the outer radius of the @xmath71th corona is given by @xmath72 , with @xmath73 .",
    "finally , we estimate the mean sb as a function of the radius for @xmath67 ( i.e. along the disk ) and @xmath68 pa ( i.e. perpendicular to the disk ) averaging the sb in pairs of corresponding coronae in the two symmetric sectors at @xmath67 and @xmath69 and at @xmath68 and @xmath70 pa , respectively . in each of the four graphs of fig .",

    "thus the @xmath74 detection limits for the sb profiles can be assessed as @xmath75 for the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 band and as @xmath76 for the @xmath11 band .",
    "+ in order to evaluate the errors on the sb we must consider contributions from 1 ) the background fluctuations and 2 ) the intrinsic scatter in the average signal from a galaxy .",
    "the first one is just provided by the background rms as evaluated in the previous section using eq . [ bkgnoise ] , with @xmath61 given by the square root of the area of the corona over which the signal is integrated .",
    "the estimation of the intrinsic scatter contribution is much more cumbersome , since the shape of the statistical distribution of the pixel counts in the coronae is not known _ a priori _ and the light distribution of the galaxy itself is likely to give a major contribution to the rms of the count statistics . in order to remove it , for each pixel",
    "we consider the deviation from the average intensity of the corresponding pixels in the four image quadrants , which are symmetric with respect to the x and y axes , and express the intrinsic rms as : @xmath77 ^ 2}}\\label{rms_int}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the pixel intensity , @xmath79 is the number of pixels per corona per quadrant , and @xmath80 is the average intensity over the @xmath81 index . in the absence of any large scale background fluctuation the error on the average intensity is just obtained dividing the ( [ rms_int ] ) by @xmath82 . adding the contribution of the large scale fluctuations , we can write the error as : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is given by eq.[bkgnoise ] with @xmath61 given by the square root of the area of the corona , and the factor 2 comes in from having averaged two coronae . such an error estimate has been proved to be consistent with the scatter of the average intensity in the corresponding coronae in the four quadrants .",

    "[ sbprof_fig ] we plot the axial ratio @xmath85 of the isophotes as a function of the radius ( semi - major axis ) .",

    "[ sbprof_fig ] , the profile of the wedges centred on the disk show an exponential decrease of the sb with radius , as it is typical for disks .",
    "perpendicular to the disk , instead , the rapid initial decrease of the sb becomes shallower as we go further away from the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the trend is well approximated by a power - law with index @xmath90 , as the straight - line behaviour of the triangles in the log - scale plots points out .",
    "this is in general true for the four bands analysed .",
    "however , the relative intensity at the same radial distance along the disk and perpendicular to it is different in different bands , reflecting a possible dependence of the flattening of the diffuse halo on the band and , in turn , this points to colours gradients in the halo itself . as already noted from the isophotal contours in fig .",

    "+ the robustness and the significance of the estimates given above , will be discussed in detail in sec.[discussion_sec ] .      in order to understand the dependence of the halo features on the galaxy luminosity , we analyse the stacked images ( exponential scale - length rescaling ) for three luminosity bins in the @xmath10 band , namely the ` bright ' ( @xmath143 ) , the ` intermediate ' ( @xmath144 ) and the ` faint ' one @xmath145 ) .",

    "comparisons with the light distribution expected from simple thin+thick disk models , in which we have accounted for the whole range of galaxy inclinations and for the effective psf , demonstrate that no exponential vertical disk component can yield the observed power - law shape of the sb profiles at @xmath151 in any of the four considered bands . adding a moderately flattened ( @xmath2 ) , power - law ( @xmath152 or @xmath1 ) halo component to a simple exponential disk",
    ", it is possible to reproduce the basic features in the observed profiles quite well .",
    "+ it could be argued , that the emission we detect in the outer regions is produced by small bulges .",

    "<S> we present a statistical analysis of halo emission for a sample of 1047 edge - on disk galaxies imaged in five bands by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . stacking the homogeneously rescaled images of the galaxies </S>",
    "<S> , we can measure surface brightnesses as deep as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the results strongly support the almost ubiquitous presence of stellar halos around disk galaxies , whose spatial distribution is well described by a power - law @xmath1 , in a moderately flattened spheroid ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the colour estimates in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , although uncertain , give a clear indication for extremely red stellar populations , hinting at old ages and/or non - negligible metal enrichment . </S>",
    "<S> these results support the idea of halos being assembled via early merging of satellite galaxies .    </S>",
