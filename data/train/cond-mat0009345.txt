    "the subject of adsorption of a long flexible polymer chain immersed in a poor solvent on an impenetrable surface with an attractive short - range attraction has received considerable attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "this is because an attractive surface may lead to adsorption - desorption transition from the state when the chain is mostly attached to the surface to the state of detachment when the temperature is increased .",
    "this behaviour finds applications in lubrication , adhesion , surface protection , etc .",
    "it is known that when a chain interacts with a surface its conformational properties get modified in comparison with its bulk properties @xcite .",
    "this is because of a subtle competition between the gain of internal energy and the corresponding loss of entropy due to the constraint imposed on the chain by the impenetrable surface .",
    "this competition leads to the possibility of co - existence of different regimes and multicritical behaviour .",
    "the essential physics associated with the behaviour of a surface interacting polymer chain in a good solvent is derived from a model of self - avoiding walk ( saw ) on a semi - infinite lattice .",
    "if the surface is attractive , it contributes an energy @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) for each step of the walk on the surface .",
    "this leads to an increased probability characterized by the boltzmann factor @xmath7 of making a step along the surface , since for @xmath8 , @xmath9 for any finite temperature @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "because of this the polymer chain get adsorbed at low temperatures on the surface while at high temperatures all polymer conformations have almost same weight and non adsorbed ( or desorbed ) behaviour prevails .",
    "the transition between these two regimes is marked by a critical adsorption temperature @xmath12 , with a desorbed phase for @xmath13 and adsorbed phase for @xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath15 . at @xmath14",
    "the chain acquires a conformation such that a fraction of monomers get attached to the surface and others form a layer of finite thickness parallel to the surface .",
    "the thickness of the layer diverges at @xmath16 .",
    "one may define the crossover exponent @xmath17 , at @xmath16 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total number of monomers and @xmath20 the number of monomers on the surface .",
    "the transition point @xmath12 is a tricritical point @xcite .",
    "both the surface and the bulk critical exponents have been calculated using renormalization group methods @xcite , transfer matrix methods @xcite , exact enumeration method @xcite and monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "for a two dimensional system exact values of the exponents have been found by using conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "the situation is , however , different when the surface interacting polymer is a in compact globule state . in the vicinity of an impenetrable attracting surface the monomer - monomer attraction which is responsible for the collapsed state of the chain and the surface - monomer attraction responsible for the adsorption will compete .",
    "this competition may give rise new features in the conformational behaviour of the chain .",
    "for instance , a globule can get attached to the surface at some value of monomer - surface attraction without any significant modification in its structure as shown in fig . @xmath21 .",
    "such a phase has been shown to exist in between the bulk collapsed and adsorbed phases in both two and three dimensions for isotropic @xmath22 non - directed ) polymer chain and is called surface attached globule ( sag ) phase @xcite . in an adsorbed phase",
    "the number of monomers on the surface are proportional to @xmath19 and the thickness of the layer formed by the chain parallel to the surface proportional to @xmath23 . on the other hand",
    "the bulk globule has one correlation length ( the radius of gyration ) which scales with @xmath19 as @xmath24 where d is the dimensionality of the space . in the sag phase",
    "we have two correlation lengths , one parallel and another perpendicular to the surface .",
    "they may scale with @xmath19 as @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    in this article",
    "we investigate the surface adsorption and collapsed of a directed polymer chain on a square lattice . since for two dimensional system surface is a line",
    ", it can have only one adsorbed phase which we refer to as adsorbed expanded ( ae ) phase .",
    "the problem of adsorption and collapse of directed polymer has been studied using transfer matrix technique @xcite .",
    "the phase boundary of the collapsed phase separating it from the adsorbed expanded and the bulk expanded has been obtained exactly @xcite as well as numerically @xcite .",
    "these calculations show that there are three phases , viz .",
    "desorbed expanded ( de ) , desorbed collapsed ( dc ) and adsorbed expanded ( ae ) .",
    "these three phases meet at a multicritical point . in these calculations",
    "a condition @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the step fugacity and @xmath31 the boltzmann factor for the monomer - monomer attraction ) is used .",
    "this condition is valid only at the collapsed phase boundary .",
    "therefore only the phase boundaries separating the dc phase from the ae and de phases were obtained by these calculations .",
    "the phase boundary separating the de phase from the ae phase has been obtained numerically by veal @xmath32 @xcite . since the transition from the dc phase to the sag phase takes place in the region where @xmath33 the calculations based on the transfer matrix could not show this transition .",
    "we consider partially directed self - attracting self - avoiding walks ( pdsasaws ) on a square lattice restricted to quarter space .",
    "walk starts from the corner of the surface .",
    "let @xmath34 be the number of pdsaws with @xmath19 steps , having @xmath20 @xmath35 steps on the surface and @xmath36 nearest neighbours .",
    "we have obtained @xmath34 for @xmath37 for square lattice by exact enumeration method .",
    "we prefer this technique because in this case the scaling corrections are correctly taken into account by a suitable extrapolation scheme @xcite .",
    "we associate energy @xmath5 with each monomer on the surface and @xmath38 for the monomer - monomer interaction .",
    "partition function of the attached chain is @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath42 for attractive force .",
    "reduced free energy for the chain can be written as @xmath43 in general it is appropriate to assume that as @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the effective coordination number and @xmath47 is the universal configurational exponents for walks with one end attached to the surface .",
    "the value of @xmath46 can be estimated using ratio method @xcite with associated neville table or any other method such as pade analysis @xcite or differential approximants @xcite .    from equations ( 2.2 ) and",
    "( 2.3 ) we can write @xmath48    @xmath49 is calculated from the data of @xmath34 using equation ( 2.1 ) for a given @xmath50 and @xmath31 . from this",
    "we construct linear and quadratic extrapolants of the ratio of @xmath49 for the adjacent values of @xmath19 as well as the alternate one .",
    "results for alternate @xmath19 give better convergence .",
    "when @xmath51 and @xmath52 the value of @xmath53 is found to be 2.39 .    the surface critical exponent @xmath54 can be calculated using the relation @xcite @xmath55 and the end - to - end distance exponent @xmath56 using the relation @xmath57 where the superscript  0 \" indicates that the quantities correspond to the bulk without the surface and @xmath58 is the end - to - end distance of a chain of @xmath19 monomers .",
    "the value of @xmath59 at which polymer gets adsorbed / attached to the surface for a given value of @xmath31 is found from the @xmath60 plot of @xmath61 which remains equal to zero until @xmath62 and increases consistently as a function of @xmath50 for @xmath63 @xmath2 from the plot of @xmath64 at constant @xmath31 and @xmath3 from the plot of @xmath65 as a function of @xmath50 for different @xmath19 .",
    "the value of @xmath66 found from the plot of @xmath67 is slightly lower than the peak value of @xmath68 .",
    "it is , however , observed that as @xmath19 is increased from @xmath69 to @xmath0 the peak value shifts to smaller @xmath50 and appears to converge on the value of @xmath50 found from @xmath67 plot .",
    "we therefore choose the value of @xmath66 found from the plot of @xmath70 and determine lines @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) by this method . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the value of @xmath66 is = @xmath73 which is in very good agreement with the value @xmath74 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in another approach equation ( 2.5 )",
    "is used to calculate @xmath65 for different @xmath19 and the values are plotted as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "the value of @xmath66 is found from the intersection of successive approximation to @xmath65 in the limit @xmath75 .",
    "this method , however , fails for @xmath31 values above the @xmath76-point , _",
    "i. e. _ where the desorbed phase is in a collapsed globule state . below the @xmath76-point",
    "both the methods yield same values of @xmath66 which are in very good agreement .",
    "the phase boundary separating the expanded and collapsed phases is calculated from the plot of @xmath77 as a function of @xmath31 for a given @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath78 measures the energy arising due to monomer - monomer attractions .",
    "this is however , not zero in the expanded phase and , therefore , can not be used as an order parameter for the expanded and collapsed transition . we , however , find that the value of @xmath79 as a function of @xmath31 shows sudden rise at certain value of @xmath31 .",
    "we locate this point from the peak of @xmath80 which corresponds to a specific heat peak and shows divergence as @xmath75 . for @xmath52 , the value of @xmath81 is 3.30 which is in good agreement with the value 3.38 found by exact calculation",
    ". the method is found to work for all values of @xmath50 _",
    "i.e _ in both the bulk and the adsorbed regimes .",
    "however , as @xmath50 is increased the values of @xmath82 do not remain as smooth as at lower values of @xmath50 , therefore introducing some inaccuracy in the values of @xmath81 .",
    "the values of @xmath83 at the multicritical point found by us are @xmath84 which are in good agreement with exactly known values @xmath85 .",
    "as @xmath50 and @xmath31 becomes larger , higher order terms in equation ( 2.1 ) become significant and therefore to have proper convergence more terms must be considered .",
    "this explains the difference in @xmath86 line found by exact calculation @xcite and the present calculation ( see fig .",
    "the phase diagram shown in fig .",

    "solid line curve corresponds to present calculation and the dotted line to ref .",
    "@xcite . *",
    "the special adsorption line @xmath66 separates adsorbed expanded ( ae ) phase from that of desorbed expanded ( de ) . beyond @xmath76-point",
    "we have two boundaries @xmath87 and @xmath86 .",
    "the line @xmath87 separates the desorbed collapsed ( dc ) bulk phase from that of a surface attached globule ( sag ) state , whereas the boundary @xmath86 separates the sag phase from the ae phase .",
    "the point where @xmath81 line meets the special adsorption line @xmath66 , all four phases ae , de , dc and sag coexist .",
    "the sag phase which exists between the boundaries @xmath87 and @xmath86 for @xmath88 is essentially a two - dimensional globule sticking to the surface in the same way as a liquid droplet may lie on a partially wet surface .",
    "these features are in agreement with those of isotropic ( non directed ) polymer chain .",
    "the average fraction of monomer on the surface and the average number of pairs are calculated using the relations . @xmath89",
    "the results are shown in figs . @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the transition points on each curve is marked by dots .",
    "the dot on a curve of @xmath92 ( in fig .",
    "4 ) indicates adsorption or polymer chain getting attached to the surface ( _ i.e _ @xmath66 and @xmath87 lines depending on the values of @xmath31 ) , the dot on a curve @xmath93 ( in fig .",
    "5 ) indicates the collapsed - expanded states transition ( _ i .",
    "point on line @xmath81 and @xmath86 depending on the values of @xmath50 ) .",
    "we may note that the value of @xmath93 for sag phase is comparable to that in the dc phase .",
    "* fig.4 ; average fraction of monomers on the surface @xmath92 as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "dot on the curve represents transition point . *",
    "we have found that along the line @xmath66 and @xmath87 , @xmath94 and along the line @xmath81 and @xmath86 , @xmath95 .",
    "* fig.5 ; average number of pairs @xmath93 as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "dot on the curve represents the transition point . *",
    "it is obvious from these results that when the chain gets adsorbed from the expanded bulk state ( _ i.e _ for @xmath96 ) , it acquires a conformation at @xmath97 such that a small fraction of monomers get attached to the surface and others forms a layer parallel to the surface .",
    "this affects the free energy of the system . at the transition",
    "point the polymer chain fluctuates between adsorbed and desorbed conformations .",
    "therefore one may get peak in @xmath98 at @xmath99 which shows divergence as @xmath75 .",
    "as @xmath50 is increased for the same value of @xmath31 , the fluctuations along the normal to the surface get suppressed and at large @xmath100 the chain lies on the surface with very little fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "when the adsorbing chain was in collapsed bulk state , then at @xmath101 the collapsed chain gets attached to the surface . here",
    "again the number of monomers getting attached to the surface are small . since for @xmath102",
    "the globule may be any where in the available space and get attached to the surface at @xmath103 , there is a breaking of translational invariance at @xmath103 for @xmath104 the chain remains in the form of a globule attached to the surface . in this range",
    "the monomer - monomer attraction remains effective in holding the monomers in the neighbourhood of each other than the surface - monomer attraction whose tendency is to spread the chain on the surface .",
    "since at @xmath103 the globule retains its shape there is no change in the bulk free energy . only the surface contribution to the free energy which was zero for @xmath105 starts contributing .",
    "therefore , in this case we may therefore not see divergence in the bulk specific heat peak in the @xmath75 limit . for @xmath106",
    "the globule conformation becomes unstable as surface - monomer attraction becomes more effective than the monomer - monomer attraction and therefore the chain spreads over the surface ( just like a liquid droplet spreads over a wetting surface ) .",
    "summarizing we studied a polymer chain immersed in a poor solvent in the presence of an attracting impenetrable wall and obtained the phase boundaries separating different phases of the polymer chain from data obtained by exact enumerations .",
    "we report a state in between the desorbed collapsed and adsorbed phases which has conformation of a compact globule sticking to a surface in same way as a droplet may lie on a partially wet surface .",
    "a similar phase also been found in case of isotropic ( non directed ) polymer chain in both two and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the number of monomers on the surface and the number of nearest neighbors in different regimes of the phase diagram are obtained .",
