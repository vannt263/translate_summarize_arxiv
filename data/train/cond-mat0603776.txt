    "the study of the strongly correlated electronic systems in two dimensions ( 2d ) has been a very active and interesting problem since the discovery of the high @xmath3 superconductors , in which calculation of the electronic structures of these materials by the first principles methods is a first step toward a microscopic understanding of them . among these materials ,",
    "the sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 is an idea paradigm since it has an extremely weak coupling between its cuo@xmath0 planes , and is thus a more exaggerated quasi-2d system than the most other high-@xmath3 materials .",
    "experimental and theoretical efforts have been made to investigate electronic structures of the sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 .",

    "@xcite made a measurement on the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) above its nel temperature @xmath4k and got its energy band dispersion relations , which are in consistent with the @xmath5 model calculations along some k - paths but not all . to achieve more precise results , kim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite managed successfully to do the arpes experiments on the sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 at 150k , which is below its nel temperature , and found that it would be better to include the second and third nearest neighbor hopping terms , i.e. , to use the @xmath6 model  @xcite , for well describing the observed phenomenon .",
    "the first principles calculation is an important theoretical method to get information on the ground state of materials .",

    "@xcite used the linear combination of atomic orbital ( lcao ) method to calculate the electronic structure of the sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 in an afm structure .",
    "their results give out reasonable density of states ( dos ) to some extent , but do not show the dispersion relationship .",

    "@xcite also studied the sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 by fp - lmto numerical calculation without taking into account its magnetic structure and the strong correlation effect of cu @xmath2 electrons .",
    "so , in this paper we try to do a more detailed study on the afm sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 with the fp - lapw  @xcite method within the local - spin - density approximation and plus the on - site coulomb interaction on cu @xmath2 orbitals . then , based on this and within the electric - dipole approximation , its linear optical responses are also calculated .",
    "a lot of works  @xcite , mostly are model calculations and experimental measurements , had been done to study its optical properties for many years in order to understand the microscopic mechanism of the high-@xmath7 superconductivity exhibited in the layered copper oxides . as to our best knowledge , there is still no first - principles calculation study on its optical properties .",
    "our result gives out a broad peak at the charge transfer ( _ ct _ ) gap , which is the dominant optical absorption feature in these materials , and other peaks in higher energy range , which are also well comparable with the experimental data .",
    "fp - lapw  @xcite method treats all electrons without the shape approximations for the potential and charge density .",
    "the perdew - wang s exchange - correlation energies are used in the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite . in our calculation",

    "2 , it is seen that there is an indirect band gap of about 1.2 ev with the top of the valence band at m(@xmath21/2 , @xmath21/2 ) point and the bottom of conduction band at x(@xmath21 , 0 ) point , which is smaller than the experimental value of 1.9 ev  @xcite , but much closer to it than the value of 0.84 ev when @xmath1= 5 ev in ref . [ 8 ] .",
    "if a larger @xmath1=7.5 ev is selected and other parameters are unchanged , an indirect gap of 1.68 ev is obtained , which is very close to the value of 1.63 ev obtained by the lcao method  @xcite .",
    "the energy dispersion relation agrees very well with the results in ref . [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] .",
    "but , along the direction from x(@xmath22 , 0 ) to @xmath23(0 , 0 ) it is better than that obtained from the @xmath5 model calculation  @xcite .",
    "the energy dispersion of the top - most valence band along @xmath23(0 , 0 ) to m(@xmath22/2 , @xmath22/2 ) reaches to about 0.45 ev , larger than the experimental value of 280@xmath2460 mev  @xcite . but",
    "calculation with @xmath1=7.5 ev shows that a larger @xmath1 will suppress the dispersion to 0.32 ev , which is much closer to the experimental value .",
    "anti - ferromagnetic order of sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "the total spin is zero because both of cu1 and cu2 have anti - parallel spin moments of about 0.59 @xmath25 per atom , which is also bigger than the experimental value 0.34 @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the larger @xmath1 of 7.5 ev will increase the spin moment of cu atom to 0.63 @xmath25 per atom .",

    "oppositely it is seen from fig .",
    "4(a ) that the cu @xmath30 occupies more of the lowest conduction band with its component being about 69.4% . in the case of @xmath1=7.5 ev",
    ", the o 2p component increases to 65.6% at the top of the valence band and cu @xmath30 occupies more to 70.6% of the lowest conduction band , which indicates that sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 is a charge transfer insulator .",
    "thus the transition from o 2p to cu @xmath30 orbitals will dominate the absorption edge .",
    "the cl 3p orbital hybridizes with cu 3d orbital in the range of from -5 to -3 ev , mostly with cu @xmath29 and @xmath27 orbitals ( see fig .",
    "3(d ) , fig .",
    "4 ( b ) and ( d ) ) , all which are in the plane perpendicular to the cu - o plane .",
    "the hybridization between cl and cu is less than that of cu and o because o 2p orbitals extends more than cl 3p , and so hybridizes more with cu 3d orbitals .",
    "cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    study of optical property can give more informations on the electronic structures . in fig .",
    "5 , absorption spectrum calculated with @xmath1=6.0 ev are presented .",
    "although @xmath1=7.5 ev gives the similar spectrum shapes , but all the peaks would shift to higher energy by about 0.4 ev .",
    "so , we prefer to take @xmath1=6.0 ev as an example in the following discussion . comparing it with the experimental data given by r. lvenich _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite and moskvin _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite , we find that they match very well near the charge transfer gap of about 2ev , corresponding to electrons transferred from o 2p to cu 3d orbitals , which can be clearly seen from the band structure in fig . 2 along the path from x(@xmath21 , 0 ) to m(@xmath21/2 , @xmath21/2 ) .",
    "around 2.5 ev , there is one lower peak in both our calculation and ref . [",
    "15 ] , which was deemed by moskvin _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite as the other part of the double - peak structure of the lowest excitation .",
    "the third strong and broad peak appears at about 3.5 ev . according to the idea of pothuizen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , a nonbonding band ( nbb ) , mostly o 2p@xmath31 orbitals , lies at about 1.5 ev below the zhang - rice band ( zrb ) , so the energy needed to transfer an electron from nbb to cu 3d is about 3.5 ev , which is also shown by moskvin _",
    "_ in their experimental observations .",
    "again , the broad peak around 4.6 ev appears both in our fist - principles result and their measurements .",
    "since the cu @xmath30 occupies the lowest part of the conduction band from fermi level to about 1.5 ev , and cl @xmath32 dominates the most states between -4.5 and -2.5 ev , the quite broad peak around 4.6 ev can be ascribed to the hopping of electrons from cl @xmath32 orbitals to cu @xmath30 orbitals , which can be clearly seen from fig . 3 ( b ) , ( d ) and fig .",
    "usually , the cuo@xmath33 model calculation on the sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath34 has just neglected the cl effect by replacing the cl atom by the o atom , while here we have shown the contribution of cl atoms to the optical properties of the sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath34 .",
    "finally , we want to emphasize that correct choice of @xmath1 value is critical for the lsda+@xmath1 calculation .",
    "one criterion is whether the chosen @xmath1 value can give a reasonable physical result in consistent with the experimental observation .",
    "combining our obtained results with that in ref .",
    "[ 8 ] for @xmath1=5.0 ev , we can see that @xmath1=6.0 and 7.5 ev are both physically reasonable although the former has been selected for the main discussion on sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 s optical properties . and",
    "it is clear that larger @xmath1 influences cu @xmath2 orbital more than o @xmath35 , and causes a wider gap , less band dispersion and a bigger magnetic moment on cu .",
    "also , larger @xmath1 shifts the absorption edge to higher energy .",
    "in summary , we have given a more detailed first - principle calculations on the band structure and linear optical properties of the afm sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath34 by using the lsda+@xmath1 approach in the fp - lapw formalism .",
    "the obtained results indicate that it is a charge - transfer insulator with an indirect gap of about 1.2 ev , which is less than the experimental value .",
    "the @xmath36 _ vs. _ k relationship agrees very well to the arpes observations . also , we have found that our calculated linear optical susceptibility is well consistent with the experimental data not only around the charge - transfer gap , but also in the higher energy range .",
    "the authors thank support to this work from a grant for state key program of china through grant no .",
    "in addition , h. m. weng thanks a valuable discussion with dr .",
    "meichun qian about the fp - lapw calculations .",
