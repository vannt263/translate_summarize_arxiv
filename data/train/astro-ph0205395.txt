    "as in classical general relativity we start our discussion in flat spacevelocity which will then be generalized to curved space .    the flat - spacevelocity cosmological",
    "metric is given by @xmath4 here @xmath5 is hubble s time , the inverse of hubble s constant , as given by measurements in the limit of zero distances and thus zero gravity .",
    "as such , @xmath5 is a constant , in fact a universal constant ( its numerical value is given in section 8 , @xmath6gyr ) .",
    "its role in cosmology theory resembles that of @xmath7 , the speed of light in vacuum , in ordinary special relativity .",
    "the velocity @xmath8 is used here in the sense of cosmology , as in hubble s law , and is usually not the time - derivative of the distance .",
    "the universe expansion is obtained from the metric ( 1 ) as a null condition , @xmath9 .",
    "using spherical coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 for the metric ( 1 ) , and the fact that the universe is spherically symmetric ( @xmath13 ) , the null condition then yields @xmath14 , or upon integration and using appropriate initial conditions , gives @xmath15 or @xmath16 , i.e. the hubble law in the zero - gravity limit .",
    "based on the metric ( 1 ) a cosmological special relativity ( csr ) was presented in the text @xcite ( see chapter 2 ) . in this theory",
    "the receding velocities of galaxies and the distances between them in the hubble expansion are united into a four - dimensional pseudo - euclidean manifold , similarly to space and time in ordinary special relativity .",
    "the hubble law is assumed and is written in an invariant way that enables one to derive a four - dimensional transformation which is similar to the lorentz transformation .",
    "the parameter in the new transformation is the ratio between the cosmic time to @xmath5 ( in which the cosmic time is measured backward with respect to the present time ) .",
    "accordingly , the new transformation relates physical quantities at different cosmic times in the limit of weak or negligible gravitation .    the transformation between the four variables @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath8 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( assuming @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) is given by @xmath26 equations ( 2 ) are the _ cosmological transformation _ and very much resemble the well - known lorentz transformation . in csr it is the relative cosmic time which takes the role of the relative velocity in einstein s special relativity .",
    "the transformation ( 2 ) leaves invariant the hubble time @xmath5 , just as the lorentz transformation leaves invariant the speed of light in vacuum @xmath7 .",
    "a cosmological general theory of relativity , suitable for the large - scale structure of the universe , was subsequently developed @xcite . in the framework of cosmological general relativity ( cgr )",
    "gravitation is described by a curved four - dimensional riemannian spacevelocity .",
    "cgr incorporates the hubble constant @xmath5 at the outset .",
    "the hubble law is assumed in cgr as a fundamental law .",
    "cgr , in essence , extends hubble s law so as to incorporate gravitation in it ; it is actually a _ distribution theory _ that relates distances and velocities between galaxies .",
    "the theory involves only measured quantities and it takes a picture of the universe as it is at any moment .",
    "the foundations of any gravitational theory are based on the principle of equivalence and the principle of general covariance @xcite .",
    "these two principles lead immediately to the realization that gravitation should be described by a four - dimensional curved spacetime , in our theory spacevelocity , and that the field equations and the equations of motion should be written in a generally covariant form .",
    "hence these principles were adopted in cgr also .",
    "use is made in a four - dimensional riemannian manifold with a metric @xmath27 and a line element @xmath28 .",
    "the difference from einstein s general relativity is that our coordinates are : @xmath29 is a velocitylike coordinate ( rather than a timelike coordinate ) , thus @xmath30 where @xmath5 is the hubble time in the zero - gravity limit and @xmath8 the velocity .",
    "the coordinate @xmath30 is the comparable to @xmath31 where @xmath7 is the speed of light and @xmath32 is the time in ordinary general relativity .",
    "the other three coordinates @xmath33 , @xmath34 , are spacelike , just as in general relativity theory .",
    "an immediate consequence of the above choice of coordinates is that the null condition @xmath9 describes the expansion of the universe in the curved spacevelocity ( generalized hubble s law with gravitation ) as compared to the propagation of light in the curved spacetime in general relativity .",
    "this means one solves the field equations ( to be given in the sequel ) for the metric tensor , then from the null condition @xmath9 one obtains immedialety the dependence of the relative distances between the galaxies on their relative velocities .    as usual in gravitational theories , one equates geometry to physics .",
    "the first is expressed by means of a combination of the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar , and follows to be naturally either the ricci trace - free tensor or the einstein tensor .",
    "the ricci trace - free tensor does not fit gravitation in general , and the einstein tensor is a natural candidate .",
    "the physical part is expressed by the energy - momentum tensor which now has a different physical meaning from that in einstein s theory .",
    "more important , the coupling constant that relates geometry to physics is now also _",
    "different_.    accordingly the field equations are @xmath35 exactly as in einstein s theory , with @xmath36 given by @xmath37 , ( in general relativity it is given by @xmath38 ) , where @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 , with @xmath41 being newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath5 the hubble constant time .",
    "when the equations of motion will be written in terms of velocity instead of time , the constant @xmath39 will replace @xmath41 . using the above equations one then has @xmath42 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath43 is constructed , along the lines of general relativity theory , with the speed of light being replaced by the hubble constant time . if @xmath44 is the average mass density of the universe , then it will be assumed that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the four - velocity . in general relativity theory",
    "one takes @xmath47 . in newtonian gravity",
    "one has the poisson equation @xmath48 . at points",
    "where @xmath49 one solves the vacuum einstein field equations in general relativity and the laplace equation @xmath50 in newtonian gravity . in both theories",
    "a null ( zero ) solution is allowed as a trivial case . in cosmology",
    ", however , there exists no situation at which @xmath44 can be zero because the universe is filled with matter . in order to be able to have zero on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 3 ) one takes @xmath51 not as equal to @xmath44 , but to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the critical mass density , a _",
    "constant _ in cgr given by @xmath54 , whose value is @xmath55 , a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter .",
    "accordingly one takes @xmath56 for the energy - momentum tensor .    in the next sections we apply cgr to obtain the accelerating expanding universe and related subjects",
    "in the four - dimensional spacevelocity the spherically symmetric metric is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are functions of @xmath8 and @xmath10 alone , and comoving coordinates @xmath60 have been used . with the above choice of coordinates , the zero - component of the geodesic equation becomes an identity , and since @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants along the geodesics , one has @xmath61 and therefore @xmath62 the metric ( 5 ) shows that the area of the sphere @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 and that @xmath59 should satisfy @xmath65 .",
    "the possibility that @xmath66 at a point @xmath67 is excluded since it would allow the lines @xmath68 at the neighboring points @xmath67 and @xmath69 to coincide at @xmath67 , thus creating a caustic surface at which the comoving coordinates break down .    as has been shown in the previous sections the universe expands by the null condition @xmath9 , and",
    "if the expansion is spherically symmetric one has @xmath70 .",
    "the metric ( 5 ) then yields @xmath71 thus @xmath72 this is the differential equation that determines the universe expansion . in the following",
    "we solve the gravitational field equations in order to find out the function @xmath73 .",
    "the gravitational field equations ( 3 ) , written in the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 with @xmath52 and @xmath76 , are now solved .",
    "( 6 ) one finds that the only nonvanishing components of @xmath77 are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and that @xmath82 .",
    "the only nonvanishing components of the ricci tensor yield ( dots and primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath8 and @xmath10 , respectively ) , using eq .",
    "( 9 ) , the following field equations : @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89    the field equations obtained for the components 00 , 01 , 11 , and 22 ( the 33 component contributes no new information ) are given by @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93\\ ] ] @xmath94 it is convenient to eliminate the term with the second velocity - derivative of @xmath58 from the above equations",
    ". this can easily be done , and combinations of eqs .",

    "substituting ( 19 ) in the other two field equations ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) then gives @xmath103 @xmath104 respectively .",
    "the simplest solution of the above two equations , which satisfies the condition @xmath105 , is given by @xmath106 using eq .",
    "( 22 ) in eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 21 ) gives @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( 24 ) is the sum of the solutions of the homogeneous equation @xmath109 and a particular solution of eq .",
    "these are given by @xmath110 and @xmath111    the solution @xmath112 represents a particle at the origin of coordinates and as such is not relevant to our problem .",
    "we take , accordingly , @xmath113 as the general solution , @xmath114 @xmath115 using the values of @xmath42 and @xmath54 , we obtain @xmath116 where @xmath117 .    the two solutions given by eqs .",
    "( 23 ) and ( 29 ) for @xmath118 can now be equated , giving @xmath119 furthermore , from eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 22 ) we find that @xmath120    it will be recalled that the universe expansion is determined by eq .",
    "( 8) , @xmath121 .",
    "the only thing that is left to be determined is the signs of @xmath122 or the pressure @xmath123 .",
    "thus we have @xmath124 for simplicity we confine ourselves to the linear approximation , thus eq .",
    "( 32 ) yields @xmath125.\\eqno(33)\\ ] ]    the second term in the square bracket in the above equation represents the deviation due to gravity from the standard hubble law . for without that term , eq .",
    "( 33 ) reduces to @xmath14 , thus @xmath126 . the constant can be taken zero if one assumes , as usual , that at @xmath127 the velocity should also vanish .",
    "thus @xmath15 , or @xmath16 ( since @xmath128 ) .",
    "accordingly , the equation of motion ( 33 ) describes the expansion of the universe when @xmath129 , namely when @xmath130 .",
    "the equation then coincides with the standard hubble law .",
    "we will not go through that and the reader is referred to appendix a of ref . 1 .",
    "to see the physical meaning of these solutions , however , one does not need the exact solutions .",
    "rather , it is enough to write down the solutions in the lowest approximation in @xmath131 .",
    "one obtains , by differentiating eq .",
    "( 33 ) with respect to @xmath8 , for @xmath132 , @xmath133 the solution of which is @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 and @xmath137 are constants .",
    "the latter can be determined by the initial condition @xmath138 and @xmath139 , thus @xmath140 this is obviously a closed universe , and presents a decelerating expansion .",
    "for @xmath141 we have @xmath142 whose solution , using the same initial conditions , is @xmath143 where @xmath144 .",
    "this is now an open accelerating universe .    for @xmath129",
    "we have , of course , @xmath15 .",
    "we finally determine which of the three cases of expansion is the one at present epoch of time . to this end",
    "we have to write the solutions ( 36 ) and ( 38 ) in ordinary hubble s law form @xmath16 .",
    "expanding eqs .",
    "( 36 ) and ( 38 ) in power series in @xmath145 and keeping terms up to the second order , we obtain @xmath146 for @xmath132 and @xmath141 , respectively .",

    "( 39 ) then reduce into the single equation @xmath149.\\eqno(40)\\ ] ] inverting now this equation by writing it as @xmath16 , we obtain in the lowest approximation @xmath150,\\eqno(41)\\ ] ] where @xmath151 .",
    "to the same approximation one also obtains @xmath152=h\\left[1-\\left(1-\\omega_m \\right)r^2/6c^2\\tau^2\\right],\\eqno(42)\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the redshift parameter . as is seen , and it is confirmed by experiments , @xmath153 depends on the distance it is being measured ; it has physical meaning only at the zero - distance limit , namely when measured _ locally _ , in which case it becomes @xmath154 .",
    "it follows that the measured value of @xmath153 depends on the  short \" and  long \" distance scales @xcite .",
    "the farther the distance @xmath153 is being measured , the lower the value for @xmath153 is obtained . by eq .",
    "( 42 ) this is possible only when @xmath141 , namely when the universe is accelerating . by eq .",
    "( 30 ) we also find that the pressure is positive .",
    "the possibility that the universe expansion is accelerating was first predicted using cgr by the author in 1996 [ 2 ] before the supernovae experiments results became known .    it will be noted that the constant expansion is just a transition stage between the decelerating and the accelerating expansions as the universe evolves toward its present situation .",
    "figure 1 ( behar and carmeli ) describes the hubble diagram of the above solutions for the three types of expansion for values of @xmath155 from 100 to 0.245 .",
    "the figure describes the three - phase evolution of the universe .",
    "curves ( 1)-(5 ) represent the stages of _ decelerating expansion _ according to eq .",
    "as the density of matter @xmath44 decreases , the universe goes over from the lower curves to the upper ones , but it does not have enough time to close up to a big crunch .",
    "the universe subsequently goes over to curve ( 6 ) with @xmath129 , at which time it has a constant expansion for a fraction of a second .",
    "this then followed by going to the upper curves ( 7 ) and ( 8) with @xmath141 , where the universe expands with _ acceleration _ according to eq .",
    "8 fits the present situation of the universe . for curves ( 1)-(4 ) in the diagram we use the cutoff when the curves were at their maximum . in table 1",
    "we present the cosmic times with respect to the big bang , the cosmic radiation temperature and the pressure for each of the curves in fig .",
    "figure 2 ( riess _ et al . _ ) shows the experimental results .    to summarize",
    ", a theory of cosmology has been presented in which the dynamical variables are those of hubble , i.e. distances and velocities .",
    "the theory describes the universe as having a three - phase evolution with a decelerating expansion , followed by a constant and an accelerating expansion , and it predicts that the universe is now in the latter phase . as the density of matter decreases , while the universe is at the decelerating phase , it does not have enough time to close up to a big crunch .",
    "rather , it goes to the constant - expansion phase , and then to the accelerating stage .",
    "as we have seen , the equation obtained for the universe expansion , eq .",
    "( 38 ) , is very simple .",
    "the einstein gravitational field equations with the added cosmological term are @xcite : @xmath156 where @xmath3 is the cosmological constant , the value of which is supposed to be determined by experiment . in eq .",
    "( 43 ) @xmath157 and @xmath59 are the ricci tensor and scalar , respectively , @xmath158 , where @xmath41 is newton s constant and the speed of light is taken as unity .",
    "recently the two groups ( the _ supernovae cosmology project _ and the _ high - z supernova team _ ) concluded that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "the two groups had discovered and measured moderately high redshift ( @xmath159 ) supernovae , and found that they were fainter than what one would expect them to be if the cosmos expansion were slowing down or constant . both teams obtained @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and ruled out the traditional ( @xmath155 , @xmath162)=(1 , 0 ) universe .",
    "their value for the density parameter @xmath162 corresponds to a cosmological constant that is small but , nevertheless , nonzero and positive , @xmath163    in previous sections a four - dimensional cosmological theory ( cgr ) was presented .",
    "although the theory has no cosmological constant , it predicts that the universe accelerates and hence it has the equivalence of a positive cosmological constant in einstein s general relativity . in the framework of this theory ( see section 2 ) the zero - zero component of the field equations ( 3 ) is written as @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the critical mass density and @xmath5 is hubble s time in the zero - gravity limit .    comparing eq .",
    "( 44 ) with the zero - zero component of eq .",
    "( 43 ) , one obtains the expression for the cosmological constant of general relativity , @xmath166    to find out the numerical value of @xmath5 we use the relationship between @xmath151 and @xmath153 given by eq .",
    "( 42 ) ( cr denote values according to cosmological relativity ) : @xmath167,\\eqno(45)\\ ] ] where @xmath168 is the redshift and @xmath169 with @xmath170 .",
    "( notice that our @xmath171 is different from the standard @xmath53 defined with @xmath153 . )",
    "the redshift parameter @xmath19 determines the distance at which @xmath153 is measured .",
    "we choose @xmath172 and take for @xmath173 its value at the present time ( see table 1 ) ( corresponds to 0.32 in the standard theory ) , eq .",
    "( 45 ) then gives @xmath174 at the value @xmath172 the corresponding hubble parameter @xmath153 according to the latest results from hst can be taken @xcite as @xmath175km / s - mpc , thus @xmath176km / s - mpc , or @xmath177 and @xmath178    what is left is to find the value of @xmath179 .",
    "we have @xmath180 , where @xmath181 and @xmath170 .",
    "thus @xmath182 , or @xmath183 as is seen from the above one has @xmath184 which means the universe is euclidean .    as a final result",
    "we calculate the cosmological constant in the form @xmath185    our results confirm those of the supernovae experiments and indicate on the existance of the dark energy as has recently received confirmation from the boomerang cosmic microwave background experiment @xcite , which showed that the universe is euclidean .",
    "in this paper the cosmological general relativity , a relativistic theory in spacevelocity , has been presented and applied to the problem of the expansion of the universe .",
    "the theory , which predicts a positive pressure for the universe now , describes the universe as having a three - phase evolution : decelerating , constant and accelerating expansion , but it is now in the latter stage .",
    "furthermore , the cosmological constant that was extracted from the theory agrees with the experimental result .",
    "finally , it has also been shown that the three - dimensional spatial space of the universe is euclidean , again in agreement with observations .",
    "recently @xcite , more confirmation to the universe accelerating expansion came from the most distant supernova , sn 1997ff , that was recorded by the hubble space telescope .",
    "as has been pointed out before , if we look back far enough , we should find a decelerating expansion ( curves 1 - 5 in figure 1 ) . beyond @xmath172",
    "one should see an earlier time when the mass density was dominant .",
    "the measurements obtained from sn 1997ff s redshift and brightness provide a direct proof for the transition from past decelerating to present accelerating expansion ( see figure 3 , riess _",
    "et al . _ ) .",
    "the measurements also exclude the possibility that the acceleration of the universe is not real but is due to other astrophysical effects such as dust .",
