    "the localization properties of non - relativistic electrons moving in a two - dimensional disordered system in the presence of static random magnetic fields ( rmf ) with zero mean have been discussed controversially for more than a decade .",
    "investigations of anderson localization of 2d electrons with random complex hopping matrix elements date back to the early eighties @xcite .",
    "the actual study of this model was particularly inspired by physical situations encountered in high-@xmath2 superconductors and for composite - fermions in the quantum hall effect at half filling factor .",
    "now , for lattice models of width @xmath3 and length @xmath4 with _ uncorrelated _ random magnetic fields the results gradually seem to converge to the notion that all states are localized ( see , e.g. , @xcite and papers quoted therein ) . in the absence of diagonal disorder ,",
    "the localization length for systems with @xmath3 odd is believed to diverge at @xmath5 @xcite , where the eigenstates are suggested to become critical @xcite .",
    "this special state at @xmath5 is a consequence of the chiral symmetry @xcite which can be broken by diagonal disorder or , as reported in the case of quasi-1d systems , by application of periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the random - flux model was shown to exhibit the same symmetry @xcite as the gade - wegner model @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior is supposed to be similar to that of dirac fermions with random gauge fields @xcite .",
    "recently , a metal - insulator transition has been asserted for the lattice random - flux model incorporating _ spatially - correlated _ random magnetic fields and additional diagonal disorder @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was based on a finite - size scaling study of the longitudinal conductance which was calculated numerically .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we check the alleged metal - insulator transition by investigating the scaling behavior of the eigenvalue statistics .",
    "second , the spatial fluctuations of the eigenstates near energy @xmath5 are calculated and the scaling of the corresponding moments are analyzed . in the presence of diagonal disorder , we find only localized states for the spatially - correlated random flux model . due to the huge localization length",
    "the wave functions near the band center show multifractal behavior which , however , differs from the quantum hall case .",
    "a model of non - interacting electrons on a square lattice is considered in a one - band tight - binding approximation .",
    "the spatially - correlated random fluxes are generated as in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the strength and correlation length of the random magnetic fields .",
    "the uncorrelated random numbers @xmath9 are evenly distributed between @xmath10 and the @xmath11 denote the spatial positions of the flux plaquettes considered . the magnetic flux per plaquette , @xmath12 , enters the hamiltonian via the peierls phase factors in the transfer terms from site @xmath13 to the neighboring sites @xmath14 , @xmath15 the total flux through the plaquette labeled by @xmath16 is given by the sum of the phases @xmath17 associated with its four links .",
    "@xmath18 is taken as the unit of energy and the lattice constant @xmath19 as the unit of length .",
    "the diagonal disorder potentials @xmath20 are realized by a set of uncorrelated random numbers taken from the interval @xmath21 .",
    "the eigenvalues have been calculated for square lattices of size @xmath22 , 128 , 192 .",
    "in addition , some selected eigenstates were obtained for systems of size up to @xmath23 .",
    "the results of the level statistics are shown in fig .  [ i0_wl ] where the second moment , @xmath24 , of the level spacing distribution , @xmath0 , is plotted as a function of the system size @xmath4 and disorder strength @xmath25 .",
    "we take the same parameters as in @xcite so that the amplitude of the correlated random fields @xmath26 , the correlation length @xmath27 , and the fermi energy @xmath28 .",
    "the eigenvalues were calculated within the interval @xmath29 .",
    "many realizations have been considered such that the number of accumulated eigenvalues for each pair ( @xmath30 ) is @xmath31 .",
    "we find that for @xmath32 , @xmath33 increases with increasing size @xmath4 .",
    "this behavior is expected for localized eigenstates which in the limit @xmath34 obey the poisson statistics ( @xmath35 ) of uncorrelated energy levels . for @xmath36 no scale dependence is observed for the sizes investigated but @xmath33 equals the random matrix result @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the localization length considerably exceeds the system size @xmath4 .",
    "if there were a critical point below @xmath38 as suggested in @xcite , @xmath39 should be scale independent at the critical disorder @xmath40 _ and _ larger than @xmath41 .",
    "hence , we have to conclude that for the suggested parameters @xcite there is no localization - delocalization - transition in square systems .",
    "the corresponding single branch scaling curve is shown in the inset of fig  [ i0_wl ] .",
    "this result is similar to the situation found previously for the uncorrelated magnetic field case @xcite .",
    "the increase of the conductance for small @xmath42 in quasi-1d systems reported in @xcite is presumably a finite size effect because for narrow systems the increase in width @xmath3 may raise the conductance due to the additional transport channels . in the limit of large @xmath3 , however , quantum interference will eventually localize the conductance .",
    "turning now to the analysis of the eigenstates , we remind that the spatial fluctuations of critical eigenstates @xmath43 exhibit multifractal properties , i.e. , the scaling of the appropriate moments , @xmath44 , follow power - laws with an infinite set of unrelated exponents @xmath45 .",
    "alternatively , one considers the corresponding @xmath1-distribution which for @xmath46 can often be approximated by @xmath47 $ ] , where in 2d for our lattice system @xmath48 .",
    "hence , @xmath49 effectively characterizes the whole distribution .    in fig .",
    "[ falfa ] the @xmath1-distribution of an eigenstate near @xmath5 of the correlated random magnetic flux model is shown .",
    "similar results are obtained for even @xmath4 or different @xmath7 and @xmath8 parameters as long as the localization length considerably exceeds the system size . in most cases ,",
    "a parabola can be fitted with @xmath50 .",
    "this number is quite distinct from the value @xmath51 of a qhe - system @xcite . from the scaling of the second moment",
    "we find a fractal dimension @xmath52 for the correlated random magnetic field case which also differs from the qhe value 1.6 @xcite .",
    "our values for _ spatially - correlated _ rmf are similar to those reported for the _ uncorrelated _ case .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite determined @xmath53 from the exponent @xmath54 of the temporal decay of the autocorrelation function using the relation @xmath55 @xcite , and @xmath56 was extrapolated in ref .",
    "@xcite from a multifractal analysis similar to ours .",
    "multifractal wave functions have also been reported @xcite for massless dirac fermions near @xmath5 with a @xmath1-distribution very close to the one shown here .",
    "we find two exceptions to the multifractal behavior at @xmath57 discussed above .",
    "first , in the presence of diagonal disorder @xmath58 a tendency to strong localization can be observed which is fully developed for @xmath59 .",
    "second , if the amplitudes of the spatially - correlated ( @xmath27 ) random magnetic fields are weak , @xmath60 , the eigenstates for odd system size @xmath61 and @xmath62 appear to be extended ( @xmath63 ) which may be due to the small @xmath4 or an indication of the chiral unitary symmetry class ."
