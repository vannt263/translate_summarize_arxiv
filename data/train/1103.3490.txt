    "the comparison of hadronic collider ( @xmath0  collisions ) and electron collider ( @xmath2  collisions ) data have shown a clear discrepancy in the produced particle multiplicity for collisions measured at the same center - of - mass energy .",
    "this has long been explained by the observation that hadronic interactions can be decomposed in terms of `` collision products '' and `` leading hadrons ''  with the latter carrying away ( on average ) half of the total energy available for particle production  @xcite .",
    "it is found that one can unify these data by shifting the center - of - mass energy of the @xmath0  collisions to an effective center - of - mass energy , which is half of the original collision energy , empirically determined .",
    "superimposing central heavy ion data onto this agrees more closely with the @xmath2  data than the hadronic collision ( @xmath0 ) data  @xcite . combining all these observations",
    ", one can surmise that collisions in which all `` constituents '' of the proton are used ( i.e. no leading hadron ) will produce higher ( @xmath2-like ) multiplicities .",
    "the model presented here , originally described in ref .",
    "@xcite , uses these ideas as a premise to divide the participant region in heavy ion collisions into two distinct regions ; these are noted as `` mono '' and `` multi '' .",
    "a glauber model  @xcite is used to calculate the number of participants and the number of times each nucleon is struck by another from the opposing nucleus .",
    "mono refers to nucleons which undergo a single hit ",
    "similar to @xmath0  interactions , which presumably can `` liberate '' a leading hadron .",
    "multi refers to nucleons which are multiply struck ( by two or more ) nucleons , however , these are only counted once and thus do not accumulate as quickly as the number of binary collisions .",
    "this phenomenological approach is similar to the successful core / corona approach of epos  @xcite .",
    "the main technical difference surrounds the expected position with respect to the reaction plane , of the mono ( or corona ) nucleons .",
    "the current model expects that the peak of mono nucleons to be _ along _ the reaction plane ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : monomultipositions ] ) , whereas in the corona from epos is expected to peak 90@xmath3 away  @xcite .",
    "a more recent ` toy model ' implementation by the epos authors  @xcite , however , does use the same `` glauber - method '' to determine core ( multi ) and corona ( mono ) regions to describe the strangeness enhancement observed in au+au and cu+cu data . in that implementation no interactions between the core and corona regions is assumed , each `` corona '' contributes one - half of a minimum bias interaction .",
    "the authors note that fixing the mono ( corona ) is not necessary .",
    "however , although they undergo different assumptions , both can provide a good description of the data . where these models differ is in the extent to which they can be ( or at least have been ) applied and the possible origin of the two components , or regions , of the collision . by using the model presented here",
    ", it is possible to not only describe with success low-@xmath1  phenomenon observed in heavy ion collisions but also high-@xmath1  phenomena .",
    "this can lead to hints as to the origin of disappearing back - to - back jets and their reappearance at low-@xmath1 .",
    "the implementation of this model is very simple .",
    "a glauber model is used to count the number of times each nucleon is struck ( the glauber model implementation is similar to ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for each monte -",
    "carlo `` collision '' the nucleons are sorted into three categories : not hit ( spectators ) , singly hit nucleons ( @xmath4 ) , and multiply hit nucleons ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "spectators are not considered in this model .",
    "after many trials , and at all possible impact parameters , the average number of mono- and multi - assigned nucleons are calculated .",
    "figure  [ fig : monomultivsnpart ] illustrates the mean @xmath4  and @xmath5  found for au+au ( black circles ) and cu+cu ( grey ) collisions at @xmath6=200gev .",
    "@xmath4  and @xmath5  versus centrality are not found to appreciably change with collision energy , as shown by lines depicting @xmath4  and @xmath5  for 19.6gev collisions .    after calculating the number of mono and multi participants for a given centrality class it is possible to form the multiplicity ( and spectra , etc . ) corresponding to that data using the formula :    @xmath7    @xmath8 represents the modeled au+au data , @xmath9 is the yield expected from singly interacting nucleons ( ostensibly minimum bias @xmath0  data ) and @xmath10 is the yield expected from the multi underlying distribution . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fixed for a given data sample and do not change versus centrality .",
    "@xmath11 itself represents any distribution , for example multiplicity , charged hadron spectra , kinetic freeze - out temperature , or any other observable .    in this paper",
    ", we first explore the possible origin of the underlying multi distribution which could be from one of many different sources such as non - single diffractive ( nsd ) events ( unlikely as these may still have leading hadrons ) , high - multiplicity events ( for example greater than @xmath12/2 . ) , high-@xmath1  data ( @xmath13@xmath141.8 to represent the close - packedness of the multi nucleons ) , a gluon - only source distribution .",
    "we use each of these different hypotheses to test the systematic dependence ",
    "although not to choose a preferential particle production mechanism but rather to provide a proof of principle that one can reasonably reproduce the particle distributions in heavy ion collisions from these simple sources .",
    "we note that a single distribution for mono ( @xmath0  minimum bias ) and a single distribution for multi is assumed , which is sufficient to reproduce all the data versus centrality . the centrality dependence observed in the data is then entirely due to the interplay between @xmath4  and @xmath5 , fig .",
    "[ fig : monomultivsnpart ] , and not from a changing or modified underlying distribution .     the relative number of mono and multi collisions versus the number of participants .",
    "black ( grey ) circles represent au+au ( cu+cu ) collisions at 200gev ( @xmath15=42 mb ) ; closed and open symbols represent mono and multi collisions respectively . the values for 19.6gev",
    "( @xmath15=33 mb ) au+au data are depicted as lines for comparison.,scaledwidth=47.5% ]    secondly , as a more rigorous test , fits to the data to extract the underlying mono and multi distributions will be made .",
    "in fact this is necessary to analyze more exotic data than multiplicity and charged hadron spectra . in this way we decouple ourselves from ( for example ) pythia  @xcite to describe the detailed identified particle spectra . by using eqn .",
    "[ eqn : monomulti ] and the measured data to simultaneously extract the underlying distributions , both the modification to the @xmath0  minimum bias collisions at the surface ( mono ) as well as the true underlying multi distribution can be studied .",
    "as glauber has no recourse to produce particle distributions , this model has a purely phenomenological approach to describe the heavy ion experimental data .",
    "one important distinction to note for the current model versus many other two - component models is the absence of `` collision scaling '' .",
    "other two - component models assert that one component factorizes with the number of participants ( usually associated with soft particle production ) , and the second with the number of nucleon - nucleon interactions ( @xmath16   representing hard collisions ) within the collision  @xcite . in the current discussion , we assert that the number of collisions is not the correct scaling variable . if , as is hypothesized , upon collision the system becomes a hot , dense qcd matter then it may become difficult to reliably count individual nucleon - nucleon collisions . the currently accepted approach used to validate",
    "the number of collisions is to measure the spectrum of direct - photons in @xmath17+@xmath17 collisions , relative to that in @xmath0  interactions .",
    "as the direct photons are not expected to interact with the medium , it is assumed that the measured @xmath18=1 validates the use of @xmath16  @xcite , illustrating that the number of originally produced photons are consistent with @xmath0 . in more current data , however , the previously observed @xmath16  scaling at @xmath1@xmath196gev/@xmath20 is not seen at higher momenta  @xcite , even though punch - through high-@xmath1  hadrons are seen to escape the medium  @xcite . here",
    ", we set this @xmath16  scaling assumption aside .",
    "the number of mono and multi collisions in the current model is less susceptible to the assumptions needed in order to count the number of collisions , where our _ number _ reflects an interaction volume ( multi ) and simply the number of expected nucleon - nucleon scatterings on the surface ( mono ) .    for a low number of participants ( @xmath21@xmath2225 ) , the number of mono collisions exceeds that of multi , and vice - versa for a high @xmath21 . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : monomultivsnpart ] , the number of mono does not fall to zero even for the most central events where approximately  7% of the participants undergo only a single interaction .",
    "an important consequence in these calculations is that the sum of mono and multi , by definition , is fixed to be @xmath21 .",
    "this restricts the growth of multi , unlike the rapidly growing number of binary collisions , and results in multi ( and mono ) being more closely associated to a `` participant '' variable . in calculating the mono and multi",
    ", it is found that there is a strong dependence on the collision species , in contrast to the number of binary collisions ( @xmath16 ) which is essentially the same at the same @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , only a weak dependence on the collision energy ( inelastic @xmath0  cross - section ) is observed over the energy range of the rhic data , whereas a strong binary collision dependence on @xmath16  is noted .",
    "as the premise of this model uses the charged particle multiplicity to argue for distinct mono / multi regions of the collision volume it is natural to begin with a discussion of that experimental data .",
    "here , one can simply use the measured @xmath0  distribution as the mono and a second underlying distribution ( for example taken from pythia ) to represent the multi .",
    "we combine the mono / multi distributions ( and similarly for the next section ) as :    @xmath23    where @xmath4  and @xmath5  distributions for au+au collisions are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : monomultivsnpart ] .",
    "one can hypothesize that @xmath24 be @xmath25 ( i.e. precisely from minimum bias @xmath0  interactions ) or it can be a free parameter in the fit .",
    "for simplicity in this first case , we assume the former ; later , the latter is used to test for any modification of the underlying mono distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : multiplicityi ] shows the result of using this formalism with several hypothesized multi multiplicity distributions for au+au collisions at @xmath6=200gev . for the shown centrality bins from phobos  @xcite",
    ", one can see that the model provides a reasonable description of the data .",
    "remember that the same underlying distributions are used for both panels , only @xmath4  and @xmath5  are changed .",
    "this is not too surprising as the basic premise of this model is to reproduce the centrality dependence of the charged particle multiplicity in the context of an absence of leading hadrons in the multi region . from this , judging the model s success is really only dependent on the choice of the underlying multi distribution .",
    "three simple @xmath0  multiplicity - like distributions are used for the multi component , for comparison .",
    "the @xmath0  collisions at @xmath6=200gev minimum bias distribution is used ( closed circles ) which is similar to the `` wounded nucleon model ''  @xcite approach and yields a multiplicity which is @xmath1930% lower than the measured au+au data .",
    "rejecting the single diffractive events yields a higher multiplicity ( open circles ) but is still significantly lower than the au+au distributions .",
    "a more radical approach is to only choose the highest multiplicity @xmath0  events , in this case more than the average ( @xmath2624 ) ( squares ) , which does achieve the desired multiplicity .",
    "one can understand this approach in terms of the origins of the model  as higher multiplicity events typically have lower energy leading hadrons , thus releasing more energy to particle production .",
    "changing the reference @xmath0  multiplicity is not the only way to alter the resultant multiplicity distribution . also shown",
    "are a subset of events from the minimum bias @xmath0  cross - section which exclusively selects out gluon interactions ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) with a large momentum transfer ( @xmath29gev/@xmath20 ) ( lines ) .",
    "( note that the same multiplicity enhancement is also found by using all ( quark and gluon ) interactions with @xmath30gev/@xmath20 . )",
    "such an approach may represent the close - packedness of the nucleons which may facilitate a large momentum transfer .",
    "the different minimum @xmath13 values used as the multi component ( denoted as dotted and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplicityi ] ) show the sensitivity of the choice of @xmath13 in the final distribution ( @xmath31 of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : multiplicity ] ) ; for multiplicity this is small .    rather than assuming a given @xmath9  and/or @xmath10  multiplicity distribution , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : monomulti ] can be used to extract these two underlying distributions from the data .",
    "two bins in centrality ( preferably far apart in centrality ) are used to simultaneously extract @xmath9  and @xmath10 .",
    "this is referred to as the pair fit method . after finding the underlying distributions ,",
    "these are fixed and all centrality bins are recombined using the @xmath4  and @xmath5  as in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : monomulti ] . to test the sensitivity to the bins chosen ,",
    "several combinations are made .",
    "the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplicityii ] show the phobos data ( grey bands ) with the fit distributions ( solid lines ) .",
    "panels ( a , b ) , ( c , d ) , ( e , f ) , ( g , h ) in fig .  [ fig : multiplicityii ] , show data for au+au collisions at 200  @xcite , 130  @xcite , 62.4  @xcite , and 19.6gev  @xcite respectively . in each case",
    ", the model uses the most central 0 - 6% and 35 - 45% ( mid - central ) data to extract the underlying mono and multi distributions .",
    "using other bin combinations does not significantly alter the resultant distributions .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplicityii ] shows the underlying @xmath9  ( dashed line ) and @xmath10  ( solid line ) distributions from the fit .",
    "the grey and open bands represent the systematic error of the data . for comparison , the gluon - only distribution selected from pythia  ( dot - dashed lines for the @xmath30gev/@xmath20 distribution only at 200gev ) along with the minimum bias at the same center - of - mass energy ( circles )",
    "are also shown .",
    "the underlying multi distribution is considered `` stable '' in the sense that using different centrality pairs does not change appreciably the extracted @xmath10  distribution .",
    "mono , however , is less stable when using the pair fit method and is found to be more dependent on the choice of centrality bin .",
    "several interesting artifacts of the fit are observed .",
    "first , the extracted @xmath10  distribution is close to that which would be obtained by using a gluon - only @xmath0  distribution in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : multiplicity ] , but with more yield at mid - rapidity and also narrower .",
    "second , the mono distribution is considerably lower at mid - rapidity than the measured minimum bias @xmath0  collisions  @xcite , as shown by the comparison of the mono - collisions from the pair fit to minimum bias @xmath0  in fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplicityii ] , panels ( b ) , ( f ) , and ( h ) .",
    "this is possibly hinting that a modification exists , due to an opaque multi region .",
    "a more detailed description of this modification is discussed in the next section .",
    "the final notable observation is that the yield of the extracted mono interactions is higher at forward rapidities , as compared to the minimum bias @xmath0 .",
    "this could possibly point to an influence of spectators in the measured data .",
    "to reiterate , @xmath10  represents the multiplicity per participant pair of the multi region , which is consistent with the expected yield from a gluon - dominated collisional center .",
    "the core is found to be opaque , with some of the multiplicity from the surrounding mono collisions absorbed .",
    "importantly , even though the size of the central multi region changes , the yield per participant does not change .                             [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in summary , we have shown that some aspects of heavy ion data can be reproduced using a simple two - component model , with participant - like scaling variables . as an initial test of the model ,",
    "we find that the multiplicity and unidentified charged hadron spectra can be reproduced with an underlying gluon - dominated distribution ; the latter without the need for a large suppression at high-@xmath1 . by fitting the data",
    ", we can simultaneously extract underlying distributions for each sub - component of the collision : the singly - hit mono participants and the multiply - hit multi . from this , a suppression is observed , however , it is limited to particles originating at surface - collisions ( mono ) and mostly in the low- to intermediate-@xmath1  region .",
    "the component characterizing the multiple nucleon - nucleon interactions is found to be peaked in the intermediate @xmath1  region and becomes flat at the highest measured @xmath1 . with these two sub - components ,",
    "we observe that there is a mechanism by which one can reliably reproduce the multiplicity , spectral shapes , and freeze - out parameters .",
    "these is no need for a large ( up to a factor of five ) suppression which is currently used to describe the heavy ion data using the @xmath16  variable . at the center of this model picture",
    "is a dense ( perhaps gluon dominated ) system ( multi ) which is opaque to the particles produced at the periphery of the collision ( mono ) . a gluon - dominated picture is not excluded by other measurements , as discussed",
    ", the anomalous increase of baryons , with respect to mesons , could be expected from a system with a higher number of gluon - jets than quark - jets , though more details are outside the scope of the current paper .    to conclude , in our model , we assert that the yield of high-@xmath1  particles is not suppressed . the apparent reduction in yields observed at high-@xmath1",
    "is in fact due to a different particle production mechanism than what is expected from minimum bias @xmath0  interactions .",
    "in particular this mechanism does not produce high-@xmath1  particles at the expected binary collision rate , but rather at a slower rate as determined by the geometry of the collision , in a similar way to that expected from close - packed gluons .",
