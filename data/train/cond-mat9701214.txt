    "the magnetic properties of low dimensional systems have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental research in recent years .",
    "it is by now well established that one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets with integer spin have a gap in the excitation spectrum , whereas those with half - integer spin have gapless excitations .",
    "the former have a finite correlation length , while for the latter it is infinite with the spin - spin correlation function decaying to zero as a power law . in 2-dimensions ,",
    "the unfrustrated square - lattice heisenberg model has long range nel order in the ground state .",
    "it has gapless goldstone modes as expected . in recent years",
    "much interest has focussed on systems with intermediate dimensionality and on questions of crossovers between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the investigations showed that the crossover from the single heisenberg chain to the two - dimensional antiferromagnet square lattice , obtained by assembling chains to form a `` ladder '' of increasing width , is far from smooth .",
    "heisenberg ladders with an even number of legs ( chain ) show a completely different behavior than odd - leg - ladders .",
    "while even - leg - ladders have a spin gap and short range correlation , odd - leg - ladders have no gap and power - law correlations .",
    "this paper is concerned with a system between 2 and 3 dimensions : the @xmath0 two - layer heisenberg antiferromagnet , where each layer is composed of a nearest - neighbor heisenberg model on a square lattice , and there is a further antiferromagnetic coupling between corresponding sites of each layer .",
    "the system can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a s=1/2 spin operator at site @xmath11 of the @xmath12th layer , and @xmath13 denotes a pair of nearest neighbor sites on a square lattice . here",
    "@xmath14 is the interaction between nearest neighbor spins in one plane , and @xmath15 is the interaction between adjacent spins from different layers .",
    "we denote the ratio of couplings as @xmath16 , that is , @xmath17 . in the present paper ,",
    "we study only the case of antiferromagnetic coupling , that is , both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are positive , although some of the series are applicable to ferromagnetic coupling case . in the small @xmath18 limit ,",
    "the model describes two weakly interacting 2d heisenberg antiferromagnets , where each of them is nel ordered and possesses gapless goldstone excitations . in the large @xmath18 limit , pairs of adjacent spins from different layers form spin singlets separated from triplet states by a gap , @xmath19 , and the system has no long - range order .",
    "thus one expects there is a transition from ordered antiferromagnet to a quantum disordered spin liquid at a certain critical ratio of @xmath18 .",
    "the bilayer heisenberg antiferromagnets has recently attracted attention for several reasons . on the experimental side ,",
    "the model is relevant to the understanding of the magnetic properties of cuprate superconductors yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath20 containing two weakly coupled cuo@xmath4 layers@xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "it is probably the simplest unfrustrated spin system which displays a quantum disordering transition of @xmath21 universality class , and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation on this model do not suffer from a sign problem , making it possible to obtain precise data on the critical properties of the quantum transition .",
    "hida@xcite has performed a dimer expansion up to 6th order in @xmath22 , and he found the critical ratio to be @xmath23 , gelfand@xcite has recently extended the dimer expansion to 8th order , and obtains the critical ratio @xmath24 .",
    "et al._@xcite have carried out a detailed qmc simulations for the finite - temperature properties of small @xmath25 and near - critical @xmath26 systems , and found a similar critical ratio : @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "a schwinger boson mean - field calculation by millis and monien@xcite resulted in a very large critical ratio : @xmath28 ; a self - consistent spin - wave theory@xcite also predicts a large critical ratio : @xmath29 .",
    "chubukov and morr@xcite have argued that the discrepancies between the spin - wave results and the numerical simulations ( or series expansions ) have a physical origin and are related to the fact that in the spin - wave approach one neglects longitudinal spin fluctuations , and after taking longitudinal spin fluctuations into account , they got the critical ratio : @xmath30 , which is reasonably close to the numerical results .",
    "the critical ratio obtained by the schwinger - boson gutzwiller - projection method@xcite is @xmath31 .",
    "we have carried out extensive series studies of this system , via ising expansions and dimer expansions at @xmath1 , and also by high temperature series expansions .",
    "our results confirm the existence of a order - disorder transition at critical coupling ratio @xmath32 .",
    "the complete spin - wave excitation spectra , spin - wave velocity , and some order parameters are computed .",
    "we also compare our results with previous calculations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the dimer expansions are presented , and the antiferromagnetic order - disorder transition points is determined precisely . in sec .",
    "iii , the heisenberg - ising model is studied via the ising expansions , which allow for estimates of the domain stability of nel - order phase , and also allow a direct comparison with experimental data of yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath20 . in sec .",
    "iv we present the results of the high - temperature expansions , and our conclusion is presented in the last section .",
    "in the limit that the exchange coupling along the rungs @xmath15 is much larger than the coupling @xmath14 within the plane , that is @xmath33 , the rungs interact only weakly with each other , and the dominant configuration in the ground state is the product state with the spin on each rung forming a spin singlet .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath34 where @xmath35 we can construct expansion in @xmath36 by treating the operator @xmath37 as the unperturbed hamiltonian and the operator @xmath38 is treated as a perturbation . the linked - cluster expansion method has been previously reviewed in several articles@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "we have carried out the dimer expansions for the @xmath1 ground state energy per site @xmath39 , the antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath40 , and the lowest lying triplet excitation spectrum @xmath41 ( odd parity under interchange of the planes ) up to order @xmath42 .",
    "the resulting power series in @xmath36 for the ground state energy per site @xmath39 and the antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath40 are presented in table i. table of series coefficients for the triplet excitation spectrum @xmath41 would require inordinate amount of space to reproduce in print , it is available from the authors on request . instead , we also present in table i the series for the minimum energy gap @xmath43 .",
    "the dimer expansion was firstly carried out by hida@xcite up to order @xmath44 in 1992 , and extended to order @xmath45 by gelfand@xcite recently .",
    "our results agree with these previous results , and extend the series by three terms .",
    "a list of 19093 linked clusters of up to 12 sites contribute to the triplet excitation spectrum .",
    "to determine the critical point @xmath46 , we construct the dlog pad approximants@xcite to the @xmath40 and @xmath47 series , and since the transition should lie in the universality class of the classical @xmath48 heisenberg model ( our analysis also supports this ) , we expect that the critical index for @xmath40 and @xmath47 should be approximately 1.40 and 0.71 , respectively .",
    "the exponent - biased dlog pad approximants@xcite gives the critical point @xmath49 , or @xmath50 .",
    "the spectra for some particular values of @xmath22 are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , where the direct sum to the series at @xmath51 is indeed consistent with the pad approximants that one can construct . to compute the critical spin - wave velocity @xmath52 , one expands the spectrum @xmath53 in the vicinity of wave - vector @xmath54 up to @xmath55 : @xmath56 = c(1/y ) + d(1/y ) ( k_x^2 + k_y^2 ) + \\cdots \\label{eqv}\\ ] ] and it is easy to prove@xcite that the critical spin - wave velocity is equal to @xmath57 at @xmath46 .",
    "the series coefficients for @xmath58 in @xmath22 are listed in table i. using pad approximants , one can estimate the properties at critical point @xmath46 : the spin - wave velocity is estimated to be @xmath59 , or @xmath60 , the ground - state energy per site is @xmath61 , the optical spin - wave gap ( the gap at @xmath62 ) is @xmath63 , and the gap at @xmath64 is @xmath65 , where the uncertainly is largely associated with the uncertainly in @xmath46 .",
    "to construct an expansion about the ising limit for this system , one has to introduce an anisotropy parameter @xmath66 , and writes the hamiltonian for heisenberg - ising model as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 on the two sublattices .",
    "the last term in both @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a local staggered field term , which can be included to improve convergence . the limits @xmath70 and @xmath71 correspond to the ising model and the isotropic heisenberg model respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath37 is taken as the unperturbed hamiltonian , with the unperturbed ground state being the usual nel state .",
    "the operator @xmath38 is treated as a perturbation .",
    "it flips a pair of spins on neighbouring sites .",
    "the ising series have been calculated for the ground state energy per site @xmath39 , the staggered magnetization @xmath72 , the uniform perpendicular susceptibility @xmath73 , and the lowest lying triplet excitation spectrum @xmath74 for several ratio of couplings and ( simultaneously ) for several values of @xmath75 up to order @xmath76 ( the series for uniform perpendicular susceptibility @xmath73 is one order less ) .",
    "the resulting series for @xmath77 and @xmath78 are listed in tables ii and iii ( the series coefficients for triplet excitation spectrum are listed only for case of @xmath79 ) , the series for other value of @xmath16 are available on request .",
    "we can also compute the spin - wave velocity @xmath52 through a similar expansion of @xmath80 in the vicinity of @xmath81 as in eq.([eqv ] ) , and the series coefficients for @xmath58 in @xmath66 are also listed in table ii . with this series and the series for the perpendicular susceptibility @xmath73 , one can get the series for the spin - wave stiffness @xmath82 through the following `` hydrodynamic '' relation : @xmath83    there are two branches of the spin - wave dispersion . from the series",
    "one can see that the symmetric ( optical ) excitation spectrum @xmath84 ( that is , with even parity under interchange of the planes ) is related to the antisymmetric ( acoustic ) excitation spectrum @xmath85 ( that is , with odd parity under interchange of the planes ) by @xmath86 so we only consider the antisymmetric excitation spectrum here .",
    "the conventional linear spin - wave theory@xcite predicts the magnon dispersions as : @xmath87^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "therefore one can see that the acoustic spin - wave gap @xmath89 is zero even for nonzero @xmath15 , the optical gap is @xmath90 which is non - zero as long as @xmath91 , and the gap at @xmath92 is @xmath93    in a recent paper , millis and monien@xcite got the following relation for the optical spin - wave gap by using the schwinger boson method : @xmath94 and so at the limit of @xmath95 , one results that @xmath96 , which differs from eq.([eqopt ] ) by a factor of @xmath97 , where @xmath98 .    having obtained the series we first attempt to identify critical points and to determine the nature of the phase diagram in the @xmath99 plane .",
    "naive dlog pad analysis reveals lines of singularities , as shown in fig .",
    "these are obtained consistently for the staggered magnetization @xmath72 and the uniform perpendicular susceptibility @xmath40 .",
    "we note , in particular , that for the critical point @xmath100 is about equal to 1 at @xmath101 , this is consistent with the critical point determined by the dimer expansions .    at the next stage of the analysis",
    ", we try to extrapolate the series to the isotropic point ( @xmath71 ) for those values of the exchange coupling parameters which lie within the nel - ordered phase at @xmath71 . for this purpose",
    ", we first transform the series to a new variable @xmath102 to remove the singularity at @xmath71 predicted by the spin - wave theory .",
    "this was first proposed by huse@xcite and was also used in our earlier work on the square lattice case@xcite .",
    "we then use both the integrated first - order inhomogeneous differential approximants@xcite and the naive pad approximants to extrapolate the series to the isotropic point @xmath103 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the results for the ground state energy per site @xmath39 , the staggered magnetization @xmath72 , the uniform perpendicular susceptibility @xmath73 , and spin - wave velocity @xmath52 , and the spin - wave stiffness @xmath82 are shown in figs .",
    "the results for @xmath104 presented in the figures are taken from our earlier work on the single - layer square lattice@xcite .",
    "the estimates of the ground state energy per site @xmath39 from dimer expansions is also shown in fig .",
    "3 . note that in the classical spin - wave ( large @xmath105 ) level , the uniform perpendicular susceptibility @xmath73 , the spin - wave velocity @xmath52 , and spin - wave stiffness @xmath82 are found to be : @xmath106 so in order to remove the trivial dependent of these quantities on @xmath16 , figs .",
    "4 - 5 have been presented in terms of quantum renormalizations of the classical spin - wave values .",
    "we note that @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath82 first increase for small @xmath18 , pass through a maximum at about @xmath107 , and then decrease for larger value of @xmath18 , and vanishes at about @xmath101 , which is consistent with the critical point determined by the dimer expansion .",
    "the reason that in the case of small @xmath18 , the interlayer coupling enhances the antiferromagnetic long - range order is the system acquires a weak three dimensionality and quantum fluctuation is suppressed .    the antisymmetric excitation spectra @xmath85 for some particular values of @xmath16 are illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , where we can see that the excitation is gapless at @xmath108 point . in fig . 7 , we present a plot of energy gaps at @xmath109 and @xmath110 obtained from the linear spin - wave expansion , the schwinger boson method@xcite , the dimer expansions , and the ising expansions .",
    "we can see , from figs .",
    "6 - 7 , that the spin - wave gap evolves very smoothly from the ordered side to the disordered side of the transition , ( the gap at @xmath111 turns out to have a small discontinuity at transition point , which may be due to the estimates from ising expansions being a little too small ) . from fig . 7 , we can also see that for @xmath112 , the results of leading order spin - wave theory is about 10% smaller than our estimates from ising expansions . for optical magnon gap @xmath113 ,",
    "the schwinger boson method give consistent results with those estimated from the ising expansions over the region @xmath114 , but as @xmath16 decreases from 0.2 , the optical magnon gap estimated by the ising expansions becomes larger than that predicted by the spin - wave theory , and also by the schwinger boson method .",
    "finally , let us estimate the interlayer exchange constant for yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 using the optical magnon gap estimated by ising expansions : the recent neutron scattering measurements@xcite have report that the optical magnon gap for yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 is @xmath115mev , and if we take the canonical value of @xmath116mev , we estimate that @xmath117 , whereas @xmath18 estimated by the spin - wave theory@xcite and by the schwinger boson theory@xcite are @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "we now turn to the thermodynamic properties of the system at finite temperatures .",
    "we have developed high - temperature series expansions for the uniform magnetic susceptibility @xmath120 and the specific heat @xmath121 , for the system with arbitrary @xmath22 , @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the number of sites , and @xmath124 , and the internal energy @xmath125 is defined by @xmath126 the series were computed to order @xmath127 for @xmath128 and to order @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "these series are listed in table iv .",
    "we use the integrated first - order inhomogeneous differential approximants@xcite and the naive pad approximants to extrapolate the series .",
    "the resulting estimates for some particular values of @xmath22 are shown in figs .",
    "8 - 9 . for the susceptibility",
    ", in order to remove the trivial dependence of @xmath128 on curie - weiss temperature , we present in fig . 8 the @xmath131 as a function of @xmath132 where the curie - weiss temperature @xmath133 . from this graph , we can see that for @xmath134 , the susceptibility @xmath120 converge nicely to very low temperature , and vanishes in the low temperature limit , which consistent with a gapped system . for @xmath135 , the extrapolation , as judged by the consistency of different approximants , do not converge well in low - temperature region . at the critical ratio @xmath26 , monte carlo simulations@xcite have shown that the universal , linear behavior of @xmath128 extends up to very high temperature @xmath136 , unfortunately our series extrapolation is not reliable enough to see this behavior .",
    "in the preceding sections we have presented and analyzed a variety of high - order perturbation series expansions for the two - layer , @xmath0 , square lattice heisenberg ( and heisenberg - ising ) model . at @xmath1 , we have added three more terms to existing series for the ground state energy @xmath39 , the antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath40 , and the lowest lying triplet excitation spectrum @xmath41 from the expansions about the interlayer dimer limits , and also carried out new perturbation series expansions about the ising limit up to tenth order for a number of properties .",
    "in addition , high - temperature series for the system with arbitrary @xmath22 are computed to order @xmath127 for uniform magnetic susceptibility @xmath128 and to order @xmath129 for the specific heat @xmath130 .",
    "based on exponent - biased analyses of the high - order dimer expansions for triplet energy gap and antiferromagnetic susceptibility , we estimate the antiferromagnetic order - disorder transition occurring at @xmath1 at a critical coupling ratio @xmath137 , which is in good agreement with the quantum monte carlo results@xcite @xmath138 . the spin - wave velocity at the critical point is estimated to be @xmath139 , ( equivalently , @xmath140 ) , which is slightly higher than the qmc results@xcite @xmath141 .",
    "the spin - triplet excitation spectra for the system on both ordered and disordered phases are computed , and they seem to be evolve smoothly from the ordered side to the disordered side of the transition . at the limit of @xmath142 , the optical magnon gap obtained by the ising expansions is larger than @xmath143 , instead of less than @xmath143 as predicted by the schwinger boson method , and this implies the interlayer exchange constant is @xmath144 for yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6",
