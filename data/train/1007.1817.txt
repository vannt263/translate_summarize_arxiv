    "recent technical progress in generating microbubbles ( e.g. @xcite ) , including potentials as actuator and sensor , has enhanced the range of applications , e.g. additives to reduce a turbulence friction ( @xcite ) , drug delivery capsules ( @xcite ) , and contrast agents ( @xcite ) . in many situations ,",
    "a bubble encounters a boundary wall during its transport process , and a hydrodynamic interaction occurs as characterized by the inter - scale between the bubble and the wall . in practice",
    ", it is of primary importance that the bubble undergoes a repulsive or attractive force in the wall - normal direction , which causes a lateral migration ( @xcite ) and determines the bubble distribution , when translating parallel to the wall . as the simplest model system",
    ", one may raise a phenomenon of a spherical bubble rising near a vertical infinite plane wall in a creeping ( stokes ) flow .",
    "however , there is no mechanism to generate the lateral migration force , as kinematic reversibility is ensured by symmetry of the boundary and by linearity in the stokes equation ( @xcite , chapter 4 ) .",
    "in fact , the migration force stems from nonlinearities in the advective momentum transport ( @xcite ) and/or the interfacial deformability ( @xcite ) , to break the symmetry .    for a tank - treading vesicle translating parallel to the wall ,",
    "the migration force was theoretically obtained by @xcite , in which the vesicle shape is prescribed as a strongly non - spherical ellipsoid , and the theory was experimentally validated by @xcite . for a bubble or drop ,",
    "the shape can not be prescribed since it obeys the laplace law and depends on the surrounding fluid flow .",
    "the theoretical success in solving the nontrivial problem of the deformation - induced migration of the bubble or drop was made by @xcite using the faxn mirror image technique and the lorentz reciprocal theorem .",
    "however , @xcite performed a numerical study on the motion of a drop with the same viscosity as the surrounding fluid in a linear shear flow by means of a boundary element method , and pointed out that the theory considerably underestimates the migration velocity or erroneously predicts the lateral motion , despite consistent predictions of the rising velocity and the interfacial deformation .",
    "recently , @xcite experimentally measured the lateral migration velocity of slightly deformed bubbles in a wall - bounded shear flow , and found a clear discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values of the deformation - induced transverse force .",
    "then , they computed the quasi - steady evolution of deformable bubbles moving in a wall - bounded linear shear flow at zero reynolds number using a spectral boundary element method developed by @xcite , and found that the measured deformation - induced lift force agrees quantitatively well with the computational prediction",
    ". motivated by their conclusions , we revisited experimental data of the bubble migration in a quiescent liquid obtained by @xcite , and analysed the data on the conditions that the clearance between the bubble interface and the wall is comparable to or shorter than the bubble radius , which was not considered there .",
    "the results revealed that the discrepancy between the migration velocities of the experiment and the theory increased as the bubble was closed to the wall , as detailed below .    in this paper , we focus on the bubble motion in a quiescent liquid to simplify the subject .",
    "let us consider the migration velocity @xmath10 of a bubble rising near a vertical plane wall at a distance @xmath11 between the bubble centroid and the wall as schematically illustrated in figure [ fig : schem](a ) .",
    "the bubble has an equivalent radius @xmath2 to that of a sphere with the same volume . introducing an interfacial deflection @xmath12 from a sphere , we write the distance from the bubble centroid to the interface as @xmath13 . the experimental results used here",
    "were measured under the condition that the reynolds number @xmath14 ( here @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 , and @xmath8 respectively denote the rising velocity , the density , and the dynamic viscosity of liquid ) is unity or less ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pure lateral migration velocities induced by the deformation @xmath17 were calculated from the measured values substituting the velocities induced by the inertia effects . following a stokes flow theory for the deformation - induced migration ( @xcite ) , we can characterize the system using two parameters , i.e. , a clearance parameter @xmath3 and a capillary number @xmath18 ( or a bond number @xmath19 as used in @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath20 respectively denote the surface tension and the acceleration of gravity .",
    "further , as long as @xmath21 , we may use @xmath22 as a perturbation parameter , and reduce the @xmath22-dependent system to another , in which @xmath7 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are dependent only upon @xmath4 , under the infinitesimal deformation assumption .",
    "figure [ fig : migvel_comp_exp ] shows the migration velocity @xmath17 away from the wall normalized by @xmath25 as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "( it should be noticed that although @xmath27 as well as @xmath4 are measures of the distance between the wall and the bubble , hereafter @xmath27 is also used to make some equations for the wide gap case ( @xmath28 ) simple . )",
    "the measured velocity is found to be much higher than the analytical solution especially for the large @xmath27 .",
    "a possible inference drawn from this result is that there exists an additional ingredient to generate repulsive force for narrow bubble - wall gap , which is not covered by the theory of @xcite .",
    "as the most crucial restriction involved in the mirror image technique , we can raise an assumption that the bubble - wall distance is much longer than the bubble radius .",
    "however , with regard to an inertia effect on the lateral velocity of a rigid sphere , @xcite experimentally demonstrated that the mirror image approach has robust applicability in prediction beyond the wide - gap precondition . at this moment , we can not conclude whether the discrepancy in the deformation - induced migration velocity comes from the erroneous prediction due to the miscalculation or the contradictory conditions in the boundary element computation and the experiment with the theoretical assumptions . to complement the experiment and to gain further insight into the deformation - induced migration , we investigate the migration behavior with attention to shortness of a bubble - wall clearance @xmath29 . as in @xcite , using two stokes flow solutions for a spherical bubble translating parallel and perpendicular to the wall",
    ", we apply the lorentz reciprocal theorem to evaluating the migration velocity .",
    "we carry out numerical simulations using a boundary - fitted grid , which can accurately implement the boundary conditions and release the constraint of the sufficiently wide bubble - wall gap in the mirror image technique .",
    "in addition , comparisons with a theoretical migration velocity for @xmath30 obtained from a lubrication study of a nearly spherical drop moving near a tilted plane ( @xcite ) , in which the secondary flow due to the change in the boundary geometry caused by the bubble deformation is responsible for the wall - normal force , are made to shed more light on the short clearance effect .",
    "to clarify the physical mechanism of the repulsive force , we numerically address the bubble migration . in a similar manner to @xcite , instead of directly solving the flow field with the deformed bubble",
    ", we employ the lorentz reciprocal theorem to determine the lateral migration force and velocity through coupling two flow fields around a spherical bubble translating parallel and perpendicular to the wall . in the subsequent developments ,",
    "the basic equations and the involved variables are nondimensionalized using @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we suppose that the bubble quasi - steadily rises near an infinite flat plate in a stagnant incompressible liquid , and both the reynolds and capillary numbers are sufficiently smaller than unity .",
    "hence , the system is described by the steady stokes equation for solenoidal velocity vectors , i.e. @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the velocity and stress fields for the bubble translating respectively parallel and perpendicular at a speed of unity to the wall .",
    "the @xmath22 dependence of the interfacial deflection is given by @xmath35 .",
    "the bubble deformation obeys the laplace law for the infinitesimal deflection @xmath36 with @xmath21 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the normal unit vector pointing outwards the liquid , @xmath39 is the nabla operator along the tangential directions on the bubble surface , @xmath40 is the area average taken over the bubble surface , and @xmath41 is the coordinates in the upward direction from the origin at the bubble centroid .",
    "kinematic and free - slip conditions are imposed on the bubble surface , i.e. @xmath42 where we take the reference frames viewed from the bubble . on the plane wall",
    ", we impose the no - slip condition @xmath43 sufficiently far from the bubble , the velocity vectors approach the uniform velocities @xmath44 thanks to the reciprocal theorem ( @xcite ; ( 35 ) of @xcite ) , the deformation - induced lateral force @xmath45 to cancel the migration velocity and to maintain the wall - parallel motion is expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the bubble surface , and the operator @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 the migration velocity @xmath50 is expressed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the drag force acting on the bubble translating perpendicular to the plane wall .",
    "the basic equations are numerically solved by the second - order finite - difference method discretized on the bipolar coordinates @xmath53 grid , which is boundary - fitted on both the bubble surface and the plane wall ( see figure [ fig : schem_bipolar](a ) in appendix [ appendix_a ] ) .",
    "we take care of the mass and momentum conservations in a discretized form . for technical detail on the discretization , see appendix [ appendix_a ] .",
    "the number of grid points is @xmath54 , and the grid is non - uniform and refined near the wall and the bubble surface . the computational procedure is based on a simplified - marker - and - cell method ( @xcite ) with a first - order eulerian implicit time marching scheme .",
    "such an unsteady scheme enables us to check whether the computation converges to the fully developed state through temporal changes in the budgets of the momentum and kinetic - energy transports . to avoid a problem associated with singularities in the discretization near the axis ,",
    "we follow a method proposed by @xcite .    for each run",
    ", we confirm that drag forces , numerically evaluated on the bubble surface , for both the perpendicular and parallel motions are in good agreement with the respective kinetic - energy dissipation rates , numerically integrated over the entire computational domain , normalized by the translational velocities with an error of less than @xmath55 .",
    "such an agreement between the surface and bulk quantities indicates that the computation is well converged and reaches to the steady state in view of the momentum and kinetic - energy budgets .",
    "further , the drag force for the perpendicular motion shows quantitative agreement with the infinite series solution of @xcite with an error of less than @xmath56 .",
    "the drag force for the parallel motion approaches the wide - gap solution of @xcite with increasing @xmath4 . to make sure of numerical stability and accuracy , we set the clearance parameter in a range of @xmath57 .",
    "we performed the convergence tests with varying the size @xmath58 of the computational domain , the number @xmath59 of nodes in the gap between the bubble and the wall , and the number @xmath60 of nodes describing the bubble surface .",
    "we confirmed that the relative errors in the migration velocity @xmath17 and the drag forces for the perpendicular and parallel bubble motions to those obtained on the base meshes @xmath54 for various @xmath4 decrease with increasing the size @xmath58 and the resolutions @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "from the convergence behaviors , we deduce to obtain the migration velocities @xmath17 with errors of much less than @xmath61 using the present base meshes , which are accurate enough for the subsequent discussion .",
    "as shown in the inset of figure [ fig : migvel_comp_exp ] , the ratio of the simulation to the analytical migration velocity becomes close to unity as @xmath62 approaches zero , indicating the simulation result is consistent with the analytical solution ( @xcite ) for small @xmath63 .",
    "such a consistency between the different approaches may deny the erroneous prediction of the migration velocity in @xcite , of which the possibility was pointed out by @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the simulated migration velocity for the bubble closer to the wall with the clearance shorter than the bubble radius ( i.e. , for @xmath64 presumably beyond the theoretical precondition @xmath28 ) is considerably higher than the analytical solution .",
    "although the simulation result reveals lower velocity than the experimental one , the tendency of the higher velocity than the theoretical one for the narrow gap is qualitatively similar to that in the experiment .",
    "thus , the present simulation also indicates the presence of the additional narrow - gap repulsive force .    for an undeformed spherical bubble at small but non - zero reynolds numbers",
    "@xmath65 , using the solutions to the equation set ( [ eq : cont_st])([eq : far_st ] ) , we can also evaluate the inertia effect on the migration velocity @xmath66 from @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 stands for the entire volume of liquid around the bubble . the force expression ( [ eq : fmre_st ] ) is theoretically justified for the case that the wall is placed within a stokes expansion region , i.e. , @xmath70 ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : migvel_inert ] shows the inertia - driven migration velocity as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "the simulated profile is globally consistent with the analytical solution ( @xcite ) even for the narrow gap @xmath71 , as opposed to the profile of the deformation - induced migration velocity in figure [ fig : migvel_comp_exp ] .",
    "it should be noticed that the expression ( [ eq : fmca_st ] ) of the deformation - induced lateral force is written in a surface integral form , while the inertia - driven force ( [ eq : fmre_st ] ) in a volume integral form .",
    "the overall agreement in the inertia - driven migration velocity indicates that capturing the bulk velocity distributions is important for predicting the migration velocity and can be robustly attained by the mirror image technique over the wide range of @xmath27 .",
    "the wide range agreement with the theories ( @xcite ) was also experimentally demonstrated for the sedimenting rigid particle in a range of @xmath72 by @xcite as long as the wall is placed in the stokes expansion region .",
    "contrastingly , as shown in figure [ fig : migvel_comp_exp ] , the larger discrepancy between the deformation - induced migration velocities of the simulation and the theory with increasing @xmath27 indicates that the migration velocity is sensitive to the local effect leading to the additional narrow - gap repulsive force , which may not be covered by the mirror image technique .      to demonstrate the narrow - gap effect",
    ", we investigate the bubble deformation .",
    "we here examine the scaled interfacial deflection @xmath73 . in the experiment , we estimated @xmath12 taking a circumference of the bubble on the plane @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ fig : scale_deform ] shows the angular profile of the deflection @xmath75 for various @xmath62 . as shown in figure [ fig : scale_deform](a ) for the relatively wide gap @xmath76 , the analytical solution for @xmath28 ( @xcite ) is consistent with the measured and simulated deflections .",
    "note that the agreement between the theoretical and simulated deflections is confirmed to be better in the wider separation .",
    "for the narrower gap ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) , by contrast , the analytical solution of the deflection magnitude is smaller than the measured one especially in the wall neighborhood ( @xmath79 ) , which may be related to the considerable underestimation of the migration velocity as shown in figure [ fig : migvel_comp_exp ] .",
    "contrastingly , the present simulation quantitatively captures the local near - wall profile of the measured deflection as well as the global magnitude .    to quantify the local effect of such a large discrepancy in @xmath80 on the migration velocity",
    ", we here describe the deflection in an expansion form @xmath81 where @xmath82 represents the associated legendre polynomial .",
    "figure [ fig : deformationr_kap ] shows the modal deflections @xmath83 for @xmath84 as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "the simulation results are consistent with the measured deflections for all the shown modes . in predicting the bubble migration , the wide - gap theory ( @xcite )",
    "assumes that the mirror image primarily induces the deformation of the mode @xmath85 .",
    "the leading - order of the @xmath85 deflection is @xmath86 in the limit of @xmath87 .",
    "considering the higher - order effect with respect to @xmath27 , @xcite derived @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 .",
    "for @xmath92 , such a higher - order @xmath27 correction is responsible for the enhancement of the @xmath85 deflection from the leading - order one as seen in the better agreement with the measured and simulated deflections .",
    "however , the correction is not sufficient for the narrower gap @xmath93 , and thus the theoretical underestimation of the @xmath85 deflection becomes more serious with @xmath27 .",
    "further , the theory does not cover the considerable increase in the higher - order @xmath94 deflections with @xmath27 as demonstrated by both the measurement and the simulation .",
    "the modal deflection @xmath83 is linked to the migration velocity and force as decomposed into @xmath95 which are @xmath96 @xmath97    figure [ fig : modal](a ) shows the contribution of the modal deflection to the migration velocity for the modes @xmath85 and @xmath98 . for small @xmath27 ,",
    "the simulation result is consistent with the analytical solution ( @xcite ) , which considers only the @xmath85 deformation to cause the bubble migration .",
    "the inset shows that for small @xmath27 , the contribution of the mode @xmath85 is proportional to @xmath99 , while that of the mode @xmath98 to @xmath100 , whose exponent is not trivially proven but may be predictable extending the regular perturbation to the higher - order .",
    "the difference in the exponent ensures that the relative contribution of the mode @xmath98 to @xmath85 becomes more significant with @xmath27 .",
    "it should be noticed that although we confirmed that the migration force contribution @xmath101 of the mode @xmath85 increases as @xmath102 ( i.e. , @xmath103 ) , the velocity contribution @xmath104 reduces as shown in figure [ fig : modal](a ) .",
    "it is because the slope of the @xmath85 migration force , @xmath105 , in a logarithmic plot is more gentle than that of the drag force , @xmath106 in the denominator of ( [ eq : vb3nca_fm ] ) as @xmath103 .",
    "figure [ fig : modal](b ) shows the modal contribution @xmath107 compared with the migration velocity @xmath108 .",
    "the contribution of the mode @xmath85 monotonically decreases with @xmath27 .",
    "the contribution of the mode @xmath98 increases with @xmath27 in the range of @xmath109 , while decreases in the greater @xmath27 .",
    "it is because the higher modal contributions for @xmath110 become no longer disregarded .",
    "moreover , the fact that all the shown modal contributions decay as @xmath102 indicates that the further higher - order contributions become considerable , and the regular perturbation approach with respect to @xmath27 is no longer effective .",
    "figures [ fig : scale_deform ] , [ fig : deformationr_kap ] and [ fig : modal ] imply that for small @xmath4 , the bubble deformation is preferentially enhanced within the narrow bubble - wall gap , and then its squeezing effect promotes the bubble migration . to shed more light on the role of the hydrodynamics in the gap , comparisons with a small deformation theory in the lubrication limit will be made .",
    "it should be noticed that @xcite have performed a lubrication study for a nearly spherical drop near a tilted plane in so - called ` slipping ' regime , and derived the deformation - induced normal force .",
    "one can also access a relevant physical picture in theoretical studies on the lift force on an elastic body induced by its deformation ( @xcite ) .",
    "following the spirit of the lubrication theory , we evaluate the migration velocity in the limit of @xmath103 .",
    "the basic equations for the lubrication analysis and the solutions are shown in appendix [ appendix_b ] . to be recalled and to be used for comparison with the simulation results , the preconditions and the perturbed quantities are detailed here .",
    "we prescribe the wall - parallel velocity @xmath7 , and employ standard lubrication assumption , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "we also suppose small capillary number @xmath21 . as implied in ( [ eq : def_f_lub ] ) ,",
    "the deflection is @xmath112 , which has to be sufficiently smaller than the gap @xmath113 if the tilt angle of the near - wall interface from the plane wall is supposed to be small .",
    "here we adopt an additional constraint @xmath114 .",
    "for inner coordinates @xmath115 ( here @xmath116 and @xmath117 as illustrated in figure [ fig : schem](b ) , ( see e.g. @xcite ) ) , a parabolic profile @xmath118 represents the interface within the inner region @xmath119 , if the deformation is absent . using @xmath4 , we write the velocity vector , the pressure , and the deflection @xmath120 of the interface in an expansion form with respect to @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123",
    "@xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 whose scaling relations are suitable to all equations in appendix [ appendix_b ] . it should be noted that the terms with the superscript @xmath127 , @xmath128 or @xmath129 in ( [ eq : ur_lub])([eq : p0_lub ] ) are proportional to @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 or @xmath133 , and thus provide no wall - normal force .",
    "here we make clear the physical domain of validity of the condition @xmath134 when the rising velocity @xmath7 , which is needed to evaluate @xmath135 , is unknown .",
    "following the analysis by @xcite , we write the drag force @xmath136 acting on the spherical bubble translating parallel to the wall in a form @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are independent of @xmath4 . considering the free - slip boundary condition on the bubble surface , we can analytically find @xmath140 . from our numerical data , we approximately estimate @xmath141 . hence , from the force balance @xmath142 , for @xmath30 , we evaluate the rising velocity @xmath143 and obtain the following relation for the bubble radius @xmath2 to satisfy the condition @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath144    to assure us of the appearance of the lubrication effect , figure [ fig : scale_pres ] shows the profiles of the pressure @xmath145 and deflection @xmath146 in the lubrication limit ( see ( [ eq : p_lub ] ) and ( [ eq : f_lub ] ) , respectively ) , which are compared with the simulation results of the scaled interfacial pressure @xmath147 and the scaled deflection @xmath148 near the wall as a function of @xmath149 . for sufficiently small @xmath4 , the simulation data of the scaled pressure collapse onto the curve ( [ eq : p_lub ] ) as shown in figure [ fig : scale_pres](a )",
    ". therefore , the scaled deflection profile reasonably approaches the lubrication solution ( [ eq : f_lub ] ) with decreasing the bubble - wall gap as shown in figure [ fig : scale_pres](b ) .",
    "as plotted as the dashed - dotted curve in figure [ fig : scale_deform ] , the deflection based on ( [ eq : def_f_lub ] ) and ( [ eq : f_lub ] ) is consistent with the measured and simulated deflections in the wall neighbour ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "hence , the discrepancy between the deflections of the narrow - gap experiment and the wide - gap theory ( @xcite ) is attributable to the lubrication effect .    from @xcite , the drag force acting on the bubble translating perpendicular to the plane wall",
    "is @xmath150 as @xmath103 . substituting this relation and ( [ eq : fm_lub ] ) ( i.e. , @xmath151 in the lubrication limit ) into ( [ eq : vb3ca ] )",

    "the inset of figure [ fig : migvel_comp_lub ] shows the scaled force ( [ eq : fm_lub ] ) .",
    "the simulation results are consistent with two asymptotic behaviors based on the lubrication theory for @xmath30 as well as the mirror image technique for @xmath153 ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) .",
    "as seen from figure [ fig : migvel_comp_lub ] , the theories provide the different exponents of the migration velocity scaling with respect to @xmath4 , namely , @xmath154 for @xmath155 and @xmath156 for @xmath30 .    the puzzling finding in @xcite that the theory of @xcite accurately predicts the deformation but fails to predict quantitatively the deformation - induced migration velocity is explained from the fact that the ratio of the simulation result of @xmath17 to the theoretical prediction is more sensitively dependent upon @xmath4 than that of @xmath157 when the lubrication effect becomes relevant . for instance , for @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 ,",

    "the lubrication effect is likely to compensate the large discrepancy between the migration velocities of the experiment and the wide - gap theory revealed in @xcite .",
    "however , although the quantitative agreement between the interfacial deflections of the experiment and the simulation is shown in figures [ fig : scale_deform ] and [ fig : deformationr_kap ] , the migration velocity in the experiment is still considerably higher than the simulated one .",
    "its cause is not clear at this moment , and further joint researches among theory , numerics and experiment are needed to resolve this discrepancy problem .",
    "we numerically and theoretically investigated deformation - induced lateral migration of a bubble slowly rising near a vertical plane wall in a stagnant liquid .",
    "we focused on a situation with a short clearance @xmath0 between the bubble interface and the wall .",
    "we demonstrated that the wide - gap theory ( @xcite ) , which considers the @xmath85 deformation mode , describes the deformation - induced lift force as long as the bubble - wall gap is sufficiently wide ( @xmath1 , here @xmath2 is the bubble radius ) .",
    "for the narrow - gap case with the clearance parameter @xmath3 smaller than unity , we found that the higher - order @xmath94 deformation modes crucially enhance the migration velocity , and the lubrication effect ( @xcite ) appears to induce the migration velocity , which scales asymptotically like @xmath167 as @xmath103 .",
    "this contrasts with the case of the inertia - driven migration , to which the wide - gap theory demonstrated a robust applicability in prediction over a wide range of @xmath4 .",
    "the present simulation consistently served as bridge between the wide- and narrow - gap theories ( see figure [ fig : migvel_comp_lub ] ) as long as the bubble deformation is assumed to be infinitesimal .",
    "however , in spite of the qualitative success of the simulation in revealing the narrow - gap repulsive force , the deformation - induced migration velocity in the experiment is considerably higher by a factor of about 3 than the simulated one , as shown in figure [ fig : migvel_comp_exp ] .",
    "the experiment may inevitably involve unknown factors such as unsteadiness , imperfection from the infinite plate - fluid system , and measurement uncertainty , which can not be captured by the simulation .",
    "nevertheless , we have not expected such a large discrepancy because firstly the quantitative agreement between the interfacial deflections of the experiment and the simulation has been confirmed in figures [ fig : scale_deform ] and [ fig : deformationr_kap ] , secondly the consistent inertia - driven migration velocity of a rigid sphere with the available theories ( @xcite ) has been obtained by @xcite using the same experimental setup , and thirdly considerable uncertainty seems not to be introduced into such a simple system as illustrated in figure [ fig : schem ] .",
    "further joint researches among theory , numerics and experiment are needed to resolve this problem . as a possible factor causing the inconsistency , we raise a difference between the bubble deformation levels of the experiment and the present analysis . as stated in ",
    "[ sec : abe_lub ] , the infinitesimal deformation assumption in the lubrication limit is justified only for the case that @xmath168 . beyond this limitation , unexplored hydrodynamic ingredients",
    "possibly become important on the bubble migration .",
    "for the experimental data shown in figure [ fig : migvel_comp_exp ] and figure [ fig : migvel_comp_lub ] , the maximum value of @xmath121 is @xmath169 , which is less than but comparable to unity .",
    "therefore , the bubble deformation is finite rather than infinitesimal , and is likely to induce the higher - order force , which is possibly comparable to or stronger than the leading migration force evaluated with the infinitesimal deformation theories . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "a tiny bubble experiment , which results in a tiny capillary number and thus a tiny deformation , is favorable for comparative study .",
    "however , such an experiment has often resulted in an undetectably low migration velocity and made an accurate measurement difficult . to overcome such a dilemma , the highly accurate boundary element computations ( e.g. @xcite ) for various deformation levels would be helpful to complement the infinitesimal deformation theories .",
    "we thank shu takagi for fruitful discussion .",
    "we describe the basic equation set in the bipolar coordinates ( see e.g. @xcite  appendix a-19 ) as illustrated in figure [ fig : schem_bipolar](a ) .",
