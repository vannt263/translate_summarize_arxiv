    "large vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) for flat directions in supersymmetric ( susy ) theories , i.e. , directions in the field space of scalars that have a flat potential , can affect the thermal history of the universe in two ways as discussed in the literature .",
    "firstly , they may delay the thermalization of the inflaton decay products @xcite .",
    "secondly , the flat directions could potentially dominate over the inflaton decay products @xcite , such that reheating is associated with the decay of flat directions as opposed to the decay of the inflaton .",
    "below we shall consider gravitino production in the context of flat directions delaying thermalization of the decay products of the inflaton which are presumed to dominate the universe .",
    "gauge symmetries are broken along flat directions and for certain flat directions all standard model ( sm ) gauge symmetries are broken in the early universe .",
    "( low energy phenomenology is not affected as the vevs of these flat directions ultimately disappear . ) in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors have presented an interesting scenario in which flat directions give a large mass @xmath0 to all gauge bosons and gauginos where @xmath1 is the vev of the field @xmath2 that parametrizes the flat direction and @xmath3 for gauge coupling constant @xmath4 . since processes involving",
    "gauge bosons are important for thermalization , this results in a slow rate of thermalization after the end of inflation .",
    "thus the universe enters a period of pre - thermalization after inflation . throughout this article",
    "we use the term thermalization to refer to chemical equilibration , and thermal equilibrium to refer to chemical equilibrium .    in the scenario of refs .",
    "@xcite the universe reaches a state of kinetic equilibrium via @xmath5 interactions after a certain time interval has elapsed following inflaton decay .",
    "further thermal equilibrium is reached only when number violating interactions , i.e. , @xmath6 interactions , are also effective .",
    "thus the rate of inflaton decay , of kinetic equilibration and of thermal equilibration follow the relation @xmath7 where @xmath8 and we define @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 as the times of inflaton decay , kinetic equilibration and chemical equilibration respectively .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors argue that due to the delay in thermalization the generic problem of gravitino overproduction in susy models is also avoided .",
    "the lack of thermalization leads to a dilute plasma of high energy particles , and the low number density of particles effectively leads to low gravitino production .",
    "moreover due to a low final reheat temperature after thermalization gravitino production after thermalization is also suppressed .    in this article",
    "we provide a detailed analysis of gravitino production in the non - thermal universe scenario of refs .",
    "@xcite . to find the number density of gravitinos @xmath12 , refs .",
    "@xcite use the integrated boltzmann equation of the form @xmath13 from inflaton decay till thermal equilibration for the process @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are quarks or squarks and @xmath17 is a gauge boson or a gaugino .",
    "we too obtain and use this equation , but only for @xmath18 where one can describe the particle distribution function by a thermal distribution with an effective chemical potential . for @xmath19",
    "we instead use a delta function distribution function for the incoming particles and then evaluate the collision integral for the integrated boltzman equation . as part of our analysis , we have also explicitly obtained the conditions for obtaining a non - thermal universe after inflaton decay .",
    "there is an important effect associated with large vevs of the flat directions as relevant for gravitino production that has not been considered earlier .",
    "gauge bosons and gauginos are produced along with gravitinos in the relevant processes for gravitino production .",
    "as mentioned above these get large masses @xmath20 due to the large vevs of the flat directions .",
    "consequently gravitino production ceases in cases where the energy of quarks and squarks in the universe falls below the mass of gauge bosons and gauginos due to phase space suppression .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite we consider two cases , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the condensate mass .",
    "we find that for @xmath21 phase space suppression shuts off gravitino production both before thermalization and even after thermalization , till the condensate decays .",
    "for @xmath22 , gravitino production is shut off after thermalization due to phase space suppression till the condensate decays .",
    "it should be noted here that the longevity of these flat directions has been in dispute @xcite .",
    "one of the key issues is whether or not non - perturbative effects lead to a fast decay of the condensate . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that non - perturbative decay due to parametric resonance is suppressed for a complex scalar condensate if the real and imaginary parts of the scalar field oscillate out of phase . in that case",
    "the field does not pass through the minimum of the potential at @xmath24 and so the required non - adiabatic condition @xmath25 is not satisfied , where @xmath26 is the the frequency of the @xmath27-th mode of the @xmath28 field produced by the decay of the condensate .",
    "( backreaction effects can also be important in suppressing non - perturbative decay . )",
    "the condensate then decays only perturbatively and hence lasts for a long time .",
    "@xcite however argued that in the case of multiple flat directions there is a mixing of excitations along different directions which makes non - perturbative effects important .",
    "further investigations in ref .",
    "@xcite implied that even with multiple flat directions resonant decay is most likely to be suppressed ( in cases of physical interest ) because the multiple flat directions effectively reduce to one flat direction or a collection of independent single flat directions . raising certain issues related to gauge fixing , refs .",
    "@xcite worked in the unitary gauge to eliminate the nambu - goldstone boson that appears in the context of susy flat directions charged under the gauge group of the mssm and studied the circumstances under which the presence of multiple flat directions can lead to non - perturbative decay . ref .",
    "@xcite invoked charge conservation to argue that non - perturbative decay is suppressed . at the same time ref .",
    "@xcite analysed the issue with proper gauge fixing and concluded that with one flat direction there is no resonant particle production , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , while disagreeing with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of multiple flat directions",
    ". however refs .",
    "@xcite argue that even if non - perturbative decay occurs for multiple flat directions it leads to redistribution of energy of the condensate amongst the fields in the d flat superspace and hence to practically the same cosmological consequences ( including large gauge boson and gaugino masses and delayed thermalization ) as in the scenario with only perturbative decay .",
    "our analysis below presumes that perturbative decay is the relevant decay mechanism of the flat direction condensate and that the impact of the condensate lasts long enough to have cosmological consequences .",
    "this may be because either there is only a single flat direction that is excited , or because the multiple flat directions are excited such that parametric resonance is still suppressed , or because of the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite , or because of backreaction effects .",
    "there are other effects that affect the evolution and decay of the flat direction condensate .",
    "thermal contributions to the condensate potential can change the mass of the condensate leading to an earlier oscillation time for the condensate @xcite .",
    "below we take the condensate mass to be of order of the susy breaking scale @xmath29 .",
    "we present our results in terms of @xmath23 which can be replaced by larger values to include these effects .",
    "@xcite obtains masses of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 where terms that lift the flat directions have the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 . )",
    "another effect is that the condensate can decay due to scattering by inflaton decay products @xcite .",
    "both these effects have been discussed in appendix a.4 of ref .",
    "@xcite where it has been argued that these effects will not be relevant during the non - thermal phase .",
    "the flat direction condensate can also decay to q - balls due to inhomogeneities in the condensate field .",
    "this has been studied in the context of both gauge mediated and gravity mediated susy breaking @xcite .",
    "in addition it has been seen that condensate lumps with different properties than q - balls called q - axitons may also be formed @xcite .",
    "note however that the time scale for the formation of q - balls and q - axitons can be large .",
    "for gauge mediated susy breaking scenarios the time scale for q - ball formation @xmath35 @xcite , where @xmath36 is a characteristic mass scale for the flat direction condensate , and for gravity mediated susy breaking scenarios @xmath37 @xcite or @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "@xcite also obtains a q - ball formation time which is larger than the flat direction oscillation time by a factor of @xmath39 .",
    "the time scale for q - axiton formation is @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "q - ball formation may be avoided for certain flat directions , including those with a large stop admixture , which allow for @xmath41 , where @xmath17 is a parameter in the potential in gauge mediated susy breaking scenarios @xcite .",
