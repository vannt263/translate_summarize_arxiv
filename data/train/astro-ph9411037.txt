    "the galactic center region is a luminous source of 511 kev x - ray line emission resulting from electron - positron annihilation .",
    "the line has two components : a diffuse and steady component resulting from annihilation of positrons produced by novae and supernovae in the interstellar medium , and a time - variable component , long believed to originate in a black hole or neutron star , dubbed the `` great annihilator '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of the time - variable line indicate that the annihilation region is small , @xmath4 cm , dense , @xmath5 @xmath6 , and cold , @xmath7 k. this annihilation environment is very different from the high energy environment in which the positrons are produced , e.g. an accretion disk near a black hole , and there is considerable interest in identifying the source of the positrons .    the hard x - ray source e ( sunyaev et al .",
    "1991 ) is a strong candidate for the positron source .",
    "the emerging picture of e is the following ( @xcite;@xcite ) : it is a compact object , probably a stellar - mass black hole , on the edge of a molecular cloud ( mirabel et al .",
    "1991 ; bally & levanthal 1991 ) .",
    "the high - energy emission arises from an accretion disk with instabilities giving rise to pair production and annihilation which in turn produces the excess above 300 kev .",
    "the accretion disk collimates some of the pairs to form jets which are visible as bipolar radio lobes ( mirabel et al .",
    "the pairs in the jets travel about 1 pc before slowing and thermalizing in the cold , dense environment of the molecular cloud where any remaining positrons are annihilated .",
    "the details of this picture are controversial .",
    "it is not clear whether the source of accreted material is a stellar companion or perhaps the molecular cloud itself ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is that the radio lobes around e are extra - galactic ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but mirabel & rodriguez ( 1993 ) have recently detected changes in the flux density of the radio lobes at the 3@xmath8 level which suggest that the source is closer than 17 kpc .",
    "one way to establish the galactic origin of e would be to prove a physical connection between the x - ray source and the molecular cloud .",
    "a drawback of previous observations of the molecular cloud is that they were made with single - dish telescopes and have moderate to poor angular resolution . to explore the relationship between e and the molecular cloud",
    ", we undertook interferometric observations in the hco@xmath9 line .",
    "hco@xmath0 is believed to be a tracer of energetic outflows in molecular gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and we hoped to detect hco@xmath0 emission from the vicinity of the radio lobes around e. in  2 we describe the observations and  3 we discuss the images we obtained and their implications for the great annihilator .",
    "we observed hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) line emission from e using the owens valley radio observatory millimeter interferometer .",
    "the primary beam width of the 10.4 m ovro antennas ( 65  fwhm ) was only slightly larger than the 1extent of the radio jets ( mirabel et al .",
    "1992 ) , so we used four overlapping pointings to map the field around e. we observed two of the four fields during the period 1992 december - 1993 july when the array consisted of four dishes with cryogenically - cooled sis receivers .",
    "the two pointings ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , epoch 1950.0 ) were centered on the vla jets and offset by about @xmath14 from the x - ray core .",
    "we alternated 5 minute integrations between the two phase centers , observing the nearby point source nrao530 every 20 minutes to monitor the phase behavior of the array .",
    "the absolute flux scale was determined from observations of uranus and neptune .",
    "we observed 3c273 ( @xmath15 jy ) for at least 15 minutes per transit to obtain a high signal - to - noise passband calibration .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 8 hours per field and the average single - sideband system temperature was 640 k.    in 1993 september we observed two more pointings offset from the x - ray source by @xmath16 west and northwest , respectively ; the phase centers were @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 . by 1993 september",
    "the interferometer had been upgraded to five elements , but otherwise the equipment and observing procedures were the same as before .",
    "the total integration time per field was 2.4 hours and the mean single - sideband system temperature was 480 k.    during the observations we operated a digital spectrometer divided into two bands . a 32 mhz",
    "( 108 km s@xmath2 ) band with 128 frequency channels was centered on the hco@xmath0 transition frequency ( 89.189 ghz ) and doppler shifted to an lsr velocity of @xmath21 km s@xmath2 . a second",
    ", lower - resolution band with 128 mhz bandwidth ( 431 km s@xmath2 ) and 128 frequency channels was doppler shifted to @xmath22 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the high - resolution band was centered on a strong hco@xmath0 line observed by mirabel et al .",
    "( 1991 ) using the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "the low - resolution band covered the velocity range -200 to + 100 km s@xmath2 where other molecular species have been detected in the direction of e ( @xcite ) .",
    "we calibrated the data using software specific to the ovro millimeter interferometer and imaged each of the four fields using aips .",
    "although the data for the first two and the second two fields were obtained with different numbers of telescopes and array configurations , the u - v coverage was very similar for the four data sets .",
    "natural weighting of the visibility data gave a @xmath23 clean beam at position angle 6  for each field .",
    "there was strong hco@xmath0 emission at velocities near -140 km s@xmath2 in each of the four images .",
    "figure 1 shows the low - resolution hco@xmath0 spectrum averaged over areas of all four images where the line was above the noise .",
    "we integrated the image cubes over the velocity range -142.5 to -125.7 km s@xmath2 where the line emission was strongest , and mosaicked the four images using standard aips tasks .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting image .    in fig .",
    "2 the three ` @xmath24s ' correspond to the tip of the northward - pointing vla radio jet , the flat - spectrum radio core , and the tip of the southern jet , respectively . the hco@xmath0 emission does not coincide with the location of e , but it does lie along a ridge 15  to the west , oriented roughly parallel to the jets .",
    "the high resolution hco@xmath0 spectra ( not shown ) indicate a slight velocity gradient along the ridge . as one moves south from the northern tip of the ridge the velocity of the hco@xmath0 line increases from -142 km s@xmath2 to -138 km s@xmath2 over a distance of 50  ( 2 pc at the galactic center . )",
    "the southernmost part of the ridge  a single - contoured `` blob '' near the lowest ` @xmath24 ' in figure 2  is at a velocity of -130 km s@xmath2 .",
    "it may therefore be a cloudlet which is not associated with the rest of the ridge , but appears to be so in projection along the line of sight .",
    "figure 2 clearly shows that there is no detectable hco@xmath0 emission near the radio lobes or the x - ray source . in this section",
    "we discuss whether the absence of hco@xmath0 emission is consistent with e being the great annihilator .",
    "krolik & kallman ( 1983 ) have considered molecular cloud chemistry in the presence of ionization from embedded x - ray sources .",
    "they found that x - ray chemistry is very much like cosmic - ray powered chemistry in that it is the secondary electrons from x - ray ionizations which perform most of the chemically important ionizations .",
    "consequently , the important factor in assessing molecular abundances is the ionization rate .",
    "although they were concerned with sources of soft x - rays ( primarily stellar ) , their results are applicable here because the molecular cloud is optically thin at high energies , and soft x - rays ( @xmath25 kev ) will be most important for the chemistry of the cloud .    at low to moderately high ionization rates , @xmath26 s@xmath2 ,",
    "the abundance of hco@xmath0 increases with increasing ionization rate .",
    "however , at very high ionization rates , @xmath27 s@xmath2 , the hco@xmath0 abundance begins to decrease with increasing ionization rates ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , a possible explanation for the lack of hco@xmath0 emission in the neighborhood of e is that a sufficiently high ionization rate either destroys any existing hco@xmath0 or inhibits its formation .",
    "we have calculated the ionization rate in the neighborhood of e. our model assumes that the emergent spectrum of e is that of a comptonized disk ( fig . 6 of churazov , 1993 ) and that the source is surrounded by atomic hydrogen of uniform density , @xmath28 .",
    "we have assumed atomic rather than molecular hydrogen because the photoionization cross section of molecular hydrogen is poorly known at high energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used the approximate expressions given by shapiro , lightman , & eardley ( 1976 ) to calculate the emergent spectrum from the disk .",
    "as we have already discussed , most of the ionization is due to softer photons , @xmath29 kev , about which little or no information exists .",
    "hence , we shall be forced to extrapolate this spectrum to much lower energies .",
    "provided that the spectrum continues to increase to lower energies , rather than levelling off or falling , we expect our conclusions to be reasonably robust .",
    "note that an implicit assumption of a comptonized disk spectrum model is that there exists a central source which produces a copious number of photons well below the lower limit at which e has been detected , @xmath30 kev .",
    "hence , to the extent that the comptonized disk spectrum is an accurate model for e , our ionization rates may be underestimates , potentially by a large factor .",
    "the ionization rate as a function of distance from the x - ray source is shown in fig . 3 for various ambient atomic hydrogen densities .",
    "for a dense cloud , @xmath31 to @xmath32 @xmath6 , the ionization rate drops to @xmath1 s@xmath2 about 1 pc from the x - ray source .",
    "this is in good accord with the projected separation we observe between e and the hco@xmath0 ridge , @xmath33 pc at the galactic center .",
    "given the numerous uncertainties in the problem we regard this agreement with our observations as remarkably good .",
    "these ionization rates are not sufficiently high to produce any substantial fractional ionization .",
    "we estimate that the gas in the neighborhood of e should be neutral to a few parts in @xmath34 , assuming a nominal density and temperature of @xmath32 @xmath6 and @xmath34 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the radio continuum observations of mirabel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and anantharamaiah et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who found no region near e. hence , this cloud could serve as the cold , dense annihilation region for the great annihilator .",
    "a more conclusive link between the molecular cloud and e could be obtained by imaging the field around e in the lines of molecules which have enhanced abundances in high - ionization environments .",
    "millimeter - wavelength transitions of cn and hcn@xmath0 are ideal for this purpose .",
    "krolik & kallman ( 1983 ) discuss these and other molecules marked by increasing abundances even at ionization rates as high as @xmath35 s@xmath2 .",
    "the detection of such molecules near the core of e would definitively establish the galactic origin of this object ."
