    "the @xmath0-ray line at 4.438 mev from the deexcitation of the first excited state of @xmath1c is one of the strongest nuclear lines , clearly visible in several energetic solar flares , which were observed in particular by the gamma ray spectrometer aboard the smm satellite @xcite and one of the best candidates for an observation at @xmath0-ray energies of the interaction of low energy cosmic rays in nearby molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "it is mainly produced by inelastic scattering of energetic protons and @xmath2-particles off @xmath1c and by the spallation of @xmath3o by the same particles @xcite .",
    "this line is also produced in reverse kinematics by accelerated @xmath1c and @xmath3o bombarding the ambient hydrogen and helium nuclei , with however a large doppler broadening due to the high velocities of the emitting @xmath1c nucleus , which makes its detection much more difficult . in the following",
    "we will refer to @xmath0-ray lines produced by light ion bombardment of the ambient gas as the narrow component and to @xmath0-rays produced by accelerated heavy ions as the broad component .",
    "accordingly , the intensity and shape of the narrow component of the 4.438 mev line depend on the properties of the accelerated light particle spectrum and the @xmath1c and @xmath3o abundances in the interaction site .",
    "the narrow line intensities from various isotopes can be used to derive accelerated particle and ambient gas abundances , as it has been done for example by murphy et al .",
    "@xcite for the solar flare of 1981 , april 27 .",
    "more detailed information on the energy spectrum of the accelerated particles and their directional distribution at the interaction site may however only be obtained by a detailed line shape analysis .",
    "murphy , kozlovsky and ramaty @xcite investigated the impact of different accelerated particle angular distributions on the narrow component of the 4.438 mev @xmath0-ray line produced by the p + @xmath1c reaction .",
    "the shape of the broad component has been discussed by bykov , bozhokin and bloemen @xcite and by kozlovsky , ramaty and lingenfelter @xcite .",
    "these studies are based on the experimentally well - known excitation functions , some available experimental data on differential cross sections , few published results on measured line shapes , and theoretical arguments .",
    "for the spallation reaction , the situation is similar with respect to available experimental data .",
    "the excitation function is experimentally determined from threshold up to over 100 mev , but few data are available on differential cross sections and line shapes .    in order to put the calculations for the 4.438 mev line on a firmer basis , we use additionally to the already published data the extensive data set on @xmath0-ray angular distributions and @xmath0-ray line shapes for the @xmath1c(p , p@xmath0 ) and @xmath3o(p , p@xmath5 ) reaction , obtained in a recent accelerator experiment at orsay @xcite . for the spallation reaction , the reproduction of the observed line shapes for proton energies between 16 and 20 mev proved to be only sensitive to the mean excitation energy of the @xmath2-particle emitting intermediate states of @xmath3o .",
    "estimations of the mean excitation energy for higher proton energies and for the differential cross sections are based on published data in the proton energy range 40 - 50 mev and optical model ( om ) calculations .    for proton inelastic scattering ,",
    "we adopted a method similar to that of murphy , kozlovsky and ramaty @xcite for line shape calculations .",
    "two independent amplitudes for the magnetic substate population of the 2@xmath4 level and a phase shift were adjusted to reproduce both the experimental line shapes and the laboratory @xmath0-ray angular distributions in the proton energy range from 8.6 mev to 19.75 mev .",
    "the extrapolations to higher energies are based on om calculations using phenomenological potential parameters , which proved to give an excellent reproduction of measured differential cross sections for nucleon elastic and inelastic scattering off @xmath1c at projectile energies e @xmath6 20 - 100 mev @xcite .",
    "@xmath2-particle inelastic scattering off @xmath1c and spallation of @xmath3o suffer from a complete absence of published data on line shapes .",
    "therefore , estimations of the mean excitation energy in @xmath3o for the spallation reaction were entirely based on om calculations and an experimental @xmath2-particle spectrum at @xmath7 = 60 mev . for the inelastic scattering reaction , differential cross sections d@xmath8/d@xmath9 and some laboratory @xmath0-ray angular distributions have been used to find the parameters for the @xmath0-ray emission based on the population amplitude method at @xmath2-particle energies below 20 mev , while at higher energies the needed parameters were obtained from om calculations .    in the last section we discuss the production of the 4.438 mev line in solar flares and show some calculated shapes for the narrow component of the 4.438 mev line induced by proton and @xmath2-particle interactions in the solar atmosphere as it may be observed by the hessi spacecraft @xcite .",

    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite . as no systematic deviation of one of the data sets can be observed , no cross section value was discarded .",
    "we therefore fitted the excitation function curve above 23 mev .",
    "assigning the same weight to each data point , the overall shape of the excitation function curve from 23 mev to 146 mev could be best fitted by a power law plus a constant .",
    "the fit is very close to the curve in fig.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite for this reaction .",
    "the obtained cross sections values are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "for proton energies below 50 mev , that reaction should proceed principally from a sequential process with the excitation of intermediate states of @xmath3o , decaying subsequently to @xmath2 + @xmath1c@xmath12 .",
    "reactions with other particles than the @xmath2-particle in the outgoing channel , like @xmath13he + n or @xmath13h + p have thresholds @xmath6 20 mev higher , around @xmath11 = 35 mev , and should be negligible for the production of @xmath1c@xmath12 in solar flares . the sequential character can be deduced from a study of the @xmath3o(p , p@xmath2)@xmath1c reaction at a proton energy of 46.8 mev , where no evidence for quasi - elastic p-@xmath2 scattering was found @xcite .",
    "still other reaction paths , such as @xmath3o(p,@xmath2)@xmath14n@xmath15 @xmath16 p + @xmath1c@xmath12 were also found negligible . at lower energies",
    "these reaction mechanisms should be still weaker .",
    "we adopted in the following exclusively the sequential process @xmath3o(p , p)@xmath3o@xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath2 + @xmath1c@xmath12 .",
    "parameters entering into the line shape determination are therefore the relative contribution of the different excited states in @xmath3o and for each excited state the differential cross section with respect to the recoiling @xmath3o@xmath15 scattering angle , the @xmath1c@xmath15-@xmath3o angular correlation and the @xmath0-@xmath1c angular correlation . given the scarcity of experimental data and the number of excited states involved , it is highly impracticable if not impossible to undergo a full and correct calculation for numerous proton energies from threshold to 100 mev .",
    "one can , however , reasonably assume that the average angular distribution of the @xmath2-@xmath1c@xmath15 decay in the recoiling @xmath3o@xmath15 system and the angular distribution of the @xmath0-ray emission in the @xmath1c@xmath15 system are isotropic , because of the contribution of many @xmath3o levels with different spin and parity ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "in this energy range , experimental line shapes are available from a recent accelerator experiment at orsay @xcite at six different @xmath0-ray detection angles , ranging from 45@xmath17 to 145@xmath17 with respect to the incoming beam direction and at four proton energies .",
    "these experimental line shapes were compared with calculated ones obtained with the use of a monte - carlo type program . in this program reaction parameter inputs were the differential cross section with respect to the proton center - of - mass scattering angle and the mean excitation energy in @xmath3o . as mentionned above , the vector of the @xmath2-@xmath1c@xmath15 decay in the @xmath3o@xmath15 system and the @xmath0-ray emission in the @xmath1c@xmath15 system were taken isotropically .",
    "slowing down of the carbon in the target with exponentially decaying @xmath0-ray emission probability corresponding to the lifetime of the 4.439 mev state , as well as the full detector geometry and resolution were taken into account to generate theoretical detector spectra . stopping powers",
    "were taken from the code trim @xcite .",
    "optical - model calculations of inelastic proton scattering off @xmath3o to states from 12.75 mev to 17 mev , with optical potential parameters from the compilation of perey and perey @xcite were performed to obtain the differential inelastic scattering cross sections d@xmath8/d@xmath18 .",
    "the calculated cross sections were found to be roughly isotropic in this proton energy range . as furthermore the calculated line shapes proved to be not very sensitive to the details of the differential cross section , we simply used a constant d@xmath8/d@xmath18 .",
    "the mean excitation energy @xmath19@xmath20 in @xmath3o was then the only parameter that has been adjusted to reproduce the experimental @xmath0-ray spectra .",

    "position , line shape and relative intensities of the experimental lines are fairly well reproduced by the calculation , which gives credit to the validity of the assumption of essentially isotropic angular distributions .",
    "we also checked that calculations with a gaussian distribution of the excitation energy centered at @xmath19@xmath20 resulted in practically identical line shapes .",

    "we also assumed that the total cross section for each state is proportional to the differential cross section at 40@xmath17 .",

    "production of 4.438 mev @xmath0-ray emission by inelastic scattering off @xmath1c originates mainly from direct excitation of the 2@xmath4 , 4.439 mev level .",

    "however , these two parameters were not sufficient and it proved to be necessary for a simultaneous reproduction of the line shapes and the @xmath0-ray angular distribution to introduce a third independent parameter .",
    "we found that a phase shift @xmath63 for the azimuthal angle improved considerably the fits and gave a satisfactory reproduction of the orsay data at most proton energies .",
