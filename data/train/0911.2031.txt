    "we represent a common subsequence by aligning the letters of the subsequences from each word .",
    "the letters which do not appear in the common subsequence get aligned with a gap ; several alignments can represent the same common subsequence . in this first example",
    ", an alignment corresponding to the common subsequence @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 however , the lcs is not @xmath9 , but @xmath11 .",
    "we call an alignment corresponding to the lcs an _ optimal alignment_. hence , is not an optimal alignment , but an optimal alignment is given by : @xmath12 here the lcs is @xmath13 , and its length is 3 a fact that we denote by @xmath14 let us consider another example : let @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "in this situation , the lcs of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath17 and the alignment with gaps representing the lcs is : @xmath18 again , all the letters which are part of the lcs get aligned with each other , while the other letters get aligned with gaps .",
    "often , we say that , in a given alignment , a part of @xmath0 gets aligned with a part of @xmath1 , and here is what is meant : in the above example , @xmath19 is aligned with @xmath20 , while @xmath21 is aligned ( with gaps ) with @xmath22 .",

    "( we will also sometimes say that @xmath23 $ ] gets mapped onto @xmath24 $ ] by the alignment we consider ) .",

    "in other words , we say that in an alignment a piece of @xmath0 gets aligned with a piece of @xmath1 , if and only if the letters from the piece of @xmath0 which get aligned to letters get only aligned with letters from the piece of @xmath1 and vice versa .",
    "+ longest common subsequences ( lcs ) and optimal alignments ( oa ) are important tools used in computational biology and computational linguistics for string matching , e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is known and due to chvtal and sankoff @xcite that the expected length of the lcs divided by @xmath29 converges to a constant @xmath30 .",
    "but even for the simplest distributions , the exact value of @xmath30 is not known    in several special cases ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the long open problem of finding the order of the variance of the lcs and the oa has been solved . such is the case , for example , with binary sequences with @xmath31 and @xmath32 having very different probabilities from each other . in all these cases",
    ", it turned out that the variance of the lcs is of linear order in the length of the sequences .",

    "the most important cases , like for example i.i.d . sequences with equiprobable letters remain , however , open as far as this order is concerned . + in @xcite and @xcite , for determining the linear order of the variance of the lcs , we used ad - hoc ( somewhat intricate ) combinatorial arguments , despite the fact that the situation there is less involved than for the general case . in this paper , we show a general method to prove certain properties of the optimal alignment , given that typically the property holds for alignments of short strings .",
    "+ we investigate here the nature of the optimal alignments of random strings , i.e. , of the alignments corresponding to lcss . for this , and throughout ,",

    "we denote by @xmath6 the length of the lcs of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "to do so , we are going to partition @xmath2 into pieces of length @xmath33 , fixed , as n goes to infinity , and prove that typically , in any optimal alignment , most of these pieces get aligned with pieces of @xmath3 of similar length .",
    "more precisely , we assume throughout that @xmath34    assume that the integers    @xmath35    are such that    @xmath36    the above condition just indicates that there exists an optimal alignment which maps @xmath37 $ ] onto @xmath38 $ ] for all @xmath39",

    "+ on the other hand , we could envision using montecarlo simulation in order to find a likely bound for the probability on the left side of . things then become much more difficult .",
    "assume that you want @xmath133 to be @xmath257 and take @xmath258 .",
    "then , by condition you find that @xmath33 must be larger than : @xmath259 the probability not to have property @xmath40 for strings of length approximately @xmath33 must be less ( see ) than @xmath260 , so that with our previous bound on @xmath33,we would get less than @xmath261 the above number is way too small for montecarlo simulations ! indeed , to show that a probability is as small as @xmath262 , one would need to run an order of @xmath263 simulations .",
    "there are several ways to improve on our bounds .",
    "first , we took as upper bound for @xmath216 the value @xmath264 .",
    "one can find a better upper bound as follows : first note that if @xmath265 , then at least @xmath217 of the lengths @xmath266 are in the interval @xmath134 $ ] . to determine these lengths we have at most @xmath267 choices .",
    "then , there can be as many as @xmath135 of the lengths @xmath266 , which are not in @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "choosing those lengths is like choosing at most @xmath135 points from a set of at most @xmath29 elements .",
    "hence , we get as upper bound @xmath268 which , in turn , can be bounded by @xmath269 finally , we have to decide which among the @xmath96 lengths @xmath126 have there length in @xmath131 $ ] and which have not .",
    "that choice is bounded as follows :",
    "@xmath270 combining the bounds , and , yields @xmath271            \\(i ) @xmath275 ( ii ) assuming that @xmath232 denotes the maximum for @xmath113 ranging over @xmath131 $ ] of the probability that the property @xmath40 does not holds for @xmath276 , the second condition is @xmath277 combining the last two conditions above yields :      the typical situation is that @xmath279 should be of a given order .",
    "so , we will try to find @xmath280 and @xmath281 under the constraint @xmath282 , so that the right bound in is least small . for this note",
    "first that the power @xmath283 has much more effect on making the bound small than the expression @xmath284 on top of the fraction bar . + note that @xmath285 is just going to be a value between @xmath32 and @xmath109 , and so will not have a lot of influence .",
    "also , @xmath286 is somewhat negligible compared to @xmath287 .",
    "so we are first going to disregard the quantities @xmath286 and @xmath288 .",
    "for this let @xmath289 be equal to @xmath290 note that @xmath289 is larger than the bound on the right side of .",
    "this means that if @xmath289 is too small for allowing some montecarlo simulation , then the bound is also too small ! +",
    "note also , that when we hold all the parameters ( @xmath291 ) fixed , the function @xmath289 is decreasing in @xmath281 as well as in @xmath280 .",
    "however , as already mentioned , @xmath281 `` has more effect '' in decreasing @xmath289 than @xmath280 .",
    "hence , given @xmath133 and given all that all the parameters are fixed ( including @xmath33 ) , when we want to maximize @xmath289 under the constrain @xmath292 , @xmath293 we get something where @xmath281 will be quite a bit larger than @xmath280 .",
    "+ * could montecarlo simulations be realistic with @xmath294 and the bounds which we have ? *",
    "the answer is no . for this note that @xmath295 gets at first better when we increase @xmath296 , since @xmath45 has @xmath31 derivative at @xmath50 . when the interval @xmath131 $ ] becomes too big however , than the property might no longer hold with high probability for all couple @xmath297 with @xmath244 $ ] .",
    "so , we will take @xmath298 $ ] so large as possible around @xmath32 , so that property still holds with high probability for all the string pairs mentioned before .",
    "with such a choice we get that @xmath295 can be treated as a constant .",
    "somewhat optimistically say that the constant is less than @xmath299 . now if @xmath294 , then @xmath300 . in that case , @xmath301 returning to inequality @xmath302 and taking @xmath303 , we find that @xmath33 must be larger than @xmath304 , so that @xmath305 is more than @xmath306 . with this in mind , we find that @xmath289 in the present case where @xmath307 is less than @xmath308 , so no hope for montecarlo simulation here ! + * motecarlo with @xmath309 and @xmath310 : * take also @xmath303 and @xmath311 . with these values , using we find that @xmath33 must be somewhat larger than @xmath312 .",
    "then , also @xmath232 by should be less than @xmath313 this is still an order that is difficult for montecarlo simulation , but we get closer to something which could be realistic .",
    "now if we had @xmath314 instead , then we would get a bound @xmath315 which still does not look too good for montecarlo simulation ! + * when only dealing with the inequality * , things look somewhat better .",
    "take @xmath316 and @xmath317 , then the order for the left bound for @xmath232 is about @xmath318 which is feasible with montecarlo !",
    "so , if we could find another method than the one described here to make sure that most of the pieces of strings @xmath88 are aligned with pieces of similar length we would be in business !"
