    "although rf traps use a combination of quasistatic and rf electrical fields to confine charged particles , we will here only be concerned with the rf component . for typical qip ion traps , the dimensions ( @xmath0 ) and rf frequencies ( @xmath1 ) are such that we can adequately treat the rf field as quasistatic and express the time dependent rf field as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the rf frequency and spatially varying amplitude , respectively .",
    "the rf period @xmath5 is made to be the fastest time scale of the trap , so that in the adiabatic limit the effect of the field can be described by an external ponderomotive potential @xmath6 given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the mass and charge of the trapped particle @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , it suffices to note that @xmath10 is proportional to the square of the local rf field amplitude .",
    "since confinement by electrostatic fields is impossible , the rf field must always be present to allow trapping , and we will assume @xmath11 to be constant as is usually the case in qip ion traps . in this case , @xmath6 constitutes a constant `` landscape '' in which ions can be shuffled around by manipulating a quasistatic control field provided by dedicated trap electrodes . as mentioned above , we are here only interested in the structure of this landscape , which is determined entirely by the electrode geometry and is independent of the amplitude and frequency of the applied rf field .    for an ideal trap network , as introduced in the introduction , we require that the @xmath11 vanishes for @xmath12 on a network path and only there .",
    "ideal networks have a number of qualities .",
    "firstly , the ions do not experience any rf - induced micromotion .",
    "micromotion is especially critical in trap regions where gate operations are performed @xcite , but could also potentially lead to heating effects @xcite .",
    "secondly , the ponderomotive potential associated with a nonzero rf field along trap paths complicates fully controlled ion transport because the applied control fields must be engineered to compensate for any curvature of @xmath6 along the path in order to avoid motional heating of the ions @xcite .",
    "note that such compensation is impossible for the transport of multispecies crystals , which according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ppdef ] ) experience different ponderomotive potentials due to mass differences .",
    "lastly , the requirement that @xmath10 vanishes only on the network paths ensures that ions are confined , even in the absence of control fields .",
    "an ideal 1d trap network can be implemented with segmented linear rf traps @xcite where the rf field forms a quadrupole with a line of zero rf field along the trap axis @xcite , so that the isosurfaces of @xmath6 are concentric cylinders around the axis . in this case ,",
    "transport as well as splitting and joining of groups of ions have been demonstrated to be possible with a very high degree of control @xcite .",
    "we should note that although our quest in the following is for ideal trap networks , none of the conditions for a network to be ideal in the sense introduced above are absolute requirements for a network to be suitable for even large scale qip .",
    "firstly , it has been proposed that transport in a network that is not fully confining can be achieved by `` surfing '' around any leaks @xcite .",
    "secondly , even in the presence of residual a rf field along the network path , it can be possible to perform highly controlled ion transport so that no or minimal heating takes place @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that an ideal network would have a number of operational benefits .",
    "as a first step to constructing an ideal 2d intersection , we will study the possible local structure of @xmath11 at the intersection of two smooth network paths in terms of a multipole expansion .",
    "our goal is to find the lowest order multipole term that can contribute to @xmath11 .",
    "identifying the lowest possible multipole order is desirable for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the confinement that can be produced for a given ion - electrode distance is stronger for lower - order multipole fields @xcite .",
    "keeping the ion - electrode distance as large as possible is important since ion heating has been repeatedly demonstrated to increase dramatically with decreasing ion - electrode distance @xcite .",
    "secondly , the construction of an intersection where all low - order multipole terms vanish is technically challenging . by trapping with the lowest order multipole possible",
    ", a smaller number of terms must be made to vanish .    with this in mind , we expand @xmath11 around the intersection point chosen as the origin , @xmath13 where the tensors @xmath14 and @xmath15 describe the quadrupole and hexapole components of the field . here , as in the remainder of the paper , we have adopted the convention that summation over repeated indices is implied , e.g.  @xmath16 .",
    "it follows from maxwell s equations that @xmath11 must be irrotational and divergence - free in the trap region , i.e. , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these requirements give rise to constraints on the quadrupole and hexapole tensors .",
    "to find these constraints , we note that the requirements are equivalent to requiring that @xmath19 for an electric potential @xmath20 fulfilling the laplace condition @xmath21 . for the quadrupole terms , this implies that @xmath22 must be symmetric and traceless , @xmath23 this leaves five free parameters as expected since a basis of the quadrupole field components can be formed from the five second - order spherical harmonics . for the hexapole terms , we find similarly that @xmath24 must be symmetric , and that the partial traces must vanish since @xmath25 , @xmath26 here , the symmetry requirement leaves ten independent parameters with @xmath27 , so that after the three partial trace constraints are included , seven free parameters are left as expected .",
    "we will describe the desired paths of zero field through the intersection by two curves @xmath28 , @xmath29 , parametrized by path length @xmath30 .",
    "the requirements that the curves intersect at the origin and that @xmath4 vanishes on the paths can then be expressed as    [ eq : task ] @xmath31    to establish the resulting constraints on the multipole coefficients of @xmath11 , we will expand @xmath32 in @xmath30 and look at each order in turn .",
    "we will assume that the curves have a parametrization with continuous second - order derivatives .",
    "in this case , we can require the curves to be parametrized by path length , so that @xmath33 . also , according to eq .",
    "we then have that @xmath34 where , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the tangent and normal vectors of @xmath37 at the origin , and @xmath38 is the curvature at the same point . except for the requirement that the tangent and normal vectors are perpendicular unit vectors , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath38",
    "can be chosen freely .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath39 as required by eq .   and deduce the possible value of the multipole expansion coefficients appearing in eq .  .",
    "inserting @xmath37 in the form eq .   into the expansion of @xmath4 as given by eq .  , we find that @xmath40 for @xmath32 to vanish to zeroth order in @xmath30 , we must consequently have that @xmath41 so that the homogeneous field component at the origin vanishes . continuing the expansion of @xmath42 , given that the @xmath43 fulfill eq .",
    ", we find @xmath44 it follows that for @xmath32 to vanish to first order in @xmath30 , we must require that @xmath35 is an eigenvector of @xmath22 with eigenvalue @xmath45 for @xmath29 . in the case where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are linearly independent ( the paths are not cotangential at the intersection )",
    ", it follows from the additional constraint that @xmath22 is symmetric and traceless [ eq .  ] that @xmath48 a more detailed argument , presented in the appendix , shows that the quadrupole components must vanish even in the cotangential case provided the paths are not identical . for now",
    ", we assume the dipole and quadrupole terms to vanish as required by eqs .   and , so that the expansion of @xmath42 to second order takes the form @xmath49 note that the expansion only depends on the tangent vectors @xmath35 of the curves .",
    "for algebraic simplicity , we will orient the coordinate system so that    [ eq : tdef ] @xmath50    where @xmath51 is half the angle between the tangents of the paths at the origin . without loss of generality",
    "we require @xmath52 . in this case , we find by eq .   that @xmath53 and consequently require @xmath54 for @xmath55 to vanish to second order .",
    "similarly , we find that @xmath56 s^2 + \\operatorname{\\mathcal{o}}(s^3),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] so that since by eqs .   and @xmath57 also @xmath58 and @xmath59 must vanish . taking the partial trace constraint eq .   into account",
    ", we find that the only hexapole terms that can be nonzero are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "for these terms we have , according to eqs .   and , that @xmath32 vanishes to second order in @xmath30 if and only if    [ eq : finaleq ] @xmath63    with the unique solution that @xmath64 for some constant @xmath65 . to fulfill the requirements of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dconst ] ) , ( [ eq : quadconst ] ) , and ( [ eq : coefsol ] ) , we find that the electrical potential must be of the form    @xmath66    where the basis function @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 where we have introduced the basis functions @xmath69 for later reference .    to summarize",
    ", we have constructively established that to form a zero - field intersection , @xmath11 must have vanishing dipole and quadrupole terms .",
    "furthermore , if the intersection is not cotangential , the only possible field configuration is @xmath70 .",
    "the key assumption in the arguments presented above is that the curves @xmath37 have continuous second derivatives , so that the expansion eq .",
    "( [ eq : icurvexp ] ) is valid .",
    "we assume it to be the case that all isolated lines of zero field will have this property , but even though the structure of zero - field points in free space electrostatic potentials , or equivalently critical points of harmonic functions , has been intensely studied , most results appear to pertain to 2d systems and we have not found any direct argument to support our assumption , which must consequently stand as a conjecture . on the other hand , we can say for certain that if the field vanishes on an interval of a curve with analytic parametrization , e.g. , a straight line segment , then it must vanish everywhere on the analytic continuation of that line segment .",
    "this follows from the fact that the maps @xmath71 will in this case be analytic as long as @xmath28 is in free space .",
    "this clearly rules out the possibility of ideal straight - line y or t intersections where a straight line segment with zero field would have to terminate at the intersection point .",
    "finally , we should point out that a fully confining , zero - field , right - angle intersection does exist . according to the results above , for this case @xmath72",
    "must be @xmath73 , so that the resulting intersection has a number of disadvantages compared to hexapole intersections as discussed in the beginning of this section . by brute force search in the possible octupole terms",
    "we find that @xmath74 for @xmath75 is an example of an octupole potential giving rise to an intersection with zero field on the @xmath76 and @xmath77 axes but nowhere else .",
    "for @xmath67 of eq .   for @xmath78 ( a ) and @xmath79 ( b ) .",
    "the isosurface is truncated to a cube : according to eq .",
    "the zero - field lines extend to infinity .",
    "note that there is no confinement along the @xmath80 axis for @xmath81 .",
    "since all terms of @xmath67 are third order in the coordinates , the isosurfaces of @xmath82 are related by scaling about the origin . ]    in this section we investigate the properties of the hexapole intersection described by eq .   in more detail , first with respect to confinement properties and then with respect to implementation considerations .      to study the confinement properties of @xmath83 corresponding to the hexapole field described by @xmath67 , we look for points where the corresponding field @xmath84 vanishes . in the general case",
    ", this is seen to happen along the two lines @xmath85 which are exactly the tangent lines specified in eq .  .",
    "however , for the special case of @xmath81 , @xmath86 also vanishes everywhere on the @xmath80 axis , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : isosurf ] .    to understand the transition to vanishing confinement in the @xmath80 direction , we consider the strength of the ( quartic ) confinement provided by @xmath6 along the @xmath77 and @xmath80 axes as follows : @xmath87 although confinement strength decreases monotonously with increasing @xmath51 for both axes , only the @xmath80 confinement vanishes completely .",
    "one reason that low - order intersections are interesting is that in practical implementations , it is difficult to passively ensure that all lower - order terms vanish exactly . for typical traps with nonadjustable electrode geometry and a single rf feed only the strength and frequency of the rf field",
    "can be changed once the trap is in its operational configuration .",
    "the geometry of the rf field , including the relative strength of the multipole terms at the intersection point , is not adjustable for such traps .",
    "since lower - order terms dominate at the intersection point , this could be critical to the performance of the intersection .",
    "we will consequently investigate which lower - order terms are allowed by symmetry and try to describe the perturbing effects of these on the hexapole intersection , eq .  .",
    "let us first note that the hexapole intersection potential described by @xmath88 is symmetric in @xmath76 and @xmath77 and antisymmetric in @xmath80 ,    [ eq : fullsym ] @xmath89    an analysis similar to that of sec .  [ sec : uniq - hexap - inters ] shows that these symmetry requirements alone constrain @xmath20 to be of the form @xmath90 for some constant @xmath91 . under the generous assumption that an implementation exactly obeys the symmetries , eq .",
    ", the only possible deviation from the ideal intersection given by eq .",
    "is consequently a homogeneous field in the @xmath80 direction . to empirically design a zero - field intersection under this symmetry , it is thus sufficient to ensure that the field vanishes at the intersection point , so that @xmath92 .        in realistic implementations ,",

    "if better agreement was desired , an additional fit parameter ( for example , the length of the bridge recession ) could have been included to ensure that the unwanted hexapole component @xmath122 associated with a given value of @xmath51 was made to vanish .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that a zero - field intersection for rf traps can not have any field component of quadrupole or lower order at the intersection point .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that the hexapole field component at the intersection point is uniquely determined by the intersection angle [ eq .  ] , and that this component does not provide any confinement perpendicular to the intersecting paths if these intersect at right angles .",

    "<S> we investigate the possible form of ideal intersections for two - dimensional rf trap networks suitable for quantum information processing with trapped ions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the lowest order multipole component of the rf field that can contribute to an ideal intersection is a hexapole term uniquely determined by the tangents of the intersecting paths . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding ponderomotive potential does not provide any confinement perpendicular to the paths if these intersect at right angles , indicating that ideal right - angle x - intersections are impossible to achieve with hexapole fields . based on this result </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an implementation of an ideal oblique - x intersection using a three - dimensional electrode structure .    </S>",
    "<S> intersections between network paths are a key ingredient in two - dimensional ( 2d ) rf trap networks which have been proposed to allow large scale quantum information processing ( qip ) with trapped ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rf traps confine ions by a combination of rf and quasistatic electric fields @xcite and in an ideal network the rf field and the associated ponderomotive potential vanish in the trapping zones and on dedicated paths between zones but nowhere else . </S>",
    "<S> such ideal trap networks have been demonstrated in one dimension ( 1d ) with segmented linear rf traps where transport as well as splitting and joining of groups of ions have been demonstrated to be possible with a very high degree of control @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , no ideal 2d trap networks have been identified , although a number of possible intersection geometries for 2d trap networks have been investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed shortcomings fall in two broad categories . for t @xcite , y @xcite and some x @xcite , intersections , a residual rf field </S>",
    "<S> is observed in the paths through the intersection which can possibly lead to motional heating @xcite , in addition to complicating or hindering controlled ion transport @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , some high - symmetry x geometries offer truly field - free paths but fail to be `` fully confining '' in the sense that there are unwanted lines of zero field allowing ions to escape the trap network @xcite .    in this paper we show that the unique simplest form of an ideal intersection for 2d trap networks is an oblique x and propose an implementation of this intersection based on a three - dimensional ( 3d ) electrode structure that faithfully implements the ideal intersection .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is structured as follows : sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : rf - traps ] defines the basic problem of designing ideal rf trap intersections . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : uniq - hexap - inters ] we constructively identify a hexapole term uniquely determined by the intersection angle as the only multipole term of hexapole or lower order which can contribute to a zero - field intersection . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : discussion ] we investigate the properties of the identified hexapole intersection and show that fully confining hexapole intersections are only possible at oblique intersection angles . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , in sec .  [ sec : impl - with-3d ] we describe an implementation of the ideal intersection based on a 3d electrode structure </S>"
