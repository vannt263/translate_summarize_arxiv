    "omc-2 is a star forming region embedded in the molecular filament stretching northward of the orion nebula and is one of the most luminous regions in the orion a molecular cloud .",
    "recent distance estimates place it at @xmath4 pc @xcite . as a site of star formation activity",
    ", it contains a large number of protostars and pre - main sequence stars with dusty circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "therefore , omc-2 represents a laboratory for the investigation of the detailed properties of protostars and disks which are forming in an active environment .",
    "@xcite first identified omc-2 as a complex of pre - main sequence objects associated with nearby co emission .",
    "@xcite measured the infrared luminosity of omc-2 to be 2100 @xmath1 , but did not resolve the far - ir components of irs 3 and irs 4 and thus could not provide a measurement of their individual seds .",
    "later work expanded the coverage of omc-2 to higher resolution at the longer wavelengths . @xcite",
    "conducted a millimeter study that resolved several cold ( 20 k ) dusty cores throughout omc-2/3 . in omc-2 , these cores are associated with submillimeter continuum emission @xcite .",
    "the detection of centimeter sources with the vla established many of the cores as bona fide protostars @xcite .",
    "recent studies have included high resolution , ground - based observations to further examine both the stellar component and the dusty cores @xcite .",
    "these studies revealed several stellar sources associated with the dusty cores and substructure in the cold dust of fir 4 .",
    "while previous studies include high resolution observations at 10 and 20 @xmath5 m , submillimeter , and millimeter wavelengths , there is a lack of data at high spatial resolution in the @xmath6 @xmath5 m range which is critical for constraining models of protostellar envelopes and for characterizing any external heating of both dusty disks and envelopes . during its early science phase",
    ", sofia @xcite observed the orion nebula cluster and omc-2 with the forcast mid - ir camera @xcite and detected eight intermediate - luminosity protostars and disks in omc-2 .",

    "orion molecular cloud survey @xcite , the _ herschel _ orion protostar survey ( hops ; fischer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , submillimeter data from apex , and other published data in the literature to produce complete seds of these objects from near - ir to millimeter wavelengths .",
    "finally , we compare the seds to those of model protostars and disks in order to derive the physical properties of these objects .",
    "sofia / forcast observed omc-2 during the sofia short science phase on december 1 and december 8 , 2010 , at an altitude of @xmath7 m. two pointings were used : ( @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xmath11 ) and ( @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xmath12 ) .",

    "a 5-point , @xmath18 step dither pattern was performed to reject bad pixels during post - processing .",
    "the integration time in each dither position was approximately 30 sec .",
    "the data were processed with the reduction steps described in @xcite .",
    "point source photometry was performed on sources in the images using two - dimensional gaussian fits to their radial brightness profiles .",
    "typical fwhm image quality values were @xmath19 and @xmath20 at 19.7 and 37.1 @xmath5 m , respectively . during the december 8 flight , some elongation of the psf was seen in the cross - elevation direction , resulting in image quality of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the cross - elevation and elevation direction , respectively , in the second pointing field at 31.4 @xmath5 m .",
    "photometric signal - to - noise was consistent with the mean point source sensitivity over 3 short science flights @xcite .",
    "the extracted photometric fluxes were calibrated to a flux density using a standard instrument response derived from measurements of standard stars and solar system objects over several short science and basic science flights @xcite .",
    "we applied small ( @xmath23 ) color corrections to each source , since the standard instrument response represents the response to a flat spectrum ( @xmath24 constant ) source . the estimated @xmath25 uncertainty in the calibration due to variations in flat field , water vapor burden , and altitude is approximately @xmath26 .      _",

    "[ fig : seds ] also shows that the _ spitzer_/irs spectra for sof 7 and sof 8 are in excellent agreement with the forcast data .",
    "the physical properties of the sofia - detected objects were derived using models consisting of an infalling envelope and/or a star+disk system . for the envelope , we adopted the sheet collapse models developed by hartmann , calvet & boss ( @xcite , hereafter hcb96 ) , which seem appropriate given the filamentary nature of the omc-2 molecular emission . in these models ,",
    "the envelope is flattened not only in the inner region , because of rotation , but also at large scales due to the natural elongation of the cloud .",
    "the inner region of the envelope is also partially excavated by an outflow cavity .",
    "we adopted a dust opacity law that is based on the observed class i object l1551 irs5 @xcite .",

    "the temperature distributions and seds were calculated using radiative codes developed by @xcite and by hcb96 . in some cases , external heating of the envelope was added by using a single temperature modified blackbody @xcite of temperature @xmath39 k ; this is expected in the omc-2 region which is near the orion nebula and is likely heated by the massive stars in that regions .    for the disk component of the model , we used the flared accretion disk models developed by @xcite . in these models the disk density is given by the conservation of angular momentum flux and an uniform mass accretion rate .",
    "the temperature distribution is determined from heating by viscous dissipation and stellar irradiation .",
    "the disk radius is assumed to coincide with the centrifugal radius ( which is the largest radius on the equatorial plane that receives the infalling material )",
    ". the disk models also account for dust evolution given by grain growth and settling towards the disk midplane .",
    "we assumed that the dust composition and grain - size distribution is the same as in the envelope , except in the disk midplane where a maximum grain size of 1 mm is adopted .",

    "we assume the northern component emits most of the flux at @xmath45 @xmath5 m , as evidenced by the relative flux densities at @xmath46 m , and this is the component we model .",
    "a high luminosity of 300 @xmath1 as well as some external heating is required by our model to explain the sofia flux at 37 @xmath5 m .",
    "therefore , sof 2n likely hosts an intermediate - mass protostar . a highly flattened , nearly edge - on envelope with a large opening - angle cavity is also required to reproduce the short wavelength data .",
