    "hadronic vacuum polarization effects play a key role in the prediction of many physical quantities . here",
    "we are concerned with their effect on the prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath18 , and on the running of the qed coupling to the @xmath19 boson mass .",
    "we explain below why it is crucial to predict these two quantities as precisely as possible in order to test the standard model and to probe new physics .",
    "first , we recall that the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and muon are two of the most accurately measured quantities in particle physics .",
    "indeed the anomalous moment of the electron has been measured to a few parts per billion and is found to be completely described by quantum electrodynamics .",
    "this is the most precisely tested agreement between experiment and quantum field theory . on the other hand ,",
    "since the muon is some 200 times heavier than the electron , its moment is sensitive to small - distance strong and weak interaction effects , and therefore depends on all aspects of the standard model .",
    "the world average of the existing measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is @xmath20 which is dominated by the recent value obtained by the muon @xmath5 collaboration at brookhaven national laboratory  @xcite .",
    "again , the extremely accurate measurement offers a stringent test of theory , but this time of the whole standard model .",
    "if a statistically significant deviation , no matter how tiny , can be definitively established between the measured value @xmath21 and the standard model prediction , then it will herald the existence of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "in particular the comparison offers valuable constraints on possible contributions from susy particles .",
    "the other quantity , the qed coupling at the @xmath19 boson mass , @xmath22 , is equally important .",
    "it is the least well known of the three parameters ( the fermi constant @xmath23 , @xmath22 and @xmath1 ) , which are usually taken to define the electroweak part of the standard model .",
    "its uncertainty is therefore one of the major limiting factors for precision electroweak physics .",
    "it limits , for example , the accuracy of the indirect estimate of the higgs mass in the standard model .",
    "the hadronic contributions to @xmath5 of the muon and to the running of @xmath24 can be calculated from perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) only for energies well above the heavy flavour thresholds . to calculate the important non - perturbative contributions from the low energy hadronic vacuum polarization insertions in the photon propagator we use the measured total cross section . ]",
    "@xmath25 where the 0 superscript is to indicate that we take the bare cross section with no initial state radiative or vacuum polarization corrections , but with final state radiative corrections .",
    "alternatively we may use @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "analyticity and the optical theorem then yield the dispersion relations a_^had , lo = ( ) ^2 _ s_th^s , [ eq : disprel1 ] _",
    "had(s ) = - _ s_th^s , [ eq : disprel2 ] for the hadronic contributions to @xmath18 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the superscript lo on @xmath30 denotes the leading - order hadronic contribution .",
    "there are also sizeable next - to - leading order ( nlo ) vacuum polarization and so - called `` light - by - light '' hadronic contributions to @xmath30 , which we will introduce later .",
    "the kernel @xmath31 in  ( [ eq : disprel1 ] ) is a known function ( see ( [ eq : k ] ) ) , which increases monotonically from 0.40 at @xmath32 ( the @xmath33 threshold ) to 0.63 at @xmath34 ( the @xmath35 threshold ) , and then to 1 as @xmath36 . as compared to ( [ eq : disprel2 ] ) evaluated at @xmath37 , we see that the integral in ( [ eq : disprel1 ] ) is much more dominated by contributions from the low energy domain .    at present , the accuracy to which these hadronic corrections can be calculated is the limiting factor in the precision to which @xmath5 of the muon and @xmath1 can be calculated .",
    "the hadronic corrections in turn rely on the accuracy to which @xmath38 can be determined from the experimental data , particularly in the low energy domain . for a precision analysis ,",
    "the reliance on the experimental values of @xmath38 or @xmath39 poses several problems :    * first , we must study how the data have been corrected for radiative effects .",
    "for example , to express @xmath38 in ( [ eq : disprel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : disprel2 ] ) in terms of the observed hadron production cross section , @xmath40 , we have r(s ) ( ) ^2 , [ eq : r(s)lowestorder ] if the data have not been corrected for vacuum polarization effects .",
    "the radiative correction factors , such as @xmath41 in ( [ eq : r(s)lowestorder ] ) , depend on each experiment , and we discuss them in detail in section  [ sec : clustering ] . * second , below about @xmath42 , inclusive measurements of @xmath39 are not available , and instead a sum of the measurements of exclusive processes ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) is used . * to obtain the most reliable ` experimental ' values for @xmath38 or @xmath39 we have to combine carefully , in a consistent way , data from a variety of experiments of differing precision and covering different energy intervals . in section  [ sec : clustering ] we show how this is accomplished using a clustering method which minimizes a non - linear @xmath46 function . * in the region @xmath47 where both inclusive and exclusive experimental determinations of @xmath39 have been made , there appears to be some difference in the values . in section  [ sec : qcdsumrules ] we introduce qcd sum rules explicitly designed to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "* finally , we have to decide whether to use the indirect information on @xmath48 obtained for @xmath49 , via the conserved - vector - current ( cvc ) hypothesis , from precision data for the hadronic decays of @xmath50 leptons .",
    "however , recent experiments at novosibirsk have significantly improved the accuracy of the measurements of the @xmath51 channels , and reveal a sizeable discrepancy with the cvc prediction from the @xmath50 data ; see the careful study of  @xcite . even with the re - analysed cmd-2 data the discrepancy still remains  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the understanding of the cvc hypothesis may be inadequate at the desired level of precision .",
    "it is also possible that the discrepancy is coming from the @xmath3 or @xmath50 spectral function data itself , e.g.  from some not yet understood systematic effect . and @xmath50 data is displayed in fig",
    ".  2 of @xcite . one possible origin would be an unexpectedly large mass difference between charged and neutral @xmath52 mesons , see , for example , @xcite . ]",
    "+ the experimental discrepancy may be clarified by measurements of the radiative return at @xmath53 and @xmath54 factories  @xcite . ]",
    "events , that is @xmath55 , at da@xmath56ne  @xcite and babar  @xcite . indeed the preliminary measurements of the pion form factor by the kloe collaboration @xcite compare well with the recent precise cmd-2 @xmath35 data  @xcite in the energy region above 0.7 gev , and are significantly below the values obtained , via cvc , from @xmath50 decays  @xcite .",
    "we therefore do not include the @xmath50 data in our analysis .",
    "we have previously published @xcite a short summary of our evaluation of ( [ eq : disprel1 ] ) , which gave a_^had , lo = ( 683.15.9_exp 2.0_rad ) 10 ^ -10 . [ eq : a ] when this was combined with the other contributions to @xmath5 we found that a_^sm ( g-2)/2 = ( 11659166.97.4)10 ^ -10 , [ eq : b ] in the standard model , which is about three standard deviations below the measured value given in ( [ eq : bnl2001 ] ) . the purpose of this paper is threefold .",
    "first , to describe our method of analysis in detail , and to make a careful comparison with the contemporary evaluation of ref .  @xcite .",
    "second , the recent cmd-2 data for the @xmath57 and @xmath58 channels  @xcite has just been re - analysed , and the measured values re - adjusted  @xcite .",
    "we therefore recompute @xmath59 to see how the values given in ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) are changed .",
    "third , we use our knowledge of the data for @xmath38 to give an updated determination of @xmath60 , and hence of the qed coupling @xmath1 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . as mentioned above",
    ", section  [ sec : clustering ] describes how to process and combine the data , from a wide variety of different experiments , so as to give the optimum form of @xmath38 , defined in ( [ eq : r(s ) ] ) . in section  [ sec : evaluation ] we describe how we evaluate dispersion relations ( [ eq : disprel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : disprel2 ] ) , for @xmath59 and @xmath61 respectively , and , in particular , give tables and plots to show which energy intervals give the dominant contributions _ and _ dominant uncertainties .",
    "section  [ sec : qcdsumrules ] shows how qcd sum rules may be used to resolve discrepancies between the inclusive and exclusive measurements of @xmath38 .",
    "section  [ sec : comparison ] contains a comparison with other predictions of @xmath5 , and in particular a contribution - by - contribution comparison with the very recent dehz  03 determination  @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : internal ] we calculate the _ internal_. ] hadronic light - by - light contributions to @xmath30 .",
    "section  [ sec : calculation ] describes an updated calculation of the nlo hadronic contribution , @xmath62 . in this section",
    "we give our prediction for @xmath5 of the muon .",
    "section  [ sec : determination ] is devoted to the computation of the value of the qed coupling at the @xmath19 boson mass , @xmath1 ; comparison is made with earlier determinations .",
    "we also give the implications of the updated value for the estimate of the standard model higgs boson mass .",
    "finally in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the data that are used in this analysis for @xmath38 , in order to evaluate dispersion relations ( [ eq : disprel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : disprel2 ] ) , are summarized in table  [ tab : t1 ] , for both the individual exclusive channels ( @xmath64 ) and the inclusive process ( @xmath65 ) . in sections  [ sec :",
    "vacpolcor][sec : narrowres ] we discuss the radiative corrections to the individual data sets , and then in section  [ sec : combdatasets ] we address the problem of combining different data sets for a given channel .",
    "incidentally , we need to assume that initial state radiative corrections ( which are described by pure qed ) have been properly accounted for in all experiments .",
    "we note that the interference between initial and final state radiation cancels out in the total cross section .",
    ".experiments and references for the @xmath3 data sets for the different exclusive and the inclusive channels as used in this analysis .",
    "the recent re - analysis from cmd-2 @xcite supersedes their previously published data for @xmath35 @xcite , @xmath44 @xcite and @xmath58 @xcite . [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      the value of the qed coupling on the z pole is an important ingredient in the global fit of all the precise electroweak data . the continuous curve in fig .  [ fig : c ] shows the @xmath46 profile as a function of @xmath66 obtained in the global analysis if our value of @xmath61 is used .",
    "( whereas the dashed shows the profile that would result from the bp01  @xcite determination of the qed coupling ) . the measured value of @xmath67 has been included in the analysis .",
    "when our new determination is taken , the fit predicts that a standard model higgs has a mass m_h = 102 ^_-   or @xmath68 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath69 , and the qed coupling at the @xmath19 boson mass , @xmath1 , are two important quantities in particle physics . at present , the accuracy of the theoretical predictions is limited by the uncertainty of the hadronic vacuum polarization contributions . here we use all the available data on @xmath48 to achieve the best presently possible data - driven determination of these contributions . in this way",
    ", we obtain a standard model prediction of the muon anomalous magnetic moment of a_^sm = 0.00116591763 ( 74 ) , [ eq : amm1 ] to be compared with the present experimental value of a_^exp = 0.0011659203 ( 8) , [ eq : amm2 ] which shows a @xmath70 difference . as",
    "this comparison of the measurement and prediction becomes more and more precise , we will obtain an increasingly powerful constraint on physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we have also used our optimal compilation of the available @xmath48 data to predict ( m_z^2)^-1 = 128.954 0.031 .",
    "the accuracy is now @xmath71 .",
    "this again is an important quantity .",
    "it is the most poorly - determined of the three parameters which specify the electroweak model .",
    "although significantly improved from the error of burkhardt and pietrzyk s preliminary result  @xcite , it is still the least accurately determined of the three fundamental parameters of the electroweak theory ; @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we have stressed that the comparison of the measurement and the standard model prediction of the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath18 , is very important .",
    "it provides a valuable constraint on , or an indicator of , new physics beyond the standard model . from the above discussion",
    ", we see that the present uncertainties on the measurement and the prediction are 8 and 7 @xmath74 respectively .",
    "how realistic is it to improve the accuracy in the future ? on the experimental side , the accuracy is dominated at present by the bnl measurement .",
    "we can expect a further improvement in the bnl measurement of @xmath0 , since the collaboration are at present analysing 3.7  billion @xmath75 events which should give a total relative error of about 0.8  ppm . as a consequence , the @xmath76 uncertainty in ( [ eq : amm2 ] ) should be improved to about @xmath77 . if the error on the theory prediction can be improved beyond this value then the case for another dedicated experiment with even more precision is considerably enhanced .",
    "the error attributed to the theoretical prediction of @xmath30 is dominated by the uncertainties in the computation of the hadronic contribution , @xmath78 ; in particular on the calculation of @xmath59 and @xmath79 , which at present have uncertainties of about 6 and 4 @xmath74 respectively . the latter error , on the light - by - light contribution ,",
    "is generally believed to be able to be improved to 2 @xmath74 ( 25% error ) ; and , optimistically , it is perhaps not hopeless to envisage an eventual accuracy of about 1 @xmath74 ( 10% error ) , but this would require a breakthrough in the understanding of this contribution .",
    "we are left to consider how much the error on @xmath59 could be improved .",
    "already we are claiming a 1% accuracy .",
    "to reduce the error from the present 6 @xmath80 to 1 @xmath74 is not realistic .",
    "however we should note ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) there will be progress from all experiments that are measuring @xmath81 .",
    "indeed , with the improvements , already in progress or planned , of the bes , cmd-3 + snd at vepp-2000 , babar , belle , cleo - c and kloe experiments , we may anticipate an eventual accuracy of 0.5% in the crucial @xmath52 domain and 1 - 2% in the region above 1 gev .",
    "it will be challenging , but not impossible .",
    "this statement also applies to improving the accuracy of the radiative corrections .    in this connection ,",
    "note that the measurements of the radiative return experiments are just becoming available . from these experiments",
    "we may anticipate low energy data for a variety of @xmath3 channels , produced via initial state radiation , at the @xmath53-factory da@xmath56ne @xcite and at the @xmath54-factories , babar and belle , see , for example ,  @xcite .",
    "for instance , by detecting the @xmath82 channel , it may be possible to measure the vital @xmath43 cross section in the threshold region .",
    "for the radiative return experiments there is no problem with statistics , and the accuracy is at present due to systematics , which come mainly from theory .",
    "these new experiments are motivating much theoretical work to improve their accuracy .",
    "already , today , it is claimed to be 2% in the @xmath52 region .    in summary , we may hope for an improvement in accuracy down to about 3 @xmath74 in the theoretical prediction of @xmath30 in the foreseeable future , which in turn emphasizes the need for an experimental measurement with improved precision . + * note added in proof * + the bnl muon @xmath5 collaboration have just published @xcite the results of their analysis of the @xmath75 data which updates their experimental determination of @xmath83 . as a result",
    "they now obtain a new world average @xmath84 comparing this value with our sm prediction of eq .",

    "if we neglect @xmath100-@xmath105 mixing and identify @xmath100 as @xmath127 , then the @xmath125 decay is dictated by the wzw interaction , @xmath128 which contains an extra factor of @xmath129 as compared with the @xmath130 coupling term .",
