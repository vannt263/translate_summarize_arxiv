    "periodic schrdinger operators are encountered in the modeling of the electronic structure of crystals , as well as the study of photonic crystals .",
    "they are self - adjoint operators on @xmath0 with domain @xmath1 of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the laplace operator and @xmath4 a @xmath5-periodic function of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being a periodic lattice of @xmath8 ) , with @xmath9 if @xmath10 , @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "such operators describe perfect crystals , by contrast with real crystals , in which the underlying periodic structure is perturbed by the presence of local or extended defects . in solid state physics ,",
    "local defects are due to impurities , vacancies , or interstitial atoms , while extended defects correspond to dislocations or grain boundaries .",
    "the properties of the crystal can be dramatically affected by the presence of defects . in this article",
    ", we consider the case of a @xmath15-dimensional crystal with a single local defect , whose properties are encoded in the perturbed periodic schrdinger operator @xmath16 note that we do not assume here that @xmath17 is compactly supported .",
    "this allows us in particular to handle the mean - field model considered in  @xcite . in the latter model , @xmath18 and",
    "the self - consistent potential @xmath17 generated by the defect is of the form @xmath19 with @xmath20 , @xmath21 denoting the coulomb space .",
    "such potentials are continuous and vanish at infinity , but are not compactly supported in general .    computing the spectrum of the operator @xmath22 is a key step to understand the properties of the system .",
    "it is well known that the self - adjoint operator @xmath23 is bounded from below on @xmath0 , and that the spectrum @xmath24 of @xmath23 is purely absolutely continuous , and composed of a finite or countable number of closed intervals of @xmath25  @xcite . the open interval laying between two such closed intervals",
    "is called a spectral gap .",
    "the multiplication operator @xmath17 being a compact perturbation of @xmath23 , it follows from weyl s theorem  @xcite that @xmath22 is self - adjoint on @xmath0 with domain @xmath1 , and that @xmath22 and @xmath23 have the same essential spectrum : @xmath26 contrarily to @xmath23 , which has no discrete spectrum , @xmath22 may possess discrete eigenvalues . while the discrete eigenvalues located below the minimum of @xmath27 are easily obtained by standard variational approximations ( in virtue of the rayleigh - ritz theorem  @xcite ) , it is more difficult to compute numerically the discrete eigenvalues located in spectral gaps , for spectral pollution may occur  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : spectral_pollution ] , we recall that the usual finite element galerkin approximation may give rise to spectral pollution  @xcite , and give a precise description of the corresponding spurious states . in section  [ sec : supercell ] , we show that the supercell model does not produce spectral pollution .",
    "lastly , we extend in section  [ sec : projector ] results by lewin and sr  @xcite on some no - pollution criteria , which guarantee in particular that the numerical method introduced in @xcite , involving approximate spectral projectors , and is spectral pollution free .",
    "the discrete eigenvalues of @xmath22 and the associated eigenvectors can be obtained by solving the variational problem @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the scalar product of @xmath0 and @xmath30 the bilinear form associated with @xmath22 : @xmath31 a sequence @xmath32 of finite dimensional subspaces of @xmath33 being given , we consider for all @xmath34 , the self - adjoint operator @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 the so - called galerkin method consists in approximating the spectrum of the operator @xmath22 by the eigenvalues of the discretized operators @xmath37 for @xmath38 large enough , the latter being obtained by solving the variational problem @xmath39 according to the rayleigh - ritz theorem @xcite , under the natural assumption that the sequence @xmath32 satisfies @xmath40 the galerkin method allows to compute the eigenmodes of @xmath22 associated with the discrete eigenvalues located below the bottom of the essential spectrum .",
    "it is also known ( see e.g.  @xcite for details ) that , as @xmath22 is bounded below , ( [ eq : density ] ) implies @xmath41 where the right - hand side is the limit inferior of the sets @xmath42 , that is the set of the complex numbers @xmath43 such that there exists a sequence @xmath44 , with @xmath45 for each @xmath46 , converging toward @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , any discrete eigenvalue @xmath43 of the operator @xmath22 is well - approximated by a sequence of eigenvalues of the discretized operators @xmath37 .",
    "on the other hand , ( [ eq : density ] ) is not strong enough an assumption to prevent spectral pollution .",
    "some sequences of eigenvalues of @xmath47 may indeed converge to a real number which does not belong to the spectrum of @xmath22 : @xmath48 where the limit superior of the sets @xmath42 is the set of the complex numbers @xmath43 such that there exists a subsequence @xmath49 of @xmath50 for which @xmath51    spectral pollution has been observed in many situations in physics and mechanics , and this phenomenon is now well - documented ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "boulton and levitin report numerical simulations on perturbed periodic schrdinger operators showing that `` _ the natural approach of truncating @xmath8 to a large compact domain and applying the projection method to the corresponding dirichlet problem is prone to spectral pollution _ '' . truncating",
    "@xmath8 indeed seems reasonable since it is known that the bound states of @xmath22 decay exponentially fast at infinity  @xcite .",
    "the following result provides details on the behavior of the spurious modes when the approximation space is constructed using the finite element method .",
    "[ prop : galerkin ] let @xmath52 be a sequence of uniformly regular meshes of @xmath8 , invariant with respect to the translations of the lattice @xmath5 , and such that @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 be an increasing sequence of closed convex sets of @xmath8 converging to @xmath8 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 the finite - dimensional approximation space of @xmath57 obtained with @xmath58 and @xmath59 finite elements ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "let @xmath61 and @xmath62 be such that @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "then , the sequence @xmath66 , considered as a sequence of functions of @xmath33 , converges to @xmath67 weakly in @xmath33 and strongly in @xmath68 , with @xmath69 if @xmath70 , @xmath71 if @xmath72 and @xmath73 if @xmath74 , in the sense that @xmath75 and it holds @xmath76    the latter result shows that the mass of the spurious states concentrates on the boundary of the simulation domain @xmath77 .",
    "this phenomenon is clearly observed on the two dimensional numerical simulations reported below , which have been performed with the finite element software freefem++  @xcite , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we have checked numerically , using the bloch decomposition method , that there is a gap @xmath80 , with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , between the first and second bands of @xmath83 .",

    "the spectra of @xmath37 in the gap @xmath80 for @xmath88 are displayed on fig .  1 .",
