    "recently a considerable amount of analysis has been devoted to investigating transport of brownian particles in spatially periodic stochastic structures , such as josephson junctions  @xcite , brownian motors  @xcite and molecular motors  @xcite .",
    "specifically there has been great interest in studying influences of symmetric forces on transport properties , and in calculating the effective diffusion coefficient in the overdamped limit in particular  @xcite .",
    "analytical results were obtained in arbitrary fixed periodic potential , tilted periodic potentials , symmetric periodic potentials modulated by white gaussian noise , and in supersymmetric potentials  @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of diffusion in comparison with the free diffusion was obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite . at thermal equilibrium",
    "there is not net transport of brownian particles , while away from equilibrium , the occurrence of a current ( _ ratchet effect _ ) is observed generically .",
    "therefore , the absence rather the presence of net flow of particles in spite of a broken spatial symmetry is the very surprising situation away from thermal equilibrium , as stated in refs .",
    "moreover , the problem of sorting of brownian particles by enhancement of their effective diffusion coefficient has been increasingly investigated in the last years both from experimental @xcite and theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "specifically the enhancement of diffusion in _ symmetric _ potentials was investigated in refs .",

    ", we try to understand how nonequilibrium symmetrical correlated forces influence thermal systems when potentials are symmetric , and if there are new features which characterize the relaxation process in symmetric potentials .",
    "this is done by using a fluctuating periodic potential satisfying the supersymmetry criterion @xcite , and with a different approach with respect to previous theoretical investigations ( see review of p. reimann in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using the analogy between a continuous brownian diffusion at large times and the `` jump diffusion '' model @xcite , we reduce the calculation of effective diffusion coefficient @xmath0 to the first passage time problem .",
    "we consider potentials modulated by external white gaussian noise and by markovian dichotomous noise .",
    "for the first case we derive the exact formula of @xmath0 for arbitrary potential profile .",
    "the general equations obtained for randomly switching potential are solved for the sawtooth and rectangular periodic potential , and the exact expression of @xmath0 is derived without any assumptions on the intensity of driving white gaussian noise and switchings mean rate of the potential .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient in fast fluctuating sawtooth potential was first investigated and derived in ref .",

    "@xcite we generalized this result to the case of arbitrary potential profiles .",
    "we consider the following langevin equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the displacement in time @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are statistically independent gaussian white noises with zero means and intensities @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
