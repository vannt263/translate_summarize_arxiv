    "the collisionless plasma condition applies to many astrophysical scenarios , including , the outflow from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , active galactic nuclei , and relativistic jets in general .",
    "the complexity of kinetic effects and instabilities makes it difficult to understand the nature of collisionless shocks . only recently ,",
    "the increase in available computational power has made it possible to investigate the full three - dimensional dynamics of collisionless shocks .    in the context of grb afterglows ,",
    "observations indicate that shock - compressed magnetic field from the interstellar medium ( ism ) is several orders of magnitude too weak to match observations .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations have revealed that the weibel two - stream instability is capable of generating the required electromagnetic field strength of the order of percents of equipartition value ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , pic simulations have shown that in situ non thermal particle acceleration takes place in the shock transition region @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional simulations using @xmath0 electron - positron pairs by @xcite showed how complex magnetic topologies are formed when injecting a mildly relativistic jet into a force - free magnetic field with both parallel and perpendicular components . with a two - dimensional analysis",
    ", @xcite found that an ambient parallel magnetic field can quench the two - stream instability in the weakly relativistic case . in this letter , we use three - dimensional pic experiments to investigate how the two - stream instability is affected by the presence of an ambient magnetic field .",
    "using up to @xmath1 particles and @xmath2 grid zones , we investigate the development of complex magnetic topologies when injecting a fully relativistic jet ( bulk lorentz factor @xmath3 ) into an ambient magnetized plasma . using varying field strengths , we focus on the case of a transverse magnetic field and compare it with the case of a parallel magnetic field .",
    "the simulations are mainly concerned with the electron dynamics since processes involving the heavier ions evolve on much longer timescales .",
    "we use the pic code described by @xcite .",
    "the code works from first principles and evolves the equation of motion for the particles together with maxwell s equations . in the simulation experiments , we inject an electron - proton plasma ( a jet ) into an ambient plasma ( the ism ) initially at rest ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the jet is moving with a relativistic velocity of @xmath4 along the @xmath5-direction corresponding to lorentz factor @xmath6 .",
    "the ion - to - electron mass ratio is set to @xmath7 .",
    "the jet plasma and the ambient plasma have the same density , @xmath8 , and the corresponding electron plasma rest - frame frequency @xmath9 = 0.035\\delta_t^{-1}$ ] ( @xmath10 is the unit charge , @xmath11 the vacuum permittivity , and @xmath12 the simulation unit time ) .",
    "we choose this low value in order to properly resolve the microphysics .",
    "initially , the interface between the ambient and the injected plasma is located at @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the electron skin depth defined as @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the speed of light , and @xmath17 the grid size ) .",
    "the time step and grid size obey the courant - friedrichs - levy condition @xmath18 .",
    "both plasma populations are , in their respective rest frames , maxwellian distributed with a thermal electron velocity @xmath19 .",
    "this temperature allow us to numerically resolve the plasma debye length with approximately one grid length .",
    "we consider three different ambient magnetic configurations : no magnetic field , a magnetic field parallel to the flow , and a magnetic field perpendicular to the flow .",
    "the magnetic field is initially setup to be homogeneous and at rest in the ambient plasma .",
    "the experiments are carried out with 1 billion particles inside @xmath20 grid zones . in terms of electron skin depths",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic in the direction transverse to the jet flow ( @xmath22 ) . in the parallel direction ,",
    "jet particles are continuously injected at the leftmost boundary ( @xmath23 ) . at the leftmost and rightmost @xmath5 boundary ,",
    "electromagnetic waves are absorbed , and we allow particles to escape in order to avoid unphysical feedback . the total energy throughout the simulations is conserved with an error less than @xmath24 .",
    "initially , we run simulations with no ambient magnetic field and observe the growth of the weibel two - stream instability also found in previous work ( @xcite ) .",
    "the weibel two - stream instability works when magnetic perturbations transverse to the flow collect streaming particles into current bundles that in turn amplify the magnetic perturbations . in the non linear stage ,",
    "we observe how current filaments merge into increasingly larger patterns .",
    "the electromagnetic energy grows to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 describes the amount of total injected kinetic energy that is converted to magnetic energy .      in the presence of a strong magnetic field component parallel to the flow , particles are not able to collect into bundles since transverse velocity components are deflected .",
    "we have performed five runs with parallel magnetic fields corresponding , respectively , to @xmath2740 , 20 , 10 , 5 , and 1 while keeping @xmath28 constant ; @xmath29 is the jet electron gyrofrequency .",
    "the resulting field generation efficiency can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : b_par ] at @xmath30 where the jet front has reached @xmath31 . in the case of @xmath32 ,",
    "the weibel instability overcomes the parallel field , and although initially slightly suppressed , it eventually evolves as in the case of no ambient magnetic field . increasing the magnetic field to @xmath33 effectively suppresses the instability .",
    "thus , for an ism strength magnetic field ( @xmath34 ) parallel to the plasma flow , the weibel two - stream instability will evolve unhindered , and the generated field will exceed the ism field .",
    "we find from the simulations that it would take a milligauss strength parallel magnetic field to effectively quench the instability for a @xmath35 jet expanding in an environment with density like the ism .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] show the resulting electron momentum distribution function for different values of @xmath36 at @xmath37 . since the presence of a strong parallel magnetic field suppresses the generation of a transverse magnetic field",
    ", there exists no mechanism that can heat the electrons and transfer momentum between the two electron populations .",
    "thus the jet plasma propagates unperturbed . where there is no parallel magnetic field or only a weak magnetic field ( @xmath38 )",
    ", we observe how the jet and ambient plasma is heated and how momentum is transferred between the two populations .",
    "we have performed experiments with an ambient magnetic field perpendicular to the jet flow ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) with field strengths corresponding to @xmath36=1500 , 40 , 20 and 5 . by including the displacement current",
    ", one can derive the relativistic alfvn speed @xmath39^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] is the non - relativistic counterpart .",
    "from this we calculate the corresponding relativistic alfven mach numbers @xmath41 6572 , 175 , 88 , and 22 .",
    "again , the @xmath38 run has been chosen because it resembles the typical density and microgauss magnetic field strength of the ism .",
    "we find that the magnetic field generated by the two - stream instability dominates the ambient magnetic field , and the result resembles that of no ambient magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , as expected in both the parallel and perpendicular cases , the electron momentum distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] ) are very similar , except for a weak merging between the ambient and jet electrons in the perpendicular case .    in the run with @xmath42 ,",
    "the result differs substantially from the previous cases . with reference to fig .",
    "[ fig : step1 ] , we describe the different stages of the evolution : initially , the injected particles are deflected by the ambient magnetic field . the magnetic field is piled up behind the jet front , and the enhanced magnetic fields bend jet electron trajectories sharply .",
    "this has two implications .",
    "first , the ions , being more massive , will penetrate deeper than the deflected electrons .",
    "this creates a charge separation near the jet head that effectively accelerates both ambient and injected electrons behind the ion jet front as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] .",
    "second , the deflected electrons eventually become subject to the weibel two - stream instability .",
    "this forms electron current channels at some angle to the initial direction of injection , as shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : step1 ] . around these current channels ,",
    "magnetic loops are induced ( fig .",
    "[ fig : step1 ] , region c ) . magnetic islands are formed and the ambient magnetic field is reversed behind the loops ( region b ) . in this region , we find acceleration of electrons in the @xmath43-direction .",
    "the activity in this region has similarities to reconnection , but it is beyond the scope of this letter to investigate this topic .    in other regions ,",
    "the ambient magnetic field is strongly compressed , and this amplifies the field strength up to 5 times the initial value . as a result , parts of the jet electrons are actually reversed in their direction .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] , which shows a phase - space plot of both ambient and jet electrons at @xmath44 .",
    "we see several interesting features here . in the region @xmath45 ,",
    "we observe how ambient electrons are swept up by the jet . behind the jet front ,",
    "both ambient and jet electrons are strongly accelerated since the jet ions , being heavier , take a straighter path than the jet electrons , and this creates a strong charge separation .",
    "the excess of positive charge in the very front of the jet head is very persistent and hard to shield since the jet ions are moving close to the speed of light .",
    "thus , there is a continuous transfer of @xmath5-momentum from the jet ions to the electrons . in the case of the perpendicular ambient field ,",
    "more violent processes take place than in the case of the parallel field , which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] ( _ right panel _ ) . here",
    "we see that mixing of the two plasma populations is much more effective for the perpendicular case . however , the spectrum of the electrons momentum is highly nonthermal , with strong acceleration of both jet and ambient electrons .",
    "the cutoff in electron acceleration depends on the magnetic field strength .",
    "the maxima ( @xmath46 ) at @xmath47 in fig [ fig : scatter ] corresponds to the cutoff shown by the dotted line in the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] .",
    "it should be noted that the current channels that are caused by the bent jet electron trajectories in the early time , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : step1 ] , are also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] .",
    "the first current channels have moved to around @xmath47 . at @xmath48 ,",
    "a second current channel is created by the deflected jet electrons .",
    "this periodic phenomenon involves the ions in a highly nonlinear process but is beyond the scope of this letter and will be explained in a subsequent paper .",
    "using a three - dimensional relativistic particle - in - cell code , we have investigated how an ambient magnetic field affects the dynamics of a relativistic jet in the collisionless shock region .",
    "we have examined how the different ambient magnetic topology and strength affect the growth of the electron weibel two - stream instability and the associated electron acceleration .",
    "this instability is an important mechanism in collisionless shocks .",
    "it facilitates momentum transfer between colliding plasma populations @xcite and can accelerate electrons to nonthermal distributions @xcite .",
    "collisionless shocks are found in the interface between relativistic outflows ( e.g. , from gamma - ray bursts and active galactic nuclei ) and the surrounding medium ( e.g. , the ism ) .",
    "we find substantial differences between the cases of ambient magnetic fields transverse and parallel to the jet flow .",
    "however , common for both cases is that it takes an ambient magnetic field strength much stronger than the strength of the magnetic field typically found in the ism to effectively suppress the weibel two - stream instability . in the case of a parallel magnetic field",
    ", @xmath36 must be smaller than 5 to effectively suppress the instability .",
    "this result is in good agreement with two - dimensional simulations by @xcite , and thus this limit seems independent of @xmath49 . for a typical ism density of @xmath50 ,",
    "this corresponds to a milligauss magnetic field .",
    "we emphasize the importance of @xmath36 as an important parameter for collisionless shocks , as was also pointed out by @xcite .    in the case of perpendicular injection ,",
    "the dynamics are different from the parallel injection . here , the electrons are deflected by the magnetic field , and this creates a charge separation from the less deflected ions .",
    "the charge separation drags the ambient and jet electrons , and consequently they are strongly accelerated along the @xmath5-direction .",
    "furthermore , due to the weibel instability , current channels are generated around the ambient magnetic field , which is curled and locally reversed .",
    "these simulations provide insights into the complex dynamics of relativistic jets .",
    "further investigations are required to understand the detailed physics involved .",
    "larger simulations ( above @xmath51 particles ) with longer boxes are needed to cover the instability domain of the ions , to investigate the full evolution of the complicated dynamics , and to resolve the whole shock ramp . + this research ( k .- i.n . )",
