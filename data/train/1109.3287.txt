    "supernoave type ia data @xcite as well as other observational probes @xcite show that the universe is undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion at present time , a feature that does not emerge from standard cold dark matter model @xcite .",
    "attempts to explain such unexpected behaviour go towards modifications of either the geometric part of the einstein field equations , implying modified theories of gravity , or the matter sector , thus involving new and sometimes weird forms of energy @xcite .",
    "such a dark sector seems unavoidable in order to fit present cosmological data .",
    "+ on the other hand , from the theoretical side , the strong mathematical resemblance between the dynamics of spacetime horizons and thermodynamics is strongly attested @xcite so that gravitational fields equations can be given a physical interpretation which is thermodynamical in origin . in particular , the friedmann equations follow from applying the first law to the apparent horizon of an isotropic and homogeneous universe , not only in einstein gravity , but also in more general lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "likewise , it seems that a gravitational theory built on the principle of equivalence must be thought of as a macroscopic limit of some underlying microscopic theory , the microscopic structure of spacetime manifesting itself only at planck scale or near singularities .",
    "also the horizons link some aspects of microscopic physics with the bulk dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is well known since long that one can define entropy and temperature for a spacetime horizon @xcite ; in fact , many attempts have been done to better understand this link .",
    "an instructive example is the case of spherically symmetric horizons in four dimensions , for which einstein s equations can be interpreted as a thermodynamic relation arising out of virtual displacement of the horizon @xcite .",
    "moreover , the same interpretation holds for the case of the lanczos - lovelock gravitational theory in d dimensions @xcite and explicit demonstration has been given for friedmann models @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , following this deep relation between thermodynamic and gravity , and in particular between entropy and horizons , we argue that some form of dark energy is demanded on thermodynamic grounds . + in order for an isolated system to evolve to thermodynamical equilibrium , the entropy function of the system must show two properties : it must never decrease , i.e. its first derivative with respect to the relevant variable must be non - negative , and convex , i.e. , its second derivative must be negative .",
    "+ this constitutes the hard core of the second law of thermodynamics and it is naturally realised in systems dominated by electromagnetic forces ; however it might not be true when gravity plays a role .",
    "in fact , the entropy of the system must still increase but it may be grow unbounded : this occurs , in the newtonian framework , for the antonov s sphere , the final stage of @xmath0 gravitating point masses enclosed in a perfectly reflecting , rigid , sphere whose radius exceeds some critical value @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "when we replace newtonian gravity by general relativity , a black hole is expected to be formed at the center of the sphere that , though it tends to evaporate , it will likely arrive to an equilibrium state characterised by a state of maximum , finite , entropy .",
    "+ in any case , in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology , the universe seems to behave as an ordinary system whose entropy increases towards a maximum value .",
    "the latter follows from the observational data on the evolution of the hubble factor of the frw metric @xcite and from the evolution of the entropy of the apparent horizon , that seems to be the appropriate thermodynamic boundary @xcite .",
    "the present paper is a second step of the analysis outlined above .",
    "infact , in a previous paper @xcite we showed that an einstein universe , as a thermodynamical system , can not tend to equilibrium in the last stage of expansion unless it accelerates .",
    "we have found that this holds true for some modified models that are dynamically equivalent at the background level , nevertheless this does not mean that every accelerating universe is thermodynamically motivated @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we study the thermodynamical behaviour of a braneworld model with two correction terms : a four - dimensional curvature on the brane and a gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term in the bulk @xcite . the induced gravity ( ig ) correction arises because the localized matter fields on the brane , which couple to bulk gravitons , can generate via quantum loops a localized four - dimensional world - volume kinetic term for gravitons @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a gauss - bonnet term naturally appears in an effective action approach to string theory , corresponding to the leading order quantum corrections to gravity @xcite . as a result",
    ", we have the most general action with second - order field equations in five dimensions @xcite .",
    "section [ gbig ] introduces the braneworld cosmology with induced gravity and curvature effects .",
    "subsections [ hor ] and [ mat ] focus on the entropy of the horizon and matter components , respectively .",
    "the energy componentsof the universe are assumed to enter the field equations in the form of perfect fluids , the standard equation of state being true for each of them : @xmath1 .",
    "then , in section [ chaplygin ] , the matter component is assumed as cold matter and a chaplygin gas .",
    "the choice of a chaplygin gas is based on the recent observational result that the equation of state parameter of dark energy can be less than @xmath2 and even display a transient behaviour @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved either by means of phantom fields , that on the other hand suffer from instabilities @xcite , or by other approaches that mimic this phantom - like behaviour . in the model under analysis , in which uv modifications are included by considering the stringy effect via the gb term in the bulk , and ir modifications are due to the ig effect , a chaplygin gas fluid on the brane provides a smooth crossing of the cosmological constant line @xcite .",
    "in fact , this component is characterised by a cross - over length scale below which the gas behaves as pressureless fluid and above which it mimics a cosmological constant .",
    "+ our conclusions are given in section [ conclusions ] : we find that even this modified theory of gravity needs a component with typical dark energy behaviour in order to satisfy the generalised second law ( gsl ) and approach thermodynamical equilibrium in the long run .",
    "the total action of the braneworld model under consideration reads @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the cosmological constant on the bulk and @xmath5 is the gb correction term , whose coupling constant @xmath6 is related to the string energy scale , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the gravitational coupling constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 on the brane and in the bulk , respectively introduce a length scale , the induced gravity cross - over scale , @xmath10 and help defining the brane tension , @xmath11 .",

    "this means that fluids with @xmath47 dilute as the universe expands and the temperature decreases while dark energy fields behave the opposite and the temperature will grow during the expansion ; for details see @xcite .",

    "+ by computing first and second derivatives of dust entropy inside the apparent horizon we find @xmath57 and @xmath58 now , by computing the ratio between the components as before , we obtain @xmath59 it means that if the only fluid component is dust , we need to compute explicitly the sum of the horizon and matter contribution to the entropy derivatives . by restoring proper dimensions",
