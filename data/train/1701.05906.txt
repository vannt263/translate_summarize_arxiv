    "one consequence of this observation is the detection of thermal particles in the minkowski vacuum by a uniformly accelerated observer .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the unruh effect @xcite .",
    "it has immediate consequences for quantum states observed by accelerated observers .",
    "their description becomes observer - dependent .",
    "in particular , the entanglement present in quantum states can not be assumed to be independent of the observer @xcite .    in the past ,",
    "several investigations of entanglement in uniformly accelerating systems used non - localized fock states , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . therefore , it was not clear how to obtain an operational meaning of entanglement in these states . furthermore , as pointed out in @xcite , it is questionable that these simplified models capture the consequences of acceleration correctly .",
    "another approach that is commonly used to study entanglement in the minkowski vacuum is employing accelerated unruh - dewitt detectors @xcite . in these models ,",
    "a two - level system is linearly coupled to a scalar field and the effect of finite time interactions is studied @xcite . in particular , it was shown that entanglement can be extracted from vacuum correlations @xcite .",
    "the process of extracting entanglement from the vacuum sometimes is referred to as `` entanglement harvesting '' @xcite .",
    "since these effects are typically small , a direct observation is a challenging task .",
    "however , analog systems to study these and related phenomena were proposed @xcite .",
    "another approach to localize quantum states was taken in @xcite .",
    "instead of making use of unruh - dewitt detectors , the modes constituting the state itself were constructed to be localized .",
    "that is also the approach we are following in this work .",
    "the goal of this work is to give a fully analytic treatment of the effect of acceleration on general localized fermionic gaussian states .",
    "these states are of great relevance , as the class of fermionic gaussian states contains a broad variety of states such as vacuum states of quadratic hamiltonians , thermal states and bell states .",
    "our approach is based on a method that was developed to study bosonic two - mode gaussian states of localized wave packets @xcite . similarly to the bosonic case ,",
    "we are able to formulate the transformation connecting inertial and accelerated observers as the action of a gaussian quantum channel .",
    "the framework developed in this work is then used to study the entanglement of the vacuum . in particular , we quantify the amount of entanglement that could possibly be harvested from the vacuum by local detectors and show that it increases with increasing acceleration .",
    "furthermore , we are able to obtain the entanglement in bell states , a problem that attracted a lot of attention @xcite , and show that this effect is due to an inevitable mismatch of the wave functions in minkowski and rindler spacetime .",

    "as anticipated above , we study the effect of acceleration on spatially localized fermionic modes .",
    "these modes are solutions of the equation of motion for the dirac field @xmath0 .",
    "the dirac equation is obtained by varying the action @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the determinant of the metric @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the gamma matrices , @xmath5 is the mass of the field and @xmath6 . the field can be expanded in a complete set of solutions of the dirac equation . since we are interested in modes that are sufficiently localized , we choose to expand @xmath0 in terms of localized wave - packets @xmath7 .",
    "this gives the expansion @xmath8 in minkowski space , where the @xmath9 are the creation operators for the wave - packets @xmath7 of particles / anti - particles .",

    "these modes have negligible overlap and we denote these by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "it follows that the corresponding operators commute ; @xmath24=0 $ ] .",
    "initially , these modes are prepared in a fermionic gaussian state @xmath25 that is completely characterized by its first and second moments ( covariance matrix ) . then to describe the state of the shared pair of modes from an accelerated perspective , rindler space offers a convenient reference frame .",
    "the modes in both spacetimes are related to each other by a bogolyubov transformation .",
    "hence , the gaussianity of state @xmath25 is preserved under such a transformation .",

    "the physical motivation for choosing localized cavity modes is that these modes can possibly be detected by a local detector ( in our case a cavity ) .",
    "therefore , the choice of localized modes enables us to assign an operational meaning to quantities like entanglement .",
    "furthermore , the modes ( [ inercavity ] ) and ( [ acccavity ] ) are purely positive frequency solutions .",
    "this guarantees , that the average particle and antiparticle numbers are zero in the rindler vacuum , as expected . in consequence ,",
    "the modes do necessarily have non - compact support .",

    "we also compare these findings with the case of bosons @xcite and find a qualitative agreement .",
    "furthermore , we quantified the entanglement degradation in a localized maximally entangled state of fermions .",
    "the degradation is due to an increasing mismatch between the initial modes and the accelerated modes that causes their overlap to decrease and , therefore , entanglement decreases as well .",
    "the effect of particle creation on entanglement degradation is negligible .",
    "we emphasize that due to the localization of the modes , the framework presented in this work can be applied to quantum information protocols , in scenarios where local gravitational effects or effects due to acceleration are not negligible .",
    "in particular , the entanglement can be exploited as a resource .",
    "for the future , we are interested in extending our studies to localized modes of fermions with arbitrary mutual separation , as well as studying localized gaussian states in higher dimensional spacetimes .    b.r .",
