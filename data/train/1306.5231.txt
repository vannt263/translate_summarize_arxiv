    "in cpt the lattice is seen as the periodic repetition of identical clusters ( fig .",

    "each atom is identified by the cluster it belongs to ( index @xmath7 ) and by its position inside the cluster ( index @xmath8 ) .",
    "the lattice is a collection of @xmath9 clusters each of them containing m atoms whose position is identified by the vector @xmath10+@xmath11 .",
    "each atom in the cluster is characterized by a set of orbitals @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the total number of sites / orbitals per cluster .",
    "since in the hubbard model the e - e coulomb interaction is on - site , the inter - cluster hamiltonian @xmath1 contains only single particle terms , the many body part being present in the intra - cluster hamiltonian @xmath14 only , a key feature for the practical implementation of the method . having partitioned the hamiltonian in this way an exact expression involving the resolvent operator @xmath15 is obtained @xmath16 and from this @xmath17 the one - particle propagator @xmath18 is obtained exploiting the transformation from bloch to localized basis @xmath19 and similarly for @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is a band index and @xmath22 are the eigenstate coefficients obtained by a band calculation for a superlattice of @xmath23 identical clusters and the summation is over @xmath24 .",
    "we get @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the superlattice green function , namely the fourier transform of the green function in the local basis @xmath27 this is the quantity that can be calculated by eq.[dyson ] that explicitely becomes : @xmath28 where the @xmath29 matrix @xmath30 is the fourier transform of @xmath31 involving neighboring sites that belong to different clusters .    once the cluster green function in the local basis @xmath32 has been obtained by exact diagonalization , eq .",
    "[ qc ] is solved by a @xmath29 matrix inversion at each @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the quasi particle spectrum is then obtained in terms of spectral function @xmath35 @xmath36",

    "spd _ and oxygen _ sp _ orbitals . the dimer with @xmath37 tm atoms and @xmath38 _",
    "d _ orbitals ( fig . [ steps ] a ) is the basic unit where we will perform the exact diagonalization .",

    "dotted lines indicate the inter - cluster hopping.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    we recall that the exact diagonalization corresponds to write the manybody wavefunction as a superposition of slater determinants that can be built by putting n electrons of spin up and n electrons of spin down on @xmath39 boxes : @xmath40 each mn atom brings to the dimer 5 @xmath41 electrons ( half occupation ) and the dimension of the hilbert space spanned by the slater determinants is @xmath42 .",
    "we separately solve the problem with n , n-1 and n+1 electrons and calculate the dimer green function using the lehmann representation , namely @xmath43    due to the large dimensions of the matrix to be diagonalized the band - lanczos algorithm @xcite is used to obtain @xmath44 eigenvalues and eigenvectors @xmath45 , @xmath46 for the system with @xmath47 electrons as well as the ground state @xmath48 , @xmath49 for n electron system .",
    "the dimer problem that we have described accounts for both hopping and e - e repulsion on the @xmath41 orbitals of tm atoms and therefore includes a large part of the relevant physics of the interacting system . in particular , since the system is half occupied , we expect the ground state @xmath50 to be larger than @xmath51 with an energy distance growing with @xmath52 .",
    "this is promising in view of a gap opening in the extended system .",
    "notice however that this dimer does not represent a partition ( in mathematical sense ) of the 3d rocksalt lattice and therefore it is not the cluster to be used in the cpt procedure described in the previous section .",
    "the smallest unit that has the necessary characteristics to reproduce without overlaps the 3d rocksalt lattice is the @xmath53 plaquette of fig .",
    "( [ steps ] b ) .",
    "it contains both tm atoms and oxygens and the hamiltonian @xmath54 of equation [ hubbard1 ] is a sum of on - site and inter - site terms connecting tm _ d _ orbitals ( type a ) and _ sp _ orbitals of both tm and oxygen atoms ( type b ) :    @xmath55    with @xmath56 where @xmath57 and a similar expression for @xmath58 .",
    "we need therefore to _ embed _ the dimer into the plaquette , in other words we need to write the cluster green function in terms of the dimer one .",
    "this can be done noticing again that @xmath59    that results as before in a dyson - like equation @xmath60 in the local basis @xmath61 is block - diagonal and the non - zero elements @xmath62 are obtained by performing separate exact diagonalizations that include either a or b orbitals : @xmath63 is the dimer green function of eq .",
    "[ dimer ] while @xmath64 involves only @xmath65 orbitals and in the present case is non - interacting . in the local basis",
    "[ dyson1 ] can be solved by performing a matrix inversion .",
    "@xmath66    or more explicitely    @xmath67    with indices running over @xmath68 sites / orbitals of the plaquette ( 9 @xmath69 orbitals on 2 tm atoms and 4 @xmath65 orbitals on 2 oxygens ) .",
    "we want to stress that the present formulation is nothing else than the extension of cpt to the case of more orbitals per site when it is necessary to deal with exceedingly large dimensions of the configuration space .",
    "the cpt prescriptions in this case may be rephrased as follows : chose a partition of the lattice hamiltonian into a collection of non overlapping clusters connected by inter - cluster hopping ; make a further partition inside each cluster defining a suitable collections of sites / orbitals ; perform separate exact diagonalizations plus matrix inversion to calculate the cluster green function in local basis by eq .",
    "[ inv ] and finally obtain the full lattice green function in a bloch basis by adding the cluster - cluster hopping terms according to eq .",
    "[ qc ] .    a final comment on the approximations involved : in the same way as in the standard single - orbital cpt , writing the lattice green function in terms of green functions of decoupled subunits amounts to identify the many electron states of the extended lattice as the product of cluster few electron ones . in the present case in particular , choosing the tm dimer as the basic unit we have excluded from the few - electron eigenstates obtained by exact diagonalization the contribution of oxygen @xmath70 orbitals , treating the o @xmath70 - tm @xmath41 hybridization by the embedding procedure ( eq . [ inv ] ) and by the periodization ( eq . [ qc ] )",
    ". this approximation can be improved by some kind of variational procedure but in any case it interesting to assess its validity _ per se _ , for instance by comparing theory and experiments in specific cases .",
    "this is what we do in the next section .",
    "the non interacting contribution to the hubbard hamiltonian of eq . [ hubbard1 ] can be written as a standard tight - binding hamiltonian in terms of koster - slater @xcite parameters obtained by a least squares fitting of an ab - initio band structure .",
    "the parameters obtained by fitting the band structure of mno calculated in the dft - lmto scheme @xcite are reported in tables i , ii and give rise to the band structure of fig . [ bande0 ] .",
    "when using tb parameters in the hubbard hamiltonian we must take care of the double - counting issue : ab - initio band structure , and the tb parameters deduced from it , contain the e - e coulomb repulsion as a mean - field that must be removed before including @xmath52 as a true many body term .",
    "`` bare '' on - site parameters should be calculated by subtracting the mean filed value of the hubbard term , namely @xmath72 this definition involves the @xmath41 occupation inside the cluster used in the exact diagonalization and cancels out the energy shift due to double - counting within each cluster .",
    "notice that @xmath73 and @xmath74 is spin - independent .",
    "we tested our approach using different @xmath52 values and we report the results obtained for @xmath75 .",
    "this value optimizes the agreement between theory and experiments and is not far from the values reported in the literature ranging from u=6.0 up to u=8.8 @xcite .",
    "since we have ignored the orbital dependence of @xmath52 as well as the e - e repulsion among parallel spins the present value @xmath76 should be considered as an effective one .",
    "the quasi - particle band structure of mno is shown in figure [ bandeu ] where we plot the calculated k - resolved spectral function ( eq . [ akn ] ) .",
    "we notice that the mn @xmath41 band that in the absence of correlation ( fig .",
    "[ bande0 ] ) crosses the fermi level is now split in lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "figure [ dosc ] shows a comparison between the quasiparticle density of states and the experimental results of ref .",
    "we observe that the gap value is well reproduced as well as most of the spectroscopic structures .",
    "we do not find evidence of structures below the valence band bottom that are observed in photoemission experiments ; this might be due to the reduced number of excited states that are obtained by the lanczos procedure .",
    "we mention however that the origin of satellites features in mno has been somewhat controversial in the literature attributing them either to intrinsic @xcite or extrinsic effects @xcite . a part from the satellite structure",
    "our results are comparable with what has been obtained by variational cluster approximation @xcite in spite of a different choice of the cluster , and by a recent dmft calculation @xcite .",
    "since these two approaches are either variationally optimized ( vca ) or self - consistent ( dmft ) , we may identify in our scheme the advantage of giving comparable results by a single shot calculation thanks , we believe , to our cluster choice .",
    "still we are convinced of the importance of variational optimization and our future goal will be to apply it to our cpt approach .        in conclusion , we have described a method based on a multi - orbital extension of cpt approach to include on - site interactions in the description of quasi particle states of real solid systems .",
    "the cpt strategy is applied twice , first to identify a partition of the lattice into non overlapping clusters and secondly to calculate the cluster green function in terms of two local ones .",
    "this procedure has the advantage to replace an unmanageable exact diagonalization by two separate ones followed by a matrix inversion .",
    "the non - interacting part of the lattice hamiltonian is described in terms tight - binding parameters deduced by a least - square fitting of an ab - initio single particle band structure , including all the relevant orbitals ( no minimal basis set is introduced ) . to our purposes , since we do not need any real - space expression of the single particle wavefunctions , this tight - binding parametrization is fully equivalent to a representation in terms of maximally localized wannier functions .",
    "we have applied this method to mno as a test case and using a single value of hubbard @xmath52 we have found a reasonable agreement with experimental data and with theoretical results obtained by different methods . the approach is well suited to treat local correlation in complex materials ."
