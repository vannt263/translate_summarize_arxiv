    "topology has played an increasingly important role in condensed matter physics . an early application involved using topological chern - simons theory in quantum hall systems @xcite . more recently",
    ", topological ideas applied to brillouin zone ( bz ) have played a significant role in classifying topological phases of matter ( for example , see @xcite and references therein ) . whereas the former application involved a dynamical gauge field in physical spacetime , the latter cases were formulated in the momentum space and involved topological aspects of static gauge fields such as the berry connection .",
    "it is thus natural to ask : can dynamical gauge fields naturally occur in a condensed matter system ?",
    "the aim of this paper is to argue that this can be done at least in the context of three - dimensional ( 3d ) time reversal invariant ( tri ) superconductors , where ( a slightly modified version of ) berry s gauge field can be viewed as dynamical in the brillouin zone and where the action of the theory is the chern - simons action . in this class of theories ,",
    "the fluctuations of the berry connection are induced from quantum fluctuations of the superconductor s pairing amplitude .",
    "more interestingly , 3d tri superconductors are known to be capable of having gapless nodal lines in the bz @xcite , and we will show that they play exactly the role of wilson loop observables in the chern - simons theory .    in nature , a large class of materials belongs to 3d tri superconductors , which includes most of the conventional s - wave superconductors described by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory , and a large number of unconventional superconductors such as many heavy fermion superconductors , cuprates , iron - based superconductors and the 3d topological superconductors . in particular , unconventional superconductors often exhibit a highly anisotropic pairing amplitude such as p - wave , d - wave or their hybridizations with s - wave , and have much richer phenomena in experiments @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown from different perspectives the significance of topology in these tri unconventional superconductors .",
    "gapped 3d tri superconductors are shown to have a @xmath0 topological classification @xcite , which fit in the generic k - theory classification framework of gapped topological phases @xcite .",
    "topological superconductors are defined as such superconductors with a nonzero topological number ( e.g. the @xmath1he - b phase ) , and are shown to support gapless topological majorana fermions on the surfaces @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the gapless 3d tri superconductors contain gapless nodal lines in the bz that are allowed by the time - reversal symmetry , with known examples such as the heavy fermion superconductor cept@xmath2si and the cuprates @xcite .",
    "several recent studies show that topological numbers can also be defined for these nodal - line superconductors in terms of k - theory @xcite , which give rise to various types of topological majorana surface states @xcite .",
    "in addition , in analogy to 3d weyl semimetals which can be viewed as intermediate phases between 3d topological insulators and trivial insulators @xcite , nodal - line superconductors can also arise as gapless intermediate phases between conventional tri and topological tri superconductor phases @xcite .",
    "these different while related facts strongly indicate the existence of a unified topological field theory that describes both gapped and gapless 3d tri topological superconductors .",
    "this also motivates us to consider the dynamical chern - simons theory in the 3d bz for these superconductors .",
    "there is already a hint that a topological field theory in bz can be physically relevant .",
    "in particular , it has been shown @xcite that for an insulator in odd spatial dimensions , the value of the chern - simons ( cs ) action for berry connection of the filled bands in the bz computes the effective theta angle of the corresponding @xmath3 term ( or a gravitational analog proportional to @xmath4 in the 3d case @xcite ) , where @xmath5 is the electromagnetic field in the physical spacetime .",
    "in other words , there is a coupling of the form @xmath6\\times \\left[\\int_{\\mathbb r^{2n } } f^n\\right]\\ .\\]]we will be specializing to the case of @xmath7 , i.e. , 3d space in this paper .",
    "( a similar term can be used to compute the gravitational response involving @xmath8 ) .",
    "note that the cs action , which is an angular quantity and has a shift ambiguity , has the correct structure to be the coefficient in front of @xmath9 , which needs to be defined only up to shift symmetry . in this context , it is very natural to ask whether the berry connection @xmath10 can fluctuate .",
    "in particular , we can imagine having in physical spacetime a pulse where @xmath11 , which leads to an effective level of @xmath12 for the cs theory in the bz .",
    "can the berry connection behave as if it were dynamical ? for the answer to be yes , the classical background for @xmath10 must be flat , as is demanded by the cs equations of motion .",
    "this is certainly not the case in general .",
    "however , as we shall see , it is the case for tri superconductors . with this encouraging result",
    ", one may then ask whether there are natural objects in the bz corresponding to wilson loops of the cs theory . indeed , for tri superconductors the symmetries allow gapless nodal lines in the bz , which we will see end up playing the role of wilson lines for the cs theory . for superconductors ,",
    "the relevant term to compute is the gravitational @xmath13 term .",
    "but with the gapless modes , as would be the case if we have nodal lines , the theta angle is ambiguous .",
    "it turns out the choices of resolving this ambiguity by introducing infinitesimal time reversal breaking perturbations to get rid of gapless modes are in 1 - 1 correspondence with allowed basic charges for the cs theory ! we thus find that dressing up the nodal lines with this data gives an unambiguous theta angle for the coefficient of @xmath4 term , which is identified with the free energy of cs theory in the presence of wilson loops and leads to physically measurable effects .",
    "in particular , as we shall see , when the nodal lines change from linked to unlinked , the theta angle changes in units of @xmath14 .",
    "our main discussion is in the context of the abelian chern - simons theory , but we also indicate briefly how the theory gets extended to non - abelian case , and how in particular the @xmath15 case can be potentially realized in experiments",
    ". we will also connect aspects of our discussions with topological strings @xcite which is formulated in a 6-dimensional symplectic manifold ( which is typically taken to be a calabi - yau 3-fold ) . in our context",
    ", the phase space which is @xmath16 turns out to play the role of this 6d symplectic space . in the topological string setup , cs theory lives on 3d lagrangian defects ( ` d - branes ' ) . if they are oriented along the bz @xmath17 , they give rise to the cs theory we find in the bz . in this context ,",
    "wilson loop observables arise from a pair of such 3d defects intersecting along a loop @xcite .",
    "we will show that line defects in physical space lead to such 3d lagrangian branes and can also give rise to wilson loop observables ( nodal lines ) in the bz .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the hamiltonian of tri superconductors and define the modified berry connection . in section iii , we relate the topological @xmath18 angle to a chern - simons term .",
    "section iv incorporates the nodal lines as wilson loops , first in minimal model and then in multi - band system . in section",
    "v , we consider non - abelian nodal lines , first in a @xmath15 example and then generalize to the @xmath19 example .",
    "in section vi we discuss connections with topological strings and show how line defects in physical space also lead to effective wilson loops in the bz .",
    "we present our conclusions in section vii , and in the appendix are some computational details .",
    "at the single - particle level , superconductors are described by the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian which has an inherent charge conjugation symmetry @xmath20 . for a superconductor with @xmath21 electron bands , the bdg hamiltonian can be written in terms of the nambu basis @xmath22 as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a @xmath25 matrix , @xmath26 is the momentum , and @xmath27 is the @xmath21-component electron basis of the system . both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are @xmath30 matrices .",

    "the charge conjugation symmetry of the bdg hamiltonian can be seen via the relation @xmath37 .",
    "tri superconductors are a large class of superconductors that are quite robust in nature . in the presence of time reversal symmetry",

    ", the bdg hamiltonian becomes @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "since both @xmath28 and @xmath46 are hermitian , @xmath56 is a general @xmath30 complex matrix .",
    "if @xmath56 is non - singular everywhere , the superconductor is in a fully gapped phase . on the other hand ,",

    "therefore , we reach the conclusion that @xmath79 is also flat , namely , the non - abelian field strength ( modified berry curvature ) @xmath125 at the mean field level .    unlike insulators where the berry connection @xmath80 is fixed",
    ", superconductors always have quantum fluctuations of the pairing amplitude @xmath29 around the mean - field solution , which lead to fluctuations in both @xmath80 and @xmath79 .",

    "explicitly , for the simplest @xmath81 case where @xmath79 is a u(1 ) gauge field in 3d , the fluctuation of the phase of @xmath29 breaks the time - reversal symmetry and gives rise to a @xmath127 term in the @xmath128 hamiltonian @xmath129 , which makes the berry connection @xmath79 generically non - flat .    in calculating the partition function of the tri superconductors , all the quantum fluctuations in @xmath29 around the mean - field solution should be included in the path integral .",
    "correspondingly , any fluctuations in @xmath79 induced by the pairing fluctuation should be taken into account in evaluating the @xmath18 angle . these fluctuation in @xmath79",
    "can then be naturally regarded as gaussian fluctuations in the vicinity of the flat connection which is a classical solution . since the partition function of the gravitational topological action @xmath107 generically contains contributions from topological sectors of all gravitational instanton numbers @xmath93 , the action @xmath92 in each topological sector should be regarded as a physical action . for this reason",

    "it is helpful to consider the minimal toy model with @xmath81 before dealing with the general case , though it is not quite realistic as the spin degrees of freedom ( or equivalently , @xmath39 ) requires the total number of bands @xmath21 to be even .",

    "this corresponds to strings propagating on a six dimensional symplectic manifold which is typically taken to be a calabi - yau 3-fold .",

    "we take two lagrangians to be one wrapped around @xmath371 giving us the cs theory with gauge field @xmath343 , and the other to represent the defect , given by the lagrangian @xmath372 with gauge field @xmath373 living on it .",

    "it is remarkable that phase space in 3d can naturally give a realization of topological strings !",
    "though our discussion here is based on a straight line defect in physical space , the result holds for generic smooth line defects . in the semiclassical approximation , one can define a momentum along the defect line which plays the role of @xmath327 here , and all the rest of the derivation will follow .",
    "we have seen how a modified berry s connection in the bz of a tri superconductor can behave as a dynamical gauge field in 3d with cs action whose level is given by the gravitational instanton number in the physical spacetime .",

    "whereas the linking of degenerate manifolds is also studied for the 5d weyl semimetals @xcite , it is reasonable to expect linking and knot invariants to play an important role in more generic gapless topological states of matter .",
    "the examples we have discussed exhibit mostly an abelian structure . even in the multi - band case where we got @xmath19 cs theory ,",
    "the computations reduce to @xmath374 abelian cs theory",

    "it would be very interesting to develop this connection further , for instance , to see how the gauge field @xmath354 in the lagrangian manifold @xmath345 can also be made dynamical and governed by a cs action .",
