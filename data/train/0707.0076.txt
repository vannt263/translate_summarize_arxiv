    "the trans - planckian collisions of particles attract renewed interests motivated by the scenarios of large extra dimensions @xcite . in these scenarios ,",
    "the gravity becomes higher dimensional at microscopic scale and the planck energy could be as low as tev .",
    "this indicates the possibility of the observation of quantum gravity phenomena at near - future accelerators .",
    "there are two ways to approach this subject .",
    "one is the string theory , in which one can study the regime where the string length is important but gravity is not so strong ( see @xcite for recent studies ) .",
    "since the regime of strong gravity can not be investigated by the string theory , the theory of general relativity is often used as the alternative approach . in this approach",
    ", the intermediate state is expected to be a black hole .",
    "see @xcite for outlines of the expected phenomena of tiny black holes at accelerators .    to study the process of the black hole production in general relativity , the apparent horizon ( ah ) is a very useful tool , since formation of an ah implies the existence of the event horizon outside of it . in @xcite ,",
    "the grazing collision of high - energy particles was studied using the aichelburg - sexl particle model  @xcite , and the analytic formula for the ah was obtained in the four - dimensional case .",
    "the numerical code for solving the ahs of this system in the higher - dimensional cases was developed by one of us and nambu  @xcite , and the results of @xcite were further improved by adopting a better slice  @xcite .    since the aichelburg - sexl particle is a simplified model of a particle , several efforts",
    "have been made in order to take into account the potentially important effects .",
    "the effect of electric charge was studied in @xcite , of which results were used to improve the estimate of the black hole production rate at accelerators @xcite . in @xcite , the validity of the general relativistic model was examined and the importance of wavepacket effects was pointed out . in a recent paper , the effects of the particle spin and of the wavepacket were studied in @xcite using the gyraton model @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for trials to incorporate the effects from the string theory .    in this paper , we study the collisions of high - energy extended objects in the framework of general relativity .",
    "specifically , we consider the system of two `` closed strings '' whose gravitational field is of the _ pp_-wave type .",
    "figure  [ setup ] shows the configuration of the system that we study in this paper .",
    "the two gravitational shocks collide in a @xmath0-dimensional spacetime .",
    "each shock field is generated by a ring - shaped source whose radius is @xmath1 .",
    "the positions of the two strings exactly coincide at the instant of the collision . in this setup ,",
    "formation of ahs is investigated .",
    "this study has two meanings .",
    "first , it is expected that if the length of strings is taken into account , the black hole formation in high - energy collisions becomes more difficult compared to the cases of pointlike particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by considering the collisions of extended objects",
    ", we would be able to incorporate some of effects of the strings on the black hole formation .",
    "such an approach was already done in @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the collisions of uniform disks were studied .",
    "the reason for this setup comes from the expectation that the strings behave as quasi - homogeneous beams @xcite .",
    "however , since how high - energy strings couple to gravity is still an open problem , it is meaningful to study the collisions of high - energy shocks with one - dimensional sources .",
    "furthermore , this work will clarify how the results in @xcite depend on the energy density distributions of incoming objects .",
    "next , we can provide a possible scenario of producing a black ring as a result of the gravitational collapse .",
    "the black ring @xcite is the solution of the asymptotically flat five - dimensional spacetime with the event horizon of topology @xmath4 .",
    "although the black ring solution has been found only in the five - dimensional case , there are strong indications for the existence of @xmath5-dimensional black ring solutions @xcite , whose event horizon will have the topology @xmath3 . unfortunately the black rings are expected to be unstable ( see , e.g. , sec .",
    "i of @xcite ) . however , since they would be able to exist as intermediate states of gravitational collapses , it is of interest to provide scenarios of producing ahs of topology @xmath3 ( say , black ring ahs ) .",
    "the possibility of producing black rings in collisions of two high - energy particles was discussed in @xcite . in @xcite , it was clarified that multi - particle systems can make the black ring ahs . in this paper , we demonstrate that collisions of closed strings also lead to the formation of the black ring ahs .",
    "we study both the black ring ah and the ah of topology @xmath2 ( say , black hole ah ) , and clarify the conditions for the formation of the two ahs in terms of the ring radius @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we introduce the model of a high - energy closed string and set up the collision . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the ah equation and the boundary conditions , and demonstrate existence of the black ring ah for large @xmath1 . the numerical methods for solving the two ahs are also explained . then the numerical results are shown in sec .",
    "section v is devoted to discussions on more general collisions and implications for trans - planckian collisions in the scenarios of large extra dimensions . in appendix",
    "a , formulas necessary for calculating the metrics of high - energy closed strings are presented .",
    "in this section , we introduce the model of a high - energy closed string and set up the collision .      in order to introduce the model of a high - energy closed string in a @xmath0-dimensional spacetime , we assume the following metric of the _ pp_-wave form : @xmath6 the spacetime is flat except at @xmath7",
    ". there exists a gravitational shock wave at @xmath7 , which propagates at the speed of light .",
    "the properties of the shock gravitational field is characterized by the function @xmath8 , which we call the shock potential hereafter .",
    "the nonzero component of the energy - momentum tensor of this spacetime has the form @xmath9 here , @xmath10 indicates the energy density in the shock .",
    "the einstein equation is @xmath11 with the @xmath0-dimensional gravitational constant @xmath12 and the flat space laplacian @xmath13 in the coordinates @xmath14 .",
    "the aichelburg - sexl particle @xcite has the shock potential @xmath15 here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the area of the @xmath18-dimensional unit sphere . since the energy density of this as particle is @xmath19 , the aichelburg - sexl particle represents a point particle with the energy @xmath20 .",
    "we would like to generalize the aichelburg - sexl particle to high - energy closed strings .",
    "let us introduce coordinates @xmath21 by @xmath22 with @xmath23 , and put the energy source on the @xmath24-plane in the shape of a ring with the radius @xmath1 .",

    "the results of the integration of @xmath42 for @xmath32@xmath33 are summarized in the appendix .",
    "they are given in terms of elementary functions for even @xmath0 while in terms of the complete elliptic integrals for odd @xmath0 .",
    "the above formula holds only for @xmath28 . for four dimensions ,",
    "the shock potential is @xmath43 which has the same form as that of the aichelburg - sexl particle outside of the ring .",
    "therefore , in the case @xmath44 , we can easily see what happens in the head - on collision of closed strings using the results of @xcite . the black hole ah forms if and only if @xmath45 .",
    "we also find that the black ring ah does not form for any values of @xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the theorem for the topology of ahs in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "hereafter we will consider higher dimensional cases with @xmath28 .",
    "we note that the above metrics are special cases of `` string gyratons '' proposed in @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "solutions of the gravitational field with the rank 3 antisymmetric kalb - ramon field generated by stringlike sources were obtained , and our metrics are the zero kalb - ramon charge cases of those solutions .",
    "we also note that our metric for @xmath32 coincides with the one obtained by taking the lightlike limit of the boosted black ring solution @xcite . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "i , it is expected that the black ring solutions exist also for @xmath46 .",
    "hence we conjecture that the lightlike boosts of such black ring solutions will give the above metrics after discovery of exact solutions for @xmath46 .",
    "let us examine the behavior of the shock potential @xmath47 in the neighborhood of the ring .",
    "for this purpose , we introduce new coordinates @xmath48 by @xmath49 these coordinates are also useful for studying the black ring ah . in these coordinates ,",
    "the ring is located at @xmath50 . in the regime @xmath51",
    ", the shock potential behaves as @xmath52 with @xmath53 these formulas will be used later to show the existence of the black ring ah in the case @xmath54 .      because the delta function in the metric indicates the discontinuity of the coordinates @xmath55 at @xmath7 , it is necessary to introduce the continuous and smooth coordinates @xmath56 in order to set up the collision .",
    "such a coordinate transformation is given in @xcite as @xmath57 here , @xmath58 denotes the heaviside step function . in these coordinates ,",
    "the line @xmath59 is the null geodesic and @xmath60 is its affine parameter .",
    "the metric is written as @xmath61 @xmath62      now we set up the collision of two high - energy closed strings .",
    "figure [ collision ] shows the schematic picture of the spacetime structure .",
    "the spacetime is divided into regions i : @xmath63 , ii : @xmath64 , iii : @xmath65 , and iv : @xmath66 .",
    "because the strings propagate at the speed of light , they do not interact before the collision .",
    "therefore we can write down the metric in regions i , ii , and iii just by combining the two metrics : @xmath67dx^idx^j\\ ] ] @xmath68 since we use the same formula of the shock potential for two incoming strings , their positions exactly coincide at the instant of the collision .",
    "region iv is the interaction region and its spacetime structure is not known .",
    "however , it is still possible to confirm the black hole formation by studying an ah on some slice in regions i , ii , and iii . in the next section ,",
    "we explain how to find the ahs on the slice @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ collision ] ) .",
    "in this section , we show the equations and the boundary conditions for the black hole ah and the black ring ah on the slice @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "these ah equations can be solved analytically in the two cases @xmath71 and @xmath54 .",
    "then , the numerical methods for solving the two ahs are presented .",
    "the ah is defined as a @xmath72-dimensional surface whose outgoing null geodesic congruence has zero expansion .",
    "let the ah be given by the union of two surfaces @xmath73 : @xmath74 in @xmath70 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 in @xmath69 . here",
    ", the surfaces @xmath77 are connected on a common boundary @xmath78 in @xmath79 . the equation and",
    "the boundary conditions for @xmath80 were derived in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "here we just comment on the results .",
    "the ah equation is found as @xmath81 , by imposing the expansion of the null geodesic congruence of each surface to be zero .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath82 and @xmath83 on @xmath78 , which come from the continuity of the surface and the null tangent vectors , respectively .",
    "there are two boundary conditions because the boundary @xmath78 itself is an unknown surface to be solved .",
    "let us consider the black hole ah in the case @xmath71 . in this case",
    ", the system is reduced to the head - on collision of aichelburg - sexl particles . using the spherical - polar coordinates",

    ", we can show the existence of the black ring ah as follows .",
    "in the neighborhood of the ring , the shock potential @xmath47 is approximated as eq .  .",

    "it is reminded that the above approximation is valid only for @xmath54 .",
    "since we have the solution of the black hole ah for @xmath71 , we can numerically solve it for @xmath103 by slowly increasing the value of @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , since the solution of the black ring ah is known for @xmath54 , the numerical calculation can be done by starting at sufficiently large @xmath1 and gradually decreasing the value of @xmath1 . in the following ,",

    "several momentarily static initial data sets in five - dimensional spacetimes were investigated .",
    "one of the studied system is ring - shaped matter distribution , for which the black hole ah and the black ring ah form for small and large values of the ring radius , respectively .",
    "their interpretation is that for large ring radius , the gravitational field in the transverse direction of the ring is four dimensional , and thus the black ring ah can form .",
    "we consider that the same argument holds for our system , since the behavior of the shock potential in the transverse direction of the @xmath0-dimensional string is similar to that of the @xmath175-dimensional aichelburg - sexl particle , as found by comparing eqs .   and .",
    "in this paper , we studied the collision of high - energy closed strings .",
    "the positions of two closed strings were assumed to coincide at the instant of the collision . in this setup , we found that the black hole ah forms for small ring radius @xmath1 and the black ring ah forms for large ring radius @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the collision of high - energy closed strings with large radius will lead to the formation of the black ring .    because the setup of the collision in this paper is quite limited ,",
    "let us discuss what happens in a more general setup . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that the radii of two strings be the same . in general collisions , we have to take account of the impact parameter @xmath176 . here",

    "let us first discuss the black hole ah . in the head - on collision @xmath177",
    ", it is expected that the main factor for the ah formation is the ring radius , because the discussion in sec .",

    "as the impact parameter @xmath176 is increased , @xmath180 will become small and eventually go to zero .",
    "this happens at @xmath181 , since in the aichelburg - sexl particle case ( @xmath71 ) , the maximal impact parameter for the ah formation is @xmath182 as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the condition for the black hole formation will be given by @xmath183 .",
    "this is the same criterion as the one discussed in @xcite .",
    "next we discuss the black ring ah . the condition for the formation of the black ring ah will strongly depend on the angles @xmath179 even in the head - on collision cases @xmath177 , since the distance between the two strings should be less than @xmath102 .",
    "namely , in the five - dimensional case , the angle @xmath139 should satisfy @xmath184 . similarly , in the @xmath0-dimensional case , all the angles @xmath179 should satisfy @xmath185 . therefore , even in the head - on collision cases , the black ring formation is quite difficult .",
    "if we can not control the orientations of the incoming strings , the black ring will form only with the probability @xmath186 . furthermore",
    ", the impact parameter should be smaller than the the radius of the @xmath145 sphere of @xmath90 , i.e. @xmath187 , which is much smaller than @xmath34 .",

    "would be expected instead , with the probability discussed above .",
    "however , we point out here that an additional condition is required for the production of a classical black ring .",
    "because the black ring can be a classical object only when the radius of the @xmath145 sphere of @xmath89 is larger than the planck length @xmath191 , the system should satisfy @xmath192 .",
