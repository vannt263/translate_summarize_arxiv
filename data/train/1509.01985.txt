    "<S> common density - matrix functionals , the mller and the power functional , have been benchmarked for the half - filled hubbard dimer , which allows to model the bond dissociation problem and the transition from the weakly to the strongly correlated limit . </S>",
    "<S> unbiased numerical calculations are combined with analytical results . despite the well known successes of the mller functional , the ground state is degenerate with a one - dimensional manifold of ferromagnetic solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting infinite magnetic susceptibility indicates another qualitative flaw of the mller functional . </S>",
    "<S> the derivative discontinuity with respect to particle number is not present indicating an incorrect metal - like behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the power functional actually favors the ferromagnetic state for weak interaction . </S>",
    "<S> analogous to the hartree - fock approximation , the power functional undergoes a transition beyond a critical interaction strength , in this case however , to a non - collinear antiferromagnetic state . </S>"
