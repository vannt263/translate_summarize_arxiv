    "for a reductive algebraic group over @xmath2 split over @xmath3 with fixed choice of chevalley generators in the lie algebra , there is a well defined notion of positive , or @xmath4-valued , points due to lusztig @xcite . in the case of @xmath5 with the standard choices the resulting `` @xmath6 '' recovers the classical notion of totally positive matrices , that is matrices all of whose minors are in @xmath7 . for general @xmath8 the set @xmath9 , or @xmath10 as we will denote it ,",
    "is therefore called the totally positive part of @xmath8 .",
    "the closure @xmath11 of @xmath10 ( in the real topology ) is called the totally nonnegative part of @xmath8 .",
    "these notions extend in a natural way to flag varieties @xmath0 , @xcite .",
    "that is , one has a notion of @xmath12  this is a semi - algebraic subset of the real points in @xmath0  and of @xmath1 , the closure of @xmath12 .",

    "defined an analogous decomposition of @xmath0 into smooth strata @xmath17 .",
    "these decompositions intersected with the @xmath1 give cell decompositions of the totally nonnegative parts of the @xmath0 , @xcite .",
    "we call the components of this decomposition of @xmath1 the totally nonnegative cells in @xmath0 .",
    "note that there is one open totally nonnegative cell in @xmath0 , namely @xmath12 itself .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that @xmath18 is contractible , and the same holds for @xmath1 by the same proof .",
    "also fomin and shapiro @xcite studied links of totally nonnegative cells inside a big cell of @xmath19 , in particular showing them to be contractible . beyond these special cases ,",
    "however , not much is known about the closures of the individual cells or how the cells are glued together .    in this paper",
    "we prove that the closure of a totally nonnegative cell is a union of totally nonnegative cells and describe the closure relations in terms of the weyl group . in the full flag variety case",
    "we show that @xmath20 , whenever @xmath21 , see theorem  [ t : b ] .",
    "this theorem is then generalized to @xmath0 ( see theorem  [ t : p ] ) , with the combinatorial description of the cells and their closure relations given in section  [ s : p ] .",
    "@xmath22    [ f : sl3 ]    a main difficulty in proving such results lies in how to find a totally nonnegative cell @xmath23 inside the closure of another .",
    "while much detailed information is available about the individual cells , such as parameterizations , explicit defining equalities / inequalities ( see @xcite ) , none of these results readily extend to the closures of the cells .",
    "the central idea which allows us to relate this problem to an easier special case is contained in lemma  4.3 .",
    "the combinatorial properties of our poset describing the closure relations between totally nonnegative cells were recently investigated by williams @xcite .",
    "her results suggest , and she conjectures , that @xmath1 is a regular cw complex homeomorphic to a closed ball . for an illustration of the totally nonnegative part with its cell decomposition in the case of @xmath24 see figure  [ f : sl3 ] .    in the last section",

    "@xmath0 is either taken again over @xmath3 , or over an algebraically closed field @xmath25 ( and zariski topology ) .",
    "the closure relations among the totally nonnegative cells could in retrospect be viewed as an @xmath7-valued analogue of proposition  [ p : p ] , although the results involving positivity are more difficult to prove .",
    "lusztig s stratification of @xmath0 ( over @xmath2 ) has recently been reinterpreted by goodearl and yakimov @xcite in a poisson geometric setting .",
    "namely the strata arise as torus - orbits of symplectic leaves for a certain natural poisson structure on @xmath0 .",
    "this paper also independently gives closure relations among these strata ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.8 ) which look quite different from our proposition  [ p : p ] .",
