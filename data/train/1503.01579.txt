    "einstein s theory of gravity , based on general relativity , is known to possess many successes but also many open questions . in the context of cosmology ,",
    "the `` old problems '' of flatness , horizon , monopoles and density perturbations were solved by the introduction of inflation , a very fast expanding , early phase in the history of our universe @xcite .",
    "new questions have however emerged , such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy or the coincidence problem , which are still persisting despite all the efforts .",
    "searching for alternative and maybe more fundamental theories of gravity , that would allow for new directions of thinking and for novel solutions , has been a path followed by many scientists .",
    "looking at higher dimensions for inspiration , the lovelock theory @xcite emerges as a natural higher - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) generalization : its action is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath1 of riemann curvature , with einstein s term @xmath2 arising for @xmath3 , the quadratic gauss - bonnet term @xmath4 for @xmath5 , and so on .",
    "the most remarkable and distinguishing basic feature of the theory is that the ensuing field equations are of second order as in einstein s gravity , a requirement necessary to ward off undesirable features like ghosts .",
    "our primary candidate for a generalised gravitational theory in four dimensions is the one given by the heterotic superstring effective action @xcite , where the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term appears as an @xmath6-order correction .",
    "in addition , this term is the highest , non - zero one in the lovelock polynomial in @xmath7  in @xmath8 dimensions , only the terms with @xmath9 are non - trivial @xcite . but being a topological invariant in 4-dimensions , the gb term , in the context of any theory , should always be coupled to a scalar field to get a non - trivial contribution to the field equations .",
    "the presence of the gb term in the string effective theory , or in more generalised string - inspired ones , has been shown to lead to novel solutions such as singularity - free cosmological solutions @xcite , hairy black holes @xcite or even traversable wormholes @xcite .    in all cases ,",
    "the gb term was shown to be the dominant agent that allowed for the existence of these solutions .",
    "motivated by this , here we consider an einstein - scalar - gb theory with a polynomial coupling function between the scalar field and the gb term .",
    "we focus our analysis on the early - time evolution of the universe and argue that the ricci scalar is again sub - dominant to the gb term , and thus it can be ignored .",
    "we then demonstrate that analytical , elegant , inflationary solutions with attractive characteristics  compared to the existing models  are naturally supported by the field equations .",
    "we consider the following gravitational theory of a scalar field @xmath10 @xmath11,\\label{act}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] coupled non - minimally to gravity via the gauss - bonnet term @xmath12 by a general coupling function @xmath13 .",
    "the variation of the action ( [ act ] ) with respect to the metric tensor and scalar field leads to the field equations r_-g_r + p_^f = _ _ - g _ , _ + f r^2_gb=0 , [ dilaton - eq - cov ] where @xmath14 , the constant @xmath15 has been set to unity , and @xmath16 is defined as p_=r_+2g_+ 2g_+rg_. we assume that the line - element has the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker form ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t ) , [ metric ] with @xmath17 denoting the curvature of the 3-dimensional space .",
    "then , the field equations take the explicit form @xmath18 2(1+h\\dot f ) ( h^2+\\dot h ) \\hspace*{1.5 cm } & & \\nonumber \\\\   + ( 1+\\ddot f ) \\bigl(h^2 + \\frac{k}{a^2}\\bigr)&=&-\\frac{\\dot \\phi^2}{2}\\ , , \\label{ein-2}\\\\[1 mm ] \\ddot \\phi+3 h \\dot \\phi-3f ' \\bigl(h^2+\\frac{k}{a^2}\\bigr ) ( h^2+\\dot h)&=&0\\ , , \\label{dilaton - eq-0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the hubble parameter and the dot denotes a derivative with respect to time . in this work",
    ", we will consider a polynomial coupling function , i.e. @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a constant and @xmath22 an integer .",
    "the case with @xmath23 is equivalent to ignoring the gb term ; the cases with @xmath24 and @xmath25 will be studied in sections iii and iv , respectively .",
    "in this section , we will formulate an analytical argument to demonstrate that , in the strong - gravity regime , the presence of the ricci scalar significantly complicates the derivation of a cosmological solution without adding any important effect to its dynamics . here",
    ", we will consider the case of @xmath24 , for which the scalar equation ( [ dilaton - eq-0 ] ) can be integrated once to yield the relation = + , [ rel - phi - r ] with @xmath26 an integration constant .",
    "the second term in the above relation is clearly the one associated to the gb term , and we will focus on this , setting @xmath27 .    combining eqs .",
    "( [ ein-1])-([dilaton - eq-0 ] ) and using that @xmath28 , we obtain the constraint & & 4(h^2 + ) + 2(h^2 + h)(1+h ) + & & + 3 ^ 2(h^2 + h ) ( h^2 + ) ^2=0 .",
    "[ eq1and2-r-1 ] if we substitute @xmath29 via eq .",
    "( [ rel - phi - r ] ) , the above equation has no dependence on the scalar field .",
    "after some algebra , it can be integrated once to give 3a^4=-^2 ( + + ) + c_1 , [ adot - linear ] with @xmath30 an integration constant again . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the above can not be easily solved for @xmath32 . however , for a flat universe ( @xmath33 ) , we easily find that a ^4=(1- ) . the solution of the above equation can be written in the non - explicit form a(t)f= ( ) ^1/4(t+t_0 ) , where @xmath34 is the hypergeometric function . the above describes an increasing scale factor with time that is however bounded from above due to the convergence criterion @xmath35 of @xmath36 . in the limit @xmath37 , i.e. in the strong - gravity limit , the relation between the scale factor and the time coordinate becomes linear with a big - bang singularity emerging at a finite value of time .",
    "let us now focus on the strong - gravity regime from the beginning and assume that , in that limit , the ricci scalar @xmath2 will be subdominant to the gb term . in this case",
    ", the scalar equation ( [ dilaton - eq-0 ] ) remains the same , while the two gravitational equations will be modified by loosing all unity terms appearing inside brackets on their left - hand - sides .",
    "then , eq . ( [ ein-1 ] ) can be solved for @xmath38 , even for a general coupling function @xmath13 , to give = 6fh ( h^2 + ) .",
    "[ phi - dot ] following a similar analysis as above , i.e. combining eqs .",
    "( [ ein-1])-([dilaton - eq-0 ] ) , employing eq .",
    "( [ phi - dot ] ) and the fact that @xmath39 , we now arrive at the simpler constraint ( 5h^2+)(h^2+h ) = 0 .",
    "[ eq1and2-v1 ] the general solution of the above differential equation is : @xmath40 , describing a linearly - expanding universe at early times .",
    "this is in full agreement with the result obtained above in the context of the full analysis and in the early - time limit . by plotting the two solutions @xcite",
    ", one may easily see that these perfectly match at early times , while a deviation begins to appear , for a given @xmath21 , the sooner the larger the value of the integration constant @xmath30 is .",
    "a similar conclusion may be reached for the behaviour of the scalar field : using either eq .",
    "( [ rel - phi - r ] ) or ( [ phi - dot ] ) and taking the limit of early times , we obtain @xmath41 with a divergence appearing at the initial singularity .",
    "in this section , we will proceed to study the case of a quadratic coupling function , @xmath42 . unfortunately , in this case , the set of equations is significantly more complicated and the formulation of a similar analytic argument regarding the role of the ricci scalar is impossible .",
    "however , since the coupling function determines the weight of the gb term in the theory , we expect that its exact form merely determines the point in time where the gb term begins to dominate over the ricci scalar in the early - time , strong - gravity regime .",
    "thus , here we will ignore again the ricci scalar and focus on an appropriately chosen early - time period .",
    "equation ( [ phi - dot ] ) still holds , however , the different form of the coupling function modifies the constraint ( [ eq1and2-v1 ] ) as follows ( 5 h^2+)(h^2+h ) + 24 h^2 ( h^2+)^2=0 . [ constraint ] the above differential equation involves only the scale factor @xmath43 , however it is only for @xmath33 that it can be integrated twice to yield an explicit solution  for @xmath31 , a transcendental equation arises after the first integration @xcite .",
    "thus , for a flat space , we have h+h^2(1-)=0 , [ cons - k0 ] where we have defined @xmath44 .",
    "the above implies that a de sitter solution , with @xmath45 a constant and thus @xmath46 , exists when @xmath47 describing an inflationary phase .",
    "the corresponding accelerating solution with @xmath44 is a repeller , while the second solution @xmath48 , describing a minkowski spacetime , is an attractor .",
    "therefore , in order to have a natural exit from the inflationary phase we have to consider an initial condition ( @xmath49 ) such that @xmath50 . note that if we consider @xmath51 , the universe will be eternally inflating @xmath52 . integrating eq .",
    "( [ cons - k0 ] ) once , we obtain h= , [ general ] where @xmath53 is an arbitrary integration constant . depending on the values of the two parameters @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath53 , the above equation results to different types of cosmological solutions .",
    "the existence of de sitter implies @xmath47 and the natural exit implies @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "here , we will present only these two cases that support a non - eternal inflationary phase of expansion for the universe - for a more comprehensive analysis , please refer to @xcite .      if @xmath56 , then integrating once more eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) , we find a(t)=a_0(t ) .",
    "[ sol - c10 ] the profile of the scale factor is shown in fig .",
    "1 . we observe that the smaller the value of the coupling constant @xmath57 is , the faster @xmath43 evolves with time .",
    "the above solution may be considered as an alternative to the usual inflationary solutions following from the einstein - hilbert action which require an appropriate potential for the scalar field  here , it is the gb term itself that provides the necessary potential .",
    "the solution for the scalar field can be found via eq .",
    "( [ phi - dot ] ) : for @xmath33 and @xmath58 , it can readily be integrated to give the solution ( t)=_0(-t ) .",
    "[ solphi - c10 ] the above describes a regular , exponentially decaying scalar field .",
    "one may easily verify that the combination of solutions ( [ sol - c10 ] ) and ( [ solphi - c10 ] ) satisfies the complete set of field equations .",
    "the scalar field starts from an arbitrary value @xmath59 and quickly reduces to zero  again , the smaller the value of @xmath57 is , the faster it decays . as a result ,",
    "the coupling function @xmath60 remains always bounded .",
    "the effective potential of the scalar field receives contributions from both the gb term and the coupling function and has the explicit form v_eff -f ( ) r^2_gb= .",
    "[ veff ] therefore , @xmath61 also remains bounded as the field evolves ; at the same time , it may become arbitrarily large at early times by appropriately choosing the value of the coupling constant @xmath21 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the behavior seen in more traditional inflationary models , such as the chaotic @xcite , where the effective potential blows up for the super - planckian initial values of the field unless a fine - tuning is imposed on the parameters of the model  as we will see in sec .",
    "iv , such an unnatural initial value is not needed in our case for the necessary number of e - foldings to be obtained .",
    "it is also a significant improvement compared to models for inflation @xcite where the scalar potential remains bounded but its value is too small to justify its dominance over any other distribution of matter in the universe and thus allow inflation to be realised .",
    "we will now demonstrate that the pure de sitter solution of the previous case is the early - time limit of a more interesting class of cosmological solutions that follow when @xmath47 and @xmath53 positive . in this case , by using the change of variable @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , eq . ( [ general ] ) can be again integrated to yield + ( ) = ( t+t_0 ) .",
    "[ sol - lam - neg ] plotting the above ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , the scale factor is found to be an increasing function of time . in the limit @xmath37 , i.e. at early times , eq .",
    "( [ sol - lam - neg ] ) reduces to the pure de sitter solution ( [ sol - c10 ] ) ; on the other hand , expanding ( [ sol - lam - neg ] ) for @xmath65 , we obtain a linear dependence of the scale factor on time , @xmath66 . thus , in this case the universe naturally interpolates between a de sitter phase at early times and a milne phase at later times .    in order to find the solution for @xmath10 , we observe that , for @xmath60 , it holds that @xmath67 .",
    "then , using eq .",
    "( [ phi - dot ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) and integrating once , we obtain the relation @xmath68 . then , the following implicit expression may be derived for the scalar field ^2=c_0()^5/2 .",
    "for early times , @xmath10 is again decreasing exponentially while , at later times , it reduces to a constant .",
    "its effective potential is also decreasing , exponentially at early times and as @xmath69 at later times , remaining again bounded .",
    "however , we expect that the late - time behaviour of both the scale factor and the scalar field will start to deviate from the above expressions due to the increasing role of the ricci scalar as the universe expands and to the contribution of radiation / matter .",
    "only a numerical analysis of the full model could reveal the duration of the milne phase and its implications for late cosmology as well as the fate of the scalar field .",
    "the early de sitter phase should have a long - enough duration in order to resolve the problems of the standard cosmology . using the form ( [ general ] )",
    ", we demand the initial condition to satisfy @xmath70 which implies @xmath71 , where @xmath1 is the number of e - foldings @xmath72 . according to this , the smaller the value of @xmath53 , the longer the acceleration ; this was expected since for @xmath56 , the acceleration is eternal .",
    "therefore the number of e - foldings during inflation depends on the initial condition @xmath49 .",
    "we may finally define the slow - roll parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 as follows @xmath75 during inflation , the odd slow - roll parameters approach zero , @xmath76 , while the even parameters are of order unity , @xmath77 .",
    "the slow - roll approximation is thus violated . a very similar behavior exists in the so called ultra - slow roll inflation @xcite ( also known as fast - roll inflation @xcite ) .    at later times , the slow - roll parameters move away from the above values to mark the end of inflation . in fig .",
    "[ slow - roll ] , we depict the evolution of @xmath78 , for different initial conditions : inflation is realized at early times , when @xmath79 , and a natural exit takes place at later times as @xmath78 moves to values closer to unity .",
    "let us finally note that the cases of a general polynomial coupling function , i.e. with @xmath80 and @xmath22 an arbitrary integer , as well as that of an exponential coupling function , i.e. with @xmath81 and @xmath82 an arbitrary number , were also studied @xcite . in the first case",
    ", it was demonstrated that de sitter - type solutions , either as exact or limiting solutions , arise only for the case of @xmath25 . in the latter case",
    ", it was shown that a scalar - gb theory with an exponential coupling function admits , at early times , only slowly expanding solutions of the form @xmath83",
    ". therefore , the particular model apparently singles out the quadratic coupling function as the unique choice that allows for the emergence of inflationary solutions or solutions with additional attractive characteristics from the cosmological point of view @xcite .",
    "we have considered an einstein - scalar - gb gravitational theory , and developed an analytical argument to show that the ricci scalar can be safely ignored when we focus on early times .",
    "note that in the high energy regime of the early universe , higher - order curvature terms would naturally be the most pertinent . here , we have considered only those terms inspired by the lovelock expansion , that lead to second - order differential equations , a necessary condition to ward off ghost fields from the theory .",
    "as the higher lovelock polynomials , with @xmath84 , are trivial in four dimensions , even if coupled to a scalar field ( since the lovelock lagrangian vanishes , @xmath85 , for @xmath86 ) , it is only the gb term that could have a non - trivial contribution , through a scalar field coupling , on the @xmath87-dimensional dynamics .",
    "we have demonstrated that a pure scalar - gb theory naturally supports de sitter solutions with a natural exit mechanism to a linearly expanding ",
    "phase . the quadratic coupling function , although a special choice , is in fact the only one that allows for inflationary , de sitter - type solutions to emerge @xcite ; in addition , it shares several features with the one emerging in the context of the heterotic superstring effective action and was shown in the past to support similar type of singularity - free cosmological solutions @xcite .",
    "our simplifying approach leads to analytical , elegant inflationary solutions with a bounded potential and free of fine - tunings .",
    "important questions that still need to be answered are how , and at which point in time , the ricci scalar and the presence of additional matter affect the dynamics of the model  for this , a more involved numerical analysis is clearly necessary . also , one should investigate whether this type of inflation gives a perturbation spectrum in accordance to observations .",
    "note , however , that all the aforementioned questions will be relevant not only to our model but to any string - inspired or generalised gravitational theory that contains the ricci scalar and gb term .",
    "we plan to report on these questions in a future work .",
