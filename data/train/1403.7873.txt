    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) were discovered in recent years @xcite . a burst rate of about ten thousand bursts per day over the entire sky",
    "was deduced @xcite .",
    "however , it is still not possible to determine the astrophysical origins and the redshift distribution of frbs , because no optical counterpart has been discovered yet and hence no redshift of frbs has been measured . in this paper",
    "we propose that strong gravitational lensing ( sgl ) of frbs by dark matter halos in foreground galaxies may have a critical role in the study of frb progenitors .",
    "radio surveys for frbs suffer from the restriction in angular resolutions , which makes it difficult to identify the respective optical counterparts .",
    "but for transient sources like frbs , the sgl properties may be used for identifying the progenitor of frbs .",
    "different frb progenitor models result in different frb redshift distributions , and hence different frb lensing probabilities , that is , different expected sample size for producing one lensing case .    due to the transient nature of frbs and the time - delay between images in gravitational lensing ,",
    "it is possible to identify lensing events of frbs in a radio survey despite the restriction of angular resolution .",
    "the standard way for identifying gravitational lensing images is based on two criteria : ( 1 ) their light curves have identical shapes and identical durations ; ( 2 ) their spectra have the same shape .",
    "the second criteria is critical , because the first criteria is relatively easy to check .",
    "if a radio telescope has several frequency channels , then the ratio between fluxes in any two channels can be used to judge if the radio spectra of the two frb images have the same shape . a similar dispersion measure ( dm )",
    "may be another criteria to justify a lensing case .",
    "the statistical lensing probability obtained from a long period frb survey for multiple lensing images may be used to constrain the associated distribution profile in the frb redshift space .",
    "in addition , if a frb strong lensing event is confirmed in a well - studied lens system , the redshift of the frb may be inferred .",
    "we calculate the probability for gravitational lensing of frbs by the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) dark matter halos in foreground galaxies , assuming that the mass function of the halos is given by the press - schechter function and the universe is described by the standard lcdm model .",
    "later , we build four types of frb models , each corresponding to a frb progenitor model with different redshift distributions .",
    "lastly , we calculate the expected frb sample size for producing one lensing case and compare the results for different frb models .",
    "herein we present the statistics and properties for a remote source gravitationally lensed by dark matter halos in foreground galaxies .",
    "we assume that all halos have a sis mass profile in the mass range @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "this mass range roughly corresponds to dark matter halos residing in galaxies .",
    "halos with masses out of this range often have a nfw - type mass profile @xcite and make only small contribution to the total lensing probability @xcite .    as in @xcite , we assume that the number density of dark matter halos distributed in mass is described by the press - schechter function @xcite .",
    "we compute the cdm power spectrum using the fitting formula provided by @xcite . to be consistent with the recent observations of _",
    "@xcite , we assume that the hubble constant @xmath3 , the primordial spectrum index @xmath4 , the cosmological constant fraction @xmath5 , and the standard deviation for the primordial density fluctuation @xmath6 .    according to the theory of gravitational lensing @xcite , the probability for a remote point source at redshift @xmath7 lensed by foreground dark matter halos is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the proper distance from the observer to a lens at redshift @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the proper number density of lens objects of masses between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the lensing cross - section of a dark halo of mass @xmath12 at @xmath10 .    assuming that @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the angular - diameter distances from the observer to the lens , from the observer to the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "then the cross - section for a sis lens to produce two images with a brightness ratio @xmath18 is @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the velocity dispersion parameter .",
    "the comoving number density of dark halos formed by redshift @xmath21 with mass in the range @xmath22 is given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the present mean mass density in the universe , @xmath25 is the press - schechter function @xcite .",
    "the detailed steps for calculating the press - schechter function is described in @xcite .    with the above formulas we have calculated the lensing probability for a source object at various redshifts .",
    "the results are shown in figs . 1 - 4 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the differential lensing probability for a source located at @xmath26 where the brightness ratio between the two images is assumed to be @xmath27 .",
    "we see that the source is most likely to be lensed by a halo at @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the lens redshift @xmath10 to produce the maximal differential lensing probability as a function of the source redshift @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the integrated lensing probability as a function of the source redshift .",
    "the integrated probability increases with the redshift of the source .",
    "as the redshift goes beyond 10 , the curve becomes somewhat flat which is caused by the fact that the proper distance becomes insensitive to the variation of redshift at very large redshift .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the typical time delay between the two lensing images is shown as a function of the source redshift @xmath7 , for a lens halo of mass @xmath29 at @xmath10 determined in fig .",
    "since the discovery of frbs , several models have been proposed for interpreting their nature .",
    "these models include delayed collapse of supra - massive neutron stars to black holes @xcite , special magnetar radio flares @xcite , mergers of double neutron stars @xcite , mergers of binary white dwarfs @xcite , flaring stars @xcite , and a small fraction of events associated with gamma - ray bursts @xcite .    here",
    ", we divide all the proposed models into two types according to their origins : single star models , and double star models . accordingly , we build two models for the redshift distribution of frbs : the single star model , and the double star model .",
    "the single star model simply follows the star formation rate ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "in contrast , the double - star model follows the sfr with an evolving time delay @xcite . for both models ,",
    "we first calculate their comoving number density as a function of redshift , then calculate their redshift distribution by including the comoving volume element and the cosmological time dilation .    for the single star model , the life time of the progenitor",
    "can be neglected compared to the cosmological time .",
    "the comoving number density rate of the source is then given by the @xmath30 fitted with the formula @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "for the double star model , we insert the merger time delay into @xmath30 to get the merger rate @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , corresponding to three different evolution timescales : @xmath35 respectively @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the cosmological look - back time given by the following equation @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the inverse of the function @xmath37 .    taking into account the comoving volume element and the cosmological time dilation , the number density of frbs in the redshift space and per unit time in the observer frame is given as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the comoving volume .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the redshift distribution calculated from equation ( [ f_grb ] ) for different values of the time delay @xmath42 .",
    "the observable number density @xmath43 differs from the @xmath44 because of the observational selection effect . assuming that frbs have an intrinsic luminosity function described by a single power - law with a redshift evolution factor : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 . the observable number rate of frbs between @xmath47 is then : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant determined by detection efficiency .",
    "@xmath50 is the lower limit of luminosity caused by the telescope detection flux limit @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the luminosity distance to the source .",
    "thus , the normalized observable frbs number density rate is @xmath54    following @xcite and @xcite , we adopt @xmath55 .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the redshift distribution of the observable number density @xmath43 calculated from equation ( [ n_z ] ) for different values of the time delay @xmath42 .    both figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] indicate that as the evolution timescale increases , the peak of the frb distribution moves toward a lower redshift .",
    "to compare the lensing probability prediction with observations we must also consider the effect of magnification bias . according to @xcite ,",
    "if the sample of source objects has a power - law flux distribution @xmath56 , the magnification bias factor @xmath57 by which lensed objects will be overrepresented in any particular observed sample is given by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the minimum total magnification of the lensing event .",
    "for a sis lens the total magnification @xmath60 is related to brightening ratio @xmath61 by @xmath62 .",
    "if we require @xmath63 ( a too large value of @xmath61 may result in that one of the images becomes invisible ) , we get @xmath64 .    with the sgl probability @xmath65 and the frb number density distribution @xmath43",
    ", we can calculate the expected size of the observation sample for getting one frb lens pair with @xmath63 by : @xmath66    adopting @xmath67 @xcite and @xmath68 @xcite , we calculated the value of @xmath69 for different frb models and show the results in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we can see that the expected size of the frb observation sample @xmath69 varies significantly for different frb progenitor models .",
    "this is because that different evolution time scales in different models lead to different redshift distribution of frbs .",
    "thus a large frb lens survey collecting more than @xmath70 frbs in a complete sample may offer a way to distinguish frb progenitors .",
    "we have calculated the probability for a frb gravitationally lensed by dark matter halos in foreground galaxies . for a given population of frbs ,",
    "the needed sample size for producing a lensing event depends on the redshift distribution of the frbs .",
    "we have built four different frb redshift distribution models for four types of frb progenitors .",
    "we found that , for the four different models , the sizes of the frb samples needed for producing a lensing event are very different .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .    from table",
    "[ tab1 ] we can note that , for typical parameters adopted in the paper , the number of frbs contained in the sample can differ by an order of magnitude . at least in principle , we can carry out a large frb lens survey jointly with many radio telescopes to distinguish different frb progenitors .",
    "the observation of frbs has revealed a burst rate of @xmath71 per day @xcite , which is sufficiently high .",
    "however , we note that the sample size calculated here is for a continuous survey in a fixed field of the sky . if the survey is not continuous , a lensing event may be missed out due to the transient nature of frbs : for example , for a double - image lensing event , an image may not be detected if it occurs during a gap between two time segments of a survey because of the time - delay of gravitational lensing .",
    "then this lensing event will not be identified .    for most of the ground",
    "based interferometers , the observation time for a fixed field of the sky is discontinuous with gaps .",
    "all frbs occurring during those gaps will miss the detection , including those frb lensing events .",
    "for example , if the observation is carried on for @xmath72 hours per day , the sampling efficiency for frb lensing events will be @xmath73 since one of the double images in a lensing event may not be detected . in this case , the expected sample size given in table [ tab1 ] should be enlarged by a factor @xmath74 .",
    "however , the ratio of the sample size between different models is not affected .",
    "if the fixed field is @xmath75 and the survey program lasts @xmath76 , we have : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the area of the whole sky , @xmath79 is the total number of frbs needed in the sample , and @xmath80 is the rate of frbs . given that @xmath81 per day over the entire sky , @xmath73 , and @xmath82 for the frb model without a time delay , we have @xmath83 .",
    "this is a typical value of @xmath84 needed for a radio survey for frb lensing events .    from the above results we can predict that if a continuous frb survey for a fixed field of sky of approximately @xmath85 lasts approximately 2 years , it will be possible to constrain frb progenitors without counterpart observation .",
