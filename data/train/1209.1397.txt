    "both atlas and cms have recently announced the discovery of a higgs - like resonance with a mass of @xmath6  gev @xcite , further supported by combined tevatron data  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is whether the properties of this resonance are consistent with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson .",
    "deviations from the sm predictions could point to the existence of a secondary mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking or to other types of new physics not too far above the electroweak scale . while there is a large ongoing experimental effort to measure precisely the decay rates into the channels that dominate for the sm higgs , it is equally important to search for higgs decays into channels that are subdominant or absent in the sm .",
    "for instance , since the couplings of the higgs boson to quarks of the first two generations and to leptons are suppressed by small yukawa couplings in the sm , new physics contributions can easily dominate over the sm predictions .",
    "another possibility , and the main topic of this paper , is _ flavor violating _ ( fv )",
    "higgs decays , for instance into @xmath7 or @xmath8 final states .",
    "the study of fv couplings of the higgs boson has a long history @xcite . in this paper , we refine the indirect bounds on the fv couplings .",
    "most importantly , we discuss in detail possible search strategies for fv higgs decays at the lhc and derive for the first time limits from lhc data .    as pointed out in the previous literature , and confirmed by the present analysis , the indirect constraints on many fv higgs decays are rather weak . in particular , the branching ratios for @xmath0 and @xmath4 can reach up to 10%  @xcite .",
    "in fact , for @xmath3 and @xmath1 already now we always mean the sum of @xmath9 and @xmath10 and similarly for the other decay modes .",
    "] , without targeted searches , the lhc is placing limits that are comparable to or even stronger than those from rare @xmath11 decays . as we shall see later , re - casting a @xmath12 analysis with 4.7  fb@xmath13 of 7  tev atlas data  @xcite gives a bound on the branching fraction of the higgs into @xmath7 or @xmath14 around 10% .",
    "we will also demonstrate that dedicated searches can be much more sensitive .",
    "these decays could thus give a striking signature of new physics at the lhc , and we strongly encourage our experimental colleagues to include them in their searches . another experimentally interesting set of decay channels are flavor conserving decays to the first two generations , e.g. , @xmath15 , on which we will comment further below .",
    "we emphasize that large deviations from the sm do not require very exotic flavor structures .",
    "a branching ratio for @xmath3 comparable to the one for @xmath16 , or a @xmath17 branching ratio a few times larger than in the sm can arise in many models of flavor ( for instance in models with continuous and/or discrete flavor symmetries @xcite , or in randall - sundrum models @xcite ) as long as there is new physics at the electroweak scale and not just the sm .",
    "the lepton flavor violating decay @xmath18 has been studied in  @xcite , and it was found that the branching ratio for this decay can be up to 10% in certain two higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) .    in fact , there may already be experimental hints that the higgs couplings to fermions may not be sm - like . for instance , the babar collaboration recently announced a @xmath19 indication of flavor universality violation in @xmath20 transitions  @xcite , which can be explained for instance by an extended higgs sector with nontrivial flavor structure  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : framework ] we introduce the theoretical framework we will use to parameterize the flavor violating decays of the higgs . in sec .",
    "[ sec : leptons ] we derive bounds on flavor violating higgs couplings to leptons and translate these bounds into limits on the higgs decay branching fractions to the various flavor violating final states . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quarks ] we do the same for flavor violating couplings to quarks .",
    "we shall see that decays of the higgs to @xmath7 and to @xmath14 with sizeable branching fractions are allowed , and that also flavor violating couplings of the higgs to top quarks are only weakly constrained .",
    "motivated by this we turn to the lhc in section  [ sec : lhc ] and estimate the current bounds on higgs decays to @xmath7 and @xmath14 using data from an existing @xmath21 search .",
    "we also discuss a strategy for a dedicated @xmath22 search and comment on differences with the sm @xmath12 searches .",
    "we will see that the lhc can make significant further progress in probing the higgs flavor violating parameters space with existing data .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . in the appendices ,",
    "we give more details on the calculation of constraints from low - energy observables .",

    "thus , if the various lepton flavor combinations were studied separately in the @xmath323 analyses , stronger bounds on flavor violating decays could be inferred .",
    "* _ kinematics and efficiencies .",

    "furthermore , in @xmath363 events the missing energy is roughly aligned with the hadronic @xmath11 . as a result",
    "the two channels can have different efficiencies given the same cuts .",
    "for example , in the vbf analysis described below ( mimicking  @xcite ) the efficiency for @xmath362 is a factor of @xmath374 lower than for @xmath368 events , mostly because many of the muons in the @xmath362 sample fall below the @xmath375  gev cut . * _ mass reconstruction .",
    "_ the lhc collaborations use highly optimized procedures for reconstructing the @xmath376 invariant mass .",
    "atlas uses the missing mass calculator ( mmc ) from  @xcite , while cms uses an in - house maximum likelihood analysis  @xcite .",

    "if the event is not from @xmath16 but instead from @xmath380 , then i ) the efficiency will be significantly lower since the kinematics can be completely inconsistent with a @xmath5 event , and ii ) the reconstructed higgs mass will be significantly higher as the mmc will assume that the hard muon is accompanied by two roughly collinear and hard neutrinos .",
    "this illustrates that a mass reconstruction procedure designed for the specific final state under consideration is mandatory to obtain the best possible sensitivity .",
    "* _ backgrounds . _",
    "the backgrounds for @xmath362 and @xmath381 events are similar , but because of the different invariant mass reconstruction techniques , the reconstructed background spectra will typically be harder for a @xmath382 analysis , which assumes three neutrinos in the final state , than for a @xmath383 analysis which assumes only one .",
    "this implies , for instance , that the peak from the @xmath384 background will appear at a @xmath376 invariant mass around 90  gev in a search for @xmath382 , but well below ( and thus further away from the signal peak ) in a dedicated @xmath385 analysis .",

    "in particular , since the @xmath387 final state contains only one neutrino ( from the hadronic @xmath11 ) , this mass reconstruction can always be done exactly ( i.e.  the neutrino momentum can be determined ) up to a two - fold ambiguity .",
