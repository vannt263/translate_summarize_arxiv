    "the kondo effect is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the area of electron transport in nanostructures @xcite . for its existence",
    "a small system with internal degrees of freedom ( e.g. a quantum dot with spin ) , coupled to a sufficiently large conduction electron system ( the leads ) is required . if certain symmetries are satisfied , the localized spin forms a resonance state with the surrounding conduction electron spins at the fermi level , of energy width @xmath4 , the kondo temperature ( here and in the following we use units where boltzmann s constant @xmath5 and planck s constant @xmath6 ) .",
    "a finite bias voltage @xmath2 applied across the quantum dot is known to destroy the kondo resonance , provided @xmath7 .",
    "it has been argued that the limitation in the coherence time brought about by inelastic processes in the leads causes the suppression of the kondo effect at finite @xmath8 , since it cuts off the renormalization group flow of the coupling constant @xcite . at sufficiently large @xmath2",
    "this cutoff is still within the perturbative regime . in that case",
    "the perturbative rg treatment ( `` poor man s scaling '' , @xcite )  generalized to nonequilibrium , proposed in @xcite ,  provides a controlled and complete description of all physical quantities .",
    "indeed the latter theory has been used to decribe experimental data for various situations , each time with excellent success @xcite .",
    "while the effect of decoherence on the rg flow of the coupling constant has been included in @xcite in a phenomenological way , it is of interest to derive the effect of the decoherence rate in a systematic fashion . the way in which the decoherence rate cuts off the logarithmic singularities in perturbation theory has been analyzed in paaske2 , where it has been found that the decoherence appears in the form of physically accessible rates , namely the longitudinal and transverse spin relaxation rates . in a completely new way the effect of decoherence on the kondo effect has been analyzed within the flow equation method kehrein1 , with results in agreement with and thus confirming the work by paaske et al . @xcite .",
    "the latter method is , however , not easily applicable to the calculation of observable quantities like the conductance .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to work out a systematic and consistent derivation of the coupled rg - equations for the coupling function and the decoherence rate , even in the weak coupling regime .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has not been possible , so far , to calculate the influence of a finite bias voltage in the strong coupling regime .",
    "there are several methods available describing properties of the kondo system at strong coupling in equilibrium ( see @xcite ) , but a general and practically applicable extension of these methods to nonequilibrium has not been found yet .",
    "a recently proposed  `` conserving t - matrix approximation '' , based on self - consistent renormalized perturbation theory including all two - particle channels , which has been shown to recover correctly the fermi liquid behavior at low energies and the crossover to the local moment regime @xcite , may in principle be generalized to nonequilibrium , but is at present too costly in numerical evaluation effort .    in this paper we present results for the weak - coupling regime of the kondo model in and out of equilibrium obtained by the functional renormalization group ( frg )",
    "method @xcite .",
    "the frg is a powerful tool when dealing with the diversity of energy scales and the interplay of correlations in an interacting fermionic systems such as the kondo model where the microscopic energy scale band width @xmath9 and the dynamically generated energy scale kondo temperature @xmath4 differ by orders of magnitude .",
    "the frg uses an exact mapping of the initial model to models with reduced band width .",
    "the mapping generates an infinite hierarchy of flow equations , describing the gradual evolution from a microscopic model hamiltonian to the effective action as a function of a continuously decreasing energy cutoff . in practice ,",
    "one modifies the bare propagator by cutting off frequencies smaller then some infrared cutoff @xmath10 . as this cutoff",
    "is progressively lowered more and more low - energy degrees of freedom are included , until the original model is recovered for @xmath11 .",
    "the conventionally used approximation consists of a suitable truncation of the hierarchy of equations .",
    "we find that the truncation neglecting three particle and higher order correlation functions , and keeping only the self energy together with the four - point vertex function captures the weak coupling regime ( @xmath12 ) completely . in this paper",
    "we show in detail how the transport properties of a kondo quantum dot in the weak - coupling regime may be calculated in a systematic and complete way .",
    "compared to previous applications of the frg method to kondo physics ( jak and ref . therein ) our approach differs in at least two ways : ( 1 ) the present work addresses the kondo model , rather than the anderson model ( compare , however , the recent work @xcite in which the dynamical spin response of the kondo model has been considered , using a real - time rg method @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) in contrast to previous frg works we include the effect of the decoherence rate .",
    "we consider the model of a quantum dot described by a spin @xmath13 operator @xmath14 coupled by exchange interaction and tunneling to the conduction electron spins as described by the hamiltonian @xmath15 here @xmath16 labels the leads assumed to be in equilibrium at chemical potentials @xmath17 and @xmath18 are spin indices .",

    "the relaxation rate @xmath186 , however , comes out three orders of magnitude too small .",
    "we conclude that higher order terms in the @xmath197 -function are not sufficient to cure the problem with @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , the frequency dependence of both , @xmath108 and @xmath68 is essential in reaching the fermi liquid regime , as we now sketch .",

    "this deficient behavior may also be remedied by taking the energy dependence of @xmath91 and @xmath108 into account .",
    "qualitatively one expects that the smearing of the sharp singular structures in @xmath140 and @xmath141 by integrations over @xmath203 within the width @xmath91 specified by the pseudofermion spectral functions will be equivalent to replacing @xmath121 and @xmath204 by @xmath205  and @xmath206 , which are both finite quantities of @xmath207 and  @xmath208 , respectively , not only at the end of the rg process ( at @xmath202 ) , but already at @xmath209 .     versus of @xmath187 (",

    "with the advent of nanophysics in the mid 1990s it became possible to fabricate nanostructures with the properties of single atoms .",
    "in contrast to real atoms these artificial atoms may be contacted by metallic leads , opening a new way of probing their properties in transport measurements .",
    "this development led to a revival of kondo physics , a subject that had emerged in studies of dilute magnetic alloys .",
    "even though the kondo effect had been well understood by the mid 1970s , the new development required theories describing the kondo effect out of equilibrium .",
    "most of the theoretical methods created to describe the kondo effect in equilibrium do not work or work only in a limited way for systems out of equilibrium .",
    "a good starting point is perturbation theory in the keldysh formulation .",
    "however , due to the infrared singular behavior of the kondo problem , simple perturbation theory is not sufficient . in equilibrium",
    "the powerful method of the renormalization group has been proposed and successfully implemented first by anderson in the perturbative regime and later by wilson , all the way to strong coupling .",
    "anderson s perturbative treatment has been generalized to non - equilibrium in  @xcite  , after recognizing two important new features .",
    "first , in nonequilibrium the coupling constant has to be generalized to an energy dependent coupling function .",
    "second , the processes limiting the quantum coherence of the allimportant spin flip processes that are responsible for the kondo effect in the first place , become more important out of equilibrium and may stop the rg flow to strong coupling inside the weak coupling regime . the latter lead to a decoherence rate , which in pertrg1,pertrg2  was added ad hoc to the rg equations . in the present paper the decoherence rate",
    "is treated from the beginning on equal footing with the coupling function .",
    "it is known @xcite that the decoherence rate is given by the physical spin relaxation rate . in technical terms , the spin relaxation rate has contributions from the self energy as well as from vertex corrections . within the standard quantum field",
    "theoretical formalism used in this paper , it is straightforward to incorporate the self energy contribution . to include",
    "the vertex corrections would require to take into account three particle processes as well .",
    "the latter are beyond the scope of what has been done in the present paper .",
    "there exist different formulations based on the liouville operator formalism @xcite or the flow equation method @xcite , which allow to take into account vertex corrections in a systematic way .",
    "however , these methods have their own drawbacks .",
    "the main achievement of the present paper is therefore the principal demonstration of the appearance and the actual calculation of the effect of the decoherence rate on the rg flow for the kondo model .",
    "it is tempting to explore the importance of the decoherence processes in cutting off the rg flow to strong coupling in equilibrium , where it is strongest . from the known behavior of the spin relaxation rate as a function of temperature",
    "one would expect that at temperatures at and below the kondo temperature the rg flow is already cut off and the coupling constant would tend to a temperature independent value with @xmath213 -corrections at low @xmath1 .",
    "we found something different : apparently the coupling function @xmath214 grows to values much larger than unity , without , however , violating the unitarity limit .",
    "a careful solution of the frequency dependent rg equations is a subject for future work .",
    "if the coupling grows to large values one should expect higher order processes to become important .",
    "we have added higher order terms to the rg equation , in such a way that @xmath195 tends to a finite value of order unity , recovering the unitarity limit of the conductance in its simplest form .",
    "the resulting conductance curve is in good agreement with nrg results known for the equilibrium case , and allows to explore the behavior at finite bias voltage .",
    "we are grateful to hans kroha and achim rosch for useful discussions in the early stages of this work .",
    "special thanks are owed to jens paaske for discussions on many aspects of rg in the kondo problem ."
