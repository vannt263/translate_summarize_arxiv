    "driven by a search for new fundamental symmetries in nature@xcite , the paper attempts to implement a uniform background field into the flat space - time .",
    "such a background field connected to a uniform vacuum energy density represents a preferred reference frame , which leads us to postulate a universal minimum limit of speed for particles with very large wavelengths ( very low energies ) .",
    "the idea that some symmetries of a fundamental theory of quantum gravity may have non trivial consequences for cosmology and particle physics at very low energies is interesting and indeed quite reasonable .",
    "so , it seems that the idea of a universal minimum speed as one of the first attempts of lorentz symmetry violation could have the origin from a fundamental theory of quantum gravity at very low energies ( very large wavelengths ) .",
    "the hypothesis of the lowest non - null limit of speed ( @xmath2 ) for low energies ( @xmath3 ) in space - time results in the following physical reasoning :    - in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the plane wave wave - function ( @xmath4 ) which represents a free particle is an idealisation that is impossible to conceive under physical reality . in the event of such an idealized plane wave , it would be possible to find with certainty the reference frame that cancels its momentum ( @xmath5 ) , so that the uncertainty on its position would be @xmath6 .",
    "however , the presence of an unattainable minimum ( non - zero ) limit of speed emerges in order to prevent the ideal case of a plane wave wave - function ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 with @xmath6 ) .",
    "this means that there is no perfect inertial motion ( @xmath9 ) such as a plane wave , except the privileged reference frame of a universal background field connected to an unattainable minimum limit of speed @xmath2 , where @xmath0 would vanish .",
    "however , since such a minimum speed @xmath2 ( universal background frame @xmath10 ) is unattainable for the particles with low energies ( large wavelengths ) , their momentum can actually never vanish when one tries to be closer to such a preferred frame ( @xmath2 ) , as it will be shown that there is an insuperable energy barrier when one tries to decelerate a particle very close to the vacuum regime of the background frame @xmath10 , which represents a fundamental zero - point energy for @xmath11 ( see section 5 ) .    on the other hand , according to special relativity ( sr ) , the momentum can not be infinite since the maximum speed @xmath12 is also unattainable for a massive particle , except the photon ( @xmath13 ) as it is a massless particle .",
    "this reasoning allows us to think that the electromagnetic radiation ( photon:@xmath14 ) as well as the massive particle ( @xmath15 for @xmath16 ) are in equal - footing in the sense that it is not possible to find a reference frame at rest ( @xmath17 ) for both through any speed transformation in a space - time with a maximum and a minimum limit of speed .",
    "thus such a doubly special relativity with an invariant minimum speed will be denominated as symmetrical special relativity ( ssr ) .",
    "we will look for new speed transformations of ssr in the next section .    in a future paper",
    ", we will investigate the origin of the minimum speed @xmath2 , which could have a direct connection with the planck length , i.e. , the minimum length @xmath18 in a quantum gravity theory .",
    "the dynamics of particles in the presence of a universal background reference frame connected to @xmath2 is within a context of the ideas of sciama@xcite , schrdinger@xcite and mach@xcite , where there should be an  absolute \" inertial reference frame in relation to which we have the inertia of all moving bodies .",
    "however , we must emphasize that the approach used here is not classical as machian ideas , since the lowest ( unattainable ) limit of speed @xmath2 plays the role of a privileged ( inertial ) reference frame of background field instead of the  inertial \" frame of fixed stars .",
    "it is very curious to notice that the idea of a universal background field was sought in vain by einstein@xcite , motivated firstly by lorentz .",
    "it was einstein who coined the term _ ultra - referential _ as the fundamental aspect of reality to represent a universal background field@xcite .",
    "based on such a concept , let us call _ ultra - referential _ @xmath10 to be the universal background field of a fundamental inertial reference frame connected to @xmath2 .",
    "the present doubly special relativity ( ssr ) is a kind of deformed special relativity ( dsr ) with two invariant scales , namely the speed of light @xmath12 and a minimum speed @xmath2 .",
    "dsr theory was first investigated by camelia et al.@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it contains two invariant scales : the speed of light @xmath12 and a minimum length scale ( planck length @xmath19 of quantum gravity ) .",
    "an alternative approach to dsr theory , inspired by that of camelia , was proposed later by smolin and magueijo@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "another extension of special relativity ( sr ) is known as triply special relativity , which is characterized by three invariant scales , namely the speed of light @xmath12 , a mass @xmath20 and a length @xmath21@xcite .",
    "still another generalization of sr is the quantizing of speeds@xcite , where barrett - crane spin foam model for quantum gravity with positive cosmological constant was considered , encouraging the authors to look for a discrete spectrum of velocities and the physical implications of this effect , namely an effective deformed poincar symmetry .",
    "the classical notion we have about the inertial ( galilean ) reference frames , where the system at rest exists , is eliminated in ssr where @xmath22 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "however , if we consider classical systems composed of macroscopic bodies , the minimum speed @xmath2 is neglected ( @xmath23 ) and so we can reach a vanishing velocity ( @xmath24 ) , i.e. , in the classical approximation ( @xmath25 ) , the ultra - referential ( background frame ) @xmath10 is eliminated and simply replaced by the galilean reference frame @xmath26 connected to a classical system at rest .",
    "since we can not consider a reference system made up of a set of infinite points at rest in quantum space - time with an invariant minimum speed , then we should define a new status of referentials , namely a non - galilean reference system , which is given essentially as a set of all the particles having the same state of movement ( speed @xmath27 ) with respect to the ultra - referential @xmath10 ( preferred reference frame of the background field ) , so that @xmath28 , @xmath2 being unapproachable and connected to @xmath10 .",
    "so , a set of particles with the same speed @xmath27 with respect to the ultra - referential @xmath10 provides a given non - galilean framework .",
    "hence , ssr should contain three postulates , namely :    1)-the non - equivalence ( asymmetry ) of the non - galilean reference frames due to the presence of the background frame @xmath10 that breaks down lorentz symmetry , i.e. , we can not exchange @xmath27 for @xmath29 by means of inverse transformations , since we can not achieve a rest state ( @xmath24 ) for a certain non - galilean reference frame in order to reverse the direction of its velocity only for one spatial dimension ;    2)-the invariance of the speed of light ( @xmath12 ) ;    3)-the covariance of the ultra - referential @xmath10 ( background framework ) connected to an invariant and unattainable minimum limit of speed @xmath2 , i.e. , all the non - galilean reference frames with speeds @xmath30 experience the same background frame @xmath10 , in the sense that the background energy ( vacuum energy ) at @xmath10 does not produce a flow @xmath29 at any of these referentials .",
    "thus , @xmath10 does not work like the newtonian absolute space filled by luminiferous ( galilean ) ether in the old ( classical ) sense , in spite of @xmath10 s being linked to a background energy that works like a _ non - galilean `` ether '' _ , leading to the well - known vacuum energy density ( cosmological constant ) , as we will show later .",
    "the third postulate is directly connected to the second one .",
    "such a connection will be clarified by investigating the new velocity transformations to be obtained soon .",
    "of course if we consider @xmath23 , we recover the well - known two postulates of sr , i.e. , we get the equivalence of inertial reference frames , where one can exchange @xmath27 for @xmath29 with appropriate transformations and , consequently , this leads to the absence of such a background field ( @xmath10 ) ; however , the constancy of the speed of light is still preserved .",
    "let us assume the reference frame @xmath31 with a speed @xmath27 in relation to the ultra - referential @xmath10 according to fig.1 .",
    "moves with a speed @xmath32 with respect to the background field of the covariant ultra - referential @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath25 , @xmath10 is eliminated ( empty space ) and , thus , the galilean frame @xmath26 takes place , recovering the lorentz transformations . ]",
    "so , to simplify , consider the motion only at one spatial dimension , namely @xmath33 space - time with the background field @xmath10 .",
    "so we write the following transformations :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 , being @xmath36 and @xmath37 , so that @xmath38 for @xmath11 or @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40    being @xmath41 .",
    "we have @xmath42 .",
    "if we make @xmath25 ( @xmath43 ) , we recover the lorentz transformations , where the ultra - referential @xmath10 is eliminated and simply replaced by the galilean frame @xmath26 at rest for a classical observer .    in order to get the transformations in eq.(1 ) and eq.(2 ) above ,",
    "let us consider the following more general transformations : @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are factors ( functions ) to be determined .",
    "we hope all these factors depend on @xmath49 , such that , for @xmath43 ( @xmath25 ) , we recover lorentz transformations as a particular case ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) . by using those transformations to perform @xmath53 $ ]",
    ", we find the identity : @xmath53= \\theta^2\\gamma^2[c^2t^2 - 2\\epsilon_1vtx+2\\epsilon_2vtx-\\epsilon_1 ^ 2v^2t^2+\\frac{\\epsilon_2 ^ 2v^2x^2}{c^2}-x^2]$ ] .",
    "since the metric tensor is diagonal , the crossed terms must vanish and so we assure that @xmath54 . due to this fact",
    ", the crossed terms ( @xmath55 ) are cancelled between themselves and finally we obtain @xmath53=   \\theta^2\\gamma^2(1-\\frac{\\epsilon^2 v^2}{c^2})[c^2t^2-x^2]$ ] . for @xmath43 ( @xmath56 and @xmath50 ) , we reinstate @xmath53=[c^2t^2-x^2]$ ] of sr .",
    "now we write the following transformations : @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where we assume @xmath59 and @xmath60 , so that @xmath61 for @xmath25 , which implies @xmath56 .",
    "so , from such transformations we extract : @xmath62 and @xmath63 , from where we obtain @xmath64 . as @xmath65 is a dimensionaless factor",
    ", we immediately conclude that @xmath66 and @xmath67 , so that we find @xmath68 . on the other hand",
    ", we can determine @xmath46 as follows : @xmath46 is a function of @xmath49 ( @xmath69 ) , such that @xmath50 for @xmath70 , which also leads to @xmath56 in order to recover the lorentz transformations .",
    "so , as @xmath65 depends on @xmath49 , we conclude that @xmath46 can also be expressed in terms of @xmath65 , namely @xmath71 $ ] , where @xmath72 .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath73=[f(\\alpha)(1-\\alpha)]^k$ ] , where the exponent @xmath74 . the function @xmath75 and @xmath20 will be estimated by satisfying the following conditions :    \\i ) as @xmath50 for @xmath70 ( @xmath23 ) , this implies @xmath76 .",
    "\\ii ) the function @xmath77^k}{(1-\\beta^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}=\\frac{[f(\\alpha)(1-\\alpha)]^k } { [ ( 1+\\beta)(1-\\beta)]^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$ ] should have a symmetrical behavior , that is to say it goes to zero closer to @xmath2 ( @xmath39 ) in the same way it goes to infinite closer to @xmath12 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "in other words , this means that the numerator of the function @xmath79 , which depends on @xmath49 should have the same shape of its denumerator , which depends on @xmath80 . due to such conditions",
    ", we naturally conclude that @xmath81 and @xmath82 , so that @xmath83^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{[(1+\\beta)(1-\\beta)]^{\\frac{1}{2}}}= \\frac{(1-\\alpha^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{(1-\\beta^2)^\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{1-v^2/v^2}}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}=\\psi$ ] , where @xmath84 .",
    "the transformations shown in eq.(1 ) and eq.(2 ) are the direct transformations from @xmath10 [ @xmath85 to @xmath31 [ @xmath86 , where we have @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , so that we obtain the following matrix of transformation :    @xmath89    such that @xmath90 ( lorentz matrix of rotation ) for @xmath43 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath92 $ ] , where @xmath93 . since @xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) is unattainable ( @xmath94 , this assures that @xmath95 and therefore the matrix @xmath96 admits inverse ( @xmath97 @xmath98 ) .",
    "however , @xmath96 is a non - orthogonal matrix ( @xmath99 ) and so it does not represent a rotation matrix ( @xmath100 ) in such a space - time due to the presence of the privileged frame of background field @xmath10 that breaks strongly the invariance of the norm of the 4-vector ( limit @xmath11 in eq.(30 ) or eq.(31 ) ) .",
    "actually such an effect ( @xmath101 for @xmath102 or @xmath103 ) emerges from a new relativistic physics of ssr for treating much lower energies at ultra - infrared regime closer to @xmath10 ( very large wavelengths ) .",
    "we notice that @xmath104 is a function of the speed @xmath27 with respect to @xmath10 . in the approximation for @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath107 and so we practically reinstate the rotation behavior of lorentz matrix @xmath108 as a particular regime for higher energies .",
    "if we make @xmath25 ( @xmath43 ) , we recover @xmath109 ( rotation condition ) .",
    "this subject will be explored with more details in section 3 , where we will verify whether eq.(3 ) forms a group .",
    "we will explore deep physical implications of such a result that will also lead to the tiny positive value of the cosmological constant ( section 6 ) .",
    "the inverse transformations ( from @xmath31 to @xmath10 ) are    @xmath110    @xmath111    in matrix form , we have the inverse transformation @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , so that the inverse matrix is    @xmath114    where we can show that @xmath115=@xmath116 $ ] , so that we must satisfy @xmath117 .",
    "indeed we have @xmath118 and therefore @xmath119 .",
    "this aspect of @xmath96 has an important physical implication . in order to understand such an implication ,",
    "let us first consider the rotation aspect of lorentz matrix in sr . under sr , we have @xmath70 ( @xmath23 ) , so that @xmath120 .",
    "this symmetry ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) happens because the galilean reference frames allow us to exchange the speed @xmath27 ( of @xmath31 ) for @xmath29 ( of @xmath26 ) when we are at rest at @xmath31 .",
    "however , under ssr , since there is no rest at @xmath31 , we can not exchange @xmath27 ( of @xmath31 ) for @xmath29 ( of @xmath10 ) due to that asymmetry ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) . due to this fact",
    ", @xmath10 must be covariant , namely @xmath2 remains invariant for any change of reference frame in such a space - time .",
    "thus we can notice that the paradox of twins , which appears due to that symmetry by exchange of @xmath27 for @xmath29 in sr should be naturally eliminated in ssr , where only the reference frame @xmath31 can move with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "so , @xmath10 remains covariant ( invariant for any change of reference frame ) .",
    "such a covariance will be verified soon .",
    "we have @xmath123\\rightarrow [ ( det\\lambda)\\psi^{-2}]=[1-\\beta^2(1-\\alpha)^2]$ ] .",

    "the speeds @xmath130 and @xmath27 are now given with respect to the background frame @xmath10 , which is covariant ( absolute ) .",

    "it is well - known that the lorentz transformations form a group ( @xmath172 ) , since they obey the following conditions , namely : a ) @xmath173 ( closure condition ) ; b ) @xmath174 ( associativity ) ; c ) @xmath175 , such that @xmath176 ( identity element ) ; d ) @xmath177 , being @xmath178 ( inverse element ) .",
    "our goal is to make an analysis of the new transformations in eq.(1 ) and eq.(2 ) with regard to the conditions above in order to verify whether they form a group and discuss deeply the results .",
    "so , to do that , we first rewrite the matrix @xmath96 ( eq.(3 ) ) , namely :    @xmath179    where @xmath180 .",
    "we have defined the notation @xmath181 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath25 or @xmath43 , we recover the lorentz matrix , i.e. , @xmath182 , since @xmath91 and @xmath183 .",

    "however , we first realize that such speed transformation , which should be obeyed in order to satisfy the closure condition , differs from the correct speed transformation ( eq.(8 ) ) that has origin from the space - time transformations with a minimum speed given in eq.(4 ) and eq.(5 ) .",

    "one of the conditions for having the closure relation is that the components outside the diagonal of the matrix in eq.(14 ) or eq.(15 ) must include @xmath201 given by eq.(8 ) , which does not occur .",
    "therefore , we are already able to conclude that such condition is not obeyed in a spacetime with a minimum speed ( a preferred reference frame ) at the subatomic level , i.e. , we find @xmath203 , which does not generate a group . in order to clarify further this question , we just make the approximation @xmath23 or also @xmath204 and @xmath205 in eq.(14 ) , and thus we recover the closure relation of the lorentz group , as follows :    @xmath206    where    @xmath207    which is the closure condition of the lorentz group , since now it is obvious that the lorentz transformation of speeds appears outside the diagonal of the matrix in eq.(16 ) , i.e. , we find @xmath208 $ ] . and , in order to complete the verification of the closure condition above , it is easy to verify that the multiplicative term of the matrix ( eq.(16 ) ) is @xmath209 .",

    "although we already know that the new transformations do not form a group , it is still important to provide a physical justification for such conclusion . to do this with more clarity , we also should investigate whether the identity element and the inverse element exist in such a spacetime with an invariant minimum speed , since these two conditions are relevant to give us a clear comprehension of the conception of motion in this spacetime .    *",

    "we have also concluded that the new matrix @xmath96 ( eq.(3 ) ) does not represent a rotation matrix ( section 2 ) . in view of this , we can realize that such transformations are not related with the well - known rotation group @xmath232 ( lie group ) , whose elements @xmath233 and @xmath234 should obey a closure condition @xmath235 , such that @xmath236 , with @xmath237 being a new rotation that belongs to the group , so that @xmath238 ( rotation condition ) , while we find @xmath239 $ ] , where @xmath240 , violating the rotation condition .    although there could be a more complex mathematical structure in order to encompass the new transformations , which should be deeply investigated , at least , here we will make some interesting mathematical approximations on @xmath96 in order to help us to understand further the nature of the new transformations .    in a certain approximation ,",
    "let us show that @xmath96 is a combination of rotation and deformation of the space - time interval @xmath241 , reminding the polar decomposition theorem in linear algebra for a  rigid \" body that rotates and deforms .",
    "intuitively , the polar decomposition separates a certain matrix @xmath242 into a component that stretches the space along a set of orthogonal axes , represented by @xmath243 , and a rotation ( with possible reflection ) represented by @xmath244 , i.e. , @xmath245 . where @xmath244 is a unitary",
    "matrix and @xmath243 is a hermitian matrix .",
    "when a rigid body rotates , its length remains invariant .",
    "this effect is analogous to the invariance of the space - time interval @xmath241 under the lorentz transformation @xmath108 ( lorentz group ) due to a rotation .    when a `` rigid '' body deforms , such effect is analogous to a deformation ( e.g : stretching ) of the spacetime interval @xmath241 that occurs close to the minimum speed ( see eq.(30 ) and eq.(31 ) for @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus , at a first sight , the new transformation @xmath96 could be written simply as a polar decomposition , so that @xmath246 , where @xmath108 is a rotation matrix ( lorentz matrix ) as a special case of the unitary matrix @xmath244 and @xmath247 is a deformation matrix ( symmetric matrix ) as a special case of the hermitian matrix @xmath243 , since hermitian matrices can be understood as the complex extension of real symmetric matrices .",
    "however , we can verify that such analogy fails quantitatively when one tries to calculate an exact matrix @xmath248 that satisfies the linear decomposition @xmath249 for any speed @xmath27 ( any energy scale ) , i.e. , there is no @xmath248 that satisfies such decomposition , because it seems that we have a kind of non - linear or inseparable combination of rotation and deformation .",
    "so , in order to accomplish a stronger analogy with the polar decomposition , we need to make some mathematical approximations on the matrix @xmath96 in such a way that we can be able to separate both effects of rotation and deformation . to do this , let us first write the matrix @xmath96 in the following way :    @xmath250    instead of making @xmath70 ( or @xmath23 ) in order to recover the lorentz matrix @xmath108 , here we make an alternative approximation , namely @xmath105 , which means that , for higher energies , we recover practically the matrix @xmath108 ( rotation ) . on the other hand , for much lower energies , i.e. , for @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) , we get    @xmath251    where we have considered the lhpital s rule , by calculating @xmath252 .",
    "in other words , this means that @xmath253 , so that we can neglect @xmath254 with respect to @xmath255 in such an approximation ( @xmath103 ) , i.e , we make @xmath256 into @xmath96 , keeping the factor @xmath257 .",
    "we obtain @xmath258=\\theta^2=(1-\\alpha^2)=(1-v^2/v^2)$ ] .",
    "the inverse matrix @xmath259 is    @xmath260    where @xmath261=\\theta^{-2}=(1-\\alpha^2)^{-1}=(1-v^2/v^2)^{-1}$ ] .",
    "both the symmetric matrices in eq.(19 ) and eq.(20 ) represent deformations , where , for instance , the matrix in eq.(20 ) leads to a stretching of the space - time interval @xmath241 when @xmath27 is closer to @xmath2 .",
    "we realize that such deformations given only for much lower energies close to the background frame @xmath10 , i.e. , the matrices @xmath262 and @xmath263 do not belong to the structure of the lie group connected to the indentity matrix @xmath264 .",
    "we conclude that the matrix @xmath96 in eq.(18 ) already contains effects of deformation ( @xmath265 ) , which become completely evident for much lower energies ( @xmath103 ) , where @xmath266 , but , when the speed @xmath27 increases drastically , i.e. , @xmath105 , so , now , the rotations of lorentz group are pratically recovered ( @xmath267 ) and , thus , we recover the invariance @xmath268 . with such approximations ,",
    "the polar decomposition is practically valid by making @xmath269 , so that we can verify the product @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is a symmetric matrix , which is exactly the reason for the effects of deformation of @xmath241 close to @xmath2 .",
    "we finally conclude that the set formed by the matrices that appear above does not have a group structure or can not be considered as a poincar s subgroup .",
    "this point must be discussed in depth .",
    "our next step will be to make an investigation of the main effect obtained directly from the violation of the rotation structure at much lower speeds ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "such an effect should naturally lead to other deep implications , which will be pointed out , so that we will realize that the whole theory contains elements that are connected by a same mathematical and physical structure .",
    "when we make a lorentz transformation @xmath272 from the frame @xmath273 to @xmath31 with speed @xmath27 with regard to @xmath26 , we have the well - known  boost \" .",
    "as the boosts represent rotations , the minimal boost is the identity matrix @xmath274 connected to the rest state , such that @xmath275 .",
    "however , as such minimal boost does not make sense in this spacetime with a minimum speed that prevents the rest state , we must stress that the component @xmath276 in the new transformation ( @xmath277 leads to a non - existence of boosts only in the approximation for much lower energies ( @xmath11 or @xmath39 ) , due to the fact that we get @xmath278 .",
    "so , only for higher energies ( @xmath105 or @xmath106 ) , we get @xmath279 and , thus , @xmath280 , recovering the regime where the boosts take place ( lorentz group ) .    in short , the effects of  boosts \" are generally weakened in this spacetime , mainly in the regime when @xmath103 , i.e. , much closer to the background frame @xmath10 .",
    "so , it is important to stress that , in such special regime , there are no boosts and , therefore , the transformation @xmath281 has another meaning since it does not lead to the change of reference frames .",
    "we will go deeper into this issue .    actually , the symmetric matrix @xmath281 ( eq.(19 ) ) is the reason of breaking the structure of rotation group ( boosts ) and it should be interpreted just as a scale transformation ( @xmath46 ) that provides a variation of the usual space - time interval ( @xmath241 ) in function of speed @xmath27 , especially when @xmath27 is close to @xmath2 .",
    "the deep physical implication directly related to the effect of variation of @xmath241 will be investigated below .",
    "since the matrix @xmath281 just deforms the interval @xmath241 , this transformation does not act for changing the reference frames . in view of this",
    ", we use the following notation to represent such a scale transformation , namely :    @xmath282    where @xmath283 is the deformed vector , @xmath46 being a scale factor , since @xmath284 , so that we get    @xmath285ds^2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath286 is the usual squared space - time interval of sr and @xmath287 is the deformed squared space - time interval due to new relativistic effects closer to v ( no boosts ) .    as the usual interval @xmath241 does not remain invariant in this spacetime , specially when @xmath103 ; so according to eq.(22 ) , we realize that the deformed interval @xmath288 should be the new invariant interval under the change of reference frames in this flat spacetime with the presence of the background frame @xmath10 , such that @xmath289 . in doing this",
    ", we introduce a new invariance of deformed intervals in ssr , namely :    @xmath290    where @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "of course if we make @xmath25 or @xmath43 in eq.(23 ) , we recover the invariance of the usual ( non - deformed ) @xmath241 of sr , i.e. , @xmath293 .",
    "indeed we realize that the deformed interval @xmath294 remains finite ( eq.23 ) , since , in the limit of @xmath295 ( @xmath11 ) , the usual interval @xmath241 undergoes a very large stretching , i.e. , @xmath296 .    from eq.(23 ) , we obtain    @xmath297    where , in this case , we have @xmath298 and @xmath299 . now ,",
    "if we make @xmath300 ( or @xmath301 , i.e. , at the origin of the reference frame @xmath31 ) , from eq.(24 ) we obtain    @xmath302    where we have considered @xmath303 and so @xmath304 , with @xmath305 being the deformed proper time interval , where we have @xmath306 .",
    "this result has a deep physical implication that has origin in the breakdown of the structure of lorentz group .",
    "now we are ready to investigate the physical implication from eq.(25 ) .",
    "so , by simply making @xmath307 in eq.(25 ) and performing the calculations , we finally obtain    @xmath308    and , then    @xmath309    where @xmath310 is the proper time interval and @xmath311 is the improper one .",
    "eq.(27 ) is the immediate physical implication of the violation of lorentz group by means of the symmetric matrix @xmath281 ( eq.(19 ) ) that deforms the proper time , so that we can also write eq.(27 ) as being @xmath312 , where @xmath313 .",
    "it is important to call attention to the fact that eq.(27 ) shows us that the proper time interval @xmath310 depends on speed @xmath27 and , thus , now it can also be deformed ( dilated ) like the improper time interval .",
    "so , we realize that eq.(27 ) reveals a perfect symmetry in the sense that both intervals of time @xmath311 and @xmath310 can dilate , namely @xmath311 dilates for @xmath168 and , on the other hand , @xmath310 dilates for @xmath11 .",
    "but , if we make @xmath25 , we break down such new symmetry of ssr and so we recover the well - known time equation of sr , where only @xmath311 dilates and @xmath310 remains invariant .    from eq.(27 ) we notice that , if we make @xmath314 ( a geometric average between @xmath12 and @xmath2 ) , we find exactly the equality @xmath310 ( at @xmath31)=@xmath311 ( at @xmath26 ) , namely this is a newtonian result where the time intervals are the same .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath315 represents a special intermediary speed in ssr ( @xmath316 ) such that , if :    \\a ) @xmath317 ( or @xmath168 ) , we get @xmath318 .",
    "this is the well - known _ improper time dilation_.    \\b ) @xmath319 ( or @xmath11 ) , we get @xmath320 .",
    "let us call such a new effect as _ improper time contraction _ or _",
    "dilation of the proper time interval @xmath310 with respect to the improper time interval @xmath311_. this new effect becomes more evident only for @xmath321 , so that , in this limit , we have @xmath322 for a certain @xmath311 fixed as being finite .",
    "in other words , this means that the proper time ( @xmath31 ) can now elapse much faster than the improper one .",
    "it is interesting to notice that we restore the newtonian regime when @xmath166 , which represents a regime of intermediary speeds , so that we get the newtonian approximation from eq.(27 ) , i.e. , @xmath323 .    squaring both members of eq.(27 ) ( @xmath324 ) and manipulating the result",

    "the hypotenuse of the triangle is @xmath328 , which represents the spatio - temporal speed of any particle .",
    "if @xmath25 in eq.(29 ) , we recover the time equation in sr , i.e. , @xmath329 .",
    "looking at fig.3 , now we see clearly three important cases , namely :    \\a ) if @xmath330 , @xmath331 ( the marching of proper time in @xmath31 is much slower than in @xmath26 ) , such that @xmath332 , with @xmath333 , leading to the well - known dilation of the improper time .",
    "\\b ) if @xmath314 , @xmath334 , i.e. , the marching of time in @xmath31 is faster , but it is still in an intermediary regime , such that @xmath335 , with @xmath336 ( newtonian regime ) .",
    "\\c ) if @xmath337 , @xmath338 ( the marching of proper time is even faster ) , such that @xmath339 , with @xmath340 ( dilation of the proper time ) . to illustrate this new effect of proper time dilation ,",
    "let us consider a box that contains an ideal gas with @xmath341 particles in the frame @xmath26 of a laboratory .",
    "since the minimum speed @xmath2 has a microscopic origin , then by considering an average speed per particle of the gas ( atom or molecule ) , we should have such average speed @xmath342 ( @xmath31 ) close to @xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) only when the temperature of the gas is @xmath343k ( @xmath344 ) .",
    "thus , an imaginary clock in thermal equilibrium with such ultra - cold system should measure a dilated time interval with respect to the time interval measured in the observer s clock ( laboratory @xmath26 ) , or in other words , we could say that ultra - cold systems  grow old \" more rapidly , contrary to higher energies when one grows old more slowly . a great experimental effort should be made in order to detect the effect of proper time dilation , but , before this , we must search for the origin of the invariant minimum speed .    , while the vertical leg represents the temporal - speed @xmath345 ( marching of time ) , where @xmath346 ( see eq.(27 ) ) , so that we always have @xmath347 . in sr , when @xmath24 , the horizontal leg vanishes ( no spatial speed ) and so the vertical leg becomes maximum ( @xmath348 ) .",
    "however , now according to ssr , due to the existence of a minimum limit of spatial speed ( @xmath2 ) , we can never nullify the horizontal leg , so that the maximum temporal speed ( maximum vertical leg ) is @xmath349 . on the other hand @xmath345 ( the vertical leg ) can not be zero since @xmath13 is forbidden for massive particles .",
    "so we conclude that the rectangular triangle is always preserved since both temporal and spatial speeds can not vanish and , thus , they always coexist . in this sense",

    "actually the newtonian notion about inertia as the resistance to acceleration ( @xmath503 ) is not compatible with the relativistic dynamics ( @xmath507 ) in the sense that we generally can not consider @xmath508 .",
    "the dynamics of ssr aims to give us a new interpretation for the inertia of the newtonian point of view in order to make it compatible with the relativistic mass .",
    "this compatibility will be possible just due to the influence of the background field that couples to the particle and  dresses \" its relativistic mass in order to generate an effective ( dressed ) mass in accordance with the newtonian notion about inertia from eq.(61 ) and eq.(62 ) .",
    "this issue will be clarified in this section .    from eq.(62 ) , it is important to observe that , when we are closer to @xmath2 , there emerges a completely new result ( correction ) for power , namely :    @xmath509    given in the approximation @xmath103 .",

    "therefore , from a dynamical point of view , the negative exponent @xmath514 ( @xmath515 ) for the power at very low speeds ( eq.(63 ) ) is responsible for the inferior barrier of the minimum speed @xmath2 , as well as the exponent @xmath500 of the well - known relativistic power is responsible for the top barrier of the speed of light @xmath12 according to newton second law . actually , due to the drastic increase of @xmath516 of a particle moving closer to @xmath10 , leading to its strong coupling to the vacuum field in the background frame @xmath10 , thus , in view of this , the dynamics of ssr states that it is impossible to decelerate a subatomic particle until reaching the rest .    in order to see clearly both exponents @xmath513 ( inferior inertial barrier @xmath2 ) and",

    "the discrepancy between the  relativistic mass \" ( energy @xmath510 of the particle ) and such an effective inertial mass ( @xmath516 ) can be interpreted under ssr theory , as follows : @xmath516 is a dressed inertial mass given in response to the presence of the vacuum-@xmath10 that works like a kind of  fluid \" in which the particle @xmath450 is immersed , while the  relativistic mass \" in ssr ( eq.(42 ) ) works like a bare inertial mass in the sense that it is not considered to be under the dynamical influence of the  fluid \" connected to the vacuum-@xmath10 .",

    "shows that the whole dressed mass has purely origin from the energy of vacuum-@xmath10 , with @xmath532 being the pure increment @xmath524 , since the bare ( relativistic ) mass @xmath506 of the own particle almost vanishes in such a regime ( @xmath103 ) , and thus an inertial effect only due to the vacuum (  fluid\")-@xmath10 remains .",

    "such a divergence of the dressed mass has origin from the dilation factor @xmath538 for this regime when @xmath103 , so that we can rewrite eq.(68 ) in the following way : @xmath539 .",
    "that is essentially the dynamical explanation why the particle can not reach the rest in ssr theory so that the background frame of the vacuum-@xmath10 becomes unattainable for any particle at quantum level .",

    "the first barrier ( @xmath2 ) is exclusively due to the vacuum-@xmath10 , being interpreted as a barrier of pure vacuum energy . in this regime",
    "we have the following approximations : @xmath542 and @xmath543 ( see fig.4 ) , so that @xmath544 and @xmath545 when @xmath11 . the second barrier ( @xmath12 )",

    "now it is important to notice that a particle moving in one spatial dimension ( @xmath470 ) goes only to right or to left , since the unattainable minimum limit of speed @xmath2 prevents it to reach the rest in view of the rapid increase of its dressed mass ( eq.(68 ) ) .",
    "so we can not stop the motion and return in the same spatial dimension @xmath470 . on the other hand , in a complementary and symmetric way to @xmath2 , the limit @xmath12 , which represents the temporal aspect of the space - time , prevents to stop the marching of the time ( @xmath551 ) , and so avoiding to come back to the past .",
    "in short , we perceive that the basic ingredient of the space - time structure in ssr , namely the @xmath33 space - time , presents @xmath470 and @xmath552 in equal - footing in the sense that both of them are irreversible once the particle is moving only to right or to left .",

    "so , ssr theory is able to provide the reason why we must have more than one ( @xmath558 ) spatial dimension for representing movement in reality @xmath171 , although we could have only one ( @xmath558 ) spatial dimension just as a good practical approximation for the case of classical space - time as in sr theory ( e.g.:a ball moving in a rectilinear path ) .",

    "now , as we are interested only in obtaining @xmath562 in absence of matter , i.e. , the vacuum limit connected to the ultra - referential @xmath10 , we perform the limit of eq.(71 ) as follows : @xmath564    from eq.(71 ) , we notice that the term @xmath565 for representing matter naturally vanishes in the limit of vacuum-@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and therefore just the contribution of vacuum prevails . as we always must have @xmath566 , we get @xmath567 in eq.(72 ) .",

    "<S> the paper aims to provide an explanation for the tiny value of the cosmological constant and the low vacuum energy density to represent the dark energy . to accomplish this , </S>",
    "<S> we will search for a fundamental principle of symmetry in space - time by means of the elimination of the classical idea of rest , by including an invariant minimum limit of speed in the subatomic world . </S>",
    "<S> such a minimum speed , unattainable by particles , represents a preferred reference frame associated with a background field that breaks down the lorentz symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the metric of the flat space - time shall include the presence of a uniform vacuum energy density , which leads to a negative pressure at cosmological length scales . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the equation of state for the cosmological constant [ @xmath0(pressure)@xmath1 ( energy density ) ] naturally emerges from such a space - time with an energy barrier of a minimum speed . </S>",
    "<S> the tiny values of the cosmological constant and the vacuum energy density will be successfully obtained , being in agreement with the observational results of perlmutter , schmidt and riess . </S>"
