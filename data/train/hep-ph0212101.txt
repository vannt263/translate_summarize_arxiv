    "<S> we can summarize their general form by quoting the form of total cross sections , from which the @xmath0 parameter is obtained via derivative dispersion relations . </S>",
    "<S> the ingredients are the contribution @xmath34 of the highest meson trajectories ( @xmath0 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) and the rising term @xmath38 for the pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 the first term is parametrised via regge theory , and we allow the lower trajectories to be partially non - degenerate , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ we allow one intercept for the @xmath40 trajectories , and another one for the @xmath41 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . a further lifting of the degeneracy is certainly possible , but does not seem to modify significantly the results @xcite . hence we use @xmath42 with @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of these trajectories is represented by rr . as for the pomeron term </S>",
    "<S> , we choose a combination of the following possibilities : @xmath44 \\label{pom2}\\\\ { \\textrm{h}}^{ab}&=&s\\left[b^{ab}\\ln^{2}\\left({s\\over s_1}\\right ) + p^{ab}\\right]\\label{pom3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 and @xmath45 to be determined by the fit . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of these terms is marked pe , pl and pl2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that the pole structure of the pomeron can not be directly obtained from these forms , as multiple poles at @xmath46 produce constant terms which mimic simple poles at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have considered several possible constraints on the parameters of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lower]-[pom3 ] ) :    * degeneracy of the reggeon trajectories @xmath47 , noted ( rr)@xmath48 ; * universality of rising terms ( @xmath49 independent of the hadrons ) , noted l2@xmath50 , l@xmath50 and e@xmath50 @xcite ; * factorization for the residues in the case of the @xmath22 and @xmath51 cross sections . if not otherwise indicated by the subscript @xmath52 , we impose @xmath53 ; * quark counting rules @xcite to predict the @xmath54 cross section from @xmath1 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , indicated by the subscript @xmath57 ; * johnson - treiman - freund @xcite relation for the cross section differences , noted @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> all possible variations of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lower]-[pom3 ] ) , using the above constraints , amount to 256 variants .    </S>",
    "<S> these variants are then fitted to the database , allowing for the minimum c.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy @xmath59 of the fit to vary between 3 and 10 gev . for @xmath60 gev , </S>",
    "<S> 33 variants have an overall @xmath61 if one fits only to total cross sections , whereas 21 obeyed this criterion when one includes the @xmath0 parameters in the data to be fitted to . </S>",
    "<S> one can try to lower the minimum energy of the fit , and one finds that for 11 models one can extend the minimum energy of the cross section fit to 4 gev , and that of the combined fit of @xmath62 and @xmath0 to 5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> several parametrisations based on triple poles ( rrpl2 ) , double poles ( rrpl ) or simple poles ( rrpe ) are kept . </S>",
    "<S> the only notable candidate which seems to be ruled out is the popular simple - pole model ( rre ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 nevertheless fall within our errors parameter from _ integral _ dispersion relations  </S>",
    "<S> see o.  v. selyugin s contribution to these proceedings . ] .    after this selection is made , the remaining models are ranked . </S>",
    "<S> we measure some characteristics of the fits , namely : the number of parameters , the confidence level in the considered region , the size of the region where the model achieves a @xmath63 and the value of that @xmath64 , the stability of the parameters when the minimum c.m . energy is changed , their stability with respect to the inclusion of the @xmath0 data , the uniformity of the @xmath64 for different processes and quantities , and finally the quality of the correlation matrix . </S>",
    "<S> all these features are important , and we have managed to measure them , introducing new statistical indicators @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the ideal fit would be the one with the least number of parameters , the biggest region of applicability , the best @xmath65 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , a single fit does not concentrate all these virtues . as </S>",
    "<S> the new indicators do not have ( yet ) a probabilistic interpretation and as all the parametrisations which fit are _ a priori _ acceptable , we choose the `` best '' model through a ranking procedure : for each feature , the models are ordered according to how well they perform . </S>",
    "<S> one then sums the position of each model for each indicator , and the model with least points is preferred . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this method , besides the fact that it automatically looks at many qualities of each fit , is that the best model is decided on the basis of automatic criteria , which do not depend on our own prejudice .    following that procedure </S>",
    "<S> , the triple - pole parametrisation rrp@xmath66l2@xmath50 @xcite gives the most satisfactory description of the data . </S>",
    "<S> this parameterization has a universal ( u ) @xmath67 term , a non - factorizing ( nf ) constant term and non - degenerate lower trajectories .    </S>",
    "<S> we are now in a position to evaluate several quantities of interest for future measurements . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , our best parametrisation can of course be used to predict @xmath62 and @xmath0 , with their statistical errors . </S>",
    "<S> we choose for this the parameters determined for a minimum c.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy @xmath68 gev . for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the central value of this fit gives @xmath69 with all coefficients in mb and @xmath15 in gev@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we assign errors by using the full error matrix @xmath70 from the fit , and define @xmath71 with @xmath72 or @xmath0 and @xmath73 the parameters of the model . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions are given in table [ table2 ] and the corresponding 1 @xmath74 region is shown as a dark band in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .     </S>",
    "<S> +   +    .predictions for @xmath62 and @xmath0 , for @xmath75 ( at @xmath76 gev ) and for @xmath1 ( all other energies ) . </S>",
    "<S> the central values and statistical errors correspond to the preferred model rrp@xmath66l2@xmath50 , fitted for @xmath68 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the first systematic errors come from the consideration of two choices between cdf and e-710/e-811 @xmath77 data in the simultaneous global fits . </S>",
    "<S> the second systematic error corresponds to the consideration of the 21 parametrisations compatible with existing data . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table3 ]    we can now , and maybe for the first time , give a reasonable estimate of the theoretical error . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to choose a less constraining minimum energy for the fits ( we take 9 gev ) , and to consider the results of the 21 models that succeed in reproducing both @xmath62 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us 21 predictions with error bars . </S>",
    "<S> we can then define the theoretical systematic error by taking the distance between the highest ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> lowest ) values in the @xmath78 intervals with the 1 @xmath74 central region . </S>",
    "<S> we give the resulting numbers as a third error in table [ table2 ] , and as the outer curves of figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the systematic errors can not be added in quadrature , and that the theoretical systematic error is an absolute shift from model to model , and does not have any probabilistic interpretation .    </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the errors on total cross sections are of the order of 1% at rhic , @xmath8 at the tevatron and as large as @xmath9 at the lhc . at rhic , </S>",
    "<S> the systematic errors dues to the tevatron discrepancy and those due to theory are of comparable order . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the cross section is constrained by the @xmath2 data , and by the fact that we allow only one @xmath41 contribution , which is well constrained by the overall fit . </S>",
    "<S> very precise rhic measurements , at the level of one in a thousand could shed light on the tevatron discrepancy , and discriminate between models . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the extrapolation to lhc energies presents the largest uncertainty and is dominated by systematic theoretical errors , with the double pole models ( rrpl ) giving a cross section significantly lower than the triple poles or the simple poles . </S>",
    "<S> a determination of the cross section at the 5% level could rule out one half of the models or the other .    </S>",
    "<S> the errors on the @xmath0 parameter are much larger , reaching 10@xmath79 at rhic , 17@xmath79 at the tevatron and 26@xmath79 at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that experimental errors are bigger , hence less constraining , but this also stems from the incompatibility of some low - energy determinations of @xmath0 @xcite , and from our use of derivative dispersion relations . </S>",
    "<S> although integral dispersion relations have the potential to reduce the @xmath64 , they have the inconvenient of introducing extra parameters ( because they necessitate subtractions ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is unlikely that a different theoretical treatment can reduce the errors . on the other hand , a re - analysis of some of the data could be envisaged . </S>",
    "<S> it should involve a combination of the information on total cross section with that on elastic hadronic cross sections , on electromagnetic form factors and on regge trajectories ( see v.  v. ezhela s contribution to these proceedings ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we can use the same approach to predict cross sections for cosmic photon studies . </S>",
    "<S> we show the results in table [ table3 ] , where we have given only the experimental systematic error .    to conclude , we believe that we have pushed the database technology to the point where it can make predictions , and decide on which models or theories are the best . </S>",
    "<S> this is an example proof of the feasibility of the compete program , and of its utility .    </S>",
    "<S> we have given here the best possible estimates for present and future @xmath1 and @xmath2 facilities . </S>",
    "<S> the central values of our fits and the corresponding statistical error give our `` best guess '' estimate . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic experimental errors tell us how much this guess could be affected by incompatible data . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical systematic errors will tell us directly whether an experiment can be fitted by one of the standard analytic parametrisations , or whether it calls for new ideas . </S>"
