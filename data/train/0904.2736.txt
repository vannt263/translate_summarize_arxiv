    "we briefly elaborate below on the theoretical implications of our results assuming that is indeed the gamma - ray counterpart of .    colliding wind binaries ( cwbs )",
    "are ideal systems to test theories of hydrodynamical shocks and particle acceleration under extreme radiative conditions provided by the proximity of the two stars .",
    "in particular , supersonic winds can form efficient shocks where electrons and protons can be accelerated through first - order fermi ( eichler & usov 1993 ) or other acceleration mechanisms .",
    "inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of shock - accelerated particles in the presence of the very intense ir - optical - uv background of the nearby very bright stars provides a crucial ingredient in cwbs .",
    "in addition to synchrotron and bremsstrahlung electron emissions , the ic emission can dominate the high energy spectrum at energies larger than several tens of kev up to mev - gev energies .",
    "furthermore , if protons are efficiently accelerated , they can interact with the dense stellar outflows and produce gamma - rays by pion production and neutral pion decay ( e.g. , eichler & usov 1993 , benaglia & romero 2003 ; reimer et al .",
    "all these ingredients are important for the system and detailed hydrodynamical modelling of the mass outflow have been developed @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive and detailed theoretical analysis of our data is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we outline here a few important points .",
    "if is the gamma - ray counterpart , our data show the first remarkable detection of a colliding wind system at hundreds of mev energies , confirming the efficient particle acceleration and the highly non - thermal nature of the strong shock in a cwb . the average gamma - ray flux of translates into gamma - ray luminosity of @xmath21 for an distance of 2.3 kpc , corresponding to a fraction of a percent of the total wind kinetic power .",
    "the 2008 oct .",
    "11 - 13 flare episode has a luminosity of @xmath22 .",
    "the average broad - band gamma - ray spectrum determined by agile is in qualitative agreement with expectations of cwb spectra as calculated for dominant ic and neutral pion decay processes @xcite .",
    "while the gamma - ray flux of is roughly constant during the time span covered by our observations , a significant variability was detected on a few day time - scale in october 2008 .",
    "this episode indicates that the gamma - ray emission can be associated with intermittent strong shock acceleration episodes and/or magnetic field enhancements to be expected for a very variable and inhomogeneous mass outflow from the stars of the system .",
    "in particular , we note that the strong gamma - ray flaring episode occurred a few months before periastron , when the efficiency of transforming a mass outflow enhancement into particle acceleration is expected to increase because of the closeness of the two stars .",
    "provides then some crucial ingredients regarding the formation of high - energy emission in cwbs : ( 1 ) strong variability of the mass outflows ; ( 2 ) a high - speed wind from the less massive companion ; ( 3 ) a radiative environment with a specific bath of soft photons from both stars ( ir , optical and uv fluxes ) that can illuminate the shock region and provide a time variable environment for enhanced ic emission in the 100 mev range and beyond .",
    "the theoretical implications are far reaching .",
    "the system would provide the first cwb to test the particle acceleration models for non - relativistic mass outflows under a specific set of physical conditions .",
    "it is very important to assess the efficiency of the particle acceleration process in such a radiative environment .",
    "a gamma - ray flaring episode lasting @xmath23 days implies a fast acceleration timescale and subsequent radiation and decay of the strong shock properties leading to the efficient emission .",
    "if the gamma - ray emission is associated with our observations provide important data to test shock acceleration models .",
    "future gamma - ray observations and analysis will further contribute to enlighten the emission mechanism and the ultimate origin of ."
