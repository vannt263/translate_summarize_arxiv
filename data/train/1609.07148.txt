    "in the last few years , the number of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) identified in dwarf galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) has grown from a handful of quintessential examples ( e.g. , ngc 4395 ; @xcite , and pox 52 ; @xcite ) to a body of several hundred candidates ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this has largely been possible thanks to large scale optical spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , the sloan digital sky survey ; sdss ) , which have facilitated the search for agn signatures in samples of tens of thousands of galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) , with the most recent studies concentrating on _ bona - fide _ dwarf galaxies @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the most successful searches for agn in dwarf galaxies have used narrow emission line diagnostics ( e.g. , the bpt diagram ; baldwin , phillips & terlevich 1989 ) to search for photo - ionized gas consistent with the presence of an agn ( see also @xcite for commonly used diagnostics ) .    for agn exhibiting broad h@xmath1 emission , assuming that the broad line region gas is virialized , it is possible to estimate the mass of the central bhs .",
    "note that , for agn in dwarf galaxies , this also relies on the assumption that the scaling relation between bh mass and host stellar velocity dispersion @xcite holds in this mass regime @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the broad line region gas is estimated from the width of the h@xmath1 line , and the radius to the broad line region is estimated from the luminosity of the broad emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "bh masses in dwarf agn are typically @xmath10 solar masses ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , with the lowest reported having a mass of just @xmath11 @xcite .    despite these recent advances in the identification of agn in dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the radiative properties of this population of agn as a whole are largely unconstrained .",
    "much work has been done exploring the x - ray properties of @xmath12 optically selected agn from the greene & ho samples @xcite , but these host galaxies tend to be more massive than the dwarf galaxies considered here .",
    "stacking analyses have been used to detect x - ray emission in dwarf galaxies out to z @xmath13 1.5 @xcite .",
    "additionally @xcite used x - ray observations to search for agn in dwarf galaxies at z @xmath14 , finding an agn fraction of @xmath15 .",
    "however , we are concerned with following up individual systems in order to obtain a detailed look at the radiative properties of this relatively unexplored population .",
    "determining the radiation properties of actively accreting bhs at the cores of dwarf galaxies is important for several reasons .",
    "firstly , the bhs at the centers of dwarf galaxies may provide clues about galaxy nuclei in the early universe , since they are expected to be similar ( to first approximation ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) . with current instrumentation , it is not possible to detect @xmath16 bhs in the earliest galaxies .",
    "a bh of this size accreting at its eddington limit has a bolometric luminosity of @xmath17 . assuming it releases @xmath18 of its energy in hard x - rays ,",
    "the flux reaching us would be an order of magnitude below the detection limit of the 4 ms chandra deep field south ( which has a 2 - 8 kev flux limit of @xmath19 ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , searches for agn at high redshift ( z @xmath20 ) find fewer sources than expected based on relations at lower redshift @xcite , possibly due to the lower normalization for low - mass galaxies in the bh mass - galaxy stellar mass relation @xcite . as an alternative , present - day dwarf galaxies can serve as useful local analogs @xcite .",
    "present day dwarf galaxies have likely not undergone any major mergers , and are thus relatively undisturbed and  pristine \" compared to more massive systems .",
    "moreover , studying agn in dwarf galaxies is useful for understanding the interplay between agn activity and star formation on all galaxy scales .",
    "agn feedback is expected to have an effect on galaxy scale star formation , particularly in more massive systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "feedback from massive stars and/or supernovae is expected to be particularly relevant for dwarf galaxies , but it is unclear what ( if any ) influence agn can have on star formation in these smaller systems @xcite . studying radiation from agn in dwarf galaxies is also useful for understanding whether bh accretion had any influence on star formation in the earliest galaxies ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as for investigating the contribution of low luminosity agn to reionization @xcite .",
    "high resolution x - ray and uv follow - up of these systems is essential for understanding the accretion properties of agn in dwarf galaxies .",
    "if detected , sufficiently bright , point - like nuclear uv / x - ray emission provides strong confirmation of the presence of an agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , x - ray studies can be used to determine the distribution of eddington ratios for agn in dwarf galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the relative strength of the uv and x - ray emission is important for learning about the structure and properties of the accretion disk and corona ( @xcite ) . finally , studies of the broad - band spectra of these objects is necessary for determining the bolometric correction for this class of agn .",
    "reines et al .",
    "( 2013 ) identified 151 dwarf galaxies with narrow and/or broad emission line signatures indicating the presence of an agn . with the above goals in mind ,",

    "counts were converted to unabsorbed fluxes using the portable , interactive multi - mission simulator ( pimms ) .",

    "also note that the 3@xmath27 sdss fiber is larger than the 2@xmath27 _ chandra _ psf , so we are calculating the expected contribution from hmxbs over a slightly larger area than necessary .",

    "we stress again that the sfrs used are conservative upper limits , and that the actual star formation rates are lower for objects falling in the composite or agn region of the bpt diagram .        with the exception of rgg b ( and rgg 32 in the hard band ) , the x - ray luminosities of our targets are higher than would be expected from star formation . for our seven targets with with broad",

    "optical spectroscopy of rgg b was also analyzed in @xcite , which carried out multi - epoch spectroscopy of star - forming dwarf galaxies with broad h@xmath1 .",
    "they found that the broad h@xmath1 faded in most , indicating the broad emission was likely produced by a transient stellar process for those targets .",
    "rgg b was classified as ambiguous with respect to the presence of broad h@xmath1 in spectra taken several years following the sdss spectrum .",
    "however , even if the broad emission in the sdss spectrum of rgg b is produced by an agn , we can not say with certainty that the observed nuclear x - ray emission is not associated with a hmxb .",
    "we emphasize that more than a third of our sample falls in the composite region of the bpt diagram .",
    "though bpt star forming objects with broad h@xmath1 are not necessarily agn , this work provides strong evidence to suggest that the composite objects do indeed host agn .",
    "below , we compare the properties of the agn considered in this paper to the properties of more massive quasars , as well as to the properties of the @xcite and @xcite samples of low - mass agn ( i.e. @xmath87 ) .",

    "we note that our two brightest , highest @xmath92 targets ( rgg 119 and 127 ) have @xmath93 , consistent with the @xcite relation .",
    "as discussed at length in @xcite , there are several factors which can influence @xmath7 . in the disk ,",
    "uv photons are inverse - compton scattered into an x - ray corona .",
    "the temperature of the disk therefore influences how much disk energy is reprocessed in this manner .",
    "if the disk extends to the innermost stable circular orbit , the peak disk temperature is dependent on bh mass such that smaller bhs have hotter disks .",
    "the disk temperature can also be dependent on the accretion rate .",
    "additionally , the structure of the disk , i.e. , whether the disk is thin or slim , can influence @xmath7 .",
    "finally , absorption can lead to suppressed uv emission and a harder overall spectrum .",
    "@xcite combine their sample of low - mass agn with more massive agn in order to explore trends between @xmath7 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "they find @xmath7 is not correlated at all with @xmath94 .",
    "however , they find a potential trend between @xmath7 and @xmath95 such that the mean @xmath7 decreases ( becomes more negative ) with increasing @xmath95 .",
    "this is expected to be due to the blackbody temperature of the accretion disk increasing with decreasing bh mass ( for a given mass accretion rate ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the accretion disk temperature is also expected to rise with increasing mass accretion rate .",
    "the mean @xmath7 for our targets with @xmath96 does not follow the trend noted by @xcite , i.e. , the mean @xmath7 is more negative than for the objects with @xmath97 ( though we reiterate that our sample size is small ) .",
    "additionally , there appears to be a potential trend between @xmath7 and @xmath94 for our sample ; the objects with the highest eddington fractions also have the least negative @xmath7 values ( see figure  [ alpha_ox ] )",
    ". a larger sample size would aid in determining whether the disk properties of agn in dwarf galaxies are indeed distinct from those of more massive objects .",
