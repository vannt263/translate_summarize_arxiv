    "@xmath68 the lifetime of an agn depends on how much mass it accretes during each episode .",
    "given the initial mass of a smbh , @xmath67 , and the amount of mass it accretes , we can calculate its final mass , @xmath75 , at the end of the active phase ( equation 4 ) . for a given eddington fraction , @xmath74",
    ", the mass of the smbh grows with time as : m_fin = m_in ( f_edd ) where @xmath58 is the radiative efficiency ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath77 gyr ( @xmath78 is the speed of light , @xmath79 is the thomson cross section , @xmath80 is the proton mass ) . given @xmath67 and @xmath75 , then a smbh is active for a time @xmath81 .",
    "note that the un - regulated prescription ( a smbh mass doubles at each accretion episode ) corresponds to assuming that all smbhs shine as agn for the same time at a fixed accretion rate ( e.g. , 100 myr for an accretion rate @xmath30 ) .    in summary",
    ", we study and compare two self - regulated models ( pop iii , @xmath82 ; d.c . , @xmath30 ) and two unregulated models ( pop iii , @xmath29 , @xmath31 ; d.c . , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "we use these models to derive the mass density in black holes in a cosmic volume , by summing over all existing black holes at a given redshift and normalizing by the comoving volume .",
    "we also calculate number counts ( figure 2 in the main article ) imposing selection criteria that match the observations we have analyzed .",
    "the limiting luminosity is @xmath83  erg  s@xmath7 for the stacked sample , i.e. , if all the galaxies are emitting at this limit then we should detect them in the stack . for a single source ,",
    "the more appropriate limit is this value multiplied by the number of sources in the stack , which is equivalent to a single source contributing all the signal . in that case , the luminosity limit is @xmath84  erg  s@xmath7 and the flux limit is @xmath85  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath7 . in that case , the source will be individually detected .",
    "we therefore select all accreting black holes in the theoretical sample at @xmath86 that meet this flux criterion . from the eddington ratio we calculate the bolometric luminosity and then apply a k - correction of 25 to derive the x - ray flux at the appropriate redshift .",
    "we first compare the observational results presented with the expectations from integrating existing measurements or extrapolations of the observed agn luminosity functions from earlier work . integrating the hard x - ray lf@xcite from @xmath3=7 to 10",

    "comparison of observations of the accreted smbh mass density with predictions obtained from extrapolations of existing agn luminosity functions to high redshifts and/or low luminosities provides contrasting results .",
    "while there is in general good agreement up to @xmath3@xmath83 , differences of up to @xmath82 orders of magnitude are found at @xmath3@xmath06 .",
    "this can be explained as the luminosity functions of hopkins et al.@xcite and willott et al.@xcite incorporate a density evolution of the form 10@xmath87 , which is required to account for the observed evolution of the highest luminosity quasars at @xmath3@xmath85 - 6 in the sdss@xcite .",
    "a similarly steep evolution from @xmath3@xmath83 to @xmath3@xmath85 has been reported , based on a compilation of _ chandra _ x - ray observations@xcite .",
    "however , it is worth pointing out that the accreted smbh mass density inferred from this lf , presented in figure  s[bhmass_w_z ] is significantly lower than observations and other lfs at all redshifts , which may be explained by the relatively high spectroscopic incompleteness ( @xmath850% ) of this sample .",

    ", the contribution from high - luminosity sources to the integrated accreted black hole mass density will be very small , @xmath81 - 2% .",
    "alternatively , the observed results could be explained if the relative number of heavily - obscured quasars increases strongly with redshift , as measured up to @xmath3@xmath283@xcite .",
    "two sources of uv radiation are expected to contribute to re - ionization : star forming galaxies and quasars@xcite .",
    "the conventional view is that galaxies dominate hydrogen re - ionization occurring at high redshift@xcite , @xmath88 , and quasars dominate helium re - ionization occurring at a later time , @xmath89@xcite .",
    "this result is based on optically - selected quasar luminosity functions@xcite that show , as discussed in the previous section , a steep drop of the quasar population at @xmath3@xmath04@xcite . however , in ab initio models of black hole evolution through cosmic history@xcite the amount of black hole growth required to explain the bright end of the luminosity function of quasars at @xmath90 implies a substantial contribution of quasars to hydrogen re - ionization , provided that uv and x - ray radiation can escape into the intergalactic medium .",
    "our findings resolve this tension , as regardless of the amount of accretion occurring onto black holes , the bulk of the emission from the population is obscured , and uv photons can not escape . in 4@xmath44 compton thick sources",
    "only the highest energy photons can escape .",
    "we provide a simple estimate here of the contribution of compton thick quasars to re - ionization . from our models",
    "we can extract information on @xmath91 , the accreted mass density on black holes as a function of cosmic time ( figure 1 in the main article shows the integral quantity ) .",
    "let us assume , optimistically , that an escape fraction @xmath92 of the bolometric luminosity ( here we just assume @xmath93 ) goes into hard x - ray photons with mean energy @xmath94 kev that can escape from the quasar host .",
    "all these photons contribute to primary and secondary ionizations .",

    "@xmath98 , as long as @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is less than unity in all our models down to @xmath101 .    the number of ionizing photons per hydrogen atom is shown in the accompanying figure  s[reion_ct ] , where we see that models that successfully reproduce our observations * fail * to reionize hydrogen by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude at @xmath1026 , notwithstanding significant black hole growth . without taking obscuration into account ,",
    "these accreting black holes would contribute substantially to re - ionization , producing one ionizing photon per atom by @xmath103@xcite .",
    "however , we stress here that if quasars do not contribute to hydrogen re - ionization , it is not because quasar activity drops steeply at @xmath3@xmath04 as previously suggested@xcite , but instead due to the presence of obscuring material that absorbs uv and soft x - ray radiation .",
    "as seen in figure  s[reion_ct ] , the models that are consistent with the observations at @xmath3@xmath06 and include self - regulation under - produce ionizing photons at these epochs . hence , re - ionization of the early universe is most likely due to star forming galaxies and not growing black holes .",
    "however , this is still vigourously debated . as previously shown@xcite , observed @xmath3@xmath87 galaxies can not provide enough hydrogen - ionizing photons unless some of the galaxy properties , such as escape fraction , metallicity , initial stellar mass function or dust extinction , evolve significantly from @xmath3@xmath87 to the local universe .",

    "we start by assuming that all sources are equally bright in the x - rays , with count rate @xmath104 , @xmath105 in cts / ms in the soft and hard bands , respectively .",
    "the background levels in _ chandra _ for the acis - i detectors as measured in the cdf - s 4 msec data are @xmath106=0.049 cts / ms / pixel in the soft band and @xmath107=0.160 cts / ms / pixel in the hard one , in good agreement with the values of 0.066 cts / ms / pixel ( soft ) , and 0.167 cts / ms / pixel ( hard ) measured in the cdf - s 2 msec data@xcite .",
    "the background level was found to vary by @xmath85% ( standard deviation ) across the field . to account for this",
    ", the background value was determined for each source independently by measuring the average count rate on a annulus around the source position with inner radius 2@xmath41 , where @xmath41 is the aperture radius in pixels and outer radius fixed to 22@xmath34 .",
    "a 3-@xmath10 clipping was used for the background determination .",
    "then , an aperture of radius @xmath41 pixels has area @xmath44@xmath108 and hence background counts @xmath109@xmath44@xmath108@xmath110 where @xmath110 stands for the average of the exposure time @xmath111 over all pixels inside this aperture around the kth source and @xmath109 is the background level for that source .",
    "the signal contained within this aperture can be found by interpolating the enclosed energy profiles , which give us the values of @xmath41 corresponding to various fractions @xmath112 of @xmath113 as a function of offaxis angle @xmath114 , e.g. @xmath115 .",
    "we interpolate between these curves to determine the desired function , @xmath116 , producing a expected signal for the @xmath117th source of @xmath118 .",
    "we assume that the noise receives poisson contributions from both the background and the object counts , @xmath119 .",
    "hence the signal - to - noise is given by      for each source , we choose the value of @xmath41 that maximizes this function . in our case",
    ", each individual source is dim enough that background fluctuations dominate the noise , and assuming that @xmath111 is slowly varying , the function to be maximized is just @xmath121 .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath41 as a function of off - axis angle for the soft and hard bands are shown in figure  s[opt_rad_angle ] .",
    "a minimum radius of 1@xmath34 was assumed in order to avoid flux losses due to astrometric problems and pixel aliasing .",
    "we will stack the estimated source count rates , @xmath122 , rather than the observed source counts , @xmath123 , since the latter depends on the psf and exposure time at each source position but the former does not .",
    "this is superior to performing photometry on the stacked image , which requires using a constant aperture for all sources .",
    "the standard technique in the literature of performing photometry on the stacked image and dividing by the number of sources is both sub - optimal and biased ; the bias could be fixed by instead dividing by the effective number of sources given the psf and exposure information .    while a straightforward averaging ( `` stack '' ) of the source count rates is unbiased , it is still not optimal because it gives equal weight to each count rate even though some were measured with lower snr .",
    "we can derive the weights that optimize @xmath124 of the combined stack by noting that the combined stack will have @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( since the weighted sum is just an unweighted sum of new objects with signal @xmath127 and noise @xmath128@xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the optimal weight is then @xmath129 which has the required behavior that multiplying all the weights by a constant @xmath117 preserves the final @xmath124 .",
    "hence the optimal weights cause @xmath124 to add in quadrature so it will never formally decrease .",
    "however , in practice there is little benefit to including objects that offer individual @xmath124 of less than 10% of the typical objects in the field , which is why we only stacked sources closer than 9@xmath33 from the average _ chandra _ aim point ."

    "<S> alternatively , it can not be claimed that rapid and efficient supermassive black hole growth in the high - z universe is implausible on the basis of any re - ionization constraints@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if most of the high - redshift black hole growth is indeed obscured as suggested by our work , several current constraints on the lifetime and duty cycle of high - z accreting black holes need to be revisited and revised .    </S>",

    "<S> second , at higher luminosities , the extrapolation of lower - redshift agn luminosity functions leads to an overestimate of the observed source density in optical surveys@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy can be resolved if the shape of the agn luminosity function evolves strongly in the sense that there are relatively fewer high - luminosity agn at @xmath3@xmath06 in comparison to the @xmath3@xmath183 population . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is that the number of obscured sources , relative to unobscured quasars , increases with redshift , such that most of the highly obscured systems are systematically missed in these optical studies . </S>",
    "<S> this is strongly supported by observations of quasars at lower redshifts , @xmath3@xmath183@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can not rule out either of these scenarios at present due to the relatively small cosmological volume studied , in which the extremely rare high - luminosity agn are absent .    </S>",
    "<S> our measurements and upper limits for the accreted black hole mass density up to @xmath3@xmath88.5 ( @xmath8600 million years after the big bang ) constrain the nature of black hole growth in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> two critical issues for agn and the supermassive black holes powering them are how the first black holes formed , and how they subsequently grew accreting mass while shining as agn . </S>",

    "<S> the origin of the initial `` seed '' black holes remains an unsolved problem at present . </S>",
    "<S> two channels to form these seeds have been proposed : compact remnants of the first stars , the so - called population iii stars@xcite , which generate seeds with masses @xmath810 - 1,000 m@xmath19 and from the direct gravitational collapse of gas - rich pre - galactic disks , which leads to significantly more massive seeds with masses in the range @xmath20@xmath810@xmath21  @xmath22@xcite . by construction </S>",
    "<S> , the masses of seeds that form from direct collapse are correlated to properties of the dark matter halo and hence properties of the galaxy that will assemble subsequently .    to interpret our finding , we explore a theoretical framework for the cosmic evolution of supermassive black holes in a @xmath23cdm cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the formation and evolution of black holes through dedicated monte carlo merger tree simulations . </S>",
    "<S> each model is constructed by tracing the merger hierarchy of dark matter halos in the mass range @xmath24 backwards to @xmath25 , using an extended press & schechter algorithm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the halos are then seeded with black holes and their evolution is tracked forward to the present time . following a major merger ( defined as a merger between two halos with mass ratio @xmath26 ) , supermassive black holes accrete efficiently an amount of mass that is set by a  self - regulated \" model ( where the accreted mass scales with the fourth power of the host halo circular velocity and is normalized to reproduce the observed local correlation between supermassive black hole mass and velocity dispersion ) or a  un - regulated \" model , where the supermassive black hole simply doubles in mass at each accretion episode . </S>",
    "<S> see the supplementary information for additional details .    </S>",
    "<S> our observational results provide strong support for the existence of a correlation between supermassive black holes and their hosts out to the highest redshifts . in figure 1 , we compare both unregulated and self - regulated black hole growth models with our observations , and find that physically motivated self - regulation growth models are highly favored at all redshifts , even in the very early universe . </S>",
    "<S> un - regulated models ( for instance wherein black holes just double in mass at each major merger ) are strongly disfavored by the data . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that even in the first episodes of black hole growth there is a fundamental link between galaxy and black hole mass assembly .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure 1 , once a standard prescription for self - regulation ( as described before ) is incorporated , both seed models are consistent with our current high - z observations . </S>",
    "<S> detection of an unbiased population of sources at these early epochs is the one metric that we have in the foreseeable future to distinguish between these two scenarios for the origin of supermassive black holes in the universe . in figure 2 , we present the predicted cumulative source counts at @xmath3@xmath06 for the models studied here . based on these models , ultra - deep x - ray and near - infrared surveys covering at least @xmath81 deg@xmath27 are required to constrain the formation of the first black hole seeds . </S>",
