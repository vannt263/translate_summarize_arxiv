    "frustrated antiferromagnets on the kagome lattice have attracted great research interest recently .",
    "the ground state of a spin-1/2 kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet ( khaf ) has been disclosed to be a disordered state without any spontaneous symmetry breaking , i.e. , a quantum spin liquid .",
    "@xcite however , less is known for the higher - spin khaf models ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "numerical studies on the khaf models with spin magnitude up to @xmath3 showed that , @xcite while long - range magnetic order appears for @xmath4 , the ground states for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 khaf models remain non - magnetic .",
    "experimentally , a number of spin-1 kagome compounds have been synthesized and analyzed , e.g. , m - mpynn@xmath7bf@xmath8@xcite and ni@xmath9v@xmath10o@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the former has been found to be non - magnetic even at very low temperatures ( 30mk),@xcite and a spin gap has also been observed.@xcite this thus raises an interesting question : do spin-1 kagome antiferromagnets also support an intriguing spin liquid ground state ?",
    "various spin liquid proposals have been put forward for the spin-1 frustrated antiferromagnet.@xcite for the spin-1 khaf model , hida proposed a hexagon - singlet solid ( hss ) state as a candidate ground state .",
    "@xcite this state is constructed by projecting two virtual spin-1/2 particles around each vertex of the kagome lattice into physical spin-1 degrees of freedom .",
    "the name hss refers to the fact that the six virtual spin-1/2 s in a hexagon of the kagome lattice form an entangled singlet [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : hss](a ) ] .",
    "an alternative candidate is the spin-1 resonating affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki loop ( ral ) state [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : ral](b)].@xcite the physical picture of the ral state is the following : when representing the spin-1 s in each site as two spin-1/2 s ( through symmetrization ) , the spin-1/2 s from neighboring sites all form valence - bond singlets and , thus , each site has two valence bonds , which inevitably form closed aklt loops @xcite .",
    "the ral state is an _",
    "equal _ weight superposition of _ all _ possible aklt loops . on the kagome lattice",
    ", it belongs to a @xmath12 spin liquid .",
    "@xcite compared to the hss ansatz , the ral has a lower variational energy ( for the spin-1 khaf model ) on small clusters ; while in the thermodynamic limit , the energy per site is clearly higher , @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite    very recently , several extensive numerical studies have been devoted to the spin-1 khaf model , exploring its ground state properties .",
    "changlani and luchli ( cl ) @xcite employed the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite to simulate the model with cylindrical geometries ; at the same time , liu _ _ et al.__@xcite adopted tensor network methods@xcite to explore the same model on an infinitely large kagome lattice and also on infinitely long cylinders with various widths .",
    "these independent calculations , as well as another related tensor network simulation by picot and poilblanc,@xcite concluded that the ground state of the spin-1 khaf is non - magnetic , but that it breaks lattice inversion symmetry and possesses a simplex valence - bond crystal ( svbc ) order .",
    "the simplex valence bond crystal is a non - magnetic state that favors trimerization,@xcite in that the energies ( per triangle ) differ between two neighoring triangles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : svbc ] ) .",
    "the energy per site of this svbc state was determined as @xmath14 , in both dmrg and tensor network calculations.@xcite        even more recently , nishimoto and nakamura ( nn14 ) @xcite came to a different conclusion : based on dmrg calculations for clusters of various types of shapes and boundary conditions , they argued that the ground state of the spin-1 khaf model is a hss state and not the svbc state advocated in refs .  .",
    "however , nn14 were not able to directly access states with hss or svbc structure ; instead they sought to access them indirectly , using purposefully - designed boundary conditions that favor either hss or svbc structure .",
    "they then estimated the bulk values of @xmath15 by finite - size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "they reported @xmath16 from svbc - favoring clusters , @xmath17 and @xmath18 from clusters with cylindrical or periodic boundary conditions , respectively , and @xmath19 from hss - favoring clusters , thus concluding that hss states win .    in our opinion , nn14 s strategy is intrinsically flawed on very general grounds : in the thermodynamic limit boundary effects should vanish , thus a tool ( here ground - state dmrg on finite - sized clusters ) that _ relies on boundary effects _ to distinguish two types of states ( here hss and svbc ) , can not reliably estimate the difference in _ bulk _ @xmath15 values for these two types of states .",
    "if different boundary choices lead to different finite - size extrapolated @xmath15 values , it just means that the clusters are not yet large enough to reliably capture the true bulk @xmath15 value of the true ground state , whatever it is .",
    "( more detailed comments on nn14 s work are presented in appendix  [ app : critique ] . )    to reliably access the bulk properties of hss - type states for the spin-1 khaf , tools are needed that directly implement hss structure in the variational candidate ground state , without relying on boundary effects . in this work ,",
    "we devise two such tools , one analytical , the other numerical , and use them to perform a systematic investigation of hss states .",
    "our analytical tool is a formulation of the hss ansatz in terms of su(2 ) schwinger bosons . in the schwinger boson picture , we are able to argue that the hss states have exponentially decaying correlation functions and thus describe gapped spin liquids . furthermore , we also reveal that the hss states have a hidden resonating aklt - loop picture .",
    "however , we show that they have zero topological entanglement entropy,@xcite concluding that they are topologically trivial and thus do not belong to the same phase as the ral state .",
    "our numerical tool is a compact tensor network representation of the hss ansatz , with which we perform accurate tensor - network - based simulations .",
    "the weights of different hexagon - singlet configurations within a hexagon are treated as variational parameters to seek the lowest possible variational energy for the spin-1 khaf model .",
    "it is found to be as low as @xmath20 , which is significantly higher than the reported ground state energy @xmath21 of the svbc state.@xcite moreover , we mimic a single step of imaginary - time evolution ( on one of the two kinds of triangles ) , and thus add one additional parameter @xmath22 .",
    "this gives a clear gain in energy ( @xmath1 ) , for a state breaking the lattice symmetry between two neighboring triangles .",
    "this variational calculation indicates that the hss state , which does not break any lattice symmetry , may not be energetically favorable for the spin-1 khaf model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : hss ] we introduce the hss ansatz in terms of the schwinger boson representation . in secs .",
    "[ sec : tensor ] and [ sec : variational ] we show a compact tensor network representation for the hss states , and use it to calculate the physical quantities , including the variational energy for the spin-1 khaf model and various correlation functions .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the summary and discussions .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the hexagon - singlet solid ansatz .",
    "@xcite we start in sec .",
    "[ subsec : sb ] by introducing the construction of the hss ansatz in terms of schwinger bosons , and then provide a physical picture of resonating aklt loops for these states in sec . [ subsec : ral ] .      the hexagon - singlet solid ansatz for the spin-1 kagome antiferromagnet bears similarity to the construction of the 1d spin-1 aklt state.@xcite for each physical spin-1 site , one associates two virtual spin-1/2 particles .",
    "since the kagome lattice can be viewed as a lattice with corner - sharing hexagons , each hexagon contains six virtual spin-1/2 particles [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : hss](a ) ] . on each hexagon ,",
    "the six virtual spin-1/2 particles are combined into a su(2 ) spin singlet .",
    "the final step is to recover a physical spin-1 wave function by symmetrizing the two virtual spin-1/2 s in the same lattice site into the spin-1 subspace .",
    "in contrast to ordinary aklt states , there exist inequivalent singlet configurations per hexagon ( depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : benzene ] ) .",
    "therefore , this construction provides a class of trial wave functions for the spin-1 kagome antiferromagnet .     is with @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) sign convention in the superposition .",
    "( b ) an allowed dimer pattern @xmath25 with _ longer - range _ valence bonds in the hexagon .",
    "the arrow orientates from the first to the second spins in a singlet , which is anti - symmetric towards permutation of the two constituting spin-1/2 s . notice that these three hexagon singlets are all eigenstates of hexagon - inversion symmetry : @xmath26 and @xmath25 are odd ( eigenvalue @xmath27 ) , while @xmath28 is even ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 and @xmath25 are all one - dimensional irreducible representations of the point group @xmath31 . ]",
    "degrees to the vertical ( denoted by dashed lines ) , it is only possible to intersect an even number of valence bonds .",
    "( b ) a typical ral configuration , shown for comparison .",
    "the ral state has four virtual particles @xmath32 on each vertex [ see more details in ref . ] , which is a fully packed equal weight superposition of _ all _ possible loops , thus contains some configurations which are prohibited in the hss state .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed on both horizontal and vertical directions . ]",
    "formally , it is convenient to formulate the hss ansatz in terms of schwinger bosons.@xcite in schwinger boson language , the su(2 ) spin operators for each site @xmath33 are represented as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are pauli matrices .",
    "on each site , a boson number constraint , @xmath36 , has to be imposed to guarantee the physical spin-1 hilbert space . here",
    "the bosonic statistics takes care of the symmetrization of two virtual spin-1/2 s into a spin-1 and , in terms of schwinger bosons , the three spin-1 states are represented as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the vacuum of the schwinger bosons .    by using the schwinger bosons , the hss state is written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 creates a singlet state formed by six spin-1/2 schwinger bosons within the same hexagon and can be generally written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the schwinger boson creation operators sitting at site @xmath33 of a hexagon [ see fig .",
    "3(a ) ] . as there are several inequivalent ways of combining six spin-1/2 s into a singlet , @xmath43 in ( [ eq : singletcreation ] )",
    "reflects this freedom of choice . for the wave function in ( [ eq : hss ] ) ,",
    "there are exactly two schwinger bosons for every site and _ no extra projector _ is needed to remove unphysical configurations .    to gain further insight into the hss ansatz",
    ", we exploit the fact that the hexagonal singlet @xmath44 in ( [ eq : hss ] ) can always be decomposed into a superposition of valence - bond singlets ( over - complete bases ) as @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes all allowed singlet - pair configurations ( e.g. , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) , the valence - bond singlet creation operator @xmath49 is defined by @xmath50 and @xmath51 are coefficients controlling the weights of the valence bonds .",
    "generically , @xmath51 can be viewed as a set of free parameters .",
    "comparing to ( [ eq : singletcreation ] ) , an obvious advantage of the parametrization ( [ eq : hexagonalsinglet ] ) is that the @xmath52 lattice symmetry can be easily imposed in these ansatz .",
    "for instance , one may consider a simple choice with @xmath51 only depending on the distance between sites @xmath33 and @xmath53 .",
    "with the help of the schwinger boson representation , we are able to argue that the hss class of states have _ exponentially _ decaying correlation functions , indicating that they describe a class of _ gapped _ spin liquids .",
    "the technical details on the proof of this statement are given in appendix [ app : hss ] .",
    "in short , the argument utilizes the spin - coherent state representation of the schwinger boson states to write the norm of the hss ansatz @xmath54 as the partition function of a two dimensional ( 2d ) classical statistical model describing interacting o(3 ) vectors on the kagome lattice .",
    "additionally , the two - point correlation functions , say , the spin - spin correlation @xmath55 , can be expressed as the correlation function between o(3 ) vectors in the 2d statistical model . as the statistical model is at _ finite _ temperature and has only short - range interactions , long - range order spontaneously breaking o(3 ) symmetry is not allowed , according to the mermin - wagner theorm,@xcite and the correlations between o(3 ) vectors ( equivalently , spin - spin correlations in the hss ansatz ) decay exponentially . this is a direct generalization of the results in ref . showing that 2d aklt states have exponentially decaying correlations .",
    "in addition , the hss construction is not restricted to the kagome lattice , but applies as well to any other lattices possessing hexagon motifs .",
    "for example , we show a spin-3/2 hss ansatz on the honeycomb lattice in fig . [",
    "fig : hss](b ) , where the three spin-1/2 virtual particles surrounding a vertex are symmetrized to constitute the physical spin-3/2 degree of freedom .",
    "it is not difficult to see that our argument on the gapped spin liquid nature of the kagome hss states ( in appendix [ app : hss ] ) also applies to all such hss wave functions in 2d , including the spin-3/2 honeycomb hss state in fig .",
    "[ fig : hss](b ) .",
    "let us now introduce a simple example belonging to the hss class on the kagome lattice , which we call the benzene ring state ( brs ) . based on the brs example , we uncover a resonating aklt loop picture for the hss ansatz .",
    "the brs states are defined by restricting hexagonal singlets in ( [ eq : hexagonalsinglet ] ) to short - range dimers between _ neighboring _ sites .",
    "two ( inequivalent ) such choices for @xmath51 in ( [ eq : hexagonalsinglet ] ) are given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the graphical representations for the above two hexagonal singlet choices , resembling resonating benzene rings , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : benzene](a ) .",
    "when building the wave function ( [ eq : hss ] ) using ( [ eq : benzene1 ] ) or ( [ eq : benzene2 ] ) , expanding the product @xmath58 in ( [ eq : hss ] ) leads to a number of _ nearest - neighbor _ valence - bond configurations . a typical configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ral](a ) .",
    "an interesting observation is that this configuration can be viewed as the covering of spin-1 aklt loops on the kagome lattice .",
    "this is due to the fact that each site shares two spin-1/2 valence bonds ( forming spin-1 physical sites ) , that is to say , every site is involved in two valence bonds , which inevitably form fully packed loop structure .",
    "based on this observation , we conclude that the brs state can be viewed as an _ equal _ weight superposition of resonating aklt loops .    what about the hss ansatz with longer - range valence bonds within each hexagon ?",
    "it is not difficult to see that , when expanding the product @xmath58 in ( [ eq : hexagonalsinglet ] ) , the aklt loop structure in each configuration is still preserved , though the loops can connect sites beyond nearest neighbors ( nn ) .",
    "then , the role of the weights @xmath51 in ( [ eq : hexagonalsinglet ] ) is to control the loop tension .",
    "this shows that _ all _ hss ansatz ( [ eq : hss ] ) belong to the broader family of resonating aklt loop states .",
    "to be concrete , we consider the following expansion of hida s hexagon singlet ( note that the valence bond basis states are non - orthogonal and over - complete , thus the expansion below is not the unique choice , see more discussions in appendix [ variational ] ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath25 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : benzene ] , and @xmath61 is the ground state ( a hexagon singlet ) of a six - site nn heisenberg ring model , firstly used by hida in constructing his hss state .",
    "a straightforward calculation reveals that @xmath62 ( also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : eshss ] ) .",
    "therefore , the corresponding @xmath63 coefficients of the hss state read : @xmath64 which clearly demonstrates the resonating aklt - loop nature of hida s hss state .",
    "coming back to the brs states which can be regarded as an equal weight superposition of aklt loops , it is rather interesting to make a comparison between them with the ral state considered in ref . .",
    "in the latter , the ral state is an equal weight superposition of _ all _ possible aklt loops [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : ral](b ) ] and has @xmath12 topological order on the kagome lattice . however , there is an additional constraint in the brs due to the benzene ring construction which requires that no loop can be formed that contains two successive valence bonds within the same hexagon .",
    "this means that the allowed loop configurations in the brs states are strictly less than those of the ral state .",
    "actually , this leads to an important observation which reveals the difference between them : when the brs state is defined on a torus , cutting the torus in either horizontal or vertical direction always intersects an__even _ _ number of valence bonds [ see fig . [",
    "fig : ral](a ) ] . however , this is not the case for ral states , where such a cut can intersect an even or odd number of valence bonds [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ral](b ) ] . to be precise , there are four types of ral states corresponding to the four combinations of parities for the number of valence bonds encountered along horizontal cuts ( even / odd ) and vertical cuts ( even / odd ) .",
    "for a given ral state , the parities are invariant when the cuts are swept through the lattice.@xcite while the existence of such `` parity '' sectors is essential for @xmath12 topological order , this already gives a hint that there is no topological order ( at least not @xmath12 type ) in the brs state and they are distinct from the ral state , even though they share very similar loop structure with the latter . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tensor ] , we will provide numerical evidence that the hss ansatz , including the brs state , has vanishing topological entanglement entropy and thus no topological order .",

    "their conclusion of vanishing trimerization order on ( i ) is in direct contradiction to cl s observation that stable trimerization order exists on cylinders with width @xmath149.@xcite nn14 estimated the energy per site in the bulk , @xmath15 , by finite - size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "their svbc clusters , ( iv ) , yielded the highest extrapolated energy ( @xmath16 ) ; their cylindrical and periodic clusters , ( i ) and ( ii ) , yielded extrapolated energies ( @xmath150 and @xmath18 , respectively ) consistent with those of cl@xcite and liu _ et al . _ @xcite ; and their hss clusters , ( iii ) , yielded the lowest extrapolated energy ( @xmath19 ) . based on this evidence , nn14 argued that the ground state is a hss state , and not the svbc state advocated in refs .  .    in our opinion ,",
    "nn14 s conclusion is flawed because the tool that they use to distinguish the hss and svbc states , namely ground - state dmrg on finite - size clusters , relies on boundary effects to distinguish these states .",
    "however , such a tool can not reliably estimate the difference in _ bulk _",
    "@xmath15 for these two types of state , since by definition , the _ bulk _ value of @xmath15 is the value obtained for clusters so large that boundary effects vanish .",
    "not surprisingly , the data for their hss and svbc clusters shown in their fig .  4 have a much stronger finite - size dependence ( larger slope of data plotted versus inverse system size ) than their cylinder and periodic clusters",
    "the fact that their extrapolations from the hss and svbc clusters disagree with each other in the thermodynamic limit just means that these clusters are not yet large enough to give reliable bulk @xmath15 values .",
    "thus the discrepancy between nn14 s @xmath15 values for hss and svbc clusters in our opinion does not reflect the true difference in the @xmath15 values of bulk svbc and bulk hss states ; rather , it reflects the error bar , induced by boundary effects , in their determination of the bulk @xmath15 of the true ground state .",
    "in addition , we also would like to point out that in ref .",
    ", a strategy similar to that of nn14 has been applied to @xmath123-@xmath151 honeycomb heisenberg model , there , too , inconsistent results were reported when changing the cluster shapes .",
    "we would also like to make a comment regarding the trick of pinning spin-1/2 s on the open boundary of a spin-1 model .",
    "this trick was first developed for simulating a spin-1 heisenberg chain , where two spin-1/2 s are put on the ends of the open chain to remove the edge states ( and related degeneracies).@xcite some of us ( wl , aw , jvd ) have actually used this trick ourselves in recent work on spin-1 heisenberg chains.@xcite in that context , this trick leads to a better numerical convergence for the bulk properties , since it binds the edge modes localized on both open ends .",
    "importantly , however , it does _ not _ change the bulk physics , i.e. , the _ same _ value for @xmath15 is obtained with or without employing spin-1/2 s on the ends .",
    "@xcite in contrast , in nn14 s work , the presence or absence of spin-1/2 particles on the outermost sites of their hss or svbc cluster , respectively , is an attempt to use boundary effects to stabilize two states with _ different _ bulk properties .",
    "as argued above , this strategy is intrinsically flawed .",
    "thus , in our opinion nn14 are mistaken in believing that their dmrg calculations on hss clusters can be used to reliably predict the bulk properties of hss states .",
    "their dmrg calculations target purely ground state properties , and if a certain type of state ( here the hss state ) happens _ not _ to be the actual ground state ( as argued in the present paper and in refs . ) , then its bulk properties are simply inaccessible to nn14 s dmrg simulations .",
    "in contrast , through the present work we find an explicit tensor network state representation for the hss state family , which makes hida s hss state readily accessible with tensor network methods . we show unambiguously that the best hss variational energy for the spin-1 khaf model is @xmath152 , much higher than nn s  hss \" energy ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "in contrast to nn14 s hss and svbc data , their data for cylinder and periodic clusters show much weaker finite - size effects ( smaller slopes when plotted versus inverse system size ) .",
    "we believe that the @xmath15 values extrapolated from this data _ do _ reflect the bulk @xmath15 value of the true ground state rather accurately ",
    "they are certainly consistent with our own @xmath15 values and those of cl .",
    "we find it all the more surprising and perplexing that nn14 did not observe evidence for svbc order in their cylinder clusters , whereas cl , who used essentially similar cylindrical clusters , did.@xcite we suspect that in nn14 s calculations the presence of a symmetry - breaking ground state was still hidden by boundary effects , which can cause a non - symmetry - breaking ground state to appear through superposition . indeed",
    ", cl reported that in their calculations svbc order emerged clearly only in their cylinders of largest circumference ( width 8) .",
    "we conclude with a comment about the bond dimension used in the present tensor network study , namely @xmath154 ( corresponding to @xmath155 in tabs . [",
    "tab : r - tensor - brs ] and [ tab : r - tensor ] ) , or @xmath156 .",
    "one might ask : is our conclusion in section  [ sec : variational ] that hss states have higher energy than svbc states robust with respect to increasing @xmath157 ? perhaps hss states would yield a lower energy than svbs states if each hexagon were allowed to involve not only spin-1/2 virtual particles but also higher - spin virtual particles ? in this regard , we note that the hss states studied here are a subset of the much more general class of tensor network states studied by liu _",
    "et al . _ in ref .  , where tensor network variational calculations were performed with bond dimensions as large as @xmath158 , implying that many more virtual particles with higher spin were included .",
    "those large-@xmath157 calculations showed unambiguously that the spin-1 khaf model possesses a svbc ground state with @xmath159 .",
    "therefore , the conclusion of the present work , that hss states lie significantly higher in energy than svbc states , is not specific to using an hss ansatz with @xmath156 , as done here ; instead , the results of ref .   demonstrate that it holds throughout as @xmath157 is increased up to @xmath158 , a value sufficiently large that the results reported in ref .",
