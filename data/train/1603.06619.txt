    "peaks over thresholds ( pot ) modelling was introduced in the hydrological literature @xcite . the philosophy is simple : extreme events , perhaps extreme water levels , are often quite different from ordinary everyday behavior , and ordinary behavior then has little to say about extremes , so that only other extreme events give useful information about future extreme events .",
    "to make this idea operational , one defines an extreme event as a value , say a water level , which exceeds some high threshold , and only uses the sizes of the excesses over this threshold , the `` peaks over the threshold '' , for statistical inference .",
    "this idea was given a theoretical foundation by combining it with asymptotic arguments motivating that the natural model is that exceedances occur according to a poisson process and that excess sizes follow a generalized pareto ( gp ) distribution @xcite .",
    "since then , thousands of papers have used one - dimensional pot models ( though often not under this name ) , in areas ranging from earth and atmosphere science to finance , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the method has also been presented in a number of books , see e.g.   @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , often it is not just one extreme event which is important , but an entire extreme episode . in the 2005 flooding of new orleans caused by windstorm katrina",
    ", more than 50 dykes were breached . however , many others held , and damage was determined by which dykes held and which were flooded @xcite .",
    "extreme rain can lead to devastating landslides , and can be caused by one day with very extreme rainfall , or by two or more consecutive days with smaller , but still extreme rain amounts @xcite .",
    "the 2003 heat - wave in central europe is estimated to have killed between 25000 and 70000 people .",
    "many deaths , however , were not caused by one extremely hot day , but rather by a sequence of very high minimum nightly temperatures which led to increasing fatigue and eventually to death @xcite .",
    "these and very many other important societal problems underline the importance of statistical methods which can handle multivariate extreme episodes .    the aim of this paper is to contribute to the probabilistic understanding , physically based models , likelihood tools , and simulation methods which are needed for multivariate pot modelling of extreme episodes , also in higher dimensions . using the same philosophy as for extreme events in one dimension , pot modelling of extreme episodes proceeds by choosing a high threshold for each component of the episode , and then to consider an episode as extreme if at least one component exceeds its threshold .",
    "one then only models the difference between the values of the components and their respective thresholds .",
    "however , in the multivariate case both the heights of the peaks over the thresholds and the depths of the troughs under the thresholds are modeled .",
    "for instance , in a rainfall episode affecting a number of catchments , both the amount of rain in the catchments where rainfall exceeds the threshold and in catchments where the threshold is not exceeded are important .",
    "additionally , the inclusion of troughs , or undershoots , increases the amount of information that can be used for inference .    just as in one dimension ,",
    "the natural model is that extreme episodes occur according to a poisson process and that overshoots and undershoots ( or undershoots larger than a censoring threshold ) jointly follow a multivariate gp distribution .",
    "below we derive the basic properties of this class of distributions .",
    "we then pursue the following program :    to exhibit the possible point process limits of extreme episodes in data ;    to show how conditioning on threshold exceedances transforms the distribution of the extreme episodes to gp distributions , and to use this to find physically motivated representations of the multivariate gp distributions ; and    to derive likelihoods and censored likelihoods for the representations in ( ii ) .    in part ( ii ) of the program",
    ", we develop four representations .",
    "the first one is in the same units as the observations , i.e. , on the real scale , and in the second one the model is built on a standard exponential scale and then transformed to the real observation scale .",
    "the third is a spectral representation proposed in @xcite , and the fourth one a simple reformulation of this representation aimed at aiding model construction .",
    "a useful , and to us surprising , discovery is that it is possible to derive the density also for the fourth representation , and that this density in fact is simpler than the densities for the other two first representations .",
    "the importance of ( iii ) is that likelihood inference makes it possible to incorporate covariates , e.g.  temporal or spatial trends , in a flexible and practical way .    the insights and results obtained in carrying out this program",
    ", we believe , will lead to new models , new computational techniques , and new ways to make the necessary compromises between modeling realism and computational tractability which together will make possible routine use , also in higher dimensions .",
    "the models mentioned in example  [ ex : nuggets ] may be a case in point .",
    "the formulas for probabilities , conditional probabilities and conditional densities given in sections  [ sec : densities ] and  [ sec : condprob ] , together with the discovery that weighted sums of components of gp distributions conditioned to be positive also have a gp distribution , add to the usefulness of the methods .",
    "simulation of gp distributions is needed for several reasons , including computation of the probabilities of complex dangerous events and goodness of fit checking .",
    "the final contribution of this paper is a number of simulation algorithms for multivariate gp distributions .",
    "the multivariate gp distributions were introduced in @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  8) , and @xcite ; see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  5 ) .",
    "the literature on applications of multivariate pot modelling is rather sparse @xcite .",
    "some earlier papers use point process models which are closely related to the pot / gp approach @xcite .",
    "other papers consider nonparametric or semiparametric rank - based pot methods focusing on the dependence structure but largely ignoring modelling the margins @xcite .",
    "however , the gp approach has the advantages that it provides complete models for the threshold excesses , that it can use well - established model checking tools , and that , compared to the point process approach , it leads to more natural parametrizations of trends in the poisson process which governs the occurrence of extreme episodes .",
    "there is an important literature on modelling componentwise , perhaps yearly , maxima with multivariate generalized extreme value ( gev ) distributions : for a survey in the spatial context see @xcite .",
    "however , componentwise maxima may occur at different times for different components , and in many situations focus is on the pot structure : extremes which occur simultaneously .",
    "additionally , likelihood inference for gev distributions is complicated by a lack of tractable analytic expressions for high - dimensional densities , so that inference often is much easier , and perhaps more efficient , in gp models ; see @xcite for a survey and an extensive comparison .",
    "section  [ sec : background ] derives and exemplifies the basic properties of the gp cumulative distribution functions ( cdf - s ) . in section  [ sec : point processes ] we develop a point process model of extreme episodes , and section  [ sec : representation ] shows how conditioning on exceeding high thresholds leads to three basic representations of the gp distributions .",
    "section  [ sec : densities ] exhibits the fourth representation and derives densities and censored likelihoods , while section  [ sec : condprob ] gives formulas for probabilities and conditional probabilities in gp distributions .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : simulation ] contributes simulation algorithms for multivariate gp distributions and section  [ sec : conclusion ] discusses parametrization issues and gives a concluding overview .",
    "this section first briefly recalls and adapts existing theory for multivariate gev distributions , and then derives a number of the basic properties of gp distributions .    throughout",
    "we use notation as follows .",
    "the maximum and minimum operators are denoted by the symbols @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",

    "if @xmath10 is a cdf then we write @xmath11 for its tail function , and also write @xmath10 for the probability distribution determined by the cdf .",
    "that @xmath12 means that @xmath13 has distribution @xmath10 , and @xmath14 denotes convergence in distribution .",
    "the symbol @xmath15 is the indicator function : @xmath16 equals @xmath17 on the set @xmath18 and @xmath19 otherwise .    for fixed @xmath20 ,",
    "the functions @xmath21 ( for @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 are to be interpreted as their limits @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , if @xmath26 .",
    "this convention also applies componentwise to expressions of the form @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
