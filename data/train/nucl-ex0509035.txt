    "recently observed anomalies in the energy dependence of hadron production in central pb+pb collisions @xcite suggest that the onset of deconfinement may be located at the low cern sps energies @xmath5 gev @xcite . in the identification of the effects possibly related to the onset of deconfinement in heavy ion collisions",
    "a comparison with the corresponding results obtained in nucleon - nucleon interactions plays a special role . in case of the study of energy dependence of pion and kaon multiplicities",
    "this comparison was done based on the existing compilations of the data on all inelastic proton - proton ( p+p ) , proton - neutron and proton - antiproton ( p+@xmath1 ) interactions @xcite .",
    "a recently found @xcite anomaly in the energy dependence of the shape of transverse mass ( @xmath6 ) spectra of hadrons produced in central pb+pb collisions raised significant interest [ 5 - 8 ] .",
    "it motivates an effort to compile the corresponding results in p+p(@xmath1 ) interactions . the first compilation of the transverse mass spectra of kaons was already published @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper the compilation of the @xmath6 spectra of @xmath0 hyperons is presented and discussed . the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 the existing data are reviewed and analyzed .",
    "the energy dependence of the spectra is presented and discussed in section  3 .",
    "the paper is closed by the summary , section  4 .",
    "we start from review of the data on @xmath0 hyperon transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) and transverse mass spectra in all inelastic p+p(@xmath1 ) interactions .    in most cases the original experimental papers present @xmath8 spectra in the form @xmath9 or @xmath10 . from these results",
    "the transverse mass @xmath6 ( @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the particle rest mass ) spectra @xmath13 can be easily obtained ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "our compilation and analysis is limited to the low @xmath8 region , @xmath15  gev / c .",
    "first , it is because in this region the @xmath8 spectra of @xmath0 hyperons were measured by many experiments and therefore a systematic study is possible .",
    "second , this is the region where the shape of the spectra in a+a collisions is determined by the hydrodynamical expansion of the matter and thus it is sensitive to the change of the equation of state due to the onset of deconfinement . in this region",
    "an exponential parameterization of the p+p(@xmath1 ) data : @xmath16 is approximately valid the spectra obey a power law behavior , @xmath17 , which is interpreted as due to hard ( parton ) scattering . ] . in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] the inverse slope parameter @xmath18 and the normalization parameter @xmath19 are free parameters and their values are extracted from the least square fits to the experimental spectra .",
    "most of the compiled @xmath8 spectra are measured either close to mid - rapidity ( y@xmath20 ) or they are integrated over forward or backward hemispheres .",
    "transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 hyperons produced in all inelastic p+p interactions are measured in fixed target [ 10 - 23 ] mostly bubble chamber experiments , at energies below @xmath21  gev . at higher energies , @xmath22  gev ,",
    "the data on the spectra are taken in collider experiments at isr [ 24 , 25 ] and rhic [ 26 ] .",
    "the measurements for p+@xmath1 interactions are performed at the sp@xmath1s and fermilab colliders @xcite at @xmath23  gev .",
    "all results come from the analysis of charged decays of @xmath0 hyperons , @xmath0  @xmath24 .",
    "the summary of the data on @xmath25 spectra of @xmath0 hyperons is given in tables 1 and 2 , where @xmath26 , the @xmath27 range selected for the analysis , the longitudinal acceptance in which the measurement was done and the reference to the original experimental papers are given .",
    "the @xmath6 spectra are plotted as a function of ( @xmath28 ) in figs .  1 - 3 .",
    "the normalization of the spectra is arbitrary .",
    "they are ordered from bottom to top according to increasing energy .",

    "the corresponding functions are plotted in figs .  1 - 3 by solid lines .",
    "it is seen that the used parametrization ( eq .  [ eq1 ] ) , reasonably well describes @xmath0 spectra in the studied @xmath6 range at all energies ( @xmath2  gev ) , both for p+p and p+@xmath1 interactions .",
    "+ the mean @xmath6 in the range @xmath32 gev / c@xmath33 was calculated using measured data .",
    "if necessary , the results were corrected for the unmeasured tails of the distributions by use of the exponential function .",

    "the energy dependence of the @xmath18 and ( @xmath34 ) parameters calculated in the @xmath6 interval ( @xmath29  gev / c@xmath30 to the @xmath6 spectra of @xmath0 hyperons produced in all inelastic p+p(@xmath1 ) interactions are shown in figs .  4 and 5 .",
    "the results were parametrized by an expression : @xmath35 where @xmath36 or ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are fit parameters and @xmath26 is given in units of gev .",
    "the best fit to the inverse slope parameter data presented in fig .  4 yields @xmath39  mev , @xmath40  mev and @xmath41 .",
    "the parameters fitted to the mean transverse mass data are @xmath42  mev , @xmath43  mev and @xmath44 .    in both cases",
    "the observed deviations of points from the parameterizations are mostly consistent with ones expected from the experimental errors .",
    "the compiled results indicate that @xmath18 and ( @xmath34 ) increase monotonically with the collision energy from @xmath45  mev and ( @xmath46  mev at @xmath47  gev to @xmath48  mev and ( @xmath49  mev at @xmath50  gev .",
    "no significant differences are seen between data for p+p and p+@xmath1 interactions and between mid - rapidity and integrated data .",
    "note that in general one expects flatter spectra for mid - rapidity results , this trend is suggested by several low energy points .",
    "data of higher statistical precision are needed to draw firm conclusions on the details of energy dependence of the shape of @xmath6 spectra in p+p(@xmath1 ) interactions .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath6 spectra in nucleus - nucleus collisions are still sparse , but the new results at sps and rhic energies are expected soon .",
    "the measured values of the @xmath18 parameter in central pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions are in the range @xmath51  mev at @xmath52  gev [ 29 - 34 ] .",
    "they are significantly larger than the corresponding p+p(@xmath1 ) results .",
    "we compiled and analyzed data on @xmath25 spectra of @xmath0 hyperons produced in all inelastic p+p and p+@xmath1 interactions .",
    "the spectra can be reasonably well described by a simple exponential parametrization @xmath53 in the whole analyzed @xmath6 interval ( @xmath54 0.7 @xmath55 ) .",
