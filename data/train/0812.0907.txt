    "however , this effect can only be evident if such a crossover occurs when there is still enough correlation between spins to develop  at least  half - period of modulation , i.e. roughly for @xmath187 .",
    "in fact , if the period of the underlying modulated phase is much larger than the correlation length @xmath120 , two - point correlations just display a monotonic decay as a function of the lattice separation .",
    "a detailed investigation of this phenomenon would be , indeed , intriguing but it is beyond the purpose of the present work .",
    "the mean - field approximation reported e.g. in ref .   provides some straightforward results concerning ferromagnetic ising system frustrated by a long - range interaction .",
    "however , the mfa fails in one important instance : it predicts that the modulated order in the ground state propagates at finite temperatures up to a second - order transition temperature @xmath188 , while the landau - peierls instability forbids a finite on - site @xmath189 at any finite temperature  @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "mc simulations are much more accurate than the mfa , but very difficult to perform under experimentally realistic conditions .",

    "strikingly , it decays with temperature in a way that is similar to the temperature dependence of the stripe - domain width observed in mfa and experimentally on fe / cu(001 ) films  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spatial profile of the correlation function contains the same kind of higher harmonics appearing in the mfa spin profile , with only one fundamental harmonic remaining at sufficiently high temperatures , as specified within the mfa and found experimentally  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the mfa , which predicts a second - order phase transition also in 1d , we do not find any trace of a phase transition  and this is a major deviation from full two - dimensional mc simulations  @xcite or experimental findings .",
    "when the spatial decay of the long - range interaction is too short - ranged , the ground state and the finite - temperature state lose the modulated character and become uniform . correspondingly , the system crosses over from the universality class proper of 1d systems with continuous symmetry  @xcite to the standard 1d ising - like universality class  @xcite . + for future work , a more accurate treatment of the displacement field @xmath137 beyond the @xmath190 approximation ( see appendix  [ appendix_c ] ) is certainly to be considered .",

    "more explicitly , the interaction between two spins separated by @xmath73 lattice sites reads @xmath192 where the index @xmath193 accounts for the number @xmath194 of replicated boxes .",

    "this approximation reduces the main computational task to evaluating the finite sum over @xmath193 , which is  however  rapidly convergent .",
    "finally , the working hamiltonian , restricted to our simulation box , is given by @xmath201 which descends directly from with the replica assumption @xmath202 ( @xmath203 ) , periodic boundary conditions on the simulation box @xmath204 and setting @xmath205 .",

    "the sa is extensively applied in statistical physics with the intent to study systems where both the ground - state energy and the equilibrium at low temperatures are inaccessible through the basic metropolis criterion  @xcite .",
    "certainly , spin glasses  @xcite , frustrated magnetic spin structures  @xcite and models with long - range interactions  @xcite are some typical examples of systems where the sa and related methods  @xcite are largely exploited .",
    "we also have to remind that in literature some cluster methods were employed in order to reach a correct thermodynamic equilibrium for a simple model where ferromagnetic long - range interactions are only present @xcite .",
    "however , the strong frustration due to the competition between the antiferromagnetic long - range interactions and the nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic exchange interaction renders the generalization of such cluster mc technique to the present case non - trivial . for these reason ,",

    "_  @xcite . a random initial configuration ( which should be considered as a paramagnetic state )",
    "is picked up .",
    "subsequently , the thermodynamic equilibrium at a high enough temperature @xmath211 is established .",
    "we remember that the mc steps per spin considered here only comprise metropolis moves at the analyzed temperature .",
    "@xmath211 is usually chosen in order to have a high mc acceptance ratio per spin .",
    "then the temperature is decreased gradually @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) , and a fixed number of mc steps per spin @xmath214 is run , starting with the last configuration sampled at the previous higher temperature .",
    "so , the main assumption is to force a constant and sufficiently slow cooling rate , defined as @xmath215 .",
    "we have taken @xmath216 and @xmath217 depending on the studied value of @xmath6 .",

    "<S> we consider a one - dimensional lattice of ising - type variables where the ferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath0 between neighboring sites is frustrated by a long - ranged anti - ferromagnetic interaction of strength @xmath1 between the sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 , decaying as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 . for @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> smaller than a certain threshold @xmath7 , which is larger than 2 and depends on the ratio @xmath8 , the ground state consists of an ordered sequence of segments with equal length and alternating magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the segments depends on both @xmath6 and the ratio @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> our monte carlo study shows that the on - site magnetization vanishes at finite temperatures and finds no indication of any phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> yet , the modulation present in the ground state is recovered at finite temperatures in the two - point correlation function , which oscillates in space with a characteristic spatial period : the latter depends on @xmath6 and @xmath8 and decreases smoothly from the ground - state value as the temperature is increased . </S>",
    "<S> such an oscillation of the correlation function is exponentially damped over a characteristic spatial scale , the correlation length , which asymptotically diverges roughly as the inverse of the temperature as @xmath9 is approached . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the long - range interaction causes the ising chain to fall into a universality class consistent with an underlying continuous symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath10 temperature dependence of the correlation length and the uniform ferromagnetic ground state , characteristic of the @xmath11 discrete ising symmetry , are recovered for @xmath12 . </S>"
