    "recent experimental breakthroughs in spinor boson - einstein condensate , such as the sub - poissonian spin correlations generated by atomic four - wave spin mixing @xcite , the atomic squeezed states realized in the spin-1 ultracold atomic ensembles @xcite , and the antiferromagnetic spatial ordering observed in a quenched one - dimensional spin-1 gas @xcite , are all in connection with the vacuum fluctuations and recall attentions to the finite particle number effect beyond the mean - field treatment .",
    "the vacuum fluctuations become a significant subject in more and more experimental facts , e.g. , atomic quantum matter - wave optics , atomic spin squeezing and quantum information . as one of the active frontiers , the spin-1 ultracold atomic ensemble is often adopted . with the basic interaction form @xmath1 , the properties of such a three - component spinor condensate @xcite have been demonstrated experimentally @xcite and two different phases reflecting fundamental properties of spin correlation are identified : the so - called polar and ferromagnetic states for @xmath2 ( @xmath3na ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5rb ) atomic condensates respectively .",
    "the mixture of two spinor condensate with the ferromagnetic and polar atoms , respectively , show more attractive quantum effects luo , xu09,xu2,zhang1,zhang2 , yushi , wangdajun , wangdajun2 . with the help of",
    "sympathetic cooling , the bec mixtures of na and rb have been realized and it is interesting to observe the interspecies interaction induced immiscibility between the two condensates @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the condensate with @xmath2 has been predicted to be either polar ( @xmath6 ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath7 within the mean - field treatment , where the condensate is usually described by a coherent state .",
    "however , the many - body theory by law , pu and bigelow @xcite pointed out that the ground state of @xmath2 atoms is a spin singlet with properties ( @xmath8 ) drastically different with the results predicted by the mean field theory .",
    "soon , ho and yip @xcite show that this spin singlet state is a fragmented condensate with anomalously large number fluctuations and thus has fragile stability .",
    "the remarkable nature of this super - fragmentation is that the single particle reduced density matrix gives three macroscopic eigenvalues ( @xmath9 ) with large number fluctuations @xmath10 .",
    "similar considerations were also addressed by koashi and ueda @xcite .",
    "the signature of fragmentation is then refer to the anomalously large fluctuations of the populations in the zeeman levels .",
    "this is a super - poissonian correlation character , and the large number fluctuations shrink rapidly as the experimentally adventitious perturbations exist , such as magnetic field or field gradient .    in this paper",
    "we will report the influence of external magnetic field on the spinor condensate with @xmath2 , but on the premise of doping many ferromagnetic atoms in it .",
    "the interspecies spin coupling interaction arises and we propose a valid procedure to observe and control the fragmented states . if the ferromagnetic atoms in the mixture are condensed , the ground state favors all atoms aligned along the same direction and provides a uniform and stable background which can delay the rapidly shrinking of the number fluctuations when the inter - species coupling interaction is adjusted .",
    "the back action from polar atoms on to the more stable ferromagnetic atoms is negligible .",
    "doping ferromagnetic atoms into spin-1 polar condensate can effectively influence the vacuum fluctuations and will have potential applications in quantum information and quantum - enhanced magnetometry .",
    "we consider the mixture of two spinor condensates of @xmath11 ferromagnetic and @xmath12 polar atoms , respectively .",
    "the intra - condensate atomic spin-1 interaction takes the standard interaction form @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the inter - condensate interaction between the ferromagnetic and polar atoms is @xmath15 , which is more complicated because collision can occur in the total spin @xmath16 channel between different atoms @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are related to the @xmath19-wave scattering lengths in the three total spin channels and the reduced mass @xmath20 for atoms in different species , and @xmath21 projects an inter - species pair into spin singlet state . within the single spatial - mode approximation ( sma )",
    "@xcite for each of the two spinor condensates , the spin - dependent hamiltonian for the mixture finally reads as @xmath22where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are defined in terms of the @xmath25 spin-1 matrices with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 creates a ferromagnetic ( polar ) atom in the hyperfine state @xmath28 .",

    "all interaction parameters are in the units of @xmath40,width=288 ]      when the interspecies scattering parameters are calculated in the degenerate internal - state approximation ( dia ) @xcite , the low - energy atomic interactions can be mostly attributed to the ground - state configurations of the two valence electrons , and the non - commutative term @xmath41 can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the ground states are classified into four distinct phases : ff , mm@xmath42 , mm@xmath43 , and aa by three critical values of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the spin - dependent hamiltonian in the magnetic field reads , @xmath47where only the linear zeeman terms are considered . as the su(2 ) symmetry is broken in a spinor mixture , one can not eliminate the linear zeeman effect through a spin rotation @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the quadratic zeeman energy , typically 2 orders of magnitude weaker than the linear terms , is negligible in the calculation of number distributions .",
    "furthermore , we take @xmath48 in the following discussion , which can easily realized through adjusting the trapping frequency .",
    "we consider the direct product of the fock states of the two species @xmath49 , and do not restrict the model in the subspace with zero total magnetization @xcite .",
    "instead , we consider the full space including all possible system magnetization @xmath50 .",
    "using the full quantum approach of exact diagonalization , we study the response of the two species to the external magnetic field @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "the three critical points for the phase boundaries are approximately @xmath53 .",
    "the field dependence of the population is shown in fig . 1 for the mm@xmath43 phase at @xmath54 , where polar atoms are partly polarized in the oppsite direction as the ferromagnetic atoms @xcite .",
    "we notice that the ferromagnetic atoms ( black dashed lines ) are very sensitive to the magnetic field , i.e. atoms quickly redistribute in the @xmath55 component and the magnetization of ferromagnetic condensate @xmath56 saturates immediately .",
    "the ferromagnetic atoms actually form a stable condensate and provide a uniform magnetic background in the mixture .",
    "the polar atoms present a stepwise increase ( decrease ) in the atom number distribution @xmath57 when the field increases . for small @xmath51 and positive @xmath58",
    ", the system favors a negative magnetization ( @xmath59 ) of polar condensate , and @xmath60 will reverse and tend to saturate for large magnetic field .",
    "we notice that the super - fragmented state featured with @xmath61 remarkably arises around a special value of @xmath62 .",
    "the situation becomes more simple if the parameter @xmath63 is negative , that is , in the ff phase ( or mm@xmath42 phase ) , where polar atoms are fully ( partly ) polarized in the same direction as the ferromagnetic atoms .",
    "the enhanced ferromagnetic effect and the external magnetic field jointly suppress the atom number distribution @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the polar condensate to zero , and at the same time saturate @xmath55 and the magnetization @xmath60 without magnetization reversal .",

    ", one can see a rapid shrink of the spin-0 component distribution @xmath64 and an unbalanced population @xmath81 .",
    "the super - fragmented state then reduces to a much more generic fragmented state : a two component number state with essentially zero fluctuations .",
    "such state with polar interaction was not likely realized in typical experiments due to its fragility towards any perturbation breaking spin rotational symmetry .    for the spin-1 polar condensate doped with many ferromagnetic atoms , we can retrieve this super - fragmented state in the presence of an external field .",
    "for some special values of the magnetic field , both the spin-0 component population and number fluctuations would not shrink but revive to macroscopic orders of the super - fragmented state . in fig .",
    "2 , we illustrate the revival points for three inter - species coupling parameters @xmath82 .",
    "these revival points are found to move towards larger value of @xmath51 as @xmath82 increases .",
    "as learned from previous studies @xcite , the mean - field treatment is efficient for atomic interaction of the ferromagnetic type .",
    "the much more stable ferromagnetic condensate in the mixture can be formulated in the mean field treatment as a boson - enhanced effective magnetic field .",
    "this simplifies the hamiltonian ( [ hhh ] ) as @xmath83where @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 the criterion for the emergence of super - fragmented state is @xmath87 , where the magnetic field ( @xmath51 ) , the optical trapping frequency ( @xmath88 ) , and the number of the doped ferromagnetic atoms ( @xmath89 ) are all adjustable . when the magnetic field matches the condition that @xmath90 and @xmath91 cancel each other , we may achieve the super - fragmented state in a magnetic field .",

    "3 . when equal population @xmath94 occurs for the polar condensate , the number fluctuations also instantaneously reach to the macroscopic levels .",
    "our numerical results for the fluctuation relation ( @xmath95 ) agree exactly with the algebraic results in @xcite for pure polar condensate . with the emergence of equal population @xmath9 regarded as a sign of anti - ferromagnetic spin interaction ,",
    "the inter - species spin coupling interaction @xmath63 can be estimated by the location of the critical magnetic field .     of the polar condensate on both @xmath68 and magnetic field",

    "it is a many - body spin singlet , which requires exactly the same atoms number of the two species ( @xmath98 ) , and total spins from different species polarized in opposite directions . in the notation of the angular momentum representation @xmath99 aa phase",

    "the intra - species angular momentum states involved in the aa phase , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , should obey the constraint @xmath107 .",
    "the interesting feature of aa phase is the equal distribution of atoms in the six components ( @xmath9 ) and the large number fluctuations . using the full quantum approach of exact diagonalization , and considering the full space including all possible system magnetization @xmath108",

    "compared with the pure polar spin - singlet state , the inter - species entangled singlet seems to be more difficult to be magnetized as @xmath51 increases . when all the polar atoms are forced to arrange in the opposite direction of the ferromagnetic ones , the bose - enhanced magnetic background formed by ferromagnetic condensate will be canceled .",
    "the system spontaneously breaks into a high symmetry state when the interaction parameter @xmath63 goes across the phase transition point @xmath115 .",
    "the magnetic behaviors of the two species are then identical ( except for the atom mass ) , and both ferromagnetic atoms and polar atoms are equally to be magnetized when the field intensity is increased . compared with the pure singlet in fig .",
    "4a , the involved total atoms are doubled , and at least a field strength @xmath116 is needed to saturate the magnetization .",
    "the external magnetic field can be used to characterize these two spin - singlets through tracing the atoms numbers of @xmath64 component of the polar atoms .",
    "if we refer to more general case beyond the dia approximation , the @xmath18 term of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) should be considered .",

    "we find that the crucial point is still located at @xmath93 , but a tiny @xmath125 will elevate the @xmath64 component to a dominated value , meanwhile suppress the @xmath55 and @xmath65 components to lower level .",
