    "anisotropic spheres in general relativity , in spherically symmetric spacetimes which are not static , have continued to attract the attention of researchers since the pioneering work of bowers and liang@xcite .",
    "some of the interesting recent papers published in this regard include the works of dev and gleiser @xcite , herrera _ _ et al__@xcite , ivanov@xcite , mak and harko@xcite , and sharma and mukherjee@xcite .",
    "the original reason for studying relativistic anisotropic spheres was to generate models that permit redshifts higher than the critical redshift @xmath1 of isotropic matter .",
    "the analysis of bondi@xcite demonstrated the feasibility and stability of higher redshifts for anisotropic newtonian and relativistic stars .",
    "anisotropy can not be neglected in stellar clusters and galaxies , in addition to individual stars , as pointed out by binney and tremaine@xcite , cuddeford @xcite and michie@xcite .",
    "anisotropy may be an intrinsic feature of boson stars as suggested by dev and gleiser@xcite and mak and harko@xcite .",
    "sharma and mukherjee@xcite considered the theoretical possibility of anisotropy in strange stars , with densities greater than neutron stars but less than black holes , which are bound stable stellar bodies .    in a recent treatment chaisi and",
    "maharaj@xcite found an exact anisotropic solution to the field equations utilizing an algorithm of maharaj and maartens@xcite .",
    "this solution has a simple form : it can be expressed completely in terms of elementary functions and it has a clear physical interpretation . in this analysis we extend the chaisi and maharaj@xcite solution to include anisotropic models which allow for a wide variety of densities which are physically reasonable .",
    "we present four classes of solution and discuss their physical features . in  2 we present the relevant classes of solutions in the form of tables to ensure clarity and to highlight the interconnections between the classes . in ",
    "3 the physical features of our solutions are briefly discussed , and  4 contains the discussion .",
    "the einstein field equations to be integrated are @xmath2 in the above we have defined @xmath3 which is the mass function .",
    "the radial pressure @xmath4 and the tangential pressure @xmath5 are not equal for anisotropic matter .",
    "the magnitude @xmath6 provides a measure of anisotropy .",
    "the field equations ( [ efes2:1])-([efes2:3 ] ) were integrated by chaisi and maharaj @xcite for the energy density @xmath7 where @xmath8 are constants .",
    "it is possible to integrate the field equations for other choices of the energy density which are physically acceptable . in this section",
    "we present three new classes of exact solutions to supplement the class found earlier .",

    "we have presented four new classes of solution which model anisotropic stars .",
    "these solutions may be broadly divided into two categories in terms of the behaviour of the energy density @xmath9 at the centre @xmath10 : the first category contains the limiting case @xmath0 , and in the second category the singularity at the centre of the star is not present .",
    "the solutions found permit @xmath11 and @xmath12 which allow for decreasing and increasing energy densities as we move from the centre to the boundary of the star .",
    "note that the solutions presented in this paper have the feature that @xmath13 in general so that the anisotropy factor @xmath14 ; consequently our solutions do not have an isotropic limit .",
    "we make three observations relating to the physical reasonableness of our model .",
    "firstly , the vanishing of the pressure at the boundary is a consequence of the first and second fundamental forms ; there is no restriction placed on the tangential pressure which may be nonvanishing .",
    "this feature is also evident in the solutions of chaisi and maharaj @xcite , maharaj and maartens @xcite and gokhroo and mehra @xcite .",
    "secondly , the solutions in this paper do not satisfy an equation of state . for a realistic astrophysical matter distribution",
    "we should impose a barotropic equation of state relating the pressure and energy density ; this will be pursued in future work .",
    "thirdly , we observe that for realistic models the space derivatives of the matter field should be negative .",
    "this will have the effect of restricting the arbitrary constants in the energy density ; for example this would place restrictions on the relative magnitudes of @xmath8 of case i.",
