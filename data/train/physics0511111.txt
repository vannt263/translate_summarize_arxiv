    "it has often been noted that the effects of gr can largely be understood and treated easily within the gem framework .",
    "for example , the famous lense - thirring precession effect of gr is simpler and clearer to use the gem equations@xcite ; and the gravitomagnetism is a useful insight for understanding the schiff effect@xcite and the faraday  effect@xcite . in special , just from our electromagnetic experience , we can infer that at a distance should present gravitational waves predicted by gr .",
    "therefore , the existence of the gem fields is equivalent of the existence of the gravitational waves predicted by gr@xcite .",
    "the many efforts that have been made to detect gravitational waves have",
    "so far given no convincing evidence that they have actually been seen . in the late 1960s and early 1970s",
    ", weber announced that he had recorded simultaneous oscillations in detectors 1000 km apart , waves he believed originated from an astrophysical event .",
    "but many physicists were suspicious of the results that were several orders of magnitude higher than were theoretically predicted .",
    "in addition , observed high energies of gravitational waves by weber have not been confirmed by these independent measurements .",
    "this is perhaps , due to the fact that gravitational waves with high energies are very rarer than many physicists had expected . on the other hand ,",
    "it is highly possible that the gravitational waves can get largely increase rate as the waves interact with interstellar matter , so that weber s result , perhaps , are acceptable .    in order to study the nonlinear effects on a very larger scale , where the mean free path for collision between the particles of the matter",
    "is larger compared with the characteristic length appearing in the problem , a kinetic treatment is required : the physical systems should be described by the magnetic - type maxwell - vlasov equations .",
    "the small amplitude and high - frequency approximation are employed for the gravitational waves , such that perturbed techniques can be applied .",
    "the effects deal with resonant wave - particle and wave - wave interactions , inhomogeneties of the matter distribution and nonlinear self - collapsing .",
    "a previous work@xcite is just devoted to the study of the nonlinear interactions in the absence of gravitomagnetic field .",
    "the present paper considering gravitomagnetic component is a generalization of the work .",
    "and our another work@xcite is its analog of electromagnetism .    in section",
    "ii we establish the description of collisionless kinetics and give the linear effects .",
    "then we present the nonlinear equations of the fields with low frequency and high frequency , starting from gme equations in sections iii and iv . in section",

    "finally we sketch the conclusions , stressing the possibility of detecting gravitational waves .",
    "taking into account the presence of massive dark matter in the universe , one should treat a two - component self - gravitating system .",

    "<S> ( [ eq6.9])-([eq6.11 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show that they may collapse . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , due to self - condensing , a stronger gme fields could be produced ; and they could appear as the gravitational waves with high energy reaching on earth . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> weber results , perhaps , are acceptable . </S>"
