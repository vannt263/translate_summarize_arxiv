    "over the past few decades , a considerable number of studies have been done on the phenomena of multi - particle correlations induced by collisions between elementary particles .",
    "it is understood that the studies of correlations between produced particles , the effects of coherence and chaoticity , an estimation of particle emitting source size play an important role in high energy physics .",
    "+ in papers [ 1,2 ] , there were established and developed the master equations in the form of the field operator evolution equation ( langevin - like [ 3 ] ) , which allows one to gain a better understanding of the structure of the emitting source .",

    "+ there is still no definite explanation of the above mentioned mass dependence .",
    "the aim of this paper is , firstly , to carry out the numerical analysis applied to the lep data ( e.g. , aleph collaboration ) on two - particle bec in the framework of quantum field theory at finite temperature @xmath5 approach [ 1,2 ] , and secondly , to give the proposal on bec studies at the tevatron energies .",
    "+ we simulated @xmath6 annihilations at the tevatron energies ( 1.96 tev ) .",
    "the following relation was used to retrieve the bec function @xmath7 from simulated data : @xmath8    where @xmath9 is a number of like - sign pairs with four momentum difference @xmath10 , @xmath11 are four - momenta of produced particles .",
    "@xmath12 is the number of pairs without bec .",
    "the reference sample can be created in two different ways .",
    "one can use the unlike - sign pairs from the same event or take the like - sign pairs from different events .",
    "both approaches were employed in the present work .",
    "+ the correlation procedure in pythia is based on the following assumptions .",
    "first of all , the @xmath13 value is evaluated for each pairs of produced particles with the mass @xmath14 .",
    "then the shifted @xmath15 is found as a solution of the following equation + @xmath16 using the chosen parameterization of @xmath7 function .",
    "in general , the shape of bec @xmath7 function is model dependent .",
    "the most simple form of goldhaber - like parametrization for @xmath7 [ 8 ] @xmath18 has been used for data fitting in lep and hera experiments . in formula",
    "( 3 ) , @xmath19 is the normalization factor , depending on multiplicity @xmath20 , @xmath21 is so - called the coherence strength factor , meaning @xmath22 for fully incoherent and @xmath23 for fully coherent sources ; the parameter @xmath24 is interpreted as a radius of the particle source , assumed to be spherical in this parameterisation @xmath25 $ ] . the linear term in ( 3 ) accounts for long - range correlations outside the region of bec .",
    "we use the @xmath7 function within @xmath26 approach [ 1,2 ] in the form : @xmath27,\\label{c2 kozlov}\\ ] ]    where the multiplicity @xmath20 depending factor @xmath19 is equal to : @xmath28 .",

    "we fit the simulated data from pythia with the most common @xmath7 function ( 3 ) at @xmath42 . in the first step",
    ", we reproduced the parameters @xmath21 and r , that had been put into pythia at the beginning of simulation .",
    "we have found out there are non - vanishing correlations between @xmath43 mesons even if we turn off the bec.therefore in the next analysis we take into account only @xmath44 and @xmath45 mesons .",

    "the green area around @xmath46 ( right plots ) is the area of the best reproduction of the parameters .",
    "it means , that the difference between input and output value of parameter @xmath47 in this area is approximately zero .",
    "the red area in right bottom side corresponds to @xmath48 and the blue area in top left side to @xmath49 .",

    "we blurred all components of momenta of each particle in accord with the cdf detector resolutions [ 10 ] .",
    "the pythia simulations show us , that a lot of pions have energy too small for reaching the hadron calorimeter .",
    "therefore we get new particle energies using blurred momenta and particles masses ( fig .",
    "3 ) , employing , for the blurring procedure , the realistic cdf tracking system resolution . +",
    "it is evident that taking into account realistic cdf detector resolutions we are able to observe the bec effects , although the @xmath7 function is less profound in this case .",
    "+ in fig 4 .",
    "one can see a decrease of the output parameter @xmath52 , taken as a function of the input parameter @xmath53 , with increasing cut on energy . for suppression of the decrease",
    "it is therefore important to register also low energy particles .",
