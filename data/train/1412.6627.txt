    "the structure and origin of the galactic disk(s ) are among the hottest debating issues of the galactic astronomy .",
    "an archeological approach to the problems relies on the collection of information in multi - dimensional phase space for large samples of stars .",
    "the on - going lamost spectroscopic survey of the galactic anti - center ( lss - gac ) , will collect medium - to - low resolution ( @xmath5 @xmath61800 ) spectra of millions of stars and deliver fundamental stellar parameters , including radial velocity ( @xmath0 ) and stellar atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature @xmath1 , surface gravity log@xmath2 , metallicity [ fe / h ] ) , as well as elemental abundance ratios ( the @xmath7element to iron abundance ratio [ @xmath8/fe ] , and the carbon to iron abundance ratio [ c / fe ] ) , deducible from the spectra ( liu et al .",
    "combined with accurate optical and infrared ( ir ) photometry , the lss - gac will also deliver estimates of the interstellar extinction and distances to individual stars ( yuan et al .",
    "2014 , submitted ; paperiii hereafter ) . together with determinations of proper motions , either from existing catalogs , such as the ppmxl ( roeser et al .",
    "2010 ) and ucac4 ( zacharias et al .",
    "2013 ) , or from the forth coming measurements of gaia of unprecedented accuracy ( perryman et al .",
    "2001 ) , as well as accurate parallaxes ( distances ) also provided by gaia , the lss - gac will provide an unprecedented large stellar database in multi - dimensional phase space to study the stellar populations , kinematics and chemistry of the galactic disk and its assemblage and evolution history .",
    "deriving accurate stellar parameters from millions of medium - to - low resolution fiber spectra in an efficient way is thus of fundamental importance to fulfill the scientific goals of lss - gac .",
    "various methods have been developed in the past to derive stellar atmospheric parameters from large number of medium - to - low resolution spectra ( recio - blanco et al .",
    "2006 ; lee et al .",
    "2008a , wu et al .",
    "the approaches generally fall into two main categories of method ( wu et al .",
    "2011 ) : the minimum distance method ( mdm ) and non - linear regression method . both categories of method have been applied to large stellar spectroscopic surveys , including the segue ( yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) , rave ( steinmetz et al .",
    "2006 ) , apogee ( majewski et al . 2007 ) and lamost ( zhao et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the mdm is usually based on spectral template matching , and searches for the template spectrum that has the shortest distance in parameter space from the target spectrum .",
    "the @xmath9 minimization , cross - correlation , weighted mean algorithm , and the @xmath10-nearest neighbor ( knn ) , are thought to be specific cases of mdm ( wu et al .",
    "softwares and pipelines developed based on those algorithms include the tgmet ( katz et al .",
    "1998 ) , matisse ( recio - blanco et al . 2006 ) , sspp ( lee et al .",
    "2008a ) , ulyss ( koleva et al .",
    "2009 ) , that of allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and of zwitter et al .",
    "the non - linear regression method is sometimes also referred to as the artificial neural network ( ann ) .",
    "the method constructs a functional mapping between the spectra and stellar atmospheric parameters by training a library of template spectra with non - linear algorithms such as the principal component analysis ( pca ) , and then apply the mapping to target spectra .",
    "related work can be found in re fiorentin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and lee et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "in addition to the above two categories of method , other approaches have been developed , for example , the line - index method based on the relations between the stellar atmospheric parameters and the equivalent widths of spectral features and/or photometric colours ( wilhelm et al .",
    "1999 ; beers et al . 1999 ; cenarro et al .",
    "more recently , a bayesian approach to determine stellar atmospheric parameters combing spectral and photometric measurements has been developed by schnrich & bergemann ( 2013 ) .",
    "different methods usually have different valid parameter ranges , outside which the methods perform poorly .",
    "for example , the line - index method usually loses sensitivity when the adopted metallic lines are either saturated or too weak . because stars are widely distributed in the parameter space and different spectral features have different sensitivity to the atmospheric parameters",
    ", one can hardly rely on one single method to derive stellar atmospheric parameters with a uniform accuracy for all types of star .",
    "a `` multi - method '' approach , which takes averaged stellar atmospheric parameters deduced from a variety of methods that utilizes different spectral wavelength ranges , is adopted by the sspp ( lee et al .",
    "since systematic errors from different methods can not be easily compared and combined , the systematic errors of the final parameters are difficult to estimate .",
    "almost all of the methods determine the stellar atmospheric parameters via either direct or indirect comparisons between the target and template spectra , a set of comprehensive templates of known parameters covering a broad parameter space are thus of fundamental importance .",
    "both libraries consisting of empirical and synthetic spectral templates have been used in the literature .",
    "lists of the currently available empirical and synthetic libraries can be found in wu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and at a website on stellar spectral libraries .",
    "an advantage of the empirical libraries is that they consist of spectra of @xmath11 stars .",
    "the disadvantage is that it is often laborious and time - consuming to build an empirical spectral library of stars of accurately known parameters that cover wide parameter ranges with sufficient resolution and homogeneity .",
    "it is clear that the parameter space encompassed by the existent empirical libraries are limited by our current knowledge of stars in the solar neighborhood and the available observations .",
    "on the other hand , while it may be straightforward to construct a set of synthetic spectra covering homogeneously a wide parameter space , it is difficult to assess the robustness of the spectra , especially those of very low ( @xmath12k ) or high temperatures ( for instance , stars of the o , b or a spectral types ) .",
    "properties of stellar spectra are determined not only by basic stellar parameters such as @xmath1 , log@xmath2 , [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath8/fe ] , but also depend on other parameters and processes such as the micro - turbulence and rotation velocities as well as convection .",
    "observational uncertainties combined with inadequacies in our understanding of stellar atmospheres may lead to unrealistic parameters @xmath1 , log@xmath2 , [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath8/fe ] by matching an observed medium - to - low resolution spectrum with a library of synthetic spectra .",
    "thanks to the efforts involving many observers , several empirical spectral libraries , including the elodie ( prugniel & soubiran 2001 ; prugniel et al .",
    "2007 ) and miles ( snchez - blzquez et al . 2006 ; falcn - barroso et al . 2011 ) , are now available .",
    "they cover a wide range of stellar parameters , accurately determined with high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "a pipeline , the lamost stellar parameter pipeline ( lasp ) , which is mainly based on the universit de lyon spectroscopic analysis software ( ulyss ; koleva et al . 2009 ; wu et al .",
    "2011 ) and makes use of the elodie library , has been developed and applied to the lamost spectra at the lamost operation and development center of the national astronomical observatories of chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ; wu et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the library is used to determine radial velocities as well as atmospheric parameters .",
    "parameters thus determined have been made available via the lamost official data release ( luo et al .",
    "2012 , bai et al .",
    "2014 ) .    as parts of the lss - gac survey , a pipeline ,",
    "the lamost stellar parameter pipeline at peking university ",
    "lsp3 , has been developed in parallel .",
    "similar to the lasp , the lsp3 determines stellar atmospheric parameters by template matching , but using the miles rather than the elodie empirical library instead .",
    "compared to the elodie spectra which are secured using an echelle spectrograph with a very high spectral resolution ( @xmath13 ; prugniel & soubiran 2001 ; prugniel et al .",
    "2007 ) , the miles spectra are obtained using a long - slit spectrograph at a spectral resolution ( fwhm@xmath14 ) comparable to that of the lamost spectra , and are accurately flux - calibrated to an accuracy of a few per cent over the @xmath1535257410 wavelength coverage .",
    "the stellar atmospheric parameters of miles spectra , determined in most cases using high resolution spectroscopy , have been calibrated to a uniform reference ( cenarro et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the radial velocities of miles stars are not as accurately determined as those in the elodie library , given the fairly low spectral resolution of miles spectra .",
    "thus for radial velocity determinations , the lsp3 continues to make use of the elodie library .",
    "the lsp3 has been successfully applied to hundreds of thousands spectra collected for the lss - gac survey .",
    "radial velocities and atmospheric parameters , together with other additional parameters such as estimates of interstellar extinction and distance to individual stars are released as value - added catalogs supplementary to the lamost official data release ( paperiii ) . in this work ,",
    "we introduce the algorithm and implementation of lsp3 in detail , and examine the accuracy of stellar parameters yielded by the lsp3 , by applying the lsp3 to the spectral templates themselves , to lamost multi - epoch spectra of duplicate stars and to lamost and sdss spectra of member candidates of open and globular clusters .",
    "parameters yielded by the lsp3 are compared extensively with independent determinations from a number of external databases , including the pastel archive and the apogee , sdss and rave surveys , as well as with values published in the lamost first data releases ( dr1 ; bai et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section2",
    ", we introduce template libraries adopted by the lsp3 .",
    "section3 describes the methodology of lsp3 in detail . in section4",
    ", we examine the lsp3 algorithm by applying it to the template spectra themselves . in section5",
    ", we discuss the precision and accuracy of lsp3 by comparing the results yielded by different algorithms and by multi - epoch observations of duplicate stars . in section6 , lsp3 stellar parameters are compared extensively with independent determinations from external databases .",
    "calibration and error estimates of lsp3 parameters are presented in section7 . in section8",
    ", we discuss the error sources of lsp3 stellar parameters .",
    "we close with a summary in section9 .",
    "the miles library consists of 985 stars spanning wide range of stellar atmospheric parameters .",
    "the spectra are obtained with the 2.5 m issac newton telescope , covering the wavelength range 3525  7500 at an almost constant resolution of full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of about 2.5 ( snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "2006 ; falcn - barroso et al . 2011 ) , which is slightly smaller than the typical fwhm of lamost spectra ( @xmath62.8 ) .",
    "the high accuracy of ( relative ) flux calibration ( snchez - blzquez et al . 2006 ) and wide coverage of stellar parameters that are homogeneously calibrated ( cenarro et al . 2007 ) make the miles an ideal empirical spectral library for stellar parameter determinations .",
    "the spectra are converted to match the lamost resolution by convolving with gaussians and resampled to 1.0 per pixel .",
    "the width of the gaussian , which is allowed to vary with wavelength , is taken to be the mean of all the 4000 fibers of lamost .",
    "the miles spectra are wavelength - calibrated to an accuracy of only approximately 10kms@xmath3 , not good enough for the purpose of radial velocity determinations for the lamost spectra .",
    "we have thus decided to use the elodie library as radial velocity templates .",
    "the library contains 1959 high - resolution spectra of 1388 stars , obtained with the elodie echelle spectrograph mounted on the observatoire de haute - provence 1.93 m telescope , covering wavelength range 3900  6800 at a resolving power of 42,000 ( prugniel & soubiran , 2001 ; prugniel et al .",
    "in addition to spectra of the original resolving power , the library also provides another set of spectra , degraded to a resolving power of 10,000 .",
    "we use the latter set of spectra .",
    "the spectra are further degraded in resolution to match that of the lamost and resampled to 1.0 per pixel . for stars with multiple spectra ,",
    "only the one flagged as the best is used .",
    "note that both the miles and elodie libraries provide spectra in rest laboratory wavelengths , calculated using radial velocities determined from the spectra . as a test of the accuracy of radial velocities adopted by the elodie , we cross",
    "- correlate the spectra with synthetic ones ( munari et al .",
    "2005 ) of identical stellar atmospheric parameters , and find an average velocity residual and standard deviation of @xmath160.7kms@xmath3 .",
    "the small value of standard deviation reflects the high resolution of elodie spectra and that the spectra are wavelength - calibrated to high a precision .",
    "the offset , @xmath17kms@xmath3 , is however significant .",
    "its origin is unclear . as shall be shown in section6.1 , we correct for any systematics in radial velocities determined with the elodie by calibrating the results against external databases . for comparison , a similar exercise for the miles library",
    "yields a residual of @xmath186.5kms@xmath3 .",
    "the above exercise also finds a few spectra in the elodie library that have very large velocity residuals .",
    "for spectra with residuals in excess of 3@xmath19 of the mean , we have applied corrections to the wavelengths using the above determined residuals .",
    "finally , given the scarce of stars of temperatures higher than 7000k , we have added 360 synthetic spectra ( munari et al .",
    "2005 ) with temperatures between 7000 and 12,000k to the elodie library as radial velocity templates .",
    "although the miles library has a decent coverage of the stellar parameter space , the coverage is not homogeneous and there are clusters and holes in the distribution of stars in the parameter space .",
    "fig.1 shows the distributions of miles stars in the @xmath1  log@xmath2 and @xmath1  [ fe / h ] planes . at @xmath205700k , for example , a number of stars cluster around [ fe / h ] @xmath60.1 and @xmath6@xmath21dex , but few at [ fe / h ] @xmath6@xmath22dex .",
    "the presence of clusters and holes in the distributions introduces patterns and biases in the resultant stellar atmospheric parameters derived by template matching .",
    "an observational campaign to fill the holes and to further expand the parameter space coverage , as well as to expand the template spectral wavelength coverage to 9200 to utilize the full potential of the lamost spectra , especially those from the red - arm , is well under way , using the naoc 2.16 m telescope and the 2.4 m telescope of the yunnan astronomical observatory . as a remedy for the time being ,",
    "we interpolate the miles spectra to fill up the apparent holes in parameter space .",
    "to do this , we first exclude 85 out of the 985 miles template stars that do not have a complete set of high quality parameters ( @xmath1 , log@xmath2 and [ fe / h ] ) . of the 900 stars left ,",
    "14 fall close the low log@xmath2 boundaries of the distribution in the @xmath1 ",
    "log@xmath2 plane and are also not used for the interpolation . to interpolate the spectra ,",
    "the remaining 886 stars are divided into four groups in the @xmath1  log@xmath2 plane ( table1 ) . for each group of stars ,",
    "a third - order polynomial of 20 coefficients , is used to fit the spectral flux density normalized to unity at 5400 at each wavelength as a function of stellar atmospheric parameters , @xmath1 , log@xmath2 and [ fe / h ] . here",
    "a third - order polynomial is selected as a compromise considering the fact that stellar spectra are a complicated function of atmospheric parameters and the limited number as well as parameter coverage of the miles templates .    to examine the uncertainties of interpolated spectra",
    ", we have applied the interpolation scheme to the templates themselves .",
    "specifically , we drop a template from the library , and fit the rest with the polynomial .",
    "the fit is then used to calculate the dropped spectrum at the given parameters . to characterize the goodness of fit",
    ", the dispersion of the relative differences between the interpolated and observed spectra , is calculated between 4320  5500 , the window the lsp3 adopts for estimating stellar parameters . when calculating the relative differences , the interpolated spectrum is allowed to scale with a third - order polynomial to match the sed of the observed one .",
    "the exercise is repeated for all template in the library .",
    "for fgk dwarfs , giants , cool dwarfs and hot stars , the mean and scatter of dispersion thus calculated for all templates in the library are 0.007@xmath230.003 , 0.013@xmath230.007 , 0.023@xmath230.012 and 0.020@xmath230.010 , respectively .",
    "fig.2 compares the interpolated and observed template spectra for four example stars , one from each of the four groups .",
    "compared to typical uncertainties of lamost spectra , the errors of interpolated templates due to fitting uncertainties are marginal , except for lamost spectra of very high snrs . we have also tried to interpolate the templates using the formula of prugniel et al .",
    "the results are generally comparable with each other .    to fill up some of the apparent holes in parameter space covered by the miles library , some fiducial spectra are created by interpolating the existing templates in parameter space . in total",
    ", 416 fiducial spectra are interpolated using the fits generated above and added to the miles library .",
    "the distributions of parameters of the interpolated spectra are over - plotted in fig.1 along with those of the original spectra . the resultant parameter coverage in @xmath1  [ fe / h ] plane , though still not fully homogeneous , is much improved . finally , for the purpose of spectral classification only",
    ", we have added 18 spectra of white dwarfs ( wds ) , carbon stars and late - m / l type stars retrieved from the sdss database to the final library of spectral templates used by the lsp3 ."
