    "the measurement of the @xmath0 forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry at tevatron  @xcite has motivated a plethora of models which attempt to accommodate the experimental values , up to @xmath3 larger than the prediction of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this task is not straightforward because the measured @xmath0 cross section is in good agreement with the sm : any `` generic '' addition to the @xmath0 production amplitude , large enough to produce the observed fb asymmetry , will easily give rise to too large a departure in the total rate .",
    "many of the proposed models circumvent this problem at the expense of a cancellation between ( linear ) interference and ( quadratic ) new physics terms in the total cross section , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the sm cross section , @xmath6 the one corresponding to the new physics and @xmath7 the interference term .",
    "the cancellation @xmath8 requires a new large amplitude @xmath9 which , obviously , should have observable effects elsewhere . the ideal candidate to search for these effects",
    "is the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "new physics in @xmath10 which produces such a large cancellation in the tevatron cross section will likely produce an observable enhancement in the @xmath0 tail at lhc , even if at this collider top pair production is dominated by gluon fusion .",
    "( the tail is also enhanced at tevatron energies but in the majority of the proposed models the deviations are compatible with present measurements  @xcite . ) in some cases , this effect should be visible already with the data collected in 2010 .",
    "conversely , if large deviations are not reported , a number of candidates to explain the tevatron @xmath0 asymmetry will be excluded from the list .    in this paper",
    "we make these arguments quantitative for a wide class of sm extensions .",
    "we consider general new vector bosons and scalars , classified by their transformation properties under the sm gauge group @xmath11 , and study their possible effects in @xmath0 production .",
    "we use effective field theory to consistently ( i ) integrate out the new heavy states and obtain their contribution to @xmath10 in terms of four - fermion operators ; ( ii ) obtain the cross sections in terms of effective operator coefficients .",
    "this allows us to find , for each vector boson and scalar representation , a relation between the possible values of the asymmetry @xmath12 at tevatron and the excess in the @xmath0 tail at lhc .",
    "the discussion of all possible vector boson and scalar representations within the model - independent effective operator framework allows us to make stronger statements than in other model - independent studies  @xcite . at the same time , any model with several vector bosons and scalars can be considered in our framework by simply summing the effective operator coefficients corresponding to the integration of each new particle .",
    "previous studies of lhc signals associated to the fb asymmetry within particular models have been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    after this analysis",
    ", we explore an alternative way to produce a large asymmetry with moderate effects in the @xmath0 tail at lhc .",
    "the key for this mechanism is the observation that one can also obtain a large @xmath12 without significant changes in the total @xmath0 cross section by introducing new physics which only contributes to the latter at quadratic order .",
    "this has been studied before , in the effective formalism , in ref .",
    "if we write @xmath13 for the forward ( f ) and backward ( b ) cross sections , the total rate is maintained at first order provided @xmath14 , which can be achieved , for example , with a new vector boson and a scalar . for models fulfilling this cancellation the size of the new physics contributions required to accommodate the experimental value of @xmath12 are smaller .",
    "therefore , these models provide a better agreement of the @xmath0 tail with tevatron measurements , and predict a much smaller tail at lhc , which is still potentially observable with forthcoming measurements .",
    "we remark that the use of effective field theory ( with the assumption that the new physics is too heavy to be directly produced at lhc ) does not limit much the generality of our conclusions . for @xmath15-channel exchange of new vector bosons or scalars , integrating out the new particles gives a good estimate for masses @xmath16 tev .",
    "for @xmath17-channel exchange this approximation is worse , but the cross section enhancement produced by the new particle(s ) is always larger than the one from the corresponding four - fermion operator(s ) , and in this sense our predictions are conservative . on the other hand ,",
    "if new physics in the @xmath0 tail is not seen at lhc , the new resonances are heavy and the effective operator framework can be safely used .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that we include @xmath18 corrections arising from the quadratic terms in new physics in the cross sections .",
    "the contributions from the interference of @xmath18 operators with the sm can be neglected , as they are suppressed with respect to the former for the values of parameters that are required to explain the @xmath0 asymmetry .",
    "there are ten possible @xmath11 representations  @xcite for new vector bosons contributing to @xmath10 , while for scalars eight representations contribute .",
    "they are collected in table  [ tab : lagr ] , where the first column indicates the label used to refer to them . and @xmath19 the normalisation in the lagrangian differs from ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor of two , to simplify the presentation of the limits . ]",
    "the relevant interaction lagrangian is included as well , indicating the symmetry properties , if any , of the coupling matrices @xmath20 .",
    "we use standard notation with left - handed doublets @xmath21 and right - handed singlets @xmath22 , @xmath23 ; @xmath24 are the pauli matrices , @xmath25 the gell - mann matrices normalised to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "the indices @xmath31 denote colour , and @xmath32 is the totally antisymmetric tensor .       for an @xmath17-channel @xmath33 we select @xmath34 as in the example of section  [ sec:3 ] , giving @xmath35 .",
    "we assume for @xmath33 a large width @xmath36 , and only consider masses above 1.5 tev .",
    "the @xmath0 asymmetry with the exact calculation is slightly above the one obtained with the effective operator approximation and , as anticipated , the tail cross section @xmath37 at lhc is up to one order of magnitude larger because of the @xmath38 propagator enhancement .",
    "we also display the value of @xmath37 for three @xmath33 masses @xmath39 tev and the @xmath30 values which reproduce @xmath35 in the exact calculation . with this example",
    "we can confirm that in this case our effective operator calculations are quite conservative and the effects of @xmath17-channel resonances can be much larger , depending on their mass and width .",
    "finally we perform a parton - level simulation including the @xmath0 pair decay to investigate a possible efficiency decrease at high @xmath40 due to forward scattering by new @xmath15-channel resonances  @xcite .",
    "the fraction of events in which the charged lepton is too forward or too soft to be detected can be measured by the ratio @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the total cross sections times semileptonic branching ratio and the primed quantities are the same but also requiring for the charged lepton a pseudo - rapidity @xmath43 and transverse momentum @xmath44 gev .",
    "we do not include jet acceptances since the rapidity coverage is much larger than for leptons , @xmath45 .",
    "keeping @xmath46 constant , we plot @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] for the new physics contributions ( four - fermion operators and @xmath15-channel @xmath1 ) as well as for the sm .",
    "it is clear that the acceptance decrease due to forward scattering is unimportant even for very small resonance masses due to the good rapidity coverage of the cms and atlas detectors .",
    "( this is in agreement with calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) nevertheless , for high @xmath0 invariant masses the reconstruction of boosted top quarks may have to be optimised in order to achieve a large overall efficiency .",
