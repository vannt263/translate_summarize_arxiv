    ", one can address those transitions , emphasizing in particular , a two - level system .",
    "this way , a number of effects can be obtained and some of them are known from pumping of real atoms with coherent laser fields .",
    "particularly , resonance fluorescence from a coherently driven semiconductor quantum dot in a cavity was experimentally investigated in @xcite .",
    "the observation of the mollow triplet @xcite from a quantum dot system was reported in @xcite .",
    "dephasing of triplet - sideband optical emission of a resonantly driven inas / gaas quantum dot inside a microcavity was studied in ref .",
    "furthermore , cascaded single - photon emission from the mollow triplet sidebands of a quantum dot as well as spectral photon correlations were obtained in @xcite .",
    "a pronounced interaction between the quantum dot and the cavity has been observed even for detunings of many cavity linewidths @xcite . in the small rabi frequency regime , subnatural",
    "linewidth single photons from a quantum dot were obtained too , in @xcite .",
    "moreover , self - homodyne measurement of a dynamic mollow triplet in the solid state systems was performed recently @xcite .",
    "when two or more quantum dots are close to each other on the emission wavelength scale then collective interactions come into play @xcite .",
    "in particular , superradiance in an ensemble of quantum dots was experimentally observed in @xcite while the dynamics of quantum dot superradiance was investigated in @xcite . the collective fluorescence and decoherence of a few nearly identical quantum dots and superbunched photons via a strongly pumped near - equispaced multi - particle system were analyzed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",

    "@xcite .    here , we investigate the dynamics of a two - level quantum dot ensemble inside a microcavity",
    ". however , the developed approach applies to a real atomic sample as well .",
    "the microcavity mode together with the qubit subsystem are pumped with two distinct coherent electromagnetic fields . when the laser that resonantly pumps the qubit ensemble is moderately intense , i.e. the corresponding rabi frequency is larger than the qubit - cavity coupling strength as well as the spontaneous and cavity decay rates , we found enhanced photon - photon correlations .",
    "in particular , the photon statistics displays oscillatory steady - state behaviors due to an interplay between the cavity and sponatenous emission decay rates . furthermore , the microcavity photon statistics depends on the phase difference of the applied coherent sources that can be a convenient mechanism to influence the second - order photon - photon correlations .",
    "an asymmetrical steady - state behavior of the second - order photon correlation function versus cavity - field detuning is observed due to the relative phase dependence .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the analytical approach and the system of interest , and obtain the corresponding equations of motion .",
    "section iii deals with discussions of the obtained results .",

    "the hamiltonian describing a wavelength - sized collection of pumped two - level artificial ( or real ) atomic system possessing the frequency @xmath0 and embedded in a microcavity of frequency @xmath1 is : @xmath2 here , both the atomic sample , and the microcavity mode , are interacting with coherent sources of frequency @xmath3 , in a frame rotating at @xmath4 , and we have assumed that @xmath5 . in the hamiltonian ( [ hm ] )",
    "the first term describes the cavity free energy with @xmath6 , while the second one characterize the interaction of the quantum dot system with the microcavity mode via the coupling @xmath7 .",
    "the third term takes into account the interaction of the microcavity mode with the first coherent light source of amplitude @xmath8 and phase @xmath9 .",
    "the last term considers the interaction of the qubit subsystem with the second laser with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the corresponding rabi frequency and phase .",
    "the collective operators @xmath12=@xmath13 and @xmath14^{\\dagger}$ ] obey the commutation relations for su(2 ) algebra : @xmath15=2s_{z}$ ] and @xmath16=\\pm s^{\\pm}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath17 is the number of quantum dots involved . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the excited and ground state of the @xmath20th qubit , respectively .",
    "further , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the creation and the annihilation operator of the electromagnetic field ( emf ) , and satisfy the standard bosonic commutation relations , i.e. , @xmath23=1 $ ] , and @xmath24=[a^{\\dagger},a^{\\dagger}]=0 $ ] .",
    "we have supposed here that the quantum dot system couples to the laser and microcavity fields with the same coupling strength , i.e. the linear extension of the quantum dot ensemble is smaller than the relevant emission wavelength .    in what follows ,",
    "we are interested in the laser dominated regime where @xmath25 ( here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the spontaneous and cavity decay rates , respectively ) and shall describe our system using the dressed - states formalism @xcite : @xmath28 before applying the transformation ( [ ds ] ) we performed the substitution @xmath29 and @xmath30 and dropped the tilde afterwards . restricting ourselves to values of @xmath31 and secular approximation , one then arrives at the following master equation describing our system : @xmath32 = -\\gamma_{0}[r_{z},r_{z}\\rho ]   -\\gamma\\{[r^{+},r^{-}\\rho ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & [ r^{-},r^{+}\\rho]\\ } -\\kappa[a^{\\dagger},a\\rho ] + h.c .. \\label{me}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the single - qubit spontaneous decay rate , while @xmath40 is the quantum dot dephasing rate .",
    "the new quasispin operators , i.e. @xmath41 , @xmath42^{\\dagger}$ ] and @xmath43 are operating in the dressed state picture .",
    "they obey the following commutation relations : @xmath44=r_{z}$ ] and @xmath45=\\pm 2r^{\\pm}$ ] .",
    "notice the dependence of the coupling strength @xmath46 on the phase difference of the applied coherent sources .",
    "additional and different phase dependent effects can be found in @xcite .    in the next subsection",
    ", we shall obtain the equations of motion of variables of interest in order to calculate the second - order microcavity photon correlation function : @xmath47 .",
    "values of @xmath48 smaller than unity describe sub - poissonian photon statistics and it is a quantum effect .",
    "poissonian photon - statistics has @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 characterizes super - poissonian photon statistics .",
    "in particular for thermal light one has @xmath51 and , therefore , we are interested in correlations larger than two , i.e. @xmath52 .      using eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) one can obtain the following equations of motion in order to calculate the microcavity photon intensity and their second - order photon - photon correlations : @xmath53 the system of equations ( [ eqm ] ) is not complete .",
    "additional equations are necessary for the qubit subsystem operators @xmath54 , @xmath55 etc .",
    "however , we shall represent the steady - state expectation values of the field correlators @xmath56 and @xmath57 via the quantum dot operators alone .",
    "the expectation values of the quantum dot operators will be evaluated in a different way as described in the next subsection .",
    "note that in deriving the above system of equations we have used the relation : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "as it was mentioned in the previous subsection , the steady - state values of field correlators as well as the qubit - field correlators can be expressed via the expectation values of the dressed - state inversion @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "these qubit - subsystem operators can be obtained from the master equation ( [ me ] ) by observing that any diagonal form of operators @xmath62 , @xmath63 , commute with @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the steady - state values of these operators are determined only by the dissipation part of the master equation .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the steady - state solution of the qubit subsystem master equation is @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the unity operator .",
    "consider an atomic coherent state @xmath67 , denoting a symmetrized @xmath68-atom state in which @xmath69 particles are in the lower dressed state @xmath70 and @xmath71 atoms are excited to the upper dressed state @xmath72 .",
    "one can calculate the expectation values of any atomic correlators of interest using the relations : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",

    "the general expression for the second - order photon correlation function is too cumbersome and , therefore , we shall represent it analytically for few particular cases . if @xmath92 one has @xmath49 while when @xmath93 we have : @xmath94 one can observe here that the second - order correlation function does not depend on microcavity - dot coupling strength @xmath46 .",
    "this is the case also for @xmath79 and @xmath95 .",
    "however , in general , i.e. when @xmath96 , the microcavity photon correlation function depends on @xmath46 . note that the two - photon correlator @xmath97 while the photon intensity @xmath98 and , thus , we have an enhancement of these correlations due to collectivity .    in what follows , using the system of equations ( [ eqm ] ) and for some particular cases the expression ( [ g20 ] ) , we shall describe in details the microcavity second - order photon correlation function for various parameters of interest .",
    "we proceed by considering that the microcavity mode is not additionally pumped , i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "figure ( [ fig-1 ] ) shows the dependence of the second - order correlation function as a function of @xmath78 for various cavity detunings and number of quantum dots involved . at the exact resonance , that is @xmath80",
    ", one can observe larger photon correlations , i.e. @xmath99 , while their intensity is being also enhanced due to collectivity .",
    "the picture is different for the off - resonance case .",
    "as long as @xmath100 the photon statistics is similar to that of a thermal light , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "however , for intermediate detunings one can observe a oscillatory behavior of the second - order correlation function due to the interplay of @xmath27 and @xmath101 . as the detuning",
    "is further increased the two - photon correlation shows a dip because of the off - resonant driving ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig-1](b ) does not change if one further increase the number of quantum dots .    to further understand the steady - state behaviors of the photon - photon correlation function for @xmath96 , in figure  ( [ fig-2 ] ) we plot @xmath48 again .",
    "however in this case , one observes a dependence of the normalized second - order correlation function @xmath48 on the phase difference @xmath102 of the applied coherent sources .",
    "it is easy to show that the microcavity photon intensity ( see eqs .  [ eqm ] ) @xmath103\\kappa } \\label{its}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] does not depend on @xmath102 in this particular case .",
    "therefore , the phase difference appears in the unnormalized second - order correlator @xmath104 .",
    "this happens due to feasibility of scattering two photons from different applied coherent sources giving rise to interferences , i.e. , phase dependent effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig-2](a ) one can observe an asymmetrical steady - state behavior of the second - order correlation function for @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , the maximum at @xmath80 for @xmath85 turns into a minimum for @xmath87 ( see the solid and short - dashed curves in fig .  [ fig-2]a , respectively ) .",
    "thus , the relative phase between the applied coherent sources can be a convenient tool to manipulate the photon statistics .",
    "particularly , one can generate coherent light , i.e. @xmath105 , despite of spontaneous incoherent photon scattering into the cavity mode ( see fig .  [",
    "fig-2]b ) .",
    "again , the photon intensity as well as their second - order correlations are enhanced due to collectivity .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the interaction of a collection of laser - pumped artificial atoms embedded in a leaking optical microcavity . particularly , we were interested in photon statistics of the scattered photons into the cavity mode .",
    "we have found that the photon statistics depends on the phase difference between the coherent sources pumping the quantum dot system and the cavity mode , respectively .",
    "various steady - state behaviors of photon correlations were shown to occur .",
