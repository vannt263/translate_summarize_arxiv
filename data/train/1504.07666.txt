    "many natural , social and economic phenomena follow power laws .",
    "it has been previously ascertained that the distribution of incomes @xcite , size of cities @xcite , evolution of human language @xcite , internet and genetic networks @xcite , and scientific publications and citations @xcite , all follow power laws . finding a complete theory for describing these kind of systems",
    "seem an impractical task , given the huge amount of degrees of freedom involved these social systems .",
    "notwithstanding , remarkable regularities were reported and studied , such as zipf s law @xcite , or the celebrated gibrat s law of proportional growth @xcite , which constitutes important milestones on the quest for a unified framework that mathematically describe predictable tendencies .",
    "firm size distributions ( fsd ) are the outcome of the complex interaction among several economic forces .",
    "entry of new firms , growth rates , business environment , government regulations , etc . , may shape different fsd .",
    "the underlying dynamics that drives the distribution of firms sizes is still an issue under intense scrutiny . according to gaffeo et al .",
    "@xcite , there is an active debate going on among industrial organization s scholars , in which log - normal , pareto , weibull , or a mixture of them , compete for the best - fitting distributions of fsd .",
    "one of the controversial issues is the very definition of `` size '' , which can be measured by different proxies such as annual sales , number of employees , total assets , etc .    the seminal contribution by gibrat @xcite initiated a research line concerning the formal model that governs firms sizes and industry structure .",
    "the introduction of a theoretical model that would underlie the industrial demography could be of great help for authorities interested in maintaining fair competence and/or antitrust policies .",
    "hart and prais @xcite find , using a database of large firms , that average growth rates and sizes are independent variables .",
    "quandt @xcite states that pareto s distribution is often rejected when analyzing industries sub - sectors .",
    "other independent empirical studies , carried out by simon and bonnini @xcite , mansfield @xcite , and bottazzi and secchi @xcite , among others , confirm that firms growth rates are not related to firm size and that fsd follow a log - normal distribution . jacquemin and cardon de lichtbuer @xcite study the degree of firms and industry concentration in british firms using fortune s 200 largest industrial companies outside the united states , ranked according to sales .",
    "this study detects an increasing degree of concentration .",
    "kwasnicki @xcite affirms that skewed size distributions could be found even in the absence of economies of scale , and that the shape of the distribution is the outcome of innovation in firms .",
    "in particular , according to his simulations , cost improving innovations generate pareto - like skewed distributions .",
    "this work also reconciles the finding by ijiri and simon @xcite about the concavity toward the origin of the log - log rank size plot .",
    "such concavity could be produced by the evolutionary forces and innovation in the market .",

    "similar results are found empirically for dutch companies by marsili @xcite . on contrary ,",
    "vining @xcite had argued that the origin of the concavity is the existence of decreasing returns to scale .",
    "segal and spivak @xcite develop a theoretical model in which , under the presence of bankruptcy costs , the rate of growth of small firms is prone to be higher and more variable than that of larger firms .",
    "the same model also predicts that , for the largest firms , the sequence of growth rates is convergent satisfying gibrat s law , namely @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the size of the @xmath3th firm at time @xmath4 , @xmath5 its change in time , and @xmath6 a size - independent growth rate .",
    "this model is consistent with some previous empirical evidence , as that of mansfield @xcite .",
    "sutton @xcite has published a review of the literature on markets structure , highlighting the current challenges concerning fsd modelling .    during the 1990s ,",
    "the interest in fsd experienced a revamp , with the availability of new data - bases .",
    "a drawback of early studies was a biased selection of firms .",

    "axtell @xcite , using census data for all us firms , encounters that the fsd is right skewed , giving support for the workings of pareto s law .",
    "a similar finding is due to cabral and mata @xcite for portuguese manufacturing firms , although a log - normal distribution underestimates the skewness of the distribution and is not suitable for its lower tail . in this line",

    "@xcite find that , for pharmaceutical firms in 21 countries , and for us publicly traded firms , growth rates exhibit a central - portion distributed according to a laplace distribution , with power law tails .",
    "palestrini @xcite agrees with a power law distribution for firm sizes , although he models firm growth as a laplace distribution , that could change over business cycles .    according to riccaboni",
    "@xcite , the simultaneous study of firm sizes and growth presents an intrinsic difficulty , arising from two facts : ( i ) the size distribution follows a pareto law and ( ii ) firms growth rate is independent of the firm s size .",
    "this latter property is known as the `` law of proportionate effect '' .",
    "growiec et al .",
    "@xcite study firms growth and size distributions using firms business units as units of measurements .",

    "one can fairly assert that the concomitant literature has not yet reached a consensus regarding what model could best fit empirical data .",
    "an overview of several alternative models is detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and references therein .",
    "as shown in the above literature review , previous attempts to model growth and sizes of firms have not been entirely successful . in particular , there is a dispute concerning the underlying stochastic process that steers fsd . a possible solution in terms of agent - based model was proposed @xcite ; these models are remarkable as descriptive tools , but they do not furnish an overall panorama because are single - purpose models . besides , they are sensitive to the initial conditions , and , in some cases , their outcome depends on the length of the simulation time .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , to develop a thermodynamic - like theoretical model , able to capture typical features of firms distributions .",
    "we try to uncover the putative universal nature of fsd , which could be characterized by general laws , independent of `` microscopic '' details .",
    "secondly , to validate our theoretical model using an extensive database of spanish manufacturing firms during a long time - period .",
    "this paper contributes to the literature in several aspects .",
    "first , it provides an explanation for the stochastic distribution of firms sizes .",
    "the understanding of fsd is relevant for economic policy because it deals with market concentration , and thus , with competition and antitrust policy measures for example , naldi @xcite exhibits a relationship between zipf s law and some concentration indices .",
    "second , we apply our model to a large sample of spanish firms .",
    "third , this work expands the literature on industrial economics modelling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we present the theoretical framework and perform numerical experiments to validate our analytic approach .",
    "then , we show the empirical application to the spanish firms .",
    "finally , we draw some discussions and conclusions of our work .",
    "our framework is based on two fundamental hypothesis :    1 .   a micro - economic dynamical hypothesis for individual firm growth ; and 2 .",
    "using the maximum entropy principle , with dynamical prior information , for describing macroeconomic equilibrium .",
    "for the micro - economical hypothesis , we assume gibrat s law of proportional growth ( eq . ) as the main mechanism underlying firms size evolution .",
    "a finite - size term , due to the central limit theorem @xcite , becomes dominant for medium and small sizes , being proportional to the square root of the size .",
    "in addition to these two terms , we also assume that non - proportional forces become eventually effective , being dominant for the smallest sizes .",
    "thus , our full dynamical equation is written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are independent growth rates .",
    "it is expected that the growth rates are of a stochastic nature .",
    "thus , a _ temperature _ can be defined from their variance @xmath12 $ ] . accordingly , assuming that the variation in the growth rates is much larger than the variation in the observable @xmath13 as done in refs . @xcite",
    " the variance of the growth for several realizations becomes @xmath14 = t_{1 } |x|^2 + t_{1/2}|x| + t_{0}.\\ ] ] this equation defines three regimes , according to the size : small sizes @xmath15 ; medium sizes @xmath16 ; and large sizes @xmath17 .",
    "because of the existence of the non - proportional term , @xmath13 is allowed to eventually take negative values .",
    "this defines an additional set of temperatures for the negative domain , which in principle can be independent of those at the positive one .",
    "since all these temperatures can be measured from the raw data , their properties can be empirically determined . in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple ] we show a conceptual sketch of the ensemble of firms evolving in time as random walkers along the different regimes , with the corresponding temperature and dynamics for each of them .      for an ensemble of firms following eq .",
    ", we assume that dynamical equilibrium is asymptotically reached when some macroscopic constraints are obeyed .",
    "we cite the average total number of firms @xmath18 , the typical wealthiness of a given particular region , or any other objective observable . in view of the success of an entropic procedure for describing equilibrium distributions in other social systems ( as , e.g. , city population distributions )",
    ", we take as our macroeconomic hypothesis the principle of maximum entropy ( maxent ) with dynamical prior information @xcite , to predict the equilibrium density of the system .",
    "we focus our analytic derivation on that particular regime that has received most attention in the literature : the proportional growth - one : @xmath17 for the largest sizes . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the entropy of a system following gibrat s law is measured in terms of the new dynamical variable @xmath19 $ ] ( where @xmath20 is some reference value , in our case , the transition size @xmath21 ) which linearizes the dynamical equation as @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we write the macroscopic entropy for the system s density distribution @xmath23 for @xmath18 firms as @xmath24 = -\\int du \\rho(u ) \\log[\\rho(u)/n],\\ ] ] the equilibrium density is obtained by extremization of @xmath25 under the empirical constraints @xcite , such as the total number of firms , the minimum size of a firms , among others .",
    "lacking them , as sometimes happens in physics , we will use a symmetry criterion @xcite : employ constraints that preserve a symmetry of scale of @xmath26 , i.e. translation symmetry in @xmath27 . for this",
    ", we define an _ energy function _ , @xmath28 $ ] , that depends on powers of the dynamical variable @xmath29 , namely @xmath30 = \\sum_n\\lambda_n\\int du \\rho(u ) ( u-\\langle u \\rangle)^n:= \\sum_n\\lambda_n m_n,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are the central moments of @xmath32 and @xmath33 the coupling constants .",
    "the maximization problem is written as @xmath34-\\beta\\mathcal{e}[\\rho ] ) = 0 $ ] , where @xmath35 is a lagrange multiplier ( @xmath36 become then the multipliers for each term ) , and the general solution is of the form @xmath37 .",
    "\\label{eq : rhomaxent}\\ ] ] the values of the multipliers are obtained by solving the system of lagrange equations , @xmath38 for the distribution of eq . .",
    "we consider , for simplicity , the linear regime with only the first two moments @xmath39 ( a constraint on the average total number of firms @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 ( a constraint on the mean value @xmath42 written as @xmath43 ) .",
    "since the equations are formally equivalent to those found in thermodynamics , and traditionally the multipliers associated with these constraints are @xcite @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , we have a thermodynamic potential @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the variational problem becomes @xmath49=0 $ ] .",
    "we obtain the distribution @xmath50 the distribution is cast in terms of the observable @xmath13 as @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "accordingly , we obtain a power law density .",
    "useful for analyzing the empirical data is the complementary of the cumulative distribution @xmath54 , that reads @xmath55 the solutions of the lagrange equations lead to @xmath56 and to the _ equation of state _ :",
    "@xmath57 this is the relevant equation for interpreting the empirical data , since @xmath58 can be measured from the data and @xmath59 can be interpreted thanks to the thermodynamic analogy .    indeed , comparing our results with those of a physical system",
    ", one can identify @xmath60 with the chemical potential .",
    "we interpret @xmath60 as the `` cost '' for including / creating or excluding / extinguishing firms in the proportional large - size regime .",
    "following maxent @xcite , the system is in contact with a reservoir of firms , and tends to minimize @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath62 , for @xmath63 any new firm , in the proportional regime , decreases @xmath61 , making it more likely the emergence of a flow of firms entering into the system . however , for @xmath64 , any new firm will increase the value of @xmath61 , allowing for a flow of firms exiting the system . in the particular case",
    "@xmath65 there is no cost for the flow of firms , in what we expect to be an equilibrium , stable , and healthy situation for a capitalist economy .",
    "the thermodynamic variable @xmath66 defines the exponent of the distribution , and can be interpreted as a measure of the typical wealth of a region .",
    "specifically , it determines the scale of the size of firms , because it constraints the geometric mean of @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , the use of the geometric mean instead of the mean is common for systems with scale invariance , where long - tailed distributions have undefined moments but well - defined log - moments @xcite .",
    "this value will change from one economy to other one .",
    "thanks to the equation of state eq .",
    ", we can provide an intuitive , physically - based interpretation of that exponent :    * for @xmath67 ( @xmath64 ) the system favors the extinction of firms ; * for @xmath68 ( @xmath63 ) the system favors the creation of firms ; * for @xmath69 ( @xmath65 ) the system freely creates and extinguishes firms .",
    "this last particular case corresponds to the zipf s law distribution , namely @xmath70",
    "in aim of testing our theoretical procedure we have performed numerical experiments in terms of random walkers via a monte carlo simulation ( mc ) . at the initial time , the @xmath18 random walkers are randomly located using a uniform distribution .",
    "we assume independent stochastic wiener coefficients for different firms , within each of the three regimes or , more explicitly , @xmath71 where @xmath72 defines the specific dynamical regime , as in eq . .",
    "in order to make explicit the mechanisms that govern the dynamics , we will use a reduced approach , in which each of the regimes , according to the size @xmath13 , evolves independently .",
    "therefore , instead of simulating the whole dynamics , i.e. eq . , we aim to understand the particular contribution of each term in that equation .",
    "henceforth , we will focus in the interplay between the linear and proportional growth regimes , disregarding the intermediary regime . to achieve this goal , we use the following equation for the microscopic dynamics : @xmath73 where @xmath20 defines the border between the linear and the proportional regimes .",
    "since the number of walkers in the proportional regime is not constrained , we follow here the given recipe for a grand canonical ensemble @xcite where @xmath60 is fixed and the fluctuation in the number of walkers is determined by the probabilities of including ( @xmath74 ) or extracting ( @xmath75 ) a walker as @xmath76 according to these probabilities , in an ensemble with @xmath77 any walker can leave or enter into the system without any restriction . additionally , following eq .",
    "the constraint @xmath78 should be fulfilled .",
    "we have performed several realizations with different initial conditions , and let the system evolve until reaching equilibrium . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_rank ] , we show the rank plot , eq . , for different simulation times , measured in mc steps . here",
    "we choose @xmath79 .",
    "we see that the equilibrium distribution ( for @xmath80 mc cycles ) follows the zipf s law .",
    "moreover , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_rank ] the chemical potential for the equilibrium distribution .",
    "we see that , up to some fluctuations , the constraint @xmath81 is respected .",
    "we find that the equilibrium distribution does not depend on the initial conditions , and follows zipf s law : for large values , the complementary of the cumulative distribution follows eq .",
    ", as predicted by our thermodynamic framework .",
    "the distribution deviates from the analytic result , eq .",
    ", as the size of @xmath13 reaches the transition critical valued @xmath20 . in view of these results ,",
    "we numerically validate our analytic procedure .",
    "in order to empirically verify our theoretical model , we consider the spanish sabi database @xcite , which is a comprehensive one for all firms that have the obligation to disclose balance sheets in the spanish mercantile register .",
    "our sample consists of @xmath0 firms along a decade , with more than @xmath82 firms per year .",
    "we select those firms which have been active at any time during the last 10 years and use as our observable @xmath2 for the @xmath3th firm at year @xmath4 the so - called earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation , and amortization ( ebitda ) .",
    "this quantity is widely employed for assessing companies performances .",
    "it is homogeneous across companies and is not affected by different forms of financing .",
    "we believe that our proxy for size is a clear indicator of both corporate performance and size .",
    "we first test our microscopic dynamical hypothesis by measuring the variance of the ebitda growth for each year . since the ebitda values can be negative , we study separately positive and negative domains .",
    "we first analyze all the spanish firms in the same set , displaying in fig .",
    "[ fig : spain ] the dependence of the growth - variance on the ebitda for the year 2009 .",
    "we find a remarkable match to eq .",
    "for both positive and negative domains .",
    "the transition to proportional growth takes place , in this case , at @xmath83 euro .",
    "additionally , in both domains , the linear regime temperature , @xmath84 , is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "as shown in the supporting information , all the available data for 10 years match eq . , with slightly changing temperatures .",
    "a similar analysis , made per each spanish autonomous community , shows that the dynamics is also obeyed individually by regions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : communities ] .",
    "we do not find any exception for all the 15 spanish autonomous communities during these 10 years . in view of these results ,",
    "we empirically confirm the validity of the dynamical equation .",
    "additionally , we find that the temperatures @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the negative domain are significantly higher than those for the positive one .",
    "remarkable , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : temperatures ] , @xmath84 can be considered the same for positive and negative ebitda , indicating that the same non - proportional regime is connecting both domains .      once the dynamical equation has been validated , we pass to the rank - distributions .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : spain_rank ] the complementary cumulative function @xmath87 for all spanish firms in 2009 , including those with positive and negative ebitda .",
    "we observe that for large values of this function the power law eq . is followed , as predicted by our thermodynamic equilibrium hypothesis , with an exponent very close to that of zipf s law @xmath69 . for smaller values ,",
    "the distribution deviates from the power law .",
    "we have checked that this deviation takes place at about the same transition value @xmath21 , as predicted by our numerical experiments .",
    "this is a compelling evidence for the relation between the dynamics and the distribution given by our theoretical framework .",
    "we also measure the chemical potential @xmath59 , via the equation of state eq . .",
    "this chemical potential is , in general , with some deviations , close to @xmath65 , value for which the creation / extinction of firms has no cost for the energy potential function @xmath88 .",
    "we find the same picture when studying the firms distribution per each community .",
    "in general , all distributions are very close to the zipf s regime . in view of these results",
    ", we consider that our theoretical framework properly describes the dynamics and equilibrium of the ensemble of spanish firms .",
    "some interesting assertions can be made with regards to our theoretical framework .",
    "the most relevant , the thermodynamic interpretation of the exponent @xmath58 of the long - tail in size distribution .",
    "thanks to the equation of state eq .",
    "we provide for the first time a clear explanation of this exponent , linking that adimensional number with a dynamical , intuitive mechanism as the cost to the system of creating or extinguish a firm , measured by the chemical potential @xmath59 .",
    "this interpretation can be used to measure the macroscopic effect of particular economical policies , and to measure how healthy is a capitalist - based economy .",
    "we find that , in general , the value of @xmath59 in spanish regions is close to zero as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spain_rank] indicating the freedom of creating or extinguishing a firm .",
    "additionally , we settle here the form of the microscopic dynamics by eq . , and its dependence with the size .",
    "contrarily to other social systems following proportional growth @xcite , here exists the possibility of _ negative _ values .",
    "this requires an additional dynamical mechanism for the evolution of firms , that is successfully included in our current approach as a linear term dominant for small sizes .",
    "firms can be classified according to the dynamical regime , even if they are in the negative ( losses ) or positive ( gain ) domain . in a pictorial way",
    ", we can talk about _ heaven _ ( positive proportional regime ) , _ hell _ ( negative proportional regime ) , or _",
    "( linear regime ) .",
    "the fact that the temperatures in the positive domain are systematically smaller than in the negative one , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : temperatures ] , can be summarized as _ hell is warmer than heaven_. thus , a firm in _ hell _ losses money in a faster fashion than it would equivalently earn it in _",
    "we also find useful as macroeconomic indicator the position of the transition zone between medium and proportional growth regime in the negative domain , that gives an estimate of the minimum losses a firm can afford before going bankrupt or metaphorically , the _ hell s gate_. similarly , the same transition but in the positive domain provides an estimation of the success region for firms that we might wish to call _ heaven s door_. fig . [",
    "fig : transition ] shows both transition values from 2003 to 2012 as measured by the respective temperature ratios @xmath89 .",
    "we observe that , before the 2008 global financial crisis , both transitions were approximately equivalent in size , exhibiting a symmetry between positive and negative regimes .",
    "right before this crisis , the negative value reached its maximum , indicating some abnormal economic growth , potentially related with the speculative bubble .",
    "the confidence interval for this specific year is higher than the absolute value , indicating that this phenomenon did not happen with the same intensity among all the autonomous communities .",
    "finally , in the succeeding years , the negative value was reduced to a half , augmenting the probability of firms to go bankrupt ; whereas the positive transition also decreased , although not as rapidly as in the negative domain . after the burst of the crisis ,",
    "both transitions tend to converge again to a similar value , but lower than before the crisis . because the equation of state eq . and the constrained value of @xmath42 , this lower value reflects a general reduction of the wealth in the whole system , because it diminishes , on average , the scale of the successful firms at the proportional regime .    as a final remark",
    ", the numerical simulation provided here based on walkers under the grand canonical ensemble opens the possibility of developing simulation tools where economical forces can be introduced in the same fashion as done for physical forces for gases and liquids .",
    "indeed , we open a bridge between the mathematical tools used in statistical mechanics and firms dynamics .",
    "our analytic and numerical procedures can be used to deeply analyze the empirical data measuring and parameterizing the economic forces in play , and develop a full quantitative theory about these dynamics .",
    "work in this line is in progress .",
    "we advanced in this paper a complete thermodynamic framework which accommodates the firm size distribution of a given region .",
    "we propose an empirically proof a microscopic dynamical hypothesis , and show how the firms obey the maximum entropy principle at the macroscopic level .",
    "we analytically proof the connection between microscopic dynamics and equilibrium firm s size - distributions via maxent , and formulate the equation of state that relates the exponent of the long tail in size distributions with a well - known thermodynamic observable as the chemical potential .",
    "this lead to a clear and intuitive interpretation of the exponents , showing that can be used to measure the health of a economy .",
    "indeed , the emergence of zipf s law is associated with the free cost to the system of creating and extincting firms , as expected in a capitalist - based economy .",
    "all these theoretical considerations have been validated by comparison with empirical data concerning spanish firms , in a window of a decade .",
    "we expect this work to be a first step towards the formalization of a theory of the evolution of firms that will yield underlying forces and laws of evolution .",

    "<S> indeed , our model predicts that when the exponent is larger that 1 , creation of firms is favored ; when it is smaller that 1 , destruction of firms is favored instead ; and when it equals 1 ( matching zipf s law ) , the system is in a full macroeconomic equilibrium , entailing `` free '' creation and/or destruction of firms . for medium and smaller firm - sizes , the dynamical regime changes ; the whole distribution can no longer be fitted to a single simple analytic form and numerical prediction is required . </S>",
    "<S> our model constitutes the basis of a full predictive framework for the economic evolution of an ensemble of firms that can be potentially used to develop simulations and test hypothetical scenarios , as economic crisis or the response to specific policy measures . </S>"
