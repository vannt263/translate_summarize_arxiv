    "magnetic molecules offer the prospect of encoding and storing information in their magnetic state .",
    "the latter point applies , in particular , to bistable molecules such as single molecule magnets ( smms ) .",
    "the possibility to store , e.g. , one bit of information in the state of a single molecule would constitute an enormous degree of miniaturization and could lead to data storage technologies with significantly increased areal density .",
    "@xcite however , to make a ( potentially elusive ) technological application feasible , the molecules need to be individually addressable so that their magnetic state can be probed and manipulated on a molecule - by - molecule basis . in the last years",

    "@xcite while such an approach might solve the problem of addressability , it can introduce new complications due to interactions between the molecules and the surface . depending on details such as the molecule s ligands , the presence of an additional decoupling layer , and , of course , the characteristics of the surface",
    ", the interaction with the substrate might alter the magnetic properties of the molecule in an important ( and possibly adverse ) way .",
    "thus , even if the magnetic response of the isolated molecule is well understood ( e.g. , through a description by a suitable spin model @xcite ) , its magnetic properties in contact with the surface have to be reinvestigated .    in this article",
    ", we study a single - channel kondo impurity model with non - zero magnetic field and additional uniaxial anisotropy @xmath11 for the impurity spin operator @xmath12 . such an anisotropy term ( along with transverse anisotropy @xmath13 $ ] )",

    "@xcite the quantum impurity model is intended to serve as a minimal representation of an anisotropic magnetic molecule on a non - magnetic metallic substrate and , with transverse anisotropy @xmath14 , has already been used to describe smms interacting with metallic electrodes .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it has been found that the above uniaxial and transverse anisotropy terms are also appropriate to model the surface - induced anisotropy of a single magnetic atom on a metallic substrate with a decoupling layer . @xcite to investigate how the interaction with the electrons affects the magnetic properties of the impurity , we carry out numerical renormalization group@xcite ( nrg ) calculations and focus on the magnetic field dependence of the impurity magnetization .    regarding the experimental situation , the magnetic moment of deposited molecules ( or atoms)@xcite can be measured using methods such as x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) .",
    "@xcite xmcd is an element - specific technique of high sensitivity based on the absorption of circularly polarized x - rays and can be used to obtain an ensemble - averaged result for the magnetic field dependent molecule magnetization . in principle , it is also possible to extract information about different contributions to the observed magnetic moment ( such as the orbital and spin contribution ) from the xmcd data using , e.g. , sum rules . @xcite in the last years , magnetization curves of magnetic atoms on non - magnetic metallic surfaces could also be recorded using spin - polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sp - sts ) .",
