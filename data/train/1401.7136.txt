    "a scalar massless field in de sitter spacetime has a scale invariant power spectrum .",
    "this is not the case for a field of mass @xmath7 in an inflationary background , where the hubble rate @xmath8 varies according to the slow roll relation @xmath9 .",
    "specifically , the perturbations of a scalar field @xmath10 with canonical kinetic term obey the equation @xmath11   \\left ( a\\ , \\delta \\sigma \\right ) = 0 \\;\\ ;    \\label{sig - can}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 + { \\rm o } \\left ( \\epsilon^2 \\right ) \\;\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\   \\label{m - eff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leading to a spectral tilt @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , in generic curvaton models , the fact that the observed cosmological perturbations are nearly scale invariant indicates that the inflationary expansion was close to de sitter , @xmath14 , and that the field was light , @xmath15 .",
    "the effective mass of the perturbations varies because of the last term in the square parenthesis of ( [ m - eff ] ) , and because of the @xmath16 terms , giving rise to running of the spectral tilt .",
    "( [ m - eff ] ) shows that in generic curvaton models this variation is at most of @xmath17 , namely @xmath18    an analogous conclusion is reached in models of single field inflation . in this case , @xmath19 where we introduce the slow roll parameters @xmath20 ( we denote with a comma the derivative of a function with respect to its argument ) . in generic models ,",
    "the third slow roll parameter is small , and again the prediction ( [ as - ns ] ) is obtained  @xcite .",
    "some past observational results have been in slight tension with this estimate .",
    "for instance , the first wmap release gave  @xcite @xmath21 , and , more recently , the spt high-@xmath22 cmb data gave  @xcite @xmath23 ( spt + wmap7 ) and @xmath24 ( using also bao and @xmath25 measurements ) .",
    "although in agreement with the @xmath26 prediction , the planck result  ( [ ns - as - planck ] ) is not conclusive on this regard , since it is also statistically compatible with the spt measurement .",
    "therefore , if future measurements will again provide an indication for @xmath27 and statistically incompatible with zero , they will pose a serious challenge on standard inflationary models .",
    "see @xcite for a comprehensive analysis of how future large scale structure or 21 cm observations can lower current bounds on @xmath5 to the region @xmath28 , in absence of detection . in single field inflation , without the third derivative term @xmath29 , the observed spectral tilt @xmath30 is incompatible with @xmath31 .",
    "besides being hard to motivate , it is difficult to preserve a large third derivative , while keeping the first two small , for a sufficiently long duration of inflation  @xcite , so that the models that achieve a large running have potentials with some bump - like feature or superimposed oscillations @xcite , or possess some peculiar aspects beyond standard scenarios  @xcite .    in curvaton models ,",
    "the above estimate @xmath32 could be compatible with a running of first order in slow roll if @xmath7 was of order @xmath8 .",
    "however , as commented after eq .",
    "( [ m - eff ] ) , this would lead to an unacceptable value for @xmath33 . in this work",
    "we show that @xmath34 is possible if the curvaton lagrangian has a non - standard normalization .",
    "specifically , let us consider the case in which the curvaton has a time - dependent normalization that we encode in an overall function that multiplies the curvaton lagrangian : @xmath35 , and that a mass term @xmath36 is present limit .",
    "if we did so , we would conclude from eq .",
    "( [ sig - can ] ) that a field with @xmath37 and @xmath38 has the tachyonic mass @xmath39 on a ( quasi)-de sitter , non static , background . a field with @xmath37 and @xmath40 is typically denoted as massless , and our choice of denoting as mass term the second derivative of the potential in a static background is consistent with this .",
    "] in @xmath41 .",
    "this model can lead to a scale invariant spectrum for any value of @xmath7 ( hence even for @xmath42 ) , provided that @xmath43 has a suitable time evolution .",
    "once we canonically normalize the curvaton field , a new term , related to the rate of change of the normalization , @xmath44 , appears in the dispersion relation of the curvaton perturbations , and the total @xmath45 can be tuned to a sufficiently small value by canceling this new term against those appearing in ( [ m - eff ] ) . in the specific model that we will consider , @xmath46 , and",
    "this quantity varies at first order in slow roll . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass term @xmath7 in the curvaton lagrangian is a constant .",
    "therefore , the tuning that sets @xmath47 to the value required by @xmath48 can not work at all scales .",
    "this naturally introduces a running of the spectral tilt which is of the first order in slow roll , and which therefore can be much larger than the prediction ( [ as - ns ] ) .    rather than introducing an unspecified external function of time",
    ", we can assume that @xmath49 is actually a function of the inflaton , given that the latter acts as a clock during inflation .",
    "this introduces a direct coupling between the inflaton and the curvaton perturbations .",
    "we study the conditions for which the effect of such couplings is suppressed , so that only the inflaton zero mode dynamics affects the perturbations of the curvaton through the time evolution of @xmath49 .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", our system shows that fields with a very large mass term do not necessarily decouple during inflation , and can play an active and distinctive role for the generation of an almost scale invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations , if they are appropriately coupled to other degrees of freedom ( as those controlling the time dependent normalization @xmath49 in our example ) .",
    "this model also helps reformulating the naturalness problem in inflation . while it is usually assumed that a necessary condition for the generation of a scale - invariant power spectrum during inflation is the presence of a scalar field with a small mass term , in the present scenario it is possible to obtain scale invariance even for a curved potential by appropriately tuning the coupling of the inflaton to the curvaton .",
    "therefore the fine - tuning of the curvaton mass term to zero generalizes to a relation  given by eq .",
    "( [ alpha - cond ] ) below  involving the mass term of the curvaton and the coupling , measured by @xmath50 , to the inflaton .",
    "note that this implies that we are _ not _ solving the so - called @xmath51-problem , as we are not aware of any symmetry that can enforce the relation  ( [ alpha - cond ] ) , but we are formulating it in a more general way .",
    "constructions of the form considered in this paper , where the lagrangian of the curvaton is multiplied by a function of the inflaton , appear quite naturally in models where the inflaton is the radial part and the curvaton is the angular part of a complex field .",
    "we show this with an explicit example , featuring a model of broken u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "moreover , by a suitable change of frame , we show that our mechanism can be re - expressed in terms of a scalar field with time dependent mass and sound speed , embedded in an appropriately chosen friedmann - robertson - walker background .",
    "various recent works have studied interesting scenarios in which massive fields play a role to characterize the features of primordial fluctuations produced during inflation .",
    "for example , in the gelaton scenario @xcite , a very massive scalar field is tightly coupled to the inflaton in such a way to reduce the inflaton effective sound speed and produce large non - gaussianities of equilateral form in the inflaton sector . in quasi - single field inflationary models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the interplay between the dynamics of inflaton and isocurvatons with hubble mass can again lead to large non - gaussian signatures in the inflaton fluctuations . in reference  @xcite it was shown that heavy fields can adjust their value as a response to the inflaton expectation value , effectively changing the shape of the inflaton potential .",
    "our point of view is different , since we focus on the dynamics of the fluctuations of the isocurvature scalar field and their properties . in our scenario ,",
    "the suitable time - dependent normalization renders the isocurvature field effectively massless during inflation ( although it would have a large mass in a static background ) .",
    "as common in curvaton scenarios , we make the hypothesis that inflaton fluctuations have negligible amplitude and do not take part to the final curvature perturbations : hence , we will not be interested on possible non - gaussian effects generated in the inflaton sector .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ps ] we show how a massive field @xmath10 with a mass term @xmath52 can obtain an almost scale invariant power spectrum if its normalization @xmath43 exhibits a suitable time evolution . in section [ sec : replace ] we present a simple model in which @xmath43 is obtained through a coupling between @xmath10 and the inflaton field @xmath53 .",
    "this concrete model allow us to set some bounds on the mechanism , by requiring that the coupling _",
    "( i ) _ does not significantly affect the background inflaton evolution , _ ( ii ) _ does not modify the power spectrum of the primordial perturbations besides the effect related to @xmath43 , and _ ( iii ) _ does not result in a too large non - gaussianity .",
    "in section [ sec : run ] we compute the running of the spectral tilt from this mechanism , showing that it can acquire a size much larger than in standard inflationary set - ups . in section  [ sec : realization ] we present the example of a possible realization of this mechanism in an inflationary set - up , and in section  [ sub : frame ] we discuss how our system is equivalent to that of a field in a universe with an arbitrary expansion law , provided it has an appropriate time evolution of its mass and its speed of sound . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a real scalar field @xmath10 with a mass term @xmath34 , where @xmath8 is the hubble rate during inflation   is smaller than the hubble rate @xmath8 during inflation .",
    "however , taking @xmath54 reproduces the standard case of a light field with very nearly constant normalization , and therefore we target the discussion to the @xmath34 case . ] . for the sake of explaining our arguments in the simplest possible terms , we take @xmath8 as constant in the computations of this section , assuming that the slow roll parameter @xmath55 is negligible .",
    "the impact of a sizable @xmath56 on this mechanism will be studied in section [ sec : run ] .",
    "the action for @xmath10 is @xmath57 where the only difference from a theory of a free massive field is in the assumption that the lagrangian of @xmath10 is multiplied by a time - dependent function @xmath49 .",
    "first of all , we show that a suitable time dependence of @xmath49 results in a scale invariant spectrum for the perturbations of @xmath10 .",
    "specifically , we assume that @xmath49 scales as a power law of the scale factor @xmath58 for at least the last @xmath59 e - folds of inflation : @xmath60 ( with constant @xmath50 ) where the scale factor has been normalized such that @xmath61 at the end of inflation .",
    "it is natural to try to ascribe the time dependence of ( [ n - t ] ) to the evolution of the inflaton , and we will do so in section  [ sec : replace ] . for the computations of this section we can simply consider @xmath49 as an external function of time .",
    "we use conformal time @xmath62 , defined from the line element @xmath63 $ ] , and we decompose @xmath64 during inflation , the fourier transform of the perturbations of @xmath65 obeys the equation   in real space , we denote by @xmath66 its fourier transform , and by @xmath67 the mode functions of the fourier transform , see also eqs .",

    "see section  [ sec : run ] for the extension of this computation at first order in slow roll .",
    "the field @xmath65 is canonically normalized in ( [ action1 ] ) : imposing that the mode field @xmath10 is in the adiabatic vacuum during the sub - horizon regime results in the early time solution @xmath70 .",
    "it is then straightforward to see that the perturbations of @xmath10 are scale - invariant in the super - horizon regime provided that @xmath71 namely , a scale invariant spectrum can be obtained for an arbitrarily large mass , provided that the normalization @xmath49 varies sufficiently fast ; we find two branches of solutions , labeled with @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ alpha - cond ] ) . in a sense ,",
    "an appropriate choice of @xmath49 renders the field effectively massless . when eq .",
    "( [ alpha - cond ] ) holds , during inflation the mode functions of @xmath73 have the same solution as those of a massless scalar field with constant normalization @xmath74    if the field @xmath10 is responsible for the cosmological perturbations , its power can not be precisely scale invariant , but it needs to agree with ( [ ns - as - planck ] ) .",
    "the condition ( [ alpha - cond ] ) needs therefore to be replaced by @xmath75 as we will discuss in section [ sec : run ] , it is straightforward to extend this relation to the case of a slowly varying @xmath8 , following the standard computations done for @xmath76 ( see for instance @xcite ) . we will learn that this leads to an interesting footprint for our scenario , namely a large running of the spectral tilt .    equation ( [ alpha - ns ] ) shows the change in the spectral tilt resulting from a change in @xmath50 , and therefore indicates the width of the allowed interval for @xmath50 compatible with the experimentally allowed range @xmath77 . for large field mass",
    "we obtain @xmath78 this equation quantifies the fine - tuning in the mechanism , namely the accuracy to which @xmath50 needs to be set to a given value to be compatible with data at a given scale .",
    "we see that the degree of fine tuning increases as @xmath7 increases . the problem of preserving this tuning against radiative corrections is the manifestation in our mechanism of the so called @xmath51 problem of inflationary cosmology .    in the remainder of this section , to keep the algebra simple , we restrict our discussion to the scale invariant case ( [ alpha - cond ] ) , but all our results can be straightforwardly extended to the case ( [ alpha - ns ] ) .    during inflation , the background field @xmath79 obeys an equation identical to ( [ eom - dc ] ) with @xmath80 .",
    "this results into @xmath81 where @xmath82 in an integration constant , and where we have disregarded the rapidly decaying solution @xmath83 . for definiteness , we assume @xmath84 . in principle , the value for @xmath82 could be determined only with the knowledge of the history of the universe before the final @xmath85 e - folds of inflation .",
    "we do not commit ourselves to any specific scenario for this previous stage , but we rather study under which conditions on @xmath82 our mechanism can work .    the energy density associated with ( [ chi-0 ] ) is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the energy - momentum tensor associated with ( [ action1 ] ) .",
    "namely , the specific evolution of @xmath49 that provides a scale invariant spectrum of @xmath73 also results in a constant background energy density for @xmath65 . by keeping @xmath82 sufficiently small , we can impose that @xmath88 , so that this energy density is negligible during inflation .",
    "we have also to make sure that the energy in the perturbations does not exceed the energy in the background . to do so , we expand @xmath89 to second order , dubbing the result as @xmath90 , and we quantize @xmath73 according to @xmath91 where the mode functions in the last expression are given by ( [ dc - sol ] ) , and where the operators satisfy the algebra @xmath92 = \\delta^{(3 ) } \\left ( \\vec{k } - \\vec{p } \\right)$ ] .",
    "we then obtain the theoretical expectation value @xmath93 the theoretical expectation value for the energy density is obtained by integrating this quantity over the modes that have left the horizon during inflation and have become classical .",

    "this quantity is typically much smaller than the inflaton energy density @xmath97 .",
    "the observable we eventually care about is the curvature perturbation after inflation , under the assumption that @xmath10 is the curvaton field responsible for it .",
    "it is conventional to compute the quantity @xmath98 , which represents the curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces @xmath98 . in spatially flat gauge ( @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the metric ) , each species @xmath101 induces the curvature perturbation @xmath102 .",
    "the total curvature perturbation after inflation is then given by @xmath103 where ` rad ' denotes the contribution from the thermal bath formed when the inflaton decays , which we are assuming to take place well before the decay of the curvaton @xmath10 .",
    "( [ zeta - tot ] ) is actually valid after the decay of the inflaton and before that of @xmath10 .",
    "the ratio @xmath104 is typically very small at the end of inflation , but it then becomes of order one provided the field @xmath10 is sufficiently long - lived .",
    "the perturbations in @xmath10 are given by @xmath105 where the suffix @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) indicates that the quantity is evaluated on super - horizon scales during ( after ) inflation .",
    "we note that the ratio is constant both during and after inflation .",
    "after inflation , @xmath10 is a standard massive scalar field , and both @xmath108 .   during inflation instead both these quantities are constant .",
    "the final equality in ( [ zeta - phi ] ) is due to the fact that the detailed physics responsible for the transition in @xmath49 does not affect the perturbation at super - horizon scales .",
    "it is therefore convenient to evaluate @xmath109 on super - horizon scales during inflation .    given that the energy of a massive field is @xmath110 , the @xmath111 contribution to the energy density induces a non - gaussianity in @xmath98 , even if @xmath112 is by itself a gaussian field .",

    "<S> in slow roll inflation , the running of the spectral tilt is generically proportional to the square of the deviation from scale invariance , @xmath0 , and it is therefore currently undetectable . </S>",

    "<S> the mechanism is based on a curvaton field with a large mass term , and a time evolving normalization . </S>",

    "<S> , the curvaton can be made effectively light at the cmb scales , giving a spectral tilt in agreement with observations . </S>",
    "<S> the lightness is not preserved at later times , resulting in a detectable running of the spectral tilt . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism shows that fields with a large mass term do not necessarily decouple from the inflationary physics , and provides a new tool for model building in inflation .    -2 </S>"
