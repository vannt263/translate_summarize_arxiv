    "therefore , we can conclude that the increase of the cross correlation length seen in the figure  [ m - r0 ] is not only due to the bias related with the galaxy brightness .",
    "the estimated scale length is larger than figure  [ m - r0 ] since blighter galaxies are more strongly clustered .",

    "it has also been shown that radio selected agns are strongly clustered than the cases for the optically selected agns @xcite , and characteristic bh mass of radio agns is higher than optically selected ones .",

    "these may indicate that the environment of galaxies has played an important role for the growth of high mass smbhs .",
    "the clustering amplitude is relevant to the mass of the host dark - matter halo and the frequency of major merger .",

    "bh mass has been thought to be correlated with the mass of dark matter halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently , however , @xcite found that the mass of smbh does not directly correlate with dark matter halo mass , at least for low - mass smbhs in disk galaxies , based on the observations of nearby smbhs for which mass of the host dark halos are derived by the stellar kinematics .",
    "one possible scenario to explain the absence of the positive mass dependence for @xmath178 would be that the less massive bhs could be formed in the isolated galaxies by secular processes .",
    "if they have grown by secular processes , mass of a seed bh should be much larger than a typical stellar mass bh ( for a review , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some authors @xcite argue that smbhs with @xmath179@xmath180 are formed through the direct collapse of pre - galactic gas at @xmath18110 .",
    "such a heavy seed bh can grow to @xmath182@xmath183 by a few gyrs without bh merger under the assumption that the mass accretion rate is around @xmath184 times the eddington rate",
    ". another scenario would be that they are in a growing phase by the major mergers of galaxies .",
    "for the clustering amplitude of less massive smbhs , the contribution of the agns hosted in satellite galaxies in the massive dark - matter halos can also be important , while most massive smbhs are in the central regions of dark - matter halos .",
    "@xcite argue that the satellite fraction of quasars is more than @xmath185 in their sample , which is selected from the sdss catalog .",
    "the percentage should be larger for the less massive bhs .",

    "our results are free from the effect of cosmic variance owing to the large sample covering the large area of the sky .",
    "the estimated correlation length ranges between @xmath187@xmath188 depending on bh mass , and depends neither on redshift for @xmath148@xmath186 nor on luminosity .",
    "the results may indicate that higher mass bhs reside in more clustered environment for @xmath5 .    while our results show positive mass dependence for @xmath5 , our results for @xmath178 show no significant mass dependence .",
    "although our sample of less massive bhs is small , this would give a critical mass scale for emergence of environment effect for bh growth .",
    "in this study the redshift range where the bh mass dependence of the cross correlation is measured with good accuracy is limited to below @xmath189 .",
    "this is because the number density of ukidss las galaxies is too low at higher redshift , and also the systematic error due to the uncertainty of @xmath14 parameter of luminosity function is too large . to understand the relation of the bh mass accretion history and it environment , it is crucial to observe its evolution upto at least redshift two where the number density of qso is maximal and the mass accretion is expected to be the most prosperous . to reduce the uncertainty ,",
    "it is crucial to perform deeper observations so that the limiting magnitude reaches well beyond the characteristic luminosity of galaxies at agn redshifts . at redshifts larger than 0.5 , the dominant factor to the uncertainty of @xmath37 is uncertainty of @xmath66 parameterization and the @xmath37 uncertainty becomes larger than 20% .",
    "two magnitude deeper observation will extend the redshift ranage where the uncertainty of @xmath37 is less than 20% up to 1.0 .",
    "future instruments such as hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) can measure the agn environment more accurately with good statistics . when the survey is performed with 26 mag in @xmath55 band with hsc",
    ", we can estimate @xmath37 with accuracy less than 20% up to redshift 2 , and as a result can estimate @xmath112 with accurary less than 10% . such a deep and wide survey would reveal the mechanism of agn evolution at an important epoch that its activity was the most prosperous .",
