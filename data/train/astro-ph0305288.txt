    "the structure of the pulsar magnetosphere has been an active area of research for more that 30 years , starting with the pioneering work by goldreich & julian ( 1969 ) . despite the fact that real astrophysical radio - pulsars are believed to be oblique rotating magnetic dipoles ,",
    "much of the theoretical effort has been devoted to a significantly simpler case of an aligned rotating magnetic dipole ( i.e. , a `` non - pulsing pulsar '' ) , in which case the problem becomes stationary and axisymmetric .",
    "the situation becomes even more tractable if one also assumes the space around the pulsar to be filled with a plasma that , on one hand , is dense enough to shorten out the longitudinal electric fields , thus providing the basis for the ideal - magnetohydrodynamic approximation , and , on the other hand , is at the same time tenuous enough for all the non - electromagnetic forces to be negligible , thus enabling one to regard the plasma as force - free .",
    "all these simplifications have lead early on to the derivation , simultaneously by several researchers , of the main equation governing the structure of the magnetosphere , the so - called pulsar equation ( scharlemann & wagoner  1973 ; michel  1973b ; okamoto  1974 ) , which is essentially a special - relativistic generalization of the well - known force - free grad ",
    "shafranov equation .",
    "this equation is a quasi - linear elliptic second - order partial differential equation with a regular singular surface , the so - called light cylinder . despite the fact that this , in general non - linear , equation was first derived thirty years ago ,",
    "most of the attempts to solve it , both analytical and numerical , have been limited , until very recently , to its linear special cases and to the region inside the light cylinder ( e.g. , scharlemann & wagoner  1973 ; michel  1973a ; beskin et al .  1983 ; beskin & malyshkin  1998 ) .",
    "these self - imposed restrictions can of course be attributed to the considerations of mathematical convenience and tractability ; however , they are not very well physically motivated and thus may be too restrictive to be relevant to real astrophysical systems .    at the same time , by the late 1990s , the available computing resources and numerical techniques have become sufficiently powerful for the most general nonlinear problem , involving the regions on both sides of the light cylinder , to become tractable . in their pioneering work , contopoulos  et  al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter ckf ) have obtained the first ( and apparently unique ) numerical solution of the general problem , albeit with a rather poor spatial resolution .",
    "their approach has later been used by ogura & kojima ( 2003 ) who have obtained essentially the same results , but with a higher numerical resolution .",
    "both of these groups have focussed on the global structure of the solution ; consequently , they have not paid enough attention , in our opinion , to some key but subtle issues regarding the separatrix between the open and closed field - line regions and , especially , the point of intersection of this separatrix with the equatorial plane . as a result ,",
    "the separatrix has not , we believe , been treated correctly , and , in particular , the separatrix equilibrium condition ( okamoto  1974 ; lyubarskii  1990 ) has not been satisfied close to the intersection point .",
    "we thus suspect that their solution is probably not quite correct .    in this paper",
    "we try to clarify how the magnetic field near the separatrix and especially around the separatrix  equator intersection point should be treated , as this question appears to be extremely important for setting up the _ correct _ boundary conditions for the global problem .    in ",
    "[ sec - basic ] we review the basic equations describing the ideal - mhd force - free magnetosphere of an aligned rotating dipole ; we pay special attention to the so - called light cylinder regularity condition and discuss how this condition could be used to find the correct form of the poloidal - current function and , simultaneously , to obtain the solution that passes smoothly across the light cylinder .",
    "then , in   [ sec - y - point ] , we investigate some general properties of the magnetic field near the putative separatrix between the open and closed field regions ; we use the separatrix equilibrium condition to show that , if the separatrix intersects the equator at the light cylinder ( as has been assumed in the numerical simulations by ckf and by ogura & kojima  2003 ) , then the poloidal current and hence the toroidal magnetic field have to vanish on the last open field line above the separatrix .",
    "we then use these findings in   [ sec - analysis ] to construct a unique self - similar asymptotic solution of the pulsar equation in the vicinity of such an intersection point ; in particular , we find all the power - law exponents describing the field near this point and also the angle between the separatrix and the equator . at the end of this section",
    "we show that a light surface ( a surface where the electric field becomes equal to the magnetic field and therefore where the particle drift velocity reaches the speed of light ) has to appear right outside the light cylinder ( it starts at the intersection point and extends outward at a finite angle with respect to the equator ) . we thus conclude that the only way to get a force - free solution that would be valid at least some finite distance beyond the light cylinder , is to consider the case of a separatrix  equator intersection point lying some finite distance inside the light cylinder .",
    "we investigate the magnetic field structure around such a point in   [ sec - t - point ] .",
    "we find that in this case the poloidal - current function may stay finite , but its derivative with respect to the poloidal flux has to go to zero on the last open field line ; we then find the asymptotic behavior of the magnetic field around the intersection point corresponding to this case .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in   [ sec - conclusions ] , where we also discuss the implications of our results for the past and future numerical studies of the axisymmetric pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "we consider the magnetosphere of an aligned rotating magnetic dipole under the assumptions of stationarity , axial symmetry with respect to the rotation axis  @xmath0 , and reflection symmetry with respect to the equator @xmath1 .",
    "we shall include the effects of special relativity but will ignore general - relativistic effects ( i.e. , work in euclidean space ) .",
    "we shall assume that the dipole is surrounded by a very tenuous , but highly conducting plasma .",
    "the first of these assumptions enables us to neglect all non - electromagnetic forces ( i.e. , gravity , inertial , and pressure forces ) , and thus to conclude that the structure of the magnetosphere is governed by the relativistic force - free equation : @xmath2 here , the electric charge density @xmath3 and the electric current density @xmath4 are related to the electric and magnetic field through the steady - state maxwell equations : @xmath5    the second of our assumptions concerning the magnetospheric plasma , i.e. , the assumption of infinite conductivity , enables us to use ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) : @xmath6    these equations ( with the appropriate boundary conditions ) should be sufficient for determining the structure of the magnetosphere .",
    "as is well known , an axisymmetric magnetic field @xmath7 can be described in terms of two functions , the poloidal magnetic flux ( per one radian in the azimuthal direction ) @xmath8 and the poloidal current  @xmath9 , as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the azimuthal ( or toroidal ) angle . in cylindrical coordinates",
    "the magnetic field components then are : @xmath13    next , by applying faraday s law @xmath14 in a steady state , we see that @xmath15 , and hence @xmath16 ; together with the assumption of axial symmetry , this gives @xmath17 that is , the electric field is purely poloidal .",
    "since , as it follows from equation  ( [ eq - force - free ] ) or  ( [ eq - ideal - mhd ] ) , the electric field must be perpendicular to the magnetic field , we can write it as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the poloidal magnetic field , and @xmath20 is the unit vector in the @xmath11-direction . by substituting this relationship into @xmath15 , we find that  @xmath21 , which has the meaning of the angular velocity of magnetic field lines , is constant along the field lines , @xmath22 .",
    "this is the well - known ferraro isorotation law .    in the problem",
    "we are interested in , all the field lines are tied , at least at one end , to the surface of the pulsar , which is assumed to be rotating as a solid body with some uniform angular velocity  @xmath23 .",
    "we also assume that our ideal - mhd assumption is valid all the way up to the pulsar surface , i.e. , that there is no appreciable gap between this surface and the ideal - mhd region .",
    "therefore , from now on , we shall assume that all the field lines rotate with the same angular velocity was considered , e.g. , by beskin  et  al .",
    "( 1983 ) and by beskin & malyshkin ( 1998 ) . ]",
    "@xmath24    from equation  ( [ eq - e ] ) we find @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cylindrical radius normalized to the radius of the light cylinder ( lc ) @xmath27 .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath28 inside the lc and @xmath29 outside the  lc",
    ".    now let us turn to the force - free equation  ( [ eq - force - free ] ) .",
    "the toroidal component of this equation , together with equation  ( [ eq - e_phi=0 ] ) , gives : @xmath30 \\times [ \\nabla\\psi\\times\\nabla\\phi ] = 0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\tilde{i}=\\tilde{i}(\\psi ) \\",
    ", , \\label{eq - i = i(psi)}\\ ] ] and the poloidal component ( perpendicular to  @xmath31 ) of equation  ( [ eq - force - free ] ) can be written as @xmath32 - { { 1+x^2}\\over x}\\ , { \\partial\\psi\\over{\\partial x } } = - i i'(\\psi ) \\ , , \\label{eq - pulsar}\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath33 and where we also incorporated @xmath34 into @xmath35 on the right - hand side ( rhs ) by defining @xmath36    then the magnetic field components can be rewritten in terms of  @xmath37 as @xmath38    equation ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) is the famous _ pulsar equation _ ( scharlemann & wagoner  1973 ; michel  1973b ; okamoto  1974 ) , also known in literature as the relativistic force - free grad  shafranov equation ( e.g. , beskin  1997 ) .",
    "it is an elliptic second - order partial differential equation ( pde ) for the flux function  @xmath37 ; the left - hand side ( lhs ) of this equation is linear , whereas the rhs is , in general , nonlinear .",
    "one very important feature of equation  ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) is that it has a regular singular surface at the light cylinder  @xmath39 .",
    "both indicial ( or characteristic ) exponents for this equation are equal to zero and so a general solution of equation  ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) diverges logarithmically at this surface ( e.g. , bender & orszag  1978 ) . on physical grounds ,",
    "one imposes an additional condition that both the function  @xmath37 and its 1st and 2nd derivatives remain finite near the  lc . for any given function @xmath35",
    ", it is indeed possible to find such non - divergent solutions separately on each side of the  lc .",
    "then , as can be seen from equation  ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) itself , the contribution of the first term on the lhs [ the term proportional to @xmath40 vanishes as @xmath41 , and thus such non - divergent solutions on both sides of the  lc have to satisfy the well - known lc regularity condition ( e.g. , scharlemann & wagoner  1973 ; okamoto  1974 ; beskin  1997 ) : @xmath42    this condition is very important and merits a few extra words of discussion . our force - free equation with a constant field - line angular velocity  @xmath21 is a 2nd - order equation with one , a priori unknown , integral of motion , @xmath35 , and one singular surface , the  lc . according to general theory ( beskin  1997 ) , one then needs two boundary conditions to set up the problem properly .",
    "we believe that the correct approach here is to set the boundary conditions for the function  @xmath8 at both the inner boundary ( inside the  lc : on the surface of the star , the symmetry axis , the separatrix between the open and closed field - line regions , and maybe the equator ) and at whatever outer boundary ( outside the  lc : the equator and infinity or the light surface ) . at the same time the poloidal current function  @xmath35 should not be prescribed explicitly at any boundary of the domain ; instead , it is to be determined from the matching condition at the singular surface , i.e. , the  lc ( see below ) .",
    "thus , our position differs from that of beskin ( see beskin et al .  1983 , and beskin  1997 ) who proposed prescribing  @xmath35 explicitly at the surface of the pulsar . indeed , if one considers the region inside the lc only , then , upon prescribing both  @xmath8 and  @xmath35 on the inner boundary ( the pulsar surface , etc . ) , one should be able to obtain a solution that is regular at the  lc by using the regularity condition  ( [ eq - regularity - lc ] ) at the other boundary of this inner region , i.e. , at the  lc .",
    "thus , the solution in this inner region is then completely determined ; as such , it is totally independent of what happens outside the  lc .",
    "this does not seem physical ; indeed , one should then be able to take this solution and continue it smoothly across the  lc , thus prescribing both @xmath43 and @xmath44 at the outer side of the  lc .",
    "but then the problem of finding a solution in the region outside the lc becomes over - determined , as we now have two conditions at @xmath39 , in addition to any conditions at the outer boundary .",
    "for example , in the very important particular case of the domain under consideration extending all the way to radial infinity , one can not actually prescribe any specific boundary conditions at infinity because equation  ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) has a regular singularity there .",
    "instead , however , one imposes a regularity condition at infinity . in spherical polar coordinates ) .",
    "we hope that this does not cause any confusion . ] ( @xmath45 ) this regularity condition can be written as @xmath46 this regularity condition has a very simple physical meaning : it is the condition of the force balance in the @xmath47-direction between the toroidal magnetic field  @xmath48 and the poloidal electric field  @xmath49 ( which both become much larger than the poloidal magnetic field @xmath50 as one approaches infinity ) .",
    "thus , in this case the region outside the lc does not have any boundary conditions at all ( apart from the condition @xmath51 at the equator ) , but has two regularity conditions , one at the  lc , and the other at infinity .",
    "these two regularity conditions are already sufficient to uniquely determine the solution @xmath52 for a given  @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , if , in addition to these two regularity conditions , one also tries to impose the function @xmath43 along the  lc , the system becomes over - determined .",
    "thus we come to the conclusion that prescribing @xmath35 at the inner boundary is not appropriate .",
    "one could , however , try to use the outer boundary condition ( or the regularity condition at infinity ) as the condition that fixes  @xmath35 . to do this",
    ", one first sets the inner boundary conditions , picks an initial guess for  @xmath35 , and uses  ( [ eq - regularity - lc ] ) to obtain a regular solution inside the  lc ; one then continues this solution smoothly across the  lc and solves equation  ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) in the outer region as an initial - value problem ( with both  @xmath8 and @xmath53 specified at  @xmath39 ) ; as a result , one gets a mismatch at the outer boundary between the obtained solution and the desired outer boundary condition [ or , in the case of an infinite domain , one would presumably fail to get a convergent solution satisfying the regularity condition  ( [ eq - regularity - infinity ] ) ] .",
    "then one iterates with respect to  @xmath35 until this outer - boundary mismatch is zero ( or until a solution regular at infinity is achieved ) . in reality , however , such an approach may not be practical as it involves solving an initial - value problem for an elliptic equation , which is not a well - posed problem .    instead , we advocate the approach adopted by ckf . in this approach",
    "one considers the regions inside the  lc ( @xmath54 ) and outside the  lc ( @xmath55 ) separately .",
    "first , one makes an initial guess for  @xmath35 and prescribes the corresponding boundary conditions for  @xmath8 at the inner boundary of the the region inside the  lc and at the outer boundary of the the region outside the  lc [ or , if this outer boundary is at the radial infinity , imposes the regularity condition  ( [ eq - regularity - infinity ] ) there ] .",
    "then , one uses , again separately in each region , the regularity condition  ( [ eq - regularity - lc ] ) in lieu of a boundary condition at the  lc [ in practice , one can think of  ( [ eq - regularity - lc ] ) as of a mixed - type dirichlet ",
    "von  neumann boundary condition relating the value of  @xmath8 at the surface  @xmath39 to the value of its derivative normal to this surface ] .",
    "thus one obtains two solutions , one inside and the other outside the  lc , that correspond to the same function  @xmath35 and are both regular at  @xmath39 .",
    "however , these solutions also depend on their respective boundary or regularity conditions set at the inner / outer boundaries of the domain .",
    "hence , in general , although they are both regular at the  lc , these solutions are not going to coincide at  @xmath39 .",
    "the mismatch @xmath56 depends on both the chosen function @xmath35 and on the inner and outer boundary conditions .",
    "one then iterates with respect to  @xmath35 in order to minimize this mismatch .",
    "we believe that for a given set of boundary conditions there should be only one choice of  @xmath35 for which the mismatch @xmath57 vanishes and hence the function  @xmath8 becomes continuous along the entire  lc , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "once this special function  @xmath35 is found , it then follows from  ( [ eq - regularity - lc ] ) , which is satisfied separately on both sides of the  lc , that @xmath53 is also continuous , and so the entire solution passes smoothly across the  lc .",
    "thus , one can say that the function @xmath35 is determined by the regularity condition  ( [ eq - regularity - lc ] ) applied separately on both sides of the  lc , plus the condition of matching of the two solutions .",
    "another , equivalent way to put it , is to say that @xmath35 is determined by the ( non - trivial ! ) requirement that the derivative @xmath59 actually _ exists _ at the  lc [ whereby @xmath35 is expressed in terms of this derivative via equation  ( [ eq - regularity - lc ] ) ] .",
    "this approach has been implemented successfully in the pioneering numerical work by ckf and then subsequently by ogura & kojima ( 2003 ) .",
    "both these groups have used a relaxation procedure to arrive at @xmath35 that corresponded to a unique solution that was both continuous and smooth at the  lc .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the behavior of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the point of intersection of the separatrix @xmath60 between the region of closed field lines ( region  i ) and the region of open field lines ( region  ii ) with the equator @xmath61 ( see fig .  [ fig - geometry ] ) .",
    "we shall generally call this point the _ separatrix intersection point_. our interest in this non - trivial problem is fueled by the belief that understanding the key features of this behavior is absolutely crucial to devising the proper boundary conditions and providing verification benchmarks for any future global numerical investigations of a force - free pulsar magnetosphere . at the same time , the treatment of the magnetic field around this very special point is expected to require a certain degree of subtlety and delicacy , as noted , for example , by beskin et  al .",
    "( 1983 ) and by ogura & kojima  ( 2003 ) .",
    "among the questions that need to be answered are : what is the radial position @xmath62 of the intersection point ( namely , whether this point lies at the  lc , @xmath63 , of inside the  lc , @xmath64 ) ? and what is the angle @xmath65 at which the separatrix approaches the equator at this point , the three a priori possibilities being @xmath66 ( in which case we ll call this point the cusp - point ) , @xmath67 ( the y - point ) , and @xmath68 ( the t - point ) ?    in our analysis , we shall assume that equations  ( [ eq - force - free ] ) and  ( [ eq - ideal - mhd ] ) that describe our system are valid almost everywhere in the vicinity of the separatrix intersection point , i.e. , everywhere with perhaps the exception of measure - zero regions . thus , we shall allow for the presence in our system of current sheets of infinitesimal thickness , across which the magnetic field can experience a finite jump .",
    "we limit our consideration to the situation where such current sheets can be present only along the separatrix between regions  i and  ii for @xmath69 and along the equatorial ( @xmath61 ) separatrix between the upper and lower open - field regions for @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we have one current sheet that lies on the equator at @xmath70 and at @xmath71 splits into two symmetrical current sheets ( one in each hemisphere ) lying along the separatrix @xmath72 ( see , e.g. , okamoto  1974 ) .",
    "at the same time we assume that our equations apply everywhere else at least in some region around the intersection point , including the portion of this region that lies outside the lc ( in the case @xmath63 ) .",
    "let us first assume that the separatrix between closed and open field - line regions reaches the  lc ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) , and let us consider the separatrix equilibrium condition ( e.g. , okamoto 1974 ; lyubarskii  1990 ) .",
    "indeed , whether or not the separatrix contains a current sheet ( which we assume to be infinitesimally thin ) , it must satisfy the condition of force balance , which is obtained by integrating equation  ( [ eq - force - free ] ) across the separatrix : ) may not be valid inside a current sheet as other forces may also be important in the pressure balance there . however , gravity and the plasma inertia are small because the separatrix current layer is assumed to be very thin ; and the plasma pressure gradient , while not necessarily small inside the current layer , gives , when integrated across the layer , just the difference between the values of the pressure on both sides outside the separatrix , both of which are small by assumption . ] @xmath73    by using equation  ( [ eq-|e| ] ) and also the fact that @xmath74 in region  i , we can rewrite this condition as @xmath75\\ , ( 1-x^2 ) = ( b_\\phi^{ii})^2 = { 1\\over{r_{lc}^4}}\\ , { i^2(\\psi_s)\\over{x^2 } } \\ , , \\label{eq - sepx - equil-2}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 marks the distance from the intersection point ( @xmath61 ) along the separatrix .    now ,",
    "as the separatrix approaches the lc ( @xmath41 , @xmath77 ) , we get @xmath78 =   { { i_s^2}\\over{r_{lc}^4 } } \\ , , \\label{eq - sepx - equil - endpt}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath79 as the value of the poloidal current of the last open field line  @xmath80 ( above the separatrix current sheet ) .",
    "since @xmath81 is constant along this last open field line , and hence is independent of  @xmath76 , we immediately see that in order to satisfy equation  ( [ eq - sepx - equil - endpt ] ) in the limit @xmath41 , we must have either : + _ ( i ) _",
    "@xmath82 , i.e. , all poloidal current that flows out of the pulsar must return back to the pulsar along open magnetic field lines , with no finite poloidal current flowing along the separatrix ; of the compatibility condition by beskin  et  al .",
    "( 1983 ) and beskin & malyshkin ( 1998 ) . ] simultaneously , from equation  ( [ eq - sepx - equil - endpt ] ) it then follows that @xmath83 , and hence no finite toroidal current flows along the separatrix either ( we make a very natural assumption that @xmath84 is in the same direction as @xmath85 ) ; thus the separatrix in this case is actually not a current sheet ; + or , + _ ( ii ) _ a finite @xmath86 but a divergent poloidal magnetic field in the closed - field region , @xmath87 , as @xmath77 , @xmath88 . note that this situation can not be dismissed automatically ; indeed , close to the lc the magnitude of the electric field becomes very close to that of the poloidal magnetic field , with the infinitely strong electric forces balancing out the infinitely strong magnetic ones to a high degree .",
    "then , the separatrix current sheet would have to carry back to the star a finite poloidal current  @xmath81 ( thus closing the poloidal current circuit ) , and also a toroidal corotation current with the surface current density @xmath89 divergent near the lc : @xmath90 ; there would also have to be a divergent surface charge density on the separatrix : @xmath91 .",
    "note that these conclusions , derived from the separatrix equilibrium condition near the  lc , are valid regardless of the angle  @xmath65 between the separatrix and the equator at the intersection point .",
    "in our analysis in the next section we shall assume that there are no infinitely strong fields anywhere in the system , and thus shall dismiss situation _",
    "( ii ) _ ( @xmath63 , @xmath92 , finite @xmath86 ) as unphysical . we shall thus concentrate our attention on situation _ ( i ) _ ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "we shall try to analyze the structure of the pulsar equation  ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) and obtain the asymptotic solution of this equation in the vicinity of the intersection point ( @xmath63 , @xmath93 ) .",
    "in this section we perform an asymptotic analysis of the pulsar equation  ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) in the vicinity of the separatrix intersection point under the assumption that it is located at the  lc , i.e. , @xmath63 , @xmath93 .",
    "our approach is actually very similar to the analysis of the magnetic field near the endpoint of a non - relativistic reconnecting current layer , performed previously by uzdensky & kulsrud ( 1997 ) .",
    "in addition to assuming @xmath63 , we shall , in this section , make use of the following two assumptions : + 1 ) the intersection point is a finite - angle y - point , i.e. , the separatrix approaches the equator at an angle  @xmath65 , @xmath67 , where we measure angles from the radial vector lying on the equator and directed _ toward _ the star , as shown in figure  [ fig - geometry ] ; + 2 ) the poloidal current is fully closed in the open - field region , i.e. , @xmath94 ; this assumption is motivated by the arguments presented in the previous section .",
    "furthermore , we also assume symmetry with respect to the equator and therefore consider only the upper half - space , @xmath95 .    when considering the @xmath96-dependent coefficients in equation  ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) in the vicinity of the y - point , we can , to lowest order in @xmath97 , replace @xmath96 by  1 everywhere except where it appears in a combination like @xmath98 ; thus we can rewrite this equation as @xmath99 + 2 \\ , { { \\partial\\psi}\\over{\\partial\\xi } }   = - ii'(\\psi ) \\",
    ", , \\label{eq - pulsar - endpt}\\ ] ] where we introduced a new coordinate , @xmath100 . instead of using coordinates @xmath101 , it is actually more convenient to use polar coordinates @xmath102 defined by @xmath103    when making the transition to these coordinates , we shall make use of the following expressions : @xmath104 as well as the usual expression for two - dimensional ( 2-d ) laplacian in polar coordinates : @xmath105    in these coordinates the poloidal magnetic field components are written as follows ( we do not need these expressions now but will need them later ) : @xmath106    finally , by using expressions ( [ eq - coord - derivatives - xi])([eq-2d - laplacian ] ) , we can rewrite the pulsar equation  ( [ eq - pulsar - endpt ] ) in our polar coordinates ( [ eq - polar_coords-1])([eq - polar_coords-2 ] ) as @xmath107    now we need to solve this equation separately in region  i ( region of closed field lines , @xmath108 ) and in region  ii ( region of open field lines , @xmath109 ) and match the two solutions together at the separatrix @xmath110 . since in this paper we are dealing only with the local structure of the magnetic field near the y - point , we can , without any loss of generality , adopt the convention of counting the poloidal magnetic flux @xmath8 from the separatrix @xmath110 ( instead of the usual convention of counting  @xmath8 from the rotation axis ) .",
    "thus , we shall set @xmath111 and , correspondingly , @xmath112 in region  i and @xmath113 in region  ii .    very close to the y - point , i.e. at distances much smaller than the light cylinder radius ( @xmath114 )",
    ", the system lacks any natural length scale .",
    "hence , we can expect the radial dependence of  @xmath8 to be a power law , which enables us to make the following _ self - similar ansatz _ : @xmath115 [ we put a minus sign in equation  ( [ eq - psi_ii ] ) in order to have @xmath116 . ]",
    "then , the magnetic field components are given by : + in region  i : @xmath117 and in region  ii : @xmath118    notice that the condition that magnetic field does not diverge near @xmath119 imposes the restriction @xmath120 whereas for the case where the poloidal magnetic flux function in region  i diverges as @xmath121 [ i.e. , case _",

    "[ at this point , however , we have to remark that one can not a priori exclude the possibility @xmath141 ; in such a case the poloidal current would go to zero near the separatrix so rapidly that its contribution to the pulsar equation would become completely negligible .",

    "thus , we can rescale @xmath143 away by incorporating it into the solution ; we do this by defining a new variable @xmath144 then , equation  ( [ eq - pulsar - ii ] ) becomes @xmath145 with the same boundary conditions @xmath146    thus , we see that in our problem the magnetic field structure near the y - point is completely characterized by four finite dimensionless parameters : the separatrix angle  @xmath65 and the three power - law indices @xmath147 , @xmath133 , and  @xmath134 .",

    "then , using equations ( [ eq - br - i])([eq - btheta - ii ] ) , we immediately obtain a second relationship between the power exponents : @xmath152 and also a relationship between the normalizations of the functions @xmath131 and  @xmath132 , cast in terms of their derivatives at @xmath110 : @xmath153    the remaining two relationships between the dimensionless parameters come from the properties of equations  ( [ eq - pulsar - i ] ) and  ( [ eq - pulsar - ii - g ] ) themselves and can not , unfortunately , be written out as explicit algebraic equations containing these parameters .",
    "this fact , however , can prevent us neither from describing and discussing the physical and mathematical conditions on which these two additional relationships are based , nor from using these conditions to obtain the actual unique values of the parameters .",
    "first , we shall show that there is a unique one - to - one relationship between the separatrix angle @xmath65 and the power exponent  @xmath154 .",

    "the fourth ( and final ! ) condition that will help us determine  @xmath154 and hence  @xmath65 and the rest of the power exponents is the light cylinder regularity condition .",

    "first , we divide up region  ii into two sub - regions : region  ii@xmath183 ( inside the  lc : @xmath184 ) and region  ii@xmath185 ( outside the  lc : @xmath186 ) .",
    "then , we scan over  @xmath154 ; for each value of  @xmath154 , we first determine the corresponding value of  @xmath65 using the procedure outlined above .",
    "once @xmath65 for a given  @xmath154 is found , we solve equation  ( [ eq - pulsar - ii - g ] ) separately in regions  ii@xmath183 and  ii@xmath185 ( again , using a numerical shooting method in conjunction with the 2nd - order runge - kutta integration scheme ) . in each of these regions we use regularity condition  ( [ eq - lc - regularity - g ] ) at @xmath180 and one of the boundary conditions  ( [ eq - bc - ii - g ] ) at the other end of the region , i.e. , @xmath187 in region  ii@xmath183 and @xmath188 in region  ii@xmath185 .",
    "note that the use of the regularity condition  ( [ eq - lc - regularity - g ] ) guarantees that the solutions in _ each _ of the two regions are regular .",
    "however , in general ( i.e. , for an arbitrarily chosen  @xmath154 ) , the two solutions obtained in this manner do not match each other at the  lc , the mismatch @xmath189 [ and hence the mismatch in @xmath190 related to @xmath191 via eq .",
    "( [ eq - lc - regularity - g ] ) ] being @xmath154-dependent .",
    "we find that there is only one , special value of  @xmath154 for which @xmath191 vanishes and the solution continues smoothly across the  lc as one passes from region  ii@xmath183 into region  ii@xmath185 .",
    "this special value , which we call  @xmath192 , is declared the correct value of  @xmath154 .",
    "numerically , we find @xmath193 and , correspondingly , @xmath194 this is the way in which the unique correct solution of the problem is obtained .",
    "the functions @xmath131 and @xmath195 corresponding to this value of  @xmath154 are plotted in figures  [ fig - f_0 ] and  [ fig - g_0 ] , respectively .",
    "now let us make a little digression and step back to discuss the possibility of finding a solution in the case @xmath196 . recall that in this case the dominant balance of the lowest - order ( in  @xmath139 ) terms in the pulsar equation does not include the contribution @xmath197 due to the poloidal current .",
    "at the same time , note that relationships  ( [ eq - alpha1=alpha2 ] ) and  ( [ eq - sepx - f=-g ] ) , derived from the separatrix force - balance condition , still hold .",
    "hence , the solution in region  ii would have to satisfy a linear equation that is identical to equation  ( [ eq - pulsar - i ] ) for @xmath131 on the other side of the separatrix .",
    "this fact , combined with the condition  ( [ eq - sepx - f=-g ] ) , implies that the solution just has to pass smoothly across @xmath110 , and thus this point [ which is just an ordinary point for equation  ( [ eq - pulsar - i ] ) ] does not have any special significance ; it is just the point where the solution changes sign .",
    "thus , the general solution in this case takes the form @xmath198 , where @xmath131 satisfies the homogeneous linear equation  ( [ eq - pulsar - i ] ) in the entire domain @xmath199 $ ] with the homogeneous boundary conditions @xmath162 and @xmath200 .",
    "in addition , the solution has to pass smoothly across the regular singular point @xmath180 ( the light cylinder ) ; the regularity condition at this point is simply @xmath201 .",
    "such a solution would start positive with a zero derivative at @xmath161 , then decrease and change sign at some angle @xmath202 , reach a minimum at the  lc [ since @xmath201 ] , and finally increase and go back to zero at the equator @xmath204 .",
    "however , the extra regularity condition at @xmath180 makes the system over - determined . indeed ,",
    "counting two boundary conditions at @xmath205 , an arbitrary normalization of the solution [ e.g. , @xmath159 ] , and the lc regularity condition , we now have four conditions for our second - order equation with one free parameter  @xmath154 .",
    "thus , unless we are somehow extremely lucky , the solution of this problem does not exist .",
    "one can show that this is indeed the case ; it turns out that a solution of equation  ( [ eq - pulsar - i ] ) in the region inside the  lc ( @xmath207 $ ] ) satisfying both the boundary condition @xmath162 and the lc regularity condition @xmath201 exists only for even values of @xmath208 , whereas a solution in region ( @xmath209 $ ] ) satisfying both the boundary condition @xmath200 and the lc regularity condition exists only for odd values of @xmath210 .",
    "this demonstrates that , in the case @xmath196 , it is impossible to obtain a solution that is continuous at the  lc .",
    "this leaves us with the case @xmath211 ( for which we have just found a unique suitable solution ) as the only possibility .",
    "thus we have managed to obtain a _ unique _ asymptotic solution of the ideal - mhd , force - free system ( [ eq - force - free])([eq - ideal - mhd ] ) in the vicinity of the separatrix intersection point ( @xmath63 , @xmath93 ) .",
    "this solution , characterized by dimensionless parameters  ( [ eq - alpha_0 ] ) and  ( [ eq - beta&theta_0 ] ) , satisfies the separatrix equilibrium condition and is continuous and smooth at the  lc .",
    "let us now discuss the physical relevance of our solution to the pulsar problem .",
    "note that the obtained unique solution of our problem has a finite value of the derivative @xmath212 at the equator @xmath213 , namely , @xmath214 , and thus has a non - zero radial magnetic field just above ( and just below ) the equatorial current sheet .",
    "this actually spells bad news for the applicability of our solution .",
    "indeed , one more condition that needs to be satisfied for the solution to be physically relevant and that we have not discussed so far is the condition @xmath215 with @xmath216 related to @xmath217 via equation  ( [ eq-|e| ] ) , this condition can be expressed as @xmath218    we see that this condition is satisfied trivially everywhere inside the  lc , but is not automatically satisfied outside the  lc . in particular , in our solution , and in fact in any solution characterized by @xmath82 , the toroidal field on the last open field line @xmath72 is zero , whereas the poloidal magnetic ( and hence electric ) field is not zero , as our explicit solution shows .",
    "this means that the inequality  ( [ eq - b > e-2 ] ) is violated immediately outside the lc as one moves along the equator .",
    "more generally , this inequality is violated beyond the so - called light surface ( defined as the surface where @xmath219 ) that emanates from the y - point .",
    "it is in fact not difficult to find the location of this light surface in our solution .    indeed , according to equations  ( [ eq - br - ii])([eq - btheta - ii ] ) , we have @xmath220\\ , ,",

    "\\label{eq - theta_ls-1}\\ ] ] for our solution described by the parameters  ( [ eq - alpha_0])([eq - beta&theta_0 ] ) , we find @xmath227 which corresponds to the angle @xmath228",
    ".    beyond the ls ( @xmath229 ) the force - free equation  ( [ eq - force - free ] ) is not applicable .",
    "the solution we have obtained in this section is valid in the region @xmath230 , but , because the process of obtaining this solution also involved the region @xmath229 [ e.g. , via the boundary condition @xmath231 , our solution may not be the correct solution of the overall problem .",
    "in fact , we can make an even more general statement : any relevant to our problem finite - field magnetic configuration with the separatrix intersecting the equator at the  lc can not be almost everywhere ( that is , again , everywhere except at a finite number of infinitesimally thin current sheets ) ideal and force - free beyond the  lc !",
    "indeed , as we saw previously , if one insists on having the separatrix intersection point at the  lc , then one has to contend either with having @xmath232 divergent near @xmath39 or with having @xmath233 .",
    "the latter case , however , is characterized by zero toroidal magnetic field everywhere along the last open field line @xmath72 .",
    "that the poloidal ( radial ) magnetic field does not vanish identically near the equatorial current sheet , it then follows that @xmath234 , and so the force - free equation  ( [ eq - force - free ] ) becomes inapplicable . and",
    ", as our particular solution shows , the condition @xmath235 is violated not only on some singular surfaces of measure zero , such as the equatorial current sheet ( that would be acceptable to us at this stage , since we do expect our simple force - free , ideal - mhd assumptions to break down there anyway ) , but in a volume of non - zero extent in both poloidal directions , e.g. , in the region ( @xmath236,@xmath237 ) .",
    "thus we have to conclude that if one is to keep the hope of finding a force - free solution that would be valid all the way up to infinity ( in the limit of vanishing plasma density ) , or at least to some finite distance beyond the  lc , then one has to make concessions regarding the anticipated location of the separatrix / equator intersection point .",
    "in other words , the requirement that @xmath238 outside the lc means that @xmath81 must be non - zero and this , in turn , forces one to conclude that the intersection point must be located at some finite distance inside the  lc , i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "this scenario has actually been the subject of several studies in the past 20 years ( e.g. , beskin et  al .",
    "1983 ; lyubarskii  1990 ; beskin & malyshkin  1998 ) . according to equation  ( [ eq - sepx - equil-2 ] ) , the corresponding finite-@xmath81 configuration has to be characterized by @xmath239 staying finite in the limit @xmath240 , and , therefore , the separatrix should approach the equator at a right angle , @xmath68 , corresponding to a t - point ( see lyubarskii  1990 ) .",
    "let us now ask what other characteristic features should such a solution possess ? here we present a few simple facts that can be gleaned immediately by inspecting the force - free equation  ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) and its regularity condition ( [ eq - regularity - lc ] ) .",
    "first , since beyond @xmath71 the last open field line , @xmath72 , is assumed to lie along the equator  @xmath61 , the derivative @xmath241 should be zero everywhere along this line ( for @xmath70 ) .",
    "in particular , we should have @xmath242 , but then it follows from equation  ( [ eq - regularity - lc ] ) that either @xmath243 or  @xmath244 has to be zero . since here we are considering the case @xmath86",
    ", we conclude that @xmath35 has to approach @xmath80 with a zero slope , @xmath245 .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath246 can not be a simple linear function , unless it is constant everywhere .",
    "next , by substituting the result @xmath247 , together with @xmath248 , into equation  ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) , we find that @xmath249 for all @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the radial magnetic field also approaches the equator  @xmath61 with a zero slope , @xmath250 .",
    "now let us see what one can deduce by investigating the regularity condition  ( [ eq - regularity - lc ] ) just above the equatorial current sheet .",
    "according to what we have just established , above the equator the function @xmath35 can be expanded as @xmath251 where @xmath252 in order to satisfy the condition @xmath253 , as @xmath124 ( here we again set @xmath111 to simplify notation )",
    ". then we find , to lowest order in @xmath126 , @xmath254    now , the radial magnetic field just above the equator is , in general , not zero , so we can expand @xmath255 to lowest order in @xmath256 as @xmath257 where @xmath258 is in fact just the rescaled electric field above the equator , as can be seen from equations  ( [ eq - e ] ) and  ( [ eq - b_r-2 ] ) : @xmath259    upon substituting equations  ( [ eq - tpoint - rhs ] ) and  ( [ eq - tpoint - psi - z>0 ] ) into the regularity condition  ( [ eq - regularity - lc ] ) , we get @xmath260^{\\beta-1 } \\ , , \\label{eq - tpoint - regularity - lc - z>0}\\ ] ] and , therefore , @xmath261 unless @xmath262 [ and @xmath263 if @xmath264 .    we can now use this result to analyze the magnetic field in the vicinity of the point @xmath265 . equation  ( [ eq - pulsar ] ) in the vicinity of this point can be written as @xmath266 +   { { 1+x_0 ^ 2}\\over",

    "however , a further analysis of this solution in the region outside the light cylinder shows that a light surface ( a surface where @xmath293 ) appears just outside the light cylinder ; in particular , we find that this light surface originates right at the intersection point and extends outward at a finite angle with respect to the equator",
    ". the appearance of a light surface in this case is , of course , not surprising , taking into account the fact that ( in this case of the separatrix intersection point lying at the light cylinder ) the poloidal electric current  @xmath125 and hence the toroidal magnetic field have to become zero on the last open field line .",
    "we therefore conclude that the only possibility for an ideal - mhd force - free magnetosphere above the putative equatorial current sheet to extend at least some finite distance beyond the light cylinder , is for the separatrix intersection point to be located inside , as supposed to right at , the light cylinder .",
    "( of course we understand that the exact location of this point can only be found as a part of a global solution of the pulsar equation and that it is impossible to determine it from our local analysis ) .",
    "these findings give us the motivation to consider the case when the intersection point lies at some finite distance inside the light cylinder . in ",
    "[ sec - t - point ] we examine the behavior of the function @xmath35 near the last open field line @xmath72 ( above the equatorial current sheet ) for this case ; we find that the derivative @xmath294 has to go to zero as @xmath295 , whereas the current itself can approach a finite value @xmath86 .",
    "we then perform an asymptotic analysis of the magnetic field around the intersection point ; it is essentially a somewhat simplified and trivialized analogue of our analysis in   [ sec - analysis ] .",
    "we find that the separatrix approaches the equator at a right angle , @xmath68 , and that the field in the region of open field lines behaves simply as @xmath296 , while in the closed - field region the magnetic field is simply vertical and finite near the intersection point ( we call this configuration the t - point ) .",
    "finally , we would like to make several remarks regarding the numerical simulations by ckf and by ogura & kojima ( 2003 ) :    \\1 ) the midplane boundary conditions ( @xmath297 , @xmath298 ; @xmath51 , @xmath299 ) adopted by both groups have automatically assumed that the separatrix intersection point lies at the  lc , and thus have precluded them from even considering the possibility @xmath64 .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that from the magnetic contour plots presented by ogura & kojima ( 2003 ) it does seem that the actual intersection point lies a little bit inside the  lc .",
    "\\2 ) neither ckf , nor ogura & kojima ( 2003 ) have discussed or even mentioned the separatrix equilibrium condition ; thus it is not clear whether this condition has been satisfied in their simulations . in the light of our present findings and of the fact that both of these groups have found @xmath86",
    ", we suspect that the equilibrium condition has not , in fact , been satisfied in their studies , at least close to the separatrix intersection point .",
    "this suspicion is strengthened by the fact that both groups have reported having experienced some difficulties near the separatrix .",
    "\\3 ) ogura & kojima ( 2003 ) have reported that they had found @xmath300 at some finite distance outside the  lc , whereas ckf have claimed that in their solution @xmath301 everywhere . the origin of this discrepancy",
    "is not clear .",
    "it may be attributed to the difference in numerical resolution , although neither of the two groups have conducted very extensive convergence studies .",
