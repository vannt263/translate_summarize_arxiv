    "the _ asca _",
    "data revealed a very prominent , narrow fe  k@xmath5 emission line , believed to have originated in matter distant from the supermassive black hole ( possibly in the putative obscuring torus ) .",
    "later , x - ray observations with _ bepposax _ ( gilli _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) showed a revival to a high - flux state .",
    "this was accompanied by complex variability in the fe  k@xmath5 line profile , which appeared to have possible contributions from radiation originating in both the accretion disk and distant matter .",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) suggested that the variation in continuum flux was evidence of quenching and revival of accretion on a timescale of years .",
    "in fact , they believed that _ bepposax _ witnessed a revival of the agn between its two observations , which were separated by about a year in the period 19971998 .",

    "we obtained observing time for a one - year monitoring campaign of ngc  2992 with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) beginning in 2005 .",
    "ngc  2992 had never been observed with",
    "_ rxte _ prior to this campaign .",
    "the goal was to test the response of the fe  k@xmath5 line to the variation in the x - ray continuum .",
    "spectral analysis of these data revealed an unexpected result : the variation in flux for the twenty - four _ rxte _ observations covered nearly the entire dynamical range in flux in the historical data in less than a year .",
    "previously it was thought that the variation occurred over decades , but the _ rxte _ data showed flares in the x - ray continuum flux on timescales of days .",
    "additionally , the fe  k@xmath5 emission line ( that is present in the majority of the observations and centered at @xmath6 kev in most cases ) was redshifted and broadened during high - flux periods , implying that we may have been witnessing short - term flaring activity ( on the order of days to weeks ) from the inner regions of the accretion disk .    in  [ obs ]",
    ", we describe the _ rxte _ data and our data reduction process .",
    "we describe the results of our spectral analysis of the data in  [ fitting ] , including a discussion of the variability of the fe  k@xmath5 emission line and the physical implications . in  [ conclusions ] we summarize the conclusions of our analysis . an appendix is included to discuss a calibration feature found in the data in the 89 kev range .",
    "ngc  2992 was observed between 2005 march 4 and 2006 january 28 with the _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca ; jahoda _ et al .",
    "we obtained data from a total of twenty - four observations .",
    "the observation log is given in table  1 ; hereafter we will refer to each observation as obs  1 to 24 as listed in table  1 .",
    "it can be seen that the interval between observations ranged from @xmath7 to 33 days .",
    "the pca is an array of five proportional counter units ( pcus ) , each with a net geometric collecting area of @xmath8 @xmath9 ( jahoda _ et al .",
    "each pcu consists of 3 layers of a mixture of xenon ( 90% ) and methane ( 10% ) gas and a @xmath10 collimator ( fwhm ) . for energies",
    "less than 10 kev , @xmath11 90% of the cosmic photons and 50% of the internal instrumental background are detected in the top layer ( layer 1 ) of the xenon / methane detector .",
    "therefore , in order to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio , only data from layer 1 of the pcus were used .",
    "fewer of the pcus were in operation later in the mission , so we did not obtain data from all five units . for two observations (",
    "obs  2 and obs  3 ) , pcus 0 , 1 , and 2 were operational ; however , only pcu  0 and pcu  2 were operational for _ all _ twenty - four of the ngc  2992 observations . in order to perform a uniform analysis of all of the observations",
    ", we discarded the pcu  1 data for obs  2 and obs  3 , and only used data from pcu  0 and pcu  2 .    in the spring of 2000",
    "( may 12 ) , the propane layer in pcu  0 lost pressure and thus the calibration and background subtraction model were adversely affected ( jahoda _ et al .",
    "since then , the calibration and background estimation have improved , so we retained the pcu  0 data , but performed initial analyses on pcu  0 and pcu  2 separately , in order to check for inconsistencies in the two detectors .",
    "we found the variation in the results from spectral fits to the data from the two detectors to be statistically insignificant . as we will describe in  [ fitting ] , we analyzed the spectra from the combined pcu  0 plus pcu  2 data in addition to the individual pcu data in order to obtain better statistics on the important model parameters .",
    "the data were selected to exclude time intervals when the earth s elevation angle was less than @xmath12 , during passage of the satellite through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , and during times of high electron contamination ( ie , the housekeeping parameter ` electron2 ' was selected to be greater than 0.1 ) .",
    "the background was estimated with the program pcabackest , using the mission - long ` faint ' model file pca_bkgd_cmfaintl7_emv20031123.mdl ( jahoda _ et al .",
    "spectral response matrices were made for each of the observations for both pcu  0 and pcu  2 using pcarmf version 10.1 and the channel - to - energy calibration file pca_e2c_e05v03.fits .",
    "we extracted spectra and light curves for pcu  0 and pcu  2 for each of the twenty - four observations .",
    "in addition , we co - added the pcu  0 and pcu  2 data to make twenty - four combined ( pcu  0  +  pcu  2 ) spectra . in obs  7 and obs  15 , we found flares in the pcu  0 light curves , so we applied further data selection with time cuts to remove those periods from the pcu  0 data .",
    "these selection criteria resulted in net exposure times for the pcu  0  +  pcu  2 data in the range of @xmath13 to @xmath14 ks , as shown in table  1 .",
    "the grand total integration time for the twenty - four observations , summed over pcu  0  +  pcu  2 , was 133.088 ks .",
    "the mean , full - band , background - subtracted count rates for the combined pcu  0  +  pcu  2 data varied by over an order of magnitude , ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 cts / s ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we modeled the pca spectra using xspec version 11.3.2 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "preliminary examination of the spectra revealed poor background subtraction above @xmath17 kev . since the pca data below @xmath18 kev are not well calibrated ( jahoda _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) , we performed spectral fitting in the 315 kev range .",
    "we used @xmath19 as the fit statistic . in all of the model fitting the galactic column was fixed density at @xmath20 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "although the 315 kev energy range is not sensitive to galactic absorption , we included it for consistency with models in the literature that were fitted to lower energy data .",
    "all model parameters will be referred to in the source frame .",
    "we fitted a simple power - law model to each of the spectra for the twenty - four observations , initially for the pcu  0 and pcu  2 data separately and subsequently for the combined pcu data .",
    "this model consisted of two free parameters , namely the photon index ( @xmath21 ) and the power - law normalization .",
    "we found , in most cases , that the plots of the data / model ratios of the twenty - four combined pcu spectra showed residuals that may correspond to the fe  k@xmath5 emission line known to be present in the source ( e.g. weaver _ et al . _ 1996 , gilli _ et al .",
    "each case was confirmed by examining the separate pcu  0 and pcu  2 fits .",
    "we therefore proceeded to fit a power - law plus a gaussian emission - line component to the three sets of twenty - four spectra .",
    "the model consisted of five free parameters : the power - law normalization , @xmath21 , the centroid energy of the line ( @xmath22 ) in kev , the intrinsic line width ( @xmath23 ) in kev , and the intensity of the line ( @xmath24 ) in @xmath25 .",
    "although for eight of the twenty - four fits the probability of obtaining values of @xmath19 as high as those measured from the data by chance was less than 10% , we note that our data do not include compensation for systematic errors so the goodness of fits can not be assessed by consideration of the values of @xmath19 alone .",
    "we will return to this question when discussing fits to grouped data sets (  [ groupfit ] ) . in cases where the line energy could not be constrained ,",
    "the fit was repeated with the fe k@xmath5 energy fixed at the neutral fe value of 6.4 kev . in obs  2224 , where the width of the line could not be constrained ( the line was too weak )",
    ", we fixed the intrinsic gaussian line width at @xmath23 = 0.05 kev in order to obtain statistical errors on the line intensity .",
    "this width is much less than the pca energy resolution ( @xmath26 kev fwhm at 6 kev , jahoda _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) . for seventeen of the twenty - one",
    "remaining data sets , the decrease in @xmath19 ranged from 6.3 to 22.2 for the addition of three free parameters for the line , compared to the continuum - only fits .",
    "this corresponds to detections of the line at a confidence level greater than 90% ( @xmath27 for three parameters ) .",
    "three of the remaining four observations ( obs  2 , 11 , and 12 ) had detections of the line at greater than 68% confidence ( @xmath28 for three parameters ) and one ( obs  15 ) had a detection at only marginally less than 68% confidence ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we compared the values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 that were obtained from spectral fits to the pcu  0 data with those obtained from the pcu  2 data and found no evidence of systematic differences .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "2a and fig .",
    "2b show plots of @xmath21(pcu  0 ) vs. @xmath21(pcu  2 ) and @xmath24 ( pcu  0 ) vs. @xmath24 ( pcu  2 ) respectively . also , the ratios of the data to the model for pcu  0 and pcu  2 showed no systematic anomalies within the statistical errors . therefore , hereafter we refer only to the results obtained from the combined pcu  0  +  pcu  2 spectral fits .",
    "the power - law plus gaussian fit results for the combined pcu data are shown in table  2 .",
    "statistical errors for each parameter in table  2 are 68% confidence for @xmath30 interesting parameters , where @xmath30 = 2 or 3 ( corresponding to @xmath31 = 2.279 and 3.506 respectively ) , depending on the number of parameters that were fixed in order to obtain stable fits during the error analysis .",
    "the power - law normalization is not included as an interesting parameter .",
    "quoting the 68% confidence ( @xmath32 ) errors facilitates statistical analysis of the results .",
    "we also quote ( in brackets , below the best - fit values ) 90% confidence ranges for one interesting parameter ( @xmath31 = 2.706 ) , for comparison with other results in the literature .",
    "parameters that were fixed are labeled with ` @xmath33 ' in table  2 .    for twenty - one of the data sets ,",
    "statistical errors were found for @xmath23 by fixing the line energy at the best - fit value and statistical errors were found for @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath21 by fixing the line width at the best - fit value .",
    "therefore , for these cases , 68% confidence errors were found using @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) for all interesting parameters .",
    "the fits became highly unstable if we allowed both @xmath23 and @xmath22 to be free during the error analysis .",
    "a stable fit for the line was not obtained for obs  22 , 23 , and 24 since the line was not detected with sufficient statistical significance in these observations . in these cases , it was necessary to fix both the line energy at 6.4 kev and the line width at 0.05 kev to obtain statistical errors ( @xmath36 ) for the remaining free parameters ( @xmath24 and @xmath21 ) .      in order to facilitate comparison with the literature",
    ", we calculated the 210 kev continuum flux and luminosity values by extrapolating the 315 kev models down to 2 kev .",
    "the 210 kev fluxes and luminosities are presented in table  2 .",
    "all fluxes are observed - frame values , not corrected for absorption .",
    "all luminosities are rest - frame values , corrected for absorption .    the @xmath37 year light curve ( fig .",
    "3 ) ranges from @xmath38 in 210 kev flux .",
    "the 210 kev luminosity ranges from @xmath39 to @xmath40 ergs @xmath41 ( assuming @xmath42",
    "km s@xmath43 mpc@xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , while the fraction of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath46 ) ranges from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , assuming a black hole mass of @xmath49 ( woo & urry 2002 ) .",
    "historically , @xmath46 has ranged from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "the first _ rxte _ observation , which had the highest flux , was followed by two additional high - flux peaks ( obs  4 and obs  8) .",
    "the flux then dropped to @xmath52 during obs  9 to obs  12 .",
    "this was followed by a slight rise in flux for obs  13 and obs  14 .",
    "the flux measurements in the remaining observations stayed in the @xmath53 range , with the last three appearing to make an upward turn .",
    "we quantified the variability in the _ rxte _ light curve by calculating the fractional variability amplitude , @xmath54 , comparing this measure of variability with results obtained from _",
    "monitoring of other agn ( e.g. see vaughan _",
    "_ 2003 ; markowitz _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ; markowitz & edelson 2004 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath54 is simply the square root of the excess variance , that is also used to characterize agn variability , taking into account poisson noise ( e.g. see turner _",
    "et al . _ 1999 ) .",
    "markowitz & edelson ( 2004 ) calculated @xmath54 uniformly for a sample of agn , based on 212  kev _ rxte _ pca count rates , and several monitoring durations , one of which was 216 days .",
    "using the same energy band for ngc  2992 , we obtained @xmath55 , and @xmath56 for all 24 observations , the first 16 observations ( 207 days duration ) , and the last 14 observations ( 211 days duration ) , respectively .",
    "our observations of ngc  2992 were spaced roughly two weeks apart except for two pairs of observations for which each pair had a separation of only three days .",
    "the count rates from these pairs of observations were averaged in order to obtain roughly equal spacing in time intervals before calculating @xmath54 .",
    "markowitz & edelson ( 2004 ) found that the majority of the agn in their sample had 216-day values of @xmath54 lying the range @xmath57 , and the two sources with the highest values of @xmath54 of @xmath58 were ngc  3227 and ngc  4051 ( both of these have x - ray luminosities that are similar to the luminosity of ngc  2992 ) .",
    "thus the high value of @xmath54 obtained for the first part of the _ rxte _ ngc  2992 campaign ( and indeed for the whole campaign ) is exceptionally high .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath54 obtained for the second part of the campaign ( in which ngc  2992 was much `` quieter '' ) is still at the high end of the range that was obtained by markowitz & edelson ( 2004 ) for their sample of agn .",
    "we can compare the timescales probed by our _ rxte _ campaign with the expected break frequency , @xmath59 , given the black - hole mass , based on a correlation observed from studying samples of seyfert galaxies and other black - hole systems ( e.g. papadakis 2004 finds @xmath60 $ ]  hz ; see also mchardy _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "this break frequency marks the division where the power spectrum flattens from @xmath61 to @xmath62 towards lower frequencies .",
    "for ngc  2992 the predicted timescale corresponding to the break frequency is @xmath63 days . on the other hand , if we use the relation between the break timescale and luminosity that mchardy _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) empirically from studying a sample of agn , we obatined @xmath64 days .",
    "clearly , more frequent sampling than that achieved in our monitoring of ngc  2992 is required in order to derive reliable , direct , quantitative constraints on the power - spectrum amplitude and break frequency ( or timescale ) .",

    ", @xmath92 corresponds to the shallowest theoretical line shown on fig .  6 ( labeled with ` 0.1 ' ) , which is not a good representation of these data .",
    "better agreement is given by a larger value of @xmath84 , implying that the line - of - sight @xmath80 is not representative of the entire system and/or the observed variation in the line intensity is affected by time delays following continuum variations .",

    "the two cases correspond to whether or not the structure s orientation and/or geometry is such that it intercepts the line - of - sight between the x - ray continuum source ( that illuminates the reprocessor to produce the fe  k emission line ) and the observer .",
    "if the x - ray continuum is obscured , then the fe  k line ew can be in the range of hundreds to thousands of ev , but if it is not ( in which case the fe  k line is observed in ` reflection ' - i.e. from the same surface that is illuminated by the continuum ) the ew is typically not more than @xmath94  ev .",
    "examples of monte carlo simulations of such scenarios can be found in ghisellini _",
    "( 1994 ) and references therein .",
    "what is apparent from these calculations is that for a given geometry and orientation , the ew of the fe  k line , as a function of the value of the highest column density through the reprocessor , reaches an asymptotic value once the structure becomes compton - thick .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of simple estimates and comparison with the compton - thin case , one can parameterize all of the compton - thick models by the asymptotic value of the fe  k line ew _ for the time - steady , static limit for a constant x - ray continuum_. we can then express the intensity of the fe  k line in terms of the 210  kev luminosity of a steady - state illuminating x - ray continuum and directly compare that with the compton - thin scenario . for the compton - thick case",

    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "6 that the _ rxte _ data points cover the range of theoretical values of the ew from 100 to 1000 ev for @xmath92 , and therefore the data do not rule out either extreme of reflection or transmission through a compton - thick reprocessor",
    ". however , the case of transmission ( ew=1000 ev ) appears to be unlikely since this would require the historically averaged luminosity ( @xmath76 ) to be lower than than the _ rxte _ luminosities in order to fit the data .",

    "we used different y - axis scales on these plots in order to clearly display the spectral features .",
    "we found , again , clear residuals at @xmath6 kev for each of groups 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 . in group 1",
    "the residuals appeared to peak at an energy lower than 6.4 kev , while in group 6 no line - like residuals were evident .",
    "we fitted the data again , adding a gaussian component to model fe  k@xmath5 line emission .",
    "table  3 gives the results of these fits and the plots of the ratios of the data to this model are shown in fig .",
    "the results were consistent with those from the individual observations .",
    "the addition of a gaussian component to the model gave a better fit for groups 1 through 5 , with @xmath19 decreasing by at least 19.9 for the addition of three free parameters .",
    "however , the absolute @xmath19 values remained high .",
    "although table  3 shows that the probability of obtaining these values by chance is very small , the @xmath19 values do not take into account systematic errors in the data and therefore are not an adequate assessment of the goodness of the model fits .",
    "the fe  k@xmath5 line was not significantly detected in group 6 .",
    "however , we were able to derive a line intensity with a non - zero lower limit ( at 68% confidence ) by fixing the line centroid energy and width ( @xmath23 ) at 6.4 kev and 0.05 kev respectively ( see table  3 ) .",
    "the 210 kev flux ranged from @xmath102 to @xmath103 .",
    "the photon index ranged from @xmath104 to @xmath105 , with a weighted mean of @xmath106 .",
    "the emission line energy appeared to be consistent with the neutral fe value of 6.4 kev except for group 1 , the high - flux group , where the centroid peaked at @xmath107 kev . excluding group 6 ,",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath23 ranged from 0.00 to 0.89 and the best - fit ew of the line ranged from @xmath108 to @xmath109 ev .",
    "the weighted mean value of @xmath24 for all six groups was @xmath110 and the weighted mean value for groups 2 through 5 , where the 6.4 kev fe  k line dominated , was @xmath111 .",
    "we directly compared the results from the grouped data fits with the results from the individual - observation fits by over - plotting the group values on the figures discussed in  [ indfits ] .",
    "the grouped data points are marked with crosses in fig .",
    "4 , fig .  5 , fig .  6 , and fig .",
    "like @xmath21 , the ew of the fe  k@xmath5 line did not appear to vary significantly between the groups ( corresponding to a weighted mean value of @xmath112 ev for groups 1 through 5 ) , although the ew values are consistent with the trend of being smaller for higher continuum luminosities .",
    "however , within the 68% confidence errors , the intensity of the fe  k@xmath5 line appears to be higher during the high - luminosity observations , as shown in fig .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "5 shows the distinct difference in the energy of the fe  k@xmath5 line between the high - luminosity grouped data and the lower - luminosity grouped data .",
    "we investigate this further in  [ highlow ] .    in fig .",
    "10 we see that there sometimes appears to be a statistically significant ` dip ' in the spectrum between @xmath113 and 9 kev . even though the residuals in this region are sometimes as large as those in the fe k band ( when compared to a simple power - law ) , we believe that the 89 kev dip is an artifact of the background subtraction model and we are confident that the fe  k emission - line measurements are reliable because they are in large part consistent with our knowledge from observations and measurements with other missions .",
    "our reasons for believing that the 89 kev dip is an artifact are detailed in the appendix .",
    "since such an artifact in the spectrum can adversely affect fitted values of the model parameters when a compton - reflection continuum is included in the model , we omitted three spectral channels ( in the range of 7.79.5 kev ) in subsequent spectral fitting to remove the dip .",
    "the effect of compton reflection is important to consider when modeling spectra of agns ( e.g. reynolds & nowak 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "although the _ rxte _ spectral band used here is not very sensitive to a compton - reflection continuum , we added a reflection component to our model ( hrefl in xspec ; see doviak , karas , & yaqoob 2004 ) in order to ensure that our results are robust .",
    "the resulting model has six free parameters including the so - called reflection fraction , @xmath114 , in addition to the power - law normalization , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath114 is the normalization of the reflection continuum relative to that expected from a steady - state , x - ray illuminated , neutral disk subtending a solid angle of @xmath115 at the x - ray source .",
    "the compton - reflection model used here assumes a centrally illuminated , neutral , infinite disk with the abundance of fe fixed at the solar value from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "we investigated the variation in @xmath24 for values of @xmath114 between 0 to 3 by creating confidence contours of @xmath24 versus @xmath114 .",
    "we found in general that the best fit value of @xmath114 was consistent with 0 and that it did not significantly impact the value of @xmath24 .",
    "the 99% confidence contours were open and flat over the range in @xmath114 considered but the spectral ratios to a simple power - law model indicated we should have obtained an upper limit in the searched range of @xmath116 , or at least that the contours should have begun to close .",
    "unfortunately , what is happening is that the limited energy resolution , bandpass and signal - to - noise ratio of the data results in steep intrinsic continuua with strong reflection degenerate with intrinsically flatter continuua with little reflection .",
    "thus , upper limits on @xmath114 for these data are not necessarily physically meaningful . however , using _ bepposax _ data with pds coverage out to beyond 100  kev , gilli _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) found that compton reflection was in fact weak in ngc  2992 ( see also beckmann _ et al .",
    "our main concern here is that the fe  k emission line intensities are not sensitive to assumptions about the compton reflection continuum and with the above considerations in mind , we did not include compton reflection in most of the spectral fits described below ( and we will note those for which it is included ) .",
    "when we do include a compton reflection continuum in the model , it is only a single component , although two components might be expected .",
    "one component might be associated with the fe  k line from an accretion disk , and the other from distant matter ( if it is compton - thick ) .",
    "however the quality of the data and the restricted bandpass does not warrant modeling multiple compton - reflection components so the value of @xmath114 then represents the relative amplitude of all reflection components that might be present in the data .      in order to explore the apparent difference between the high- and low - flux states further , we combined all of the spectra from the observations which made up groups 3 , 4 , and 5 ( low - flux ) to compare with the group 1 ( high - flux ) spectrum .",
    "we did not include group 6 in the low - flux spectrum since the fe  k@xmath5 line was not significantly detected in these observations .",
    "confidence contour plots of @xmath24 versus @xmath22 for the high- and low - flux groups are shown in fig .",
    "the model used included galactic absorption , a power - law continuum , and a gaussian line .",
    "interestingly , the contours for the two sets of data are mutually exclusive at 99% confidence . as can be seen in fig .  6",
    ", we did not detect the same order of magnitude increase in intensity of the fe  k@xmath5 line as in the 210 kev continuum luminosity .",
    "we do , however , see a broadening as well as a significant shift in the centroid energy of the detected fe  k@xmath5 line from @xmath117 kev in the low state to @xmath67 kev in the high state .",
    "it is possible that we are seeing two different components of the fe  k@xmath5 line complex : a component ( with a centroid energy near 5.6 kev ) , originating in the accretion disk close to the black hole , that is broadened and redshifted due to doppler and gravitational effects , and a narrow component ( with a centroid energy closer to 6.4 kev ) from more distant material .",
    "the increase in the redshifted line flux in the high state may be due to a localized flare close to the black hole .",
    "we investigated the extent to which the redshifted , broad fe  k emission component and the narrow , distant - matter fe  k line may be present in both the low- and high - flux states by fitting both high- and low - flux groups with a second gaussian added to the previous power law plus gaussian line model .",
    "we fixed the centroid energy of one gaussian at 6.3 kev , the best - fit value for the low - flux group in the previous , single gaussian fit and we fixed the other at 5.6 kev , the corresponding best - fit value for the high - flux group .",
    "the confidence contours of the dual gaussian fit for the two groups are shown in fig .",
    "the contours for the two groups are mutually exclusive only up to 90% confidence .",
    "the contours show that it is not required that both components exist in both of the data sets ( only a broad line is definitively detected in the high - flux group , only a narrow line in the low - flux group ) . on the other hand , at 99% confidence , both of the components may be present in both the high- and the low - flux states .    in order to determine the implications for the proximity of the flaring region to the black hole",
    ", we fitted a disk - line component in xspec ( see fabian _ et al . _",
    "1989 ) to the high flux data in order to model the redshifted line .",
    "the parameters of the disk - line model are the rest - frame line energy ( @xmath118 ) , the power law index of the emissivity ( @xmath119 , where the emissivity@xmath120 ) , the inner and outer radii of the disk emission ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively ) relative to the central black hole , and the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line - of - sight of the observer ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "we included a power - law continuum component in the model as well as a gaussian component with the line energy ( @xmath22 ) fixed at 6.4 kev and @xmath23 at 0.05 kev in order to model a possible narrow component to the fe  k line complex ( although none was detected ) .",
    "for this fit , we also included compton reflection ( as described in  [ reflection ] ) since the parameter constraints may be different when the emission line is modeled as a disk line rather than a gaussian .",
    "therefore , this model had five free parameters : @xmath21 , @xmath24 , the reflection fraction ( @xmath114 ) , @xmath124 , and @xmath122 .",
    "we fixed @xmath125 kev in the rest frame , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "this value of @xmath119 is consistent with the value found from suzaku data ( see yaqoob _",
    "the data certainly do not rule out steeper emissivity laws ( @xmath128 to @xmath129 may be more typical in agn ) , and indeed some theoretical models predict very steep emissivity laws with @xmath130 .",
    "however , @xmath119 is degenerate with @xmath122 : steeper values of @xmath119 will result in larger allowed values of @xmath122 for the same data because steep emissivity laws by definition give most of the line emission from the innermost regions of the disk and @xmath122 eventually becomes irrelevant .",
    "therefore , by using @xmath127 we are addressing the question of what is the largest size of the region that can account for the redshifted fe  k line because more negative values of @xmath119 will automatically produce more of the line from a smaller region for a given value of @xmath122 .",
    "we found that @xmath123 was constrained to be @xmath131 ( 90% confidence ) and this is not sensitive to @xmath119 as the same upper limit was obtained when @xmath119 was fixed at @xmath132 .",
    "the inclination angle constraint is consistent with @xmath133 obtained from modeling the persistent disk line emission in suzaku data ( yaqoob _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ) .",
    "we plotted confidence contours of the intensity of the disk line versus the outer radius and found that at 99% confidence , the line originated within @xmath0 gravitational radii of the black hole ( see fig .",
    "thus , in the context of our interpretation that the redshifted broad component of the fe  k emission line is due to the line emission from the inner disk in the high state being temporarily enhanced during continuum flares , we deduce that the enhanced region is smaller than @xmath134 gravitational radii .",
    "a similar event was observed in the seyfert galaxy mcg  -6 - 30 - 15 by iwasawa _",
    "( 1999 ) in which the fe  k line centroid shifted to @xmath135 kev and the 6.4 kev component was not the prominent peak as it usually is in that source .",
    "although the narrow line emission may have been present during the high - flux state of ngc  2992 , it is possible that the continuum swamped the line so that we were unable to detect it .",
    "the quasi - simultaneous suzaku observations of ngc  2992 ( see fig .  3 ; yaqoob _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ) showed evidence of a persistent , broad , disk line component with an intensity of @xmath136 photons @xmath137 s@xmath43 ( 90% confidence for one interesting parameter ) .",
    "such a disk line likely originates from a larger region of the disk than that found in the _ rxte _ flare spectra and so does not have a highly redshifted centroid energy compared to 6.4 kev because there is relatively more line emission from larger radii . in the _ rxte _ data",
    ", we found the upper limits on the intensity of a persistent , extended ( @xmath138 ) disk line ( at 6.4 kev in the rest frame of the disk ) for the high- and low - flux groups to be @xmath139 and @xmath140 photons @xmath137 s@xmath43 ( 90% confidence for one interesting parameter ) respectively .",
    "thus , the continuous presence of a persistent disk line with the line intensity observed in the suzaku data , in addition to the flaring disk line and the distant matter component , is not ruled out by the _",
    "_ data .",
    "the flaring behavior in the _ rxte _ data strongly supports the idea that x - rays originate in a corona above the accretion disk .",
    "if the x - ray source is in fact a corona above the disk , a flare from the inner region of the disk could significantly intensify a particular part of the line profile , making the whole line appear to be redshifted .",
    "on the other hand , a flaring , centrally located source would simply intensify the entire line and therefore the centroid would not be redshifted .",
    "the slope of the power - law continuum ( @xmath21 ) potentially holds important information about the temperature ( @xmath141 ) and optical depth ( @xmath142 ) of this plasma from which the x - rays are thought to originate .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath21 , is proportional to the compton @xmath143 parameter which is a function of the product @xmath144 .",
    "inclusion of x - ray data at higher energies than our _ rxte _ data is needed because @xmath141 could then be constrained directly by the data and then @xmath142 could be derived from fitting comptonization models ( e.g. see titarchuk 1994 ) .",
    "although high - energy data is available for the two _ bepposax _ observations of ngc  2992 , gilli _ et al .",
    "_ ( 2000 ) did not address the question of constraining the high - energy cut - off of the power - law continuum ( the cut - off was arbitrarily fixed in their model fitting ) .",
    "however , beckmann _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) find no evidence for a cut - off out to @xmath108 kev , based on analyses of _ bepposax _ , _ integral _ , and _ swift _ data , implying that the scattering corona is compton - thin . if @xmath21 is truly constant during the large amplitude variation ( see fig .  4 ) , then this would imply that the compton @xmath143 parameter remains steady and any accretion model must account for this .",
    "* the _ rxte _ light curve ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows that the flux varied by approximately a factor of 10 on timescales of days to weeks .",
    "it was previously thought that this agn went through an extended period of quiescence over many years , followed by a ` rebuilding ' of the accretion disk ( see  [ intro ] ) .",
    "however , in less than a year the _ rxte _ data covered nearly the entire dynamic range in flux seen in the historical data ( fig .  1 ) , suggesting short - term flaring activity as opposed to long - term changes in accretion activity .",
    "historically , when ngc  2992 was observed in a high - flux state , it exhibited properties of a type 1 agn , such as broad optical lines and rapid x - ray variability , as opposed to when it was in a low - flux state during which it showed properties more consistent with a type 2 agn .",
    "this transitioning behavior challenges the unified model and its theoretical predictions . * in most of the observations ,",
    "an emission line was detected at @xmath6 kev , likely dominated by the fe  k@xmath5 emission line that is known to come from distant matter .",
    "the flux variability of the fe line was much less than the continuum variability . due to the poor energy resolution of _ rxte",
    "_ , the measured intensity of the dominant line component likely has contributions from matter closer to the black hole ( e.g. , the accretion disk ) as well .",
    "the best - fitting ew ranged from @xmath108 to @xmath145 ev , which is consistent with the bulk of the line emission at 6.4 kev having been unresponsive to continuum variability .",
    "* in the three highest luminosity observations , a highly redshifted ( @xmath22 @xmath67 kev ) , broadened fe line dominated the spectrum and the 6.4 kev component was not detected .",
    "the redshifted line may be a signature of flaring activity from the inner disk , likely coming from within @xmath146 gravitational radii of the black hole ( see fig .",
    "13 ) , where strong gravitational and doppler effects are important .",
    "although a distant - matter fe  k line component is not detected during the flares , it is not ruled out . while the high - luminosity observations may be dominated by flaring in the inner disk , both",
    "the low- and high - luminosity data allow for additional , persistent fe  k line disk emission from the whole disk , as seen by suzaku ( yaqoob _ et al .",
    "_ data are not sensitive to this persistent component . * although the continuum luminosity varied by a factor of @xmath147 , the slope of the power - law fit was consistent with no variability ( weighted mean @xmath148 ) . in terms of comptonization models , this implies a roughly constant compton @xmath143 parameter , a fact which must be explained by any general model of accretion onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "future monitoring of ngc  2992 with higher spectral resolution will be able to resolve the fe  k line complex and will improve our understanding of the accretion disk and the structure in general of this source .",
    "observations at higher energies ( which will allow us to determine constraints on the plasma temperature and therefore the compton @xmath143 parameter , as well as better constraints on compton reflection ) , combined with multi - waveband monitoring will be critical to constraining black hole accretion models .",

    "most of the _ rxte _ data sets of ngc  2992 show a dip in both the pcu  0 and pcu  2 spectra near 89 kev ( see  [ groupfit ] ) . the strength of this apparent absorption feature relative to the continuum appears to be variable , with the center depth reaching 030% below the continuum ( see fig .",
    "although there does not appear to be a simple relation between source flux and dip strength , the dip is always weak ( @xmath149% ) in the high - flux spectra and is stronger in most of the low - flux spectra .",
    "however , group 6 ( see fig .  3 ) , which was a low - flux observation where the fe  k line was not detected , does not show the dip .",
    "we believe that the dip may be an artifact of the background subtraction model in _",

    "( 2006 ) presented _ rxte _ data for cen  a from observations made much earlier than those of ngc  2992 but they did not detect the dip feature . therefore",
