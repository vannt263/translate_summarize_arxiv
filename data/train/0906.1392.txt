    "sandpile models are the prime example of self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite , or scale - invariance in the apparent absence of control parameters @xcite . in sandpiles",
    ", soc arises via a control mechanism that forces the system , which possesses an absorbing - state phase transition , to its critical point @xcite .",
    "soc in a slowly - driven sandpile corresponds to an absorbing - state phase transition in the _ conserved _ sandpile , which has the same local dynamics , but a fixed number of particles @xcite .",
    "conserved sandpiles are characterized by a nonconserved order parameter ( the activity density ) which is coupled to a conserved field that does not evolve in regions devoid of activity @xcite .",
    "this class , known as conserved directed percolation ( cdp ) , is distinct from that of standard directed percolation @xcite .    in recent years",
    "considerable progress has been made in characterizing the critical properties of conserved stochastic sandpiles , although no complete , reliable theory is yet at hand .",
    "as is often the case in critical phenomena , theoretical understanding of scaling and universality rests on the analysis of a continuum field theory or langevin equation ( a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation ) that reproduces the phase diagram and captures the fundamental symmetries and conservation laws of the system .",
    "important steps in this direction are the recent numerical studies of a langevin equation @xcite for cdp .",
    "the critical exponent values reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are in good agreement with those found in simulations of conserved lattice gas ( clg ) models @xcite , which exhibit the same symmetries and conservation laws as stochastic sandpiles .",
    "the langevin equation exponents are also consistent with the best available estimates for stochastic sandpiles in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "there is now good evidence that the one - dimensional stochastic sandpile belongs to the cdp universality class @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on an aspect of sandpiles that has received relatively little attention : diffusion .",
    "since the dynamics in these models involves hopping of particles between neighboring sites , one expects the particle diffusion constant @xmath3 to follow a scaling behavior similar to that of the usual order parameter @xmath4 .",
    "( a site is active if it bears two or more particles . ) here @xmath3 is defined via the relation @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the particle displacement .",
    "we determine the scaling properties of the diffusion constant in extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "theoretical studies of the particle diffusion coefficient are hampered by the fact that positions of specific particles are not accessible in the usual stochastic description ; instead the master equation describes the evolution of the probability distribution on the set of occupation numbers @xmath7 .",
    "it is however possible to determine the _ collective _ diffusion coefficient @xmath8 by studying how a density perturbation @xmath9 relaxes .",
    "@xmath8 is related to the relaxation time , @xmath10 , of this mode via @xmath11 , in the small-@xmath12 limit . using the path - integral based perturbation theory developed in @xcite",
    ", we calculate the first three terms in the expansion of @xmath8 in inverse powers of density @xmath13 , for the stochastic sandpile in which the toppling rate is @xmath1 .",
    "the balance of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we define the three models of interest .",

    "we study three versions of the one - dimensional conserved stochastic sandpile , related to manna s model @xcite . in these systems",
    "the configuration is defined by the set of occupation variables @xmath14 , giving the number of particles residing at each site on a ring of size @xmath15 .",
    "all three versions are continuous - time markov processes , in which transitions involve the  toppling \" of an active site , i.e. , one with @xmath16 .",
    "the particular features distinguishing the three models are as follows .    _ basic unrestricted model ( i ) _ @xcite .",
    "each active site has a rate of unity to topple . when site @xmath17 topples , two particles are transferred from this site to its neighboring sites ( @xmath18 and/or @xmath19 , with periodic boundaries ) .",
    "the two particles jump independently ; they jump to the left or to the right with equal probabilities .    _ restricted model ( ii ) _ @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is that of model i except that no site may have more than two particles . if , when a site topples , a particle attempts to jump to a site bearing two particles , it returns to the toppling site .",
    "_ modified unrestricted model ( iii ) .",
    "the dynamics is that of model i except that the rate at which a site topples is given by @xmath20 .    while somewhat less convenient for simulation , model iii is better suited to operator - based theoretical approaches .",
    "model ii features a smaller set of states , rendering it more convenient for analysis via cluster approximations @xcite .",
    "there is clear numerical evidence that model ii belongs to the cdp universality class @xcite ; models i and iii share the same symmetries and conserved quantities as model ii and so are expected to belong to the cdp class as well .    in conserved sandpiles , the particle density @xmath13 serves as a temperaturelike control parameter .",
    "below a certain critical value , @xmath21 , the system eventually falls into an absorbing configuration ( i.e. , one devoid of active sites ) , while for @xmath22 , activity continues indefinitely , in the infinite - size limit .",
    "the order parameter associated with this absorbing - state phase transition is the activity density @xmath4 , given by the stationary mean fraction of active sites in models i and ii , and the stationary average @xmath23 in model iii . numerical studies strongly support a continuous transition at @xmath21 ; best estimates for the critical density @xmath21 are 0.9488 , 0.92978 , and 0.9493 , in models i , ii , and ii , respectively .",
    "( note that for @xmath24 active sites always exist ; @xmath21 , however , is strictly less than unity . )",
    "in this section we report simulation results for the particle diffusion rate @xmath3 and the activity density @xmath4 in models i and ii . for each particle",
    "@xmath25 , let @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the numbers of hops taken by particle in the positive ( respectively , negative ) directions up to time @xmath29",
    ". then the particle diffusion rate is defined through the relation    @xmath30 ^ 2 \\rangle = 2 d t \\label{deffd}\\ ] ]    where the average is over all particles and ( in principle ) all histories of the system of @xmath31 particles on @xmath15 sites , starting from a given initial configuration or class of configurations .",
    "( in practice we generate initial configurations by adding particles randomly to the system , with the prohibition , in the case of model ii , of triple or higher occupancy .",
    "we average over a set of @xmath32 realizations of the process . )",
    "note that the diffusion rate @xmath3 defined above depends in general on the time @xmath29 as well as on @xmath15 and @xmath13 .",
    "determination of @xmath3 in simulations requires that we store the particle displacements , which is not necessary if we merely wish to study the activity density .",
    "since @xmath33 refers to a given history of the process , the quasistationary simulation method used in @xcite is not applicable here .",
    "each time particle @xmath25 hops , @xmath34 changes by @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 ^ 2 \\rangle = \\langle h_j^+ ( t ) + h_j^- ( t ) \\rangle \\equiv \\langle h_j ( t ) \\rangle$ ] , i.e. , the mean number of jumps up to time @xmath29",
    ". particle @xmath25 must be at an active site in order to jump , but @xmath37 is not simply equal to @xmath38 , as would be the case if particle @xmath25 were always to jump each time the site it resides at topples . in model",
    "i , for example , the probability of a given particle jumping is @xmath39 , if it is one of @xmath0 particles at the toppling site . in model ii , the particle always tries to hop when its host site topples , by it may be unable to move to the target site .",
    "finally , in model iii a particle at a site with occupation @xmath0 hops at a rate of @xmath40 , so that the hopping rate actually grows with the occupation number @xmath0 . since the occupancies of nearby sites are correlated , the waiting times between successive displacements of a given particle are not independent . for these reasons ,",
    "the relation between the hopping rate and the activity density involves subtle effects , different in each of the three models studied .",
    "it is nevertheless reasonable to expect that , as @xmath41 , the scaling behavior of the diffusion rate will parallel that of the activity density . in particular , we might expect @xmath4 and @xmath3 to be governed by the same set of critical exponents at the transition .",
    "we simulate models i and ii on rings of @xmath42 6250 , 12500 , 25000 , and 50000 sites , using eight independent realizations for the smallest size , six for @xmath43 , and four for the two largest sizes .",
    "the studies are run for 10@xmath44 to @xmath45 time units , with the longest simulation times near the critical point .",
    "each particle is assigned a label so that its cumulative dislocation @xmath34 can be followed during the evolution . in model ii",
    ", when two particles attempt to jump to the same site , and this site is singly occupied , one of the two particles is chosen at random to move to the target site , while the other remains where it is .",
    "we monitor the diffusion rate @xmath46 , defined in eq ( [ deffd ] ) , and confirm that it approaches a stationary value at long times . figs .",
    "[ d_nao_restrito ] and [ d_restrito ] show the stationary value , @xmath3 , as a function of @xmath47 , for models i and ii , respectively .",
    "several aspects of these results are worth commenting on .",
    "first , for the sizes considered here , @xmath3 is apparently well converged to its limiting ( @xmath48 ) value for @xmath49 .",
    "second , even for values of @xmath50 such that the diffusion rate has converged , the slope of @xmath51 on logarithmic scales changes appreciably with @xmath50 , making a reliable estimate of @xmath52 difficult .",
    "finally , in model ii , @xmath3 drops sharply as @xmath13 approaches 2 : due to the height restriction , most particles can not move .",
    "the corresponding results for the activity density @xmath4 are shown in figs .",
    "[ rho_nao_restrito ] and [ rho_restrito ] , respectively .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in both models appear quite similar , an impression that is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ dandr50 ] , which compares both quantities ( in both models ) , for the largest system studied . near the transition , @xmath4 and @xmath3",
    "are virtually identical in the unrestricted model , while in model ii they appear to be proportional .",
    "it is evident that neither @xmath4 nor @xmath3 can be characterized as following a simple power law , an observation already made for the order parameter in model ii in @xcite .",
    "note that for the system sizes studied here , there is no discernable finite - size effect for @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath51 and @xmath54 do not follow simple power laws in this regime , there is no possibility of maintaining the data collapse under the usual kind of fss scaling plot , that is , of @xmath55 versus @xmath56 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , a data collapse can only be achieved in the regime very near the critical point ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) ; and example of a data collapse for the diffusion rate data is shown in fig .",
    "[ dnrcol ] . in model",
    "i the data collapse is best using exponent values @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; the corresponding values in model ii are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these values are consistent with those reported in @xcite : @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we may therefore affirm , with a high degree of confidence , that models i and ii belong to the same universality class , and that the diffusion rate and the order parameter exhibit the same critical scaling properties .    in the paradigmatic examples of absorbing - state phase transitions , such as the contact process @xcite , starting from a spatially homogeneous initial distribution , the order parameter exhibits an initial power - law decay , @xmath64 , at the critical point , before saturating at a quasistationary value .",
    "( note that the power - law portion of the evolution is independent of system size . )",
    "it is of interest to know whether the order parameter and the diffusion rate exhibit similar behavior in the stochastic sandpile .",
    "our results ( fig .",
    "[ rdvst ] ) for @xmath65 show @xmath4 and @xmath3 decaying with an exponent @xmath66 .",
    "we also perform simulations of the spread of activity with time . in this case , a single site is given two particles initially , while the remaining @xmath67 particles are distributed at random , one per site , over the rest of the lattice . in the contact process at criticality , starting with a single active site , the number of active sites grows as @xmath68 @xcite . in the present case",
    "we find that both @xmath3 and @xmath4 follow an approximate power law with an exponent @xmath69 , as shown in fig .",
