    "quantum random walk is a theoretical concept conceived to simulate certain algorithms using quantum mechanical elements , i.e.  unitary operators and measurements @xcite . in particular , it has been shown recently that it is possible to use a quantum random walk to perform a search in a database with the topology of the hypercube faster that it can be done classically @xcite .",
    "it is an oracle based algorithm , which is optimal in its speed .",
    "another successful application of quantum random walks has been demonstrated by childs , _ et al .",
    "_ citechilds2003 who have also constructed an oracle problem that can be solved by a quantum algorithm exploiting quantum random walk exponentially faster than any classical algorithm .",
    "these two examples justify the general hope that quantum random walks might be able to solve some problems , based on random processes @xcite ( e.g.  monte carlo methods , 2-sat , graph connectivity , etc . ) faster than corresponding classical algorithms .",
    "in general , there are essentially three types of quantum random walks .",
    "firstly , let us mention the so - called coined quantum random walk ( cqrw ) , that is a discrete time walk which makes use of an additional quantum system , the coin @xcite .",
    "the second type of the quantum random walks is described by a continuous ( hamiltonian ) dynamics of a quantum system @xcite .",
    "the third type of quantum random walks based on physical model of optical multiports has been recently been introduced by m. hillery _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "before we proceed we note , that a quantum random walk as discussed by d. aharonov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is basically a mapping @xmath0 , which is updated at each step by a function @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is a graph with vertices @xmath3 and edges @xmath4 .",
    "we therefore can say that quantum random walk is a special instance of the quantum cellular automaton @xcite .",
    "the classical cellular automaton is a concept general enough to accommodate virtually any algorithm ; more precisely , any turing machine can be simulated using a cellular automaton .",
    "the cqrw is usually defined on regular graphs ( each vertex having the same number of outgoing edges ) .",
    "the definition on non - regular graphs is also possible , and some interesting algorithms are based on this version @xcite .",
    "however , the latter version does not possess the symmetries of the former one , nor its neat tensor product structure ( the unitary evolution operator cqrw on the regular cayley graph commute with generators of the underlying group ) .",
    "instead , the whole graph must be addressed , by means of an oracle which tells us whether any two vertices are connected by an edge @xcite , which causes a considerable growth of the resources .    in this paper",
    "we will focus our attention on a quantum - optical model of multiports @xcite which describes a possible physical realization of specific quantum random walks . in this scheme",
    ", we have an array of multiports ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , interconnected with optical paths .",
    "a photon is launched into one path and is transformed by the action of the multiports .",
    "this action can be described as a scattering process , therefore , we will refer to this scheme as the scattering quantum random walk ( sqrw ) .",
    "the sqrw is more viable from the experimental point of view , can be extended to non - regular graphs and is equivalent to cqrw on the regular graphs .",
    "we will investigate a particular arrangement of the multiports when are localized at the vertices of a hypercube .",
    "the array of multiports effectively acts as a scattering potential , when connected to semi - infinite tails .",
    "it can be endowed with two characteristic values , the reflection and transmission amplitude for photons .",
    "this was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for a special two - dimensional hypercube .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : definition ] we define the sqrw on the hypercube . in sec .",
    "[ sec : topology ] we show how the sqrw on the hypercube may be reduced to the cellular automaton on the line . in addition",
    "we will compute the hitting amplitude and we will make some other simulations . in sec . [",
    "sec : potential ] we will investigate scattering properties of the hypercube connected to semi - infinite tails . sec .",
    "[ sec : superset ] contains the proof that the sqrw is equivalent to a generalized version of the coined quantum random walk . in sec .",
    "[ sec : implementation ] we show how to implement the sqrw efficiently on the quantum circuit . in sec .",
    "[ sec : search ] we discuss one possible version of search algorithm using the sqrw . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : symmetries ] , we will analyze symmetries that underlie the sqrw and which may considerably simplify the solution of the model .",
    "the sqrw was first presented in @xcite .",
    "the technique behind its implementation are the multiports @xcite : linear optical elements , interconnected with optical paths .",
    "each multiport has in general different number of _ inputs _ ( which at the same time serve also as outputs ) .",
    "a coherent superposition of photons entering the multiport is transformed into another coherent superposition of photons outgoing from the multiport .",
    "the multiports are the vertices of a graph @xmath3 , and the optical paths are its edges .    the photon travelling between multiports @xmath5 is denoted @xmath6 . the hilbert space on which the state of the photon is defined is spanned by vectors @xmath7 and",
    "can be decomposed into direct sum of hilbert subspaces @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "that is , the base of @xmath10 are the states of photon ingoing into multiport at @xmath11 . for convenience",
    "we introduce the hilbert subspace spanned by the states of photon outgoing from the vertex at @xmath11 : @xmath12    the evolution operator of states in @xmath13 is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is isometry @xmath16 ( onto , hence linear , hence unitary ) . since the subspaces are orthogonal , @xmath17 is unitary .    the concrete realization of unitary operator @xmath15 reflects the fact that the multiport partially reflects and partially transmits the ingoing photon .",
    "denoting the reflection and transmission coefficients respectively @xmath18 and @xmath19 we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 for @xmath17 to be unitary , these coefficients must satisfy the relations @xcite @xmath22 the operator @xmath15 ( for any @xmath11 ) has in the natural basis the matrix the form @xmath23 .",
    "the relations ( [ eq : cond_rt ] ) may be satisfied by setting by using the grover coefficients @xmath24 , see @xcite .",
    "the pseudo - eigensystem of any such @xmath15 can be readily computed ( `` pseudo '' means that we set an isomorphism between @xmath10 and @xmath25 s.t .",
    "@xmath26 ) . since @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the complete superposition over the basis of the domain of @xmath15 , which we denote @xmath29 ) , the eigenvectors are @xmath28 ( with pseudo - eigenvalue 1 ) and linearly independent ( but not orthogonal ) set @xmath30 ( with @xmath31-degenerate pseudo - eigenvalue -1 ) . making the direct sum of these eigenvectors gives us a pseudo - eigensystem of @xmath17 , with pseudo - eigenvalues @xmath32 .",
    "there are many other choices of the reflection and the transmission coefficients , one set of them is the following ( we will use it when necessary ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "if we set @xmath36 , then the reflection amplitude goes to @xmath37 .",
    "obviously , for large dimensions , almost all of photons will be reflected . the multiports with these coefficients",
    "will be called _ symmetric _ multiports .",
    "we will later compare both sets of coefficients with respect to their mixing properties .",
    "from now on we will be dealing with the multiports arranged into the form of the @xmath38 dimensional hypercube .",
    "the edges of the hypercube will form two - way optical paths .",

    "@xmath42 we set the scalar product @xmath43 ( mod 2 ) .",
    "the norm @xmath44 is the hamming weight ( the number of 1s in @xmath11 ) .",
    "the set @xmath45 is called the _ layer _ of the hypercube .",
    "obviously @xmath40=\\ell_1 $ ] .    for simplicity",
    ", we will denote the basis states of @xmath13 for the @xmath38-hypercube @xmath6 like @xmath46 where @xmath11 is the vertex and @xmath47 is the generator s.t . @xmath48 .",
    "the hypercube may be broken up in individual layers @xmath49 , i.e.  sets of vertices with equal hamming weight .",
    "there is a special class of vectors from @xmath13 , which is closed w.r.t @xmath17 and whose members may be described by fewer coefficients , thus simplifying the evolution equations .",
    "namely , these are the vectors @xmath50 s.t .",
    "@xmath51 is the same for all @xmath52 and for all @xmath53 . under this assumption ,",
    "the vectors are specified by coefficients @xmath54 where @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the reduced equations for evolution of the coefficients @xmath57 are given from the assumptions that each vertex from @xmath49 has a fixed number of edges which connect it to the previous and next layer ( with hamming weight having @xmath58 ) .",
    "we note that a vertex @xmath52 is connected with @xmath59 edges from previous layer and with @xmath60 edges with next layer .",
    "since the coefficients assigned to the projection @xmath50 to a given layer are fixed , we get the recursive relations : @xmath61\\psi_{w+1,-}\\\\      ( u\\psi)_{w,-}&=t(d - w)\\psi_{w+1,-}+[t(w-1)+r]\\psi_{w-1,+}\\\\    \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath62 these equations still hold wherever it makes sense , i.e.  for @xmath63 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath64 are neglected as long as they are multiplied by zero in the equation .",
    "the evolution which is governed by these equations is called the symmetric sqrw .",
    "if the initial state is @xmath65 , then we immediately obtain the expression for the hitting amplitude @xmath66\\;(d-1)!\\;\\frac{t^{d-1}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\ ] ] using the stirling approximation @xmath67 we can express for large @xmath38 the above equation as @xmath68 .",
    "we see that the hitting amplitude drops exponentially with @xmath38 .",
    "classically , the probability that we are at a given vertex from @xmath49 , is @xmath69 , for which holds @xmath70 . from this",
    "we get the hitting probability @xmath71 . by simple means",
    "we show that quantum and classical probabilities to get from the vertex @xmath72 to vertex @xmath73 in @xmath38 steps are @xmath74 the classical and quantum hitting probabilities are related like @xmath75 the ratio @xmath76 related to the dimension of the hypercube is given on the figure fig.[fig : ratio ] .    the whole model can be used to simulate coined quantum random walk on the segment of line with coin dependent on the position .",
    "the state of the coin is described by vector @xmath77,w=0,\\dots , d$ ] and is updated at each step with update rules ( [ eq : alphas ] ) .",
    "we might be troubled by the fact that the update rule is not unitary .",
    "but we need the unitarity only to conserve the inner product @xmath78 .",
    "actually , the inner product @xmath79 is conserved .",
    "though we have simplified the problem by the assumption of symmetric initial values , we are still far from its explicit solution .",
    "the solution would rely on the path integration along different paths by which two sites can be connected in a presupposed number of steps .",
    "each path would be assigned a complex amplitude ( basically some product of @xmath80 ) , and by adding all the relevant paths together , we would get the amplitude distribution over the hypercube .",
    "this normally gives us enormous combinatorial expressions , which are difficult to interpret .",
    "since the sqrw on the hypercube with symmetric initial states is equivalent with one - dimensional ( quantum ) random walk on the finite sequence of layers @xmath49 , we may explore the probability distribution @xmath81 over the layers for an initial state @xmath82 , where @xmath81 is the expectation value of the operator @xmath83 i.e.  @xmath84 .",
    "we simulate the evolution of @xmath81 ; see fig.[fig : probdist ] .",
    "we see that the sqrw on the hypercube is effectively isomorphic to a dynamics of a resonator : we start with one excited site , and the excitation propagates as a gaussian packet along the resonator . as the packet hits the boundary , the corresponding site is excited , and the packet is reflected in the opposite direction .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : probdist ] we see that the hypercube acts as a resonator when it comes to the evolution of the probability distribution over the layers .",
    "we have performed detailed simulations for the symmetric sqrw with initial conditions such that either only the coefficients @xmath85 are non - zero , or @xmath86 .",
    "there are two choices of the multiports : the grover and symmetric multiports .",
    "we make the simulations for both of them , and for both initial conditions ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : probdist2][fig : probdist3 g ] ) .",
    "we see the periodicity of the evolution : another feature akin to the resonant behavior .",
    "note that the grover multiport has much better mixing properties than the symmetric multiport , owing to the fact that it is more distant from the unity .",
    "in ref .  @xcite a model of 2-d hypercube with semi - infinite tails attached to the vertices with hamming weights 0 and 2 has been studied .",
    "each tail has been supposed to be a 1-d lattice with perfectly transmitting multiports .",
    "along one tail , a photon enters the hypercube , and emerges on the other side .",
    "it is possible to calculate explicitly the transmission coefficient of the whole structure . in the present section we will study analogous problem for an arbitrary - dimensional hypercube .",
    "we will utilize some symmetry assumptions , which let us perform the calculation ( or at least the simulation ) for arbitrary higher dimensions .",
    "the scheme we consider is shown on the figure [ fig : potential ] .",
    "now everything is as before , except that the multiports at the vertices with hamming weight @xmath87 and @xmath38 have reflection / transmission coefficients @xmath88 .",
    "the multiports outside the hypercube are perfectly transmitting .",
    "the initial state is a photon travelling between vertex @xmath89 to vertex @xmath72 from the hypercube .",
    "the state of the whole system is described by complex numbers @xmath90 which represent the amplitude that the photon travels from a vertex @xmath52 and is directed to the next or previous layer @xmath91 .",
    "now we let @xmath59 running through @xmath92 .",
    "the resulting relations are : @xmath93\\psi_{1,-}\\\\      ( u\\psi)_{0,-}&=\\tilde{r}\\psi_{-1,+}+d\\tilde{t}\\psi_{1,-}\\\\      ( u\\psi)_{d,+}&=d\\tilde{t}\\psi_{d-1,+}\\\\      ( u\\psi)_{d,-}&=[(d-1)\\tilde{t}+\\tilde{r}]\\psi_{d-1,+}\\\\      ( u\\psi)_{w,+}&=tw\\psi_{w-1,+}+[r+(d - w-1)t]\\psi_{w+1,-}\\\\      ( u\\psi)_{w,-}&=t(d - w)\\psi_{w+1,-}+[t(w-1)+r]\\psi_{w-1,+ }    \\end{split}\\ ] ]    we begin with the particle in the state @xmath94 , i.e.  a particle localized at the vertex just left of the hypercube on the tail , and pointing to the right ( see fig.[fig : potential ] ) .",
    "we have simulated the probability that a particle incoming from the left will be absorbed by the detector after @xmath95 steps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : probdist_g ] ) .",
    "this means that the system evolves for @xmath95 steps , and then a projection on the basis @xmath96 is made .",
    "the result shows periodic beats of the probability of absorption of the photon by the detector .",
    "when we impose a symmetry condition on initial states the whole problem becomes linear in the dimension of the hypercube ( normally its complexity is exponential in @xmath38 ) .",
    "but we also may be interested in the behavior appears as a result of phase differences in the components of the initial state . given the @xmath38-hypercube with semi - infinite tails attached to the vertices @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and the initial state @xmath99 now the amplitude of @xmath100 to project on @xmath101 is given by the sum of amplitudes to traverse from @xmath97 to @xmath98 in @xmath38 steps , which is @xmath102 .",
    "for initial state to be a concrete @xmath103 we have @xmath104 such paths .",
    "the situation is analogous for all @xmath105 , with each initial direction @xmath105 contributing the factor @xmath106 to the amplitude .",
    "the overall amplitude is @xmath107 the probability of detecting the particle at the state @xmath101 depends only on @xmath108 . in this sense",
    "the hypercube with tails attached behaves like mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "until now we havent discussed the question whether it is feasible to implement the sqrw . to build a whole network of multiports",
    "we need exponentially growing resources ( the number of vertices grows exponentially ) . however , to encode the states we need only @xmath109 qubits .",
    "so we can ask a question : is it possible to build a network of quantum gates operating on the qubit register of this size ? this is most easily done only on the hypercube without the semi - infinite tails attached ; however , it is also possible to implement this scheme , by adding some overhead of gates to the network .",

    "in this section we will address a question whether it is possible to use the sqrw for a database search , or a similar task ? to answer this question , we need to formulate what a quantum database is and how we can move around its entries using the sqrw .",
