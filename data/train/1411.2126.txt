    "it has been proposed long ago ( for recent reviews see  @xcite ) that the non - trivial dynamics due to the attractive interaction of pions with quarks ( or nucleons ) allows for the existence of non - uniform phases in the low temperature and high chemical potential regime of the qcd phase diagram . as the sign problem affects lattice qcd at non - zero baryon density , the use of alternative approaches such as low energy models of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl )  @xcite type , became a useful exploratory tool in the studies of strongly interacting matter .    in this",
    "talk we outline some results reported in detail in @xcite , pertaining to the study of the njl model with the t hooft determinant @xcite applied to the case where the light quark chiral condensates assume the shape of the chiral wave .",
    "we work at zero temperature and in the chiral limit for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sector , while the @xmath2 quark has a non - vanishing current mass .",
    "the chiral wave _ ansatz _ proposed in @xcite , with the corresponding quark orbitals and energy levels , forms a self consistent solution of the euler - lagrange equations of the model in the chiral limit .",
    "they have the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pauli matrix acting in the isospin space , @xmath5 is the quark dynamical mass , @xmath6 denotes the momentum of the quark , and @xmath7 is the wave vector of the condensate modulation .",
    "we choose the @xmath8-axis to coincide with @xmath7 ( note that the @xmath9 branch has a lower energy than @xmath10 ) . for the @xmath2 quark a uniform condensate background is considered .    the application of techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite yields the thermodynamic potential of the model in the mean field approximation as @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are twice the quark condensates .",
    "the integrals @xmath14 stem from the fermionic path integral over the quark bilinears which appear after bosonization , while @xmath15 corresponds to the stationary phase contribution to the integration over the auxiliary bosonic fields .",
    "the njl coupling strength is @xmath16 , while @xmath17 is the ozi - violating t hooft determinant coupling . from the value evaluated at the dynamical masses",
    "@xmath5 , a subtraction of its value evaluated at @xmath18 is made @xcite ( denoted by the @xmath19 symbol in eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) ) .",
    "we use a regularized kernel corresponding to two pauli - villars subtractions in the integrand @xcite , namely @xmath20 .",
    "the dirac and fermi sea contributions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , can be written explicitly as @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 notation refers to the subtraction of the same quantity evaluated for @xmath18 and @xmath26 , which is done to set the zero of the potential at a uniform gas of massless quarks .",
    "the superscript @xmath27 in the definition of @xmath28 refers to the energy branch , whereas the subscript refers to the sign in front of the chemical potential in the exponent .",
    "the @xmath29 term is needed for thermodynamic consistency @xcite .",
    "the minimization of the @xmath30 with respect to @xmath5 and @xmath31 has to be done self - consistently with the resolution of the following stationary phase equations ( where @xmath32 stands for the current masses of the quarks ) : @xmath33",
    "in our study we chose the parameters to reproduce a reasonable value for the vacuum dynamical mass of the light quarks ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the current masses were set to @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the remaining three parameters of the model ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath37 ) can then reduced to two : the t hooft coupling strength , @xmath17 , and the dimensionless curvature , @xmath38 . in the chiral limit",
    "@xmath39 is the critical value above which dynamical chiral symmetry breaking occurs as a crossover for @xmath40 and as a first order transition for higher values .    with no ozi - violating term ,",
    "the light and strange sectors are decoupled : two independent first order transitions occur for the light and strange sector , with the latter shifted to higher @xmath41 due to the current @xmath2-quark mass ( both occur at values of @xmath41 close to the vacuum dynamical mass @xmath42 ) . at high enough @xmath41 ,",
    "the energetically favourable solution is always a modulated one , with a non - vanishing @xmath31  the non - uniform phase develops .",
    "asymptotically , this solution goes to @xmath43 and becomes degenerate with the trivial one . above @xmath44 ,",
    "a window for energetically favourable finite-@xmath31 solutions appears in the vicinity of the first - order transition encompassing it ; the transition is not to a vanishing condensate , but @xmath45 .",

    "there are therefore three intervals of @xmath41 where an energetically favourable finite-@xmath31 solution exists .",
    "they are delimited by two first order transitions and three - crossovers ( the crossovers correspond to the disappearance / emergence of a non - vanishing @xmath47 ) .",
    "the two first order transitions occur slightly below ( for the one taking place near @xmath55 ) and slightly above ( near @xmath56 ) , thus excluding the occurrence of the @xmath26 transitions .",
