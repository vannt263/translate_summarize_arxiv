    "a first quick preliminary answer to define an image in the digital era is to say that an image is merely a _",
    "picture_. a digital picture is represented by a _ grid of pixels _",
    "@xmath0 , where at each position @xmath1 of the grid , a picture element ( _ pixel _ = picture x element ) stores a color rgb triplet : @xmath2 .",
    "the dimension of the image is the number of lines @xmath3 times its number of columns @xmath4 times the number of color channels .",
    "each _ color channel _ of a pixel stores an integer value , usually between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( coded in binary by @xmath7 bits ) , but there exists also high - resolution color images with @xmath8-bit coded values or even more . indeed , the light sensors in the cameras convert the aggregated amount of light received during a time lapse ( the exposure time ) in an electrical response by photodiodes .",
    "these electrical signals are then discretized to form a digital photo . for uncompressed photograph images ,",
    "the size of such a raw image is very large because it requires @xmath9 bits to store and manipulate .",
    "the most popular formats for image compression are the tiff and png standards .",
    "these formats get good compression ratio for _ synthetic pictures _ ( created by a drawing program ) but are not very effective for natural images : the _ photo pictures _ !",
    "photo images of a natural scene captured by sensors under slight noise condition are almost indistinguishable perceptually by the human eye .",
    "it is therefore better to store images by compressing ( with a small but controlled loss ) : this is precisely the objective of the jpeg standard .",
    "[ [ images - are - regularly - distributed - spatio - temporal - data - obtained - by - raw - signal - reconstruction ] ] images are regularly distributed spatio - temporal data obtained by raw signal reconstruction ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    to reduce costs or to miniaturize digital consumer cameras , industrial companies do not use three sensors ( one for each rgb channel ) but rather a single sensor which is coated with a bayer filter . the color image is then reconstructed through a process called demosaicing ( see figure  [ fig : bayer ] ) .",
    "so even your selfies taken with mobile phones are actually _ reconstructed images _ !",
    "an image can be interpreted as a discrete signal : a discrete function sampled at regular positions of the pixels of the continuous density function which measures the amount of light received at a point on the sensor surface .",
