    "based on carma observations of hcn , hnc , and  toward the @xmath0=3.91 quasar , evidence is consolidating that the dense , star - forming molecular gas in this source is substantially enhanced in brightness by ir pumping ( on top of gravitational magnification of the source ) .",
    "the unusual , hundreds of parsec scale , warm gas and dust in this source appears to harbor a strong ir radiation field that efficiently pumps the high-@xmath6 transitions of hcn , hnc , and hco@xmath1 at rates well beyond those achieved by collisional excitation alone . at least in the case of hcn",
    ", this leads to moderately optically thick emission , which appears as ` super - thermal ' between @xmath6=5@xmath74 and 6@xmath75 ( due to a combination of high excitation and rising optical depth ) .",
    "these findings are consistent with the picture that the bulk of the gas and dust in this source is situated in a compact , nuclear starburst , where both the highly active galactic nucleus and star formation contribute to the heating .    even though  is known to be an extreme system , radiative excitation of dense molecular gas tracers may also play a significant role in other high redshift galaxies , like it does in nearby infrared - luminous galaxies ( e.g. , aalto et al.@xcite ) .",
    "this issue becomes increasingly important for the interpretation of observations of higher-@xmath6 ( @xmath69 ) transitions of dense gas tracers like hcn , hco@xmath1 and hnc , which are redshifted into the millimeter observing windows at high @xmath0 , and thus will be primarily targeted toward galaxies in the early universe by future facilities such as the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",

    "the observations presented here were taken over the course of four ( hcn & hco@xmath1)/six ( hnc ) months .",
    "it thus is necessary to correct the flux scale of individual tracks for the intrinsic variability of the phase calibrator . given the relatively large number of tracks ( 14/23 ) , this leads to a substantially improved flux calibration relative to the sparsely sampled , internal look - up table of miriad .",
    "figure [ f6 ] shows the variability of j0818 + 423 , the phase calibrator , bootstrapped relative to mars , uranus and 3c84 ( _ top panel _ ) , measured over the first band in the lsb at @xmath15104.6/105.3ghz . for illustration ,",
    "a fit to the data is shown .",
    "fluxes for tracks that were observed without a primary calibrator were estimated based on a weighted average of those of tracks that are adjacent in time .",
    "as 3c84 is a millimeter - variable source itself , the _ bottom _ panel shows its variability over the same time range in which this project was observed . within the calibration errors , the phase calibrator shows a clear excess variability over that of 3c84 in the 2009 measurements ( data points at ( jd2454500)@xmath65332 ) . also , the scatter of values in the 2009 measurements bootstrapped relative to the mars planetary model is substantially larger than that in 2008 ( typically observed under comparable weather conditions ) .",
    "together with the fact that the fluxes bootstrapped relative to 3c84 agree well with those bootstrapped relative to planet models , this suggests that j0818 + 423 shows significant intrinsic flux variations over the observed time range .",
    "thus , we obtain the best calibration by using and interpolating the individually bootstrapped fluxes for each track , rather than using an averaged value for j0818 + 423 .",
    "we conservatively estimate that this flux calibration leads to an overall accuracy of @xmath1515% .",
