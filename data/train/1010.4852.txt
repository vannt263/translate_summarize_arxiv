    "recent developments in the field of ultracold atom gases provide a new research arena in the physics of quantum fluids : by using feshbach resonances of ultracold fermi atoms , one can study the crossover from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) phase to a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of molecules @xcite . in the current research frontier ,",
    "superfluidity of ultracold fermi gases in optical lattices is very intriguing problem , which has interesting connections with similar issues in solid state physics , nuclear physics , and astrophysics .",
    "the critical velocity of superflow due to energetic instability is one of the most important properties of superfluids , which has been pioneered by landau @xcite .",
    "if the velocity of superflow exceeds some critical value , the kinetic energy of the superfluid can be dissipated by creating excitations @xcite . in uniform superfluid fermi gases in the bcs - bec crossover , excitations which cause the energetic instability are of two types : fermionic pair - breaking excitations in the bcs regime and long - wavelength phonon excitations in the bec regime @xcite . in the unitary regime",

    "as a main result , we find that , when the lattice height is comparable to or much larger than the fermi energy , the periodic potential reduces the effect of pair - breaking excitations .",
    "this is due to the periodic structure of the quasiparticle energy spectrum in the brillouin zone and the formation of the bound molecules induced by the lattice .",

    "we understand this fact as due to the formation of bosonic molecules induced by the external periodic potential .",
    "this process is indeed expected to become significant when the lattice is strong @xcite .      before presenting the numerical results for the critical velocity ,",
    "let us discuss the conditions upon which the periodic potential can produce significant effects on the behavior of long - wavelength phonons and pair - breaking excitations .",

    "the sufficient condition for pair - breaking excitations to be affected by the periodic potential due to the formation of bound molecules is @xmath94 .",
    "this condition can be satisfied either by decreasing @xmath63 or by increasing @xmath22 . when @xmath95 , the critical velocity for pair - breaking excitations is also affected by a peculiar band structure of the quasi - particle spectrum .",

    "in particular , in the bcs regime ( negative @xmath64 ) this critical velocity is strongly reduced compared to the one in a uniform gas ( see , e.g. , fig .  8 in ref .",
    "this is a peculiar effect of the lattice .",
    "however , for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : vc](a ) , the actual critical velocity in the bcs regime is still given by fermionic pair - breaking excitations ( filled squares ) .",
    "the latter are almost unaffected by the lattice and therefore , the overall behavior of the critical velocity in the crossover is qualitatively similar to that of a uniform gas , already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite : in the bcs regime , @xmath55 increases when approaching unitarity ( @xmath96 ) , because the intra - pair attraction becomes stronger and thus the amplitude of the gap parameter increases ; in the opposite bec regime ( @xmath97 ) , the critical velocity is given by long - wavelength phonons and an increase of the inter - pair repulsion leads to a larger sound speed and , again , a critical velocity @xmath55 increases towards unitarity . as a consequence , @xmath55 takes a maximum value at @xmath98 .    when the recoil energy is comparable to the fermi energy , the periodic potential causes qualitative changes in the results of the critical velocity . for @xmath73 [ fig .",

    "therefore , the reduction of the minimum value of @xmath3 with increasing @xmath38 is relatively small for @xmath73 and this is why we find that @xmath55 is determined by phononic instead of fermionic excitations in this case .    for smaller density ( @xmath75 ) , we observe a significant increase of @xmath55 in the whole crossover [ fig .",

    ", we already showed that , in a unitary fermi superfluid with @xmath88 , the phononic critical velocity is almost unaffected by the lattice , if @xmath89 , and remains close to the speed of sound of a uniform gas with the same density @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that phonons always have wavelength larger than the healing length of the superfluid , which is the order of @xmath106 or greater .",
    "when @xmath88 , the healing length becomes much larger than the lattice spacing @xmath107 , and this makes the phonons insensitive to the lattice itself . in the present work",
    ", we find that the same is true even away from unitarity , leading to a larger critical velocity in the whole crossover [ empty circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : vc](c ) ] . the critical velocity due to pair - breaking excitations ( filled squares )",
    "is also increased because a lattice strength @xmath92 much larger than the fermi energy gives a stronger attraction between paired atoms .    in fig .",

    "a systematic analysis as a function of @xmath22 , which would be natural from the experimental viewpoint , is computationally very demanding and is beyond the scopes of this work .",
    "the choice of @xmath26 is not accidental , however .",

    "the reason why a strong lattice prevents the pair - breaking processes can be understood by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : qp_energy2 ] , where we show the quasiparticle energy spectra at various values of @xmath38 in the case of @xmath111 , @xmath75 ( i.e. , @xmath112 ) , and @xmath65 .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath80 shows a quadratic dependence of @xmath32 with a positive curvature around @xmath113 and there are no minima at @xmath114 .",

    "first , we note that the minimum value of @xmath83 at @xmath115 is smaller than , but still comparable to the value of @xmath84 in the uniform case , suggesting that the system is indeed in the superfluid phase .",
    "more importantly , one sees a large enhancement of @xmath83 , near @xmath116 , compared to the uniform system , which shows the formation of bosonic bound molecules .",
    "a consequence of this lattice induced molecular formation is that the energetic instability due to pair - breaking excitations is suppressed and does not occur at any values of @xmath38 .",
    "for the same parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : qp_energy2 ] , the energetic instability due to long - wavelength phonons instead occurs at @xmath117 and the corresponding critical velocity at @xmath65 is @xmath118 .",
    "we also find @xmath119 at unitarity and @xmath120 at @xmath81 .",
    "this means that , in the whole crossover , the critical velocity at @xmath111 is largely reduced compared to the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : vc](c ) for @xmath26 and does not exhibit a maximum anymore .",

    "( 3 ) of ref .  @xcite together with @xmath146 @xcite and the above parameters , we estimate @xmath147  @xmath148 with @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the speed of light .      here , just to give an order of estimate , we shall ignore a quantitatively significant correction by the effective range @xmath151  fm @xcite , which is comparable to the interparticle separation between neutrons ."

    "<S> we study the effects of an external periodic potential on the critical velocity of a superfluid fermi gas in the crossover between the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) phase and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically solve the bogoliubov - de gennes equations to model a three - dimensional ( 3d ) gas of ultracold atoms in the superfluid phase flowing through a 1d optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when the recoil energy is comparable to the fermi energy , the presence of the periodic potential reduces the effect of pair - breaking excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is a consequence of the peculiar band structure of the quasiparticle energy spectrum in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> when the lattice height is much larger than the fermi energy , the periodic potential makes pairs of atoms to be strongly bound even in the bcs regime and pair - breaking excitations are further suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found that when the recoil energy is comparable to or larger than the fermi energy , the critical velocity due to long - wavelength phonon excitations shows a non - monotonic behavior along the bcs - bec crossover . </S>"
