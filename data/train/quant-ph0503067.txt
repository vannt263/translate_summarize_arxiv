    "quantum computation currently attracts a lot of attention since it is expected to solve some of computationally hard problems for a conventional digital computer  @xcite .",

    "a liquid - state nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) quantum computer is regarded as most successful .",
    "early experiments demonstrated quantum teleportation  @xcite , quantum search algorithm  @xcite , quantum error correction  @xcite , and simulation of a quantum mechanical system  @xcite . undoubtedly , demonstration of shor s factorization algorithm  @xcite is one of the most remarkable achievements in nmr quantum computation .",
    "although the number of admissible qubits in a liquid - state nmr quantum computer is suspected to be limited up to about ten due to poor spin polarization at a room temperature , a liquid - state nmr quantum computer is one of few quantum computers that are capable of running nontrivial quantum algorithms thanks to well established nmr technology .",
    "since the number of qubits within heteronucleus spins is practically limited to two or three , the use of homonucleus spins is inevitable if we try to equip an nmr with a large number of qubits .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that liquid - state nmr of homonucleus molecules is still poorly understood and literature dealing with this subject often lacks solid ground . although the product operator formalism @xcite has been extensively employed to implement quantum algorithms with an nmr quantum computer , people overlooked significance of the genuine hamiltonian . actually there is a subtle difference between the conventionally used hamiltonian and the proper hamiltonian for homonucleus spins .",
    "it is , therefore , urgently required to establish theoretical foundation underlying a liquid - state nmr quantum computer with homonucleus molecules .",
    "suppose we would like to implement a quantum algorithm whose unitary matrix representation is @xmath1 .",
    "if the hamiltonian @xmath2 depends on the control parameters , which we write collectively as @xmath3 , the time evolution operator is given by @xmath4 = { \\mathcal t } \\exp\\left[-i          \\int_0^t h(\\gamma(t ) ) dt\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath5 stands for the time - ordering product .",

    "recently , numerical scheme to find the optimal control has been worked out for fictitious josephson junction qubits , where polygonal paths in the parameter space has been utilized  @xcite . for time - optimal control of an nmr quantum computer ,",
    "another method employing the cartan decomposition of su(@xmath9 ) has been proposed  @xcite and has been demonstrated experimentally with a two - qubit heteronucleus molecule  @xcite .",
    "we note that exact optimal control has been found for holonomic quantum computation in an idealized situation  @xcite .",
    "this paper has three aims : ( 1 ) to provide the theoretical foundation for an nmr quantum computer with homonucleus molecules , ( 2 ) to show that any pulse sequence designed for heteronucleus molecules can be translated into that for homonucleus molecules , and ( 3 ) to demonstrate experimentally that our hamiltonian accurately describes the dynamics of the spins . for these purposes ,",
    "we carefully examine the hamiltonians for nmr spin dynamics .",

    "ii we study hamiltonians of homonucleus as well as heteronucleus molecules .",

    "we execute the deutsch - jozsa algorithm , execute the pulse sequence for pseudo - pure state preparation , and verify the robustness of two - qubit entangling operations . as an application of the correct form of the hamiltonian",
    "we implement field inhomogeneity compensation using a pair of @xmath0-pulses in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "in this section , we write down the hamiltonian of spin dynamics in the laboratory frame and transform it to the one in a rotating frame .",
