    "molecular spectroscopy is currently seeing a lot of development in the terahertz or sub - millimeter wave domain @xcite .",
    "this frequency range of 0.3 to 10thz started to be explored about thirty years ago @xcite , but it has been notoriously difficult to provide sources and detectors for this part of the electromagnetic spectrum",
    ". the terahertz range encompasses transitions between rotational states in small molecules such as water or ammonia and between levels of large - amplitude vibrational motion in larger molecules and weakly - bound clusters @xcite .",
    "a notable example is the vibration - rotation - tunneling transitions in hydrogen - bonded water clusters @xcite .",
    "the rotational resolution provides access to detailed information on geometrical structures and spin interactions , which allows for precise comparisons with ab initio structure calculations @xcite .",
    "the terahertz domain is not only important for earth - based spectroscopy and imaging @xcite , but also to explore the interstellar medium , in particular the distribution of molecules and ions in cold interstellar and circumstellar molecular clouds @xcite . with the advent of far - infrared observatories ( herschel , sofia , alma )",
    "this domain has become available for astronomical observations @xcite . provided laboratory data exists , a wealth of information on molecules of interstellar importance is obtained , such as on the molecular ions oh@xmath2 , oh@xmath3 , oh@xmath4 , arh@xmath2 , and h@xmath5d@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "laboratory data in the microwave regime have lead to the detection of the interstellar anions c@xmath6h@xmath1 , c@xmath7h@xmath1 , c@xmath8h@xmath1 , cn@xmath1 , c@xmath9n@xmath1 , and theoretical calculations allowed for the identification of c@xmath10n@xmath1 @xcite",
    ". an unsuccessful search has been performed for c@xmath9h@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "new technologies are being developed to improve terahertz sources , their resolution , precision , tunability , and intensity , as well as the sensitivity for their detection .",
    "today , the major approaches for continuous - wave generation with narrow linewidth and tunability are quantum cascade lasers @xcite , frequency multiplication of microwaves @xcite , and difference frequency generation of near - infrared lasers @xcite . the latter approach is also the key to terahertz time - domain spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "in addition , improvements in terahertz detection sensitivity are being explored , e.  g.  cavity enhancement techniques @xcite , in order to provide new means for the spectroscopy of transient species or for trace gas detection . in the microwave regime , an important advancement in detection",
    "signal - to - noise has been achieved with the chirped - pulse technique @xcite , which is being extended towards the terahertz regime @xcite .",
    "terahertz spectroscopy for molecular ions remains to be a major challenge , because number densities in experiments are orders of magnitude lower than for neutral species . in plasma discharges",
    "direct terahertz absorption spectroscopy has been achieved for a selection of small molecular ions : using diode lasers high lying rotational states of arh@xmath2 , neh@xmath2 , heh@xmath2 , oh@xmath2 , h@xmath5o@xmath2 , and oh@xmath1 have been studied many years ago @xcite . during the following years , rotational states in the frequency regime below 2thz have been resolved for several small molecular cations , including sh@xmath2 @xcite , arh@xmath4 @xcite , the hydronium ion h@xmath9o@xmath2 @xcite , hoco@xmath2 @xcite and hcnh@xmath2 @xcite and their isotopomers , and c@xmath5h@xmath4 @xcite .",

    "ion traps spectroscopy of mass - selected molecular ions has been developed using state - resolved laser - induced reactions @xcite , photofragmentation @xcite and - more recently - laser - induced inhibition of cluster growth @xcite as probing schemes , all of which gain their sensitivity from the detection of the created or remaining number of ions .",
    "up to now this has made it possible to study pure rotational transitions in the terahertz for h@xmath5d@xmath2 , hd@xmath2 , and oh@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "here we present a method to measure rotational transitions of molecular anions in the terahertz domain by sequential two - photon absorption .",
    "terahertz absorption on bound - bound transitions is followed by visible absorption on a bound - free transition that leads to photodetachment of the excess electron .",

    "note , however , that already with the present precision the key benefit of our approach is that a small sample of a few ions , which can be mass - selected prior to the experiment , is sufficient and that reactive collisions do not play a role in the cryogenic helium buffer gas environment .    from the measured depletion signals the intensity of the terahertz radiation in the trap can be estimated .",
    "for this purpose the rate equation system for the two lowest rotational states @xmath30 and @xmath31 , coupled by the terahertz radiation , the photodetachment losses of the upper state and the known inelastic collisions @xcite has been solved . for the observed depletion of about 25% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3-spectra ] ( a ) ) a terahertz excitation rate of about 5 - 10/s has been extracted for the fundamental transition . with the dipole matrix element for this transition @xcite",
    ", this rate implies a terahertz power irradiating the ion cloud of about 20 - 40nw near 600ghz . this power is more than a factor of ten weaker than the estimated power delivered by the terahertz photomixer , predominantly because of the imperfect transmission of the radiation , with a wavelength of 0.5 mm , into the ion trap through its 6.6 mm inner diameter endcap electrodes .",
    "these losses will be reduced with an optimized ion trap configuration that is based on a larger separation between the rf rods to allow passing the terahertz radiation radially into the ion trap .",

    "an interesting system to explore is the cluster h@xmath9o@xmath32 , the smallest deprotonated water cluster .",
    "its structure is characterized by a central proton , which is delocalized between two classical minimum energy structures in the born - oppenheimer potential energy surface . the photodetachment cross section of this system near threshold shows a strong dependence on the trap temperature @xcite , which is indicative for its sensitivity to the population of the rotational and low - lying vibrational states .",
    "rotationally - resolved spectra will provide new and detailed information on the non - classical ground state of this cluster anion .",
    "spectroscopy in this frequency range is also needed to search for molecular line emission from interstellar molecular clouds and to help understand the chemical networks that lead to the formation of these molecules . currently , the cation and neutral states of hydroxyl have been observed @xcite , but not the oh@xmath1 and od@xmath1 anions .",
    "nitrogen hydrides , the nh@xmath2 and nh@xmath32 ions , have been searched for and a tentative assignment of the nh@xmath32 anion has been made at an offset of 141mhz , roughly within the estimated accuracy for the transition frequency @xcite . clearly , direct rotational spectroscopy is needed to improve this accuracy and clarify the tentative assignment .",
    "in general , sufficient conditions for the application of our approach to rotational spectroscopy are that photodetachment occurs by s - wave electron emission , which guarantees a high cross section near threshold , and that the franck - condon factor for the transition to the vibrational ground state of the neutral is of sufficient strength .",
    "many molecular anions , including polyatomic anions , fulfill these conditions .",
    "the frequency range of the method is limited at the low - frequency end by a sufficiently large population difference , which requires a sufficiently low temperature . with an ion temperature of 4k ,",
    "transition frequencies down to below 200ghz become accessible .",
    "the available terahertz power limits the detection sensitivity at high frequencies to about 1.5thz .",
    "we have presented a method for terahertz action spectroscopy of negatively charged molecules by two - photon detachment action spectroscopy . using a widely tunable terahertz source",
