    "we study in the following the in - medium effects of hadrons with strangeness .",
    "the paper is split in two main parts , one dealing with kaons and antikaons , the other with hyperons . in both parts ,",
    "we discuss first our basic knowledge of the underlying kaon / antikaon - nucleon , hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interaction , respectively , and how it relates to an optical potential at normal nuclear density .",
    "implications for the properties of neutron stars are discussed .",
    "then we proceed to apply the possible in - medium effects to heavy - ion collisions . in the first part about kaons and antikaons ,",
    "special emphasis will be put on the fact , that the in - medium effects probed in heavy - ion collisions are entirely different from the ones in the interior of neutron stars .",
    "this results in a reinterpretation of the subthreshold production rates of antikaons as measured at gsi . in the second part about hyperons , we focus on the possibility of forming bound states of hyperons in heavy - ion collisions at freeze - out by virtue of a highly attractive hyperon - hyperon interaction .",
    "the properties and decay patterns of these strange exotic particles are quite unique and make them well distinguishable experimentally from ordinary hadrons and nuclei .",
    "the study of kaons in dense matter has attracted much interest in recent years in particular due to its possible implications for neutron stars . for the k@xmath1 we know from the low - density theorem , that the optical potential is repulsive in matter @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ( known ) elementary k@xmath1n scattering amplitude .",
    "the low - density theorem can not be applied to the k@xmath0 , because of the appearance of inelastic channels in dense matter as k@xmath0n@xmath4 .",
    "the strong coupling to these inelastic channels , they are about 100 mev _ below _ threshold , gives rise to a large imaginary part and to a resonant state just below threshold so that the isospin zero scattering length is repulsive .",
    "this resonant state , the @xmath5 resonance , controls the in - medium properties of the k@xmath0 .",
    "there are two indications , that the optical potential for the k@xmath0 changes sign in the medium .",
    "firstly , the study of kaonic atoms reveals that a fit with a nonlinear density dependence can reduce the energy of the kaon by nearly 200 mev inside the nucleus @xcite .",
    "secondly , a coupled channel calculation for the k@xmath0 in the nuclear medium produces also an attractive potential of @xmath6 mev at @xmath7 @xcite , although it is much shallower than the one extracted from kaonic atoms . here , the @xmath5 mode is shifted up in the medium , so that the k@xmath0 feels its truly attractive potential . the implications for the properties of neutron stars can be quite drastic . ignoring the hyperon degrees of freedom , the maximum mass of a neutron star",
    "is considerably reduced @xcite .",
    "also , the minimum radius can decrease from values around 12 km to nearly 8 km @xcite .",
    "these small radii occur only for relatively large values of the k@xmath0 optical potential which are between the values quoted from kaonic atoms and coupled channel calculations . in this case",
    ", a first order phase transition occurs in the interior of the neutron star building a mixed phase of an ordinary nucleonic phase and a kaon condensed phase .",
    "the smallness of the radius of a neutron star might then signal a first order phase transition .",
    "but as we will see below , this is _ not _ a unique feature for kaon condensation inside neutron stars .",
    "heavy - ion collisions provide an important tool to pin down the possible in - medium effects for antikaons .",
    "especially , the production rates of k@xmath0 at subthreshold bombarding energies are regarded as a measure of the antikaon optical potential @xcite .",
    "now the situation in heavy - ion collisions is completely different compared to kaonic atoms or neutron stars . in the latter two cases , the antikaon optical potential is probed at zero momentum and zero temperature . in heavy - ion collisions , on the contrary , matter is in motion and antikaons are produced with a finite momentum relative to the matter rest frame .",
    "in addition , the matter is not only dense but also heated up  slope parameters of 90 mev have been extracted from the hadron spectra .",
    "so the relevant observable in heavy - ion collisions is the optical potential of the k@xmath0 at finite relative momentum and finite temperature .",
    "we studied the properties of the k@xmath0 in such an environment within a coupled channel calculation @xcite .",
    "a simple separable su(3 ) symmetric potential is used whose parameters are fixed by the shape of the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "this also gives a reasonable description of the various cross sections , although we underestimate the elastic channel and overestimate the charge exchange reaction k@xmath0p@xmath8 k@xmath9n . in the medium ,",
    "the loop integral over the intermediate states ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) is modified . in the following ,",
    "we just discuss the simplest case , when only the nucleon propagator is changed in the medium . in - medium effects for the hyperons are found to be negligible @xcite . a selfconsistent treatment of the antikaon , as done in @xcite ,",
    "would only strengthen our conclusions about the optical potential of the antikaon in heavy - ion matter .",
    "= 0.30    the temperature dependence of the k@xmath0 optical potential is shown in figure  [ fig : uopt_temp ] for different densities .",
    "one sees , that the k@xmath0 optical potential suddenly changes sign for a sufficiently large temperature . for normal nuclear density @xmath7",
    ", this happens to be at a critical temperature of @xmath13 mev .",
    "for twice normal nuclear density the critical temperature is about twice this value . in both cases ,",
    "the critical temperature stays well below the slope parameter of @xmath14 mev measured in the relevant heavy - ion experiments at gsi .",
    "note , that the value of @xmath15 is equal to the nucleon fermi energy .",
    "pauli blocking effects begin to wash out and to get ineffective at @xmath15 for providing an attractive potential for the antikaon . at large temperatures , the optical potential saturates at a positive ( repulsive ) value . here",
    ", the interaction between k@xmath0 and the nucleons can again be described by the low density theorem as the systems gets diluted by the high temperature .",
    "the repulsive potential at large temperatures is then just proportional to the repulsive scattering length times the density , as can be read off from figure  [ fig : uopt_temp ] .",
    "we found a similar but less pronounced effect , when incorporating a finite relative momentum for the k@xmath0 optical potential @xcite .",
    "for momenta relevant to subthreshold production of k@xmath0 at gsi , the optical potential turns out to be repulsive , too .",
    "we conclude at his point , that the k@xmath0 feels a much shallower if not repulsive potential in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "hence , the hitherto used argumentation that a reduced effective energy of the k@xmath0 is responsible for the enhanced subthreshold production of k@xmath0 seen at gsi should at least be reconsidered .",
    "= 0.30    there are two comments and a question in order at this point .",
    "firstly , a selfconsistent treatment of the k@xmath0 results also in much shallower optical potentials of @xmath16 to @xmath17 mev at @xmath7 even for the zero momentum , zero temperature case @xcite strengthening our conclusions made above . recently , a selfconsistent calculation has been performed by tolos et al within the bonn model , which takes into account all higher partial waves @xcite .",
    "they find a value of @xmath18 mev for the antikaon optical potential at @xmath7 , which is still lower than the @xmath19 mev of the nonrelativistic coupled channel calculation used above .",
    "secondly , the results for finite momenta have to be taken with care , as p - wave contributions might become important , which have not been included here ( see @xcite ) .",
    "again the momentum dependence is much weaker in the bonn model calculation including all partial waves @xcite than in our calculations which takes into account only the s - wave contributions .",
    "note , that the large temperature effects seen in figure  [ fig : uopt_temp ] are unaffected by these comments .",
    "so if the antikaon feels that weak attraction ( if at all ) in heavy - ion collisions , how can one explain the enhancement of k@xmath0 production rates as measured at gsi ?",
    "one possible explanation might be provided by studying the in - medium cross sections for the antikaons .",
    "indeed , the fact that the @xmath5 mode is shifted up in the medium directly relates to an tremendously enhanced imaginary scattering amplitude , i.e.  an enhanced cross section , at and above the threshold energy .",
    "we define an enhancement factor of the cross section by the ratio of the cross section at normal nuclear density over the one at zero density .",
    "the enhancement factor for the production cross section of the k@xmath0 via the hyperon - pion channels is depicted in figure  [ fig : sigma_enh ] versus the colliding energy of the k@xmath0p pair .",
    "the production cross section @xmath20 is enhanced by an order of magnitude , while the @xmath21 channel is barely affected .",
    "the reason is , that only the isospin zero amplitude , where the @xmath5 is sitting , is enhanced in the medium .",
    "the @xmath21 does not couple to isospin zero , while the @xmath22 does .",
    "this explains the difference in the enhancement factor seen in figure  [ fig : sigma_enh ] .",
    "the dominant peak structure around @xmath23 gev stems from the @xmath5 which is shifted well above threshold in the dense nuclear medium .",
    "the position of the peak depends on the density .",
    "it is noteworthy , that especially the @xmath24 production channel is enhanced at threshold .",
    "indications of this medium enhancement can be deduced from k@xmath0 absorption on nuclei @xcite . as shown in @xcite , finite momentum , finite temperature and selfconsistency effects",
    "are not as crucial for the cross sections as for the optical potential , so that an enhancement , although somehow diminished , prevails .",
    "hence , the cross section enhancement seems to be a viable tool to explain the k@xmath0 enhancement .",
    "as we will see in the following , this is not yet the full story .",
    "= 0.4      to elucidate the possible influences of in - medium potentials and in - medium cross sections , a relativistic transport model has to be asked for advice . here",
    "we use the buu transport model of @xcite .",
    "details of the included strangeness production and absorption channels as well as of the implemented kaon - nucleon interactions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the model gives a reasonable description of the pion and k@xmath1 production data .",
    "for the k@xmath0 , we implement the following three in - medium effects of our coupled channel calculations in addition to the free case . in all these cases ,",
    "effects from a finite relative momentum and finite temperature are ignored to study the maximum possible in - medium effect in our approach .",
    "firstly , an optical potential of the k@xmath0 is included which scales with density as done in all previous simulations with in - medium effects for the k@xmath0 .",
    "note , that this provides the maximal in - medium effect for the k@xmath0 optical potential which , as outlined before , is probably weakened at finite relative momentum .",
    "secondly , the in - medium cross section is taken into account .",
    "thirdly , both effects are added to the simulation .",
    "this case gives the maximum in - medium effect .",
    "let us begin by looking at the collision spectra in figure  [ fig : coll_spectra ] . an in - medium potential for the k@xmath0 increases the number of @xmath25 collisions by about a factor two as more antikaons are produced .",
    "the energy shift of the antikaon in the medium also populates the collisions spectra below the threshold energy .",
    "a modification of the cross section in the medium triples the number of @xmath26 processes .",
    "finally , the combined effects of in - medium potential and cross section enhances the collisions spectra by a factor five below @xmath27 gev .",
    "note , that a modified cross section enhances both reactions , the production as well as the absorption reactions , due to detailed balance .",
    "as the systems is close to equilibrium , the enhanced production of antikaons is nearly compensated by the increased absorption rate .",
    "= 0.35    this effect shows up also in the final production cross section ( see figure  [ fig : ekin_spectra ] ) .",
    "the medium effects for the k@xmath0 are less drastic than expected from the sizable in - medium changes of the optical potential and the cross sections .",
    "we see a maximum enhancement of about a factor of three for low momentum k@xmath0 compared to the free case which is much less than the anticipated order of magnitude enhancement from the in - medium cross section enhancement or the optical potential .",
    "interestingly , the result without in - medium effects is already close to the data points of the kaos collaboration and the inclusion of in - medium effects just puts the curve closer to the data .",
    "the ratio of produced k@xmath0 to k@xmath1 as measured by the fopi collaboration is plotted in figure  [ fig : k_ratio ] .",
    "again , one notices that the production rate of k@xmath0 is not very sensitive to in - medium effects .",
    "only the combined maximum effect of a deeply attractive optical potential of the k@xmath0 and an enhanced cross sections results in a significant deviation of the k@xmath0/k@xmath1 ratio from the one of the free case .",
    "while the free case is on top of the data points , the in - medium effects seem to overpredict the ratio slightly .",
    "the in - medium results do not differ significantly from the free case , because the system is already so close to chemical equilibrium that an acceleration of the reaction rates due to larger cross sections or reduced masses has no further influence on the final production yields .",
    "= 0.35    our results are in accord with the success of the statistical model in the canonical ensemble in describing the kaon and antikaon production data @xcite . in this model ,",
    "no in - medium effect is required to get the k@xmath0/k@xmath1 ratio , too .",
    "another hint for the success of the statistical model might be provided by the collision spectra of figure [ fig : coll_spectra ] .",
    "the in - medium cross sections enhance the number of collisions involving the k@xmath0 without changing the final number considerably , so that a purely statistical analysis becomes applicable .",
    "hence , we judge from figures  [ fig : ekin_spectra ] and [ fig : k_ratio ] that the k@xmath0 production numbers are not a very sensitive probe of possible in - medium effects of the k@xmath0 in dense matter .    in summary ,",
    "our investigations seems to indicate that one has to look for more subtle observables to pin down the possible in - medium effects for the antikaons in a less ambiguous way .",
    "one such observable might be well constituted by the k@xmath0 flow pattern .",
    "this feature of the k@xmath0 flow is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : k_flow ] . without medium modifications and even for a modified cross section , the k@xmath0 shows an antiflow .",
    "an attractive k@xmath0 optical potential makes the k@xmath0 to flow with the nucleons .",
    "we found that only an attractive potential for the k@xmath0 switches from an antiflow to a flow of the k@xmath0 .",
    "the inclusion of temperature effects will also result in an antiflow pattern .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the flow of the k@xmath0 might be better suited to extract the attractive optical potential of the k@xmath0 than the k@xmath0 production rates .",
    "in the following we discuss the properties of hyperons in dense matter .",
    "the detailed study of @xmath28-hypernuclei gives important information about the underlying nucleon-@xmath28 interaction . actually , the @xmath28 is the only hadron , besides the nucleons , where we know for sure the in - medium properties at normal nuclear matter density as it has been measured to be @xmath29 mev , contrary to e.g.  the kaons and antikaons . for the other hyperons the situation is less clear .",
    "no bound states of heavy @xmath30-hypernuclei have been found @xcite ( note that the only known @xmath30-hypernucleus @xmath31he is bound by virtue of an attractive isospin force @xcite ) .",
    "the nucleon-@xmath32 interaction as extracted from the few @xmath32-hypernuclear events is attractive and gives a potential depth of @xmath33 to @xmath34 mev at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of final state interactions of nucleons and @xmath32 indicate a somewhat smaller value of @xmath35 mev or less @xcite . the @xmath36 interaction is also found to be attractive in the available double @xmath28 hypernuclear data @xcite , even more attractive than the n@xmath28 interaction . for the other hyperon - hyperon interactions ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) nothing",
    "is known at present .",
    "nevertheless , a strongly attractive hyperon - hyperon interaction can quite strongly effect the global properties of a neutron star . a third solution to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations",
    "can be found for highly attractive hyperon - hyperon potentials , which has extremely small radii of 68 km @xcite .",
    "hence , these so called hyperstars have similar small radii as the ones obtained for kaon condensation in neutron stars .",
    "theoretically , the strength of the hyperon - hyperon interaction can not be deduced from general arguments .",
    "model calculations predict that the hyperon - hyperon interaction is so attractive in certain channels that it leads to the existence of bound systems of two hyperons .",
    "the most recent nijmegen model even suggests that states of @xmath40 and @xmath41 dibaryons might be deeply bound @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion experiments are the only terrestrial source which can possibly shed light on the issue of the baryon - baryon interactions for hyperons .",
    "dozens of hyperons can be produced in a single central heavy - ion collisions , sitting close in phase space . at freeze - out , pairs of hyperons can form and build a bound strange composite object .",
    "this strange dibaryon will then decay on the timescale of weak interactions . here , we discuss possible signals , if such a bound strange dibaryon indeed exists .",
    "the weak decay of the strange dibaryon is modelled by using weak su(3 ) symmetry for the parity - violating and parity - conserving amplitudes , whose parameters are fixed by the weak decay amplitudes of the octet hyperons @xcite .",
    "there are two possible decays for the dibaryon : mesonic like in the case of free hyperon decay and nonmesonic without emitting a meson .",
    "the latter one is only possible in the medium and has been studied experimentally by the weak decay of medium to heavy @xmath28 hypernuclei .",
    "the standard approach to the nonmesonic decay of @xmath28 hypernuclei is the meson exchange model @xcite .",
    "we extended the meson exchange model for the weak nonmesonic decay to the other hyperons taking into account only the intermediate pion and kaon exchanges @xcite .",
    "the resulting decay lengths of different strange dibaryons from these model calculations are in the range of @xmath425 cm , which are only slightly shorter than the ones for the free hyperons .      for the two-@xmath28 dibaryon",
    ", the branching ratio for the various decay channels are summarized in figure  [ fig : lala ] .",
    "the dominant decay channel for small binding energies is the free ( mesonic ) one , as the two @xmath28 s are well separated . for larger binding energies ,",
    "the dominant decay channel is @xmath43 , the same as for the h dibaryon @xcite one is looking for in experiment e896 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : xi0p ] shows the case for a bound @xmath44p dibaryon .",
    "the @xmath44p decays mainly into a @xmath28 and a proton for binding energies of only 1.5 mev and beyond .",
    "this decay can in principle be seen either in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath28 s and protons or directly by the decay topology .",
    "the decay of @xmath44p dibaryon looks like the one for a normal @xmath45 or @xmath46 hyperon , but instead of a meson a proton is leaving the first weak vertex .",
    "strange dibaryons can have quite exotic properties , as they can have negative charge while carrying a positive baryon number .",
    "there are three possible strange dibaryons which even have charge @xmath47 : the @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "interestingly , all of these have been predicted to be bound in the recent version of the nijmegen model @xcite .",
    "the first candidate has only one possible decay which is mesonic : @xmath51 . as the matrix element of the mesonic decay is practically unchanged in the medium",
    ", we immediately know that the decay length of this object is @xmath52 cm .",
    "the other two candidates have mesonic as well as nonmesonic decay channels .",
    "but in all weak decays , there is a unique prong as a track with charge @xmath47 suddenly splits up into two tracks with charge @xmath53 .",
    "such a weak decay is not possible for ordinary matter .",
    "it is in principle also sufficient to measure just the mass of an object with charge @xmath47 as the strange dibaryons are lighter than an anti - helium nucleus .",
    "the production rates of strange dibaryons have been estimated for au+au collisions at bnl s relativistic heavy ion collider using rqmd2.4 with a wavefunction coalescence @xcite .",
    "the rates vary between @xmath54 to @xmath55 per event depending on the strangeness content of the dibaryon .",
    "the rapidity distribution is rather flat , so that dibaryons are even produced at forward and backward rapidities .",
    "hence , the production rates are reasonably high to search for these exotic states in heavy - ion collisions and open the door to the hitherto unexplored hyperon world .",
