    "systematic spectral variations are clues to the nature of @xmath0 car  our most observable very massive star dangerously close to the eddington limit , and the site of a prototype `` supernova impostor '' eruption seen about 160 years ago . on several occasions between 1945 and 1990",
    "the general excitation or ionization decreased for a few months , in the stellar wind and also in slow - moving ejecta located within 1000 au of the star ( see @xcite ; and other refs .",
    "cited therein ) .",
    "prompted by a fresh example observed in 1992 , @xcite noticed that these events recur in a 5.5-year cycle which had also appeared in photometry @xcite .",
    "the next two spectroscopic events occurred near 1998.0 and 2003.5 , close to the predicted times .",
    "as noted in section 5 below , at least three rival scenarios may explain an event of this type .",
    "the star may eject a shell , possibly triggered by a hypothetical companion star in a 5.5-year orbit ; the excitation of our side of the wind may temporarily decrease when a hot secondary star moves to the far side of its orbit ; uv radiation from a hot companion may become engulfed in the primary wind near periastron ; or some mixture of these effects may occur . unfortunately no quantitative model has been developed , and one can imagine other possibilities .",
    "a strange detail , highly relevant to the discussion in this paper , is that the 5.5-year cycle probably did not exist before the 1940 s  at least not in its present form ; see section 5 below and references cited there .",
    "suitable data on these events were scarce until recently .",
    "ground - based spectroscopy of the star is seriously contaminated by diffuse ejecta located at radii 0.2  2 ; and , so far as we know , no long - term , spatially consistent ground - based observations of a broad wavelength range were attempted . the hubble space telescope ( hst )",
    "can attain the required high spatial resolution , but was used for spectroscopy of @xmath0 car on only a few occasions from 1991 to 2001  fortunately including part of the 199798 event ( see below ) .",
    "the fund of available data greatly improved during 200203 , when we obtained numerous hst observations using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) as part of a hubble treasury project to observe the 2003.5 event @xcite .    here",
    "we report a particularly striking result : h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 , the brightest observable emission lines in the stellar wind , briefly developed unusual velocity profiles which were _ quite different from their appearance during the previous event in 199798 .",
    "_ this development , combined with other circumstances noted in sections 4 and 5 below , leads us to suspect that @xmath0 car may now be passing through an unusually rapid phase in its recovery from the 19th - century great eruption .",
    "independent of this conjecture , our data show that the 5.5-year cycle is not a straightforward clocklike affair ; while the emission - line behavior reported here is essential for modeling the spectroscopic event .",
    "parallel ground - based observations of the polar - latitude spectrum reflected by the `` homunculus '' ejecta - nebula will be described in a companion paper by @xcite .",
    "in this paper the name @xmath0 car denotes only the central star and its wind , excluding ejecta at radii larger than 0.1 or about 200 au . during 19982003",
    "we observed it with the hst / stis / ccd on 21 occasions , about half of them during 2003 .",
    "table 1 lists the observation dates specifically mentioned in this paper ; for more information see http://etacar.umn.edu , and/or the hst archives at http://stsci.edu .",
    "the spectroscopic cycle has period = 2023 @xmath3 7 d @xmath4 5.54  y , based on photometry , spectroscopic variations , and x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "since the circumstellar extinction has diminished rapidly in recent years , causing a dramatic increase in the star s apparent brightness @xcite , we measure emission line profiles relative to the underlying continuum . lines and continuum all originate in the opaque stellar wind , not at the star s surface @xcite .",
    "each spectrum discussed below represents essentially a 0.1 @xmath5 0.15 spatial sample : the pixel size was about 0.05 , the slit width was about 2 ccd columns , each extraction sampled about 3 ccd rows , and the spectral resolution was roughly 40 km s@xmath6 .",
    "( here we omit some technicalities that have little effect on the main results . ) for the bright h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines we use only data with integration times less than 1 s and 20 s respectively , short enough to avoid saturation of any ccd pixels ; and we have verified that in fact none were saturated . other instrument parameters and our non - standard reduction techniques , inessential for this paper and too complex to describe briefly , can be found at http://etacar.umn.edu and will be reviewed in a series of later , more detailed papers .",
    "doppler velocities quoted below are all heliocentric .",
    "figure 1 shows how h@xmath1 , the brightest observable feature , varied during 19982003 . the conspicuous absorption near @xmath7 km",
    "s@xmath6 must occur far outside the stellar wind , since it appears in stis data across much of the inner homunculus nebula .",
    "its central wavelength varies with position , in a way that differs substantially from the net doppler shift of the star s spectrum reflected by dust in the expanding ejecta .",
    "this absorption feature fluctuates in strength and confused earlier ground - based observations ; see fig .  4 in @xcite , fig .  2 in @xcite , or fig .  4 in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately it masks part of the intrinsic line profile .    apart from the extraneous narrow absorption , during the 199798 spectroscopic event h@xmath1 resembled a conventional stellar - wind emission feature with a rounded peak , p cyg absorption around @xmath8 km s@xmath6 , and extended wings probably due to thomson scattering ( fig",
    "@xcite described a wind model that accounted for the early-1998 spectrum fairly well ; see also @xcite . by 1999 , however , p cyg absorption had almost disappeared along our line of sight to the star ( fig .",
    "meanwhile the p cyg feature remained prominent at polar latitudes , observed via reflection in the southeast homunculus lobe @xcite .",
    "most likely this difference indicates that the stellar wind between events is denser near the poles than it is at lower latitudes .",
    "if so , then @xmath0 car s photosphere , located in its wind , usually has a prolate shape ( see also @xcite )  except , perhaps , during a spectroscopic event .",
    "the line profile varied with no clear trend or pattern during 19992002 ( fig .",
    "naturally we expected h@xmath1 to resemble its early-1998 form during the 2003.5 event .",
    "1c shows that in fact it behaved quite differently .",
    "our 2003.51 and 2003.58 observations bracketed the time when 5.54 years had elapsed since the earliest stis data ; in order to simplify the figure we omit the 2003.51 profile , which closely resembled 2003.58 but was slightly higher . comparing the 2003.58 data to 1998.00 ,",
    "one finds that  + @xmath9 the line center at 2003.58 had a remarkably flat top with @xmath10 , only about half the relative height seen in 1998 .",
    "+ @xmath9 the long - wavelength wing in 2003 was about 30% lower than in 1998 .",
    "( due to the thomson scattering process , this is expected to be relatively insensitive to the viewing direction . ) + @xmath9 the short - wavelength side and the p cyg feature behaved more or less the same in 2003 as they had in 1998  except , perhaps , that p cyg absorption appeared deeper at 2003.58 than it did at 1998.00 .",
    "+ @xmath9 the total h@xmath1 equivalent width at 2003.58 was 550  , compared to 880  at 1998.00  nearly a 40% decrease .",
    "+ @xmath9 in summary , the flux temporarily decreased at doppler velocities around zero during the 2003 spectroscopic event , but not in the preceding one .    the 2003.37 and 2003.72 curves in fig .",
    "1c illustrate a more subtle trend that occurred around the time of the event .",
    "several weeks before 2003.5 the maximum flux occurred at negative doppler velocities ; then , between 2003.5 and 2003.7 , the top of the profile tilted smoothly so that afterward the maximum was on the positive - velocity side .",
    "if one were to measure the line centroid during the entire 5.5-year cycle ( somehow allowing for the extraneous absorption near @xmath7 km s@xmath6 ) , then a systematic fluctuation would appear , resembling those shown in @xcite and @xcite ; but this involves complex variations in the line shape , and does not represent a classical orbital velocity curve .",
    "( see also @xcite and other refs",
    ".  cited therein . )",
    "we shall return to this point in section 5 below .    by 2003.88",
    "the h@xmath1 profile had recovered to a more normal appearance ( fig .",
    "1d ) , strongly suggesting that the flat top was related to the spectroscopic event .",
    "we are not aware of any observation of a flat - topped h@xmath1 profile in previous direct spectroscopy of @xmath0 car , including ground - based data obtained during the weeks preceding the 1998.0 stis observations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "broad flat - topped line shapes can be seen , however , in some ground - based observations of the southeast homunculus lobe , reflecting a polar view of the wind @xcite .",
    "a line profile of this type is not , _",
    "per se , _ very surprising .",
    "it is well known that an idealized , optically thin expanding shell produces rectangular line shapes , and the `` optically thin '' proviso is not very strict ; a flat - topped profile occurs whenever the observed emission represents the vicinity of a quasi - spherical expanding surface . this situation can arise in an ejected shell , or , alternatively , near a localized abrupt gradient in ionization , excitation , or ( as an anonymous reviewer suggests ) continuum opacity .",
    "flat - topped line profiles can also result from very different configurations , e.g. from a pair of oppositely - directed polar flows viewed at an oblique angle . in this paper",
    "we do not advocate any one model in particular .",
    "rather , we wish to emphasize a basic puzzle and surprise : _ flat - topped hydrogen line profiles characterized the 2003 spectroscopic event but not the preceding one in 1997 - 98 .",
    "_    figure 2 shows three other hydrogen lines in 1998 and 2003 .",
    "h@xmath2 and p@xmath0 behaved qualitatively like h@xmath1 . in the 2003.58 data h@xmath2 had a flat top at about @xmath11 , while its extraneous absorption near @xmath7 km s@xmath6 was weak because this line has a smaller oscillator strength than h@xmath1 . on the other hand h@xmath0 ,",
    "the high - order balmer line which is least confused with adjoining features , did not show much difference between 1998.00 and 2003.58 ; on both occasions it resembled a compromise between the 1998 ( high - peaked ) and the 2003 ( flat - topped ) shapes seen in h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 . in wind models like that described by @xcite , h@xmath0 originates at smaller radii than do h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 .",
    "the paschen lines are somewhat more difficult to interpret in this object @xcite .",
    "emission lines of fe  ii and he  i varied in more complex ways , beyond the scope of this paper .    on three occasions before the stis became available , the hst s faint object spectrograph ( fos ) was used to obtain spectra of @xmath0 car with spatial resolution better than 0.3 @xcite . since h@xmath1 was too bright to observe with the fos , table 2 lists the equivalent width of h@xmath2 from 1991 to 2003 . by a significant margin , the smallest observed values occurred during the 2003 event .",
    "figure 3 shows how the total h@xmath1 emission and its p cyg absorption varied with time .",
    "the 2003 event provided the following clues regarding h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 : + @xmath9 some developments occurred rapidly .",
    "for instance , as p cyg absorption deepened , the h@xmath1 flux at doppler velocities near @xmath12 km s@xmath6 declined from @xmath13 to @xmath14 in 21 days , and then fell to only @xmath15 in the next 12 days .",
    "+ @xmath9 other characteristics appeared earlier and developed more gradually .",
    "the decrease in total h@xmath1 emission was well underway at 2003.24 , three months before the rapid stage of the event .",
    "( note the smooth turnovers soon after 2003.0 in both parts of fig .  3 . ) + @xmath9 the p cyg absorption feature did not vanish as abruptly as it had deepened ; it remained substantial five months after the rapid phase mentioned above .",
    "( in fig .",
    "1d , compare 2003.88 to 2003.12 at velocities around @xmath8 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "+ @xmath9 the fos and stis data suggest , albeit uncertainly , that h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 may tend to be brightest between 1.5 and 0.5 years before an event .    some of these remarks have parallels in other reported observations , such as near - infrared photometry @xcite , helium line strengths seen in ground - based data @xcite , and the x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy of the type reported here is especially valuable , however , because it is more specific ; it samples larger numbers of observables and structural parameters of the wind than x - rays or photometry do .",
    "( photometry , moreover , is affected by varying circumstellar extinction , while the observable 210 kev x - rays probably represent only the hottest parts of a localized shock structure , almost independent of the large - scale wind . )    in summary , we have found an element of paradox in the 19982003 spectroscopic cycle : the h@xmath1 profile was _ least _ flat - topped during the 199798 event , but then was _ most _ flat - topped during the 2003 event ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "since it partially recovered after 2003.7 , this is not simply a long - term trend .",
    "whenever moderate changes are seen in @xmath0 car , one is tempted to ascribe them to routine lbv - style outbursts and fluctuations like those reviewed by @xcite . in this case , however , two circumstances make that view unappealing .    first , the minimum intensity and maximum flattening of h@xmath1 coincided perfectly with the mid-2003 spectroscopic event ( figs .",
    "1c and 3 ) .",
    "if the previous event in 199798 had not been observed , we would now assume that this behavior is merely a detail of the 5.5-year cycle .",
    "in fact , however , the earlier stis data and ground - based spectroscopy reported by @xcite show that no similar development occurred in 199798 .",
    "other emission lines also differed between 1998.0 and 2003.5 , but they are more complex and will be discussed in a later , more detailed paper .",
    "admittedly each spectroscopic event may be sensitive to irregular underlying lbv - like fluctuations , but a second anomaly also occurred during the same period : @xmath0 car has exhibited unusual photometric behavior since 1997 .    in 1998 and again in 2003 , the star s apparent brightness increased at an extraordinary rate and did not appreciably subside later @xcite .",
    "two facts indicate that this was not merely a normal aspect of the 5.5-year cycle .",
    "first , it coincided with the most extreme rise in the ground - based photometric record of the past 50 years ( see remarks in next paragraph ) .",
    "second , the central star has brightened by a factor too large to have occurred repeatedly before 1998 ; if it continues at the rate observed with stis , then after only two or three more 5.5-year periods the star will appear nearly as bright as it did 200 years ago , when there was little circumstellar extinction .    some authors ",
    "@xcite  interpret the recent brightening as a relatively ordinary phenenon , perhaps a normal `` lbv s dor phase , '' but such a view is difficult to sustain even if one ignores the hst photometry .",
    "it is true that ground - based photometry showed one or two earlier examples of rapid brightening , especially around 1981 when the homunculus brightened by 0.3 magnitude at visual wavelengths . in some published figures",
    ", the 1981 episode appears more conspicuous than the 199899 increase merely because it had more data points ; see fig .",
    "2b in @xcite and fig .  7 in @xcite .",
    "however , soon after 1981 the brightness subsided by nearly the same amount , so there was no departure from the longer - term trend line .",
    "the 19962004 visual - wavelength record shows a larger increase , while  more important  the brightness has not returned to `` normal . '' in 2003 it was still almost 0.3 magnitude above the average 19521992 trend line .",
    "this has not been an ordinary lbv or s dor eruption , since the spectrum has not changed appropriately . moreover",
    ", the above statements refer mainly to the homunculus , while our hst photometry of the central star shows a far more dramatic increase since 1997 ( see below ) .",
    "this must be a recent development , not a continuation of a long - term trend , since an extrapolation of the 19972003 rate of change back to about 1985 would `` predict '' that the central star should have been fainter than the weigelt condensations at that time , contrary to speckle observations reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in other words , the rate must have accelerated sometime in the 1990 s .",
    "altogether , then , @xmath0 car s brightening since 1997 has _ not _ been like anything else in the modern photometric record .",
    "something similar may have occurred in 19381952 @xcite , but not more recently .",
    "some interpretive details are essential . during 19982003",
    "the apparent red - wavelength brightness of the central star tripled according to hst / stis observations @xcite , and the visual - wavelength increase was probably larger .",
    "since the star is close to the eddington limit and has shown only moderate spectral changes , this development can not have been entirely an intrinsic brightening ; it must have included a rapid decrease of the circumstellar extinction . for reasons noted by @xcite",
    ", this almost surely indicates a real decrease in the amount of dust near the star ( @xmath16 au ) , and not , e.g. , movement of a dusty condensation that intercepts our line of sight .",
    "either existing dust was destroyed , or the dust formation rate decreased in the mass outflow a few hundred au from the star , or both .",
    "plausible causes involve changes in the stellar wind and/or its emergent radiation field .",
    "therefore _ it is not easy to explain the recent brightening without invoking some change in the star itself . _",
    "thus , two concurrent developments  a striking difference between the 1998.0 and 2003.5 spectroscopic events , and the unprecedented brightening in 19982003  lead us to suspect that _ @xmath0",
    "car s outer layers have recently changed at an unusually rapid rate .",
    "_ this possibility is consistent with certain earlier peculiarities in the historical record , and with the physical state of the object .",
    "this star s thermal and rotational structure has been gradually recovering from the great eruption that occurred in the 1840 s @xcite .",
    "one might assume that today , 160 years after the eruption , the star has approached a quasi - steady state , and that the long - term photometric brightening is caused only by expansion of dusty ejecta .",
    "but such a guess appears to be incorrect : a pronounced systematic he  i @xmath1710830 decrease observed since 1980 @xcite , the spectroscopy reported in this paper , and other factors all indicate that the structure of the wind continues to evolve .",
    "therefore , presumably , so does the outer structure of the star , and the overall timescale seems theoretically reasonable @xcite .",
    "lacking exact models for the readjustment process , we should not be very surprised if the luminosity , radius , and wind parameters occasionally exhibit abnormal rates of change . @xcite and @xcite have noted that four remarkable episodes  the great eruption , the second eruption in the 1890 s , a mysterious photometric - spectroscopic change during the 1940 s ( see below ) , and the recent brightening  were separated by roughly 50-year intervals . even if this timescale proves illusory , the developments just named were clearly real .",
    "for example , evidence indicates that the present - day form of the 5.5-year cycle first appeared sometime in the 1940 s . @xcite",
    "have found that spectrograms from the years 18991919 show no sign of he  i emission at the level now usually observed in @xmath0 car , and @xcite has extended the same statement to 1941 based on spectrograms in the harvard plate collection .",
    "apparently , during that entire period the stellar wind was in its `` low - excitation '' state , now seen only during a spectroscopic event .",
    "a high - excitation state appeared , however , sometime before the early 1950 s @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the photometric behavior changed dramatically during the same era .",
    "following about 40 years of near - constant apparent magnitude , @xmath0 car brightened significantly between 1938 and 1941 @xcite ; then @xcite observed an extremely rapid jump , after which the consistent photometric trend of 19521992 began .",
    "therefore the photometric trend and the spectroscopic state both changed conspicuously in an interval of less than 15 years .",
    "the role of that episode in the current binary vs.  single - star puzzle is unclear , but a change in the observed stellar wind almost certainly occurred .",
    "most likely the mass - loss rate was substantially larger before 1938 , or at least a lower - density zone at low latitudes @xcite did not exist then .",
    "the 193852 change may have been the stage of recovery when the surface rotation rate had spun up to a rate sufficient for the polar and equatorial wind zones to separate .",
    "regardless of the precise explanation , the record of those years suggests that a new and roughly analogous development might occur again .",
    "certain ground - based observations support the idea that a rapid development is now underway . during the past 20 years the he  i",
    "@xmath1710830 emission has shown a clear secular trend toward lower intensity @xcite ; indeed those authors figure 2 seems to foretell a culmination of the trend in the near future .",
    "some parameters of the 5.5-year cycle in near - ir photometry @xcite may also show progressive tendencies , admittedly less definite than the he  i @xmath1710830 behavior .    in summary :",
    "the stis spectroscopy reported in this paper , hst and other photometry , damineli s he  i @xmath1710830 observations , the 193852 precedent , and additional factors together inspire our suspicion that @xmath0 car is now in an usually rapid stage of its post - eruption thermal and rotational recovery .",
    "we do not claim to have proven this conjecture , and quantitative models are obviously needed ; but the qualitative hypothesis appears coherent , plausible , and interesting .    without theoretical models far beyond the scope of this paper",
    ", one can not make a detailed forecast .",
    "the star may become more stable during the next 10 or 20 years , as it probably was before the year 1700 , perhaps with a decreased mass - loss rate .",
    "less likely , the wind might instead increase , as it did between 1750 and 1830 @xcite . in either case",
    "we should not be surprised if the latitude structure discussed by @xcite evolves on the same time scale , related to the surface rotation rate .",
    "assertions like these are not qualitatively new , but we suggest that the relevant time scale may currently be only 10 or 20 years rather than more than 40 years as usually assumed in the past . even if the rate of brightening abates somewhat from its recent average , by about the year 2020 the central star will have become brighter than the homunculus nebula and their total will be of 4th apparent visual magnitude  in other words , to the unaided eye @xmath0 car will appear much as it did to halley more than three centuries ago .",
    "independent of the conjecture expressed above , the hst / stis data reported in section 3 provide valuable information on the nature of a spectroscopic event , unmatched by any existing ground - based data .",
    "the h@xmath1 profile seen in mid-2003 is difficult to interpret because it represents a complex morphology , not necessarily spherical .",
    "the main difference between the 1998.0 and 2003.5 profiles ( fig .",
    "1 ) is that material with doppler velocities near zero , either slow - moving gas or else mass flow near the plane of the sky , became less conspicuous during the 2003 event .",
    "the absence of a central line peak accounts for most of the decrease in total emission .",
    "several rival explanations of @xmath0 car s spectroscopic events are available : + @xmath9 each event may be primarily a mass - ejection episode _ a l _ @xcite , or at least a global disturbance in the wind geometry",
    ". the ejection morphology may be shell - like or toroidal , and the event may be triggered by the close approach of a hypothetical companion star ",
    "although the latter detail is not a necessary part of this scenario .",
    "+ @xmath9 alternatively , temporary spectroscopic changes of the same type may result if a hot secondary star moves behind the primary wind , so that its uv photons can not excite the side of the wind that faces us .",
    "( this is not , properly speaking , an eclipse , since the hypothetical secondary star does not directly contribute much to the brightness at any time . ) + @xmath9 or , perhaps , the excitation and ionization of visible parts of the primary wind may decrease when a hot secondary star s ultraviolet photons become engulfed , near periastron , in the primary s dense inner wind . +",
    "other possibilities may exist but these are the most obvious .",
    "they are merely _ ideas , _ not models ; none of them is straightforward , none of them has been calculated , and they are not mutually exclusive @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the observations reported here do not provide an immediate , simple qualitative test , as we noted in section 3 , flat - topped emission lines seem especially natural in an expanding shell ; but this remark does not prove the other two ideas wrong . instead of advocating a particular scenario , here we draw attention to two points : ( 1 ) the line profiles and flux variations observed with stis provide essential constraints for realistic models , and ( 2 )",
    "_ one must ask why the 1997 - 98 event did not exhibit the same emission - line behavior . _    several other aspects of our data merit consideration . for instance , the line peak shifted from negative to positive velocities during the 2003 event ",
    "e.g. , compare 2003.37 to 2003.72 in fig .",
    "1c . in a binary - star model",
    "this may be a clue to the orbit orientation . in almost every proposed binary scenario ,",
    "the 5.5-year orbit is highly eccentric ( @xmath18 ) and a spectroscopic event occurs near periastron .",
    "suppose the major axis is roughly perpendicular to our line of sight , and in mid-2003 the hot companion star was near periastron and moving away from us .",
    "in that case , before and after periastron it would have tended to excite material , respectively , on our side of the primary wind and then on the other side  emphasizing negative and then positive velocities as observed . the same arrangement can account for the fact that h@xmath1 p cyg absorption , the x - ray flux , and some other observables change rapidly just before the event reaches its maximum , and recover more gradually afterward .",
    "this orbit orientation has been advocated by @xcite and @xcite regarding the x - ray behavior , but it is quite different from that proposed by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . _ caveat : _ like most discussions of binary models for @xmath0 car , these remarks are highly speculative and one can easily invent alternatives @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen lines help to define accurately when the 2003 event occurred .",
    "figure 4 shows the behavior of six observables representing @xmath0 car s wind ; evidently the best time - markers for the event were the near - infrared flux ( fig .",
    "4b ) , the h@xmath1 p cyg absorption ( fig .",
    "4d ) , and perhaps the he  i @xmath176680 flux ( fig .",
    "the x - ray flux also changed rapidly ( fig .",
    "4f ) , but in an erratic manner that did not match the curve seen in late 1997 @xcite .",
    "the final deepening of the p cyg feature occurred close to mjd = 52820 , several days before the midpoint of the h - band photometric drop reported by @xcite  i.e. , at the beginning of july 2003 with an uncertainty of only a few days . unfortunately , it is not clear that comparable observations will be attempted during the next event in early 2009 .",
    "the hst / stis will not be available then , while , ironically , ground - based work is also becoming more difficult due to the shortage of appropriate small telescopes . on the other hand , if the central star continues to grow in brightness relative to the homunculus nebula , adequate visual - wavelength spectroscopy of it will become feasible with ground - based equipment .    figures 3 and 4 suggest two characteristic time - scales for an event : 100200 d for some parameters , and 520 d for the most rapid changes .",
    "the former might be the quadrature - to - periastron time for an eccentric binary orbit , or the star s rotation period , or the thermal / dynamical timescale for growth of an instability in @xmath0 car s outer layers .",
    "the latter , shorter timescale seems a `` natural '' value for a disturbance in the wind : 500 km s@xmath6 @xmath5 10 d @xmath4 3 au , which is the order - of - magnitude characteristic size for the inner wind and also for the periastron of an eccentric binary orbit with a 5.5-year period .",
    "the star s dynamical timescale is also of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we emphasize again that our main point is practically model - independent : the 1997 - 98 and 2003 events differed in respects which probably indicate a serious change in the stellar wind structure .",
    "the detailed line profiles will be valuable for constraining models , but that , in a sense , will be a second - order application of the data .",
    "the complex behavior of he  i , fe  ii , and other spectral features of the stellar wind observed with hst / stis , as well as spectroscopy of ejecta at radii @xmath19 0.1 , will be reported in a series of future papers .",
    "finally , we caution that all observations and most comments in this paper refer only to our direct view of the star .",
    "reflection in the homunculus nebula allows an indirect `` polar '' view of @xmath0 car , with potentially different emission line profiles .",
    "a preliminary report on that view , employing the ground - based vlt / uves instrument , will be given in a companion paper by @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to beth perriello at stsci for extensive assistance in planning the treasury project observations , and to matt gray and michael koppelman at the university of minnesota for helping with non - routine steps in the data preparation and analysis .",
    "we thank an anonymous reviewer for drawing our attention to several points where the original version of this paper was insufficiently clear .    the hst treasury project for eta carinae is supported by nasa funding from stsci ( programs go-9420 and go-9973 ) , and in this paper",
    "we have employed hst data from several earlier go and gto programs .",
