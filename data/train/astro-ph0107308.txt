    "over half of all stars in the sky are actually multiple star systems and , of the binaries , about half again are close enough to one another for mass to be exchanged between the components at some point in their evolution @xcite .",
    "there is a subset of these close binary systems in which periodic or aperiodic variations in luminosity and spectral features can be explained by on - going mass - transfer events and instabilities in the accretion flow .",
    "for example , long term stable mass transfer in which the accretor is either a white dwarf , a neutron star , or a black hole is widely recognized as the mechanism powering cataclysmic variables @xcite and x - ray sources @xcite . in algol  type systems an evolved star transfers mass via roche lobe overflow to a near main  sequence accretor @xcite .",
    "each of these systems evolves on a ( secular ) time scale that is long compared to the orbital period of the system , with the mass - transfer rate determined by angular momentum losses from the binary , and thermal relaxation and nuclear evolution of the donor star . in these systems ,",
    "the fraction of the donor s mass that is transferred during one orbit is typically @xmath1 to @xmath2 , many orders of magnitude less than what current numerical 3-d hydrocodes can resolve .",
    "all of the above systems must have descended from binaries in which the accretor of today was initially the more massive component who evolved first off the main  sequence .",
    "the mass transfer in these progenitor systems was in many instances dynamically unstable , yielding mass  transfer rates many orders of magnitude above the currently observed rates and leading in some cases to a common envelope phase ( see e.g. warner 1995 ; verbunt & van den heuvel 1995 ; nelson & eggleton 2001 )    in addition , there is a wide class of binary star systems not presently undergoing mass - transfer for which the astrophysical scenarios that have been proposed to explain their origin or ultimate fate involve dynamical or thermal mass - transfer in a close binary , sometimes leading to a common envelope phase of evolution . examples of such systems are millisecond pulsars @xcite , some central stars of planetary nebulae @xcite , double degenerate white dwarf binaries , perhaps leading to supernovae of type ia through a merger @xcite , or subdwarf sd0 , sdb stars @xcite , and double neutron star binaries , perhaps yielding @xmath3-ray bursts in a fireball when the neutron stars coalesce @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary scenarios that are drawn upon to explain the existence of some of these systems call for events in which @xmath4 or more of the donor s mass can be transferred during a single orbit .",
    "if we are to fully understand these rich classes of astrophysically interesting systems  their origin , present evolutionary state , and ultimate fate  it seems clear that we will have to develop numerical algorithms that can accurately simulate mass - transfer events in binary systems under a wide range of physical conditions ( for example , systems having a wide range of total masses , mass ratios , and ages ) over both short and long evolutionary time scales . the astrophysics community as a whole is far from achieving this ultimate goal , but progress is being made as various groups are methodically tackling small pieces of this very large and imposing problem .",
    "examples of recent progress in the numerical simulation of interacting binaries include two - dimensional simulation of mass transfer in algol @xcite , three - dimensional evolutions of roche lobe overflow in lmc x-4 @xcite and the accretion stream in @xmath5 lyrae @xcite , simulations of the common envelope phase and merger of a point - mass white dwarf with a red giant star @xcite , neutron star binary and black hole - neutron star binary mergers in the context of @xmath3-ray bursts @xcite and the dispersal of the secondary star s material in type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "building on our experience simulating the nonlinear development of dynamical instabilities in self - gravitating systems  such as protostellar gas clouds @xcite , stellar cores @xcite , and young neutron stars @xcite  and on our experience in studying mass - transfer in close binaries through analytical and semi - analytical techniques @xcite we are developing a hydrodynamical tool to study relatively _ rapid _ phases of mass - transfer in binary systems . our immediate aim is to be able to follow the dynamical redistribution of material through @xmath6 orbits after the onset of a mass - transfer instability , in binary systems having a wide range of initial mass ratios with either star initially selected to be in contact with its roche lobe and thereby become the `` donor '' .",
    "our simulation tool treats both stars as self - gravitating fluids ; they are embedded in the computational grid in such a way that their internal structures are both fully resolved ; and the system as a whole is evolved forward in time through an explicit integration of the standard fluid equations , coupled with the poisson equation so that the newtonian gravitational field changes along with the mass distribution in a fully self - consistent way . initially we will examine structures that can be well - represented by relatively simple barotropic ( and adiabatic ) equations of state , but this constraint can easily be lifted in the future .",
    "we will be restricted to studies of relatively rapid phases of mass - transfer because we are integrating the equations of motion forward in time via an explicit integration scheme .    while this simulation tool will not permit us to model stable flows with low mass - transfer rates",
    " such as the observed flows in cvs and x - ray binaries  it should be capable of a wide range of astrophysical applications including : a determination of the conditions required to become unstable toward dynamical mass - transfer in all kinds of close binaries with normal and degenerate components ; the ability to follow dynamical phases of mass transfer through to completion , which may mean a return to stability at a new system mass ratio , the formation of a massive disk or a common envelope with or without rapid mass loss from the system , or a merger of the two objects into one ; and an investigation of the steady - state structure of secularly stable binaries . through such investigations",
    "we will be able to place on much firmer footing a variety of theoretical scenarios ( as alluded to above ) that have been proposed to explain the evolution and fate of close binary systems .    with the commissioning of gravitational wave interferometers such as tama , ligo , and virgo ,",
    "there has been a growing interest in understanding the detailed behavior of , especially , neutron star inspirals and mergers . as has been reviewed by swesty , wang and calder ( 2000 ; hereafter swc ) , a number of different groups have developed hydrodynamical codes to simulate the late stages of inspiral and merger of such compact objects . indeed , as has been described by @xcite and reviewed by swc , an earlier version of our own simulation tool has been used to study the dynamical merger of equal - mass systems in which the stellar components were modeled with polytropic , white dwarf , and neutron star equations of state . generally speaking ,",
    "however , the last phase of a neutron star inspiral can be modeled with a hydrodynamical code that is less sensitive to initial conditions and more tolerant of errors in the algorithm that integrates the fluid equations forward in time than a hydrodynamical code that is designed to study more generic mass - transfer events in close binary systems .",
    "this is because general relativistic effects will necessarily drive a binary neutron star system to smaller separation , guaranteeing that the system will merge ; and , even in the absence of relativistic effects , it appears as though a tidal instability that disrupts one or both stars will be encountered before either fills its roche lobe and encounters a classic mass - transfer instability @xcite .",
    "building on the work of @xcite , we now have a simulation tool that can hydrodynamically follow the orbital evolution of binary stars with high precision .",
    "in developing this tool we have made a number of improvements to the hydrodynamics algorithm that was used in this earlier work only to study the tidal merger problem .",
    "we also have implemented a self - consistent - field algorithm that can construct very accurate initial equilibrium models of unequal - mass binaries in circular orbits , have paid special attention to the manner in which initial models are introduced into the hydrodynamics code , and have taken full advantage of continuing improvements in high - performance computers . with this tool in hand",
    ", we should be able to accurately model the evolution of a much broader class of close binary systems , specifically , systems in which the components initially have unequal mass and/or radii and in which a mass - transfer instability rather than a tidal instability sets in . with the inclusion of appropriate relativistic corrections , this simulation tool should in principle",
    "also be able to simulate the merger of equal or unequal mass neutron star binaries , but our intention is not to focus so narrowly on this particular class of systems .    in  2 of this paper , we collect results from theoretical investigations of the linear stability of mass transfer in close binaries and discuss the approximations that have been required to arrive at these results . in ",
    "3 we present the self - consistent field method we use for the construction of initial , equilibrium models .",
    "we then describe our implementation of a parallel hydrodynamics code for the solution of the ideal fluid equations and poisson s equation for an isolated mass distribution in  4 . in  5",
    "we compare results from the hydrodynamics code with known solutions for a set of test problems and in  6 we present the results from the evolution of two benchmark detached binaries .",
    "these simulations demonstrate our ability to faithfully represent the forces acting on the fluid and allow us to estimate the mass transfer rate we will be able to resolve and the computational expense required to evolve a given system through an interesting number of orbits .",
    "we conclude in  7 by summarizing the limits we have been able to attain at practical simulation resolutions and discuss the future application of the tool set to systems of interest .",
    "in this section we will argue that roche lobe overflow in a binary system approximated by two polytropic components can result in mass transfer on a dynamical time scale for a certain range of polytropic indices .",
    "a spherical polytrope with uniform entropy in mechanical equilibrium obeys the following mass radius relation ( c.f .",
    "* ) , @xmath7 which implies , @xmath8 hence , the body will expand upon mass loss for polytropic indices satisfying @xmath9 .    consider paczyski s ( 1971 ) approximation for the effective roche lobe radius @xmath10 of a donor star , taken to be the secondary , with mass @xmath11 in a point mass binary of total mass @xmath12 and separation @xmath13 , @xmath14 from this",
    ", one obtains the following relation for the logarithmic change in the donor s roche lobe radius , @xmath15 upon eliminating the separation in favor of the system s orbital angular momentum @xmath16 , one arrives at @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the accreting star , taken to be the primary .",
    "if we further assume that the mass transfer is conservative with respect to the total mass and orbital angular momentum we deduce that , @xmath19 comparing equation ( [ eq : xi_poly ] ) with equation ( [ eq : log_roche_r ] ) , the condition for stable mass transfer , @xmath20 can be expressed as , @xmath21 which , for a given polytropic index , implies a stable mass ratio @xmath22 for a polytropic binary with @xmath23 and mass ratio @xmath24 , mass transfer must occur on a dynamical time scale as the donor will readjust its structure within a few sound crossing times to its new mass .",
    "note that if the donor is initially the less massive star ( i.e. @xmath25 ) , the binary separation is expected to steadily increase during the mass transfer event .",
    "but , if the donor is initially the more massive component ( i.e. @xmath26 ) , conservation of orbital angular momentum implies that the separation must decrease and that the donor s roche lobe radius will contract thus increasing the degree of overflow .",
    "the resulting mass transfer rate is expected in this case to be quite substantial .",
    "the dependence of the mass transfer rate on the degree of over - contact can be estimated from the product of the volume swept out by the flow near the inner lagrange point , @xmath27 , in unit time and the local value of the density .",
    "the cross section of the flow near @xmath27 will scale as the square of the local sound speed , and the flow velocity is approximately equal to the sound speed .",
    "the volume of material transferred in unit time then scales as the cube of the sound speed .",
    "the density near the edge of a spherical polytrope of index @xmath28 , radius @xmath29 , mass @xmath11 , and polytropic constant @xmath30 can be found by integrating the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to obtain , @xmath31^{n}.\\ ] ] if we change variables to @xmath32 , the width of a spherical shell near the edge of the star , we obtain @xmath33 the sound speed , @xmath34 in turn obeys , @xmath35 so that @xmath36 taking the radius , @xmath37 , to be the effective roche lobe radius of the donor , @xmath38 is the degree of over - contact . the mass transfer rate is then expected to scale with the degree of over - contact as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the orbital period .",
    "this agrees with the calculation of jedrzjec as presented in @xcite . for a polytropic index of @xmath23 ,",
    "( [ eq : mdot ] ) indicates that the mass transfer rate will scale as the cube of the degree of over - contact .",
    "while the actual mass transfer rate observed in a fully self - consistent , three - dimensional evolution may differ substantially from the estimate given in ( [ eq : mdot ] ) , it nevertheless indicates that for unstable binaries mass - transfer events will evolve on a dynamical time scale once the donor reaches contact with its roche lobe .",
    "all the results presented in this section have relied on a great many simplifying assumptions including the disregard of internal angular momentum ( spin ) in each star , the use of the roche model , neglecting the intrinsically nonspherical geometry of the components , and assuming that the mass transfer event is , in fact , conservative . to proceed beyond this point one must deal with extended distributions for the density and velocity in some approximation .",
    "we would argue further that it is advantageous to use a potential derived from the matter distribution in a self - consistent manner . with these additional complications ,",
    "the task is well beyond the regime of analytical mechanics , but is tractable if we employ three - dimensional computational fluid dynamical techniques . to investigate short time - scale mass transfer events numerically ,",
    "we have developed a set of tools for both constructing equilibrium polytropic binaries and a hydrodynamics code to evolve systems of interest in time .",
    "these tools are described below .",
    "the iterative method that we have used to generate equilibrium , polytropic binaries is very closely related to the self - consistent field ( scf ) technique developed by hachisu ( 1986 ; see also hachisu , eriguchi & nomoto 1986 ) .",
    "this technique previously has been used to construct initial models of _ equal_-mass binary systems for dynamical studies of the binary merger problem ( see new & tohline 1997 and swc ) . here",
    "we employ a more generalized version of the technique to construct _ unequal_-mass binaries . in the following discussion we use @xmath41 to refer to an arbitrary point in space .",
    "the vector @xmath42 is the cylindrical radius vector which can be expressed as @xmath43 .",
    "the axis of rotation is always taken to be parallel to , but not necessarily coincident with , the @xmath44-axis .",
    "the numerical results presented here are in a system of units where the gravitational constant , the radial extent of our numerical grid and the maximum density of one binary component are all taken to be unity .",
    "as we are treating polytropic models exclusively in the present work , these models can be scaled to represent different physical systems by choosing a total system mass or orbital separation for example .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the polytropic models could represent binaries consisting of neutron stars , white dwarfs or normal stellar components .",
    "assuming synchronous rotation",
    "so that the bodies are stationary in a corotating reference frame , the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium reduce to the following single vector equation , @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the gravitational potential , @xmath47 is the angular velocity of the reference frame in which the fluid is stationary , h is the enthalpy , and @xmath48 is the cylindrical radius vector of the system s center of mass so that @xmath49 is each fluid element s distance from the axis of rotation . for a polytrope of index @xmath28 , @xmath50",
    "is given to within an arbitrary constant by @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the pressure and density of the fluid , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ eq : euler_equation_static ] ) in turn implies that , @xmath54 for some constant @xmath55 , which in general will be different for each binary component .",
    "hereafter we denote these two integration constants as @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : iteration ] ) one can construct an iterative scheme as follows .",
    "an initial guess at the density field is constructed .",
    "poisson s equation is solved to obtain the gravitational potential arising from the chosen mass distribution .",
    "this is , by far , the most computationally intensive part of the algorithm . for our work , we have chosen a cylindrical coordinate grid and utilized subroutines from the fishpack fortran subroutine set for the solution of elliptic partial differential equations @xcite with the boundary potential being calculated via a spherical harmonic expansion of the density field utilizing harmonic moments through @xmath58 .    with the gravitational potential in hand we can use algebraic relations at three boundary points where",
    "the density field is forced to vanish in order to set the integration constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and the value of the angular velocity @xmath47 .",
    "the boundary points all lie along the line of centers .",
    "they correspond to the inner and outer boundary points for one star , and the inner boundary point for the companion as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary_points ] .",
    "the values of the gravitational potential at the three boundary points , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are used to solve for the set of constants @xmath47 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 as follows : @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 equation ( [ eq : iteration ] ) can then be used to construct the enthalpy throughout the computational domain and , from it , an improved density distribution can be constructed using the relation , @xmath67 where @xmath68 labels the two stellar components . as @xcite has explained , it is best to hold the values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 fixed throughout the iteration cycles .",
    "the iteration cycle is then repeated using the improved density distribution until the relative change from iteration to iteration in @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath47 , and @xmath71 are all smaller than some prescribed convergence criterion , @xmath72 . for a grid resolution of 128 radial points by 128 vertical points by 256 points in azimuth",
    ", we typically use a tolerance @xmath73 .",
    "unfortunately the self - consistent field method does not allow one to specify physically meaningful parameters such as the binary mass ratio or separation _ a priori_. instead , as already described , it is best to specify the three boundary points and the maximum density for each body",
    ". nevertheless , the method described above remains , to our knowledge , the most effective means of generating fully self - consistent models of synchronously rotating , equilibrium binary systems with unequal masses and/or radii .",
    "we gauge the quality of a converged solution by the degree to which it satisfies the scalar virial equation .",
    "specifically , we define the following dimensionless virial error @xmath74 where the terms appearing in equation ( [ eq : virial - error ] ) are defined by the following integral quantities : @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the velocity field as measured in the inertial frame of reference . as applied in the scf technique , the velocity is entirely due to the rotation of the frame , that is @xmath79    in fig .",

    "one binary is an equal mass system with identical components ( see model 5 in table [ tab : scf_models ] and figs.[fig : scf_side][fig : scf_top ] ; hereafter referred to as the eb system ) and the other system has a mass ratio @xmath266 ( see model 6 in table [ tab : scf_models ] and figs.[fig : scf_side] [ fig : scf_top ] ; hereafter referred to as unequal binary or ub system ) . the eb system was constructed to resemble the single star used for the test of hydrostatic equilibrium in  [ sec : equilibrium_test ] .",
    "this enables us to compare the systematic errors in the case of a binary system given the errors observed when only gravity , pressure and the curvature force came into play .",
    "each component of the eb system differs from the isolated , spherical star in that each is flattened by the synchronous rotation of the system and tidally distorted by its companion , but the components have a comparable size , in terms of grid cells , and the same central density and polytropic index as the isolated sphere .",
    "previous simulations of equal - mass barotropic stars have shown that it is important to conduct the evolutions in a frame of reference that renders the binary as close to static as possible in order to minimize the effects of numerical diffusion arising from the finite accuracy of eulerian advection schemes ( new & tohline 1997 ; swc ) . with this in mind , our eb and ub simulations have been conducted in a frame of reference rotating with the orbital angular velocity @xmath47 of the system , as obtained by our scf technique .    in dealing with unequal - mass systems",
    "we have discovered another subtle , but important issue that should be addressed with care when `` transporting '' an initial hydrostatic model from the grid of the scf code into the grid of the hydrodynamics code . during each scf iteration , the system s center of mass",
    "is not fixed to any location beyond the fact that , by symmetry , it must lie along the line of centers . in general",
    ", then , we must translate the density field as we introduce it into the hydrocode so that the system center of mass coincides with the @xmath44-axis , which is taken to be the rotation axis for the hydrodynamic evolution . if we could perform this translation perfectly",
    ", all initial fluid velocities would be identically zero relative to the hydrodynamic reference frame .",
    "because of the inherent symmetry of an equal - mass binary system , this was in fact the case for our eb system by construction .",
    "for the ub system , however , the center of mass of our converged scf model was displaced by a small distance from the rotation axis .",
    "specifically , @xmath267 , which corresponded to only @xmath268 , where @xmath269 is the radial extent of each grid cell . as we introduced the scf model into the hydrodynamical grid , we therefore also ascribed nonzero velocities as initial conditions according to the relation , @xmath270 because the displacement @xmath271 was quite small for our ub system , the initial velocities prescribed through eq.([eq : com_vel ] ) were also very small",
    "nevertheless , it was necessary to include them in order to achieve the best possible steady - state configurations corresponding to the stars following circular orbits .",
    "this implies a uniform initial velocity for the system ( see further discussion below ) .",
    "after the binary models were introduced into the hydrodynamics code , both were evolved through more than five orbits .",

    "many different diagnostic parameters were followed throughout both evolutions in order to assess the quality of the initial scf models and to determine with what accuracy the hydrodynamical equations were being integrated forward in time . in the following paragraphs , we present the time - evolutionary behavior of a number of these key physical parameters .",

    ", we tracked three separate volume integrals over the mass density : @xmath291 , defined as the mass bound to the primary ; @xmath292 , defined as the mass bound to the secondary ; and @xmath293 , defined as the mass that lies outside of both stars but inside the boundaries of the computational grid .",

    "( in these benchmark evolutions , this is evidenced for example by the very small , but finite oscillations in the `` volumes '' occupied by the stars that are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : eb_vols ] - [ fig : ub_2_vols ] . ) in practice , then , during each evolution we determine whether material in each grid cell belongs to either star or the `` envelope '' by comparing the binding energy of the fluid in each cell to the average binding energy of the layer of cells at the surface of each star . in this context , we define the surface of each star to be the layer of cells where the mass density falls below @xmath80 in our normalized units , which corresponds to the lowest density level attained in the initial scf models .",

    "plotted on a normal , linear scale , all four of these curves are perfectly flat in both figures .",

    "although mass is conserved to very high precision , it is not absolutely constant throughout the evolutions . in the four insets of figs .",
    "[ fig : eb_mass ] and [ fig : ub_mass ] , we have magnified the vertical mass scale by roughly four orders of magnitude in order to show that there is a very tiny , but measurable , secular decrease in the total system mass and in the mass of both stellar components over the course of the simulations . in each inset",
    ", we plot the relevant mass minus its value in the initial state ( time @xmath302 ) , normalized to the total system mass .",
    "these inset plots show that the system mass decreases by approximately one part in @xmath303 over five orbits  that is , about @xmath304 per orbit  with the mass loss from each star accounting for roughly half this total . in rows",

    "we have determined that this mass is very slowly lost as a result of the development of a small , but nonzero flow of low - density material off of the stars , through the envelope and , ultimately , off of the grid .",
    "( after an initial drop , the envelope mass remains approximately constant , suggesting that this outward flow has settled into a nearly steady state . )",
    "as is discussed more fully in  7 , below , this small but detectable rate of mass loss from detached equilibrium binaries imposes a straightforward limit on the mass - transfer rates that we will be able to reliably model in future simulations that involve dynamical mass transfer .      during both simulations we also tracked as a function of time the position of the center of mass of each binary component and the position of the center of mass of the system as a whole .",
    "the equatorial - plane trajectories of these three centers of mass for the eb and ub evolutions are shown , respectively , in figs .  [",

    "( when plotted in the inertial reference frame on this scale the trajectories of the two stars are indistinguishable from circles . )",
    "this illustrates that , even after five orbits , the centers of mass of the two stars and of the system as a whole essentially have not moved from their initial positions .",
    "this provides additional strong confirmation that our scf code produces excellent initial states and that the hydrodynamical equations are being integrated forward in time in a physically realistic manner .    in the bottom three plots of figs .",
    "[ fig : eb_com ] and [ fig : ub_com ] , we have magnified a small region around each of the center of mass trajectories  expanding the linear scale of the uppermost plot in each figure by a approximately a factor of @xmath308 and @xmath309 , respectively .",

    "this indicates the characteristic size of our discretization and emphasizes how small the motion of each center of mass is . in the ub evolution , for example",
    ", the motion of all three centers has been confined within a single grid cell through five full orbits .",
    "furthermore , the smooth spiral trajectory of the ub system center of mass ( bottom , middle plot in fig . [ fig : ub_com ] ) has an understandable , physical origin .",
    "as viewed in the inertial frame , this particular trajectory appears as a straight line whose direction and magnitude is consistent with the overall system velocity prescribed as initial conditions from eq .",
    "( [ eq : com_vel ] ) . in the eb evolution , due to the symmetry of the initial model ,",
    "the drift of the system center of mass is extremely small , remaining unnoticable even on the magnified plot . in the magnified plots ,",
    "the trajectory of the center of mass of each individual star shows both a gradual drift in the @xmath311-direction , and a small oscillatory motion in the @xmath107-direction .",
    "the vertical drift is mostly an indication that the binary s actual orbital frequency is slightly different from the value ( given by the scf code ) that we used for the rotation frequency of the computational grid .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath107 represent epicyclic motion and indicate that the binary orbit is not precisely circular . since both the drift and the epicyclic motion can be understood in physical terms , their small amplitudes tell us more about the quality of the initial model than about the limiting accuracy of our finite - difference scheme .    unlike in the single star case presented in  [ sec : equilibrium_test ] , there is no evidence of a systematic outwards force on either star in the ub or eb systems , despite the fact that the systems have evolved for the equivalent of approximately 90 dynamical times .",
    "it appears as though the introduction of a rotating frame of reference and the associated centrifugal potential and coriolis force has provided a feedback mechanism that acts to limit the systematic imbalance discussed previously .",
    "a plot of the binary separation @xmath13 as a function of time , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : eb_a ] and [ fig : ub_a ] for the eb and ub evolutions , respectively , provides another way to assess the global behavior of these systems . here",

    "this illustrates that , to a very high degree of accuracy , these benchmark simulations of detached binary systems produce stable , circular orbits .",
    "again , though , if we examine these plots in finer detail , we see that both evolutions exhibit a very small but quantifiable departure from perfect circular orbital motion . for example , in the insets to figs .",
    "[ fig : eb_a ] and [ fig : ub_a ] , we have reploted @xmath312 with the vertical scale magnified by roughly a factor of @xmath313 .",
    "these insets show that in both evolutions there is a very slow , secular decrease in the orbital separation and , in addition , @xmath312 displays low - amplitude oscillations having a period approximately equal to one orbital period .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath13 arise from the same epicyclic motion that was seen in the plots ( figs .",
    "[ fig : eb_com ] and [ fig : ub_com ] ) of the center of mass motion of the individual stars , but the amplitude of this motion is easier to measure here . in units of the initial orbital separation , the eb system has an epicyclic amplitude @xmath314 ; the ub system exhibits an epicyclic amplitude about half this size .",
    "the slow , secular decay of the orbits occurs at a rate @xmath315 per orbit in the eb system , and at a rate @xmath316 per orbit in the ub system .",
    "these orbital decay rates and epicyclic amplitudes have been recorded in the fifth and sixth rows of table [ tab : systems ] .      finally , in figs .",
    "[ fig : eb_jz ] and [ fig : ub_jz ] we show the behavior as a function of time of the @xmath44-component of each system s total angular momentum . as was true with our plots of the orbital separation , on a linear scale that extends from @xmath207 to @xmath208 ( in units normalized to the each system",
    "s initial total angular momentum ) , the plot of @xmath317 is indistinguishable from a perfectly horizontal line .",
    "this illustrates that these benchmark simulations globally conserve angular momentum to a very high degree of accuracy .",
    "when we magnify the vertical scale by approximately a factor of @xmath318 , as has been done to produce the insets to figs .",
    "[ fig : eb_jz ] and [ fig : ub_jz ] , we see that angular momentum is not , in fact , perfectly conserved .",
    "evidently both systems gain angular momentum at a very slow rate ; in the eb simulation , @xmath319 per orbit , and in the ub simulation @xmath320 per orbit .",
    "these rates have been recorded in the seventh row of table [ tab : systems ] and will be referred to again in  7 , below , when we summarize the limiting accuracy with which we expect to be able to model physical mass - transfer events using our simulation tools .",
    "we should emphasize that the hydrodynamics code as described in  4 and utilized in these benchmark simulations has evolved through many stages from the version of the code that was used several years ago by @xcite to investigate the equal - mass , binary merger problem .",
    "a number of improvements were made in the code in order to bring it to its present level of performance .",
    "figure 20 is presented here in an effort to illustrate how certain key modifications in the code affected its performance .",
    "each row of frames in this figure shows results from an evolution of the same unequal - mass ( ub ) binary system that was used in our benchmark simulation , but as produced by four separate versions of the code .",
    "the curves drawn in the four frames on the left - hand side of fig.20 show the same type of information as has been presented in fig.10 for the benchmark ub evolution : four separate volumes for the secondary star ( solid curves ) and its roche volume ( dashed curve ) are plotted as a function of time , in units of the orbital period .",
    "the four frames on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "20 show the same type of information as has been presented in the top - most frame of fig .  15 : center - of - mass trajectories of the two stars and of the system as a whole , as viewed from the rotating frame of reference . ( the bottom - most frames are taken from the benchmark ub simulation and therefore are drawn directly from figs .  10 and 15 . )",
    "the results shown in the top - most frames of fig .",
    "20 come from an early version of the code in which we replaced the gradient of the pressure with the gradient of the enthalpy .",
    "this ensured that the initial structure of each star , as determined by the scf code , was in good force balance after being introduced into the hydrocode .",
    "however , as the two figures from this evolution illustrate , we still observed a slow expansion of the secondary star ; the orbit itself developed a significant epicyclic amplitude ; and after about three orbits , the roche lobe was encroaching on the surface of the secondary .",
    "the second row of frames comes from a simulation in which the number of azimuthal zones was doubled  from 128 to 256 zones over the full @xmath321 radians .",
    "this modification improved somewhat the mean motion of the centers of mass ( although it did not significantly reduce the amplitude of the epicyclic motion ) .",
    "most significantly , however , doubling the angular grid size improved the resolution and , hence , the determination of force balance in each star . as a result ,",
    "expansion of the secondary star was noticeably reduced .",
    "the third row of frames shows that motion of the centers of mass was drastically reduced when we modified our algorithm to make the integration scheme more properly time - centered .",
    "this change did not noticeably reduce the rate of expansion of the secondary , but it did significantly reduce the amplitude of oscillations in the roche lobe volume . finally , by introducing artificial viscosity into the equations of motion in order to mediate the weak shocks at the surface of the stars ( which also involved a re - centering of all momentum densities to the cell locations specified in table 3 ) , the entire structure of both stars became much more robust .",
    "in particular , as the left - hand frame of the last row shows ( see also fig . 10 ) , this code modification completely eliminated the short timescale wiggles in the volumes of the secondary ; overall expansion of the secondary also was reduced to an imperceptible level . simultaneously , for the first time , we ascribed a small nonzero velocity to the initial state as given by eq .",
    "this change further reduced the motion of the centers of mass  to the level illustrated by fig .",
    "it is reasonable to ask whether the three principal spurious effects that remain in our benchmark simulations  the slow decay of the orbits , the slow gain of angular momentum , and the slow loss of mass from the stars  are at least mutually consistent on physical grounds . for centrally condensed binaries , a point mass approximation ( the roche approximation ) is usually sufficient to discuss the orbital evolution .",
    "this approximation predicts a simple relationship between the changes of mass , angular momentum and binary separation , namely @xmath322 where @xmath323 is the total center  of  mass angular momentum in the point mass approximation . numerical values for each of the terms in this expression can be obtained from the data shown in table 6 .",
    "in particular , we see that in both benchmark simulations the three mass terms approximately cancel each other out .",
    "but while the magnitude of @xmath324 is roughly the same as the magnitude of @xmath325 , their signs are different .",
    "that is , the angular momentum of the system is slowly increasing while the binary separation is slowly decreasing .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with the expectations of the simple roche model . a more accurate expression for",
    "the total angular momentum of the binary would be @xmath326 where @xmath327 and @xmath328 are the moments of inertia and inertial frame angular velocities of the binary components , assuming they all rotate around the same @xmath44-axis .",
    "even if one takes into account the contributions of spin angular momenta , the changes observed remain inconsistent and must therefore be attributed to spurious numerical effects at a level of @xmath81 per orbit arising from the inevitable error terms present in our finite - difference representation of the fluid equations .",
    "what we have attempted to do here is quantitatively document the magnitude of these numerical effects in the highest practical resolution possible at the present day for simulations of detached binaries where the character of the ideal solution is well understood beforehand .",
    "furthermore , we can not accurately predict the evolution of mass transferring binaries where the mass transfer rate , @xmath329 per orbit is @xmath330 using simulations at the resolution presented here .",
    "there are however a wide variety of systems ( the initial mass transfer event in an algol progenitor , or the onset of common envelope evolution in the progenitors of many types of binaries , or the formation of type ia supernovae for example ) that are expected to exceed our threshold resolution limit for mass transfer . at a sufficiently high mass - transfer rate",
    ", the mass transfer itself will drive the evolution of the orbital parameters and roche geometry at a rate higher than the numerical limits demonstrated here .",
    "in this paper we have presented a practical scf algorithm for constructing self - consistent polytropic binaries with unequal masses that satisfy the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "this three - dimensional scf algorithm is based largely on the technique first described by @xcite , but to our knowledge this is the first time the technique has been used to generate unequal mass binary systems as input for a hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "our two benchmark simulations ( described in  6 ) clearly indicate that this scf algorithm can provide superb initial states for investigations into the dynamical stability of close binary systems .",
    "we emphasize that , in addition to generating models of close binary systems that are detached  like the eb and ub systems constructed for our two benchmark simulations  as shown above in figs .",
    "[ fig : scf_side ] and [ fig : scf_top ] this technique also can be used to generate close binary systems that are semi - detached or , in the limit of identical components , in contact .",
    "we have also detailed our gravitational hydrodynamics code and presented results from key tests of the stability and accuracy of the hydrodynamics algorithm , the solution of poisson s equation , and the coupled solution required to evolve an isolated , spherical polytrope that is placed off - axis in a cylindrical grid . from these test cases",
    "it is apparent that a number of subtle numerical issues arise when a highly nonaxisymmetric body is evolved via an explicit integration of finite - difference equations on a cylindrical computational grid .",
    "it also appears however , that these effects can be made manageably small by increasing the resolution used to treat the system of interest .",
    "we have evolved two detached binary systems ( one with a mass ratio @xmath331 , the other with a mass ratio @xmath332 ) through more than five orbits in order to benchmark in detail the capabilities of our simulation tools . even though the individual stellar components generated by our scf code are significantly rotationally flattened ( due to the synchronous rotation of the initial states ) and tidally distorted ( by their close binary companion ) ,",
    "these benchmark simulations show that the stars are in almost perfect hydrostatic equilibrium . throughout each binary evolution ,",
    "our hydrodynamics code conserves mass and angular momentum to a very high degree of precision ; as viewed from a frame of reference that is rotating with the initial orbital frequency of the binary , the centers of mass of the two stellar components and of the system as a whole remain virtually stationary ; and a plot of the binary separation as a function of time shows that the stellar orbits are almost indistinguishable from circles .",
    "this gives us considerable confidence that these numerical tools can be used to examine the stability of close binary systems against both tidal and mass - transfer instabilities , and to begin to accurately model mass transfer in semi - detached systems .",
    "as has been summarized in table [ tab : systems ] , from our benchmark evolutions we have been able to determine in quantitative terms the level of accuracy with which our hydrodynamical code conserves mass , conserves angular momentum , and is able to represent and maintain a circular binary orbit .",
    "mass is conserved to roughly @xmath333 per orbit ; angular momentum is conserved to a level of @xmath334 - @xmath335 per orbit ; the binary separation remains constant to a few parts in @xmath303 per orbit ; and each orbit exhibits an epicyclic amplitude ( measured relative to the orbital separation ) of @xmath336-@xmath337 .",
    "we are unaware of any other group that is attempting to study the onset of mass - transfer instabilities in unequal - mass binaries with a gravitational hydrodynamics code , like ours , that fully resolves both stellar components .",
    "hence , there are no published numbers against which to compare ours for the ub evolution .",
    "however , we can fairly compare the results of our eb evolution against the recent study published by swc of equal - mass close binary systems .",
    "their fig .",
    "10 illustrates that , after following one stable binary system through approximately @xmath338 orbits ( we assume , based on the swc discussion , that @xmath339 ) , they have been able to conserve angular momentum to a level of about @xmath340 per orbit . and their fig .  14 shows four stable orbits with epicyclic amplitudes ( measured relative to the binary separation ) @xmath341 .",
    "we conclude that , at least in these two respects , our simulations improve on the swc models by roughly one order of magnitude .",
    "swc do not comment on their level of mass conservation ; and , because of the visible epicyclic motions in their fig .",
    "14 , it is difficult to ascertain to what degree the binary separation either decreases or increases with time over the course of their evolutions . in both of our evolutions , however , the center - of - mass motion of our stars appears to be significantly less than the center - of - mass motion depicted for swc s preferred integration scheme in the top - left panel of their fig .",
    "the small , but measurable changes in mass , angular momentum , and binary separation documented here in table [ tab : systems ] set limits on the types of mass - transfer events that we will be able to model with confidence using our present simulation tools .",
    "for example , if we were to try to model an instability that leads to a flow through the binary s l1 lagrange point with a mass - transfer rate lower than one part in @xmath342 per orbit , the physical exchange of material between the binary components would be swamped by the unphysical process that is causing our stars to lose mass to the `` envelope '' at a rate of one to two parts in @xmath343 per orbit .",
    "if the depth of contact between the roche lobe and the surface of the donor star is not sufficient , epicyclic motion in the orbit will tend to shut off the mass - transfer during part of each orbit .",
    "also , a drift in the center of mass of the system can impose a limit on the length of time that the binary can be evolved before the motion of the binary through the grid becomes problematic .",
    "we will have to contend with all of these issues as we move to the next level of our investigation and introduce a semi - detached system from our scf code into our hydrodynamical code .",
    "we expect nevertheless to find a wide range of interesting binary systems whose dynamical evolution can be simulated in a fully self - consistent fashion through a reasonably large number of orbits using the tools that have been described in this paper .",
    "as we have documented in table [ tab : systems ] , the calculation of one orbit takes about 33 wall - clock hours when utilizing 64 processors of the cray t3e 600 , and using 16 processors of the newer ibm sp-3 , the calculation of one orbit takes about 51 hours .",
    "the computational workload of a mass - transfer simulation is therefore within the reach of current , state of the art , parallel computers given the linear scaling of our gravitational hydrodynamics code with the number of processors even at a resolution greater than presented here .",
    "we note that the amount of work performed can be reduced significantly if need be by , for example , freezing the gravitational potential until the mass distribution has changed significantly as done by @xcite .",
    "the solution of poisson s equation represents about a quarter of the total execution time .",
    "we have been able to estimate the mass transfer rate required to bring the simulation above the level of the noise observed in our benchmark simulations .",
    "we find that this value is @xmath344 of the donor s initial mass over an orbital period . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : stability ] , the mass transfer rate should scale as a high power of the degree of over - contact ( as the cube for an @xmath23 polytrope ) ; furthermore , for a case where @xmath26 , that is , the donor is initially the more massive star , the degree of over - contact will naturally increase with time as the star expands and its roche lobe shrinks .",
    "provided that such a binary system can begin mass - transfer , the amplitude of the mass transfer rate should inevitably reach values higher than indicated above .",
    "since motion of the center of mass of the binary system has been confined to a region well within a single computational grid cell even after @xmath345 orbits , we are confident that future evolutions can be followed with confidence through at least @xmath346 orbits , given sufficient computing resources . as discussed in the introduction of this paper",
    ", we understand that the mass transfer rates considered here are much larger than those found in what are considered typical examples of interacting binaries .",
    "the methods presented here are not applicable to the stable mass transfer observed in cataclysmic variables or other long lived systems , but should serve very well to investigate stages of evolution of their progenitors and transient events such as the onset of dynamical mass transfer and its stability .",
