    "these data show a clear distinction between the different substrates . to obtain estimates of the statistical parameters",
    "the distribution is considered to be approximately gaussian .",
    "the mean value of the distribution on hbn , @xmath8=1583.1  @xmath2 , is red shifted with respect to the one on sio@xmath1 , @xmath9=1585.9  @xmath2 , a notable deviation by almost three wavenumbers .",
    "even more pronounced is the difference in the standard deviation which is a measure for the g peak fluctuations . being @xmath10=0.7",
    "@xmath2 on hbn , it is almost four times smaller than on sio@xmath1 where @xmath11=2.7  @xmath2 .",
    "previous raman measurements with gated graphene flakes on sio@xmath1 have demonstrated a dependency of the g peak position on the charge carrier density  @xcite .",
    "a non - adiabatic theory was established to calculate the g - peak shift in terms of charge carrier densities  @xcite . by using a finite temperature of 295  k and an intrinsic g peak position of 1582.5  @xmath2 according to  @xcite",
    ", we obtain a charge carrier density of 1.8@xmath12  @xmath13 on sio@xmath1 and 9@xmath14  @xmath13 on hbn , meaning the overall doping of the investigated single - layer flake on hbn is reduced by a factor of two with respect to a region of the very same flake resting on sio@xmath1 .",
    "please note that the doping induced g - peak shifts are well consistent with the observed fwhms of the corresponding g - lines  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , using the standard deviation of the g - peak - shift distribution to quantify the charge fluctuations , one obtains a fluctuation of 1.6@xmath12  @xmath13 on sio@xmath1 and a fluctuation of 6@xmath14  @xmath13 on hbn .",
    "this difference by almost a factor of three indicates a significant reduction in doping domain fluctuations and hence a reduction of the disorder potential in the single - layer graphene on hbn . comparing these results with the data obtained by scanning tunneling spectroscopy  @xcite , one will notice a difference by one to two orders of magnitude",
    "however , the experiments using scanning tunneling spectroscopy , besides being carried out in a low temperature controlled environment , acquire data with an atomic resolution from an area of 100  nm@xmath15 which is on the scale of individual charge puddles , the raman setup with a spatial resolution of around 500  nm is capable of measuring on a micrometer scale averaging over a large number of charge puddles .",
    "for instance , the areas used to acquire the data on this sample are around 50  @xmath16m@xmath15 on sio@xmath1 and around 100  @xmath16m@xmath15 on hbn .    as shown in previous works , the reduced doping fluctuations are also manifested in a reduced ratio between the integrated peak intensities of the g and 2d peak  @xcite . the statistical distribution depicted in fig .",
    "3c shows a clear substrate dependency of this ratio and is in qualitative agreement with the g peak evaluation .",
    "experimental data of the statistics of the fwhm of the 2d - line is provided in fig .",
    "the mean values for the two substrates are clearly different and also the standard deviations differ .",
    "consistent with the two dimensional raman map shown before , the 2d peak width of the regions on hbn ( @xmath8=25.2  @xmath2 ) is significantly smaller by almost 10  @xmath2 than the one on sio@xmath1 ( @xmath9=34.5  @xmath2 ) .",
    "also the fluctuations of the hbn data , @xmath10=1.3  @xmath2 , are significantly smaller than the ones of the sio@xmath1 data , @xmath11=2.7  @xmath2 .",
    "so far , the fwhm of the 2d peak was not considered to be doping dependent .",
    "measurements of gated graphene on sio@xmath1 showed no significant dependence on the charge carrier density  @xcite .",
    "hence , a reduced doping alone can not explain this substrate dependence .",
    "a similar reduced line - width of the 2d - line ( 23 @xmath2 ) was observed for suspended graphene  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the increased fwhm for graphite on sio@xmath1 is due to the substrate roughness and the presence of impurities which gives rise to an enhanced electron scattering and thus a smaller life - time of the excited electronic states during the double - resonant raman process.@xcite",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the 2d - line position whose statistical distribution on hbn and on sio@xmath1 is shown in fig .  3b .",
    "while the position of the g - line can be directly related to the presence or absence of residual charging due to impurities on or in the substrate , the interpretation of the 2d - line shift is more subtle .",
    "small charge densities ( @xmath17 4@xmath1810@xmath19 @xmath13 ) lead to shifts of the 2d - line by at most 2 @xmath2 ( ref .  5 ) .",
    "furthermore , the 2d - line positions of suspended graphene  @xcite and graphene on hbn differ by almost 10 @xmath2 even though both systems are mostly free of charge impurities , as demonstrated by the coincidence of the g - line positions .",
    "thus , we discard charging as the origin for the 2d - line shift .    our interpretation of the 2d - line shift is based on the double - resonance raman model of thomsen and reich  @xcite .",
    "the model successfully describes the d and 2d dispersion as a function of laser energy as well as the splitting of the 2d - line for bilayer , and few - layer graphene  @xcite , provided that renormalization of the highest optical phonon branch ( hob ) due to electron - correlation effects is properly taken into account  @xcite .",
    "[ keepaspectratio = true , clip , width=0.72 ] fig04.eps    according to the double - resonance model , the 2d - line dispersion is proportional to the slope of the hob between the high - symmetry points k and m , and inversely proportional to the slope of the @xmath20 bands around k. in a first step , we thus calculated the electronic band structure and the phonon - dispersion of graphene on hbn using standard density - functional theory in the local density approximation ( dft - lda ) .",
    "we chose the most stable configuration where one carbon atom is on top of a boron atom and the other carbon atom in the hollow site of hbn  @xcite .",
    "in the electronic band - structure a small gap of 53 mev opens at k but further away from k , the @xmath20-bands remain almost unchanged  @xcite . in the phonon dispersion , calculated by density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt )  @xcite",
    ", there is only a small change of the hob in the immediate neighborhood around k. there , one observes a slight smearing of the kohn anomaly ( due to the very small band - gap opening ) , manifest in an up - shift of the hob by about 3  @xmath2 .",
    "everywhere else between k and m , in particular in the wave - vector range that is sampled in raman experiments , the upshift of the hob is less than 1  @xmath2 .",
    "we conclude that the pure `` mechanical '' interaction alone between graphene and the hbn substrate can not explain the blue - shift of the raman 2d - line  @xcite .    in recent work",
    ", it was shown by calculations on the level of the gw - approximation  @xcite that electronic correlation beyond dft - lda influences both the slope of the @xmath20-bands of graphene  @xcite and the slope of the highest - optical phonon branch around k  @xcite .",
    "the electron - electron interaction depends on the electronic screening by the environment .",
    "therefore , we expect that correlation effects in graphene will be reduced by a dielectric substrate . although sio@xmath1 and hbn have both roughly the same dielectric constant , the coupling between graphene and ultra - flat hbn is significantly increased compared to graphene on rough sio@xmath1 ( see also illustration in fig",
    "this different dielectric environment will have consequences for the fermi velocity and for the electron - phonon coupling . in order to verify this hypothesis ,",
    "we have performed gw - calculations on isolated ( suspended ) graphene and on graphene surrounded by two layers of hbn . the periodic geometry that we used in our calculations",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "4a . for simplicity",
    ", we have symmetrized the unit cell by choosing an abc stacking sequence for the three layers .",
    "this ensures that the two carbon atoms in the unit - cell are equivalent , each with a boron atom on one side and a hollow site on the other side . due to the symmetry",
    ", the linear crossing of the @xmath20-bands is preserved and we can use the same strategy as in ref .  31 for the calculation of the electron - phonon coupling at the high - symmetry point k : in the @xmath21 supercell , the atoms are displaced by a small distance ( @xmath22  atomic units ) from their equilibrium position along the eigenvector of the hob ( see fig .",
    "3b of ref .",
    "the squared electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling  which determines the slope of the hob around k  @xcite  is then obtained as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the induced energy gap between the @xmath25 and @xmath20 bands at k.    l | c | c | c    &    .calculated band - gap opening ( for a displacement @xmath26  ) and electron - phonon coupling of the highest optical ( @xmath27 ) phonon at k. comparison of lda and gw calculations .

    "the e - ph coupling is 3.7% weaker for graphene surrounded by hbn than for pure ( suspended ) graphene .",
    "this difference is increased to 8% on the level of the gw approximation .",
    "obviously , the increased screening by the hbn substrate reduces the gap opening and thus the e - ph coupling  @xcite .",
    "since the slope of the hob around k is proportional to the e - ph coupling  @xcite and since the frequency of the hob far away from k is almost independent of screening effects  @xcite , a reduction of the e - ph coupling leads to an increase of the hob frequency at and around k. this is demonstrated in fig .  4b . in order to quantitatively understand this effect",
    ", it would be desirable to calculate the exact phonon dispersion relation including correlation effects .",
    "due to the complexity of total - energy gw calculations , this is currently not feasible .",
    "a workaround consists in the use of the hybrid b3lyp functional  @xcite where we adjust the parameters in order to mimic the two different screening values for `` pure '' and `` sandwiched '' graphene ( see details in the appendix ) . using these functionals",
    ", we obtain that the hob shifts ( from `` pure '' to `` sandwiched '' graphene ) by + 16 @xmath2 at k , by + 2.4  @xmath2 at m , and by + 6.8  @xmath2 half - way between k and m ( which corresponds to a excitation energy of 2.8  ev ) . at the same time",
    ", the frequency at @xmath0 remains almost unchanged ( -0.4  @xmath2 ) .",
    "for the laser energy of 2.33  ev , linear interpolation yields a phonon shift of + 8.3  @xmath2 . the corresponding 2d - line shift ( where 2 phonons are excited / absorbed ) would be then + 16.6  @xmath2 .",
    "these calculations are not meant to provide absolute numbers for the 2d - line shift but they demonstrate that the experimentally measured 2d - line shift qualitatively agrees with the shift that is induced by the enhanced dielectric screening for graphene on hbn  @xcite .",
    "so far , we have compared a calculation for graphene surrounded by hbn with experiments where graphene is deposited on top of a hbn flake .",
    "this motivated us to perform raman measurements on graphene surrounded by hbn on both sides .",
    "we achieved this by the deposition of an additional multi - layer hbn flake on top of one of our graphene on hbn samples . the resulting raman spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "the spectrum displays three prominent peaks : the peak at 1367  @xmath2 is the e@xmath28-mode of hbn .",
    "the g - line of graphene at 1583.7  @xmath2 is approximately in the same position as the g - line of graphene with hbn on one side .",
    "this evidences that only a few additional charge impurities are added during the deposition of the top - hbn flake .",
    "in contrast to the g - line , the 2d - line of surrounded graphene around 2687.4  @xmath2 is considerably blue - shifted by 7  @xmath2 compared to the 2d - line of one - sided graphene on hbn as shown in fig .",
    "with respect to suspended graphene ( 2673.5  @xmath2 )  @xcite the blue - shift of the 2d - line of graphene on hbn roughly doubles when a second hbn - layer is added on top .",
    "this is another indication that the blue - shift has its origin in the screening dependence of the hob between k and m.",
    "our raman measurements confirm that hbn is a high - quality insulating substrate for graphene with strongly reduced impurity charging .",
    "this is evidenced by the red - shift of the g peak with respect to graphene on a standard sio@xmath1 substrate .",
    "in contrast to the g - line , the 2d - line of graphene on hbn is blue - shifted .",
    "we have shown that this change in the frequency of the highest - optical branch is not a consequence of a direct ( mechanical ) interaction between graphene and its substrate .",
    "it is rather an indirect , electronic , effect mediated by the influence of the dielectric screening on the electronic structure of graphene .",
    "usually , in three - dimensional metallic systems , the phonon - frequencies close to a kohn anomaly depend only on the _ internal _ screening of the ( bulk ) material .",
    "layered graphene is an example where ( close to the kohn anomaly at k ) , the frequencies of the highest optical branch depend on the _ external _ screening by the dielectric environment .",
    "this constitutes a new physical paradigm that is worthwhile to be investigated also in other layered materials .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling between the @xmath20-bands and the highest optical branch around @xmath3 can also impose a limitation on the conductivity of graphene in the high current - limit @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dielectric screening of electron - phonon coupling in 2-dimensional layered materials can play a general role for transport in layered materials .",

    "however , if one takes into account the effects of e - e interaction for the quasi - particle band structure , one should also take into account excitonic effects during the optical excitation of electron - hole ( e - h ) pairs .",
    "the increased dielectric screening , which reduces the e - e interaction , also reduces the e - h interaction .",
    "thus the two effects tend to cancel each other and we assume that the fermi - velocity reduction has a negligible influence on the raman 2d - line position .          a detailed discussion of the 2d - line width is beyond the scope of this work . for a discussion of line - width and line - shape , we refer the reader to the work of berciaud et al.@xcite on suspended graphene .",

    "<S> we show that screening by the dielectric substrate reduces the electron - phonon coupling at the high - symmetry point k and leads to an up - shift of the raman 2d - line . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the observation of a kohn anomaly that can be tuned by screening . </S>",
