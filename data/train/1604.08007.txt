    "west nile virus(wnv ) is a mosquito - borne that belongs to the encephalitis virus group within the family flaviviridae @xcite .",
    "it first appeared in the united states in 1999 , reached pennsylvania ( pa ) in 2000 , and has since spread across pa as well as the rest of the united states .",
    "wnv has developed of a national donor testing program so far .",
    "it infects various mammal species specially horses and humans ; however , the most commonly wnv infected animals are birds that serves as the reservoir host , the main path of wnv transmission is by the bite of an infected mosquitoes whose the salivary fluid @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the natural pathway of the virus is from bird to mosquito to bird ; therefore wnv is primarily spread by migrating birds , dispersal of resident birds , mosquito movement , or human transportation of mosquitos , birds and animals @xcite .",
    "millions of birds have died from wnv and for some species and locales , more than 50 percent of the population has perished .",
    "at least seven species of birds , all of whom are residents in pa , have suffered serious declines in population because of wnv @xcite .",
    "much has been done in terms of modeling and analysis of transmission dynamics of wnv , see , for example , bowman et al.@xcite has proposed a mathematical modelling and analysis to assess two main anti - wnv preventive strategies , namely : mosquito reduction strategies and personal protection , similarly , @xcite .",
    "fan et al . have considered the effect of temperature on the transmission of the virus spread in @xcite .",
    "taking effective measures to curb the rage of wnv is self - evident .",
    "the more ordinary strategies incorporate the way of culling mosquitoes seeing in @xcite , which was considered the strategy of implementing periodic culling of mosquitoes at critical times , namely , the control of wnv with fixed moments , such that the death rate of mosquito was enhanced .",
    "popular tactics were adopted to control the reproduction rate of mosquito by the sterile insect technique which has also been applied to reduce or eradicate the wild mosquitoes .",
    "for example , utilizing radical or other chemical or physical methods , male mosquitoes are genetically modified to be sterile so that they are incapable of producing offspring despite being sexually active in @xcite .",
    "zhang et al . @xcite put forward periodic patterns and pareto efficiency of state dependent impulsive controls regulating interactions between wild and transgenic mosquito populations looking on the total size of the wild and transgenic mosquito populations as threshold value .",
    "certain sufficient conditions for the existence and orbital stability of positive order-1 periodic solution of the model with state - dependent impulsive perturbations were attained .",
    "a question arises about how much the density of infected birds should be cured in combination with pesticide release in order to effectively control the spread of wnv . to address this question , which is the aim of this paper , we formulate a model for the interaction between mosquitoes and birds based on a three - dimensional ode system with state - dependent impulsive perturbations .",
    "the state - dependent impulsive model is proposed for intergrated pest management such that the pest of the population size is no larger than its economic threshold(et ) in @xcite and the existence and stability of the order-1 periodic solution are given .",
    "nie et al .",
    "@xcite employed the strategies of state dependent pulse vaccination in epidemic model which is more suitable to actual circumstances .",
    "what s more , a microbial pesticide model with impulsive state feedback control was proposed in @xcite and so on .    motivated by the above - mentioned considerations and by the ideas of @xcite .",
    "we formulate a model for the interaction between mosquitoes and birds based on a three - dimensional ode system which is subject to state - dependent impulsive peturations .",
    "this paper is structed as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we formulate mathematical model considering state - dependent pesticide sprays and curing the infected birds as control measures and take into account the generalized planar impulsive system .",
    "section 3 , the qualitative analysis of the system without impulsive effect is given .",
    "section 4 , we investigate the existence and stability of the order-@xmath0 periodic solution in different cases . in order to asses",
    "the control strategy , sensitivity analysis is applied to study the contribution of each parameter on the disease transmission in section 5 .",
    "finally , we give brief discussions on our findings .",
    "a schematic description of the traditional wnv model from vector mosquitoes to birds can be depicted in figure 1(a ) . here , the total female mosquito population is split into the populations of susceptible ( @xmath1 ) and infected ( @xmath2 ) mosquitoes , and the total bird population ( @xmath3 ) is divide into the susceptible ( @xmath4 ) and infected ( @xmath5 ) birds .",
    "however , in a real world application , it is very difficult to distinguish from susceptible and infected mosquitoes .",
    "additionally , george et al .",
    "@xcite estimated the impact of wnv on the survival of avian populations and find that populations were negatively affected by wnv in 23 of the 49 species studied ( 47% ) .",
    "based on these , it is reasonable to simplify the transmission rules of wnv from the flow chart figure 1(a ) to figure 1(b ) for an analysis of mathematical reasoning . in it , we classify female mosquitoes and birds into three subclass : female mosquitoes ( @xmath6 ) , susceptible birds ( @xmath4 ) and infected birds ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "further , in order to control the transmission of wnv , it s essential to reduce the quantities of infected birds and mosquitoes .",
    "due to the consideration of environmental protection and economic support , the effective and easily implemented control strategies are only applied when the quantity of the infected birds reaches a hazardous threshold value but not at any state . to achieve this objective ,",
    "a host vector dynamics model with state dependent impulsive control strategies for the transmission of wnv reads @xmath7 the means of model as follows : when the quantity of infected bird @xmath5 reaches the critical threshold value @xmath8 at time @xmath9 at the @xmath10-th time , control measures ( such as soluble powder drug blend in daily birds drinking water or breeders can feed grain which has been soaked in liquid medicine to birds , spraying pesticides to reduce the quantity of mosquitoes ) are taken , then the quantities of mosquitoes , susceptible and infected birds immediately become @xmath11 , @xmath12 and@xmath13 , respectively . the parameters and variables of the model",
    "are described in table [ table1 ] .",

    "we might as well set @xmath32 .",
    "model is equivalent to the following simplified model @xmath33    the global existence and uniqueness of solution for model is guaranteed by the smoothness of the right - hand sides of model . for more details , we refer to @xcite .",
    "to discuss model , the generalized planar impulsive semi - dynamical systems with state - dependent feedback control can be firstly introduced as follows :    letting @xmath34 is the phase set ( i.e. for any @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , and @xmath37 . obviously , system ( [ system-2 ] ) is generally known as a planar impulsive semi - dynamical system , where impulsive set @xmath38 is a subset of @xmath39 and continuous function @xmath40 it follows that the phase set is @xmath41    for any @xmath42 , we define the positive orbit as follows @xmath43    we mainly discuss the existence of periodic solution of model by the existence criteria of the general impulsive autonomous system . before introducing the existence criteria , we introduce and quote some topological definitions about impulsive differential equations as following , more details to see @xcite .",

    "we find that the maximum amplitude of the number of infected birds @xmath5 dramatically decreased and the periodic of infected birds reach the threshold value @xmath304 obviously prolonged , when @xmath30 increased in figure [ fig.7(a ) ] . from figure [ fig.7(b ) ] , we draw that the maximum amplitude of the number of infected birds @xmath5 did not change , when @xmath28 increased . further , we show that the periodic of infected birds extanded as the cofficient(@xmath30 ) of curing infected birds increased . therefore , the culling of mosquitoes @xmath28 and @xmath30 play an important role in controling the length of time in infected birds .",
