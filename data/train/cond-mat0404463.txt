    "quantum spin systems exhibit various interesting properties . they have been studied extensively .",
    "one example of interesting spin systems is a one - dimensional spin-1/2 heisenberg system with first- and second - nearest - neighbor interactions whose hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath9 here @xmath10 is a spin-1/2 operator at the @xmath11th site , and @xmath7 or @xmath8 is a first - nearest - neighbor ( 1nn ) or second - nearest - neighbor ( 2nn ) exchange interaction constant . when @xmath8 is positive ( antiferromagnetic ; af ) , competition between the two interactions occurs irrespective of the sign of @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , intriguing phenomena are expected to appear .",
    "we label the spin system expressed by eq .",
    "( 1 ) with positive @xmath8 as a competing system in this article .",
    "the competing system has been investigated theoretically over many years . when both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are af , the ground state is a spin - liquid state .",
    "a spin gap opens between the spin - singlet ground and excited states when @xmath12 exceeds a critical value @xmath13.@xcite at present , @xmath13 is evaluated as @xmath14.@xcite the exact ground state is obtained when @xmath15.@xcite the ground state is expressed by products of singlet pairs formed between nearest - neighbor spins .",
    "it has twofold degeneracy .",
    "when @xmath7 is negative ( ferromagnetic ; f ) and @xmath8 is af , the ground state is the ferromagnetic state for @xmath16 and an incommensurate state with @xmath17 for @xmath18.@xcite here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the total spin and its @xmath21-component .",
    "when @xmath18 , it has been suggested that the gap is strongly reduced to the extent that the gap is too small for observation by any numerical method.@xcite the exact ground state is obtained when @xmath22 , according to hamada et al.@xcite a state with @xmath17 and @xmath23 states with @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( ferromagnetic states ) are degenerate in energy and become the ground state .",
    "the state with @xmath17 is expressed by a linear combination of states of products of all singlet pairs which are distributed uniformly on all lattice sites .",
    "hamada et al .",
    "called this state the uniformly distributed resonating valence bond ( udrvb ) state .",
    "the spin - singlet ground state at @xmath18 approaches the udrvb state in the limit of @xmath26.@xcite sun _ et al . _ have conjectured the existence of a new phase in the region of @xmath27 where the ground state is incommensurate and has a nonzero total spin magnitude ( partially ferromagnetic polarized state).@xcite    the first realization of the competing system is the spin - peierls cuprate cugeo@xmath1 .",
    "the first paper reporting the appearance of the spin - peierls transition,@xcite indicated that magnetic susceptibility of cugeo@xmath1 does not agree with the calculated susceptibility of a one - dimensional spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic system . at first , this discrepancy had not been solved by experimental work on magnetic properties of pure and doped cugeo@xmath1.@xcite afterward , the possibility of existence of antiferromagnetic @xmath8 in addition to antiferromagnetic @xmath7 was suggested.@xcite the calculated susceptibility of the competing system with antiferromagnetic @xmath7 and @xmath8 was sufficient to explain the experimental one.@xcite until now , several model compounds of the competing system have been found.@xcite they are summarized in table i. nevertheless , in compounds with antiferromagnetic @xmath7 , the spin gap expected in the case that @xmath28 has not been confirmed experimentally . in compounds with",
    "ferromagnetic @xmath7 already reported , values of @xmath6 imply that the ground state is incommensurate .",
    "these compounds are not suitable for study of the incommensurate ground state because antiferromagnetic long - range order appears at low temperature .",
    "therefore , discovery of further model compounds is desired because it expands experimental studies on the competing system and stimulates further theoretical interest .",
    "a typical example is development of understanding of quantum spin systems after the observation of the spin - peierls transition in cugeo@xmath1.@xcite    we have investigated several cuprates having spiral or zigzag chains of cu@xmath29 ions ( @xmath30 ) in order to find model compounds including the competing system .",
    "recently , we reported cu@xmath31ge@xmath31o@xmath32-@xmath33h@xmath34o ( @xmath35 ) as one model compound.@xcite this cuprate has spiral chains of cu@xmath29 ions .",
    "the chains are coupled to one another by an interchain exchange interaction .",
    "magnetic susceptibility of cu@xmath31ge@xmath31o@xmath32-@xmath33h@xmath34o above af transition temperature ( @xmath36 ) was consistent with susceptibility obtained from the competing system with antiferromagnetic @xmath7 , but an af transition occurred at low temperature .",
    "in addition , we obtained an experimental result suggesting the existence of a spin gap , but we were unable to prove it because of an af transition . in this article , we will show that rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 , which has zigzag chains of cu@xmath29 ions , is a model compound including the competing system with ferromagnetic @xmath7 .

    "solodovnikov and solodovnikova first synthesized rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 and determined its crystal structure.@xcite the space group is monoclinic c2/c ( no .",

    "there are two crystallographic cu sites .",
    "slightly distorted chains formed by edge - shared cuo@xmath43 octahedra parallel to the @xmath44 axis correspond to @xmath30 zigzag chains .",
    "the 1nn cu - cu bond in the chains ( bold bars in fig .",
    "1 ) has a slight alternation : a cu - cu distance is 3.08   and cu - o - cu angles are 90.1 and 102.0@xmath45 in one bond ; and the distance is 3.09   and the angles are 92.0 and 101.2@xmath45 in the other bond .",
    "we assume that the exchange interactions in these bonds @xmath7 are the same because the difference in the distances and angles between the two bonds is small .",
    "as shown later , experimental results and calculated ones based on this assumption are not mutually contradictory .",
    "the sign of @xmath7 can not be determined from the crystal structure because both cases are allowed in such cu - o - cu angles . because the cu - o - cu angle is in the vicinity of 90@xmath45 , the exchange interaction in the 2nn cu - cu bonds @xmath8 ( thin bars in fig . 1 ;",
    "5.10  ) in the chains is expected to exist through cu - o - o - cu paths like the spin - peierls compound cugeo@xmath1 . according to theoretical results of mizuno et al.,@xcite the sign of @xmath8",
    "is presumed to be af . on the other hand ,",
    "cu - cu distances in the other bonds except for the 1nn bond are larger than 4.90  .",
    "the cu - o - cu or cu - o - o - cu paths bringing magnetic interactions with magnitude comparable to @xmath7 or @xmath8 are not expected in these bonds .",
    "consequently , rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 is probably a model compound including the competing system that is represented schematically in fig .",
    "crystalline powder of rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 was synthesized by solid - state reaction method . a stoichiometric mixture of rb@xmath0co@xmath1 ( 2n purity ) ,",
    "cuo ( 4n purity ) , and moo@xmath1 ( 5n purity ) was sintered at 733 k for 260 h in air with intermittent regrinding .",
    "we measured x - ray diffraction patterns at room temperature .",
    "the main phase is rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 , but a small amount of rb@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath46 ( nonmagnetic ) was detected .",
    "therefore , a small amount of cuo ( antiferromagnet ) probably exists , but peaks of cuo are not observed as independent peaks .",
    "notwithstanding , effects of the impurities are negligible because the magnetic susceptibility of rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 is much larger than those of the impurities .",
    "dependence of magnetic susceptibility [ @xmath47 on temperature ( @xmath48 ) was measured using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer ( mpmsx l ; quantum design ) .",
    "dependence of magnetization [ @xmath49 on the magnetic field ( @xmath50 ) was measured using an extraction - type magnetometer in @xmath50 up to 30 t induced by a hybrid magnet at the high magnetic field center , nims .",
    "electron spin resonance ( esr ) measurements were performed using an x - band spectrometer ( jes - re3x ; jeol ) at room temperature with a typical resonance frequency of 9.46 ghz .",
    "the powder - averaged gyromagnetic ratio of cu@xmath29 ( @xmath51 ) was 2.03 .",
    "we calculated all energy levels in the competing system with @xmath52 under the periodic boundary condition by means of exact diagonalization .",
    "we then calculated dependence of magnetic susceptibility on temperature and dependence of magnetization on the magnetic field .",
    "details of the calculation method are described in ref .",
    "the solid curve in fig . 2 represents magnetic susceptibility @xmath53 of rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 powder measured in @xmath54 t. the susceptibility",
    "is defined as @xmath55 . as will be shown later in fig . 4",
    ", @xmath56 is linearly proportional to @xmath50 below 1 t. we can see a broad maximum around @xmath57 k in the experimental @xmath53 .",
    "the susceptibility decreases with a decrease in @xmath48 at low temperature , but the susceptibility does not appear to reach 0 at 0 k. no magnetic phase transition is detected to 2 k. the broad maximum does not mean occurrence of an af transition because @xmath53 at 2 k is smaller than half of @xmath53 at @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) . in an af transition , on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath53 at sufficiently small @xmath48 is about two thirds of @xmath53 at af transition temperature @xmath36 in powder samples .",
    "therefore , the broad maximum suggests existence of a low - dimensional af spin system .",
    "the three dashed curves show calculated @xmath53 of the competing system .",
    "parameters are @xmath60 k and @xmath61 for curve 1 ( the bonner - fisher curve ) , and @xmath62 k and @xmath63 for curve 2 . for curves 1 and 2 ,",
    "the values of @xmath7 are determined such that @xmath58 of the experimental @xmath53 agrees with that of the calculated @xmath53 .",
    "curve 3 is explained later . in all three calculated curves ,",
    "the @xmath51 value is 2.03 , and the value of the other parts ( @xmath64 ) of susceptibility , except for spin susceptibility , is assumed to be @xmath65 ( emu / cu mol ) .",
    "curves 1 and 2 do not agree with the experimental @xmath53 . because temperature dependence of calculated @xmath53 becomes weak with an increase in @xmath6 for @xmath66 , the competing system with @xmath66 can not explain the experimental @xmath53 .",
    "similarly , the competing system with @xmath67 does not reproduce @xmath53 of rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 because calculated @xmath53 decreases by introduction of @xmath7 to two decoupled af chains formed by @xmath8.@xcite the fact that the calculated @xmath53 of the competing system with antiferromagnetic @xmath7 are smaller than the experimental @xmath53 suggests the existence of ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "in addition , as mentioned above , @xmath8 is considered to be af .",
    "consequently , a remaining possibility is the case that @xmath7 is f and @xmath8 is af .    in order to confirm whether the experimental @xmath53 can be explained by the competing system with ferromagnetic @xmath7 and antiferromagnetic @xmath8 , we calculated susceptibility . figure 3 shows examples where @xmath68 and @xmath69 . as described later , the calculated @xmath53 with @xmath68 is consistent with the experimental @xmath53 . when @xmath70 , susceptibilities of @xmath69 agree with one another , indicating the susceptibility of @xmath71",
    "on the other hand , susceptibility at @xmath72 does not converge .",
    "we performed finite - size scaling to estimate the susceptibility of @xmath71 , but failed to estimate it .",
    "the ground state of the competing system at @xmath18 is incommensurate .",
    "for that reason , we infer that @xmath73 is insufficient to obtain susceptibility at low temperature .",
    "therefore , we compare the experimental susceptibility with the calculated one at @xmath70 . we could not determine the value of @xmath58 in our calculation .",
    "however , a broad maximum in susceptibility of the competing system exists , as indicated by a broad maximum that is visible in the susceptibility that was calculated by another group.@xcite therefore , existence of the broad maximum in @xmath53 of rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 is consistent with the calculated result in the competing system .",
    "we compared the experimental @xmath53 with the calculated @xmath53 , but we were unable to determine values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 uniquely in susceptibility .",
    "for that reason , we evaluated those values through comparison between experimental and calculated magnetization .",
    "figure 4 shows magnetization at 2.6 k. the experimental @xmath56 indicated by the dashed curve starts to be saturated around 14 t , but is not saturated perfectly until 30 t. dotted and solid curves represent calculated @xmath56 of @xmath74 or 16 when @xmath3 k and @xmath68 .",
    "in contrast to susceptibility at low temperature , convergence of the calculated magnetization is sufficient at @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , we considered a calculated curve with @xmath73 agrees with magnetization of the infinite chain .",
    "consistency between the experimental and calculated @xmath56 is well below 12 t. on the other hand , above 12 t , deviation appears between the experimental and calculated @xmath56 .",
    "this deviation can not be explained by @xmath76 with @xmath77 ( emu / cu mol ) indicated by the dash - dotted curve in fig .",
    "4 because the slope of the experimental @xmath56 above 14 t in the unit of emu / cu mol is ten times larger than @xmath64 .",
    "this deviation is probably caused by other interactions aside from @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we also calculated magnetization with @xmath60 k and @xmath61 or @xmath62 k and @xmath63 ( not shown ) . calculated susceptibility with these values",
    "was shown in fig . 2 and did not agree with the experimental susceptibility .",
    "the calculated magnetization is not saturated even at 30 t and is much different from the experimental magnetization .",
    "we investigated whether the competing system with @xmath3 k and @xmath68 could also explain the experimental @xmath53 .",
    "calculated @xmath53 with these values is shown in fig . 2 by the dashed curve 3 .",
    "it agrees well with the experimental @xmath53 in the compared region . as a result ,",
    "susceptibility and magnetization suggest that rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 is a model compound of the competing system with ferromagnetic 1nn and antiferromagnetic 2nn interactions . from the value of @xmath6 ,",
    "the ground state of the spin system in rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 is an incommensurate state with @xmath17 .",
    "there is a strongly reduced spin gap that is too small to be observed using any numerical method .",
    "the small susceptibility at low temperature in comparison with @xmath59 may reflect the ground state and very small spin gap .",
    "discrepancy between the experimental and calculated @xmath53 may appear at lower temperature , which is probably attributable to other interactions aside from @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we measured temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and magnetic - field dependence of magnetization of rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 powder .",
    "comparison of experimental and calculated results revealed that this cuprate is a model compound of a one - dimensional spin-1/2 heisenberg system with ferromagnetic first - nearest - neighbor and antiferromagnetic second - nearest - neighbor competing interactions ( competing system ) .",
    "the values of the exchange interactions were evaluated as @xmath3 k and @xmath4 k ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath6 indicates that the ground state is a spin - singlet incommensurate state .",
    "no magnetically ordered phase was observed down to 2 k , which is much smaller than the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast , other model compounds of the competing system with ferromagnetic @xmath7 exhibit an af transition .",
    "therefore , rb@xmath0cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 is a most suitable material to investigate the incommensurate ground state that is expected theoretically , but unconfirmed experimentally in the competing system .",
    "future studies must address internal magnetic fields at low temperature by nmr or @xmath79sr measurements and low - lying excited states by neutron - scattering measurements .",
