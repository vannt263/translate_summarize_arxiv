    "a quantum state is subjected to decoherence due to the interaction with the environment .",
    "the quantum error correction codes can suppress the decoherence by encoding the logical qubit in multiple physical qubits and performing sufficient measurements and correction operations @xcite .",
    "another strategy is to rely on the so - called decoherence - free subspace which requires the interaction hamiltonian to have some appropriate symmetry @xcite .",
    "quantum zeno effect@xcite and dynamical decoupling @xcite have also been discussed to protect the quantum state .",
    "amplitude damping is one important type of decoherence which is related to many practical qubit systems @xcite .",
    "for example , it can happen to a photon qubit in a leaky cavity , or atomic qubit subjected to spontaneous decay , or a superconduction qubit with zero - temperature energy relaxation .",
    "recently , it is shown that weak measurement together with bit flip can recover a quantum state from amplitude damping @xcite .",
    "another way to restore a qubit state in a weak measurement is using hadamard and cnot gates with auxiliary qubits @xcite . in this way",
    ", no weak measurement is required in the reversal process , and hence the reversal time can be shorter .    quantum entanglement , which is a critical resource of the quantum information and quantum computation , also decreases due to the amplitude damping .",
    "al _ first showed that weak measurement together with bit flip can also protect the quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "the decoherence can be largely suppressed by uncollapsing the quantum state toward ground state before the amplitude damping @xcite .",
    "these ideas were recently implemented in a proof - of - principle experiment @xcite .    in this paper , we show that , following the approach presented in @xcite , an arbitrary two - qubit pure state under amplitude damping in a weak measurement can also be probabilistically recovered using hadamard and cnot gates with auxiliary qubits . furthermore , even without weak measurement , quantum entanglement of a two - qubit system under amplitude damping can also be partially protected using our scheme .",
    "we also propose a proof - of - principle experiment for this scheme based on linear optical system .",
    "besides , we can extend our scheme to suppress the decoherence even better by uncollapsing the quantum state of the system toward the ground state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly introduce the weak measurement and amplitude damping . in sec .",
    "iii we show that a pure two - qubit state that has undergone a weak measurement can be recovered using hadamard and cnot gates with auxiliary qubits . in sec .",
    "iv we show that quantum entanglement between two qubits that has undergone amplitude damping can be partially recovered using the same procedure as presented in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "v we propose a linear optical experiment to implement our scheme . in sec .",
    "iv , we present an extended scheme to protect entanglement with better efficiency . in sec .",
    "vii we discuss the fidelity of the recovered entangled state .",
    "finally we summarize the result .",
    "as opposed to a typical von neumann quantum measurement , complete collapse to an eigenstate does not occur in a weak measurement @xcite .",
    "an example of the weak measurement is the leakage of the field inside a cavity .",
    "suppose that the quantum state of a field in a cavity is a supperposition of zero and one photon states , i.e. , @xmath0 with @xmath1 .",
    "let us assume that an ideal detector is placed outside the cavity .",
    "if the detector registers a click , the quantum state of the field collapses to @xmath2 .",
    "however , if no click happens , the quantum state does not collapse but is reduced to @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the cavity decay rate . the amplitude of the one photon state is damped .",
    "more generally , an amplitude damping of a single qubit can be described by the following mapping @xcite : @xmath5 $ ] is the possibility of decaying of the excited state , @xmath6 and s ( e ) denotes the system ( environment ) . within the weisskopf - wigner approximation , the probability of finding the atom in the excited state decreases exponentially with time and we have @xmath7 .    in a weak measurement ,",
    "if a detector gets a null - result , we have the following mapping : @xmath8 iii .",
    "two - qubit state recovery in a weak measurment --------------------------------------------------    in this section , we consider an arbitrary two - qubit pure state which is given by @xmath9    when this state undergoes amplitude damping , the amplitudes are modified .",
    "we consider two situations : in this section , we consider the case when we get a null - result for the weak measurement and the system evolves according to the mapping eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "in the next section we will consider the case when the two - qubit state undergoes a general amplitude damping which is described by eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "when we get a null result in the amlitude damping , the system evolves according to the mappings in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the normalization factor .        to recover the damped quantum state back to the initial quantum state",
    ", we use the circuit diagram shown in fig . 1 .",
    "two auxiliary qubits are needed in this scheme .",
    "initially , these two ancillas are both in the @xmath12 state .",
    "first we apply a hadamard gate with angle @xmath13 for each ancilla @xmath14 the combined system is given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] if @xmath13 is chosen to be @xmath16 , the combined state becomes eq .",
    "next we measure the ancilla qubits . from eq .",
    "( 9 ) we see that if we get @xmath54 result the quantum state of the system reduces to @xmath99 where the normalization factor @xmath100 .",
    "we add an ancilla qubit which is initially in @xmath27 state . after applying hadamard gate with angle @xmath101 ,",
    "the combined state becomes @xmath102 it follows , on applying cnot gate on the second qubit and the ancilla , we obtain the state @xmath103 this state can be rewritten as the state in eq .",
    "( 9 ) and we have some probability to recover back the initial state .",
    "next we calculate the success probability .",
    "first the probability of the null result weak measurement for the quantum state in eq .",
    "( 5 ) is given by @xmath104 . from eq .",
    "( 10 ) , we see that the probability to get the outcomes @xmath105 are @xmath106 respectively , where we neglect the normalization factors in the medium stages because they can alway be canceled out when we calculate the success probability .",
    "the success probability for only one recovery procedure is given by @xmath107 if we get @xmath54 or @xmath108 result , we can do additional recovery procedure and from eq .",
    "( 9 ) we can see that the success probability is @xmath109 where @xmath28 . if we get the outcome @xmath110 ,",
    "we repeat the recovery procedure and the success probability is @xmath111 .",
    "thus the success probability for two recovery procedures is given by @xmath112 similarly , for three recovery procedures , the success probability is given by @xmath113.\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the probability that we get the outcome @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) . in principle",
    "we can calculate the success probability for any number of repeating procedure .",
    "however , in practice we need only about three repeating times because the success probability increases by very small amount for repeating procedures @xmath115 .",
    "the quantum state after the amplitude damping is given by eq . ( 11 ) .",
    "we add two ancilla qubits which are initially in the @xmath27 state . after applying the hadamard gates and cnot gates ,",
    "the state of the system becomes @xmath116 if we measure the ancilla qubits and the outcome is @xmath117 with @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath119 where we neglect the normalization factor . after tracing out the environment the density matrix of the system",
    "is given by eq .",
    "( 12 ) .    if we get other results we can do additional procedure to protect the entanglement .",
    "for example if we get @xmath54 result , we add an additional qubit for second qubit . in the recovery procedure ,",
    "the state evolves as @xmath120 where we have chosen @xmath121 in the last equation .",
    "we can see that if we measure @xmath27 for the ancilla qubit the quantum state of the system returns back to the result given by eq .",
    "if we trace out the environment the quantum state of the system is given by eq .",
    "if we measure @xmath2 for the ancilla qubit we just repeat the same procedure with @xmath122 .",
    "on comparing eq . ( 5 ) and eq . (",
    "17 ) , we note the following changes : @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .",
    "therefor , using the same recovery procedure we get the combined quantum state similar to eqs . ( 28)-(31 ) but with @xmath59 replaced by @xmath126 , @xmath127 by @xmath128 , and @xmath129 by @xmath130 . if our measurement outcome is @xmath53 , we obtain @xmath131 if we choose @xmath13 such that @xmath80 where @xmath132 , we have @xmath133 on comparing this quantum state with eq . ( 36 ) , we can see that the only difference is that @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( 36 ) is replaced by @xmath134 here .",
    "therefore , after tracing out the environment the density matrix in eq .",
    "( 19 ) is different from eq .",
    "( 13 ) by replacing @xmath40 with @xmath134 .",
    "we can also notice similar changes for the concurrences ( eqs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 20 ) ) and fidelities ( eqs .",
    "( 23 ) and ( 24 ) ) .",
