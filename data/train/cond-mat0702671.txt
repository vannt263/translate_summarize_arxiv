    "materials as diverse as molecular liquids , foams and granular matter experience a transition from a fluid - like state to a solid - like state characterized only by a sudden arrest of their dynamics .",
    "it has been proposed that the phenomena associated with this dynamical arrest can be explained within the unified framework of a jamming phase diagram  @xcite . unlike thermal phase transitions , jamming does not seem to be characterized by singularities in any purely static , structural property  @xcite .",
    "numerous experiments and simulations indicate the appearance of large - scale dynamical heterogeneities and an associated growing dynamical length scale . in colloids near the glass transition , for example , fast - moving particles were observed to be spatially correlated with a characteristic cluster size that increased as the glass transition was approached  @xcite . in supercooled liquids ,",
    "spatial inhomogeneities can be identified via a time - dependent four - point ( two - time , two - space ) correlation function  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on molecular liquids and colloids have identified a growing dynamical length scale near the glass transition via new multipoint dynamic susceptibilities  @xcite . in granular materials , spatial structures",
    "have been directly observed in experiments on flowing systems  @xcite .",
    "more recently , measurements of velocity correlations in the surface layer of particles flowing down an inclined plane have yielded a length scale which appears to grow as the flow is arrested  @xcite .",
    "while detection of such dynamical heterogeneities in numerical studies has been more difficult , extended chains of particles experiencing high frequency collisions are visible in event - driven simulations of gravity driven granular flow  @xcite .",
    "these structures experience a slow relaxation from collisional stress at intermediate time scales in a manner analogous to temporal relaxations observed in glassy systems at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "there is also some evidence for the existence of large - scale structure in images of the contact force network in simulations of chute flow  @xcite .",
    "several questions naturally arise : ( 1 ) are dynamical heterogeneities a necessary precursor to dynamical arrest of the jamming kind ? ( 2 ) do these heterogeneities and their mesoscopic scale lead to any kind of universal dynamical behavior irrespective of significant differences in microscopic dynamics ? ( 3 ) do static structures such as force chains observed in jammed granular packings emerge out of dynamical heterogeneities ?    in the present work we address these questions via a simplified model which focuses on the essential effects of driving and dissipation in a flowing granular system .",
    "simulations have been performed of a two - dimensional gravity driven system of frictionless bidisperse hard disks in a hopper geometry .",
    "the disks undergo instantaneous , inelastic binary collisions and propagate under gravity in between collisions ; a driven , dissipative system that is very different from supercooled molecular liquids .",
    "previous work  @xcite has shown that this minimal model still reproduces observable results from related experimental systems  @xcite . to investigate the relevant time and length scales governing the dynamics of the granular system ,",
    "an interesting analysis for quantifying dynamical heterogeneity in non - equilibrium systems  @xcite independent of the microscopic interactions between particles is employed .",
    "specifically , measurements of the time @xmath1 required for a particular particle to move a specified distance @xmath2 , provide an appealing physical picture of large - scale correlated regions with characteristic timescales chosen from a broad distribution . through a coarsegraining scheme first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite which exploits the fact that the visible heterogeneity is maximized at a particular distance @xmath3 , both the distance @xmath3 ( which can be associated with average cage size ) and the spatial extent of the correlated regions @xmath4 are extracted in a completely threshold - independent way .",
    "@xmath3 can then be used to explore the effect of complex collective behaviour on dynamic properties such as the average mean squared displacement @xmath5 .",
    "the grain dynamics used in the simulations are similar to ref .",
    "specifically , ( i ) at each interparticle collision , momentum is conserved but the collisions are inelastic so the relative normal velocity is reduced by the coefficient of restitution @xmath6 ; ( ii ) to allow the side walls to absorb some vertical momentum we impose the condition that collisions with the walls are inelastic with a coefficient of restitution @xmath7 in the direction tangential to the wall and ( iii ) since we wish to observe the system over many events , particles exiting the system at the bottom must be replaced at the top to create uniform , sustained flow .",
    "note that collisions are instantaneous and in between collisions the particles are driven by gravity . to avoid the phenomena of inelastic collapse the coefficients of restitution @xmath6 and @xmath7 are velocity dependent ; if the relative normal velocity between particles or between a given particle and the wall is less than some cutoff @xmath8 then the collision is presumed to be elastic  @xcite .",
    "the flow velocity @xmath9 is controlled by adjusting the width of the hopper opening .",
    "we also introduce a probability of reflection @xmath10 at the bottom which reduces the time needed to reach steady - state flow .",
    "typically , our simulations were done on bidisperse systems ( diameter ratio 1:1.2 ) of 1000 disks , with @xmath6 = 0.8 , @xmath7 = 0.5 , @xmath8 = @xmath11 and @xmath10 = 0.5 .",
    "the simulation was run for a total time of @xmath12 in simulation time units ( smaller particle diameter @xmath13 , smaller particle mass @xmath14 and gravitational constant @xmath15 are all set to 1 ) with the initial time interval of @xmath16 discarded before recording data to ensure the system has reached steady state . during the total time interval of @xmath17 over which we are evaluating the data , a given particle will pass through the hopper 5 - 10 times depending on the flow velocity .",
    "subdiffusive behavior and caging have become hallmarks of the jamming transition , but defining a quantitative measure for these processes which is sensitive to the presence of dynamical heterogeneity has been difficult . the following observation suggests a possible procedure for defining a characteristic time for a particular particle which may detect the presence of any spatial heterogeneity in the dynamics : if the relaxation time @xmath18 of a given particle @xmath19 is defined as the time required for particle @xmath19 to travel a distance @xmath2 , then any spatial correlation in @xmath18 ( given initial positions of the particles ) will depend very strongly on the chosen value of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath2 is small , then it is not possible to distinguish between those particles which are simply rattling back and forth within some confined distance and those which may have some enhanced motility . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath2 is too large , then a given particle @xmath19 may have been in regions where the local average relaxation time has taken on many values , both fast and slow . in both cases ,",
    "a spatial map of the relaxation time reveals no clear positional correlation in regions of @xmath18 beyond some small length scale associated with random clumping ( fig .",
    "[ fig : taur]a and c , respectively ) .    however , at some intermediate value of @xmath2 , it should be possible to distinguish between localized motion and extended translational motion prior to a `` washing - out '' of any spatial correlations between particles with similar relaxation times ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : taur]b , where @xmath20 to fig .",
    "[ fig : taur]a and c , and note the clearer distinction between regions with different @xmath18 ) .",
    "presumably there is some optimal value @xmath3 at which the visible heterogeneity in @xmath1 is maximized .",
    "the primary aim of the analysis proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is to determine this value of @xmath3 and thence the distribution of `` critical '' relaxation times @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "particle behaviour such as mean squared displacement can then be analyzed in the context of @xmath23 for each individual grain and whether or not the particle is then `` fast '' or `` slow '' .    the method for determining the critical relaxation length @xmath3 is as follows",
    ": define the coarsegrained relaxation time @xmath24 for a given particle @xmath19 as the mean local relaxation time in a box of size @xmath25 centered on particle @xmath19 . as the size of the coarse - graining region",
    "is varied from @xmath26 ( essentially , the single particle relaxation time ) to the size of the analysis region @xmath27 , the spatial variation in @xmath24 should decrease ( the result of the coarsegraining procedure on the spatial map is depicted for one snapshot of the system in fig .  [",
    "fig : taur_cg ] for coarsegraining lengths of @xmath28 ) .",
    "thus , the distribution @xmath29 should become increasingly narrower , having zero width at @xmath27 where all of the @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear from the picture that the heterogenities persist up to larger @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "if the second cumulant @xmath33 of @xmath34 is calculated as : @xmath35 then @xmath33 should be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath31 , where the length scale associated with the decay of @xmath33 should vary with @xmath2 and be maximal at @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that the original measurement performed in ref .",
    "@xcite was for a 2d periodic system of soft particles in thermal equilibrium interacting via the repulsive potential @xmath36 . while the validity of this analysis should not depend on the type of microscopic interaction between particles , two additional considerations had to be taken into account before performing this calculation on the flowing granular system .",
    "firstly , motion due to the net flow of the system had to be subtracted off prior to calculating @xmath24 .",
    "while more complicated schemes involving a spatially varying flow field could be devised to more accurately compensate for this effect , for the analysis here the velocity over the region of interest @xmath37 was assumed to be constant in space at the snapshot at time @xmath38 ( _ i.e. _ so a particle s displacement @xmath39 in a given time interval @xmath40 is calculated as @xmath41 ) .",
    "this first approximation seemed to be sufficient to extract @xmath3 . secondly , because relaxation times were only calculated for particles in the constant flow region , not all particles in the system will be in this region at a given time , nor will a given particle necessarily remain in the region of interest until it reaches the specified value of @xmath2 .",
    "so the calculation only considers a given particle trajectory until it departs the analysis region .",
    "relaxation time distributions @xmath34 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trdist]a , with a comparison of the single - particle ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath26 ) relaxation time for several values of @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : trdist]b .",
    "the effect of increasing the coarsegraining region for a given value of @xmath2 is to smooth out the distribution for @xmath44 , and the width of the distribution decreases as expected for increasing @xmath31 .",
    "note that the single particle distribution for @xmath45 can be quite broad for large values of r. this is a reasonable result in the context of the calculation of @xmath3 ; the individual distributions for a particular value of @xmath46 can be broad initially , but unless there is any significant spatial correlation in relaxation times the spatial structure of @xmath47 will vanish rapidly with increasing @xmath31 compared to a value of @xmath2 with nontrivial spatial correlations .",
    "thus the utility of @xmath47 lies in its ability to emphasize spatial correlations between fast and slow particles ( _ i.e. _ if there are particles of widely different mobilities in the system but they were randomly distributed in space then no interesting correlation length is visible ) .",
    "the length scale associated with the decay of @xmath48 can be calculated from @xmath49 . as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] , there is a distinct peak in @xmath50 from which two separate and interesting length scales can be extracted .",
    "one is the location in @xmath2 of the peak ; this quantity is @xmath3 and it is the length scale over which the dynamical heterogeneity in relaxation times is maximized as described above .",
    "an additional interpretation can be made of @xmath3 as the critical fluctuation associated with cage - breaking in supercooled fluids ( or equivalently , the typical cage size ) .",
    "this was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and confirmed experimentally for slow , quasistatic granular shear flows in ref .",
    "@xcite . referring to the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] , this quantity is decreasing monotonically with flow velocity , although the exact functional form is difficult to determine .",
    "it is also important to note that because @xmath3 can be related back to a critical relaxation time , changes in @xmath3 with @xmath9 will correspond to changes in the distribution of @xmath23 .",
    "the second length scale which may be determined from @xmath50 is the peak height @xmath4 , which represents the average size of the heterogeneity . from fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] , it is difficult to determine if @xmath4 is varying with @xmath9 , or varying very slowly compared to the changes in @xmath3 .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where an increase in density produced an increase in @xmath4 while @xmath3 remained fixed .",
    "thus the crucial length scale which is growing as the flow velocity decreases in our system appears to be @xmath3 .",
    "there is some indication of a crossover between a low - velocity regime where @xmath51 may be changing more rapidly than @xmath3 to a high - velocity regime where changes in @xmath3 dominate as described above , but the current data is not sufficient to quantitatively distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "additionally , the effect of the finite size of the system on the dynamically correlated regions remains an interesting unresolved issue .",
    "while the correlation lengths measured over the range of flow velocities measured here are still sufficiently smaller than the system dimension , certainly at the slowest flow velocity observed the size of these regions begins to approach the system size ( at least in the direction perpendicular to the flow ) . in order to fully observe the behaviour of this length scale as the flow velocity",
    "is decreased further , it will be necessary to use larger systems .",
    "with the critical fluctuation @xmath3 determined , the critical relaxation time @xmath23 for each particle can be defined ( fig .",
    "[ fig : taur]b shows a snapshot of the @xmath52 system at @xmath53 ) . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , different particles can now be grouped into subsets according to their value of @xmath23 and the contribution of these subsets to dynamical measures ( in this case , the mean squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath54 ) can be evaluated .",
    "plots of @xmath54 vs. time are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ] for varying flow rates ( the distributions of critical relaxation times for a given flow rate are shown in the insets to fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "the msd averaged over all particles in the system in the short - time regime is approximately ballistic ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the long time power - law behaviour is characterized by a flow velocity dependent exponent ( @xmath56 , where @xmath57 in the range of flow velocities studied ) which is nearly diffusive .",
    "[ fig : msd]a shows the power - law fits to the mean squared displacement curves for two different flow velocities . at times comparable to the average time it takes a particle to cross the analysis region @xmath58",
    ", the particle falls out of the dense constant flow velocity region and accelerates under gravity , leading to the sharp increase in the mean squared displacement at @xmath59 .",
    "the msd curves for `` slow '' ( @xmath60 ) and `` fast '' ( @xmath61 ) particles reveal a deeper complexity not visible in the mean squared displacement averaged over the system as a whole . as @xmath62 ,",
    "these two groups of particles show increasing separation from the average msd , with the fast particles experiencing greater displacement than the average in a given time interval , and the slow particles exhibiting a plateau ( fig .",
    "[ fig : msd]b - c ) . for the slowest flow velocity measured , where the plateau is best defined",
    ", the plateau occurs at @xmath63 , corresponding to the experimental result of ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath3 has been directly associated with the cage size .",
    "thus the overall transport in this system is governed by the dynamical heterogeneity : fast and slow regions are evident as depicted pictorially in fig .",
    "[ fig : taur ] with particles in the slow region experiencing caging .",
    "as the flow velocity decreases , and the length scale @xmath3 increases , the effect of these mesoscopic regions becomes more pronounced , with the slow particles at @xmath52 remaining caged for the duration of their time to flow through the system ( recall that for all of these displacement measurements motion due to the average flow has been subtracted off ) .",
    "this picture of rich collective dynamics occuring even in the absence of any evident density fluctuations was also suggested by menon and durian in experiments on dense gravity - driven granular flow using diffusing wave spectroscopy ( dws )  @xcite .",
    "this is also in analogy to the msd for the lennard - jones system of ref .",
    "@xcite , where slow particles ( defined as the particles in the slowest @xmath64 of @xmath21 ) were seen to be caged over some time @xmath65 during which the fast particles experienced diffusion with a diffusion constant twice that of the assembly of disks as a whole .",
    "in summary , an interesting analysis for quantifying dynamical heterogeneity in non - equilibrium systems  @xcite independent of the microscopic interactions between particles has proven to be a useful tool for further investigation into the relevant time and length scales governing the dynamics of the gravity - driven granular system .",
    "measurements of relaxation time @xmath1 , defined as the time required for a particular particle to move a specified distance @xmath2 , provide an appealing physical picture of large - scale correlated regions with characteristic timescales chosen from a broad distribution of relaxation times @xmath66 . through a clever coarsegraining scheme which exploits the fact that the visible heterogeneity is maximized at a particular distance @xmath3 , both the distance",
    "@xmath3 ( which can be associated with average cage size ) and the spatial extent of the correlated regions @xmath4 were extracted in a completely threshold - independent way .",
    "while @xmath4 was shown to be @xmath67 independent of flow velocity , the cage size @xmath3 grows as the flow velocity decreases .",
    "@xmath3 then specifically defines the critical distribution of relaxation times @xmath21 which can be used to explore the effect of complex collective behaviour on dynamic properties such as the average mean squared displacement @xmath68 .",
    "the msd in turn reveals a nontrivial spatial dependence in the mobility , indicating that while the total mean squared displacement at long times may seem approximately diffusive , there is underlying complexity in the form of `` fast '' and `` slow '' regions in the sample .",
    "this result is in agreement with several experimental studies on dense , driven granular materials  @xcite and other jamming systems  @xcite .",
    "additionally , there is a qualitative resemblance between the spatial maps of relaxation time near the critical value @xmath23 ( _ c.f . _",
    "[ fig : taur]b ) and recent measures of dynamic propensity and local debye - waller factors in 2d simulations of glass - formers  @xcite .",
    "+ one as yet unresolved puzzle is the relationship between the frequent - collision / high - stress chains identified in previous studies  @xcite and the mesoscopic clumps of fast and slow particles characterized by a particular value of @xmath23 . from observations of the spatial map of collision frequency and critical relaxation time at a given snapshot of the system (",
    "not shown ) it is difficult to ascertain if there is any correlation between the chains and regions of varying @xmath23 , indeed , there can still be strong heterogeneity in the critical relaxation time in the absence of any chains .",
    "one measureable connection is that @xmath69 , which is the same scaling with flow velocity that was measured in the stress autocorrelations in ref .",
    "@xcite and associated with the lifetime of the chains .",
    "thus @xmath70 constant could be an important clue to the dynamical principles leading to the heterogeneities , and may provide some additional insight into the reasons for why the frequently - colliding / high - stress chains form in these dense granular systems .",
