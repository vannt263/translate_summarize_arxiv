    "is the majority of the mass of a typical solar - mass star accreted in stochastic outbursts or in a smooth process of infall from a circumstellar envelope , through an accretion disk , and onto the star ?",

    "the sed of hops 383 appears in figure  [ f.sed ] . due to the paucity of pre - outburst data , we focus on the post - outburst sed . for data products where time series exist ,",
    "the variability within the time series is small compared to the range of the whole sed , so we choose a representative observation for the sed ; the time series are discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity @xmath18 of the post - outburst sed is 7.5 @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite showed that , for protostars , the correlation between flux density at a given wavelength and luminosity tightens with increasing wavelength between 3 and 70 .",
    "lacking pre - outburst 70  data , we estimate that the change in luminosity was equal to the factor of 35 increase in the 24  flux density , giving a pre - outburst luminosity of 0.2 @xmath1 .",

    "the class 0 objects have @xmath20 @xcite , and hops 383 has a ratio of 1.4% , confirming its deeply embedded status and making it the only known class 0 accretion outburst .",
    "this ratio is toward the low end of the range observed for the extreme class 0 objects known as pacs bright red sources @xcite",
    ".    another diagnostic is the bolometric temperature , the temperature of a blackbody with the same mean frequency as that of the protostellar sed @xcite . the class 0 protostars",
    "have @xmath21 @xcite , and these correspond roughly to protostars in which the majority of the mass is in the infalling envelope , not yet in the star @xcite .",
    "the sed of hops 383 has @xmath22 , again consistent with class 0 .",
    "additional evidence for a deeply embedded object comes from fitting a modified blackbody to the sed , where the method of @xcite gives a peak wavelength of 106  ( larger peak wavelengths imply denser envelopes ) and a lower limit to the envelope mass of 0.2 @xmath23 . estimating the mass from the 870  apex flux alone , assuming a temperature of 18 k ( stutz et al . , in preparation ) and oh5 opacities from @xcite , gives a mass of 0.7 @xmath23 in the laboca beam , which has a half - width at half maximum corresponding to a radius of 4000 au .",
    "these mass estimates point to a protostar in the earlier phases of infall .",
    "to estimate the luminosity , inclination angle , and cavity opening angle of hops 383 , we modeled the _ spitzer _ , _ herschel _ , and apex photometry of the source with the radiative transfer code of @xcite .",
    "the hops team created a grid of 3040 model seds with parameters appropriate for protostars , first described by @xcite , and updated by e.  furlan et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "we found the best fit by minimizing @xmath24 , which measures the logarithmic deviation of the models from the observations in units of the fractional uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the best - fit model ( @xmath25 ) has a total luminosity of 8.7 @xmath1 , an inclination of 41@xmath26 from pole - on , and a cavity opening angle of 25@xmath26 .",
    "other models that provide satisfying fits to the data ( @xmath27 ) have total luminosities ranging from 6 to 14 @xmath1 , inclinations ranging from 41@xmath26 to 63@xmath26 from pole - on , and cavity opening angles from 15@xmath26 to 35@xmath26 .",
    "( the total luminosity can differ from the observed luminosity due to the non - isotropic radiation field . )",
    "the scattered - light cone extending to the northwest and bright features to the southeast in the newfirm image of figure  [ f.images ] appear to be from radiation escaping the outflow cavity and imply an intermediate inclination angle , consistent with the sed .",
    "our best sampling of the variability of hops 383 comes from the _ spitzer _ ysovar data at 3.6 and 4.5  and the _",
    "herschel_/pacs 70  data .",
    "figure  [ f.var ] shows these light curves .",
    "after the 2 mag jump at 4.5  between 2004 and 2009 ( not shown ) , the 2009 season of ysovar data yielded remarkably constant photometry , failing the variability tests laid out in @xcite .",
    "the slopes of the best - fit lines to the light curves indicate brightenings of only 0.07 mag at 3.6  and 0.08 mag at 4.5 , and the @xmath28-[4.5]$ ] color reddened by only 0.01 mag .    there were two day - long series of _ wise _ observations at 3.4 and 4.6  between the 2009 and 2010 ysovar campaigns , on 2010 march 89 and 2010 september 1516 .",
    "no significant variability from the _ wise _ fluxes shown in the sed ( fig .",
    "[ f.sed ] ) was detected .",
    "the second ( 2010 ) ysovar season showed a slight fading of the source , with a dimming of 0.20 mag at 3.6  and 0.15 mag at 4.5 .",
    "again , the color was more consistent than the magnitudes , with a reddening of 0.05 mag over the window .",
    "herschel_/pacs 70  data show variability at the 18% level .",
    "the first significant gap in the pacs observations coincides with the 2010 ysovar window ; both light curves suggest a decline over this period . between the first 70  observation on 2010 september 10 and the second - to - last one on 2012",
    "march 18 , the flux density declined by 13% before recovering on 2012 august 27 to its brightest yet .",
    "we have presented multi - epoch infrared data from 2.2 to 870  to show an outburst of the class 0 protostar hops 383 , adjacent to the ngc 1977 nebula in orion , between 2004 and 2006 . by 2008 ,",
    "the source became 35 times brighter at 24  than it was in 2004 .",
    "the post - outburst luminosity , which is uncertain due to modeling degeneracies , is most likely between 6 and 14 @xmath1 .",
    "subsequent monitoring of the source at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 70  finds variability but no evidence for a significant decline in the source luminosity between 2009 and 2012 .    one possible mechanism for the observed rise in the 24  flux density would be the removal from the line of sight of a large amount of extinguishing material .",
    "we are able to rule this out on two grounds .",
    "first , using the opacity law from @xcite plotted in figure  3 of @xcite and a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , a factor of 35 increase in the 24  flux density would correspond to a reduction in the column density of @xmath29 @xmath30 , which would correspond to an implausible reduction in @xmath31 of 70 .",
    "second , the source became brighter at submillimeter wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ f.smm ] ) , which can not be the result of a drop in extinction and is most likely due to an increase in the envelope temperature due to increased heating @xcite . ruling out a change in extinction implies that the observed flux increase was due to a genuine increase in the source luminosity .",
    "ysos undergoing such luminosity outbursts are generally classified as ex lup objects , with repeated short - term flux increases of about a magnitude that persist for approximately one year , or as fu ori objects , with a single burst of several magnitudes and the persistence of an elevated state for decades @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "an increase in the accretion rate onto the star is thought to be responsible for the luminosity increase .",
    "outbursts have also been observed with light curves that do not fit cleanly into either category ; e.g. , v1647 ori @xcite and v2492 cyg @xcite , and final confirmation of the type of outburst requires optical or near - infrared spectra to diagnose conditions in the region where disk material is accreting onto the star @xcite . due to the lack of such spectra for a deeply embedded source , we are limited in our ability to conclusively identify the class of outburst or the precise mechanism for the luminosity increase in hops 383 , but the post - outburst light curves indicate the persistence of elevated luminosity from the first evidence of brightening in 2006 to the most recent _ herschel_/pacs imaging in 2012 , inconsistent with the short - term ex lup events .",
    "hops 383 is unambiguously a class 0 yso based on the arguments presented in section 3.2 .",
    "while outbursting ysos are known to have envelopes in some cases @xcite , none has yet been detected that is as deeply embedded as hops 383 .",
    "detections of disks in such deeply embedded protostars remain rare @xcite , but there is indirect evidence from the ubiquity of outflows and jets that there are disks around nearly all protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since proposed mechanisms for accretion outbursts are grounded in disk instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the outburst of hops 383 is another form of indirect evidence for a disk in a class 0 source .",
    "the discovery of this outburst demonstrates that episodic accretion can occur very early in the star formation process , and we encourage follow - up observations to begin to understand the physics at work .",
    "support for this work was provided by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) through awards issued by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology ( jpl / caltech ) .",
