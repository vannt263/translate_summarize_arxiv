    "here we show that the diffusion on a hypersphere @xcite is transformed into the diffusion for the wright - fisher model with a particular mutation rate @xcite , by using the relation , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 s denote the relative abundance of alleles and @xmath2 s denote the position of a particle of the diffusion on a hypersphere .",
    "diffusion on a sphere has been applied to various problems in physics , chemistry , mathematics , etc . @xcite .",
    "the wright - fisher model is widely used to study the random sampling effect in population genetics @xcite .",
    "we consider stochastic differential equations in the ito sense @xcite .",
    "we represent the wright - fisher model for @xmath3 alleles as well as the diffusion on @xmath4-dimensional sphere @xcite , by using @xmath5 independent standard brownian motion @xmath6 @xmath7 with the skew symmetry @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "our representation is useful to simulate the wright - fisher model @xcite .",
    "there are effective simulation methods to simulate a brownian motion on a hypersphere for example @xcite .",
    "our representation is simple and may be useful to simulate the brownian motion on a hypersphere .",
    "in the wright - fisher model each of the genes of the next generation is obtained by a random choice among the genes of the previous generation and that the whole population changes all at once . in moran s model",
    "@xcite it is supposed that there are @xmath9 individuals each formed from @xmath3 alleles @xmath10 , and that each instant at which the state of the model may change , one individual of the alleles , chosen at random , dies and is replaced by a new individual which is @xmath11 with probability @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the abundance of the allele @xmath11 . it is supposed that the probability of any individual `` dying '' during an interval @xmath14 and then being replaced by a new individual",
    "is @xmath15 .",
    "hence the mean number of such events in unit time is @xmath16 and the mean length of a generation is @xmath17 .",
    "the following model of interacting particles @xcite is equivalent with the moran model .    consider a population of @xmath18 particles each of which is one of @xmath3 types , @xmath19 .",
    "the types may represent species , alleles , genotypes or other classification .",
    "we then consider random interactions between particles , which are assumed to occur at the rate @xmath15 per time interval @xmath14 for each particle .",
    "if a pair of particles of different types @xmath20 and @xmath21 interact , then after the interaction the both particles are the type @xmath20 with probability 1/2 and the type @xmath21 with probability 1/2 .",
    "if the type of the interacting particles are the same , no change occurs .",
    "we can approximate the behavior of our interacting particle system by a stochastic differential equation ( [ wright ] ) . in it ,",
    "the relative abundance of type @xmath20 increases by @xmath22 and decreases by @xmath22 with the interaction of the particles of type @xmath21 , where @xmath23 .",
    "hence our interacting particle system automatically makes the following equation ( [ eq : collision ] ) , which has the genetic drift matrix with the elements @xmath24 for @xmath25 as covariances .    for @xmath25 ,",
    "consider @xmath26 with @xmath8 , where @xmath6 @xmath27 are mutually independent one - dimensional brownian motion with the mean 0 and the variance @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this representation of the wright - fisher model @xcite is applied to make computer simulations on models in population genetics @xcite . here",
    "we make use of this equation ( [ eq : collision ] ) to discuss the exact solutions of the diffusion equations considering the diffusion on a unit sphere .",
    "the isotropic diffusion on the @xmath4-dimensional unit sphere is given by the following stochastic differential equation in the ito sense .",
    "@xmath29 with @xmath8 , for @xmath30 , where @xmath6 @xmath27 are mutually independent one - dimensional brownian motion with the mean 0 and the variance @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath31 . by using the ito calculus @xcite ,",
    "we have for the stochastic differential @xmath32 hence starting from a point on the unit hypersphere , the trajectory is on the unit hypersphere @xmath33 . consider the dot product for a unit vector @xmath34 , @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the tangent hyperplane at @xmath36 of the hypersphere , for @xmath37 which is perpendicular to @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 we have the expectation @xmath40 we have @xmath41 since @xmath42+(\\sum_i \\l_iy_i)^2\\\\ & &   = \\sum_{i > j } [ ( l_iy_j)^2+(y_il_j)^2]+\\sum_i ( l_iy_i)^2=(\\sum_{i}l_i^2)(\\sum_{i}y_i^2)=1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath43 does not depend on the direction @xmath37 at the tangential point @xmath38 of the tangential plane .",
    "hence we see the diffusion is isotropic and we have the fokker - planck equation on the hypersphere for the laplace - beltrami operator @xcite in space @xmath44 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 from ( [ var ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath47 is for @xmath48 spherical coordinates @xmath49 of the unit vector @xmath50 of @xmath44 defined by the relations @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 . the integration measure in @xmath44",
    "is defined as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the surface of the sphere @xmath44 . with this normalization @xmath57 .",
    "the solution @xcite , the transition probability density for the isotropic diffusion on hypersphere , is obtained by using the definitions and notations of the chapter ix of the book @xcite .",
    "the gegenbauer polynomial @xmath58 is defined as the coefficient of @xmath59 in the power - series expansion of the function @xmath60 the transition probability density from @xmath61 ( with @xmath62 spherical coordinates @xmath63 ) at @xmath64 to @xmath38 ( with @xmath65 ) at @xmath66 is given @xcite by @xmath67 for the dot product @xmath68 , where @xmath69",
    "let @xmath70 denote @xmath3 allele types in a population .",
    "the general neutral alleles model has a probability @xmath71 of a mutation from @xmath11 to @xmath72 .",
    "an exact solution is known for the case of the 0 mutation rate case in three dimensions @xcite . assuming parent - independent mutation @xcite , @xmath73 .",
    "an expansion of the transition probability density @xcite , from the initial relative abudances @xmath74 to the relative abundances @xmath75 , is obtained for the following fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : fp3 ] ) , @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 . for @xmath79 , the stationary density @xcite",
    "is given by @xmath80 the solution of equation ( [ eq : fp3 ] ) is given by an expansion in orthogonal polynomials @xcite .",
    "for the case @xmath81 , @xmath82 , we have the solution @xcite , @xmath83 for @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 with @xmath87 for the notation @xmath88 .",

    "the transition probability density @xmath96 for equation ( [ eq : fp3 ] ) with @xmath97 , @xmath98 on the relative abundances @xmath99 starting from @xmath100 is represented by using the transition probability density @xmath101 , for equation ( [ rho ] ) , on @xmath102 with spherical coordinates @xmath103 of @xmath4-dimensional sphere starting from @xmath104 with spherical coordinates @xmath105 , as @xmath106 we have @xmath107 considering equation ( [ rho ] ) , ( [ surface ] ) , ( [ gegen ] ) , ( [ jacobi3 ] ) we have @xmath108    thus we proved the solution ( [ solution ] ) is equivalent with the solution ( [ griffiths ] ) for the case @xmath109 .",
    "let us observe the two forms of the solution .",
    "consider the eigen values of the two diffusion equations ( [ rh ] ) and ( [ eq : fp3 ] ) .",
    "the caillol solution @xcite of ( [ rh ] ) , expanded by the gegenbauer polynomials , are applied in equation ( [ solution ] ) .",
    "the gegenbauer polynomials for odd @xmath110 in equation ( [ solution ] ) cancel with each other as we can see from equation ( [ gegen ] ) .",
    "hence there is no term for odd @xmath110 in equation ( [ solution ] ) , @xcite .",
    "put @xmath111 , and take @xmath112 ( @xmath95 in ( [ var ] ) ) , for particular mutation rate @xmath113 .",

    "also we see @xmath120 our study naturally connects the diffusion on a hypersphere with the wright - fisher model for a particular mutation rate of the parent - independent mutation .",
    "the connection between diffusion on a hypersphere and the 1-dimensional wright - fisher diffusion has been derived before ( p338 in @xcite ) .",
    "the equation ( 13.33 ) in @xcite corresponds to equation ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "they derive the spectral expansion for a wider range of parameters . to extend this argument to the multidimensional case",
    "is one of our next problems .",
    "the eigenfunctions in our equation ( [ solution ] ) and the eigen function ( [ qn ] ) in the griffiths solution for the particular mutation rate look different , although they are identical .",
    "we do not have the algebraic proof in our present work and wish to have it in our next work .",
    "the form of the polynomials in our expansion means that they are the reproducing kernel polynomials for orthogonal polynomials on the dirichlet measure @xcite , because all pairs of polynomials of the same degree are added to form the coefficient of a given eigenvalue .",
