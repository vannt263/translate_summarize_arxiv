    "in this section , we briefly describe the connection between heegaard splittings and morse functions .",
    "we define a _",
    "morse function _ as a smooth function whose critical points are all non - degenerate .",
    "( see @xcite for basic notions in morse theory . )",
    "note that we do not assume that the critical points have pairwise distinct values .",
    "the condition can be satisfied after an arbitrarily small _ quasi - isotopy_. a _ quasi - isotopy _ is a homotopy consisting of morse functions .",
    "it is an equivalence relation of morse functions and each equivalence class is called a _ quasi - isotopy class_.    suppose @xmath3 is a closed orientable connected smooth @xmath0-manifold and @xmath43 is a morse function .",
    "let @xmath44 be a morse function obtained from @xmath13 by a small quasi - isotopy such that the critical points of @xmath44 have pairwise distinct values .",
    "such a morse function corresponds to a handle decomposition as follows : let @xmath45 be the critical values and @xmath46 be regular values of @xmath44 such that @xmath47 .",

    ", @xmath44 determines a handle decomposition for @xmath3 .",
    "conversely , we can construct a morse function corresponding to a given handle decomposition",
    ".    a quasi - isotopy keeps all the critical points non - degenerate but does not always keep the order of the critical values in @xmath52 . a quasi - isotopy",
    "changing the order of the critical values corresponds to a rearrangement of handles of the handle decomposition .",
    "it is well known that the handles can be rearranged so that the lower the index is , the earlier a handle is attached .",
    "then the union @xmath20 of the @xmath53-handles and the @xmath54-handles is a handlebody , and dually the union @xmath22 of the @xmath55-handles and the @xmath0-handles is also a handlebody . denoting the common boundary of @xmath16 by @xmath17 ,",
    "the triple @xmath5 is a heegaard splitting for @xmath3 .",
    "it is known that the isotopy class of the heegaard splitting @xmath5 is independent of the order in which the handles are attached ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we thus have the following :    [ uniqueness ] a quasi - isotopy class of morse functions determines a unique isotopy class of heegaard splittings .",
    "we remark that the condition about critical values is not required for a morse function to determine an isotopy class of heegaard splittings . in this sense",
    ", we say that @xmath13 _ represents _ @xmath5 .",
