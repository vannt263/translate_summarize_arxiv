    "it is still a matter of controversy which one of the two competing mechanisms ( @xmath5 hard scattering @xcite or the feynman mechanism @xcite ) is responsible for the experimentally observed power - law behaviour of elastic hadronic form factors .",
    "a distinctive feature of the feynman mechanism contribution is that , at sufficiently large momentum transfer , it is dominated by configurations in which one of the quarks carries almost all the momentum of the hadron . on the other hand ,",
    "the hard scattering term is generated by the valence configurations with small transverse sizes and finite light - cone fractions of the total hadron momentum carried by each valence quark . for large @xmath2 in qcd",
    ", this difference results in an extra @xmath6-suppression of the feynman term compared to the hard scattering one .",
    "the hard term , which eventually dominates , can be written in a factorized form @xcite,@xcite,@xcite as a product of a perturbatively calculable hard scattering amplitude and two distribution amplitudes ( da s ) describing how the large longitudinal momentum of the initial and final hadron is shared by its constituents .",
    "this mechanism involves exchange of virtual gluons , each exchange bringing in a noticeable suppression factor @xmath7 .",
    "hence , to describe existing data by the hard contribution alone , one should increase somehow the magnitude of the hard scattering term .",
    "this is usually achieved by using the da s with a peculiar `` humped '' shape @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the passive quarks carry a rather small fraction of the hadron momentum and , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the `` hard '' scattering subprocess , even at rather large momentum transfers @xmath8 , is dominated by rather small gluon virtualities .",
    "this means that the hard scattering scenario heavily relies on the assumption that the asymptotic pqcd approximations ( @xmath9 the @xmath10-behaviour of the gluon propagator @xmath11 ) are accurate even for momenta @xmath12 smaller than @xmath13 , @xmath14 in the region strongly affected by finite - size effects , nonperturbative qcd vacuum fluctuations , @xmath15 including these effects decreases the magnitude of the gluon propagator @xmath11 at small spacelike @xmath12 converting @xmath11 into something like @xmath16 and shifts the hard contributions significantly below the data level even if one uses the humpy da s and other modifications increasing the hard term ( see , @xmath9 @xcite ) .",
    "it is usually claimed that the humpy da s are supported by qcd sum rules for the moments @xmath17 of the da s .",
    "however , it is worth emphasizing that applications of the qcd sum rules to nonlocal hadronic characteristics ( functions ) , like da s @xmath18 and form factors @xmath19 , are less straightforward than those for the simpler classic cases @xcite of hadronic masses and decay widths .",
    "the main problem is that the coefficients of the operator product expansion for the relevant correlators depend now on the extra parameter ( @xmath9 on the order of the moment @xmath20 or momentum transfer @xmath2 ) , and contributions due to higher condensates rapidly increase with the increase of @xmath20 or @xmath2 . in this situation ,",
    "one is forced to make ( explicitly or implicitly ) an assumption about the structure of the higher condensates . as argued in ref.@xcite",
    ", the derivation of the humpy distribution amplitudes in @xcite , based on the lowest condensates only ( which amounts to the assumption that higher condensates are small ) , implies a rather singular picture ( infinite correlation length ) of the qcd vacuum fluctuations . under more realistic assumptions ( finite correlation length for nonlocal condensates ) ,",
    "the qcd sum rules produce da s close to smooth `` asymptotic '' forms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in the well - studied case of the pion , the sum rules with nonlocal condensates have the property that the humps in the relevant correlator ( corresponding to a sum over all possible states ) get more pronounced when the relative pion contribution decreases ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this means that the humps of the correlator are generated by the higher states rather than by the pion .",
    "independent evidence in favour of the smooth form of the pion distribution amplitude @xmath21 is provided by the result of ref.@xcite , where it was found that @xmath22 , to be compared with @xmath23 for the asymptotic distribution amplitude @xcite,@xcite and @xmath24 for the humpy cz form @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lattice calculation of ref.@xcite gives a rather small value @xmath25 for the second moment of the pion da incompatible with the humpy form ( compare with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "the cleanest experimental test of the shape of the pion da has been provided by the studies of the @xmath28 transition form factor . at large @xmath2 of the virtual photon , this form factor",
    "is governed by the pqcd hard scattering mechanism alone : there is no soft contribution and pqcd predicts that @xmath29 approaches a constant value specified by the same integral of the pion da that appears in the hard - scattering contribution to the pion em form factor .",
    "experimentally @xcite , @xcite , the product @xmath29 is essentially constant for @xmath30[0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}2 \\ ,",
    "gev^2 $ ] in the whole investigated region , @xmath14 till @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the experimental large-@xmath2 value of @xmath29 is a factor of 2 smaller than the cz value and even somewhat smaller than that corresponding to the asymptotic da .    if the pion da is narrow , the hard contribution is small compared to existing form factor data .",
    "it becomes even smaller if one includes the finite - size effects . on the other hand ,",
    "the estimates of the soft term by an overlap of model wave functions produce a soft contribution comparable in size with the data , even in the case when the pion wave function gives a smooth distribution amplitude and the hard term is small @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if one intends to increase the hard term by using wave functions providing wide or humpy da s , one also increases the soft term which then marginally overshoots the data .",
    "this observation , extracted from quark - model calculations @xcite , was also confirmed both within the standard qcd sum rule analysis @xcite and in the framework of light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite . in application to form factors , the qcd sum rules were first used to calculate the soft contribution for the pion form factor in the region of moderately large @xcite,@xcite and then small momentum transfers @xcite . in the whole region @xmath32[0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}3 \\ , gev^2 $ ] , the results are very close to the experimental data : the feynman mechanism alone is sufficient to explain the observed magnitude of the pion form factor . for higher @xmath2 , the classic qcd sum rule method fails due to increasing contributions from higher condensates .",
    "however , a model summation of the higher terms into nonlocal condensates indicates that the soft term dominates the pion form factor up to @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "an important observation made in ref.@xcite is that the results of the elaborate svz - type qcd sum rule analysis ( involving condensates , svz - borel transformation , fitting the spectrum , @xmath15 ) are rather accurately reproduced by a simpler local quark - hadron duality prescription .",
    "the latter states that one can get an estimate for a hadronic form factor by considering transitions between the free - quark states produced by a local current having the hadron s quantum numbers , with subsequent averaging of the invariant mass of the quark states over the appropriate duality interval @xmath34 .",
    "the duality interval has a specific value for each hadron , @xmath9 @xmath35 for the pion and @xmath36 for the nucleon .",
    "the qcd local duality ansatz @xcite , equivalent to fixing the form of the soft wave function , was used to estimate the soft contribution for the proton magnetic form factor @xcite .",
    "the results agree with available data @xcite , @xcite over a wide region , @xmath37[0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}q^2 \\ , { \\raisebox{-.2ex}{$\\stackrel{\\textstyle < } { \\raisebox{-.6ex}[0ex][0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}\\ ,   20\\ , gev^2 $ ] .",
    "hence , a sizable hard term is not welcome , since the total ( soft@xmath38hard ) contribution then overshoots the data . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the only way to make the hard contribution large is by using the cz - type da s with humps , otherwise it is very small .",
    "since the qcd sum rules for the moments of the baryon da s have the same structure as those for the pion da , there is no doubt that using the nonlocal condensates would produce baryon da s without pronounced humps .",
    "another piece of evidence against the cz - type da s for the nucleons is provided by a lattice calculation @xcite which failed to observe any asymmetry for the proton da characteristic of the cz - type amplitudes .",
    "on the experimental side , it should be noted that the local - duality estimate @xcite of the soft term for the proton form factor correctly reproduces ( without any adjustable parameter ) , the observed magnitude of the helicity - nonconservation effects for the proton form factors : @xmath39 with @xmath40 @xcite . within the scenario based on hard scattering dominance ,",
    "it is rather difficult to understand the origin of such a large scale , since possible sources of helicity nonconservation in pqcd include only small scales like quark masses , intrinsic transverse momenta , @xmath15 , and one would rather expect that @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the study of spin - related properties may provide crucial evidence that , for experimentally accessible momentum transfers , the hadronic form factors are dominated by the purely soft contribution .    especially promising in this respect",
    "are studies of the @xmath0 transition . renewed attention to this process was raised by the results @xcite of the analysis of inclusive slac data which indicated that the effective transition form factor drops faster than one would expect from quark counting rules @xcite , @xcite . within the hard scattering scenario ,",
    "this process was originally analyzed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was observed there that the hard scattering amplitude in this case has an extra suppression due to cancellation between symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the nucleon distribution amplitude .",
    "hence , one can try to explain the faster fall - off found in @xcite by the dominance of some non - asymptotic contribution .",
    "however , it was claimed @xcite that , by appropriately choosing the distribution amplitudes , one can still make the leading - twist hard term comparable in magnitude with the data .",
    "furthermore , a recent reanalysis @xcite of the inclusive slac data has produced results which are more consistent with the quark counting @xmath42-behaviour , and this revived the hope that the @xmath0 form factor at accessible @xmath2 is dominated by the pqcd contribution .",
    "one should remember , however , that the @xmath0 transition is described by three independent form factors , and a correct theory should not only be able to adjust the absolute magnitude of one of them : it should also be able to explain the relations between different form factors .",
    "in particular , the pqcd calculation @xcite predicts that the lowest - twist hard contribution always has the property @xmath43 .",
    "this prediction is a specific example of the helicity selection rules @xcite inherent in the hard scattering mechanism .",

    "we use the local quark - hadron duality approach to estimate the soft contribution to the @xmath0 transition form factors .",
    "we investigate whether the soft contribution to the magnetic form factor is large enough to describe the data .",
    "we also pay special attention to the relationship between different spin components of the soft contribution in the region of moderately large momentum transfers @xmath45[0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}q^2 { \\raisebox{-.2ex}{$\\stackrel{\\textstyle < } { \\raisebox{-.6ex}[0ex][0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}\\ , 15 \\ , gev^2 $ ] .",

    "this means that all the results obtained in this paper are applicable also for the neutron to @xmath67 transition : one should only interchange @xmath68 , @xmath59 , the only difference is that all the @xmath69 form factors will have an opposite sign compared to their @xmath0 analogues .    to obtain @xmath58 from @xmath62 , it is convenient to use the parametric representation described in appendix a. as a result , we get @xmath58 in the following form @xmath70 here , @xmath71 is a set of independent lorentz structures .",

    "our main conclusion is thus that the soft term is sufficiently large to play the dominant role at accessible energies .",
    "the magnetic form factor @xmath103 can also be obtained from the `` contaminated '' duality relation ( [ 21 ] ) . if one takes the basic duality interval @xmath182 , the resulting values of @xmath103 ( fig.[fig:2 ] ) are somewhat smaller than those obtained by combining the results for @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "since the spin-1/2 states also contribute to the trace of @xmath133 , the duality interval in this case can be different from the basic value .",
    "in fact , taking @xmath208 in eq.([21 ] ) , we get a curve for @xmath209 ( fig.[fig:2 ] ) essentially coinciding with those obtained from the sum of @xmath204 and @xmath205 .      using eq.([16 ] ) and applying the local duality prescription to the invariant amplitudes related to the structures @xmath212",

    "one can see that the @xmath103 form factor obtained in this way is a factor 1.5 smaller than that given by combining the results for @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",

    "in this situation , we restrict ourselves to a conservative statement that the local quark - hadron duality indicates that the electric form factor @xmath105 is small compared to @xmath103 in the whole experimentally accessible region , without insisting on a specific curve ( or even sign ) for @xmath105",

    "the curve for @xmath158 obtained from the expressions for @xmath215 gives somewhat larger ( and opposite in sign ) values for the ratio @xmath223 , but the difference between the two results can be attributed again to the uncertainty in the values of large form factors @xmath215 .",
    "in this paper , we used the local quark - hadron duality approach to estimate the purely nonperturbative soft contribution to the @xmath224 transition form factors .",
    "our results can be also applied to the @xmath225 transition : @xmath226 , @xmath59 the only difference is the sign of the relevant form factors .",
    "the large-@xmath2 behaviour of the soft contribution is governed by the feynman mechanism which formally has an extra @xmath6 suppression in the region of asymptotically large @xmath2 . however , our estimates for the effective form factor @xmath104 are close to those obtained from a recent analysis of inclusive data @xcite .",
    "this means that the data can be described without a sizable contribution from the hard - scattering mechanism .",
    "we picked out several lorentz structures which appear in the decomposition of the basic three - point amplitude and observed a satisfactory agreement between the results obtained from different invariant amplitudes .",
    "all our estimates indicate that the transition is dominated by the magnetic form factor @xmath103 , with electric @xmath105 and quadrupole @xmath158 form factors being small compared to @xmath103 for all experimentally accessible momentum transfers .",
