    "one of the main goals in the field of @xmath0-conjugated polymers is the fabrication of opto - electronic devices such as solar cells , light - emitting diodes , and displays  @xcite .",
    "the operating part of these devices is a thin ( spun - cast ) film of a polymer between two electrical contacts through which holes and electrons are injected into the film . evidently , the resulting excited electron - hole states in the disordered polymer film determine the optical properties of the whole device .",
    "the simplest access to them is the measurement of the absorption of the polymer film .    more information is provided by the so - called oligomer approach  @xcite .",
    "oligomers of increasing length  @xmath1 are synthesized where  @xmath1 is a multiple of a monomer repetition unit .",
    "quite universally , one observes a bathochromic shift for the lowest - energy absorption peak , i.e. , @xmath2 monotonically decreases as a function of  @xmath1 . for medium",
    "- sized oligomers there is a regime where @xmath2 drops almost linearly in @xmath3 , and only the smallest oligomers may deviate from the linear fit . for larger oligomers",
    ", however , @xmath2 appears to saturate quickly  @xcite .",
    "it is also known , that perfectly - ordered polymers still have a finite gap for optical excitations , i.e. , they are insulators  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study this length dependence of the optical absorption theoretically and identify the existing length scales in ordered and disordered oligomers . as a generic example for a @xmath0-conjugated system one can choose polyacetylene and the homologous oligomers , the oligoenes . here",
    ", @xmath1 is given by the number  @xmath4 of carbon atoms in the conjugated system whose average distance is @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "as a starting point , ordered oligoenes can be described by the peierls model  @xcite which correctly describes polymers as insulators . moreover , in a peierls insulator the lowest excitation energy at the fermi vector @xmath7 ( antiperiodic boundary conditions ) becomes @xmath8 for large systems , @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 accounts for the bond alternation . from  ( [ peierlsgap ] )",
    "one can conclude that the convergence towards the peierls gap is quadratic in @xmath11 .",
    "this result does not contradict the experimental observation of a linear behavior in @xmath11 for medium - sized oligomers , as in this range a taylor expansion is always a good approximation .",
    "apart from the length scales set by the nominal oligomer size  @xmath4 there is another important length scale in the problem due to the electron - electron interaction .",
    "the importance of the electron - electron interaction has been pointed out a long time ago  @xcite .",
    "in fact , well - ordered polydiacetylenes display excitons with a substantial binding energy  @xcite .",
    "calculations for ordered oligomers and polymers have been performed recently on the basis of wannier theory  @xcite , the gw approximation to density functional theory  @xcite , strong - coupling approaches  @xcite , and numerical investigations of interacting electron systems  @xcite and interacting electron - phonon systems  @xcite .",
    "these investigations show that the average electron - hole distance , @xmath12 , is an important length scale for the optical absorption of oligomers , specific to the monomer building unit .",
    "this explains the deviations for the smallest oligomers from an expected behavior , as finite - size effects seriously hamper the formation of a bound electron - hole pair .",
    "the microscopic theoretical approaches presented so far apply to ordered chains .",
    "disorder may break down longer oligomers into shorter , ordered chains . according to a basic statistical analysis of this ` hard disorder ' model  @xcite , oligomers with the full nominal length",
    "@xmath4 are highly unlikely to be found for large  @xmath4 , and the ` typical ' chain length , @xmath13 , increases only very slowly with  @xmath4 .",
    "this is one reason of the observed saturation effect of @xmath14 .",
    "` soft disorder ' is induced by a random bending of ordered segments against each other .",
    "the electron - transfer matrix elements between the segments then depend on the ( small ) bending angle  @xmath15 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this can turn the quadratic dependence  ( [ peierlsgap ] ) back to a linear behavior of @xmath16 on @xmath11 , @xmath17 this also supports the observation of a linear @xmath11 behavior of @xmath16 for medium - sized oligomers .",
    "@xmath13 is in this case defined as the correlation length for the coplanarity of ordered segments .    in general",
    ", the length dependence of the optical excitations of a polymer film is an interplay between three different length scales : @xmath4 , the nominal length of the oligomers , which are broken down into segments of typical length @xmath13 by disorder effects , and @xmath18 , defined by the electron - electron interaction . a minimal microscopic description of oligoenes should combine the microscopic approaches for the ordered systems with the statistical ones for the disordered systems in order to cover all three length scales .",
    "therefore , a suitable hamiltonian includes a bond alternation due to the peierls distortion , possible formation of bound electron - hole pairs due to the coulomb interaction , and soft disorder due to torsion or bending of the oligomer chain .",
    "the experimental situation where long oligomers appear to be cut into smaller chains can be taken into account by a suitable average over chain - length distributions .",
    "a more quantitative analysis will also consider polaronic effects due to the electron - lattice coupling .",

    "as mentioned above , the average electron - hole distance decreases for increasing disorder strength .",
    "the reason for this decrease is not the increase of the binding energy , a quantity which not only depends on the energy of the excited - state resonance but also on the size of the single - particle gap . instead , the disorder ` squeezes ' the electron - hole pairs into segments of length @xmath185 . in the clean system",
    ", the excited - state wave function essentially spreads over the whole chain , and one sees a reduction only at the chain ends .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of substantial disorder the electron - hole pair is squeezed into regions which are much smaller than the nominal oligomer size .",
    "for example , for @xmath73 and @xmath155 the system almost acts as if it was an ordered chain about half the actual size , with a concomitant reduction of the electron - hole distance and an increase of the binding energy , compare figure  [ fig : energies - disorder ] .",

    "one can make the same observation for @xmath143 ( @xmath188 ) and for @xmath144 ( @xmath189 ) .",

    "therefore , the center of gravity of the distributions for the first excitation in figure  [ fig : spectra - hard - disorder ] is taken as representative for the position of the ` typical ' resonance @xmath192 with @xmath139 .",
    "these three energies as a function of nominal system size  @xmath4 are shown in figure  [ fig : graph - hard - disorder ] ( dotted line ) , together with the excitation energy of the ordered systems and the soft - disorder model .",
    "as expected , the energy of the ` typical ' excitation shifts further upwards with respect to the soft - disorder case and one observes the typical saturation effect .",
    "even though the effects of the longest chains have been overestimated , @xmath193 saturates quickly close the excitation energy for the shortest , unbroken chain @xmath194 as predicted by  @xcite .",
    "in this work it has been confirmed that the generic size - dependence of the excitation energy of the first optically allowed state for large , ordered oligoenes is purely quadratic in @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is most easily understood for the case of bound electron - hole pairs which can be described as independent particles in a box .",
    "thus the electron - electron interaction indeed introduces a new length scale , the electron - hole distance , @xmath111 , which one can easily deduce from the wave - function analysis .",
    "however , the generic scaling can only be seen when the system size is considerably larger than the electron - hole distance and the system is ordered .    `",

    "a linear fit in @xmath11 better describes the data for the excitation energy .",
    "however , this is accidental for ordered oligomers and mostly due to the applicability of taylor s theorem to smooth functions .",
    "in fact , a regular behavior can not be expected because two effects , binding and scattering of the pair by the boundaries , compete with each other for medium system sizes .",
    "this is even more the case for the smallest oligomers .",
    "soft disorder , e.g. , fluctuations in the bending angle between neighboring carbon atoms on single bonds , sets a length scale @xmath185 on which electron - hole pairs are localized .",
    "this localization leads to a hypsochromic shift in the excitation energies .",
    "one can also observe a redistribution of spectral weight due to symmetry breaking , and inhomogeneous broadening of spectral lines , as expected .",
    "additionally , the dependence of the excitation energies on @xmath11 clearly shows a linear term .",
    "the length scale @xmath185 slowly increases with nominal system size  @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is difficult to observe experimentally oligomers with the full nominal size",
    ". instead , on top of the soft disorder , there are kinks and impurities which effectively cut a long oligomer into segments of a typical size  @xmath13 so that oligomers of a typical length with a typical @xmath185 dominate the optical excitation spectrum .",
    "the chance to observe well - ordered long segments very slowly increases as a function of nominal chain length  @xmath4 .    in this work",
    "an interpretation scheme has been used for the excited - state wave functions which has been developed earlier  @xcite .",
    "this scheme is seen to work equally for ordered as well as disordered systems , for semi - empirical methods as well as for eph .",
    "moreover , the results indicate that the models for soft and hard disorder provide a suitable description of disorder in @xmath0-conjugated oligomers .",
    "this work did not aim at a quantitative description of the optical absorption of polymer films .",
    "for example , experimental data  @xcite suggest a much steeper descend of @xmath16 from @xmath119 to @xmath195 than can be described using the parameter sets * a * , * b * , and * c*. additionally , the electron - hole distance @xmath12 which is experimentally available via electro - absorption  @xcite , is not perfectly reproduced even though it is found to be of the right order of magnitude . an improved description for ordered polydiacetylenes , e.g. , with long - range interactions and polaronic relaxations , should remedy these shortcomings .",
