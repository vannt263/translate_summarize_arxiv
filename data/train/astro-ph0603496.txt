    "rr lyrae stars are of great astrophysical importance in many respects .",
    "they are standard candles of distance estimations , test objects of stellar evolution and pulsation model calculations .",
    "the physics governing their pulsation behavior is thought to be well understood , but there are still some puzzling properties of these objects as well .",
    "the most troublesome is the so called blazhko effect , the light curve modulation of some fraction of rr lyrae stars .",
    "@xcite gives an overall description of the phenomenon , and for a recent summary of the problems of theoretical explanations see @xcite .",
    "first connections between some properties of the pulsation and the modulation have been established in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the blazhko phenomenon has been known for about a century .",
    "most of the known galactic field rrab stars showing light curve modulation were discovered from photographic observations during the first part of the last century .",
    "though the advent of the photoelectric , and in the last decades of the 20 .",
    "century , the ccd era has led to spectacular increase of the photometric precision , there is still a lack of extended high accuracy survey of the modulation properties of the galactic field rr lyrae stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the statistics of the occurrence frequency of the phenomenon are contradictory , e.g. @xcite found 35% and 5% incidence rate for fundamental and first overtone variables in the galactic bulge , while @xcite and @xcite detected 11.9% and 7.5% of the rr lyrae stars to show modulation properties in the lmc , respectively . because of the differences in the accuracy of the surveys , the photometric wavebands used , the extension of the datasets , and the analyzing methods applied , exact comparison of the different statistics is , however , questionable .",
    "the recent discovery of the very small amplitude modulation of rr geminorum @xcite called our attention to that small amplitude modulations which have escaped notice in the previous photometric studies might be quite frequent .",
    "this possibility may override any previous statistics of the incidence rate of the modulation . in order to get a clear picture of the frequency of the modulation of galactic field rr lyrae stars",
    ", we started a systematic photometric survey at konkoly observatory to measure short period ( @xmath4 d ) fundamental mode rr lyrae stars .    in this note",
    "we report the discovery of another rr lyrae star , ss cnc ( @xmath5 , j2000 ) , exhibiting small amplitude modulation .",
    "previous photometric observations of ss cnc are very sparse , altogether 24 accurate photometric data points have been published by different authors @xcite .",
    "it is a metal rich rr lyrae star , its [ fe / h]@xmath6 ( see the metallicity compilation in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the observations were obtained with the automated 60 cm telescope of konkoly observatory , svbhegy , budapest equipped with a wright 750x1100 ccd using @xmath0 filters .",
    "the field of view was 17x24. data reduction was performed using standard iraf packages .",
    "nearly 1400 frames were obtained in each passband on 35 nights during the spring of 2005 ( between jd  2453388 and jd  2453467 ) .",
    "the data were transformed to standard @xmath7 magnitudes by using observations of standard stars in m67 @xcite .",
    "as no single comparison star with ideal properties ( brightness , color , vicinity ) has been found in the field we have measured relative magnitudes of ss cnc to the mean magnitudes of three stars : gsc 01927 - 00504 , gsc 01927 - 00744 , and gsc",
    "01927 - 00835 .",
    "the @xmath8 scatter of the averaged magnitude differences between these three stars is 0.008 , 0.009 , 0.009 , and 0.009 mag in the @xmath7 colors , respectively .",
    "relative magnitudes of ss cnc are available in machine readable format at the http:/www.konkoly.hu/24/publications/ web address .",
    "the observed pulsation light curve of ss cnc ( see fig .  [ figlc ] ) shows larger scatter than observational inaccuracies could explain . fitting the light curve only with the pulsation frequency and its harmonics",
    "the @xmath8 scatter of the residual data is 2 - 3 times larger than expected , 0.028 , 0.022 , 0.017 and 0.014 mag in the @xmath9 colors , respectively .    the brightness of maximum light varied from night to night , indicating blazhko modulation of the light curve .",
    "detailed fourier analysis of the data has revealed that this is indeed the case , but the modulation period of ss cnc is unexpectedly short , only 5.309 d. in fig .",
    "[ figmind ] @xmath10 observations are plotted against hjd and the phase of the detected short period modulation",
    ".    the pulsation and modulation periods ( mean values obtained for the @xmath9 data ) have been determined from fourier analysis , using the facilities of the program package mufran @xcite .",
    "we have detected 24 harmonics of the pulsation frequency ( @xmath11 c / d ) in the fourier spectrum of the @xmath2 light curve , and modulation peaks up to the 15th and 9th orders at smaller and larger frequency values than the pulsation components , respectively ( see fig .  [ figsp ] ) .",
    "the positions of the side lobe modulation frequencies ( @xmath12 ) correspond to @xmath13 c / d , i.e. , 5.309 d period of the modulation .",
    "the following ephemerides give maximum pulsation light and maximum amplitude timings :    hjd @xmath14 ,    hjd @xmath15 .",
    "the amplitudes ( @xmath16 ) and phases ( @xmath17 ) of the detected frequencies of the @xmath2 light curve and @xmath18 and @xmath19 amplitude ratios and @xmath20 and @xmath21 phase differences are listed in table  [ tablefour ] .",
    "the phases correspond to sine term solutions with initial epoch value : @xmath22 .",
    "the amplitudes of the modulation side lobe frequencies ( @xmath12 ) are strongly asymmetric , the smaller frequency components ( @xmath23 ) have significantly larger amplitudes than the longer frequency ones ( @xmath24 ) . with the exception of the second order",
    ", the amplitudes of the @xmath24 components do not exceed 0.005 mag in @xmath2 band .",
    "this order of magnitude signal definitely escapes detection in the case of less extended datasets and/or worse s / n ratio .",
    "this result warns that the classification scheme of the modulation which is based on that the modulation side lobe frequencies are present only at one side of the pulsation components ( @xmath25 variables ) or at both sides ( blazhko variables ) might be seriously affected by data incompleteness and s / n properties .",
    "a similar conclusion has already been drawn in @xcite based on that the fourier spectra of the two halves of the extended dataset of rr gem show substantially different character of the modulation . according to the data sampling and accuracy of the existing photometric surveys",
    ", ss cnc would have been classified as a @xmath25 variable if its modulation had been detected at all .",
    "our multicolor photometric observations of ss cnc and rr gem @xcite are extended enough to study and to compare the modulation characteristics of these stars in detail .",
    "though both stars exhibit modulation with extremely short period and small amplitude their modulation properties are different in many respects .    removing the mean pulsation light curves from the @xmath2 data the residual light curves against the pulsation phases",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ figres ] for both stars .",
    "these plots indicate only slight similarity , while the residual plot of rr gem is symmetrical to phase 0.5 ( which corresponds to the mid of the rising branch in both plots ) , there is no symmetry in the residual data of ss cnc .",
    "the only similarity of the two plots is that large modulation amplitude is restricted to a narrow phase interval in the vicinity of phase 0.5 .",
    "similar residual phase plot of dr and , a large modulation amplitude blazhko star was shown in @xcite .",
    "the modulation is the largest on the ascending branch of dr and , too , but increased modulation extends to a wider , 0.4 pulsation phase interval .",
    "the residual light curves of the blazhko variables give some impression about the character of the modulation . in case of pure amplitude modulation",
    "the residual is the largest at around minimum and maximum light and it is the smallest at around mean brightness values . on the contrary ,",
    "pure phase modulation results in large residual amplitude at around mid brightnesses and small residual amplitudes around the extrema . based on these properties fig .",
    "[ figres ] indicates that in ss cnc phase modulation does also occur , while in rr gem the amplitude modulation is dominant .",
    "the data coverage enabled us to analyze the displacement of the extrema and the shape of the light curves in the different phases of the blazhko cycle separately . in order to do this ,",
    "we have divided the @xmath2 dataset of the two stars into ten - ten subsets , each containing data of a full pulsation light curve but in different phase intervals of the blazhko cycle .",
    "( in ss cnc there is a 0.2 pulsation phase gap in one of these light curves which was filled by linear interpolation of the data subsets of the preceding and following blazhko phases . )    the variations in the heights and phases of the maxima in 10 different blazhko phases are shown in fig .",
    "[ amp - phase ] for the two stars . from these plots",
    "it is evident that in both stars both amplitude and phase modulation occur , but , indeed , in rr gem amplitude modulation is dominant .",
    "maxima timings precede the expected value the most at around the largest amplitude phase of the blazhko cycle both in ss cnc and in rr gem .    in fig .",
    "[ figres10 ] the residual light curves of ss cnc in the 10 different phases of the blazhko cycle are separately plotted .",
    "again , it is evident that large amplitude modulation occurs in a restricted phase interval around phase 0.5 .",
    "this concentration of the modulation to a narrow phase interval of the pulsation results in enhanced amplitudes of the higher order modulation components .",
    "[ figamp ] compares the amplitude decrease of the pulsation and modulation frequency components with increasing harmonic orders of the two stars .",
    "in contrast to the exponential amplitude decrease of the pulsation components , the amplitudes of the modulation frequencies decrease less steeply .",
    "another interesting feature is that , though the @xmath26 and @xmath27 components have the same amplitudes in rr gem and are significantly different in ss cnc , the mean values of the amplitudes at a given order are very similar in the two stars .",
    "it is also important to note that @xmath3 appears with commensurable amplitude like the first modulation frequencies in both cases .",
    "the fourier parameters of the pulsation light curves of the 10 data subsets for ss cnc and rr gem are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figfour ] .",
    "rr gem shows the largest variation in the fourier amplitudes and amplitude ratios ( @xmath28 ) during the blazhko cycle , while most of the fourier parameters of ss cnc vary significantly .",
    "these properties reflect also that amplitude modulation is dominant in rr gem , while in ss cnc both amplitude and phase modulation have significant amplitudes .",
    "an interesting feature of ss cnc is that the variation in the amplitude ratios and the phase differences ( @xmath29 ) are not harmonized in phase .",
    "it is worth noting that the amplitude of the variation increases towards the higher order phase differences .    as both ss cnc and rr gem",
    "were used as calibrating objects of the light curve  physical parameter relations of fundamental mode rr lyrae stars , we have also checked how the detected changes in the fourier parameters influence the value of the derived physical parameters .",
    "the calculated [ fe / h ] values in the different blazhko phases vary by about 0.2 according to the formula which involves the period and @xmath30 @xcite . in the calculated absolute brightness values",
    "( using the formula derived for @xmath31 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) there are less than 0.02 mag differences for both of the stars .",
    "these values have the same order of magnitudes if compared to the estimated accuracies of the formulae",
    ". we can thus conclude that small amplitude modulation of rrab stars probably does not influence severely the applicability of the light curve  physical parameter formulae .",
    "it was already shown in @xcite that in contrast with theoretical expectations the amplitude ratios and the phase differences of the @xmath24 and @xmath23 modulation side lobe component pairs in the different colors and orders do not have the same value .",
    "the largest deviations of the four colors and the first five harmonic orders are 0.25 in the amplitude ratios and @xmath32 in the phase differences in rr gem .",
    "these differences are substantially larger , 3.1 and @xmath33 in ss cnc , respectively .",
    "there are slight , but significant differences between the results in the four colors of the same order , and unexpectedly large differences between the different order s data .",
    "the intensity mean color changes during the blazhko cycle indicate some tens of degrees mean effective temperature changes of rr gem @xcite .",
    "the star seems to be slightly cooler in its smaller amplitude state than when its pulsation amplitude is larger .",
    "[ figszin ] shows the magnitude and intensity mean @xmath34 and @xmath35 magnitudes and colors in the different phases of the blazhko cycle of ss cnc .",
    "the means are defined as the zero point term of the fourier fits of the full pulsation light curves in each blazhko phase interval .",
    "these values have been determined for the @xmath36 light curves in the different blazhko phases , and the mean colors correspond to the differences of the mean magnitudes in the different wavelength bands .",
    "the accuracy of the mean magnitudes is estimated to be around 0.001 - 0.002 mag .",
    "both the intensity and magnitude mean @xmath2 brightnesses of ss cnc vary during the blazhko cycle .",
    "their amplitudes are about 0.012 - 0.015 mag .",
    "the brightest and faintest states occur about 0.1 - 0.3 blazhko phase after the phases of maximum and minimum amplitudes , respectively .",
    "the @xmath37 color index does not show systematic variation but its 0.005 - 0.007 mag scatter is larger than expected from the estimated accuracy of the data .",
    "the @xmath38 shows less than 0.01 mag amplitude variation in line with the changes of the mean @xmath2 brightness .",
    "it was a matter of debate for long whether the modulation frequency has observable amplitude in blazhko stars at all .",
    "@xcite and @xcite detected 0.011 and 0.005 mag amplitudes of the modulation frequency in the @xmath1 data of the two large modulation amplitude blazhko stars , rv uma and rs boo . during the modulation period",
    "the average brightness varies with an overall amplitude of 0.006 mag in 731 blazhko variables in the lmc @xcite .",
    "we have detected 0.006 and 0.008 mag @xmath1 amplitudes of the modulation frequency of rr gem and ss cnc , respectively .",
    "these results indicate that it is a general property of blazhko stars that @xmath3 have similar amplitudes of the order of or less than 0.01 mag , independently of the amplitude and other characteristics of the modulation .",
    "this is in contrast with the large variety of the amplitudes of the @xmath12 modulation components , which exceed even 0.1 mag in some cases ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another peculiarity of the @xmath3 frequency component is summarized in table  [ tablerat ] .",
    "this table lists the amplitude ratios and phase differences of the different color curve solutions for the modulation ( @xmath3 ) , and for the mean values of the pulsation ( @xmath39 ) , and modulation side lobe frequencies ( @xmath12 ) for ss cnc and rr gem .",
    "there are no differences in the mean values of the amplitude ratios and phase differences of the pulsation and modulation side lobe frequency values of the two stars , they have the same values within the range of the scatter of the values for the different harmonic orders of the same star .",
    "the amplitude ratios detected for @xmath3 are , however , significantly different from these values . towards redder colors",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath3 are much smaller for ss cnc and much larger for rr gem than detected for all the other frequency components",
    ". the @xmath40 amplitude ratios of @xmath3 are the less deviant , but for ss cnc it is definitely smaller than the @xmath40 amplitude ratios of the other frequency components .",
    "it is a natural expectation that the physics of the light variation determine the amplitude ratios in different colors .",
    "therefore , the different color dependence of the amplitudes of @xmath3 and the similarity of the amplitude ratios of the pulsation and modulation side lobe frequencies indicate that @xmath3 has basically different physical origin than the radial mode pulsation has , while the side lobe frequencies share somehow the properties of the pulsation .",
    "if nonlinear interaction between a millimagnitude amplitude signal ( @xmath3 ) and the two orders of magnitude larger amplitude pulsation calls forth to the appearance of the side lobe frequencies , then the properties of the combination frequencies would more probably inherit the properties of the dominant pulsation frequencies than those of the small amplitude signal .",
    "this result if strengthened by detailed observations of other blazhko stars may lead to the conclusion that the real physically reasonable frequency of the modulation is in fact @xmath3 .",
    "any interpretation of the modulation which is connected to nonradial mode frequencies excited in the vicinity of the radial mode pulsation frequency may have difficulties to explain the discrepant behavior of @xmath3 , which might question the validity of the identification of any of the side lobe frequencies with a nonradial mode frequency .",
    "based on our photometric investigation of ss cnc , and the previous study of rr gem we add the following empirical facts to our knowledge of the modulation properties of rrab stars .",
    "* small amplitude modulations with fourier amplitudes of the modulation frequency components of the order of millimagnitudes can be detected in rrab stars . *",
    "the amplitude decrease of the modulation components towards higher harmonic orders is significantly less steep than the amplitude decrease of the harmonic components of the pulsation .",
    "* the changes of the fourier parameters of the pulsation light curve in the different blazhko phases are star by star different .",
    "* based on the variations of the mean colors during the blazhko cycle the mean effective temperatures of the stars vary by less than @xmath41 k. * the color dependences of the amplitudes and phases of the pulsation and modulation side lobe frequencies are the same in the different harmonic orders for the two small modulation amplitude stars , but the modulation frequency itself ( @xmath3 ) shows significantly different color behavior .    these items , though still do not solve the mystery of the blazhko phenomenon add important contributions to our knowledge of the modulation properties of rrab stars , which have to be explained by any valid physical description . as a concluding remark",
    "we also emphasize that the discovery of small amplitude modulations questions the validity of any previous statistics on the occurrence of the modulation . based on accurate , detailed photometric data",
    "we also think that the current classification of the modulation into @xmath42 and blazhko types according to the amplitudes of the modulation side lobe frequencies is just an artifact of noisy data and bad data sampling .    up to now",
    "4 galactic field blazhko stars are known with modulation periods shorter than 20 days : ss cnc , rr gem , ah cam @xcite , and cz lac @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the modulation period only of the short pulsation period rrab stars can be anomalously short .",
    "a common feature of these stars is that they are all metal rich , with metallicity close to the solar value .",
    "however , metallicity does not have a definite effect on the period of the modulation .",
    "metal rich , short pulsation period blazhko stars with long modulation periods do also exist , e.g. , the modulation period of rs boo is 530 days ( @xmath43 d , [ fe / h]@xmath44 ) .",
    "an important result of our investigations is the demonstration of the discrepant behavior of the modulation frequency , @xmath3 itself .",
    "the invariance of its amplitude in blazhko stars and the discrepant color dependence of the amplitudes of this component indicate that the triggering mechanism of the light variations with the modulation period is basically different than that of the radial mode pulsation .",
    "the amplitudes of the side lobe modulation frequencies have the same color dependence as the pulsation frequencies have suggesting that these components are physically better connected to the radial mode .",
    "the explanations of the blazhko phenomenon involving nonradial modes do not give a clear picture yet .",
    "@xcite have found many unstable low degree ( @xmath45 ) nonradial @xmath46-modes of high radial order ( @xmath47 ) in rr lyrae models .",
    "these modes have frequencies in the vicinity of the frequencies of the observed radial modes . however , there is no indication in the literature , that the low frequency domain ( @xmath48 c / d ) would have been searched for unstable nonradial modes as well . the only model which explains the existence of the side lobe frequencies and is more or less in accordance with observations identifies these frequencies with rotation induced @xmath49 pairs @xcite .",
    "this model can not explain , however , the observed high amplitudes and the strong asymmetry of the triplets @xcite .",
