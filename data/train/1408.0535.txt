    "a cup of hot coffee and a glass of cold beer empirically thermalize to room temperature if they are left out .",
    "this conventional description of thermalization assumes an infinitely large ` reservoir ' with which an initially out - of - equilibrium system can exchange energy ( and particles if allowed ) to achieve thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , this does not describe thermalization of an _ isolated _ system .",
    "when a large isolated system thermalizes , what happens is that small subsystems thermalize , with the remainder of the full system serving as the reservoir .",
    "the question of how this works for a quantum many - body system undergoing linear unitary time evolution has a long history ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and has attracted renewed attention due to experimental realizations of such systems  @xcite .    even though unitary quantum time - evolution is reversible and retains all information about the initial state",
    ", thermalization can occur if one restricts observations to only few - body operators , and can not access the full many - body density operator .",
    "this occurs because all the information in the initial state spreads over the entire system in the long - time limit , and its reconstruction requires access to the full many - body density operator .",
    "the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) has been proposed as the underlying mechanism for thermalization in isolated quantum systems based on random matrix  @xcite and semiclassical  @xcite arguments .",
    "eth states that within the eigenstates of a nonintegrable ( quantum chaotic ) hamiltonian , few - body operators have thermal distributions in the thermodynamic limit , _",
    "i.e. _ the same probability distributions as the boltzmann - gibbs ensemble at the corresponding temperature .",
    "numerical tests of the eth have recently been performed for a wide variety of nonintegrable models @xcite . in every case",
    ", good numerical evidence is provided that the deviation of a typical eigenstate from thermal value decreases towards zero as the size of the system is increased , as expected from the eth .",
    "however , most of these studies only test that _",
    "almost all _ energy eigenstates obey the eth , while eth is actually expected to make the stronger claim that _ all _ eigenstates away from the edges of the many - body spectrum are thermal in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "this difference is of fundamental importance , because it is also the difference between _",
    "almost all _ initial states approaching thermal equilibrium , and _ all _ initial states doing so .",
    "some previous works have tested whether all eigenstates obey eth by analyzing the mismatch between eigenstate expectation values and microcanonical ensemble averages @xcite .    in this paper , we provide more numerical evidence that _ all _ eigenstates obey eth for two one - dimensional nonintegrable models : an ising chain with transverse and longitudinal fields and hard - core bosons at half - filling with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor hopping and interaction . we also show that driving the ising chain periodically in time , which removes the conservation of total energy , makes its eigenstates obey eth more closely for a given finite - size system .",
    "one remark is in order .",
    "there are two notable exceptions to eth ; integrable systems and many - body localized ( mbl ) systems .",
    "an integrable system has an extensive number of local conservation laws .",
    "therefore , the conventional gibbs ensemble is not enough to fix the probability distributions of few - body operators .",
    "it is conjectured that distributions of few - body operators in integrable systems are given by the generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) @xcite , however some recent papers report insufficiencies of the gge in certain cases @xcite .",
    "many - body localization happens when quenched disorder is strong enough in an interacting system ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in a mbl phase , individual many - body eigenstates are localized and violate eth @xcite , due to localized conserved observables .",
    "although integrable systems and mbl systems are exciting and currently very active topics of research , we restrict ourselves to disorder - free , robustly nonintegrable systems throughout this paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we develop an eth indicator to investigate the strong eth and describe the two models investigated in our study . in section iii , using exact diagonalization , we conduct an ` outlier ' analysis .",
    "the outlier states are the energy eigenstates that deviate the most from the predictions of eth .",
    "we show that even these outlier states converge towards eth behavior as we increase the system size .",
    "we also investigate some properties such as the momenta and the participation ratios of the ` outlier ' states . in section iv",
    ", we periodically drive the ising chain by two sets of non - commuting operators in the hamiltonian and study the eigenstates of the corresponding floquet operator , which are thermal at infinite temperature @xcite . again doing an outlier analysis",
    ", we show that the eigenstates of the floquet operator of a finite chain deviate from eth significantly less than do the eigenstates of the corresponding time - independent hamiltonian ( and of course these deviations vanish in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "given a time - independent hamiltonian @xmath0 and an out - of - equilibrium initial state @xmath1 , we write the expectation value of a few - body operator @xmath2 at time @xmath3 ( the planck constant @xmath4 is set to unity throughout this paper ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the matrix elements of the initial state @xmath1 and the operator @xmath2 in the energy eigenbasis and @xmath8 is the eigenenergy for eigenstate @xmath9 . assuming no degeneracies , off - diagonal terms dephase in the long time limit and eq .",
    "approaches a stationary value in the thermodynamic limit for a broad class of out - of - equilibrium initial states @xcite .",
    "the stationary value @xmath10 is the sum of diagonal elements and thus time - independent : @xmath11 thus , at long time the system _",
    "` equilibrates ' _ , but does not necessarily thermalize .",
    "examples of systems that can ` equilibrate ' but not thermalize include many - body localized systems @xcite .",
    "being thermalized is a stronger statement , which means that in the thermodynamic limit the equilibrium value is equal to the average in the corresponding thermal ensemble . assuming that the energy is the only extensive conserved quantity , which fixes the temperature ( and its inverse @xmath12 ) , thermalization means the equilibrated value is equal to the thermal ( canonical ( c ) and microcanonical ( mc ) ) value : @xmath13 where total energy @xmath14 and the inverse temperature @xmath12 are related by @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a macroscopically small energy @xmath17 sets the microcanonical energy window , and @xmath18 is the number of eigenstates in the window . equation  , when true , implies that _ any _ initial state with the same energy density should thermalize the operator @xmath2 to the _ same _ thermal equilibrium value .",
    "assuming that the above statement is true for _ all _ initial states , we may consider an extreme situation : the initial state is an energy eigenstate ( @xmath19 ) , which is time - independent so must be thermalized .",
    "thus it follows that in the thermodynamic limit _ the expectation value of every few - body operator in every energy eigenstate is the thermal value_. this highly nontrivial statement is the essence of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) @xcite .",
    "sometimes this is called ` strong eth ' ( _ every _ eigenstate ) , in contrast to ` weak eth ' where some small number of eigenstates are not thermal @xcite .    one necessary condition of eth is that the diagonal elements , @xmath20 , depend only on the eigenenergy @xcite .",
    "therefore , after sorting the eigenstates by energy ( @xmath21 ) , we consider the following quantity : @xmath22 if eth is true , this quantity should be exponentially small in the system size , because the energy difference between adjacent eigenenergies is exponentially small . since the typical magnitude of @xmath23 depends on the density of states at energy @xmath8",
    ", we consider only a ` central ' half of the eigenstates in the spectrum of @xmath0 , where the variation in the density of states is small ( see appendix a ) . in section iii , we examine various aspects of the parameter @xmath23 , its distribution , its largest absolute values , and features of the corresponding ` outlier ' eigenstates .",

    "we choose @xmath47 , for which this model is known to be nonintegrable  @xcite .    as few - body operators , we look at the three two - site operators @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , which form a basis of the observables acting on two neighboring sites whose expectation values in simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath0 and momentum are not simply dictated by this system s symmetries and conservation laws .",
    "we only consider @xmath51 , since we look only at eigenstates of momentum . for this model",
    ", the expectation values of all of the one - site operators do not vary between these eigenstates , and thus are not of interest for this study of eth .",
    "we first write each hamiltonian in block - diagonal form in the momentum basis and diagonalize each momentum sector .",
    "then we collect results from all momenta and sort the exact many - body eigenstates in ascending order of energy .",
    "although level statistics should be carried out within each momentum sector , eth should be valid regardless of discrete symmetries @xcite . since the eigenstates with positive and negative momenta map on to one another under time reversal , we only diagonalize non - negative momenta @xmath52 . a state with momentum @xmath53 has eigenvalue @xmath54 under the operator that translates the system by one lattice spacing .",
    "the lengths of the systems we diagonalize are @xmath46 = 12 to 19 ( 18 for the floquet operator ) for model 1 , and even @xmath46 s from 14 to 22 for model 2 .",

    "the fluctuations become smaller as the system size increases . ]",
    "figure [ expectation ] shows the expectation values in each energy eigenstate vs.  its energy density .",
    "it is clear that as we increase the system size ( approaching the thermodynamic limit ) , these fluctuations reduce and the expectation value becomes a smooth function of energy density .",
    "this is in a good agreement with eth predictions .",
    "note that refs .",
    "@xcite shows the fluctuations are not small in an integrable system .",
    "next , we compute the distribution of @xmath57 ( state index @xmath9 is omitted when the meaning is straightforward ) and see how it behaves as we increase the system size .",
    "figure [ distribution ] is the plot of the distributions of @xmath57 .",
    "we see that the distribution becomes sharply peaked at @xmath59 for a larger system size , which is consistent with eth .",
    "to quantify the fluctuations , we consider the average of @xmath60 ( the average of @xmath23 is basically zero ) .",
    "note that @xmath23 is an indicator of eth without microcanonical averaging , thus it can be considered as an extreme version of the indicator introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite that is averaged over a small energy window . as we can see in figure [ outliers ] , the mean value of @xmath57 decreases exponentially with the system size ( thus a power - law decay with the hilbert space dimension ) , in accordance with eth @xcite .    .",
    "( a ) ising hamiltonian ( eq .  ) , and ( b ) hard - core boson hamiltonian ( eq .  ) . as we increase the system size , the distribution becomes sharply peaked near @xmath59 .",
    "the distribution can be well - fitted by a gaussian distribution ( only positive argument ) with a standard deviation @xmath61 decreasing exponentially with the system size @xmath46 . ]",
    "as long as the thermodynamic limit of the distribution @xmath62 is the dirac delta function @xmath63 , the conventional microcanonical formulation of equilibrium statistical mechanics is valid , since averaging a few - body operator over a microcanonical ensemble , which still includes exponentially many states even in a narrow energy window , should be equal to the canonical ensemble average .",
    "therefore , figure [ distribution ] provides numerical evidence of the validity of equilibrium statistical mechanics for these isolated quantum systems .",
    "this feature is also confirmed by several previous works @xcite .",
    "this implies that _ almost all _ out - of - equilibrium initial states will eventually equilibrate and thermalize in terms of the expectation values of few - body operators .",
    "this is enough for all practical purposes , since it is impossible to precisely manipulate highly - excited many - body states . sometimes , this is called `` weak eth '' .    here",
    "we ask whether there could be some small number of eigenstates with nonzero finite values of @xmath23 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "such ` outlier ' states if sufficiently rare would not contribute to the microcanonical ensemble average , and thus not compromise standard equilibrium statistical mechanics",
    ". however , eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is stricter : _ every _ eigenstate is thermal .",
    "this is sometimes referred as `` strong eth '' .",
    "strong eth requires that _ every _ @xmath23 approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit .       and the mean value @xmath64 . ( a ) ising hamiltonian ( eq .  ) , and ( b ) hard - core boson ( eq .  ) .",
    "the mean value @xmath64 decreases exponentially in @xmath46 as eth suggests @xcite .",
    "the largest ` outliers ' also decrease , although slower than @xmath64 , with the system size . ]",
    "we introduce one way to numerically test the strong eth : the outliers .",
    "we define the outliers as the eigenstates that deviate the most from eth and thus give large values of @xmath60 .",
    "since each @xmath23 comes from two states , a large @xmath60 means either one state is an outlier and the other one is `` normal '' or both states are outliers of opposite signs .",
    "this also implies that the indicator @xmath60 does not detect the special case where two outliers of the same sign are consecutive in the energy spectrum , resulting in a small @xmath60 .",
    "in such a case , however , both @xmath65 and @xmath66 should be large so we can easily identify the outliers @xcite . usually , we find one outlier state next to many normal states . therefore , there are no difficulties in spotting these outlier states .",
    "if the strong eth is correct , even the largest value of @xmath60 should decrease to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "figure [ outliers ] shows the 1st , 2nd , 4th , and 8th largest values of @xmath60 and the mean value of @xmath60 .",
    "it is clear that the mean value @xmath64 ( averaged over half of the spectrum ) decreases exponentially with the system size .",
    "this shows that our ( isolated ) quantum models agree well with the microcanonical formulation of equilibrium statistical mechanics , as explained earlier .",
    "the central feature of figure [ outliers ] is that even the largest value of @xmath57 decreases with the system size . extrapolating this tendency",
    ", we provide supporting evidence for the strong eth , that every eigenstate far away from the edge of the spectrum is thermal as far as the expectation values of few - body operators are concerned .",
    "now let us examine these outlier states .",
    "table [ outlier_table_ising ] is the list of the 1st , 2nd , 4th , and 8th outlier states and their properties of four few - body operators for the ising hamiltonian ( eq .  ) with @xmath46 = 18 .",
    "we consider three features ; ( 1 ) the location of the outlier state in the list of the states considered sorted by energy in ascending order ( state @xmath67 ) , ( 2 ) participation ratio ( pr ) , ( 3 ) and momentum @xmath53 .",
    "( 1 ) : the state number tells us where the outliers are located in the spectrum .",
    "it shows that the outlier states may come from any place in the spectrum , which implies that their presence is not strongly sensitive to the small changes in the density of states over the energy range we are studying .",
    "another feature is that different operators do share outlier states : states @xmath67 70164 and 8033 are the two most extreme outlier states for all of @xmath55 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , but are not outlier states for @xmath70 .",
    "we have checked the 30 most extreme outlier states for @xmath46 = 18 and it turns out that @xmath55 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 share many outlier states , while @xmath71 seldom has common outlier states with the other operators .    .ising hamiltonian ( eq .  ) .",
    "list of 1st , 2nd , 4th and 8th outliers for four few - body operators and their state @xmath67 , participation ratio ( pr ) , and the momentum of the state ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the state @xmath67 is the location of the state in the list of the analyzed states sorted by ascending order in energy .",
    "for @xmath46 = 18 , total 72821 states are considered . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     \\(2 ) and ( 3 ) : the participation ratio ( pr ) quantifies how delocalized a state is in a certain basis @xcite .",
    "here we write each eigenstate in the @xmath28 basis for the ising model , and in the @xmath72 basis for the boson model . then , for a given eigenstate @xmath73 ( @xmath74 is the hilbert space dimension , @xmath75 are the basis states ) , the pr is @xmath76 when the state is completely delocalized , each @xmath77 and thus pr = @xmath74 .",
    "if the state is totally localized on only one basis state , then pr = 1 .",
    "thus the pr is a measure of how many basis states the state is delocalized over .",
    "there are two special momenta , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which preserve the system s time - reversal symmetry ( for odd @xmath46 , only @xmath80 exists ) .",
    "these two momentum sectors have an additional discrete symmetry , spatial inversion , and thus each eigenstate in these sectors is either even or odd under this symmetry .",
    "consequently , this extra discrete symmetry prevents these special momentum eigenstates from exploring all basis states , and results in a smaller pr than the states with the other momenta . for @xmath46 = 18 ,",
    "the average pr of the central half spectrum with momenta @xmath81 is 8.53@xmath82 with standard deviation 0.59@xmath83 , while the average pr of states with momenta @xmath78 and @xmath84 is 5.55@xmath82 with standard deviation 0.45@xmath83 @xcite .",
    "therefore , these special momentum states are less ergodic and are good candidates for outliers . as we can see in table [ outlier_table_ising ] , many ( but not all ) outliers do have small pr compared to the average value of pr for their momenta , which implies these states are less uniformly delocalized than typical states . also , outlier states tend to come from the special time - reversal - symmetric momenta , as expected .",
    "nevertheless , figure [ outliers ] indicates that even these extreme outlier states seem to obey eth in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the tendencies of outlier states are similar for other @xmath46 s .",
    "table [ outlier_table_boson ] is the list of outlier states and their pr and momenta for the boson hamiltonian ( eq .  ) with @xmath85 .",
    "the average pr for @xmath78 and @xmath86 is @xmath87 with standard deviation @xmath88 , and the average for the other @xmath53 s is @xmath89 with standard deviation @xmath90 .",
    "again , many of the outlier states are from the special momenta ( @xmath78 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "but in contrast to the ising model , the pr s of extreme outliers are not much lower than the averages .",
    "this indicates that the pr need not be extreme in outlier states @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the lowest pr state for the boson hamiltonian ( @xmath92 for @xmath46 = 20 ) is not extreme in the @xmath57 measure for these few - body operators , while the lowest pr state in the ising hamiltonian ( state @xmath67 = 70164 in table [ outlier_table_ising ] ) is an outlier in @xmath57 for most of the few - body operators we examined .",
    "note that the local current operator @xmath93 is odd under time - reversal symmetry and thus has zero expectation value for all states that are symmetric under time reversal .",
    "therefore , @xmath78 and @xmath91 states can not have outliers of @xmath93 .",
    "since these special momentum states are not outliers for this operator , it has smaller value of extreme @xmath57 s ( see appendix b for extreme values ) .    in figure [ outliers](a ) , there is an alternation between even and odd @xmath46 in outlier values of @xmath57 .",
    "we attribute this to the number of special momenta .",
    "even chains have two special momenta ( @xmath78 and @xmath91 ) , while odd chains have only @xmath80 .",
    "as we see from table [ outlier_table_ising ] , these special momentum states tend to have more extreme outliers .",
    "since even chains have more such states , it is natural that they tend to have higher extreme values of @xmath57 .",
    "nevertheless , once we decompose the data by the parity of @xmath46 , we see that the largest value of @xmath57 decreases monotonically with @xmath46 for both even and odd @xmath46 .",
    "few - body conservation laws put constraints on a system s dynamics that can slow down or impede thermalization .",
    "one example is integrable systems that have many such conservation laws and thus do not fully thermalize @xcite .",
    "our ising model has only one few - body conservation law , which is the energy ( its hamiltonian is a sum of one- and two - body operators ) .",
    "thus , we can ask what happens to thermalization when we remove energy conservation , so that the system has no few - body conserved quantity .",
    "[ note that these systems always have all the many - body conserved operators that are the projections on to the system s eigenstates . ]",
    "one way to remove energy conservation but still have eigenstates of the dynamics is to have a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath94 that is periodic in time , so @xmath95 .",
    "we can divide the ising hamiltonian ( eq .  ) into two parts , one with only @xmath96 operators ( @xmath97 ) and one with only @xmath98 operators ( @xmath99 ) . during one period @xmath100",
    ", we have @xmath101 for the first @xmath102 and then @xmath103 for the remaining @xmath102 .",
    "then , the unitary floquet operator that takes the system through one period is @xmath104    the eigenvalues of @xmath105 are complex numbers of magnitude one . on the complex unit circle ,",
    "the level spacing statistics of the eigenvalues follow the ` circular orthogonal ensemble ' @xcite .",
    "references @xcite report that when this sort of many - body floquet system thermalizes , it thermalizes a generic initial state to the ` infinite temperature ' ensemble ( all states of each small subsystem equally probable ) .",
    "therefore , if the strong eth is applicable to this floquet system , every eigenstate of @xmath105 should be thermal at infinite temperature .    here",
    "we perform the same outlier analysis for eigenstates of @xmath105 with the few - body operator @xmath55 .",
    "since the expectation value of @xmath55 at infinite temperature is zero , we need not compare expectation values of adjacent states and instead just evaluate the absolute value of the expectation value in each eigenstate . furthermore , since the eigenvalues are well spread over the unit circle , we can use all eigenstates and need not search for a region where the density of states is roughly constant .",
    "we choose the period @xmath106 and use the same parameters @xmath107 as above .",
    "figure [ floquet ] shows the outliers and average value of the magnitude of the eigenstate expectation value @xmath108 . in comparison with figure [ outliers](a )",
    ", we can clearly see that the value of outliers and average value are smaller and approach eth predictions faster .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the floquet system , which has no local conservation law , thermalizes `` better '' ( by this measure ) than the nonintegrable hamiltonian system with energy conservation .",
    "the few - body operator is @xmath55 . the average value and the outlier values are substantially smaller than those of the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the floquet system satisfies eth more precisely for each system size @xmath46 . ]",
    "in this paper , we have done a stringent test of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis .",
    "we chose two popular nonintegrable model hamiltonians , well away from integrable points in their parameter spaces , and thoroughly investigated properties of eigenstate expectation values of several few - body operators .",
    "first , we introduced an indicator that measures deviation from eth behavior , and showed that these deviations decrease as we increase the system size .",
    "therefore , we recover some known results about eth @xcite",
    ". then , we examined the ` outlier ' eigenstates , that deviate the most from eth behavior .",
    "even these extreme states ( outliers ) approach eth behavior as the system size is increased .",
    "thus we provide numerical evidence in support of eth in its strong version : eth is true for _ all _ eigenstates .",
    "we analyzed the outlier states and showed outliers have relatively small participation ratio , which implies they are less delocalized in the many - body fock space than typical states .",
    "finally , we deliberately broke the energy conservation by making the hamiltonian time - dependent ( floquet system ) .",
    "we showed that the eigenstates of the floquet operator deviate from eth behavior by less than those of the corresponding time - independent hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the floquet system , which has no conserved energy to transport , thermalizes better .    many open questions still remain .",
    "first , we have only considered certain one - site and two - site operators .",
    "one could in principle search systematically over some complete set of few - body operators to find the operators that produce the most extreme outliers .",
    "we have not done this , so the possibility remains that eth might fail for the combination of special eigenstates and special few - body operators , although we see no reason to expect such a failure .",
    "second , we only looked at two models , and there might be some other nonintegrable models that would violate the strong eth .",
    "we know that strong eth is false for integrable models , while it appears to be true for the two strongly nonintegrable models we have studied .",
    "naively , we would expect that eth is restored in the thermodynamic limit as soon as the integrability is broken by some nonzero amount , but this remains an open question @xcite .",
    "we leave these interesting questions for future investigation .",

    "figure [ doe ] shows the densities of states over the energy range we kept .",
    "it shows that the variations in densities of states are small in this range ; the fractional difference between the largest and the smallest is less than 20@xmath114 .",
    "there is a small resulting tendency for the outliers to be more likely where the density of states is lower , but because the density of states is nearly constant over the range we examine , this is a small effect .",

    "therefore , all results support the strong eth .                                        for some models that are nonintegrable and thermal in the bulk of their many - body spectrum , there may be low - energy states just above the ground state ( and just below the highest - energy state ) that are asymptotically integrable and fail to obey the eth even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "particularly , in many one - dimensional systems the low - energy dynamics are known to be asymptotically integrable .",
    "thus when we say we are testing whether all eigenstates are thermal , we mean in the bulk of the many - body spectrum , excluding these possible special states near the edge of the spectrum .",
    "eth contains another statement that the off - diagonal elements , @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , are exponentially small in the hilbert space dimension @xmath74 @xcite , which makes their contribution to the long - time expectation value vanish for @xmath122 .",
