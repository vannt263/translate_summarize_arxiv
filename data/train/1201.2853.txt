    "renormalized energy \" , for some specific random point processes that arise in random matrix models , and in this way to associate to each of these processes a unique number , which is expected to measure its  disorder \" .",
    "our  renormalized energy \" , that we denote @xmath3 , is defined over configurations of points lying either on the real line or on the plane , as the limit as @xmath4 of @xmath5 } \\log \\left|2\\sin \\frac{\\pi(a_i - a_j ) } n\\right|   + \\log n\\qquad \\text{in dimension 1},\\\\ \\wc(\\{a_i\\ } ) &   = \\frac{1}{2\\pi n^2 }   \\sum_{i\\neq j , a_i , a_j \\in [ 0,n]^2 } e_n(a_i - a_j ) + \\log \\frac{n}{2\\pi \\eta(i)^2}\\qquad \\text{in dimension 2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is an explicit eisenstein series , and @xmath7 is the dedekind eta function .",
    "this definition is inspired by that of the  renormalized energy \" , denoted @xmath8 , introduced by sandier and the second author in @xcite in the case of points in the plane and in @xcite in the case of points on the real line .",
    "the definitions for @xmath8 and @xmath3 coincide when the point configuration has some periodicity ( this is where our new definition originates ) , and in that case they amount to computing a sum of pairwise interactions @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the points and @xmath11 is a suitable logarithmic kernel ( the green s function on the underlying torus ) ; however they are not identical in general",
    ". we will give more details on the connection in section [ secdefw ] .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that in dimension 1 , @xmath8 is bounded below and its minimum is achieved at the perfect lattice @xmath12 . in dimension 2 , the situation is more complex ; it is also shown in @xcite that the minimum of @xmath8 is achieved , but it is only conjectured that this minimum value is achieved at the perfect triangular lattice or  abrikosov lattice \" according to the terminology of the physics of superconductors ( which was the first main motivation for @xmath8 in @xcite where it was introduced ) .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the result that , among configurations of points which form a perfect lattice ( of fixed volume ) , the renormalized energy is minimal if and only if the lattice is the perfect triangular lattice , i.e. with 60@xmath13 angles ( that result is shown in @xcite based on the use of modular functions and results in number theory ) .",
    "it is thus natural to think of @xmath8 or @xmath3 as a way to measure the disorder of a configuration of points . with this outlook , in dimension 1",
    "the lattice @xmath12 is the most ordered configuration of points with prescribed density 1 , while in dimension 2 , it is expected to be the triangular lattice ( which is better ordered than any other lattice , say the square lattice ) .",
    "in addition , due to its logarithmic nature , @xmath3 has some nice scaling and additive properties , which we believe make it a very good object .",
    "a further motivation for choosing to study @xmath3 as opposed to any other total pairwise interaction function is that , as seen in @xcite and @xcite , @xmath8 arises very naturally from the statistical mechanics of coulomb or log gases , which contain as particular cases the ginibre and goe / gue / gse ensembles of random matrices . in @xcite , @xmath8",
    "was introduced and derived in the context of the minimization of the ginzburg - landau model of superconductivity . in @xcite it was derived as a sort of limiting interaction energy for two dimensional coulomb gases , and similarly in @xcite with log gases .",
    "these works are based on analysis and energy estimates ( upper and lower bounds ) .",
    "both the questions we pursue here and the methods we use are quite different : they aim at obtaining explicit formulas for specific random matrix models . in particular , this is a way to compute some interesting statistics over random matrix eigenvalues , as initiated by dyson - mehta @xcite .",
    "we will comment more on this just below .",
    "let us now briefly introduce the notion of a random point process .",
    "a ( simple ) random point process is a probability measure on the set of all locally finite collections of ( mutually distinct ) points in the space , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "it can also be viewed as a random measure of the form @xmath14 , with the points @xmath15 distinct and @xmath16 discrete .",
    "random point processes are essentially characterized by their ",
    "@xmath17-point correlation functions \" @xmath18 , which give the probability densities of finding @xmath17 points at the locations @xmath19 .",
    "we will normalize our processes so that the average number of points per unit volume is always @xmath20 , which is equivalent to @xmath21 .",
    "perhaps the most famous random point process is the poisson process , characterized by the facts that the number of points in disjoint subsets are independent , and the number of points in any finite volume subset of the space follows a poisson distribution with parameter equal to the volume of the set with respect to a reference measure . an important class of point processes is that of determinantal point processes , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein . that class is characterized by the fact that the @xmath17-point correlation functions are given by symmetric minors of a ( correlation ) kernel , cf .",
    "section [ correl ] .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath22 for the translation invariant poisson process , which means that it is `` too chaotic '' from the point of view of the renormalized energy .",
    "let us list the ( stationary ) processes for which we show that @xmath23 provides more meaningful information .",
    "we will be interested in one dimension in the @xmath0-sine processes ( @xmath1 ) which arise as the local limit of the law of eigenvalues in random matrix ensembles with orthogonal , unitary , and symplectic symmetry groups ( they are determinantal for @xmath2 and pfaffian otherwise ) . in two dimensions we will examine the  ginibre \" point process , which is also a determinantal process arising as the local limit of the law of eigenvalues of matrices from the complex ginibre ensemble ( i.e. square matrices with complex gaussian iid entries ) , for further reference , see @xcite ; as well as the random process of zeros of random gaussian analytic functions , often denoted gaf , whose description can be found in @xcite",
    ".    as our processes are always translation invariant , the @xmath24-point correlation function can always be written in the form @xmath25 for the 2-point _ cluster function _",
    "@xmath26 ( we will come back to this notation in sections [ correl ] and [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "the main results we obtain are the following :    * for general stationary processes we identify sufficient conditions on the process and its @xmath24-point correlation function @xmath27 for the existence of @xmath28 , and give an explicit formula in terms of @xmath27 which is ( up to constants ) @xmath29 with @xmath30 or @xmath24 according to the dimension . that we check for the above mentioned processes .",
    "we expect it to hold for general @xmath0-sine processes but we do not see an _ a priori _ reason for that . it is also not clear to us whether this condition has a physical meaning . ] * we apply this formula to the specific point processes mentioned above .",
    "* for the specific point processes above , we explicitly compute the limit of the variance of @xmath31 and obtain that it is @xmath32 .",
    "this implies that for such processes , @xmath31 concentrates around its expected value , and converges in probability to @xmath33 as @xmath4 .",
    "* we prove that in the class of determinantal point processes with translation invariant kernels in dimensions 1 and 2 , @xmath34 is minimized by the processes whose correlation kernel is the fourier transform of the characteristic function of the ball .",
    "a complete physical interpretation of this fact seems to be missing . in dimension 1",
    "the optimization gives the @xmath2 sine process , which can be seen as a heuristic explanation of the fact that this process is the universal local limit of @xmath2 random matrix ensembles .",
    "indeed , such a local limit has to be translation invariant and determinantal , and it is natural to expect that it also minimizes an appropriate energy functional . in other dimensions ,",
    "point processes with such specific kernels called  fermi - sphere point processes \" appear in @xcite as higher - dimensional analogues of the sine process .    for our set of specific processes , we thus show that we can attribute to the process a unique number , which we compute explicitly .",
    "whenever these numbers are distinct this implies that the processes are mutually singular ( as measures on the space of point configurations ) .",
    "moreover , we check that the processes that are expected to have the highest level of  order \" or rigidity indeed have a lower value of @xmath35 . for example for the @xmath0-sine processes we find @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the euler constant . these three numbers",
    "form a decreasing sequence , as can be expected .    in two dimensions",
    ", we obtain that the ginibre process has a higher @xmath38 , hence less rigidity , than that of zeros of gaussian analytic functions , in agreement with the results and philosophy of @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath39 for the @xmath1 sine processes above equal twice the thermodynamic `` energy per particle '' or `` mean internal energy '' for the log - gas with infinitely many particles , as obtained by dyson in 1962 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i.ix , iii.vi ) .",
    "this is not surprizing as our definition of @xmath31 essentially coincides with that of dyson ( * ? ? ? *",
    "i.vi ) once the points on the interval @xmath40 $ ] are identified with points on a circle of same length .",
    "furthermore , one can use this fact to infer finer asymptotic properties of @xmath31 as follows ( we are very grateful to peter forrester for the idea ) .",
    "if , instead of considering growing windows , one approximates the @xmath0-sine processes by the _",
    "circular ensembles _ of particles on the unit circle with joint probability density @xmath41 , one observes that in rescaled variables , @xmath31 is simply @xmath42 , and its characteristic function can be immediately obtained from selberg s formula for the partition function : @xmath43 see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.7.2 ) for the formula for @xmath44 . using stirling s formula",
    "it is not hard to see that for any @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath47 with @xmath48 and the expression of @xmath49 through the partition function @xmath44 coincides with that of the thermodynamic energy per particle . by lvy s continuity theorem",
    "this implies the central limit theorem @xmath50    it is natural to conjecture that the same central limit theorem holds for @xmath31 on general @xmath0-sine processes ( constructed in @xcite ) as well , in particular providing asymptotic values @xmath51 and @xmath52 for any @xmath45 . at the moment",
    "we do not know how to prove it , although in the @xmath1 cases one may hope to obtain a proof via controlling the asymptotics of moments of @xmath31 through explicit formulas for the correlation functions .    in the follow - up paper @xcite , prompted by the wish to analyze experimental data , dyson and",
    "mehta looked for a way of approximating the energy per particle , in the case @xmath53 , by averaging a statistic of the form @xmath54 over windows of increasing length in the random matrix spectrum .",
    "the concentration requirement of the asymptotically vanishing variance led them to the conclusion that with their choice of @xmath55 , the statistic had to be corrected with further interaction terms ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "( 109 ) ) .",
    "our renormalized energy @xmath31 seems to be a better solution to dyson - mehta s problem , although one should note that dyson - mehta s statistic is purely local , while @xmath31 involves long range interaction ( between leftmost and rightmost particles in @xmath56 $ ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secdefw ] we give the precise definitions of @xmath8 , the context about it and its connection to coulomb energy , from @xcite .",
    "this leads us to the definition of @xmath31 . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we compute limits of expectations of @xmath31 : first on the real line and for general processes , then for the @xmath1 sine processes , then in the plane and for general processes , finally for the explicit ginibre and zeros of gaf processes . in section [ optim ] we find minimizers of @xmath57 among determinantal processes with translation - invariant correlation kernels . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we compute the limit variance of @xmath31 for our specific processes ( and show it is @xmath32 ) . in section  [ sc : misc ] we gather some miscellaneous computations : the effect on @xmath58 of superposition and decimation of processes and the computation of expectation of @xmath58 for the @xmath2 discrete sine processes .",

    "the aim of this section is to present a definition of @xmath8 for a configuration of points either on the line or in the plane , which is directly deduced from that of @xcite , but depends only on the data of the points .",
