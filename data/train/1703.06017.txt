    "in recent years there has been growing evidence that many physical and biological system have no characteristic length scale and exhibit a power law correlation .",
    "traditional approaches such as power spectrum , correlation analysis are suited to quantify correlations in a stationary signal @xcite .",
    "however many signals that are output of complex physical @xcite and biological system are said to contain nonstationarity .",
    "almost all methods of time series analysis , traditional linear or nonlinear , must assume some kind of stationarity @xcite .",
    "a number of statistical tests for stationarity @xcite in a time series have been proposed in the literature .",
    "most of the tests we are aware of are based on ideas similar to the following : estimate a certain parameter using different parts of the sequence .",
    "if the observed variations are found to be significant , that is , outside the expected statistical fluctuations , the time series is regarded as nonstationary . in case of traces of nonstationarity",
    "being detected , we are allowed to carry out modified root mean square analysis termed as detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) @xcite .",
    "the advantages of dfa is that it permits the detection of long range correlation embedded in a seemingly non- stationary time series and allows the detection of scaling exponent in noisy signal with embedded trend that can mask the true correlations . from a practical point of view",
    "if the fluctuations driven by uncorrelated stimuli can be decomposed from the intrinsic fluctuations generated by dynamical system , then these two classes of fluctuations may be shown to have different correlation properties . in the last one decade",
    "dfa has emerged as an important technique to study scaling and long range temporal correlation in a nonstationary time series @xcite which has been extensively studied in literature .",
    "it has been successfully applied to the diverse areas of research such as dna @xcite , neuron spiking @xcite , heart rate dynamics @xcite , economical time series , long time weather report @xcite .",
    "dfa is based on the idea that that if the time series contains nonstationarities then the variance of the fluctuations can be studied by successively detrending using linear quadratic , cubic higher order polynomial in a piecewise manner .",
    "most real time series exhibit persistence i.e subsequent element of the time series are correlated @xcite .",
    "the study of the self similarity and scaling in physics , socio economic sciences in the last several years has brought in new insights and new ideas for modeling them .",
    "for instance one of the important empirical results of the market dynamics is that the probablity distribution of price returns r in a typical market displays a power law @xcite i.e @xmath0 where @xmath1 =3 .",
    "similar power laws appear for the cumulative frequency distribution of earthquake magnitudes @xcite .",
    "while the spectral analysis ( fourier method ) , wavelet transform modulas maxima ( wtmm ) analyze the time series directly the dfa is based on the random walk theory , similar to the hurst rescale range analysis .",
    "presence of strong trends associated with nonstationarity can lead to the false detection of scaling exponent .",
    "so for the reliable detection of power law exponent ( @xmath1 ) it is essential to distinguish trends @xcite from the long range fluctuation @xcite intrinsic in the data .",
    "most economic and financial time @xciteseries are persistent with @xmath20.5 .",
    "changes in the dynamics during the measurement period usually constitute an undesired complication of the analysis . in many applications of linear ( frequency based ) time series analysis @xcite , stationarity has to be valid only up to the second moments ( `` weak stationarity '' ) .",
    "then the obvious approach is to test for changes in second or higher order quantities , like the mean , the variance , skewness , kurtosis .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss the matters pertaining to the study of the scaling exponent by applying different forcing amplitude along with the reliable detection of the change in the value of scaling exponent in different scaling region characterised as crossover phenomena .",
    "recurrence plot ( rp ) and recurrence quantification analysis @xcite is a relatively new and advanced technique which helps to identify different dynamical properties of a system under consideration .",
    "they have been extensively used in diverse fields such as earth science , plasma , earth science , economy to gain understanding about the nonlinear dynamics of complex system .",
    "it has also been utilized as an emerging tool to analyze simulation data of ion temperature gradient turbulence @xcite and dissipative trapped electron mode turbulence @xcite and to characterize transport dynamics .",
    "the knowledge of transition between chaotic , laminar or regular behaviour is essential to understand underlying mechanism behind a complex system @xcite . while linear approaches are not appropriate , there are several nonlinear methods that can suitably account for the transition .",
    "the traditional recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) that does not require long time observation is one such appropriate nonlinear method .",
    "we can also graphically detect different patterns and structural changes in time series data using recurrence plot ( rp s ) which exhibit characteristic large and small scale patterns caused by the typical dynamical behaviour @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present a brief schematic of the experimental setup , followed by the results of the analysis of floating potential fluctuation , recurrence plot , recurrence quantification analysis in section iii .",
    "section iv represent a comprehensive analysis of nonstationarity with detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) .",
    "the results of the analysis for dfa method to estimate the scaling exponent for different forcing amplitude along with the exploration of crossover phenomena have been carried out in section v. conclusions are presented in section vi .",
    "the experiments were carried out in a cylindrical hollow cathode dc glow discharge argon plasma with a typical density and temperature of @xmath3 and 2 - 6 ev respectively .",
    "the chamber was evacuated by rotary pump to attain a base pressure of @xmath4 mbar .",
    "experiments were performed under different forcing amplitudes like sinusoidal , square , noise for two operating neutral pressure i.e 0.12 mbar , 0.004 mbar respectively with discharge voltage ( dv ) being fixed at 435volt . an unbiased langmuir probe was used to obtain the floating potential fluctuations acquired with a sampling time of @xmath5 sec .",
    "a signal generator was also coupled with the dv through a capacitor for observing fluctuations in presence of forcing as shown in the schematic diagram of fig .",
    "the sequential change in floating potential fluctuations ( fpf s ) acquired by applying noise , sinusoidal , and square forcing is presented in fig .",
    "[ rr ] . the dynamical change in the fpf s has been detected with recurrence plots and its quantification measure namely recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) and discussed in detail with the help of these .",
    "we have utilized rp s and rqa s as an important tools for identifying the dynamical transition for different forcing amplitudes . the recurrence plot ( rp )",
    "@xcite is a relatively new technique of time series signals to understand the hidden insights involving the intricacies of the interplay between nature of different periodicity of the system .",

    "according to taken s embedding theorem using a time series data @xmath6 an embedding can be made using the vector @xmath11 which represent the original time series embedded into d dimensional phase space with @xmath12 being the delay .",
    "rp s are graphical , two dimensional representations showing the instants of time at which a phase space trajectory returns approximately to the same regions of phase space .",
    "a recurrence is said to occur whenever a trajectory visits approximately the same region of phase space indicating @xmath13 , whereas if the state does nt recur with itself we are left with @xmath14 .",

    "the most striking feature of our observation is how crossovers in the correlation behavior can be detected reliably and determined quantitatively .",

    "it is the advantage of dfa that it can systematically remove trends embedded in a nonstationary time series and in this way we can gain insight into the scaling behaviour .",
