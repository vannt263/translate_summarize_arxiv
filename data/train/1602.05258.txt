    "before discussing the results of our analysis derived in section  5 for the program stars , we first review how the strength of o  i 77715 triplet and its non - lte effect behaves in terms of the atmospheric parameters .",

    "while the line strength slightly grows with a lowering of @xmath11 at @xmath7  k ( because of the increased non - lte effect ; note that this tendency is seen only in @xmath54 but not in @xmath55 ) , the trend is reversed at @xmath9  k where @xmath63 markedly weakens with a decrease in @xmath11 because the effect of enhanced ionization becomes more important at the condition of lower - density .",
    "+  the non - lte effect always acts in the direction of intensifying the line strength ( @xmath91 ) , which makes the non - lte abundance correction ( @xmath64 ) always negative . +",
    " the extent of @xmath92 has a peak at @xmath0  1500020000  k and tends to be larger for higher [ o / h ] , smaller @xmath25 , and lower @xmath11 , which can be interpreted that the non - lte effect becomes more significant when the line - forming depth is higher or in the lower density region .",
    "we now discuss figure  6 .",
    "the equivalent widths ( @xmath63 ) derived in subsection  5.2 show a decreasing trend with an increase in @xmath10 ( figure  6a ) , which is reasonably consistent with the theoretically predicted trend for @xmath54 ( cf .",
    "figure  3a  c ) .",
    "the @xmath92 values are in the range of @xmath12  0.61.7  dex ( figure  6b ) , which are so large that these corrections are indispensable for reliable determination of oxygen abundances of b - type stars based on the o  i  77715 lines . comparing these results with those of hempel and holweger ( 2003 ) , who determined the non - lte oxygen abundances of b5b9 stars",
    "( @xmath0  900017000  k ) based on the same o  i triplet , we see that their @xmath92 values ( @xmath12  0.31.2 ; cf .",

    "we suspect that they underestimated the importance of the non - lte effect , which may explain the significantly supersolar [ o / h]@xmath93 results ( by @xmath12  + 0.30.6  dex ) they obtained for many of their sample stars .",
    "figure  6c suggests that the oxygen abundances derived for the 34 b - type stars distribute around @xmath12  8.78.8 without any systematic @xmath10-dependence .",

    "if three stars with @xmath58(o )  @xmath96 ( hr  6779 , 7236 , 8238 ) showing appreciable deviations are excluded , we have @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this means that the surface oxygen abundances of these b - type stars are mostly near to the solar composition ( see footnote  5 ) , which is in fairly good agreement with the previous studies for b - type stars ; e.g. , @xmath99 derived in paper  i based on o  i 61568 lines or @xmath100 by lyubimkov et al .",

    "al.s ( 2013 ) calculation , while no change in the surface composition is produced at all during the main sequence period for the case of non - rotating stars , rapidly rotating stars may show some abundance peculiarities caused by the rotational mixing of nuclear processed product . for example , regarding the cases of solar - metallicity ( @xmath106 ) models , the changes of he@xmath107o abundances at the end of the main sequence for 4  @xmath108 star is @xmath109 ( @xmath110 = 0.5 ) and @xmath111 ( @xmath110 = 0.95 ) , while those for 9  @xmath108 star is @xmath112 ( @xmath110 = 0.5 ) and @xmath113 ( @xmath110 = 0.95 ) , where @xmath114 is the angular rotational velocity corresponding to the critical break - up .",

    ", we may state that our result is more or less consistent with the recent stellar evolution calculations based on the canonical mixing theory .      finally , we turn to the question which motivated this investigation ( cf .",
    "section  1 ) : is the o  i 77715 triplet practically useful for oxygen abundance determination of b - type stars ?",
    "our answer is as follows : +  yes , it is surely useful as far as stars of @xmath7  k are concerned ( given that the non - lte effect is properly taken into account ) , since its strength is still sufficiently large ( @xmath116  m@xmath3 ) and abundances are not seriously affected by uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters .",
    "+  for example , if we consider a case of @xmath117  km  s@xmath2 and @xmath118  m@xmath3 , the fwhm and the central depth of the merged triplet feature would be @xmath119  @xmath3 and @xmath120% , respectively , which is measurable without difficulty on a spectrum with s / n ratios of a few hundred .",
    "+  in contrast , regarding very early b stars of @xmath9  k ( corresponding to @xmath12  b0 ) , the strength of this triplet quickly drops away and its sensitivity to ambiguities of @xmath10 or @xmath11 becomes seriously large , which makes it unsuitable as a reliable abundance indicator .",
    "+  we should keep in mind , however , even for the well - behaved case of @xmath7  k stars , the precision of abundance derivation would be on the order of @xmath6  dex , which is mainly restricted by uncertainties in the choice of microturbulence .",
    "accordingly , very high - precision should not be expected .",
    "+  in this sense , detection of surface oxygen abundance anomaly based on these o  i lines would be feasible only if the extent of peculiarity is sufficiently large ( e.g. , by @xmath121  dex ) , such as the case where non - canonical deep mixing is relevant . the slight abundance change ( up to @xmath115  dex ) predicted by the current canonical rotational mixing theory",
    "can hardly be detected .",
    "in order to examine whether the o  i triplet lines at 77715  @xmath3 can be used as a reliable oxygen abundance indicator for b - type stars of high @xmath10 including rapid rotators , we carried out oxygen abundance determinations for selected 34 b - type stars based on the spectra ( @xmath72 ) obtained by the 2  m nayuta telescope at nishi - harima astronomical observatory .",
    "regarding the atmospheric parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 were determined from @xmath36 colors and the microturbulence was assumed to be @xmath103  km  s@xmath2 ( @xmath48  k ) and @xmath104  km  s@xmath2 ( @xmath49  k ) by consulting previous studies .",
    "the non - lte effect was properly taken into consideration based on our non - lte calculations carried out for an extensive grid of models .",
    "we first determined the provisional abundance and @xmath26 by applying the synthetic spectrum - fitting analysis to the 77715 feature , and then inversely determined ( from the tentative abundance ) the equivalent width of the whole triplet to be used for further evaluations of non - lte / lte abundances , non - lte correction , and errors due to ambiguities of atmospheric parameters .",
    "it was found that the extent of the ( negative ) non - lte correction is appreciably large to be @xmath122  0.61.7  dex and its consideration is indispensable .",
    "the resulting non - lte oxygen abundances turned out to be nearly solar ( @xmath123  8.78.8 with @xmath124  dex ) without any clear dependence upon rotation as well as luminosity ( or mass ) , which is consistent with the results of published observational studies and stellar evolution calculations with the canonical mixing theory .",
    "we concluded that this triplet is a useful o abundance indicator ( with a precision of @xmath6  dex ) up to @xmath7  k , since its total equivalent width is sufficiently large ( @xmath8  m@xmath3 ) .",
    "in contrast , it is not adequate for abundance determination for stars at @xmath9  k , where its strength rapidly turns down and its sensitivity to @xmath10 or @xmath11 becomes considerably large .",
