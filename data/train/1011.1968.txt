    "recently , the isolation of single - layer graphene@xcite has revived much interest in studying two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac fermions .",
    "one of the peculiar properties associated with 2d dirac fermions is the unusual electronic properties in the presence of defects and disorders . in the context of cuprate superconductors , where quasi - particles are also 2d dirac fermions ,",
    "disorders have masked the d - wave nature and hindered its discovery .",
    "it was later realized that point defects may change the density of states ( dos ) near the dirac point and strong point defects may even induce quasi - localized states or magnetic moments near zero energy in d - wave superconductors@xcite . in the case of graphene , it is found that there is finite density of states due to weak disorders@xcite . for strong disorders ,",
    "it was observed that ferromagnetic state can be induced by bombarding a graphite with protons@xcite .",
    "the induced magnetism is further confirmed to be resulted from @xmath0-electrons@xcite .",
    "this fact , together with recent observation of ferromagnetism in disordered graphene@xcite , shows that graphene with defects could become ferromagnetic .",
    "in addition to magnetism , graphene also reveals anomalous transport properties in the presence of strong disorders , where in the presence of vacancies , instead of decreasing , the conductivity is found to increase@xcite .",
    "these observations clearly indicates that in the presence of strong disorders , 2d dirac fermions may behave very differently from what is expected for clean or weak disordered graphene .",
    "experimentally , there are many possible forms of disorders in graphene@xcite . for large defects such as cracks",
    ", they tend to contain the so - called zig - zag edges , where localized states would appear near the edge@xcite and induce magnetic behavior@xcite . in this case ,",
    "magnetic moments arise from localized states and interact via rkky ( ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ) interaction , which tends to make graphene antiferromagnetic@xcite .",
    "hence the most possible candidates for the observed ferromagnetism in graphene are defects of small sizes or simply point defects . here",
    "the simplest point defects are single - atom vacancies or hydrogen chemisorption defects .",
    "these kinds of defects generally create complicated disturbances in graphene and may even form ordered structures@xcite .",
    "however , for low density of quenched defects , they can be simulated by a large potential @xmath1 on a lattice point without distortion of nearby lattice points@xcite .",
    "theoretically , extensive studies on a single defect have been performed on d - wave superconductors@xcite .",
    "it is known that a zero - energy electronic state would arise near a point defect with @xmath2 or a circular disk in a 2d dirac hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the electronic wavefunction is semi - localized with amplitude decaying as @xmath3 at large distance @xmath4@xcite . the semi - localized behavior is clearly revealed in the observed stm images of long - range @xmath5 superstructure in graphene@xcite . for finite density of defects ,",
    "one expects that semi - localized electrons interact strongly and may form an impurity band@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , conflicting results based on either perturbative or non - perturbative approaches are reported@xcite .",
    "the residual dos near zero energy is predicted to be either finite@xcite , infinite@xcite , or vanishing with different power laws in energy@xcite .",
    "this issue remains unsolved .    while quasi - particles in both cuprate superconductors and graphenes are 2d dirac fermions , the situation is quite different for graphene .",
    "for neutral graphene , even though excitonic effects are expected to be large@xcite , for low energies and large distances , the screened coulomb interaction is shown be long - ranged@xcite with renormalized dielectric constant . furthermore",
    ", the electron itself is the quasi - particle and carries a definite charge .",
    "these differences make graphene behave totally different from that of cuprate superconductors in the strong disorders . in particular , without being masked by superconductivity , direct manifestation of the impurity band is possible in graphene",
    ". therefore , investigation on graphene with strong defects would provide an unique opportunity to clarify the issue of dos near zero energy for 2d dirac fermions with strong disorders .",
    "this is recently pointed out in ref .",
    "[ ] . in that paper , the wavefunction for finite density of defects is constructed . by using the wavefunction for two defects",
    ", it is shown that ferromagnetic state is favored for large distances between two defects .",
    "however , for finite density of defects , the problem of finding dos is mapped to an equivalent problem of finding the dos of a random matrix .",
    "one has to assume that the matrix elements are independent random numbers to demonstrate the induced ferromagnetism@xcite .",
    "while the predicted dos ( wigner semi - circle law ) appears to be consistent with results obtained by self - consistent born approximation@xcite , to confirm that the observed ferromagnetism and anomalous transport properties of graphene are consequences of the impurity band , one needs to go beyond self - consistent born approximation and to resolve the issue of how the dos of 2d dirac fermions changes in strong disorder limit .    in this paper",
    ", we re - examine the density of states of a graphene due to strong point defects .",
    "in particular , we show that the inverse t - matrix for @xmath6 point defects can be exactly mapped to a @xmath7 symmetric euclidean random matrix in which one can not treat the matrix elements as independent random numbers .",
    "instead of focusing on the dos directly , we analyze magnitudes distribution for eigenfunctions for the derived random matrix . remarkably , we find that squared magnitudes of eigenfunctions show random - walk behaviors on defect positions . as a result",
    ", the distribution of squared magnitudes of eigenfunctions for the euclidean random matrix follows the porter - thomas distribution .",
    "further analysis shows that eigenvalues ( @xmath8 ) of the corresponding euclidean random matrix also follow the thomas - porter distribution@xcite and the dos near zero energy for infinite @xmath1 is @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the density of defects and @xmath11 is the average of @xmath12 over defect configurations .",
    "@xmath13 is given by @xmath14 and we found that @xmath15 shows random - walk behavior .",
    "the resulting density of states has strong effects on magnetic and transport properties of graphene .",
    "we re - examine the effect of the long - range coulomb interaction with renormalized dielectric constant and show that the resulted dos supports ferromagnetism for any finite density of defects . at finite temperature ,",
    "the linear extrapolation of magnetization curve indicates that @xmath16 , in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we lay down the theoretical formulation and show that the inverse t - matrix for @xmath6 point defects can be exactly mapped to a @xmath17 euclidean random matrix . in sec .",
    "iii , we use both analytic arguments and numerical simulations to derive the density of resonant states . in sec .",
    "iv , we reexamine effects of the screened long - range coulomb interaction . we show that the competition between the exchange energy and kinetic resonant energy leads to ferromagnetism for infinite on - site potentials .",
    "the magnetizations both at zero and finite temperatures are also calculated . in sec .",
    "v , we conclude and discuss possible effects for weak impurities . appendix a is devoted to more rigorous derivation of the porter - thomas distribution in the saddle - point limit .",
    "we start by setting up the framework for investigating the effects of defect .",
    "it is known that electrons in the @xmath0 band of an infinite graphene can be well described by a tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath18@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ graphene ] , the lattice of graphene is bi - partite .",
    "if we label the bi - partite lattice points by a and b , @xmath18 consists of hopping only for nearest a and b with a hopping amplitude @xmath19 .",
    "hence if defects are located at @xmath20 with @xmath21 , the wavefunction @xmath22 for an electron then satisfies @xmath23 here and in the following , both @xmath24 and @xmath20 are restricted to points on the honeycomb lattice shown in fig . 1 .",

    "( [ sumperturb ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "one sets @xmath24 to @xmath20 with @xmath46 in eq .",

    "are also related by the kramers - kronig relation @xmath60 it is thus clear that the resonant energies of the green s function @xmath41 are determined by zeros of eigenvalues of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , resonant energies due to defects are determined by @xmath62 note that the above condition is exactly the same as the one obtained via the constructed wavefunction for defects@xcite and should be compared to the similar equation obtained in the context of d - wave superconductors@xcite . since a graphene without defect is translationally invariant , one has @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , diagonal terms in eq.([eigen ] ) are identical and are equal to @xmath64 . hence if the positions of defects are random , solving eq.([eigen ] ) is equivalent to finding eigenvalues of the random matrix @xmath65 furthermore , if one defines the density of eigenvalues for @xmath66 by @xmath67 with @xmath68 being the total number of lattice points and @xmath69 being the @xmath70-th eigenvalue , the density of resonant states is given by @xmath71 therefore , it is sufficient to find the distribution of eigenvalues for @xmath66 .",
    "we note in passing that if values of @xmath72 form a band after averaging over defect configurations , it implies that the averaged @xmath73 is independent of @xmath50 .",

    "in the last section , it is shown that the density of resonant states is determined by the spectrum of @xmath66 . since each element , @xmath53 , depends on positions of defects , they fluctuate randomly . in the simplest approximation ,",
    "one treats each element as an independent random number .",
    "the density of states is characterized by the wigner semi - circle law@xcite .",
    "as indicated earlier , this approximation appears to be equivalent to the self - consistent born approximation @xcite .",
    "a closer examination of @xmath66 shows that the dependence of each matrix element on the position @xmath20 makes them correlated .",
    "hence one can not treat each element as an independent random number .",
    "indeed , it was realized in different context by mezard et al.@xcite that such random matrices form distinct classes known as euclidean random matrices , whose spectrum depends on the functional form of the matrix element on @xmath20 .",
    "it is generally difficult to find the exact spectrum for any given euclidean random matrices . for defects on graphene",
    ", however , it turns out that the spectrum of @xmath66 follows a simple form known as the porter - thomas distribution@xcite . in this section",
    ", we shall focus on the study of the spectrum by numerical simulation .",
    "an analytical derivation based on saddle - point approximation will be relayed to the appendix .",
    "we start by noting that since one expects that the energies of resonant states are close to zero , as a first step , we can approximate each matrix element by @xmath77 .",
    "we shall see later that the error due to this approximation is small for @xmath78 . in this approximation , by using eqs.([gaa ] ) and ( [ gba ] ) , one finds @xmath79 and @xmath80 . hence @xmath66 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "furthermore , since in the second quantization form , @xmath81 , we find that @xmath66 goes to @xmath82 under the particle - hole transformation : @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum is particle - hole symmetric , i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "in addition of being particle - hole symmetric , @xmath66 itself also supports energy states exactly at zero energy due to the unbalance in the number of lattice points in a and b@xcite . since the number of zero energy states is equal to @xmath86 , if lattice points are randomly assigned to a or b , one finds @xmath87 and hence their contribution is negligible in the limit of @xmath88 with @xmath89 being fixed at the defect density @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , in the following , we shall focus on density of resonant states for the case with @xmath90 to avoid complications due to extra zero energy states .    for high density of defects",

    "as illustrated in fig.[states ] , for weak disorders , @xmath1 is small , the impurity band is shifted into the dirac band . in this case , while the majority weight of the impurity band disappears , its tail still sweeps through zero energy and contributes small but finite dos . as indicated above , these density of states generally enhances the transport .",
    "this explains why when graphene is made cleaner , the conductivity , instead of increasing , decreases and appears to approach an universal constant@xcite . while the impurity band can not account for the exact value of the universal conductivity , our results serve as a useful starting point for obtaining corrections to the conductivity .",

    "this work was supported by the national science council of taiwan .",
    "in this appendix , we shall show that the eigenvalue distribution for @xmath66 follows the porter - thomas distribution in the limit of @xmath225 but with the defect density @xmath10 being fixed .",
    "we start by noting that the spectrum of @xmath66 can be found by calculating the resolvent @xmath226 where @xmath68 is the total number of lattice points and @xmath227 is the average over the random configurations of defects .",
    "clearly , we have @xmath228 .",
    "as shown in the text , since the spectrum has particle - hole symmetry , we shall set @xmath8 to @xmath12 and consider only positive @xmath8 .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath229 can be reformulated by a replica field theory@xcite via the following identity @xmath230 the term @xmath231 can be re - expressed by @xmath70 replica complex fields @xmath232 ( @xmath233=1,2,3, .. ,@xmath70 ) as follows @xmath234 up to now @xmath232 is only defined on defect sites . to remove this constraint ,",
    "one introduces the field @xmath235 defined on every lattice site and impose @xmath236 $ ] .",
    "the constraint of the delta function can be removed by using the identity @xmath237 . here",
    "@xmath238 is the replica field . after integrating out @xmath239 and @xmath235",
    ", the resolvent can be expressed as@xcite @xmath240 where the partition function @xmath241 is given by @xmath242 with @xmath243 being given by @xmath244 here @xmath245 .",
    "note that because @xmath246 , we have that for @xmath78 , @xmath247 .",
    "in other words , @xmath248 has the same form as the tight - binding hamiltonian for graphene except that it only acts on defect sites .",
    "it is clear that in eq.([r1 ] ) , the replica symmetry is broken .",
    "one needs to perform integrations for @xmath251 and @xmath238 with @xmath252 separately . for @xmath251 ,",
    "the integrand can be rewritten as @xmath253 with @xmath254 given by latexmath:[\\[s^i_1= \\frac{|\\psi_1 ( \\vec{r}_i ) |^2}{z } - \\ln |\\psi_1 ( \\vec{r}_i )    energy near zero , in the saddle - point approximation , integration over @xmath251 is dominated by the maximum of @xmath254 , which is determined by @xmath256 for all @xmath20 .",
    "we find that maximum of @xmath254 satisfies @xmath257 it is clear that for low density , we can expand @xmath258 in term of @xmath10 .",
    "we find @xmath259 .",
    "because @xmath260 is finite , we obtain @xmath261 for all @xmath20 . as a result , the integration of @xmath251 in eq.([r1 ] )",
    "can be approximated as @xmath262 here @xmath263 is a constant that results from @xmath260 and @xmath264 is the 2nd derivative of @xmath254 with respect to @xmath258 and is proportional to @xmath265 .",
    "@xmath266 is the integration over @xmath267 with @xmath268 and is given by @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the average with respect to @xmath271 and @xmath272 with @xmath271 being given by @xmath273 it is clear that different @xmath233 and @xmath186 are equivalent .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath274 combing eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a ] ) gives the limiting behavior of the numerator for small @xmath275 . to obtain the spectrum for small @xmath8",
    ", one needs to find the analytical continuation by replacing @xmath275 by @xmath276 .",
    "clearly , the factor @xmath277 only contributes the real part .",
    "together with the fact that the denominator is @xmath278 , which goes to one when @xmath70 approaches zero , we find that @xmath279 both @xmath280 and @xmath281 can be calculated perturbatively with finite results in the limit @xmath282@xcite .",
    "after appropriate normalization , one finds the spectrum of @xmath8 follows the form @xmath283ning , p. schwaller , l. schlapbach , and p. gr@xmath284ning , phy .",
