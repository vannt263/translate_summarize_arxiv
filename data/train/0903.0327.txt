    "the effective molecular concentration is @xmath16 given an average molecular weight @xmath17kda ( i.e. , @xmath18 amino acids ) .",
    "that is , @xmath19 .",
    "all molecules diffuse randomly in the large box .",
    "once the distance between two monomers reaches a smaller value , @xmath0 , i.e. , the monomers diffuse into a small confined space ( fig.1_a _ ) , there they can form a dimer by folding and binding .",
    "the diffusion time is simulated using a brownian dynamics ( see the methods ) , and a monotonic decrease of the time versus the size @xmath0 is obtained ( fig.1_b _ ) .    in the brownian dynamics",
    "each monomer is modeled as a single particle mimicking the protein chains .",
    "clearly , the diffusion of such particle could not fully describe the case of the protein chains since the protein chains are soft and may change their conformations during the diffusion .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , an effective friction for the particles could be used to model the diffusion of the protein chains .",
    "previously , a friction coefficient @xmath20 was used for a single amino acid with size @xmath21 @xcite . for the subunit of arc repressor ( with 53 amino acids ) studied in this work , a corresponding friction coefficient is estimated to be @xmath22 since the size of the arc monomer is approximately @xmath23 . here , a spherical conformation for the monomer is assumed .",
    "note that for a protein with @xmath24 amino acids a friction coefficient is @xmath25 [ if a friction coefficient @xmath26 , which was argued to be a factor of 10 larger than the measured value for amino acids in water@xcite , is set , one has @xmath27 .",
    "thus a value of @xmath28 is in the reasonable range to model the kinetics for protein arc . to show the effect of friction coefficient on diffusion rate of the monomers , several cases with different @xmath29 values are simulated",
    "( see fig.1_b _ ) .",
    "clearly , the diffusion slows down when the friction is large .",
    "it is noted that such simplified diffusion of brownian particles is approximate but reasonable when the sizes of the conformations of the two protein chains can be negligible when compared with the inter - chain distance between them . obviously , if the density of the specific monomers is high , the diffusion time will be short and the dimerization events will be more frequent . in the present work we only put two such monomers to model the least case .",
    "it is also worth noting that if the size of confined space @xmath0 is roughly @xmath30 times the radius of gyration @xmath31 of the monomers , the monomers need to diffuse further within the confined space . here",
    "a value @xmath30 is set since unfolded monomeric chain is extended @xcite .    .",

    "clearly , arc is taken as the model protein because it is small and has been studied experimentally . in a crowded circumstance ,",
    "the confined space is taken as a cylindrical cavity ( fig.1_c _ ) and its diameter @xmath34 and height @xmath35 are set equal to each other .",
    "the size of the cylinder is related to the effective molecular concentration by @xmath36 if every cylinder only contains two molecules .",
    "obviously , a big cylinder or weak confinement corresponds to a low @xmath10 and _ vice versa _",

    "thus , two arc monomers may fold and bind in such a cavity , modelling the dimerization of a homodimer within a crowded cell .",
    "such behaviors are simulated based on the molecular dynamics using the go - like potentials ( see the methods ) .",
    "the confinement is modeled by a cylinder which was previously used to study the confinement / crowding effect on protein folding @xcite .",
    "simulations using spherical space provide that using different confinement shapes will not qualitatively change the results @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a study on the molecular crowding effect on folding of globular proteins suggested that to depict a rather crowded _ in vivo _",
    "environment , the optimal cavity to host protein molecule may be cylindrical @xcite .",
    "some features of the dimerization trajectories of the arc dimer confined in a cavity with @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 m ) at the related transition temperature @xmath39 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the typical time evolution of the native contacts of chain - a and chain - b ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) and the interfacial native contacts ( @xmath42 ) and the separating distance @xmath43 between the centers of mass of two chains is shown ( fig.2_a - b _ ) .",
    "one can see clearly that the folded state ( with @xmath40 or @xmath44 ) emerges only when the interface is formed ( with @xmath45 ) .",
    "interestingly , @xmath43 varies between the folded and unfolded states .",
    "the free energies of the folding and binding process projected onto three different sets of reaction coordinates show the most populated states , i.e. , folded chains with a well formed interface ( both @xmath40 and @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ) and the unfolded chains without binding ( both @xmath40 and @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ) ( fig.2_c - d _ ) .",
    "note that the interfacial native contacts @xmath50 are almost twice as numerous as the intra - chain native contacts @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) @xmath53 , thus energetically , the states with @xmath40 and @xmath48 can still be referred as the unfolded states .",
    "these indicate that the folding and binding occur in a cooperative two - state manner , consistent with previous _ in vitro _",

    "curve - c shows the case for two tethered monomers .",
    "the related concentrations are listed in the upper x - axes in both fig.3_a - b_. ]      to study the influence of the various effective molecular concentrations @xmath10 on the dimerization , the transition temperatures @xmath39 , which characterizes the thermodynamic stability of the dimer ( high value of @xmath39 means high stability ) are obtained . in fig.3_a",
    "_ , it is shown that the value of @xmath39 decreases monotonically as @xmath0 increases ( or @xmath10 decreases ) , implying that small @xmath10 or large space results in low value of @xmath39 or low thermodynamic stability .",
    "experimentally , both urea and thermal denaturation showed that the stability of the arc dimer is low at low protein concentrations @xcite .",
    "experiments on other dimeric proteins have also showed that high concentration improves the thermodynamic stability @xcite .",
    "our results are clearly consistent with these experimental observations .",
    "the value of @xmath39 at @xmath57 m ( or @xmath58 ) increases about @xmath59 with respect to that of the case of confinement - free , i.e. , @xmath60 defined roughly at @xmath61 m .",
    "obviously , such a big enhancement in the thermodynamic stability is due to the crowding effect or confinement which reduces the conformational and translational entropies of the unfolded states of the two monomers more than it affects the native dimer thus making the unfolded states unstable ( see an argument in the final part ) .",
    "note that the dimerization can not occur if the confined space @xmath62 ( see fig.3_a _ ) .",
    "this relates to a too crowding case for the monomers to perform their folding and binding .",
    "the effect of concentration on the kinetics of dimerization is also reflected in the rate of dimerization by incorporating the diffusion , folding and binding processes together ( fig.3_b _ ) .",
    "the rate @xmath63 changes nonmonotonically as @xmath0 increases ( or @xmath10 decreases ) , showing an optimal maximum at @xmath64 m which is relevant to the macromolecular concentration in cells ( see curve - a and curve - b in fig.3_b _ ) . here the rate @xmath63 is in inverse proportion to the summation of the time for the two monomers to diffuse into the confined space and time for assembly of two monomers within the confined space . note that the assembly of two monomers within a confined space may include the local diffusion if the initial distance between the two monomers is large .",
    "clearly , here the diffusion of two monomers in the cavity is simulated by the motion of two poloymeric chains ( fig.1_c _ ) not of two point particles ( fig.1_a _ ) .    in fig.3_b",
    "_ , three cases , namely those for the dimerization of two monomers with and without diffusion and for the single tethered mutant , are shown .",
    "curve - a shows the case without nonlocal diffusion , which describes a situation of high local concentration of the monomers .",
    "it is found that when @xmath0 is small ( or @xmath10 is high ) , the dimerization is slow and quite difficult since the conformational space for the chains to search is limited .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , the dimerization becomes easier and faster .",
    "however , when @xmath0 is too large , the conformational space becomes very big and the chains now must spend much time in finding the folded state , resulting in slow dimerization .",
    "thus , there exists an optimal size for the confinement , or an optimal effective concentration @xmath65 . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the rate @xmath63 monotonically decreases as @xmath10 decreases ( fig.3_b _ ) .",
    "when @xmath10 is low enough , the rate @xmath63 depends linearly on @xmath10 in agreement with the experimental observation@xcite . as shown by curve - b ,",
    "a similar change of dimerization rate is also observed when the nonlocal diffusion is taken into account .",
    "since the diffusion time decreases monotonically as the size of confined space @xmath0 increases ( fig.1_b _ ) , the decrease of dimerization rate becomes slower .",
    "however , there still exists an optimal size of the confinement , or an optimal effective concentration having about the same value of @xmath65 obtained for the case without the nonlocal diffusion .",
    "the physical origin for such a behavior is basically the same as the case without diffusion , and the nonlocal diffusion only increases the total time of the dimerization when two monomers are further separated .",
    "actually , curve - b is related to rather rigorous environment since the local concentration of the monomers is low ( only two monomers among 1000 molecules are assumed ) and the averaged separation distance is large . clearly , if the local concentration of the monomers is not so low or the monomers are co - located , the effects of global diffusion are smaller . as a result , a curve of dimerization rate should be bounded by the curves - a and -b .",
    "clearly , for the tethered mutant , i.e. , when the two chains of the arc dimer are linked together , the thermodynamic stability is higher than for the non - tethered case , especially when @xmath66 ( see fig.3_a _ ) , and the rate of dimerization shows a plateau when @xmath3 ( fig.3_b _ ) .",
    "again this agrees with experimental observations that tethering two subunits of a dimeric protein significantly enhances both the thermal stability of the dimer and the rate of dimerization @xcite .",
    "the physical reason is that the tethering reduces significantly the conformational and translational entropies of the two tethered chains , resulting in the reduction of the search time in the unfolded ensemble and destabilization of the unfolded states .",
    "in addition , the two chains of arc dimer would not need to diffuse much to be close to each other because they are already linked together .",
    "therefore , it takes them less time to complete the folding and binding in comparison to the non - tethered case especially for large confined spaces .",
    "obviously , more time is needed for diffusion as the available space of two monomers grows larger .",
    "it is worth noting that the tethered case actually is related to a rather crowded case of non - tethered monomers , and gives an effective concentration @xmath67 m for the non - tethered arc dimers here@xcite .",
    "this is relevant to the optimized effective concentration @xmath14 m .      to characterize the folding and binding of the two chains , we calculate the free energy profiles for both processes , respectively . as shown in fig.4_a _",
    ", for a case of @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 m ) , the height of free energy barrier @xmath68 for binding is about @xmath69 which is much larger than that for folding of the monomeric chains , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "this suggests that the binding is a dominant rate - limiting step in the dimerization .",
    "interestingly , it is found that the value of @xmath68 increases when @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 m ) and then is saturated to @xmath73 when @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 m ) ( fig.4_b _ ) . however , the variation of @xmath76 for the monomeric chain is rather small ( fig.4_c _ )",
    ". therefore , the crowding effect mainly influences the binding rather than the folding of the monomers . the rate limiting step , the binding of two monomers , also requires overcoming frustrated polar interactions or non - native contacts formed at the interface between two monomers in a relatively hydrophobic environment @xcite .    to further understand the dimerization of the two chains , the free energy profile as a function of @xmath77 , the distance between the centers of mass of two chains shifted by subtracting the native separation distance ,",
    "is shown in fig.4_d_. free energy funnels can be clearly seen for three cases . as an example for the case of @xmath78 , a deep well around @xmath79 corresponds to a quite stable binding or a localized state of the two chains .",
    "note that the effective attraction is short ranged , and is similar to that of the binding between the ligand and receptor .",
    "it is also seen that the two chains have weak or even no interaction in a certain range of @xmath80 . however , due to the repulsive interaction between the protein chains and the cavity wall representing the excluded volume effects of other protein , the free energy increases when @xmath81 .",
    "thus we see the dimerization is cooperatively guided by the binding and confinement quite naturally . for the various cavity sizes , the ranges with weak interactions and the values of @xmath82 are different , indicating that the slopes of the free energy profiles are different .",
    "the presence of a free energy funnel allows the dimerization to be stabilized by confinement .",
    "this is very similar to that of a free energy of protein - ligand binding obtained theoretically and also to the force measured for the ligand - receptor association and dissociation @xcite .",
    "the dimerization reaction under confinement conditions investigated in this study by the native topology - based model @xcite focuses on the effect of the confinement on the configurational and translational entropy@xcite .",
    "in the cell , confinement and crowding encapsulate the monomers closely and facilitate binding .",
    "it is possible that the cavity has another role besides restricting the available volume of protein motions and dynamics . for example",
    ", other effects can arise due to interactions of the protein with the walls of the cavity or due to intra- or inter - monomeric non - native interactions .",

    "the open circles show the data from fig.4_c _ , and the line shows the scaling @xmath89 . ]      it is well known that the folded state corresponds to a compact conformation , while the ensemble of unfolded states has a huge number of extended conformations .",
    "thus , confinement primarily affects the free energy of the unfolded states through the conformational entropy .",
    "this effect can be quantified based on the theory of polymers with excluded volume @xcite . from the scaling arguments",
    ", the conformational entropy cost reads @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the unfolded states , @xmath92 the conformational entropy , @xmath93 the number of residues ( or beads ) with size @xmath21 of the beads in a chain , and @xmath0 the size of the confined space .",
    "the exponent @xmath94 is more generally equal to @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the flory exponent .",
    "in addition , since at the folding transition temperature the free energy differences between the unfolded states and native state @xmath97 for both cases with and without confinement are zero , we have a relationship between the folding temperatures and the entropies as @xmath98 where the superscript @xmath0 and @xmath99 indicate cases with and without the confinement .",
    "thus , we have @xmath100= t^{l}_{f}(\\delta s_{n } - \\delta s_{u})$ ] . in general",
    ", we have both the conformational and translational parts for @xmath101 , i.e. , @xmath102 .    for the tethered case , two",
    "monomers actually become a `` long '' single chain , and their contributions of translational entropies to @xmath101 are cancelled in a first approximation . only their contributions to conformational entropies remain .",
    "thus we have @xmath103 .",
    "since the relative shift @xmath104 is quite a bit smaller than unity , we have @xmath105 . as plotted in fig.5_a _ for simulation data of fig.3_a",
    "_ , a well agreement can be seen . for the case of two free monomers ,",
    "the process of folding and binding , i.e. , a process @xmath106 , involves the loss of one chain or monomer , and the translational entropies correspondingly can not be cancelled .",
    "for the unfolded / unbound states with 2 chains , this contribution changes with the confined volume @xmath107 as @xmath108 , whereas it is only @xmath109 for the folded / bound state .",
    "thus , we have @xmath110 .",
    "the logarithmic term explains why in the @xmath111 versus @xmath0 plot ( fig.3_a _ ) , the curve for two monomers does not seem to converge towards a plateau while that for the tethered case , where only the algebraic term is present , the curve does saturate at large value of @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that the transition state between the unfolded and folded states is an ensemble with a non vanishing conformational entropy due to its smaller spatial extension than the ensemble of unfolded states .",
    "the transition state ensemble is less sensitive to confinement , so its conformational entropy is not affected very much by confinement .",
    "when the system is confined at a given temperature , say at @xmath112 , the relative positions of free energies of the folded and transition states are not affected , while the unfolded state is destabilized . as a result , one then needs to increase the temperature by an amount @xmath113 to reach the folding temperature .",
    "the transition state is stabilized by an amount proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the barrier for folding @xmath68 should decrease linearly with @xmath114 .",
    "such an expectation is consistent with our simulation data as shown in the main plot in fig.5_b _ where a linear behavior is observed .",
    "the inset which shows the difference between the bulk barrier and that at a given confinement is thus an indirect way to check the above linear relation between barrier for folding and folding temperature shift .",
    "a model of confinement effects on dimerization of a typical homodimeric protein was studied .",
    "it was found that both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the dimerization are affected significantly by the effective molecular concentration characterized by the size of cavity .",

    "<S> experiments where there is only one kind of molecule involved in general , the dimerization occurs easily when the concentration is large . _ in vivo _ dimerization of specific monomers is more complicated than _ in vitro _ because cells are rather crowded due to the presence of various macromolecules@xcite . when the local concentration of the monomers is low , the monomers take a long time to diffuse together , and the diffusion even may be kinetically blocked by other molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this makes dimerization more difficult . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , when the local concentration of the monomers is sufficiently high , dimerization occurs easily .    </S>",
    "<S> the concentration of total macromolecules in cytoplasm is estimated to be @xmath5 @xcite which is approximately @xmath6 m ( or @xmath7 m ) if the averaged molecular weight @xmath8da , i.e. , 500 amino acids ( or 5000 amino acids ) in average for a macromolecules , is assumed . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , crowding must lead to excluded volume effects @xcite which can be described using an effective concentration of the reacting molecules . crowding can preferentially destabilize the balance between reactants and products , and makes the association reactions highly favored . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that association constants under crowded conditions could be several orders of magnitude larger than those in dilute solutions@xcite . at the same time , crowding causes a decrease in the diffusion rate of molecules by a factor in the range of @xmath9 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the translational diffusion of molecules in the cell is a kinetic process which can be described using brownian dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dimerization , ultimately , involves the intimate contact between two specific monomers , a local dynamic process . </S>",
    "<S> previously , the simultaneous folding and binding of a number of homodimers has been theoretically studied using topology based models ( go - like ) by adding a covalent linkage between the two monomers of the dimer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such studies may be directly related to the _ in vitro _ situation . to study the _ in vivo _ dimerization of homodimeric proteins , both interactions between the monomers and those between the monomers and other macromolecules must be considered . including crowding effects in such studies </S>",
    "<S> may provide some useful insights into the formation of various protein complexes and protein - protein interactions , and thus enable one to understand intracellular protein networks , and to design protein complexes that could act as pharmacological inhibitors .    here , we study the dimerization of two monomers encapsulated in a cavity with size @xmath0 which mimics the crowding in cell by an effective molecular concentration @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we study both the thermodynamics and kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion of the monomers into the confined space is described by a brownian dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> dimerization depends on the size @xmath0 , or the effective concentration @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> there the model predicts a maximal rate of dimerization at an optimal confined space size @xmath11 ( with unit @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an optimal @xmath13 corresponds to an effective concentration @xmath14 m which is of the order of the macromolecular concentration in cells @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a possibility that the rate of dimerization and the concentration of various macromolecules in cells may have been optimized by evolution . </S>",
    "<S> based on the changes of the conformational and translation entropies due to the confinement , we show that there is a scaling behavior for the heights of free energy barriers for binding and the folding transition temperatures with the cavity sizes . </S>"
