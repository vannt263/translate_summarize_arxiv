    "the theory of persistent homology is a very recent and active branch of algebraic topology .",
    "although the theory has a wide range of applications varying from data analysis and shape recognition to network theory , we will focus on it s theoretical framework .",
    "given an increasing sequence of simplicial complexes , parameterized by the natural numbers , persistent homology detects topological features that are in the simplicial complexes for many values of the parameter , for a complete exposition we refer to @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "multipersistent homology is a generalization of persistent homology in which the sequence of simplicial complexes is indexed by vectors in @xmath3 , first introduced by carlsson and zomorodian in @xcite , @xcite . in short ,",
    "the problem of multipersistent homology is about calculating the simplicial homologies of the spaces and confronting them using the maps induced in homology by the inclusions . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", we want to study how homology evolves along the sequence of spaces , restricting to the case when the process is stationary .",
    "the study of multipersistent homology is carried in @xcite and @xcite through multigraded modules over the polynomial ring @xmath4 $ ] called multipersistent modules .    in this work",
    "we highlight how , in analogy to simplicial homology , multipersistent homology modules are the homologies of the chain complex of @xmath5chain modules .",
    "the module of @xmath5 chains can be composed as a direct sum of monomial ideals .",
    "this characterization , provides a presentation of multipersistent homology modules by generators and relations that reflects the topological and combinatorial nature of the problem . in a special case ,",
    "called one - critical in @xcite , the chain complex is a chain complex of free @xmath2modules .",
    "this free chain complex is isomorphic to a cellular resolution if it is acyclic . in most cases anyway the complex is not acyclic and multipersistent homology modules measure the defect of acyclicity .    using our presentation and tools from homological algebra",
    "we then build a free multigraded resolution for multipersistent homology modules . as a constructive theorem @xcite states",
    "that every multigraded @xmath6-module can be realized as a multipersistent homology module , this resolution applies to all multigraded @xmath6-modules .",
    "the second section of this article is dedicated to notation and background information .",
    "the central part of the article is the third section in which we give a presentation of multipersistent homology modules and build a standard free resolution for such modules , other resolutions for multigraded @xmath6-modules with combinatorial meaning can be found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "cellular resolutions of monomial ideals @xcite,@xcite,@xcite are used in two ways through the article : firstly they are used in the construction of our resolution of multipersitent homology modules ; secondly we show how , in the one critical case , multipersistent homology modules measure the defect of aciclicity of cellular chain complexes constructed for cellular resolutions .",
    "in this section we recall some notions from topology , homological and commutative algebra that will be used in the article .    throughout the article @xmath7 will denote an arbitrary field of characteristic @xmath8 and @xmath9 the category of @xmath7-vector spaces and linear maps . for a commutative finitely generated @xmath10algebra @xmath11 ,",
