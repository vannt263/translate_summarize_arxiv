    "the discovery that hgte quantum wells ( qws ) with an inverted band structure are 2-dimensional topological insulators has generated a great interest in this novel state of quantum matter@xcite .",
    "when the thickness @xmath0 of the hgte qw is increased beyond a critical value @xmath1 , a quantum phase transition turns a conventional insulator into its topologically non - trivial counterpart . in this so - called quantum spin hall ( qsh )",
    "phase@xcite , current - carrying states are confined at the edge of the sample , while the bulk is insulating .",
    "these edge states are protected against backscattering from non - magnetic impurities@xcite and their propagation direction is helical , i.e. that opposite spin states counter - propagate along a given edge of the sample . when the applied gate voltage places the fermi level inside the bulk gap , two - terminal transport experiments measure a quantized conductance of @xmath2 with @xmath3 the electron charge and @xmath4 the planck constant , independent of the sample width , which constitutes strong evidence for edge state conduction@xcite .",
    "more recent nonlocal transport measurements in the qsh regime unambiguously establish that transport occurs through topologically protected edge channels@xcite .",
    "while edge state conduction in the qsh regime is thus experimentally well established , there exists so far no direct experimental evidence that the transport in the helical edge states of 2d topological insulators is spin - polarized , which is a fundamental characteristic of this new state of matter .    in this work , we construct novel devices ( figs .  1 and 2a ) that enable us to study the spin polarization of the qsh edge states by purely electrical means .",
    "first of all , these devices allow us to detect the spin polarization of the qsh edge states ( fig .",
    "1b ) via the inverse spin hall effect@xcite ( she@xmath5 ) .",
    "second , our devices enable us to show that because of their helical nature , the qsh edge states can be used as a detector of spin current ( fig .",
    "1a ) . in our devices ,",
    "the spin current is generated by the intrinsic ballistic spin hall effect@xcite ( she ) exhibited by a hgte qw in the metallic regime @xcite .",
    "these two experiments establish for the first time spin polarization of the helical edge states in topological insulators , and also demonstrate potential applications of the qsh effect for spintronic devices .",
    "this document provides the details of our theoretical approach for the description of the hybrid quantum spin hall  metallic spin hall ( qsh - she ) ` h - bar ' structures illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "of the main text . more specifically , we calculate the nonlocal four - terminal resistance @xmath32 in the configuration illustrated in fig .",
    "1b and fig .",
    "[ fig : lb ] , where the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulator state acts as a spin current injector , and the metallic region as a spin current detector through the inverse spin hall effect ( she@xmath5 ) .",
    "the nonlocal resistance @xmath24 in the reverse geometry ( fig .",
    "1a ) , with voltage and current probes exchanged , is the same as @xmath32 by virtue of the onsager - casimir symmetry relations in the absence of a magnetic field ( refs .",
    ", and eq .  ( 1 ) of the main text ) .",
    "we find a good qualitative agreement between the experimental and theoretical values ( fig .  4 and 5 of the main text ) .",
    "the main idea of our approach is the following .",
    "we consider the h - bar geometry illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lb ] .",
    "the yellow region on the left is in the qsh regime , while the green region on the right is in the metallic regime , either @xmath6-type or @xmath7-type .",
    "figure  [ fig : lb ] represents the same setup as in fig .  1b , where @xmath46 corresponds to the length of the part of the structure in the metallic regime .",
    "we calculate the four - terminal nonlocal resistance @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the current injected into lead @xmath39 and collected in lead @xmath40 , and @xmath49 is the voltage difference between leads @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "an expression for @xmath32 in terms of the transmission coefficients @xmath43 from lead @xmath50 to lead @xmath51 , @xmath52 , can be derived from the multiprobe landauer - bttiker formula@xcite , with @xmath53 from time - reversal symmetry@xcite ( trs ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath54 in the qsh region are universal and are obtained simply by counting the number of edge states leading from one contact to the other ( see ref .",
    "in the same spirit , the coefficients @xmath55 can be approximated by counting the number of channels@xcite @xmath56 ( per spin ) in the vertical arm of width @xmath57 in the metallic t - structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lb ] ) , with @xmath58 the fermi wave vector in the metallic region .",
    "the nontrivial part of the calculation is to determine the coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the transmission between the contacts attached to the qsh region and those attached to the metallic region .",
    "since the right t - structure is metallic , for high enough densities the fermi wavelength @xmath61 is much smaller than the dimensions @xmath62 of the t - structure and a semiclassical approach becomes justified . in other words",
    ", there is a large number of channels @xmath63 in the metallic region and we can neglect the quantization of motion in the transverse direction .",
    "our approach for the calculation of @xmath64 is based on the monte carlo method for the simulation of semiclassical electron transport in semiconductors@xcite .",
    "this approach has been used successfully for the study of magnetotransport in multiprobe conductors@xcite , and in particular for the study of quasiballistic transport in hgte quantum wells@xcite .",
    "the procedure consists in injecting electrons with well - defined positions and momenta at the left of the metallic t - structure ; the qsh edge states then act as ` injectors ' of electrons into the metallic region .",
    "the electrons then propagate into the ballistic region according to semiclassical equations of motion@xcite , which include elastic scattering on the geometric boundaries of the t - structure , elastic scattering on nonmagnetic impurities through the inclusion of a phenomenological momentum relaxation time , and more importantly , the effect of spin - orbit coupling through the inclusion of a berry phase term@xcite which acts as a magnetic field in momentum space@xcite .",
    "this last term is responsible for the she and she@xmath5 .",
    "one then simply counts the fraction of electrons which reach contacts @xmath41 and @xmath42 , from which the classical transmission probabilities @xmath64 can be extracted@xcite .",
    "this document is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ seclb ] , we apply the multiprobe landauer - bttiker formula@xcite to the geometry of fig .  [",

    ") converts the spin accumulation into a voltage signal.,width=432 ]    before presenting our results , we first describe the principle of our experiment in more detail .",
    "since the magnetic field originating from spin polarized carriers in helical edge channels is too small to be detected directly , we have designed an experiment that converts magnetic information into an electrical signal .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the idea of the experiments , which are performed on an h - shaped mesa structure ( which we call ` h - bar ' ) in which the carrier concentration in the two legs of the ` h ' can be adjusted separately .",
    "consider the situation illustrated in fig .  1 , where the bottom leg is metallic ( indicated by the green color , and either @xmath6- or @xmath7-type ) and the top leg is tuned into the qsh regime ( indicated by the yellow color ) , with the counter - propagating helical edge channels depicted as blue and red trajectories .",
    "we perform two separate complementary experiments .    in fig .  1a ,",
    "the current is injected into the metallic part of the structure ( contacts 3 and 4 ) while a voltage signal is detected across the top leg ( contacts 1 and 2 ) , which is gated into the qsh insulator state . the inverted band structure in hgte results in a large spin - orbit coupling@xcite , which has previously enabled us to observe a ballistic intrinsic she in a small h - bar structure with a homogeneous carrier profile@xcite .",
    "similarly , when in the experiment of fig .",
    "1a a charge current is injected into the metallic leg , the intrinsic she will induce a separation of carriers with opposite spin polarizations toward opposite edges of this leg .",
    "this leads to a difference in chemical potential for opposite spin states in the area where the metallic part of the structures borders on the qsh region .",
    "the spin polarized helical edge channels coming from the qsh region couple selectively to the chemical potential of the matching spin species in the metallic region and transfer this difference in potential to voltage contacts 1 and 2 . for non - spin - selective edge channels the voltage signal is expected to be zero , while for the spin polarized qsh edge channels we expect a nonzero signal .",
    "thus the observation of a nonlocal signal in this configuration is evidence that the metallic leg develops an intrinsic she , as well as that the helical edge channels are spin polarized in the qsh insulator regime .    in the reverse configuration of fig .  1b , the current is injected ( contacts 1 and 2 ) into the area of the sample that is gated into the qsh regime , while a nonlocal voltage drop is measured across the metallic leg ( contacts 3 and 4 ) .",
    "in this configuration , the spin polarized helical edge channels inject a spin polarized current into the metallic leg , causing a local imbalance in the chemical potential of spin - up and spin - down polarized carriers . due to the she@xmath5 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the spin current in the metallic region induces a voltage between contacts 3 and 4 .",
    "again , this voltage can only develop provided the helical edge channels are spin polarized , and the metallic leg exhibits the she@xmath5 .",
    "a possible complication in both of the above experiments is the detection of a stray spreading voltage . in the configuration of fig .",
    "1a , this could result from a voltage drop in the metallic leg along the interface with the area in the qsh insulator regime , while in fig .",
    "1b , the finite distance between in- and outgoing edge channels at this interface could produce a similar effect .",
    "however , in practice such stray voltages are strongly reduced by the exact layout of the experiment , the quasi - ballistic nature of the transport in the metallic leg and the finite width of the edge channels . in the supplementary online material ( section vi )",
    ", we present theoretical models and experimental evidence showing that any residual stray voltages can be neglected as compared with the actual signals obtained in the experiments described below .",
    "our h - bar structures are fabricated from inverted hgte / hgcdte type - iii qws with a nominal well width of 9  nm , located 74  nm below the surface . at a temperature of 4  k ( and for a grounded gate ) , the carrier density is @xmath8  @xmath9 .",
    "the carrier mobility is then @xmath10  @xmath11(v@xmath12s ) , yielding an elastic mean free path larger than 2  @xmath13 m .",
    "the devices are patterned using optical and electron beam lithography , with dimensions as indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "in order to control the carrier density , the device is gated by au gate electrodes separated from the sample surface by a 110  nm thick insulating si@xmath14n@xmath15/sio@xmath16 multi - layer stack . by applying a voltage @xmath17 to the top gates ,",
    "the electron carrier density of the qw can be adjusted , going from an @xmath6-type behavior for @xmath18 through the bulk insulator state into a @xmath7-type regime for @xmath19 . for reasons of comparison , the experimental data in fig .",
    "2 , 3 and 4 are plotted as a function of a normalized gate voltage @xmath20 , where the threshold voltage @xmath21 is defined as the voltage for which the resistance is largest in a particular fixed reference measurement . as is evident from the characterization data in fig .",
    "2b and c , which were obtained from a hall bar fabricated from the same wafer material as the h - bar nanostructures , we find that for gate voltages @xmath22  v the qw is @xmath6-type metallic , and for @xmath23  v it is @xmath7-type metallic .",
    "the split - gate design ( gates 1 and 2 ) of fig .",
    "1 provides an independent control of the carrier density for each leg of the h - bar structure , enabling us to gate one part of the sample into the qsh insulator regime and the other part into either @xmath6- or @xmath7-type metallic regimes .",
    "an electron microscope picture of the actual device structure is shown in fig .",
    "the transport measurements are done at a constant temperature of 1.8  k employing quasi - dc low frequency ( 13  hz ) lock - in techniques using a voltage bias below 100  @xmath13v .",
    "while experiments have been performed on a variety of different devices and yield similar results , for reasons of consistency we will discuss here a single device with dimensions as indicated in fig .  1 . the results of the experiments are shown in figs .  3 and 4 , corresponding to the measurement configurations of figs .",
    "1a and b , respectively . in the upper three panels of the figures ,",
    "the nonlocal resistance is plotted as a function of gate 1 , while in the lower panel , gate 2 is swept .",
    "figure  3 corresponds to the layout of fig .  1a , and the detected nonlocal signal can consequently be denoted as @xmath24 , i.e. the voltage measured between contacts 1 and 2 divided by the current passed between contacts 3 and 4 .",
    "when we sweep the gate on the injector area ( gate 2 ) while the detector is tuned into the qsh regime ( @xmath25 ) , we observe ( lower panel in fig .",
    "3 ) a pronounced maximum around @xmath26 , and smaller but finite values on both sides .",
    "the signal around @xmath27 reaches approximately the quantized value observed in our previous experiments on nonlocal transport in the qsh regime@xcite .",
    "we attribute the slight deviation from perfect quantization to imperfect gating in the not gate - covered region between gates 1 and 2 .",
    "imperfectly gated regions in the sample can act as dephasing centers for edge electrons , which can lead to a deviation from the expected quantized nonlocal resistance@xcite .",
    "in addition , in hgte qw devices subsequent gate voltage sweeps can charge interface trap states in a different way@xcite , leading to different dephasing effects and a different magnitude of the deviation from quantized resistance for each gate voltage sweep .",
    "apart from the large signal in the qsh regime , the measurements also exhibit a non - vanishing nonlocal signal when the area underneath gate 2 is metallic , either @xmath6- or @xmath7-type , and thus corresponds to the injector region depicted in fig .",
    "the origin of this finite signal becomes more evident when the injector gate voltage is set at a fixed value either in the @xmath7-type ( @xmath28  v  @xmath29 ) or in the @xmath6-type metallic regime ( @xmath30  v  @xmath31 ) while the voltage on gate 1 is swept ( top panel of fig .",
    "3 ) . evidently ,",
    "a significant increase in the nonlocal signal is observed , with a peak when the detector is exactly in the qsh insulator regime .",
    "this is the observation anticipated above : one may expect a nonlocal signal of this amplitude only when the metallic leg exhibits a she and the edge channels in the qsh leg are spin polarized .",
    "our data also show that the nonlocal signal for the @xmath7-type injector ( @xmath28  v ) is more than ten times larger than that for the @xmath6-type injector ( @xmath30  v ) .",
    "this is consistent with our experimental observations on the she signal in all - metallic hgte qw@xcite , where the nonlocal signal is about an order of magnitude larger in the @xmath7-regime than in the @xmath6-regime and results from enhanced spin - orbit splitting in the valence band@xcite .    our data for the reverse configuration of fig .",
    "1b are shown in fig .",
    "the sweep of gate 2 in the bottom panel now corresponds to the detection leg , and one can directly see that also in this configuration we observe a finite nonlocal signal ( in this case @xmath32 ) , even when the detector is metallic ( red and green arrows ) .",
    "the upper panel shows the effect of sweeping the injector leg ( gate 1 ) , and indicates that the nonlocal signal peaks when the injector is in the qsh state . as in the previous configuration of fig .  3",
    ", we observe an order of magnitude increase in the nonlocal signal when the metallic detector is @xmath7-type ( @xmath33  v ) as compared with an @xmath6-type detector ( @xmath34  v ) .",
    "as noted above , our observation of the nonlocal signal is evidence that the helical edge channels generate a spin accumulation at the interface between the qsh injector and the metallic detector , which responds by the she@xmath5 .    the results in figs .  3 and 4 look very similar and , in fact ,",
    "are expected to do so on account of the onsager - casimir symmetry relations for the nonlocal resistances @xmath35 in a four - probe device@xcite , @xmath36 where the first pair of indices refers to the current probes , the second pair refers to the voltage probes , and @xmath37 is the magnetic field . in the present setup ,",
    "the magnetic field is zero and we expect @xmath38 .",
    "one possible explanation for the small deviations from exact onsager - casimir symmetry observed in fig .",
    "3 and 4 is the random charging effects of pinned inhomogeneities ( or ` trap states ' ) mentioned earlier .",
    "two subsequent gate voltage sweeps can result in a different interface potential due to these charging effects@xcite , which changes the internal state of the conductor .",
    "note however that the symmetry between fig .",
    "3 and 4 is more accurate in the doped regimes away from the nominally insulating regime , which is expected since a higher carrier density can more effectively screen the interface trap potentials and thus make the internal state of the conductor less sensitive to trap charging effects .",
    "in order to better understand the experimental results , we have performed semi - classical monte carlo calculations to obtain a theoretical estimate of the nonlocal resistance based on the sample geometry ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we focus on the setup illustrated in fig .  1b , where the qsh insulator acts as a spin injector and the metallic region detects the spin polarization of edge channels through the she@xmath5 .",
    "we calculate the nonlocal resistance @xmath32 when the current is driven between contacts @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the voltage is measured between contacts @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath32 can be expressed in terms of the transmission coefficients@xcite @xmath43 for the metallic region only ( eq .  s1 of the supplementary online material ) .",
    "the @xmath43 are calculated within the semiclassical monte carlo method @xcite , which is a reasonable approximation for fermi wavelengths @xmath44 where @xmath45  @xmath13 m is the characteristic linear size of the device ( fig .  1 and 2a ) .",
    "electrons are injected at the qsh - she@xmath5 interface ( yellow - green interface in fig .",
    "1b ) , and propagate quasi - ballistically into the metallic t - structure ( green region in fig .",
    "1b ) according to semiclassical equations of motion@xcite .",
    "these equations are derived using an effective 4-band model for hgte qw@xcite which explicitly contains the effects of intrinsic spin - orbit coupling due to atomic coupling between bands @xcite .",
    "this intrinsic spin - orbit coupling can be visualized as resulting from a rashba field due to the edges of a typical mesa structure used in experiments @xcite .",
    "details of the calculation are included in the supplementary online material .",
    "we find that the conversion of the spin signal to the electrical signal through the she@xmath5 is dominated by the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction while stray contributions due to voltage spreading are negligible ( see fig .",
    "s3 in the supplementary online material ) .",
    "5 shows the theoretical prediction of the nonlocal resistance signal as a function of the carrier concentration in the metallic detector .",
    "( note that the semiclassical simulation breaks down when the chemical potential is too close to the insulating gap . )",
    "the scattering induced by the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction is more effective when carriers have smaller kinetic energy , and therefore smaller wave vectors at the fermi level@xcite . since the effective mass in the @xmath7-regime is larger than that in the @xmath6-regime@xcite , for comparable densities the kinetic energy will be smaller in the @xmath7-regime",
    "this can explain the larger nonlocal resistance signal for the @xmath7-regime in comparison with the @xmath6-regime , as well as the decrease of the signal upon increase in carrier concentration .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented nonlocal transport experiments on split - gate hgte qw which establish for the first time the spin polarization of the helical edge states in topological insulators . together with our previous experiments on conductance quantization@xcite and nonlocal edge state transport@xcite ,",
    "the present data constitute the final piece of evidence needed to fully confirm the original predictions for this novel state of matter@xcite .",
    "our experiments yield a robust signal , in both experimental configurations where the helical edge channels are used for spin injection and detection .",
    "this opens a novel route for spintronics experiments in two - dimensional electron systems at zero external field .",

    "for simplicity , we assume that the probability of reflecting into a state with opposite spin is very small , so that we are effectively simulating the semiclassical dynamics of a two - component gas , with the two components evolving in a perfectly independent manner .",

    "the effect of @xmath134 on a particle is implemented into the simulation as follows : by energy and momentum conservation , when a particle hits a boundary we simply flip the sign of the component of its momentum normal to the boundary ( specular reflection ) . on the other hand , to take the effect of @xmath136 into account we proceed as follows .",
    "we first generate a random free flight time@xcite @xmath137 from an exponential distribution @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a phenomenological collision time .",

    "finally , a new random free flight time is generated , and the procedure starts again until all particles have exited the device through either contact @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath149 apart from boundary and impurity scattering , the berry phase term vanishes for free propagation inside the boundaries and the semiclassical trajectories between collisions are simply straight lines .",
    "the berry phase term generates a shift of position upon scattering on boundaries and impurities , an effect similar to the side - jump effect@xcite in the anomalous hall effect , with the exception that here the spin - orbit coupling is intrinsic ( arising from the bandstructure ) and not the spin - orbit coupling arising from impurity potentials . a scattering event resulting in a change of momentum @xmath150 produces a position shift @xmath151 given by @xmath152 which can also be written @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 depends on the boundary .",
    "equation  ( [ berrylorentz ] ) makes explicit the interpretation of the berry curvature @xmath156 as a magnetic field in momentum space .",

    "we expect that the discrepancy is due to the additional contribution from rashba spin - orbit coupling@xcite , which is not taken into account in the simple semiclassical approach with @xmath178 conservation used in this work .",
    "the increase of the nonlocal resistance signal with decreasing density ( fig .",
    "5 ) is evidence that the signal is generated by the spin - orbit interaction , i.e. the berry curvature term ( sec .  [ seceom ] ) .",
    "this can be understood if one remembers that the berry curvature can be treated approximately as the magnetic field in reciprocal space of a magnetic monopole@xcite centered at @xmath179 . as the density is reduced ( decreasing @xmath94 ) , the particles are closer to the monopole and feel a stronger berry magnetic field . furthermore , due to the larger effective",

    "we now present additional experimental and theoretical evidence that the observed nonlocal resistance signal is due to the spin - orbit interaction and not by some spurious effects . in fig .",

    "fig : injector_vary ] that the nonlocal resistance is essentially independent of the injector length .",
    "the maximum signal is obtained when the detector is in the qsh insulator regime , as expected from previous nonlocal transport measurements in the qsh regime ( see ref .",

    ", we expect that a nonlocal resistance signal originating from spin effects would depend strongly on the system size . by a solution of the poisson equation in the metallic t - structure we estimate that the stray diffusive signal for an ohmic conductor doubles when the metallic leg of the injector is reduced by half .",
    "therefore , a very weak dependence of the experimental nonlocal resistance on the injector length excludes the possibility that our result is a diffusive stray signal and constitutes evidence that our samples are in the quasi - ballistic regime .",
    "we now provide further theoretical evidence that our signal originates solely from the presence of strong spin - orbit interaction effects , i.e. the berry phase term ( sec .  [ seceom ] ) .",
