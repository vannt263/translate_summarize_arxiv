    "the standard cosmological model rests on the _ cosmological principle _ which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic . however , there are many indications from diverse data sets that this principle may not be applicable . in particular , polarizations of radio waves coming from distant radio galaxies ( birch 1982 ; jain and ralston 1999 ) , the optical polarizations from quasars ( hutsemkers 1998 ; hutsemkers and lamy 2001 , jain et al .",
    "2004 ) and the multipoles @xmath3 of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) all indicate a universal axis pointing in the direction of the virgo cluster ( de oliveira - costa et al . 2004 ; ralston and jain 2004 ; schwarz et al 2004 ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been called the _ virgo alignment _",
    "( ralston and jain 2004 ) .",
    "there have also been other claims of large scale anisotropy in the cmbr data .",
    "these include the dipole power modulation ( eriksen et al .",
    "2004 ; eriksen et al . 2007 ;",
    "hoftuft et al .",
    "2009 ) , as well as , the detection of an anomalously cold spot ( cruz et al . 2005 ) .",

    "2009 ) , also indicate deviations from isotropy . the preferred axis for the cluster peculiar velocities with a high redshift cut is again found to be close to the direction of virgo cluster . in the galaxy distribution surveys , the preferred axis appears to depend strongly on the cut made on the data .",

    "another interesting effect associated with quadrupole is its low power in comparison to the best fit lcdm model ( bennett et al .",
    "one may speculate that the observed quadrupole - octopole alignment is related to the observed low quadrupole power .",
    "it has been shown that in random realizations of pure cmb maps there is no correlation between the low quadrupole power and quadrupole - octopole alignment ( raki and schwarz 2007 ; sarkar et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "in the present paper , we analyze the alignment of cmbr quadrupole @xmath4 and octopole @xmath5 moments more closely . in ( slosar and seljak 2004 ) , it has been suggested that this alignment may be caused by the galactic foregrounds .",
    "these authors argue that most of the power of quadrupole and octopole lies in the most contaminated region of the sky .",
    "hence , it is entirely possible that these multipoles may be significantly contaminated and the alignment may be caused due to poor cleaning .    in the internal power spectrum estimation ( ipse )",
    "procedure ( saha et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ; samal et al . 2010 ) the cleaning is performed by a totally blind procedure without making any explicit model for foregrounds .",
    "the foregrounds are removed by adding maps , in harmonic space , at different frequencies with suitable weights , chosen so as to minimize the foreground power .",
    "the internal linear combination ( ilc ) map provided by the wmap team ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) also uses a similar cleaning procedure . here",
    "the weighted maps are added directly in pixel space .",
    "both of these procedures are highly effective in removing foregrounds .",
    "however some residual foregrounds may still contaminate the data . besides this , ( saha et al .",
    "2008 ; samal et al . 2010 ) pointed out the existence of bias in the low @xmath6 multipoles extracted from foreground cleaned maps .",
    "this bias leads to a significant reduction of extracted power in these multipoles .",
    "in fact , the bias completely explains the observed low power at @xmath7 , in comparison to the best fit theoretical lcdm model .",
    "it is clearly important to determine what the low @xmath6 bias might imply for the alignment of these multipoles .",
    "it is possible that the power gets eliminated in just the precise manner in order to cause alignment .",
    "here we study whether any of these residual effects , present in the foreground cleaned data , may cause the observed quadrupole - octopole alignment .",
    "it is important to note that the observed alignment is only getting better with more data .",
    "a larger data sample implies smaller uncertainties due to detector noise .",
    "hence the signal becomes more prominent as the fluctuations due to detector noise get suppressed .",
    "the problem of testing violation of isotropy in the cmbr signal has been addressed by many authors .",
    "the cmbr anisotropy spectrum is generally assumed to be isotropic in a statistical sense .",
    "the assumption of statistical isotropy of the cmbr signal means that the spectral coefficients , @xmath8 , are uncorrelated for different @xmath9 and @xmath6 , i.e. the ensemble average , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the standard power .",
    "a multitude of statistics have been proposed in order to test for deviation from statistical isotropy in the cmbr data ( hajian et al .",

    "we shall use the method introduced in ( ralston and jain 2004 ) and further developed in ( samal et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) . in this procedure ,",
    "one assigns three orthogonal unit vectors for each multipole .",
    "the orientation of these vectors as well as the power associated with each vector contains information about possible violation of statistical isotropy .",
    "this information is encoded in two entropy measures , the power entropy and alignment entropy , defined in ( samal et al .",
    "using this method one can test for violation of isotropy for each individual multipoles or collectively over a range of multipoles .",
    "we present an outline of our analysis procedure in the next section followed by results from cosmological data and simulations and conclusions in the end .",
    "the primary objective of the present paper is to determine whether the alignment of quadrupole and octopole can be caused by foreground contamination .",
    "the alignment of different multipoles can be quantified by associating a frame with each multipole ( ralston and jain 2004 ; samal et al .",
    "2008 ) . in order to analyse the effect of foreground contamination we first perform an analytic calculation of the power tensor , introduced in ( ralston and jain 2004 ; samal et al . 2008 ) , within the framework of ipse technique ( saha et al . 2006 , 2008 ;",
    "samal et al .",
    "2010 ) . here",
    "we confine ourselves to the simple case of one foreground component following rigid frequency scaling and two frequency bands .",
    "this computation is useful to determine if the low @xmath6 bias also leads to violation of statistical isotropy .",
    "we then numerically determine the effect of this bias and residual foregrounds on the alignment of quadrupole and octopole .",
    "we generate many random realizations of the cmbr maps including foregrounds and detector noise .",
    "we use the planck sky model ( psm ) for foregrounds and use all the five wmap frequency bands .",
    "these simulated raw maps are cleaned using the ipse technique .",
    "we study the difference in the extracted principal eigenvectors of cleaned maps and simulated pure cmb maps .",
    "this allows us to determine if the residual foregrounds lead to any preferential alignment of these extracted vectors .    in the next subsections , we briefly review the extraction of frames and the ipse technique .",
    "the present study utilizes a symmetry based statistic ( samal et al .",
    "2008 ) to test for statistical isotropy in the cmbr data .",
    "the method associates a wave function @xmath12 , defined as , @xmath13 with every multipole @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath14 contains information about the spectral moments , such that , @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the eigenstates of the angular momentum operators @xmath17 , @xmath18 in the spin-@xmath6 representation .",
    "the wave function @xmath12 is useful since it assigns a frame , i.e. three orthonormal vectors , at each @xmath6 .",
    "the frame may be extracted by making a singular value decomposition of the wave function .",
    "it is also convenient to define the power tensor , @xmath19 the three eigenvectors , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , of this matrix define the frame associated with each multipole .",
    "the index , @xmath22 , labels the three components of each eigenvector .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues , @xmath23 , contain information about the power associated with each eigenvector .",
    "the sum of the three eigenvalues equals the total power , @xmath11 .",
    "a large dispersion in the eigenvalues indicates violation of statistical isotropy for a particular mode .",
    "we define the principal pigenvector ( pev ) , @xmath24 , as the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue . here",
    "we note that the extracted pevs are headless , meaning , these vectors specify only an axis and not a direction .",
    "the p - value or the significance of alignment of the quadrupole and octopole pev may be estimated analytically by the formula @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the angle between the pevs @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which correspond to @xmath7 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "alternatively , one can estimate the significance directly by numerical simulations , as described below .",
    "the ipse procedure removes the foreground contamination by linearly combining maps at different frequencies with suitable weights in harmonic space .",
    "the cleaning is accomplished independently for each @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the weights for the map at frequency channel @xmath31 corresponding to the multipole @xmath6 . in case",
    "we have several maps at a particular frequency , we simply take their average .",
    "the spherical harmonic components of the cleaned map are given by , @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the total number of frequency channels used for cleaning .",

    "2006 ; delabrouille and cardoso 2009 ) . its @xmath47 matrix element may be expressed as , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the cross power spectrum between the @xmath50 and @xmath51 channel , @xmath52 the final cleaned map may be used to extract the power spectrum as well as the pevs needed for the present study .",
    "the power spectrum is given by , @xmath53 this would be reliable at low @xmath6 , where the detector noise is negligible . for our present purpose ,",
    "this is sufficient .",
    "however at high @xmath54 , where the detector noise is not negligible , a more elaborate procedure is necessary , as discussed in ( saha et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the procedure contains some bias which can be estimated from simulations .",
    "an important bias arises due to inefficient cleaning in the galactic plane .",
    "a similar bias is also present in the procedure used by wmap science team in generating the ilc map . as a final step in generating this map ,",
    "a ` bias ' correction based on monte carlo simulations is applied by the wmap science team ( hinshaw et al .",
    "we employ a similar procedure to correct for any residual foreground bias by subtracting a ` bias map ' generated from the simulated maps , in pixel space .",
    "another interesting bias arises due to the cross correlation term between the foregrounds and the cmb signal in the calculation of cmb power .",
    "this bias is negative and affects dominantly the very low multipoles .",
    "this can also be estimated by simulations , but may also be represented analytically by using some simplifying assumptions ( saha et al .",
    "2008 ) .      in order to study the effect of foregrounds on the detected anisotropy in cmbr",
    ", we generate an ensemble of 500 cmb maps as random realizations of the best fit theoretical power spectrum , available at the nasa s wmap public domain website .",
    "these simulated  pure \" cmb maps are generated using the publicly available healpix software .",
    "eventually , these pure cmb maps are contaminated with galactic foregrounds and gaussian random noise with appropriate dispersion per pixel .",
    "the foregrounds are generated using the psm , which contains only thermal dust , synchrotron and free - free emission .",
    "these are the dominant foregrounds , as characterised by wmap science team also , in all its data releases so far ( gold et al . 2010 ) . the effective number of observations needed to generate the noise maps are taken from temperature maps of wmap 5 year and 7 year data releases , available in fits format at nasa s lambda website .",
    "these simulated cmb maps are then passed through a cleaning pipeline using the ipse procedure .",
    "this produces a full sky cleaned map corresponding to each random realization which can be used to study the alignment between quadrupole and octopole . by comparing observations with the random samples , we can easily estimate the significance level of the observed alignment .",
    "furthermore , we can study how the pevs in the extracted clean cmb maps differ from those of pure cmb maps .",
    "this can reveal any systematic bias which may be present in the pevs of cleaned maps . due to the presence of residual foregrounds and negative bias at low @xmath6",
    ", we expect that the corresponding eigenvectors may also be biased . here",
    "we shall study this bias and its effect on alignment of quadrupole and octopole .",
    "in this section we evaluate analytically how the low-_l _ negative bias affects the power tensor . for simplicity",
    "we assume that there is only one significant foreground component , which follows rigid frequency scaling .",
    "furthermore we assume only two frequency bands in the cmb data analysis .",
    "the detector noise is assumed to be negligible , which is a reasonable assumption at low-@xmath6 .",
    "for simplicity we also set the beam transform function to unity .",

    "it follows from the _ cosmological principle _ that the fluctuations in cmbr are statistically isotropic .",
    "hence we expect for a pure cmb map , @xmath60 here we compute the ensemble average of the power tensor for the cleaned map . this will show us whether the bias generated due to foreground cleaning leads to anisotropy in the power tensor .",
    "the spherical harmonic coefficients of a cleaned map can be written as , @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes any residual foreground contamination in the cleaned map , @xmath63 in order to estimate the bias in power tensor , we need to calculate , @xmath64 the first term follows from the assumption that cmb signal is statistically isotropic .",

    "the elements of the empirical covariance matrix are given by , @xmath67 we get the last line after carrying out the multiplications in the second line and @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote cross correlations between the cmb and foregrounds at frequency bands @xmath31 and @xmath65 , respectively .",

    "a foreground for which the approximation of a constant value of @xmath87 over the entire sky holds is said to follow rigid frequency scaling , though , in a most general case @xmath87 is a function of position of the sky , @xmath88 .",
    "if for a foreground , the assumption of constant @xmath87 is not reasonable , one can model the variation in terms of two components each of which follows rigid scaling ( bouchet and gispert 1999 ) .",
    "so , in that case , @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes average spectral index of the foreground , @xmath91 , over the entire sky and @xmath92 are two templates of the foreground .",
    "a very strong variation may require more than two templates for modelling .    here , assuming a rigid scaling behaviour for the foreground component , we model the spectral coefficients of the foreground in a frequency band @xmath65 as , @xmath93 now , eq .

    "[ alm_ens_avg ] , @xmath98 hence we find that the low-@xmath6 negative bias term leads to an anisotropic power tensor . as discussed in ( saha et al .",

    "we also expect a positive contribution due to residual foreground contamination .",
    "this arises due to foregrounds which may not be eliminated by our cleaning procedure . by explicit numerical computation",
    "we find that the pev of the power tensor corresponding to eq .",
    "[ eq : lowlbias ] is well aligned with the galactic poles .",
    "the two orthogonal vectors of the power tensor lie in the galactic plane .",
    "this is of course expected since the eigenvectors are determined entirely by the galactic foregrounds , which are present predominantly along the galactic plane .",
    "the main result of this section is that power tensor corresponding to the cleaned map acquires an anisotropic contribution due to low-@xmath6 negative bias .",
    "this contribution arises even in the case of perfect cleaning when we have sufficient frequency channels to remove all the foregrounds present in the data .",
    "although we have made several simplifying assumptions , this basic result is expected to hold in general . our analytic results in this section",

    "we , first , present the results from actual cosmological data and then discuss the simulation results .",
    "the pevs , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , for the quadrupole and octopole , respectively , from different clean maps extracted from the wmap data are given in table [ [ tab_pev ] ] .",

    "in contrast , the ipse map is obtained by making linear combinations in harmonic space .",
    "we point out that , the bias removal leads to a significantly improved cleaning in the galactic plane and has already been applied in the publicly available ilc map .",

    "the main difference between these two maps is that a significant foreground contamination in the galactic plane has been removed during the process of bias removal .",
    "this suggests that the effect of foregrounds is to distort the signal of alignment rather than to cause alignment .",
    "we also notice from table[[tab_pev ] ] that , as we remove the bias in the ipse map , the octopole pev changes only by a negligible amount , whereas the quadrupole undergoes a significantly large change .",
    "indeed , after bias removal , the quadrupole pev is relatively close to that corresponding to the ilc map .",
    "the ipse octopole pev agrees well with that obtained from ilc map , irrespective of whether the bias is removed or not .",

    "the simulated maps containing cmb , foregrounds and detector noise are cleaned using the ipse procedure . in each of the simulated maps , the bias due to foreground power in the galactic plane is removed in exactly the same manner as in the real data . even after removing this bias",

    "we determine the number of random realizations of cmb data which show better alignment in comparison to what is observed .",
    "the probability is obtained by dividing this number by the total number of random samples .",
    "here we use both the randomly generated pure cmb maps as well as simulated foreground cleaned maps . for the bias",
    "corrected ipse five year map we find that the probability is 0.004 if we use the simulated pure cmb maps .",
    "the probability remains unchanged if it is computed by using the simulated cleaned maps .",
    "the corresponding numbers for the seven year maps are 0.004 and 0.002 for the simulated pure cmb maps and the cleaned maps respectively .",
    "the result remains unchanged if we apply the residual foreground bias correction to the simulated cleaned maps .",
    "these results agree well with those given in table 2 .",
    "hence we find no evidence for any systematic effect which may cause alignment of pevs , despite the presence of a systematic effect on power , @xmath120 .",
    "we do find a systematic shift of the pevs away from the galactic plane .",
    "however the final pevs point in random directions .",
    "hence rather than causing alignment , this effect has a tendency to distort any signal of alignment that might be present in the original sample .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier , the negative bias does cause a systematic reduction of power for low @xmath6 multipoles .",
    "this is seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ [ sum_eigen_l2 ] ] where we plot the sum of the eigenvalues of the power tensor for @xmath121 both for simulated pure and cleaned , bias corrected , maps .",
    "the sum of eigenvalues equals the total power , @xmath11 , for each multipole .",
    "we find a systematic negative shift in the power for each random realization . after taking the average over all the simulations",
    ", we find that quadrupole power of the cleaned map is lower by 39 % in comparison to that of the pure cmb map .",
    "the corresponding octopole power gets reduced by 22 % .",
    "we next assume that the alignment is caused by some effect other than foreground contamination .",
    "the foregrounds lead to a random shift in the pevs causing a certain level of misalignment .",
    "hence the angle between @xmath7 and @xmath29 pevs must not be very small in comparison to the shift caused by foregrounds .",
    "the shift of the pevs is quantified by the distribution plot shown in fig .",
    "[ [ hist_cos_alpha ] ] . this should be associated with the randomness that the cleaning process introduces in the extraction of the pev .",
    "we find that probability of chance alignment for the ipse cleaned five year and seven year map , after bias correction , is @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "we find that about 16% of the simulations have @xmath124 . at high galactic latitudes , corresponding to the virgo alignment axis ,",
    "this number is higher .",
    "it is reassuring that the number of random samples which show a shift in the pev less than the observed alignment in the ipse cleaned map is not too small .",
    "we have studied the effect of foreground cleaning on the alignment of low @xmath6 multipoles , @xmath121 .",
    "it has been speculated in the past that the alignment may be caused by foreground contamination .",
    "the presence of residual foreground power in the cleaned cmb maps could lead to violation of statistical isotropy and hence alignment of low @xmath6 multipoles .",
    "furthermore , even in the case of perfect cleaning , the extracted power contains a negative bias , which is quite significant at low @xmath6 .",
    "this has been shown explicitly in the case of the ipse procedure .",
    "we anticipate the presence of such a bias also in the ilc map but this requires further study .",
    "using the ipse procedure , we analytically compute the power tensor using some simplifying assumptions .",
    "we find that its ensemble average is not proportional to an identity matrix due to the presence of the low @xmath6 bias .",
    "hence this implies a violation of statistical isotropy .",
    "we next perform detailed numerical simulations within the framework of the ipse method to determine the effect of foregrounds on the observed alignment .",
    "our ipse simulation results , obtained using 500 randomly generated samples , show that the pevs extracted from foreground cleaned maps are generally in good agreement with those obtained from pure cmb maps . in most cases the shift in pevs is observed to be small .",
    "the largest change is seen in the case of quadrupole .",
    "the shift is dominant for pevs which initially lie close to the galactic plane . in general , we find that the pevs tend to get pushed away from the galactic plane towards the galactic poles .",
    "similar trend is also seen in the case of octopole but with much reduced significance .",
    "we do not , however , see any evidence for alignment among the quadrupole and octopole pevs extracted from the foreground cleaned maps .",
    "the significance or p - values extracted by using simulated cleaned maps are found to be in good agreement with those obtained by using simulated pure cmb maps .",
    "these also show good agreement with the results obtained analytically and listed in table 2 .",
    "hence despite the systematic shift of pevs away from the galactic plane , as observed dominantly in the case of quadrupole , we find that foregrounds do not cause alignment of quadrupole and octopole .",
    "this is because the change in pevs due to foreground cleaning is generally small and mostly in random directions .",
    "one might be tempted to propose a scenario where the shift towards galactic poles is a much more significant effect which may be caused by the presence of much stronger level of foreground contamination . in this case",
    "it is conceivable that the pevs extracted from the foreground cleaned maps would point dominantly towards the galactic poles and hence show alignment .",
    "however this would require a very large foreground contamination in comparison to currently accepted model .",
    "the level of contamination has to be sufficiently large so that both the quadrupole and octopole pevs tend to align with the galactic poles .",
    "although the quadrupole shows a somewhat significant shift of pevs away from galactic plane , this trend is barely noticeable in the case of octopole .",
    "we emphasize that even in the case of quadrupole the shift of pev is very small in most cases .",
    "furthermore such a proposal will imply that the direction of alignment points towards the galactic poles which is not consistent with the observed axis .",
    "hence we conclude that foreground contamination is very unlikely to cause the observed alignment .    due to the random nature of the shift caused by foreground cleaning , it is more likely to cause misalignment of multipoles .",
    "we see this clearly by comparing the results using ipse before and after removing the bias due to foreground contamination in the galactic plane . the alignment is found to be much stronger after removing the residual foreground bias which arises due to remnant foregrounds , present in our cleaned maps .",
    "it is extracted by simulations using the psm for foregrounds and then removed from the cleaned map .",
    "furthermore we see that alignment becomes much more significant as more data is accumulated .",
    "the alignment seen in seven year data , for example , is much better than seen in five year data which in turn is better than that seen in three year data .",
    "this is clearly caused by reduced uncertainties as more data accumulates .",
    "hence we conclude that both the foregrounds and detector noise are more likely to distort , rather than cause , the signal of alignment .",
