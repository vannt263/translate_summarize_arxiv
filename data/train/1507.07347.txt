    "discrete element method ( dem ) simulations have been used extensively to study the motion of granular materials in many situations as a predictive tool as well as to obtain data that is otherwise inaccessible experimentally . in the method each particle s motion is governed by newton s laws : the goal is to compute the evolution of linear and angular momentum of every individual particle by using appropriate contact force models @xcite . while early dem simulations could manage systems with only a few hundred to tens of thousands of particles @xcite , simulating millions of particles is now practical with advances in computer technology .    as with many simulation approaches ,",
    "one of the key aspects is the implementation of boundary conditions .",
    "two types of wall boundary conditions can be implemented in dem simulations for the calculation of the collision force between mobile granular particles and the walls : 1 ) geometrically smooth surfaces , which are assumed to have infinite mass and a specified radius of curvature ( infinite for planar walls ) ( for example , see @xcite ) ; and 2 ) a geometrically rough surface made up of a closely packed monolayer of fixed particles conforming to the geometry of the wall surface ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter approach , often called a `` rough wall , '' is easy to implement because interactions between mobile particles and immobile wall particles are modeled in almost exactly the same way as between pairs of mobile particles .",
    "the only difference is that the wall particles remain fixed in their wall position .",
    "an implicit assumption is typically that a rough wall differs from a smooth wall only locally at the particle scale or perhaps through the thickness of the flowing layer , which is typically @xmath0 particles thick @xcite , but is unlikely to have a global effect on the flow , particularly far from the wall .",
    "likewise , it is often implicitly assumed that a rough wall is similar to a smooth wall , but one with a very high coefficient of friction .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the impact of the wall boundary condition on the flow using the system of monodisperse particles in a partially - filled spherical tumbler rotating with angular velocity @xmath1 about a horizontal axis ( fig .",
    "[ spherecoord ] ) .",
    "is the polar axis , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are in the equatorial plane . ]",
    "we consider the situation where the free surface is essentially flat and continuously flowing . in this regime ,",
    "the surface of the flowing layer maintains a dynamic angle of repose @xmath4 with respect to horizontal , which depends on the frictional properties and diameter @xmath5 of the particles and the rotational speed of the tumbler @xcite .",
    "in spherical tumblers , it has been shown that monodisperse particles slowly drift axially toward the pole near the surface of the flowing layer , while they drift axially toward the equator deep in the flowing layer with an axis of symmetry at the equator @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the deformation of an initially vertical band of colored particles in a 30% full spherical tumbler shown in fig .",
    "[ drift1mm](a ) . in this figure ,",
    "the axis of rotation is horizontal , and the front half of the bed of 1  mm diameter particles has been removed to view a cross - section of the particles . in fig .",
    "[ drift1 mm ] , after 2 circulations of particles through the flowing layer , the initially vertical band of colored particles is more slightly deformed in the case of a rough wall ( 1  mm diameter particles forming the wall ) in fig .",
    "[ drift1mm](c ) than in the case of a smooth wall in fig .",
    "[ drift1mm](b ) . to generate these images",
    ", it was necessary to choose a time corresponding to an integer number of circulations of particles through the flowing layer so that particles that were in the static bed return to the static bed and particles in flowing layer return to the flowing layer . to do this",
    ", we measured the average recirculation time of all particles : 2.14  s for the smooth case and 2.04  s for the rough case .",
    "this recirculation time difference does not come from slip between the smooth wall and the granular media in solid body rotation .",
    "this difference is instead due to a global modification of the flow due to the wall roughness .",
    "the deformation of the colored band comes about from asymmetries in the curvature of particle trajectories in the flowing layer that result in poleward drift near the free surface @xcite .",
    "mass conservation requires equator - directed drift deeper in the flowing layer .",
    "although our previous study @xcite indicated that the axial drift occurs for both smooth and rough walls , the degree of axial drift was not studied in detail .",
    "it is the unexpectedly strong influence of wall roughness on deformation of a labeled band in fig .",
    "[ drift1 mm ] , that we examine primarily through simulations in order to better understand the impact of wall boundary conditions in dem simulations and experiments .",
    "by way of background , the wall roughness has been shown to affect the flow of granular media in cases like chute flows and shear cell flows .",
    "for instance , the roughness of the bottom wall in chute flow has an impact on velocity @xcite and velocity profile @xcite . in planar",
    "shear flows @xcite , a smooth wall results in a slip velocity at the wall and large velocity gradients near the wall , whereas a rough wall results in no slip velocity and a nearly uniform velocity gradients . in both chute flow and planar",
    "shear flow , the impact of wall roughness on the flowing layer in the immediate vicinity is quite direct .",
    "the frictional effects at the wall alter the local shear rate at the wall , which propagates through the thickness of the entire flowing layer to affect the velocity profile . for granular flows in pipes , wall roughness can prevent clogging and jamming regimes by deflecting particles toward the center of the pipe @xcite . the case studied here , the wall only contacts the flowing layer at its circular periphery , not at the bottom of the flowing layer , which is in contact with the underlying bed of particles that is rotating in solid body motion with the tumbler .",
    "thus , the impact of the wall roughness is quite different and much less direct .",

    "[ comparetrajroughsmooth ] . first , the trajectories in the flowing layer for both cases are curved , with the curvature for smooth walls much greater than that for rough walls .",

    "second , the trajectories for the smooth - walled tumbler are nearly closed , displaying only a very small amount of poleward drift with each pass through the flowing layer . on the other hand ,",

    "[ comparetrajroughsmooth ] experimentally using tracer particles in a tumbler under similar conditions .",

    "thus , obtaining highly - resolved experimental mean trajectories of tracer particles is challenging . to overcome these problems ,",
    "we have used an x - ray system to track the location of a single x - ray opaque tracer particle in a 14  cm spherical tumbler that is 30% filled by volume with 2  mm spherical glass particles rotating at 6.5  rpm , the maximum speed for which a tracer particle can be accurately tracked .",
    "the tracer particle is 3  mm , so it remains near the surface of the flowing layer , but it still follows the general trajectory of the 2  mm particles based on direct visual observation in the smooth tumbler , an approach we have used successfully in the past @xcite .",

    "the poleward drift in a smooth wall tumbler is close to zero in all cases ( fig .",

    "[ comparetrajroughsmooth ] and our previous results for the amount of axial drift in a tumbler with smooth walls @xcite .",

    "that is , curvature of the trajectories , and hence displacement , is larger for smooth tumbler walls , while axial drift is greater for rough tumbler walls . due to the difficulty in performing these experiments , we focus on simulation results in the remainder of the paper .",

    "for other cases , the band deformation is directly linked with the drift of the trajectories : for any particular fill level , more drift results in greater band deformation for the rough case .",
    "the larger axial drift for rough walls is a consequence of the particle trajectories curving toward the pole in the upper part of the flowing layer , but not curving back toward the equator in the lower part .",

    "larger roughnesses ( fig .",

    "both the displacement and drift decrease when the wall particle size exceeds the flowing particle size of 2  mm .",
    "drift becomes progressively comparable to displacement as the roughness increases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ roughness5 ] where drift and displacement are plotted versus wall roughness .",
    "the displacement decreases until a roughness around 4  mm , above which it slightly increases and then remains constant .",
    "this evolution is very similar to the case of a rough incline in that the maximum friction occurs for a roughness of the wall corresponding to wall particles approximately twice the size of the flowing particles , while for larger roughnesses , the friction slightly decreases and then reaches a constant value @xcite .    the dependence of the drift on the wall particle size is complex , since it results from both the displacement toward the pole and the return curvature back toward the equator .",
    "the drift increases with increasing roughness up to 2  mm roughness and then decreases slightly so that it is nearly the same as the displacement . as noted earlier , the trajectories curve toward the pole in the upper portion of the flowing layer for both smooth and rough walls , but the trajectories do not curve back toward the equator in the lower portion of the flowing layer for walls of 2  mm roughness and greater , as shown in fig .

    "this behaviour is consistent with the trajectories of the particles in the flow . in the upstream portion of the flowing layer ,",

    "second , the velocities of particles within a distance of 1.5 particle radii from the wall and close to the free surface were directly measured .",
    "regardless of the method used to estimate the slip velocity , fig .",
    "[ wallslip30 ] shows that the slip at the wall decreases with roughness reaching a limit value at around 3  mm wall roughness , above which increasing roughness does not further affect the wall slip .",
    "note that this value is similar to the roughness in fig .",
    "[ roughness5 ] where the displacement and drift become similar .",
    "this result is likely analogous to the situation of an incline in which the maximum friction inducing a minimum flow velocity occurs when the roughness of the incline is approximatively twice the size of the flowing beads @xcite",
    ".     plane for 4 different roughnesses in a 30% filled spherical tumbler .",
    "]    the impact of the wall boundary condition on the overall flow is also evident in the streamwise velocity ( normal to the axis of rotation and in the flowing layer surface ) profile at the mid - length of the flowing layer measured 2  mm below the surface ( fig .",
    "[ meanprofile ] ) . in the smooth wall case ,",
    "the velocity near the wall is higher due to slip . as a result ,",
    "the velocity is lower at the equator .",
    "similar results occur deeper in the flowing layer , as well .",
    "it is this difference in the streamwise velocity profiles , combined with the higher flux of particles at the equator as the flowing layer thins for rough walls near its boundary ( figs .",
    "[ vzero30p ] and [ vzero2050 ] ) that causes the longer recirculation times in the smooth case than in the rough case , noted with respect to fig .",
    "[ drift1 mm ] .      finally , we vary both the rotational speed of the tumbler @xmath1 and the ratio of tumbler diameter to particle size ( @xmath56 ) and find that drift and displacement of the trajectories occur even when these key parameters are varied .",
    "consider first results for variations of the rotational speed , shown in fig .",
    "[ velocitydrift ] ,    m , @xmath49 and 2  mm above the bottom wall , for a spherical tumbler filled at 30% with 2  mm particles at various rotation speeds .",
    "the walls are perfectly smooth or 2  mm rough . ]    for 2  mm particles with smooth and 2  mm rough tumbler walls .",
    "the displacements for both smooth and rough tumbler walls increase with rotational speed , though the displacements for smooth walls are about twice that for rough tumbler walls .",
    "the drift varies little with rotational speed for rough tumbler walls , but decreases slightly with increasing rotational speed for smooth tumbler walls so that it becomes slightly negative by 30  rpm .",
    "the difference between smooth walls and rough walls increases with rotation speed for both the drift and the displacement .",
    "perhaps more interesting is the effect of the tumbler diameter to particle size radio ( @xmath56 ) , given that wall roughness affects the flow surprisingly far from the wall for 2  mm particles in a 14  cm tumbler ( @xmath57 ) . to examine this , we plot particle trajectories for particles that are double and half the particle size used elsewhere in this paper ( @xmath58  mm and @xmath25  mm ) in fig  [ wallsize ] .        for both smooth and rough walls ,",
    "large particles have larger displacement than small particles , but the drift only weakly depends on particle size , except for the largest particles . clearly , the wall roughness significantly affects the flow in all cases , though the impact decreases as the particle size relative to the tumbler size decreases .",
    "m , @xmath49 , and 4  mm above the sphere wall for a tumbler filled at 30% . ]",
    "figure  [ sizedrift ] shows the difference between smooth and rough wall cases for the displacement and the drift for particle sizes ranging from 1  mm to 4  mm in a 14  cm tumbler .",
    "both displacement and drift differences tend to zero with decreasing particle size , but the decrease is nearly linear .",
    "this suggests a remarkable persistence while approaching zero , suggesting that the impact of wall roughness on flow far from the wall persists even to fairly large values of @xmath56 .",
    "unfortunately , it is quite difficult to confirm this , since simulations for particles smaller than 1  mm require a very large number of particles and very long computation times .",
    "the impact of wall roughness on details of the flow , even far from the bounding wall , can be significant . in a spherical tumbler , wall roughness combined with a curvature of the wall determine the degree of slip at the wall , which in turn affects the flowing layer thickness near the wall . with rough walls and wall orientation such that particles impinge on the wall ( the downstream portion of the flowing layer in the spherical tumbler ) , the resulting decrease in the flowing layer thickness near the wall forces the downstream flux of particles away from the wall .",
    "this alters the particle trajectories and the flow even at the equator of the tumbler . on the other hand , smooth walls and wall orientation where particles fall away from the wall",
    "result in a higher slip velocity at the wall and consequently , less impact on the flowing layer thickness near the wall .",
    "this allows a higher flux of particles near the wall .",
    "the implications for dem simulations are significant . even in situations where the walls contact only the periphery of the flow , such as the case of a spherical tumbler , the choice of wall roughness is critical .",
    "preliminary results suggest a similar situation for cylindrical tumblers .",
    "of course , the wall roughness also affects other granular flows , such as straight chute flows , but in these cases the lower wall directly contacts the bottom of the flowing layer , so its impact is not surprising . the global impact of the peripheral flow boundaries may also play a role in situations in which segregation occurs .",
    "for instance , bidisperse segregation in spherical tumblers @xcite and even band formation in bidisperse flows in cylindrical tumblers , where the initial band formation seems to be driven by friction at the cylinder endwalls @xcite , may be strongly affected by the wall roughness far from the bounding walls .",
    "we are investigating these issues further .",
