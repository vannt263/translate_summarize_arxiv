    "a challenge in biology is to understand how complex regulatory networks in a cell execute different biological functions , such as the dna replication event and mitosis event in eukaryotic cell cycle processes , orderly and reliably .",
    "we call the process as the sequential - task process . in this work ,",
    "we establish a simplified toy model for a budding yeast cell cycle , and develop the analysis methods to describe the evolving process .",
    "our results show that the cell cycle process is an excitable system with global robustness towards different initial states , where the phase transitions of the cell cycle are controlled by feedback in the network and driven by bifurcations with a slow passage that we refer to as a ghost effect .",
    "these ghost effect bifurcations are sufficient for providing both the longer duration of each event and the modularity in state / parameter space .",
    "the modularity and decoupling of the kinetic parameters in different events ensures the stability of the system against parameter changes ; thus small parameter changes in any given event should not influence the general character of the cell cycle process .",
    "we describe this as the wave transition `` domino '' model of the cell cycle .",
    "this wave transition model not only provides an efficient and easily controlled strategy for the cell cycle , but also suggests a guide for building synthetic networks of sequential - task processes .",
    "it has been suggested that dynamic robustness and modularity are the important characteristics of a cellular regulatory network for fulfilling complex biological processes .",
    "recent progress in quantitative modeling and experiments of some fundamental cellular processes , including the chemotaxis in e. coli @xcite and the cell cycle process in yeast and oocyte , have provided a better systematic and quantitative view of these biological processes .",
    "these studies have revealed the structural and dynamic properties of regulatory networks , such as the basic motifs and modules of network structure @xcite , the feedback loops that dynamically control the genetic switches and transitions@xcite , and the dynamic stability and robustness of such networks@xcite .    in the cell cycle process",
    ", the cell successively executes dna replication and mitosis events using a checkpoint mechanism .",
    "the dynamic regulatory mechanism in cell cycle processes was revealed by the pioneering work of tyson , novak , and ferrell @xcite .",
    "the cell cycle process is considered to be a series of irreversible transitions from one state to another @xcite , which is regulated by system - level feedback @xcite .",
    "for example , the cell cycle process in oocyte maturation is built upon a hysteretic switch with two saddle - node bifurcations @xcite .",
    "the skeleton models of the cell cycle in a budding yeast @xcite and mammalian cells @xcite have also been established to investigate the temporal order and sequential activation in the cell cycle .",
    "furthermore , a dna replication checkpoint in a mammalian cell cycle has been proposed to lengthen the cell cycle period and lead to a better separation of the s and m phases @xcite .    to reveal the essential dynamic properties of a sequential - task cell cycle process",

    "for instance , how can the cell cycle network ensure the cell reliably executes a successive order of events ?",
    "how does the network ensure that the process is robust against environmental fluctuations ?",
    "what is the function of the cell cycle checkpoint from a dynamic view ? here , we address these questions using a simplified cell cycle network model in a budding yeast _",
    "saccharomyces cerevisiae_. we first develop a simplified yeast cell cycle model and select a set of parameters that can qualitatively describe the cell cycle process .",
    "we then apply perturbation methods to analyze the dynamic properties of the local manifold along the evolving cell cycle trajectory .",
    "we demonstrate the following : that the yeast cell cycle process is an excitable system driven by sequential saddle - node bifurcations ; the yeast cell cycle trajectory is globally attractive with modularity in both state space and parameter space ; and that the convergent manifold of the trajectory corresponds to the cell cycle checkpoints . with these advantages ,",
    "the yeast cell cycle process becomes effective and reliable throughout its execution .",
    "the budding yeast cell cycle process is a well - established system for investigating and exploring the control mechanisms of regulatory networks .",

    ", we construct and analyze a coarse - graining model that is mainly based on the abstract architectures and functions of cell cycle and ignored the molecular details .",
    "these simplification approaches have been applied widely to study the design principles of regulatory networks @xcite      the cell cycle process in a budding yeast produces new daughter cells through two major events : dna replication in the s phase and mitosis in the m phase .",
    "we denote this kind of processes that execute different biological functions and events in order and reliably as the sequential - task processes .",
    "the different cyclins and transcription factors ( tf ) control different successive events , and the dna replication checkpoint and spindle assembly and separation checkpoint ensure the stability and hereditary validity of the genetic information @xcite .",
    "the checkpoints ensure the completion of earlier events before the beginning of later events to maintain the orderly progression of the cell cycle @xcite .",
    "based on the cell cycle regulatory network ( figure 3 - 34 in @xcite ) , our previous network with an intra - s and spindle checkpoint @xcite , and the full cell cycle network in the supplemental information ( si ) , we separated the yeast cell cycle regulatory network into the g1/s , early m and late m modules , where the positive and negative feedback loops play an essential role in governing the yeast cell cycle process .",

    "when the cells enter the late s phase that the dna replication task is working , the yeast cell states begin to change slowly and gradually converge to the same point ; this corresponds to the system evolves into the first vertex @xmath150 , there is long duration with decreased velocity and convergent manifold .",
    "similarly , in the early m phase the yeast cell states separate , diverge and change quickly . when the metaphase / anaphase transition with spindle assembly and separation task takes place , where the system near the the second vertex @xmath151 , the yeast cell states should change slowly and converge again .",
    "finally , all the yeast cells should evolve to the stable g1 state @xmath152 waiting for another cell cycle signal . during the whole cell cycle process , from the dna replication event to the mitosis , the dynamic robustness and modularity of the system provide a suitable strategy to execute the sequential events reliably .",
    "so in cell cycle process , the manifolds diverge and converge , wave after wave , cycle in cycle out .",
    "this is the dynamical picture of cell cycle .",

    "for example , when the cell is in a dna replication event , or the dna is damaged in the s phase , the relative pathway is activated and turns on the dna replication checkpoint to keep the cell in the s phase ; only when the damaged dna is repaired or the yeast cell finishes the dna replication event is the dna replication checkpoint turned off and the the yeast cell allowed to enter the g2 and m phases .    to simulate the above cell cycle checkpoint function",
    ", we artificially changed @xmath31 and @xmath32 to represent the on or off states of the cell cycle checkpoints . when the dna replication checkpoint is turned on , @xmath155",
    "; when it is turned off , @xmath156 .",
    "similar to the spindle checkpoint , @xmath157 represents the on state while @xmath158 is the off state .",
    "we denote this as the real or  ideal \" yeast cell cycle trajectory .",
    "the ideal trajectory evolves through the 3 vertex states @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 in order , and the checkpoints not only control the duration of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves , but also separate the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 waves .",
    "furthermore , the checkpoint mechanisms make the kinetic parameters in different waves independent .",
    "this kind of extrinsic checkpoint mechanism in real yeast cell cycle process provides a more stable duration for each phase .",
    "the ideal yeast cell cycle trajectory is globally attractive and stable .",
    "the following discussion provides further evidence for this conclusion . if we were to ignore the activations and repressions among @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 in eq .",
    "[ nondimensionalequ ] as formulated in the model section of this work , there would be 3 fixed points , one on each of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 axis .",
    "thus , @xmath162 , @xmath19 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 are stable nodes , while @xmath20 , @xmath57 , and @xmath165 are unstable saddles .",
    "consider the repression terms @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath11 in eq .",
    "[ nondimensionalequ ] , where only one of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 can be in its maximum state , and @xmath166 is unstable . in this case , only @xmath159 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 are the possible final stable attractors .",
    "when discussing the evolution of the cell cycle engine , andrew murray suggested to make  toy systems \" that are much simpler and mimic the key features of cell cycle process for the deeper understanding of cell cycle@xcite . from the intrinsic checkpoint mechanism in the perfect cell cycle to the outside checkpoint mechanism in real yeast cell cycle process",
    ", our results suggest a possible evolution course of cell cycle network and sequential - task regulatory networks .      in this section",
    "we investigate a counter example , the imperfect yeast cell cycle process , where we set @xmath169 and @xmath170 , and @xmath171 and @xmath172 , all of which are relatively far from the bifurcation points . the imperfect trajectory ( figure  [ wtcellcycle]c and d ) and its local dynamic properties ( figure  [ jacob2 ] ) are quite different from the above perfect yeast cell cycle trajectories . in figure  [ wtcellcycle]c and figure  [ wtcellcycle]d , the maxima of @xmath0 and @xmath1 just reach half of @xmath19 and @xmath58 , there is a relatively large overlap time for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 waves , and there is no sharp pointed end near the 1st and 2nd vertices in phase space .",
    "the duration times of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves are only 1/6 that of the duration times of the perfect cell cycle trajectory .",
    "all of these results show that the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 waves are coupled together . in figure",
    "[ jacob2 ] , one observes that the expansion is less than the perfect trajectory ( @xmath95 ) , even though the local manifold also expands and converges along the trajectory .",
    "near the vertices in the phase map , the manifold can not converge to a narrow state space with a certain evolving velocity ( @xmath105 ) , which then can not provide a long enough duration for dna replication and spindle assembly and separation events .",
    "furthermore , there is no suitable point for the checkpoint mechanism .",
    "the yeast cell cycle process executes dna replication and mitosis in subsequent order , and should be robust against any intrinsic fluctuations and environmental change . in this paper , we constructed and investigated a simplified yeast cell cycle model as a toy model to capture the dynamic essence of sequential - task biological processes .",
    "we have shown that the cell cycle process is an excitable system with global robustness in the state space , and that the phase transitions are driven by dynamic bifurcations containing ghost effects .",
    "these bifurcations and associated ghost effect sufficiently provide the longer durations required for each event or wave , as well as the modularity of the state and parameter spaces .",
    "this cell cycle model is robust and modular in both state and parameter space .",
    "the robustness in state space ensures that the cell cycle process is stable against fluctuations in protein activity .",
    "the modularity and decoupling of the kinetic parameters in the different waves avoids allowing small parameter changes in any one event to influence the general cell cycle process .",
    "our wave transition model provides an efficient and easily controlled strategy for executing the cell cycle processes .",
    "furthermore , our toy cell cycle model suggests a possible synthetic network design for robustly executing other sequential - task processes . in the synthetic network ,",
    "each event can be controlled by the relevant key regulators , and the duration of each event is regulated by the activation strength between successive events ( similar to @xmath9 and @xmath10 in our toy model ) .",
    "these synthetic networks could be used to check our prediction that the long duration and modularity of the sequential - task process is caused and controlled by the ghost effect .",
    "most of the insights we obtained from the toy model are independent of the specific formulation of the model and the number of dimensions , and the sufficient condition is that the dynamic cell cycle models should be governed by sequential saddle - node bifurcations containing ghost effects .",
    "we believe that our results and analysis method are applicable to other eukaryotic cell cycle processes and other sequential - task biological processes .",
    "life is modular in parts and more than the sum of its parts , and this robustness and modularity are the design principles for biological regulatory networks @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if a network behaves along a globally attractive trajectory as well as being modular in state and parameter space , it can execute successive irreversible events more robustly and effectively and thus obtain an evolutionary advantage .",
