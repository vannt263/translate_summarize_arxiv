    "in the exploration of the phase diagram of strong - interaction matter with heavy ions dissipative effects continue to attract large attention . when describing the fireball evolution in viscous hydrodynamics and comparing it to elliptic flow data from rhic , a very small ratio of shear viscosity to entropy - density , @xmath0 , has been inferred @xcite .",
    "similar results have been obtained recently from the alice measurements at the lhc @xcite .",
    "these observations led to the conclusion that strong - interaction matter in the vicinity of the quark - hadron transition behaves almost like a `` perfect fluid '' .",
    "recent hydrodynamical calculations of the elliptic flow @xcite indicate that the @xmath1-dependence of the flow parameter @xmath2 at rhic and lhc energies is rather insensitive to the viscous properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase and the hadronic phase seems to be more important ( fig.[fig.niemi ] ) .",
    "[ fig.niemi ]    this calls for detailed understanding of the temperature evolution of @xmath0 .    at very low temperatures the physics",
    "is dominated by a dilute pion gas whose transport properties are governed by kinetic theory .",
    "the collision term is uniquely specified by the current algebra results for the pion - pion scattering length . as the temperature reaches the chiral restoration transition , however , strong medium modifications of the @xmath3-scattering amplitude are expected due to the softening of the chiral @xmath4-mode . for a quantitative evaluation of these effects qcd - like theories such as the nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model",
    "are well suited .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of this model is the fact that mesons do not exist as elementary degrees of freedom but emerge as composite as quark - antiquarks states . as a consequence ,",
    "the pion , which is a bound state below the chiral restoration temperature , becomes a broad resonance at high temperatures .",
    "when constructing the scattering amplitude for these objects , a controlled approximation scheme has to be used , which is consistent with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and the resulting goldstone theorem .",
    "it is well known that such a scheme is provided by the @xmath5-expansion of the effective action , where in our case @xmath6 can be identified with the number of colors @xmath7 .",
    "before discussing calculations for the @xmath0 ratio for confined matter , let us present a novel form of displaying the phase diagram of qcd matter , matter , where the mean interparticle spacing is of the order of a few femtometers . in this case",
    "the strong interaction is the main player in the equation of state . rather than representing the phase diagram in terms of temperature @xmath8 and baryo - chemical potential @xmath9",
    "we choose to plot pressure vs. temperature .",
    "this has the advantage of a more direct comparison with other substances such as water or liquid helium .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.pd ] .",
    "[ fig.pd ]    the low - temperature regime is the realm of nucleonic matter , which may undergo a first - order chiral restoration transition to chirally ordered and superconducting quark matter at high pressure .",
    "these phases could be realized in the interior of neutron stars . at high temperatures",
    "one encounters quark - gluon matter , whose boundary to the unphysical region ( @xmath10 ) is quantitatively described by lattice qcd and a free pion gas at low @xmath8 .",
    "when raising the temperature the first - order chiral transition line ends in a chiral critical endpoint ( cep ) of second order .",
    "current and future heavy - ion experiments are indicated as well as the chemical freeze out . the latter has been accurately determined from particle ratios using the hadron resonance gas model , for which the pressure can be readily obtained from fits of the freeze - out temperature and chemical potential @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the low - temperature behavior of the shear viscosity can be described in a boltzmann - ueling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) approach in which the time evolution of the one - body phase - space density @xmath11 of a quantum particle , in our case a pion , is given by @xmath12\\ , , \\ ] ] where the two - body collision integral @xmath13 includes the transition matrix @xmath14 for @xmath3-scattering and the phase - space occupancy in the usual way . in the chapman - enskog expansion @xcite for @xmath15",
    "the resulting expression for @xmath16 in a pion gas reads ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the equilibrium distribution and @xmath19 contains @xmath14 .",
    "when evaluating @xmath3-scattering in the two - flavor njl model with the lagrange density @xcite @xmath20,\\ ] ] the lowest nontrivial order is given by the following two diagrams  @xcite :    @xmath21{feynman - pipi - box } } \\quad + \\quad          \\parbox{6ex}{\\includegraphics[height=7ex]{feynman - pipi - tie } }            \\hspace{10 mm } ,   \\label{pipidiagrams}\\ ] ]    where the full lines represent hartree quarks , @xmath22{hartree}}\\quad , \\ ] ] while the double lines denote mesons in the random - phase approximation , @xmath23{rpa}}\\quad .\\ ] ] the resulting `` in - medium '' quark and meson masses are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.masses ] .",
    "we have also indicated two characteristic temperatures  @xcite , which will be important for the later discussion : the `` dissociation temperature '' , @xmath24 , where the @xmath4-meson mass becomes degenerate with the in - medium two - pion threshold as well as at the `` mott temperature '' , @xmath25 , where the pion dissolves into a quark - antiquark pair .    [ fig.masses ]      the scattering lengths in the isospin @xmath26 channel are related to the scattering matrix at threshold as @xmath27 to leading order in the pion mass their vacuum values are entirely dictated by chiral symmetry and have been calculated by weinberg in the 1960s @xcite , @xmath28 while the isospin-1 scattering length vanishes because of the total symmetry of the bosonic wave function .",
    "these values are well reproduced by the njl model when the diagrams ( [ pipidiagrams ] ) are evaluated in vacuum  @xcite . however , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.masses ] , with increasing temperature there are important medium modifications  @xcite .",
    "in particular the softening of the @xmath29-channel @xmath4-meson leads to a sharp peak of @xmath30 at @xmath24 , which is reminiscent to the physics of a feshbach resonance in ultra - cold atomic gases . similarly @xmath30 and @xmath31 diverge at @xmath25 due to threshold singularities of the quark triangle and box diagrams .      in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.coeff ] the shear viscosity is displayed as a function of temperature , using different approximations for the scattering amplitude . in the simplest case ( dash - dotted line ) , both , momentum and temperature dependence are neglected , and @xmath32 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ai ] ) employing the weinberg values ( [ eq : aw ] ) for the scattering lengths .",
    "when the latter are replaced by the temperature dependent njl - model results , we obtain the viscosity indicated by the dotted line .",
    "whereas at low temperature it is in good agreement with the weinberg result , @xmath16 becomes very small in the vicinities of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , because of the large scattering lengths . in these regions , however , kinetic theory breaks down , since the mean interparticle spacing is no longer large compared to the range of the interaction .",
    "moreover , because of thermal motion , the approximation of the momentum dependent scattering amplitude by its value at threshold becomes inappropriate when the temperature increases .",
    "in particular , the pole of the @xmath29-channel @xmath4-meson exchange ( second diagram in ( [ pipidiagrams ] ) ) can be reached at temperatures well below the dissociation temperature , whereas at @xmath33 , when this pole is at threshold , most pion pairs have much higher momenta . as a consequence , the sharp minimum at @xmath33",
    "gets washed out and shifted to lower temperatures when the momentum dependence of the @xmath4-propagator is taken into account ( dashed line ) . for simplicity",
    ", we still neglect the momentum dependence of the quark triangles and boxes in our calculations .",
    "therefore , the steep drop of the viscosity near the mott temperature remains .",
    "another not very realistic feature of this approximation is the fact that the @xmath4-meson is a sharp resonance in random - phase approximation .",
    "this can be remedied by including a @xmath4 width from two - pion decay in the @xmath34-matrix approximation .",
    "one can show that this still fulfills the dilute gas limit , given by the vacuum scattering lengths .",
    "the resulting shear viscosity is given by the full line , which should be considered as the most reliable result of the present study .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath0 and the fluidity measure @xmath35 @xcite , where @xmath36 denotes the enthalpy and @xmath37 the speed of sound , are displayed in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.coeff ] as the dash - dotted and full line , respectively . for the entropy density @xmath29 , the particle density @xmath38 , and the speed of sound @xmath37 we took ideal - gas values , which is consistent with the dilute - gas assumption of the buu approach .",
    "it turns out that both fluidity measures are very similar . after decreasing by several orders of magnitude at low temperatures ,",
    "the curves become rather flat in an intermediate temperature regime , where we find @xmath39 . as already mentioned",
    ", the steep drop near the mott temperature is most likely an artifact of neglecting the momentum dependence of the quark triangles and boxes .",
    "the in - medium @xmath3 cross section has been evaluated in the two - flavor njl model with the aim to include effects of chiral restoration with increasing temperature .",
    "this leads to important modifications of @xmath0 at finite temperature , which render the viscous effects much smaller than it would be expected from a simple vacuum extrapolation . on the other hand ,",
    "the results turn out to be extremely sensitive to the applied approximations , and our `` most reliable '' model is certainly not the last word . in fact , except for the region close to the mott temperature , which should not be trusted , our results are still more than one order of magnitude above the kss bound @xmath40  @xcite . various improvements and extensions of the model should therefore be performed :    in the @xmath3 sector , we should include intermediate @xmath41 mesons , in order to get a realistic description of the @xmath42-wave isovector channel",
    ". we should also include the scattering of other particles , which are suppressed at low temperatures , but can become important in the crossover region .",
    "in particular we wish to extend the model to three flavors and include kaons and @xmath16-mesons . it would also be interesting to include the scattering of quarks , which should become important above the crossover temperature .",
    "work in these directions is in progress ."
