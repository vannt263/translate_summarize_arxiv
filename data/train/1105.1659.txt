    "a ten years epoch of @xmath0ca irradiation of actinide targets for the synthesis of superheavy ( sh ) elements is over .",
    "the heaviest available targets of berkelium ( @xmath1 ) and californium ( @xmath2 ) have been used to produce the elements 117 @xcite and 118 @xcite . note that the predicted cross sections and excitation functions @xcite have been fully confirmed by the experiments performed in dubna and later in berkeley and gsi .",
    "these predictions are based on the shell corrections to the ground states of superheavy nuclei calculated by p.  mller and others @xcite which we used to estimate survival probabilities of these nuclei against fission .",
    "it is the gradual increase of the fission barriers of the compound nuclei ( cn ) formed in these reactions which explains the almost constant value ( of a few picobarns ) of the cross sections for the production of sh elements with @xmath3 in hot fusion reactions .    as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath4cf ( t@xmath5 = 351 yr ) is the heaviest available target that can be used in experiment .",
    "thus , to get sh elements with @xmath6 in fusion reactions , one should proceed to heavier than @xmath0ca projectiles .",
    "the strong dependence of the calculated evaporation residue ( evr ) cross sections for the production of element 120 on the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel @xcite makes the nearest to @xmath0ca projectile , @xmath7ti , most promising for further synthesis of sh nuclei .",
    "of course , the use of the titanium beam instead of @xmath0ca also decreases the yield of sh nuclei mainly due to a worse fusion probability .",
    "the calculated excitation functions for the synthesis of sh elements 119 and 120 in the fusion reactions of @xmath7ti with @xmath4bk and @xmath4cf targets are shown in fig .  [ 120 ] taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "ti+@xmath4bk , @xmath7ti+@xmath4cf and @xmath8cr+@xmath9 cm fusion reactions.[120],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the orientation effects are known to play an important role in fusion reactions of statically deformed heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the fusion probability ( formation of cn ) is strongly suppressed for more elongated nose - to - nose initial orientations . as a result ,",
    "the preferable beam energies for the synthesis of sh elements in the hot fusion reactions are shifted to values that are several mev higher than the corresponding bass barriers ( calculated for spherical nuclei ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ 120 ] , the estimated evr cross sections for the 119 and 120 sh elements synthesized in the @xmath7ti induced fusion reactions are quite reachable at available experimental setups , though one needs much longer time of irradiation than for the @xmath0ca fusion reactions .",
    "the yield of superheavy nuclei ( number of events per day ) depends not only on the cross section but also on the beam intensity and target thickness . in this connection",
    "the other projectile  target combinations should be also considered .",
    "most neutron - rich isotopes of element 120 may be synthesized in the three different fusion reactions @xmath8cr+@xmath9 cm , @xmath10fe+@xmath11pu and @xmath12ni+@xmath13u leading to the same sh nucleus @xmath14 with neutron number near to the predicted closed shell @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these three combinations are not of equal value .",
    "the estimated evr cross sections for more symmetric @xmath10fe+@xmath11pu and @xmath12ni+@xmath13u reactions are lower than those of the less symmetric @xmath8cr+@xmath9 cm combination @xcite , which , in its turn , is quite comparable with the ti - induced fusion reaction , see the right panel of fig .",
    "the advantage factor 2 or 3 for the @xmath7ti+@xmath4bk and @xmath7ti+@xmath4cf fusion reaction as compared with @xmath8cr+@xmath9 cm is definitely within the theoretical uncertainty for calculation of such small cross sections .",
    "such uncertainty originates from two main factors .",
    "first , it is connected with the complex dynamics of cn formation in competition with the dominating quasi - fission process .",
    "there are too few experimental data on low - energy collisions of very heavy ions to fix finally all the parameters ( potential energy , friction forces , nucleon transfer rate ) and to obtain an explicit value for the probability of cn formation for such heavy systems .",
    "the second source of uncertainty comes from the estimation of the survival probability of the excited cn , which is calculated within the statistical model .",
    "the basic quantities here are the fission barriers of sh nuclei appearing in the neutron evaporation chain .",
    "for example , in the 4n evaporation channel one needs to know the fission barriers and neutron separation energies for 5 subsequent isotopes of sh element .",
    "ti+@xmath4bk , @xmath7ti+@xmath4cf and @xmath8cr+@xmath9 cm fusion reactions .",
    "a factor 3 is assumed for the uncertainty of the survival probability caused by the uncertainty of the fission barriers of sh nuclei.[ticr],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    different theoretical models give quite different values for the fission barrier for heavy nuclei .",
    "as mentioned above , we used the fission barriers of sh nuclei predicted by the macro ",
    "microscopic model @xcite , which gives lower fission barriers for the isotopes of elements 119 and 120 than for elements @xmath16 synthesized in @xmath0ca fusion reactions . on the other hand , the full microscopic models based on self - consistent hartree - fock calculations usually predict much higher fission barriers for these isotopes ( up to 10 mev ) if the skyrme forces are used @xcite ( though these predictions are not unambiguous and depend strongly on chosen nucleon - nucleon forces ) .",
    "the exponential dependence of the survival probability on the values of the fission barriers leads to a change of it approximately by a factor 10 if the barriers are changed by 1 mev .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the theoretical uncertainty in the predictions of the cross sections for formation of sh nuclei in hot fusion reactions with actinide targets is not less than a factor 3 .",
    "if we consider such an uncertainty in our calculations , the excitation functions for synthesis of the new sh elements 119 and 120 in 4n evaporation channels of the @xmath7ti+@xmath4bk , @xmath7ti+@xmath4cf and @xmath8cr+@xmath9 cm fusion reactions will look as shown in fig .  [ ticr ] . from this figure",
    "it is clear that all these reactions must be considered as quite promising for the synthesis of new elements .",
    "the final choice between them depends not so much on the difference in the cross sections as on other experimental conditions ( availability of appropriate targets , beam intensities , etc . ) .",
    "note , however , that the present limits for neutron rich isotopes located at the upper part of the nuclear map ( @xmath17 ) are very close to the line of stability while the unexplored area of heavy neutron - rich nuclides ( to the east of the stability line ) is extremely important for nuclear astrophysics investigations and , in particular , for the understanding of the r - process of astrophysical nucleogenesis .",
    "for nuclei with @xmath18 only neutron deficient isotopes ( located to the left of the stability line ) have been synthesized so far , see fig .",
    "[ map_up ] . due to the bending of the stability line to the neutron axis , in fusion reactions of stable nuclei",
    "one may produce only proton rich isotopes of heavy elements ( it s true also for the isotopes of 119 and 120 elements discussed above ) .",
    "this is the main reason for the impossibility of reaching the center of the `` island of stability '' in the superheavy mass region ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) in fusion reactions with stable projectiles . in the @xmath7ti+@xmath4cf and @xmath8cr+@xmath9 cm fusion reactions",
    "the 120-th element can be synthesized with cross sections of about 0.04 and 0.02 pb , correspondingly @xcite , but again only the short - lived neutron deficient isotopes of this element may be obtained .",
    "the use of beams of radioactive nuclei hardly may solve this problem due to their low intensities .",
    "multi - nucleon transfer processes in low - energy collisions of actinide nuclei ( like u+cm ) may really lead to the formation of neutron rich long - living superheavies .",
    "the shell effects ( antisymmetrizing quasi - fission process with a preferable formation of nuclei close to the doubly magic lead isotope ) might significantly enhance the corresponding cross sections @xcite . in spite of difficulties of separation of the transfer reaction products , experiments of such kind are planned to be performed in nearest future .",
    "the neutron capture process is an alternative ( oldest and natural ) method for the production of new heavy elements .",
    "strong neutron fluxes might be provided by nuclear reactors and nuclear explosions under laboratory conditions and by supernova explosions in nature .",
    "however the `` fermium gap '' , consisting of the short lived fermium isotopes @xmath21fm located at the beta stability line while have very short half - lives for spontaneous fission , impedes formation of nuclei with z@xmath22100 by the weak neutron fluxes realized in existing nuclear reactors . in nuclear and supernova explosions ( fast neutron capture ) this gap may be bypassed , if the total neutron fluence is high enough .",
    "theoretical models predict also another region of short lived nuclei located at z=106@xmath23108 and a@xmath24270 ( see fig .",
    "[ maps ] ) .",
    "in this paper we study the possibility of synthesizing heavy elements in multiple `` soft '' nuclear explosions and in pulsed reactors .",
    "we have found that in the first case the both gaps may be easily bypassed and , thus , a measurable amount of the neutron rich long - lived superheavy nuclei of the island of stability may be synthesized .",
    "for the second case we have formulated requirements for the pulsed reactors of the next generation which could be also used for the production of long - lived superheavy nuclei .",
    "the synthesis of heavier nuclei in the reaction of neutron capture with subsequent beta - minus decay is a well studied process ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "relative yields of the isotopes formed in such a process may be found as a solution of the following set of differential equations ( somewhat simplified here )    @xmath25 + n_{z-1,a}\\lambda_{z-1,a}^{\\beta - } + n_{z+2,a+4}\\lambda_{z+2,a+4}^{\\alpha},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the neutron flux ( number of neutrons per square centimeter per second ) and @xmath27 is the decay rate of the nucleus @xmath28 into the channel @xmath29 ( i.e. , beta - minus and alpha decays and fission ) . for simplicity",
    "we ignore here the energy distribution of the neutrons and , thus , the energy dependence of the neutron capture cross section @xmath30 .",
    "neutrons generated by fission in nuclear reactors and in explosions are rather fast ( far from the resonance region ) . in the interval of 0.11  mev",
    "the neutron capture cross section is a smooth function of energy with the value of about 1 barn , which is used below for numerical estimations .",
    "note that integration over the neutron energy may be performed very easily and does not change the obtained conclusions . the simplest version of the reaction chain , where only the neutron capture reactions are retained [ first line in eq.([equation ] ) ] , was considered recently in ref.@xcite .    to solve eq.([equation ] ) numerically one needs to know the decay properties of neutron rich nuclei which are not studied yet .",
    "that is the main problem , which significantly complicates the analysis of the multiple neutron capture processes .",
    "theoretical estimations of half - lives for @xmath31-decay are rather reliable because they depend only on ground state masses which are very close in different theoretical models . for the half - lives of @xmath31-decays we used the well - known viola - seaborg formula with the coefficient proposed by sobiczewski et al .",
    "@xcite half - lives of allowed @xmath32-decays depend also on the ground state masses of the nuclei and may be estimated by the empirical formula @xmath33}= 5.7 $ ] , where the fermi function @xmath34 is calculated by the standard formulas ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the fission half - lives are the most uncertain quantities in eqs.([equation ] ) .",
    "reliable analysis of the fission process requires knowledge of the multidimensional potential energy surface as well as of the collective inertia parameters .",
    "such calculations can be performed only in very restricted areas of the nuclear map .",
    "we used the ground state masses and shell corrections for heavy and superheavy nuclei proposed by p.  mller et al.@xcite",
    "and then we applied the empirical formula for the estimation of the fission half - lives . for this purpose",
    "we employed the relation by swiatecki @xcite based on the idea of the dominant role of the fission barrier for the fission probability @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the fission barrier , which was calculated as a sum of the liquid - drop barrier and the ground - state shell correction .",
    "the coefficients of the systematics ( [ t_sf ] ) were determined by the fitting to the experimental data and to the rather realistic theoretical predictions @xcite for the region of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the results of such calculations are shown in the left part of fig .",
    "[ maps ] , where the theoretical values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and/or @xmath41 were replaced by experimental ones if known . in accordance with our calculations ,",
    "the most stable superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability ( which could be searched for in nature ) are the isotopes of darmstadtium ( @xmath42 ) and/or copernicium ( @xmath43 ) with the neutron number @xmath44 . to produce these nuclei in the neutron capture process one needs to bypass the two area of short - living fissile nuclei ,",
    "namely , the fermium gap ( @xmath45 ) and the region of z=106@xmath23108 and a@xmath24270 .    to test our model we first described available data on the fast neutron capture process realized in nuclear explosions . in this case the time of neutron capture , @xmath46  @xmath47s @xmath48 , is much shorter than half - lives of the produced nuclei ( up to the neutron drip line ) . keeping only the first two terms of the r.h.s . of eq.([equation ] ) , we get the following analytical solution ( with initial conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 at @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of captured neutrons ) @xmath53 this relation can be used for clear understanding of the fast neutron capture process and for a preliminary estimation of relative yields of heavy nuclei synthesized in such a process . here",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath55 is the total neutron fluence ( neutrons per square centimeter ) and @xmath56 is the duration of explosive neutron irradiation .",
    "thus , the dimensionless quantity @xmath54 is a key factor characterizing the neutron capture process . in nuclear explosions the neutron fluence reaches the values of @xmath57  @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 and more than 10 neutrons could be captured during one exposure with time duration of about @xmath60s @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ mike ] the experimental data on the yield of transuranium nuclei in the test thermonuclear explosion `` mike '' @xcite are compared with those calculated by eqs.([equation ] ) assuming @xmath60s neutron exposure of @xmath61  neutrons/@xmath62 with subsequent one - month decay time .",
    "note that elements 99 and 100 ( einsteinium and fermium ) were first discovered just in debris of the `` mike '' explosion .",
    "as can be seen , in this case the fermium gap does not influence the yields of nuclei with @xmath63 which follow roughly the relation ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "recently we proposed to consider the possibility of generating two or several nuclear explosions in close proximity of each other to increase the resulting mass number of the synthesized nuclei@xcite . here",
    "we study for the first time such a possibility illustrated in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ multiple ] . in the bottom part of this figure",
    "the probabilities of heavy element formation are shown for one , three and ten subsequent short - time ( @xmath60s ) neutron exposures of @xmath64  n/@xmath62 each following one after another with time interval of 10 seconds with final one month waiting ( needed to perform some experimental measurements ) .",
    "our results demonstrate for the first time that multiple rather `` soft '' nuclear explosions could be really used for the production of noticeable ( macroscopic ) amount of neutron rich long - lived superheavy nuclei .",
    "leaving aside any discussions on possibilities of such processes and associated technical problems , we want to emphasize a sharp increase of the probability for formation of heavy elements with @xmath65 in the multiple neutron irradiations ( enhancement by several tens of orders of magnitude , see fig .  [ multiple ] ) .",
    "this probability is high enough for some superheavy elements ( see the region above the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ multiple ] ) to perform their experimental identification .",
    "it would be interesting also to study the same process of multiple neutron exposures realized in pulsed nuclear reactors . the pulse duration here could be much longer than in nuclear explosions ( up to few milliseconds ) . in spite of that",
    ", the neutron fluence usually does not exceed @xmath66 n/@xmath62 in existing nuclear reactors ( @xmath67  n/@xmath62s during one millisecond pulse ) .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath54 is about @xmath68 , the time of neutron capture @xmath69  s , and only the nearest long lived isotopes ( a+1 or a+2 ) of irradiated elements may be formed during the pulse , see formula ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "pulse irradiation here corresponds , in fact , to the `` slow '' neutron capture process , in which new elements with larger charge numbers are situated close to the line of stability and finally reach the fermium gap where the process stops ( see fig .",
    "[ maps ] ) .",
    "the result of numerical solution of eq.([equation ] ) for neutron capture process in an ordinary pulsed reactor is shown in fig .",
    "[ reactor ] by the dashed line .",
    "the probability for formation of heavy elements with @xmath63 is negligibly small here independent of a number of pulses and total time of irradiation .",
    "the situation may change if one would be able to increase somehow the intensity of the pulsed reactor .",
    "the neutron fluence in one pulse and frequency of pulses should be high enough to bypass the both gaps of short - lived nuclei on the way to the island of stability ( see left part of fig .  [ maps ] ) .",
    "thus , the specification of the high  intensity pulsed reactors of next generation depends strongly on properties of heavy neutron rich nuclei located to the right of these gaps .",
    "these nuclei are not discovered yet ( see fig .  [ map_up ] ) , and undoubtedly certain experimental efforts should be made to resolve this problem .    using our theoretical estimations for the decay properties of these nuclei ( see above ) we have found that increase of the neutron fluence in the individual pulse by about three orders of magnitude as compared with existing pulsed reactors , i.e. up to 10@xmath70 netrons/@xmath62 , could be quite sufficient to bypass the both gaps ( see the solid curve in fig .  [ reactor ] ) .",
    "the details of the calculations and estimations of the yields of long - lived superheavy nuclei produced in neutron capture processes will be published elsewhere .",
    "we have shown for the first time that a macroscopic amount of the long - living superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability may be really produced in multiple ( rather `` soft '' ) nuclear explosions , if such processes would be realized technically .",
    "this goal could be also reached by using the pulsed nuclear reactors of next generation , if their neutron fluence per pulse will be increased by about three orders of magnitude .",
    "the experimental study of the decay properties of heavy nuclei located along the beta - stability line ( and to the right of it , see fig .",
    "[ map_up ] ) is extremely important for a more accurate analysis of the neutron capture processes ( including the astrophysical ones @xcite ) in the upper part of the nuclear map ."
