    "the release of hipparcos data ( esa , 1997 ) allows to reconsider the luminosity of cp stars of the upper main sequence and their kinematic behaviour on sounder bases . in the present paper the following kinds of cp stars have been considered : he - rich , he - weak , hgmn , si , srcreu and the related group of @xmath1bootis stars .    the lm statistical method ( luri et al . , 1996 ) has been applied to the different samples .",
    "this method has the advantage that all the available astrometric data ( whatever the quality of the parallax is ) as well as radial velocity data are used for each star for the luminosity calibration .",
    "it also provides the kinematic characteristics of the samples .",
    "the method is able to identify and separate groups of stars with different luminosity , kinematic or spatial properties , allowing the treatement of non homogeneous samples .",
    "for bp - ap stars , in order to minimize misclassifications , the samples have been selected using different sources and intercomparing the spectral classifications between them .",
    "first , all the stars in renson s catalogue ( renson , 1991 ) observed by hipparcos were retained .",
    "this first list was cross - correlated with the catalogue of stellar groups of jaschek & egret ( 1981 ) and the michigan catalogues : houk & cowley ( 1975 ) , houk ( 1978 ; 1982 ) and houk & smith - moore ( 1988 ) .",
    "after that , the stars with discrepant spectral classifications were excluded .",
    "the group named si+ contains intermediate types like sicr and sieu . for am stars ,",
    "two samples have been selected from hauck s catalogue ( hauck , 1992 ) : `` normal '' am and `` mild '' am stars .",
    "a star was considered `` mild '' when the difference between the spectral types obtained using metallic lines and the k - line of caii was smaller than 5 subtypes .",
    "table [ tab : ngroups ] gives the number n of stars in the selected samples and the spectral type and effective temperature ranges .",
    "finally , a sample of 41 @xmath1bootis stars , taken from the catalogue of pauzen et al . ( 1997 ) , has also been considered .",
    ".samples of bp - ap and am stars [ cols=\"<,>,<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     secondary groups obtained with the lm method in the samples of hgmn , si and srcreu contain a few high - velocity stars ( in total about 10 ) .",
    "the existence of early - type stars with apparently near solar metallicities and main sequence surface gravities but with high - velocities and/or large distances away from the galactic plane , constitutes a long standing anomaly in the classical picture of stellar galactic populations ( lance , 1991 ) .",
    "several hypotheses have been advanced to explain these objects : ejection from the galactic plane of normal young stars , misclassified stars like blue stragglers ( bs ) or formation as the result of accretion of gas from a merged satellite galaxy . among these mechanisms ,",
    "the second one is very attractive in the case of cp stars because over 60% of the bss observed in young and intermediate age open clusters are found to be peculiar b - a stars ( see stryker ( 1993 ) for details ) .",
    "however , it seems certain that more than one mechanism exists to form high - velocity early - type stars .",
    "mathys et al .",
    "( 1996 ) performed a kinematic study of rapidly oscillating ap stars ( roap ) and found that , on kinematic grounds , these stars are older than the non - oscillating counterparts ( noap ) .",
    "we have 12 roap and 9 noap stars in common with their samples . using these stars ,",
    "the velocity dispersions have been calculated .",
    "we found that both groups have similar kinematic characteristics : @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 values are 25@xmath55kms@xmath6 , 11@xmath52kms@xmath6 , 11@xmath52kms@xmath6 and 21@xmath55kms@xmath6 , 15@xmath54kms@xmath6 , 9@xmath52kms@xmath6 for roap and noap stars , respectively .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows : + - most cp stars are main sequence objects occupying the whole width of the sequence ( about 2 mag ) .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion in absolute magnitude varies from 0.5 to 0.8 mag for all the groups except he - rich stars which spread a large range in luminosities .",
    "some am stars in the secondary groups are out of the main sequence , but before reaching a definitive conclusion it will be necessary to search for possible misclassifications .",
    "+ - from a kinematic point of view , cp stars belong to the disk population younger than 1 - 1.5 gyr .",
    "the velocity field shows the presence of moving groups as observed for normal stars of the same spectral range . in particular , the presence of pleiades , sirius and hyades moving groups has been clearly established .",
    "+ - @xmath1bootis stars are concentrated in the main sequence .",
    "the definition of this type of stars is not well established ( see gerbaldi , these proceedings ) .",
    "their evolutionary status remains controversial , but the kinematic characteristics correspond to those of non - peculiar stars of the same spectral range .",
    "+ - roap and noap stars show similar kinematic characteristics ."
