    "the neutrino signal from the next core - collapse supernova in our galaxy will give us an unprecedented opportunity to peer into the heart of an exploding star and confront our current paradigm of how these stars explode with observations .",
    "but decoding the message will be no easy task because the neutrino signal will have experienced so many flavor - changing events on the trip from proto - neutron star to our detectors that scramble the information , see for example kneller , mclaughlin & brockman @xcite and lund & kneller @xcite .",
    "the first flavor changing effect the signal experiences is due to neutrino self interactions / collective effects in the region up to @xmath5 above the proto neutron star @xcite followed by the mikheyev , smirnov & wolfenstein ( msw ) effect which is complicated in supernovae by the impression of the shockwave racing through the stellar mantle @xcite .",
    "turbulence in the mantle , seeded during the earlier neutrino heating / standing accretion shock instability phase @xcite , also needs to be included usually by modelling @xcite . finally , there is the possibility of earth matter effects leaving an imprint in the signal though a recent study expects this effect to be minimal @xcite .",
    "what makes decoding the signal even more of a challenge is that the neutrinos we receive at a given instant and with a given energy will not have experienced the same flavor evolutionary history .",
    "the neutrinos arriving at a detector will have been emitted from different locations at the source and both the neutrino collective and the msw+turbulence effects will vary from trajectory to trajectory . starting with duan _",
    "@xcite , the self interaction effects in calculations where the neutrino emission over the source is assumed to be spherically symmetric have been seen to be ` angle dependent ' in the sense that a neutrino following a pure radial trajectory differs from one emitted at an angle relative to the normal . presumably allowing for aspherical source emission would only make the trajectory dependence even stronger .",
    "similarly the msw plus turbulence effects are also trajectory dependent .",
    "if we temporarily cast aside the turbulence and focus on the gross structure of the explosion i.e.   the lowest angular multipole moments , an aspherical passage of the shock through the star , by itself , leads to a line - of - sight dependence .",
    "but , one must recall that we will not observe the neutrinos from a supernova at widely different lines of sight , all our detectors are here on earth .",
    "the size of the source is of order the proto - neutron star radius , i.e.   @xmath6 while the shock effects show up in the signal when the shock has propagated out to @xmath7 .",
    "as long as the curvature of the shock is over a lengthscale greater than the source size the neutrinos which appear in our detectors will all have seen essentially the same profile .",
    "when one re - inserts the turbulence into the profile , one realizes this approximation may no longer be valid because turbulence extends to much smaller lengthscales even when the shock is far out in the stellar mantle .",
    "the density profile along two , essentially parallel lines of sight to a distant detector separated by @xmath6 will no longer be negligibly dissimilar and one must consider how the dissimilarity of the profiles propagates to the neutrinos .",
    "any correlation will lead to a potential new feature of the neutrino signal .",
    "it has been shown that the transition probabilities for a single neutrino - the set of probabilities that relates the initial state to the state after passing through the supernova - is not unique when turbulence is inserted into a profile : it will depend upon the exact turbulence pattern seen by the neutrino as it travelled through the supernova @xcite . those transition probabilities are drawn from distributions whose properties will depend upon the stage of the explosion , the character of the turbulence , and the neutrino energy and mixing parameters . if the coherence of two neutrinos emitted at the same time and with the same energy but from different locations is small then the final states are uncorrelated and one would expect that the flux at a detector would just be the mean of whatever distribution describes the transition probabilities multiplied by the initial spectra .",
    "but if the coherence is high then all the neutrinos will have the same set of transition probabilities which one might expect to ` scintillate ' together as the turbulence evolves .",
    "of course , this ignores the issue of energy resolution and temporal binning of the signal that becomes necessary because of the limited statistics .    the purpose of this paper is to consider the issue of finite source size and the correlation of the neutrino transition probabilities along parallel trajectories through turbulent supernova profiles .",
    "our calculations expand upon the work of kneller & volpe @xcite and kneller & mauney @xcite upon which we rely heavily for the techniques used to calculate the turbulence effects and as context for our results .",
    "we begin by describing the calculations we undertook paying particular attention to the construction of the random fields used to model the turbulence .",
    "the basic approach to determining the effects of turbulence are then demonstrated , followed by the computation of the transition probability correlation as a function of the separation between the emission points .",
    "we finish by summarizing our findings and discuss the implications for the galactic neutrino burst signal .",
    "the neutrino transition probabilities are the set of probabilities of measuring some neutrino state @xmath8 given an initial neutrino state @xmath9 i.e   @xmath10",
    ". we shall denote antineutrino transition probabilities by @xmath11 .",
    "if the @xmath12-matrix relating the initial and final wavefunctions is known then these probabilities are just the square amplitudes of the elements of @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath12-matrix is calculated from the schrodinger equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian is the sum of the vacuum contribution @xmath15 and the msw potential @xmath16 which describes the effect of matter .",
    "the vacuum hamiltonian is diagonal in what is known as the ` mass ' basis and in this basis @xmath17 is defined by two mass squared differences @xmath18 and the neutrino energy @xmath19 .",
    "the mass basis is related to the flavor basis by the maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo @xcite unitary matrix @xmath20 .",
    "the most common parametrization of @xmath20 is in terms of three mixing angles , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , a cp phase and two majoranna phases .",
    "the msw potential @xmath16 is diagonal in the flavor basis because matter interacts with neutrinos based on their flavor .",
    "the neutral current interaction leads to a contribution to @xmath16 which is common to all flavors .",
    "this may be omitted because it leads only to a global phase which is unobservable .",
    "the charged current potential only affects the electron flavor neutrino and antineutrinos and is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fermi constant and @xmath26 the electron density .    in matter the two contributions to @xmath14 means neither the mass nor the flavor states diagonalize the matrix .",
    "but there is a basis known as the matter basis which does diagonalize @xmath14 i.e.  for a given value of the electron density there is a matrix @xmath27 such that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues .",
    "when the msw potential vanishes the matter basis becomes the mass basis up to arbitrary phases .",
    "the matter basis is the most useful for studying the evolution of neutrinos through matter because it removes the trivial adiabatic msw transition and it will be the basis we use to report our results in this paper .",
    "we refer the reader to kneller & mclaughlin @xcite and galais , kneller & volpe @xcite for a more detailed description of the matter basis .",
    "neutrino with mixing angle @xmath30 and mass splitting @xmath31 [ fig : profile ] ]    we now turn our attention to the turbulent density profiles through which we shall send our neutrinos . as usual , we shall model the turbulence by multiplying a turbulence free density profile by a gaussian random field .",
    "since the spatial extent of the neutrino emission , of order @xmath32 , is much smaller than the radial location of the turbulence , of order @xmath33 , we shall ignore any curvature of the density profile features and use a plane - parallel model for the supernova .",
    "the z axis of our cartesian co - ordinate system is aligned with the radial direction of the profile .",
    "the profile we adopt is from a one - dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of a supernova taken from kneller , mclaughlin & brockman @xcite .",
    "this profile is shown in figure ( [ fig : profile ] ) and is the same one used in kneller & mauney @xcite .",
    "the figure shows the presence of two shocks : the forward shock at @xmath34 and the reverse shock at @xmath35 . in multi - dimensional simulations of supernova",
    "both these shock fronts are aspherical and fluid flow through the distorted shocks leads to strong turbulence in the region between them .",
    "our selection of this profile also determines the neutrino energy we shall use since we wish the neutrinos to have an h resonance density that does not intersect the shocks",
    ". therefore we pick @xmath36 for the neutrino energy and the reader may observe that the two - flavor resonance density for a @xmath36 , shown in the figure , does not intersect the shocks as required .",
    "the turbulence is inserted by multiplying the profile in the region between the reverse and forward shocks by a factor @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a three - dimensional gaussian random field with zero mean . the random field",
    "is represented by a fourier series , that is @xmath39 in this equation the parameter @xmath40 sets the amplitude of the fluctuations while the two @xmath41 functions are included to suppress fluctuations close to the shocks and prevent discontinuities .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 is a damping scale which we set to @xmath43 .",
    "the random part of @xmath44 appears in the the second half of equation ( [ eq : f3d ] ) because the set of co - efficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 are independent standard gaussian random variates with zero mean .",
    "the @xmath47 are a set of wavenumbers and , finally , the paramaters @xmath48 are k - space volume co - efficients .",
    "the method of fixing the @xmath49 @xmath50 s , @xmath16 s , @xmath51 s and @xmath52 s for a realization of @xmath44 is ` variant c ' of the randomization method described in kramer , kurbanmuradov , & sabelfeld @xcite which we have generalized to three dimensions . the randomization method in general partitions the space of wavenumbers into @xmath53 regions and from each we select a random wavevector using the power - spectrum , @xmath54 , as a probability distribution .",
    "the volume paramaters @xmath48 are the integrals of the power spectrum over each partition if the power spectrum is normalized to unity .",
    "variant c of the randomization method divides the k - space so that the number of partitions per decade is uniform over @xmath55 decades starting from a cutoff scale @xmath4 .",
    "throughtout this paper we shall use a wavenumber cutoff @xmath4 set to twice the distance between the shocks i.e.   @xmath56 .",
    "the logarithmic distribution of the modes increases the efficiency of the algorithm in the sense that we can use a ` small ' value of @xmath49 and also the agreement between the exact statistical behavior of the field and that of an ensemble of realizations is uniform over some range of lengthscales i.e.   it is scale invariant .",
    "this feature is important for our study because the oscillation wavelength of the neutrinos is constantly changing as the density evolves .",
    "the minimum lengthscale we need to cover has been shown by friedland & gruzinov @xcite and kneller , mclaughlin & patton @xcite to be the reduced oscillation wavelengths for the neutrinos and antineutrinos i.e.   @xmath57 and @xmath58 - where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the differences between the eigenvalues @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the neutrinos and antineutrinos respectively .",
    "kneller & mauney @xcite showed the wavelengths in the turbulence region were of order @xmath63 or greater which is approximately four orders of magnitude smaller than the shock separation .",
    "this means we need to pick @xmath64 to cover the necessary decades in k - space .",
    "the final component of our calculations we have yet to discuss is the power spectrum @xmath54 . in this paper",
    "we shall consider two power spectra and our first choice , due to its simplicity , is a normalized three - dimensional , isotropic inverse power - law spectrum given by @xmath65 for @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the magnitude of the wavevector @xmath68 . throughout this paper",
    "we shall adopt the kolmogorov spectrum where @xmath69 .",
    "the one dimensional power spectrum for the @xmath70 component of the wavevector is @xmath71 which differs from the one dimensional power spectrum used by kneller & mauney @xcite because for @xmath72 the power is suppressed by the factor @xmath73 and the one dimensional spectrum is non - zero for @xmath74 .",
    "the two - point correlation function @xmath75 for this choice of a power spectrum depends only the magnitude of the separation , @xmath76 , and may be calculated analytically to be    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "there is one last quantity to determine : the number of @xmath49 of elements in the sets of random wavenumbers , coefficients and volumes . to find this quantity we compare the statistical properties of an ensemble of random field realizations with the exact expressions as a function of the ratio @xmath79 for a given @xmath55 .",
    "the statistical property we compute is the second order structure function @xmath80 which is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the separation between two points .",
    "the function @xmath83 is related to the two - point correlation function @xmath84 via @xmath85 . for the isotropic power spectrum both @xmath86 and @xmath52",
    "are only functions of the magnitude of @xmath82 and the correlation function is given above .",
    "as a function of @xmath87 for two randomly orientated points in a 3-d homogeneous and isotropic gaussian random field to the exact structure function . the two curves in the figure correspond to @xmath88 ( blue solid ) and @xmath89 .",
    "at every @xmath87 we generated @xmath90 realization of the field and the error bar on each point is the standard deviation of the mean @xmath91 .. [ fig : grf3diso ] ]    in figure ( [ fig : grf3diso ] ) we show the ratio @xmath92 of the numerically calculated structure function for the isotropic random field to the exact solution as a function of the scale @xmath93 when we use either @xmath94 wavenumbers spread over @xmath95 decades or @xmath96 wavenumbers over @xmath97 decades .",
    "the numerical calculation is the average of @xmath90 realizations of the turbulence and the error bar on each point is the error on the sample mean .",
    "the figure indicates that the method we use to generate random field realizations reproduces the analytic results for the structure function very well and with high efficiency because good agreement between the statistics of the ensemble and the exact result requires just @xmath98 .",
    "in fact we find even @xmath99 ratios of just @xmath100 are sufficient to give acceptable agreement but we re - assure the reader we shall stick with @xmath98 .",
    "but isotropic and homogeneous three - dimensional turbulence is perhaps not a realistic scenario for supernova because the gravitational potential and the general fluid flow are in the radial direction . only on sufficiently small scales",
    "should the turbulence become isotropic .",
    "this division into large and small lengthscales indicates we should partion the power - spectrum so that for @xmath101 the spectrum is isotropic , where @xmath102 is the isotropy scale , between @xmath103 the spectrum is anisotropic and then below the cutoff scale , @xmath74 , the power spectrum should be set to zero since there should be no modes on scales larger than @xmath104 . for @xmath105 where the spectrum is isotropic we use a power spectrum resembling equation ( [ eq : iostropicps ] ) @xmath106 note the additional factor of @xmath107 in the numerator .",
    "for @xmath108 we write the spectrum as the product @xmath109 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath110 is chosen to be a continuation of the inverse power - law given above while the spectrum in the xy directions , @xmath111 , is the spectrum of the isotropic / homogeneous region in these directions fixed at @xmath112 . the spectrum for @xmath108 is thus @xmath113 the reader may verify the power spectrum defined by equations ( [ eq : psb ] ) and ( [ eq : psa ] ) is normalized .",
    "this anisotropic three - dimensional power spectrum yields a one - dimensional spectrum along the z direction given by @xmath114 for @xmath115 which is exactly the same as the one - dimensional spectrum used in kneller & mauney @xcite . there is no analytic formula for the two - point structure function for _ randomly _ orientated separations using this power spectrum but if we consider the two - point structure function of the random field for points orientated along the z direction then we can compute that in this direction    @xmath116    compared to the isotropic spectrum above , this anisotropic spectrum differs in important ways .",
    "first , even if we set @xmath117 we observe that the lack of power in the region @xmath74 means we have to compensate by increasing the structure / decreasing the correlation by the factor @xmath107 .",
    "this increase is the reason for the appearance of the extra factor @xmath107 in equation ( [ eq : psb ] ) .",
    "next , as we increase the ratio @xmath118 , we push more and more of the structure of the field in the xy direction to ever smaller scales reducing even further the correlation of the field at some fixed non - radial separation @xmath0 compared to the isotropic case .     as a function of @xmath119 for two points aligned along the @xmath120 direction to the structure function @xmath121 of two points aligned along the @xmath122 direction at @xmath123 .",
    "the three curves in the figure correspond to @xmath124 ( solid ) , @xmath125 ( dashed ) and @xmath126 ( dot - dashed ) . at every @xmath119 we generated @xmath90 realization of the field and the error bar on each point is the standard deviation of @xmath127 .",
    "the structure function @xmath121 was computed using the correlation function given in ( [ eq : zcorrelation ] ) and the relationship @xmath128 .",
    "the inputs to the random field generator were @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "[ fig : grf3daniso ] ]    this extra power at small scales can be seen in figure ( [ fig : grf3daniso ] ) which is a plot of the ratio of the one - dimensional two - point structure function in the x direction relative to the structure function along the z direction at the same separation scale for three values of @xmath129 . as promised ,",
    "when @xmath130 there is an equal amount of structure in the field along both radial and non - radial directions but as @xmath129 increases we push more and more of the structure of the field in the xy direction to smaller scales .",
    "the anisotropic power spectrum we have constructed means the turbulence along different parallel rays is less correlated than the turbulence along two rays at the same separation when the power spectrum is isotropic .",
    "if that s the case then the transition probabilities for the neutrinos travelling along those two rays should also be less correlated and below we quantify the decrease .",
    "now that we have the random fields to model the turbulence we are all set to generate turbulent profiles and send neutrinos and antineutrinos through them . to achieve higher efficiency we follow six neutrinos and six antineutrinos simultaneously through every realization of the turbulence with one neutrino and one antineutrino emitted at @xmath131 .",
    "each time we generate a new realization we end up with a different set of transition probabilities so by repeating the calculation many times - in our case a minimum of one thousand times but often much larger - we can create an ensemble of transition probabilities of size @xmath132 from each emission point .",
    "once we have our ensemble we can then go ahead and compute means @xmath133 , variances @xmath134 , and , of course , correlations @xmath135 the correlation of the antineutrino transition probabilities will be denoted as @xmath136 . in the large n",
    "limit the error on the correlation is expected to be @xmath137 . combining the results from the six emission points we can form fifteen separations @xmath0 so fifteen correlations but two points must be remembered : first , groups of them will cluster e.g.  we will have a value for the correlation at @xmath138 but also two more at @xmath139 and @xmath140 and second , these groups of transition probability correlations are themselves correlated - half the data in each correlation value is the same for all members of the cluster .",
    "nevertheless these clusters are useful because they serve as a consistency check - we should expect the results to be similar within each cluster - and also they give us an indication if the error in the results are comparable to the expected , large - n error @xmath141 given above .",
    "we also need to specify the neutrino mixing parameters we have used .",
    "the hierarchy will be set to normal and we shall comment on how our results translate to the inverted hierarchy .",
    "as discussed , the neutrino energy will be fixed at @xmath142 , typical of supernova neutrino energies and we shall set the neutrino mixing parameters to be @xmath143ev@xmath144 , @xmath145ev@xmath144 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147",
    ". the recent measurements of the last mixing angle @xmath22 by t2k @xcite , double chooz @xcite , reno @xcite and daya bay @xcite are all in the region of @xmath148 .",
    "we shall adopt this value for the majority of this paper but this result is sufficiently new that we shall show on occasion results with multiple values of @xmath22 in order to put this result in context .",
    "finally , the turbulence amplitude @xmath40 will be allowed to vary but we shall focus upon larger values . with the measurement of a large value of @xmath22 the turbulence effects are negligible for amplitudes of order @xmath149 @xcite .     for each of the neutrino emission points @xmath120 . from bottom to top",
    "the emission points are @xmath150 .",
    "the turbulence amplitude is set to @xmath151 , we used @xmath152 , @xmath95 for the 3-d turbulence field generator , and the neutrino mixing parameters used are those given in the text with @xmath153 .",
    "[ fig : f(p23 ) ] ]     ( circles ) , @xmath154 ( squares ) and @xmath155 ( triangles ) of the neutrinos emitted at @xmath156 as a function of the parameter @xmath53 keeping the ratio @xmath157 fixed at @xmath158 .",
    "the error bars are not the error on the mean but rather the standard deviation of the samples .",
    "the turbulence amplitude is set to @xmath151 and @xmath153[fig : meanp23vsnk ] ]      before we show our results for the correlation of the transition probabilities as a function of the emission separation , we consider first the statistical properties of the ensembles for each emission point .",
    "in addition to being interesting in their own right and useful as a reference , these calculations allow us to test that our 3d random field generator is working properly because the ensembles for each point of emission should be consistent and independent of @xmath120 .    in figure ( [ fig : f(p23 ) ] ) we show the frequency distribution of @xmath154 for the six emission locations @xmath120 using the mixing paramaters given above , @xmath159 , @xmath152 , @xmath95 and @xmath160 and the isotropic power spectrum .",
    "the sample size is @xmath161 for each emission point . in each panel of the figure the reader will observe that the transition probability is almost uniformly distributed - there is a slight decrease in the frequency of higher values of @xmath154 - but , more importantly , there is no observed trend with @xmath120",
    ". a closer inspection of figure ( [ fig : f(p23 ) ] ) also hints at some correlation : the bottom few panels of the figure are very similar .",
    "we have reproduced this calculation for other choices of the @xmath53 and @xmath55 paramaters .",
    "the results are shown in figure ( [ fig : meanp23vsnk ] ) where we plot the mean values and standard deviations of @xmath162 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 for ensembles of neutrinos emitted at @xmath156 as a function of the parameter @xmath53 keeping the ratio @xmath79 fixed at @xmath163 .",
    "there is no discernable trend with @xmath49 and we march on confident that setting @xmath152 and @xmath95 does not bias our results .",
    "we now allow the values of @xmath40 and @xmath22 to float and consider both the isotropic and anisotropic power spectrum .",
    "the evolution of the transition probability means as a function of @xmath40 for the two power spectra and two choices of @xmath22 are shown in figure ( [ fig : meansvscstar ] ) .",
    "there are many interesting trends discussed in detail in kneller & mauney @xcite .",
    "large amplitude turbulence works its way through to affect every mixing channel , not just the h resonance channel @xmath154 , as promised so that by @xmath164 we observe @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 . to put this in context , in the absence of turbulence all these transition probabilities are zero when @xmath171 .",
    "the only _ neutrino _ mixing channel with reasonable sensitivity to @xmath22 is the h resonance channel @xmath154 and even then the disparity in @xmath172 at @xmath173 disappears by @xmath174 .",
    "in contrast the _ antineutrinos _ are very sensitive to @xmath22 even at large turbulence amplitudes : the expectation value for @xmath175 varies by a factor of @xmath176 when @xmath22 is changed from @xmath177 to @xmath153 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 on the other hand change by @xmath180 orders of magnitude between the same limits .",
    "while these trends are interesting , the purpose of figure ( [ fig : meansvscstar ] ) is to compare the use of the isotropic and anisotropic power spectra .",
    "except for the h resonance mixing channel @xmath154 , the isotropic power spectrum gives values of @xmath181 which are smaller than the anisotropic spectrum .",
    "the neutrinos are more sensitive to the turbulence when the power spectrum is anisotropic because the neutrinos are sensitive to the amplitude of the turbulence modes of order the neutrino oscillation wavelength @xcite which is typically in the range of @xmath182 in the h resonance region .",
    "the anisotropic spectrum removed all power for the fluctuations in the radial direction at the long wavelengths above @xmath104 - which is of order @xmath183 in our calculation - and to compensate we needed to increase the power on the smaller wavelengths which means and effective increase of their amplitude .",
    "in fact we already know the exact amount the amplitude is effectively increased because we pointed out the @xmath73 factor that appears in the one dimensional power spectrum in the isotropic case compared to the one - dimensional spectrum derived from the anisotropic turbulence .",
    "thankfully , our expectations are confirmed by figure ( [ fig : meansvscstar ] ) because the increase of all the mixing channels except @xmath154 is on the expected scale of @xmath107 .",
    "the isotropy scale paramater @xmath3 , which sets the scale in the radial direction below which the turbulence is isotropic , does not play a role for these point source statistics .",
    "the one - dimensional power spectrum along the radial direction is independent of the isotropy scale @xmath3 which can be seen when comparing equations ( [ eq:1diostropicps ] ) and ( [ eq:1daniostropicps ] ) .",
    "so if the one - dimensional power spectrum is independent of @xmath3 then the effect of switching the power spectrum from isotropic to anisotropic is solely due to the removal of radial long - wavelength fluctuations .",
    "the transition probability @xmath154 behaves slightly differently but is entirely consistent with the understanding of the effects in the other channels . at smaller amplitudes and the smaller value of @xmath22",
    "there is no effect of the power spectrum switch upon @xmath184 because the depolarization limit has been reached . at the larger mixing angle depolarization",
    "has not achieved and switching the power spectrum leads to the effects as seen in @xmath185 and @xmath175 .",
    "the two - flavor depolarization limit is reached for the @xmath153 case when @xmath186 . at around this same turbulence amplitude",
    "there begins the shift to three - flavor depolarization where @xmath187 . whatever the mixing angle used , we see that the mean value @xmath188 as a function of @xmath40 using the anisotropic spectrum begins the transition at smaller @xmath40 than the same calculation using the isotropic spectrum because of the increased amplitude of the small scale fluctuations in the former case .",
    "we now turn to the correlation of the transition probabilities as a function of the distance between the emission points and consider first the case of the isotropic power spectrum .",
    "our result for the correlation of the transition probabilities , except @xmath179 , as a function of the separation @xmath0 at various values of @xmath22 and turbulence amplitudes @xmath40 is shown in figure ( [ fig : rhovscstar ] ) .",
    "@xmath179 is excluded is because it is difficult to calculate its correlation reliably .",
    "what one notices immediately about the results are that @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 all show little sensitivity to either @xmath22 or @xmath40 - which is in contrast to figure ( [ fig : meansvscstar ] ) .",
    "the reason for the lack of sensitivity of these correlations to @xmath22 and @xmath40 is explained by the exponential distributions these transition probabilities possess .",
    "both the turbulence amplitude and the mixing angle simply ` rescale ' the ensemble of transition probabilities and , as equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) shows , this rescaling can not alter the correlation .",
    "one also sees that the correlation of all these transition probabilities is high , @xmath193 , for all separations @xmath194 .",
    "in contrast the correlation of @xmath154 is sensitive to both @xmath22 and @xmath40 .",
    "when @xmath40 is of order @xmath2 the sensitivity to @xmath22 arises because the distributions of @xmath154 at the different mixing angle choices are very different : for @xmath177 the distribution is uniform , for @xmath153 it is strongly skewed to small values of @xmath154 .",
    "as @xmath40 increases the sensitivity disappears because the distributions at each value of @xmath22 become similar : this is the same behavior seen in figure ( [ fig : meansvscstar ] ) .",

    "[ fig : rho12,rho13,rho23aniso0.3 ] ]        the change to the mean point source transition probabilities when switching to an anisotropic power spectrum is both understandable and measurable but , overall , the effects are small and of the order of factors of @xmath107 i.e.   the amplitude by which the small scale fluctuations in the anisotropic spectrum increased in amplitude compared to the isotropic spectrum .",
    "that insensitivity no longer holds when we examine the correlations of the transition probabilities because these quantities are functions of the isotropy scale paramater @xmath3 .",
    "the correlations of the transition probabilities as a function of the separation between the emission points is strongly sensitive to the amount of turbulence power in the perpendicular directions and increasing @xmath3 relative to the fixed scale @xmath4 shifts the power from long wavelength , small @xmath204 and @xmath205 , to much shorter wavelengths , as shown in figure ( [ fig : grf3daniso ] ) .",

    "the difference between the isotropic and anisotropic power spectra are minimal but at larger ratios of the two scales the correlation at some given separation @xmath0 drops noticeably in all three channels though the reduction in the correlation of @xmath185 and @xmath175 is not as severe as that for the transition probability @xmath154 .",

    "the correlation at @xmath207 is already small for this mixing angle and turbulence amplitude even in the isotropic and @xmath201 cases so pushing more power of the fluctuations in perpendicular directions to smaller wavelengths completely removes the correlation of @xmath154 over the proto - neutron star radial scale .",
    "if we now vary the turbulence amplitude we generate figure ( [ fig : rho12,rho13,rho23aniso9 ] ) which is , again , for a mixing angle of @xmath153 . examining the results",

    "supernova turbulence and its effects upon both the flavor composition of neutrinos that pass through it and their correlations depend upon many numerous parameters one needs to introduce to describe the turbulence .",
    "all affect the result and here we try to succinctly summarize our results . for a neutrino energy of @xmath36 and using a supernova density profile taken from a simulation @xmath210 post - bounce , we find in a normal hierarchy that the correlation of the h resonance mixing channel transition probability @xmath154 as a function of the emission separation @xmath0 drops considerably as @xmath40 increases for both the cases of isotropic and anisotropic turbulence .",
    "if the turbulence amplitude is of order @xmath173 then the correlation of the transition probability @xmath154 for neutrinos emitted from opposite sides of the proto - neutron star , i.e.   separated by @xmath6 , is marginal for the isotropic spectrum and for the anisotropic only when @xmath211 .",
    "for @xmath198 there is essentially no correlation of the h resonance transition probabilities for neutrinos emitted from opposite sides of the proto - neutron star . at these amplitudes",
    "the turbulence along parallel trajectories separated by @xmath6 is just too different to permit any correlation of this transition probability in the supernova neutrino burst signal .",
    "if we switch to an inverted hierarchy then it will be the transition probability @xmath178 which behaves this way .",
    "in contrast , the correlation of the transition probabilities @xmath185 , @xmath175 , @xmath212 and @xmath178 in a normal hierarchy as a function of emission separation is largely independent of @xmath40 and @xmath22 .",
    "the correlation decreases as the ratio @xmath118 increases but remains significant for separations of order the proto - neutron star radius even for @xmath213 . when switching to an inverted hierarchy the mixing channels which behave this way are @xmath185 , @xmath154 , @xmath212 and @xmath179 .",
    "these mixing channels , particularly @xmath185 and @xmath212 , are the most promising for observing flavor scintillation assuming the energy resolution of our neutrino detectors does not wash out the effect and the temporal correlation remains high .",

    "<S> the transition probabilities describing the evolution of a neutrino with a given energy along some ray through a turbulent supernova are random variates unique to each ray . </S>",

    "<S> we find that if we use an isotropic power spectrum for the random field , the correlation of the high ( h ) density resonance mixing channel transition probability is significant , greater than 0.5 , for emission separations of @xmath1 , typical of proto neutron star radii , only when the turbulence amplitude is less than @xmath2 ; at larger amplitudes the correlation in this channel drops close to zero for this same separation of @xmath1 . in contrast , there is significant correlation in the low ( l ) density resonant and non - resonant channels even for turbulence amplitudes as high as 50% . switching to anisotropic spectra requires the introduction of an ` isotropy ' parameter @xmath3 whose inverse defines the scale below which the field is isotropic . </S>",

    "<S> the spectral features in the h resonance mixing channel of the next galactic supernova neutrino burst may be strongly obscured by large amplitude turbulence when it enters the signal due to the finite size of the source while the presence of features in the l and non resonant mixing channels may persist , the exact amount depending upon the degree of anisotropy of the turbulence . </S>"
