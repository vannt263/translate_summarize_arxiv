    "the variationally improved or optimized perturbation ( opt ) is by now a rather well - used modification of standard perturbation theory ( for a far from complete list of early references , see _ e.g. _",
    "it is based on a reorganization of the interacting lagrangian such that it depends on an arbitrary ( mass ) parameter ( so - called linear @xmath2 expansion ( lde ) in its simplest form ) , to be fixed by a definite optimization prescription , but it has many other variants  @xcite . in @xmath3 theories , such as",
    "the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator  @xcite , described by a scalar @xmath4 field theory , the lde turns out to be very similar  @xcite to the  order - dependent mapping \" ( odm ) resummation method  @xcite , being equivalent at large orders to a rescaling of the adjustable oscillator mass with perturbative order , which can suppress the factorial large - order behaviour of ordinary perturbative coefficients .",
    "this appropriate rescaling of the adjustable mass gives a convergent series  @xcite _ e.g. _ for the oscillator energy levels  @xcite and related quantities .",
    "for the oscillator field theory , no renormalization is needed , moreover the ( ordinary ) perturbative series is known to arbitrary high orders , and the known large order behaviour of the series is a crucial guide both numerically and analytically to establish such convergence properties . in contrast , for most @xmath5 models , things become more involved due to the necessary renormalization , but the opt procedure can be made fully consistent  @xcite with the renormalization program of ordinary perturbation theory , at least in a minimal subtraction scheme .",
    "accordingly , the prescription is well - defined on renormalized lagrangians with appropriate counterterms .",
    "it is such that any physical quantity whose ordinary renormalized perturbative series is available can then be evaluated to order @xmath6 using well - defined modified feynman rules .",
    "however in most @xmath5 renormalizable models the perturbative series is only available for a few first orders , such that one can hardly study convergence properties of the opt method .",
    "nevertheless it gives at least a well - defined systematically improvable way to go beyond mean field approximation and has a wide range of applicability , also at finite temperature and density .",
    "to quote just a few examples of successful applications , for instance the occurence and precise location of a tricritical point and mixed liquid - gas phase within the gn model  @xcite in @xmath7 dimensions  @xcite have been obtained , that was hinted at by monte - carlo simulations  @xcite but completely missed by the mean field approximation .",
    "opt has also been used very recently  @xcite in the non - renormalizable @xmath8 nambu - jona - lasino model  @xcite to study the phase transitions beyond mean field approximation in this simplified picture of low - energy qcd . in a different context",
    ", results for the shift of the critical temperature due to interactions in the bose - einstein condensate have been obtained  @xcite , with some results  @xcite in remarkable agreement with precise results from monte - carlo lattice simulations  @xcite . in this latter case",
    "the relevant field model is the three - dimensional super - renormalizable @xmath9 @xmath10 model  @xcite , which somewhat simplifies renormalization issues , and the perturbative series is known to high ( seventh ) order , which also allows some definite conclusions on convergence properties@xcite .",
    "+ now , in a more general renormalizable theory , once the renormalization procedure is well - defined , it is highly desirable to examine how the renormalization group ( rg ) invariance of the full theory is realized within this optimized perturbation .",
    "more practically , it is also of interest to examine how to incorporate eventually more information on higher orders from the rg within the calculated quantities .",
    "however in order to keep the rg resummation full information within the delta - expansion , it turns out that one has to resum to _ all _ orders in the latter expansion .",
    "this can be done  @xcite , at the same level of approximation than rg is treated ( _ i.e. _ typically for the leading , next - to - leading , etc  logarithmic dependence on the mass parameter ) , but implying a rather involved formalism , rendering the practical optimization with respect to the perturbative mass parameter not much straightforward ( and only numerical ) .",
    "numerical estimates in reasonable agreement  @xcite with the exactly known mass gap of the @xmath0 gross - neveu ( gn ) model have been obtained in this rg - resummed @xmath2-expansion ( at the few percent accuracy level ) .",
    "the method has also been applied to the qcd basic lagrangian , and results have been obtained for relevant chiral symmetry - breaking quantities like the ( constituant ) quark mass , the quark chiral condensate and pion decay constant  @xcite , using only the ( original ) perturbative informations available at second order for those quantities .",
    "however , admittedly there is not much evidence for a systematic control of the convergence and error of the method from those results , even _",
    "e.g. _ in the gn case where a precise quantitative comparison with known exact mass gap results for arbitrary @xmath1 values can be addressed .",
    "for instance in the gn model , the discrepancy with the exact mass gap @xmath11 depended quite a lot on @xmath1 , and also on the practical method used to optimize the mass parameter .",
    "+ it was also shown  @xcite that at large perturbative orders the method gives a damping of the generic factorial growth of the large order perturbative coefficients ( those due to the usual renormalons ) , but this modification is not sufficient to establish formal convergence of the new series , due to the extra complication brought about by logarithmic dependence in the mass in such renormalizable theories .",
    "a borel resummation can improve the situation  @xcite , but in any case such essentially qualitative large order results are of limited practical use to determine precise non - perturbative predictions for relevant physical quantities , for which in most cases only the very first few order perturbative coefficients are known exactly .",
    "+ despite the lack of a rigorous convergence proof of the method for arbitrary renormalizable models , one may try to improve the basic method in order to obtain eventually more efficient prescriptions and better approximations . in this paper",
    "we reconsider the basic lde - opt construction , but augmented from the very beginning by the information on rg invariance properties of the physical quantities that are calculated .",
    "more precisely , we require the rg invariance to hold at the purely _ perturbative _ level of the @xmath2-expansion and in a most straightforward manner _",
    "i.e. _ consistently at the same order as the perturbative ( non - rg ) available information .",
    "this is in a sense a less ambitious program than constructing explicitly rg - resummed quantities , but as we will see it has the advantage of giving a very transparent procedure with rg properties ` enrooted ' at any step , and using nothing else than the available original purely perturbative information .",
    "this new procedure has immediately as consequence to link the mass and coupling parameters , in a way similar to the standard rg behaviour .",
    "but in addition , since optimization also fixes the perturbative mass parameter , it implies that both the mass and the coupling are fixed , and there are no free parameters , for any given values of the optimized perturbative mass .",
    "of course , this is only due to fixing from optimization a value of the variational mass , and the resulting fixed coupling is similarly a ` variational ' parameter .",
    "but those variational mass and coupling are to be simply replaced in the relevant physical quantity being optimized , giving a relation _",
    "e.g. _ between the latter and the basic scale @xmath12 of the model , typically given in the @xmath13 scheme .",
    "actually , when such rg - improved opt is applied to the dimensionless ratio of the mass gap to @xmath12 , it is completely equivalent to optimizing independently with respect to the two mass and coupling parameters .",
    "all those properties will become clearer as the procedure will be worked out below on a definite model .",
    "having thus summarized some previous developments of the ordinary method , the present work is organized as follows .",
    "ii briefly reviews some known perturbative and non - perturbative results for the @xmath0 gross - neveu model and sets our conventions , defining also rg quantities to be used later on . in sec .",
    "iii we present the lde method and the interpolated gn model , supplemented with the new idea on the incorporation of renormalization group requirements . for illustrative purposes we first define the ingredient of the new rg improved variational method on the particularly simple @xmath14 case , where both the exact mass gap is known  @xcite and its perturbative expansion can be derived to arbitrary large order . in this case",
    "the new procedure is particularly simple and entirely analytic .",
    "it displays remarkable convergence properties as the order of the perturbation expansion increases .",
    "we discuss it in some detail as the generic behaviour of the solutions serves as a very useful guide to the more general case of arbitrary @xmath1 . in section iv we extend this framework to the case of arbitrary @xmath1 values , examining also as an intermediate step the next - to - leading @xmath15 case .",
    "we determine approximations to the mass gap for arbitrary values of @xmath1 and compare those with exact known results to estimate the error of the method .",
    "we discuss some difficulties encountered and a few variants of the method .",
    "finally conclusions are given in section v.",
    "the @xmath0 gross - neveu model  @xcite is described by the lagrangian density for a fermion field given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a @xmath0 vector and summation over @xmath1 is implicit in the above equation . in @xmath18 space - time dimensions",

    "next , @xmath2 is set to the value @xmath40 , such as to recover the original ( massless ) theory at infinite order , while at any finite order @xmath43 there remains a dependence on @xmath21 in the lde of the physical quantity .",
    "considering for the latter typically the case of the pole mass , expanded at order @xmath43 : @xmath44 , the standard , mostly used prescription is an optimization criterion ( principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms )  @xcite ) , requiring at each successive perturbative orders @xmath43 : m^(k)(m , g,=1)_mm 0 [ opt ] thus defining an optimal @xmath43-dependent mass @xmath45 value . up to now",
    "we have described what the standard procedure is in most similar studies , up to some variants in the prescriptions to fix the mass the order @xmath46 to vanish .",

    "the main new ingredient that we add to this procedure , is to supplement the standard mass - fixing prescription ( [ opt ] ) with a direct perturbative rg information .",
    "namely , at any given order @xmath43 of the new lde expansion , we impose , in addition to the mass optimization , that the modified lde series satisfies a standard rg equation at the appropriate perturbative order , _",

    "it is clear that more and more solutions are to be considered when increasing the order and this non - uniqueness of the optimized solution may require extra choice criteria . in fact , up to order @xmath78 in the @xmath52 case the ( multi)-solutions are degenerate and give uniquely the solution of eq .",

    "( [ opt ] ) . although the two equations are now intimately related and are solved together within our approach , to make the link with the standard rg properties it is convenient to consider the rg equation as determining the coupling @xmath26 as function of the mass dependence @xmath81 , while the opt equation finally determines the optimal mass .",
    "but note that both possible solutions of the rg equation , the ` standard ' rg behaviour @xmath82 , or the other solution @xmath83 , lead finally to the same solution of eq .",
    "( [ solln ] ) once substitued into the opt equation ( excluding the trivial solutions @xmath23 or / and @xmath84 ) .",

    "more precisely the rg equation gives ( 1 + l ) ( 1 + 2 + l ( 5 + 2 l ) ) = 0 .",

    "injecting this very odd solution into the opt equation gives ( 1+l)^3(7 + 2l)=0 .",
    "so even if the expected solution @xmath83 reappears ( and recovering again @xmath86 from eq .",

    "this result at nlo in @xmath15 can be attributed to the fact that the @xmath103 first order coefficient in the rg equation is actually the only contribution , all other rg dependence being @xmath118 , and thus the first @xmath2-order rg solution ( [ rgd1 ] ) turns out to give the correct complete rg dependence at this @xmath15 order .",
    "we consider now the second order in the @xmath2-expansion applied to expression ( [ mgn2 ] ) after substitution ( [ subst1 ] ) . at this order ,",
    "the rg and opt equations can still be managed analytically .",
    "solving consistently at order @xmath119 we obtain respectively for the opt eq .",
    "( [ opt ] ) : g=0 , [ opt2 ] and for the rg equation ( [ rgred ] ) : [ rg2 ] & mg^2=0 .",
    "( which again also exhibit trivial solutions @xmath120 and @xmath23 that we of course ignore ) .",
    "+ let us consider first the case @xmath121 as a typical moderate value ( _ i.e. _ sufficently far from large @xmath1 ) .",
    "solving the two coupled rg and opt equations ( [ opt2 ] ) , ( [ rg2 ] ) , one finds five different solutions : three give in fact complex - valued @xmath45 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , that we reject at the moment as _ a priori _ unwanted ` spurious ' solutions , and the two remaining real solutions are & g 1.69 , l -2.52 3.65 + & g 0.41 , l-1.74 1.503 so that the second solution is very close , about @xmath124 above the exact result @xmath125 .",
    "the other real solution is far away , and we now argue that it can be considered spurious . first , the relatively larger absolute values of @xmath71 and @xmath81 for this solution may indicate that it comes from an excessive influence of the higher powers in the polynomial equations , which powers are not to be trusted at this order .",
    "furthermore , a closer inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ opt2]),([rg2 ] ) is easy to do for any @xmath1 , since the rg equation is second order in @xmath71 : expressing the two resulting solutions for @xmath126 , one realizes that only one solution has the correct ` perturbative ' rg and large @xmath1 behaviour : expanding the solutions for large @xmath127 gives : g^(1)(l)- + + o ( ) [ g1sol ] where the first leading term exhibits the correct large @xmath1 and leading logarithm expression for the running coupling : @xmath128 for @xmath129 ( provided that @xmath130 remains of @xmath131 , similarly to the leading and next - to - leading @xmath15 orders above ) , while the other solution gives g^(2)(l)2 + + + o ( ) [ g2sol ] in clear conflict with both the known large @xmath1 behaviour @xmath132 and a standard perturbative rg behaviour of the coupling .",
    "according to the lesson of the large @xmath1 limit , we are lead to select uniquely the first solution , which indeed is the one giving @xmath133 .",
    "the same is observed for any @xmath134 values : according to the rg behaviour criteria , we uniquely select the first solution and this gives the result collected in table [ tabn ] .",
    "we also give for illustration the corresponding values of @xmath130 : one can remark that for arbitrary @xmath134 , the solutions are such that all @xmath130 values remains of order @xmath135 and regularly tends towards @xmath135 for increasing @xmath1 , which is an a posterori crosscheck of the right perturbative rg behaviour of the solution ( [ g1sol ] ) .",
    "moreover , the absolute value of the second derivative with respect to the mass is smaller for this solution , which is an additional indication of the expected behaviour similarly with the large @xmath1 above results .",
    "also , in analogy with the @xmath51 case , we can study for arbitrary @xmath1 the surfaces at second @xmath2-order , @xmath136 : let us just mention that from a direct minimization in the @xmath137 plane the same values for @xmath134 of @xmath138 as those in table [ tabn ] are recovered , and that these surfaces exhibit an increasingly flat behaviour around those extrema for increasing @xmath1 .",
    "+    .[tabn ] combined opt+rg results at second @xmath2-order , selecting solution ( [ g1sol ] ) , for the gn mass gap for different @xmath1 , with the corresponding values of optimal mass parameter @xmath139 and coupling @xmath88 , as compared with @xmath140 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     overall these results can be considered very stable : a large variation of the third - order coefficient , @xmath141 , leads to very reasonable changes in the final result .",
    "moreover even for the extreme lower and upper bounds @xmath142 , the results bound very well ( and remain rather close to ) the exact mass gap . note that the renormalon - inspired coefficient @xmath143 grows fastly with @xmath1 , since @xmath144 , but this does not prevent the mass gap result to be close to the exact one for sufficiently large @xmath1 . while some among the multi solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ optrg ] ) are clearly unphysical or can reflect instabilities , the reason is that selecting the opt + rg solution giving the correct large @xmath1 behaviour for the coupling , namely @xmath145 , implies that the @xmath146 compensates for the renormalon @xmath147 behaviour for large @xmath1 .",
    "we also checked finally that there are intermediate values of @xmath148 such that a well - behaved solution is real and very close to the exact mass gap ( for instance this happens for @xmath149 for @xmath112 ) .",
    "we have examined a very simple additional ingredient to the standard variational opt approach , in order to supplement it with rg perturbative information .",
    "the procedure is very transparent and largely analytical at second order .",
    "it has as immediate consequence to fix both the mass and the coupling such that there are no free parameters for the massive gn model typically . those variational mass and coupling are to be simply used to evaluate the physical quantity to be optimized , giving a physically relevant relation _",
    "e.g. _ between the latter and the basic scale @xmath12 .",
    "moreover it is completely equivalent to optimizing _ independently _ simply with respect to the mass and coupling parameters .",
    "+ although our results are numerical and not a proof of convergence of the method , by adding the rg behaviour content of the theory in this most simple way we obtain successful approximations of the exact mass gap below or at most at the percent level for arbitrary @xmath1 values , using only the purely perturbative information .",
    "+ one may wonder why the gn model behaves so well , in comparison _",
    "e.g. _ with the bec model where the convergence appears slower  @xcite , despite its super - renormalizable properties implying that only the mass has non - trivial rg properties .",
    "of course the gn model for large @xmath1 is a particularly simple theory , where the original perturbative coefficients do not exhibit the standard factorial divergences of most field theory perturbative series .",
    "but for arbitrary @xmath1 the perturbative relation between the pole and lagrangian mass , as well as rg properties , are very similar to those in more complicated theories , such as qcd typically . in fact , even the large - order behaviour of the coefficients of this perturbative series in the massive gn case have a similar , badly factorially divergent , ( renormalon ) behaviour  @xcite . in that respect",
    "the results obtained here with a fast numerical convergence at the percent level or less , and controllable from understood rg behaviour , are to be considered very encouraging for similar analysis in more involved @xmath8 theories where @xmath150 exact s - matrix and tba results are inapplicable , and where the mass gap and other related non - perturbative quantities are not known and usually not expected to be derivable from first principles .",
    "this will be the object of future works .",
