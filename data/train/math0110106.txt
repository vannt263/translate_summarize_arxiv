    "a * contact sphere * is a triple of @xmath4-forms @xmath7 on a @xmath0-manifold such that any non - trivial linear combination of these forms ( with constant coefficients ) is a contact form .    in other words ,",
    "we require that the @xmath0-form @xmath8 be nowhere zero , i.e.  a volume form , for any @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the name ` contact sphere ' derives from the fact that it suffices to check this condition for points @xmath11 on the unit sphere @xmath12 .",
    "a contact sphere @xmath13 is called * taut * if the contact form @xmath14 defines the same volume form for all @xmath15 .    the requirement for a contact sphere to be taut is equivalent to the system of equations ( for @xmath16 ) @xmath17 a straightforward calculation shows that one can then find a @xmath4-form @xmath18 and a nowhere zero function @xmath19 such that @xmath20 where @xmath21 runs over the cyclic permutations of @xmath22 .",
    "notice that @xmath19 is defined by @xmath23 .    the analogous structure of a ( taut ) contact circle , defined in terms of two contact forms @xmath24 , was studied in our previous papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we gave a complete classification of the closed , orientable @xmath0-manifolds that admit a taut contact circle or a taut contact sphere :    [ thm : classold ] let @xmath25 be a closed @xmath0-manifold .",

    "in the course of this paper we shall present a new proof , more self - contained than the one given in  @xcite , of the fact that the universal cover of a closed @xmath0-manifold admitting a taut contact sphere is diffeomorphic to  @xmath34 .",
    "in @xcite we showed that every closed , orientable @xmath0-manifold admits a ( non - taut ) contact circle , and we gave examples of contact spheres .",
    "for instance , @xmath35 , described in terms of coordinates @xmath36 , does not admit any taut contact circles by theorem  [ thm : classold ] , but it admits the contact sphere @xmath37    in @xcite we described deformation spaces for taut contact circles and gave a complete classification of taut contact circles .",
    "the present paper achieves the corresponding classification for taut contact spheres .",
    "the investigation of taut contact spheres amounts to a systematic study of hyperkhler metrics with a homothety , in a sense made precise below .",

    "in contrast with @xmath0-sasakian structures , taut contact spheres do not , in general , give rise to a cone metric on @xmath38 ( in other words , the relevant homothety is not a dilatation ; such general homotheties also appear in  @xcite ) .",

    "conformally equivalent ( taut ) contact spheres determine isomorphic conformal ( resp .",
    "hyperkhler ) structures .    as we shall see in section  [ section : hyper ] , the hyperkhler structure @xmath51 on @xmath52 induced by a taut contact sphere @xmath13 on @xmath39 is given by the equations @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the @xmath55-coordinate , and the complex structures @xmath56 are @xmath57-invariant .",
    "often we write the hyperkhler structure as the triple @xmath58 of symplectic forms .",
    "these symplectic forms are homogeneous of degree @xmath4 with respect to the vector field @xmath57 , that is , @xmath59 .",
    "the hyperkhler metric @xmath60 has the same homogeneity .    for reversing this construction , it is useful to make the following definition .",
    "a vector field @xmath61 on a hyperkhler manifold is called * tri - liouville * if it is a liouville vector field for every parallel self - dual @xmath1-form  @xmath62 , that is , @xmath63 .",
    "notice that a tri - liouville vector field is automatically homothetic for the hyperkhler metric , but the converse is not true .",

    "the corresponding taut contact sphere is defined on any transversal to the flow of @xmath61 by restricting the triple of @xmath4-forms @xmath64 to that transversal . for",
    "the formal statement see proposition  [ prop : hyper2 ] .",
    "we also show that for a naturally ordered taut contact sphere @xmath65 on @xmath39 there is the following _ pointwise _ model on @xmath38 for the triple of symplectic forms @xmath58 , expressed in quaternionic notation : at any point @xmath66 , there is a quaternionic coordinate @xmath67 for the tangent space @xmath68 such that @xmath69    the key to the classification of taut contact spheres is then the following statement .",
    "[ thm : flat ] the hyperkhler metric on @xmath70 induced by a taut contact sphere on a closed @xmath0-manifold @xmath25 is flat .",

    "this proves the theorem .",
    "this theorem implies that on a closed manifold the _ pointwise _ model above for the triple of symplectic forms @xmath81 , @xmath82 , coming from a taut contact sphere , is actually a _",
