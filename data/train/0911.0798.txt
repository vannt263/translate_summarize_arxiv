    "the observational evidence available to date indicates that a major star - forming epoch in a galaxy s history will generate a new set of star clusters that accompanies its population of ` field ' stars .",
    "thus , it is physically meaningful to think of a _ subsystem _ of star clusters as consisting of all clusters formed in a given starburst , and to treat the clusters as a proxy for the stellar subpopulation formed in the same burst ( see de grijs 2010 and larsen 2010 for more extensive treatments of cluster formation in starburst environments ) .",
    "the huge advantage offered by star clusters is that they are easily bright enough to be measured individually within galaxies as distant as 100 mpc and even beyond , and in giant galaxies particularly , they can be found in large numbers ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we can then construct _ distribution functions _ of such key parameters as mass , age and heavy - element abundance ( metallicity ) for the clusters , instead of just the luminosity - weighted averages that we get from the unresolved field - star light .",
    "the milky way star cluster system ( our starting point for all such work and the ` baseline ' comparison system for all other galaxies ) separates out rather cleanly into the two classic subsystems : the _ open clusters _ ( found throughout the disc and spiral arms along low - eccentricity orbits ) and the _ globular clusters _ ( gcs , inhabiting the galactic bulge and halo in a roughly isotropic distribution of orbits ) . in addition , the gcs are distinctly older than the open clusters ( although with a small range of overlap around @xmath010 gyr ) , as well as more massive and less enriched in heavy elements , indicating that they belonged to a brief early stage of rapid star formation and chemical enrichment .",
    "the open clusters , like the general population of disc field stars , are found at any age but over a more restricted range of metallicities , marking the more gradual ongoing growth of the galaxy s disc .",
    "but in even the nearest external galaxies ( the magellanic clouds , m31 and the other local group galaxies ) , this convenient dichotomy disappears .",
    "the clouds , for example , contain small numbers of classically old , massive , metal - poor gcs as well as many analogues of open clusters , but we also find numerous examples of high - mass , _ young _ clusters that likely resemble gcs as they would have been closer to their formation time .",
    "investigations of star cluster systems in other galaxies reveal still richer varieties , to the stage where every part of the star cluster age / mass / metallicity three - parameter space is occupied .    for thorough reviews and perspectives on the earlier literature up to @xmath12005 , interested readers should see harris & racine ( 1979 ) , harris ( 1991 , 2001 ) , ashman & zepf ( 1998 ) and brodie & strader ( 2006 ) .",
    "the present article will concentrate on recent developments in gc system ( gcs ) studies , leading up to a list of currently challenging questions .",
    "this short and biased discussion unfortunately can not do justice to the diversity and richness of approaches now underway , and ( happily ) it will be doomed to be quickly superseded by the rapid advance of both theory and data .",
    "perhaps the most important single implication of the work in this area , however , is that the old gcs represent a common thread in early galaxy evolution , dating back to the first star formation within the pregalactic gas clouds .    ) . _",

    "some perspective should be offered at this point about the links between models and observations .",
    "this field is at basis a branch of old stellar populations extended to the full range of galaxy types .",
    "gcs studies began as a strongly data - dominated subject , with most discoveries coming directly from photometric and spectroscopic surveys that were guided primarily by the astrophysical intuition of the observers .",
    "quantitative models tended to follow later .",
    "some branches of astrophysics ( e.g. , big - bang cosmology , stellar structure , stellar dynamics ) have clear mathematical foundations accompanied by small numbers of distinctive ` parameters ' that can be invoked to design new observing programmes .",
    "this near - equal cooperation between models and data is not currently the situation here , and a genuine understanding of the formation and evolution of star cluster systems within their parent galaxies is a considerably more complex issue .",
    "it starts on the broad platform of the hierarchically merging galaxy - formation era , and continues with the operation of gas dynamics at all scales , from protogalaxies down to protostars , simultaneously with other key elements including galaxy mergers , satellite accretions and dynamical evolution of compact stellar systems . in the face of this complexity , making the transition from models which are ` scenarios ' ( even if basically accurate ) to ones that are both quantitative and realistic in detail is a steep challenge .",
    "nevertheless , with the rapid advance of high - performance computation and the ability to simulate these processes at a genuinely deep level , we can look forward to major progress on the theory front .",
    "at least some key features of gcs formation have , however , been isolated . at one extreme",
    "lie the smallest dwarf galaxies that have shallow potential wells which can support only a brief initial starburst or else much slower , less dramatic star formation .",
    "these early , low - metallicity _ pregalactic dwarfs _ were probably the formation sites of the metal - poor blue - sequence gcs ( although also leaving behind an intriguing ` specific - frequency problem ' , see below ) ( searle & zinn 1978 ; harris & pudritz 1994 ; burgarella _ et al .",

    "_ 2008 ) . at the other extreme",
    "are the giant and supergiant ellipticals whose gcss are almost certainly composite populations .",
    "they will have gcs originating from _ dissipational collapse _ with huge amounts of gas undergoing star formation spread over several episodes , _ dissipationless accretion _ of satellites coming in later with their own small populations of gcs and _ major merging _ of progenitor disc or elliptical galaxies , with various mixtures of stars and gas .",
    "how important each of these contributions will be for a given galaxy must be driven by its size , environment and the stochastically governed individual hierarchical - merging history .",
    "major attempts to follow these processes simultaneously have been carried out for giant ellipticals in a semianalytic model ( beasley _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) and for the milky way in cosmological simulations ( bekki & chiba 2001 ; kravtsov & gnedin 2005 ) , but these are still exploratory and use prescriptive rules for star and cluster formation .",
    "however , syntheses of these approaches are developing ( bekki _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 ) and hydrodynamic simulations of the important cases of gc formation in major mergers and in pregalactic dwarfs are approaching the dynamical range required to resolve individual clusters ( bournaud _ et al .",

    "a key and ( fortunately ) observationally prominent marker of evolution in a stellar population is its heavy - element abundance or _",
    "metallicity_. the increase in mean metallicity with time  driven by steady conversion of gas into stars and the cycle of stellar evolution and supernova - driven enrichment  is extremely rapid at the earliest times when the gas fractions are highest",
    ". it also seems to be rapid in some of the most violent and shock - driven star - forming environments .",
    "the _ metallicity distribution function _ ( mdf ) is thus one of the most important directly observable tracers of this history .",
    "a major discovery characterizing gcss is that the whole mdf breaks into a strikingly _ bimodal _ form , with a metal - poor mode centred near [ fe / h](mp ) @xmath2 dex and a metal - rich mode centred near [ fe / h](mr ) @xmath3 dex .",
    "a graphic illustration of this two - subpopulation division , as it is most frequently measured , is shown in figure [ cmd_6gal ] .",
    "broadband photometric indices such as in figure  2 for gcs older than @xmath4 gyr become quite insensitive to age and thus the colour reflects the cluster heavy - element abundance surprisingly well . by convention , the metal - poor gcs",
    "are often called the _ blue sequence _ while the metal - richer ones are the _ red sequence_. the translation from gc colour to metallicity ( which is monotonic , but may be nonlinear ) is ultimately established from spectroscopic abundance measurements , which have now been done in several galaxies ( see the work by brodie & huchra 1990 ; cohen _ et al .",

    "the intrinsic dispersion must represent the overall growth of enrichment during a major star - forming period : a cluster forming slightly later in the sequence will start with a larger amount of pre - enrichment in its parent giant molecular cloud . however , a more subtle trend is that the mean metallicity of each sequence increases steadily with host - galaxy luminosity . expressed in terms of heavy - element abundance @xmath15 ,",

    "+ in qualitative terms , this mean - metallicity scaling indicates that a random gc ( either metal - poor or metal - rich ) drawn from a _ present - day _ dwarf galaxy has a lower enrichment than one drawn from a giant , thus arguing against pure major - merger or dissipationless accretion scenarios in which ( for example ) the blue - sequence clusters now present within a giant galaxy all formed within smaller progenitors later accreted into the bigger central potential .",
    "caveat _ to this view ( see brodie & strader 2006 ) is that an isolated pregalactic dwarf should have a different and more truncated enrichment history than its counterparts lying within the deeper large - scale potential well of an emerging giant elliptical . the key hint from the data ,",

    "effectively , the blue gcs become progressively more heavy - element enriched at higher cluster mass .",
    "the exact form of the correlation was a matter of debate in the first round of papers , but a consensus has been emerging around two conclusions : ( i ) the blue sequence is essentially vertical for the less massive clusters in the range @xmath19 m@xmath20 , that is , @xmath21 for low - mass gcs .",
    "but at progressively higher @xmath22 ( extending up to the most luminous gcs known at @xmath23 l@xmath20 ) , the blue sequence bends towards redder colours , eventually following a slope near @xmath24 at its top end ( harris 2009@xmath10 ; peng _ et al .",
    "( ii ) no such trend has been found along the _ red _ sequence , which is indistinguishable from vertical in all systems studied so far .",
    "detecting this mmr clearly requires internally precise photometry and very large gc samples because clusters above the @xmath25 m@xmath20 level ( where the mmr becomes most noticeable ) are rare and the changes in mean colour are not large ( see again figure  [ cmd_6gal ] ) .",

    "a sufficiently massive and dense protocluster ( @xmath26 m@xmath20 of gas within a 1  pc protocluster core ) can provide a sufficiently deep potential well and enough dense gas to hold back a high fraction of the enriched supernova ejecta from the first round of massive stars within the protocluster , which can then enrich the still - forming lower - main - sequence stars .",

    "_ the mean metallicity of the entire gcs in large galaxies has long been known to decrease outward in the halo .",

    "the possibility that most of the metal - rich clusters in elliptical galaxies formed through major mergers ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) does not , by itself , solve the original ` @xmath59 problem ' because such large amounts of incoming gas are needed to make the thousands of gcs in giant ellipticals at any plausible formation efficiency that this version of their origin becomes similar to basic hierarchical merging ( cf .",
    "harris 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath59 values calculated separately for the red and blue gcs vary systematically and nonlinearly with galaxy luminosity , a pattern thoroughly discussed by peng _",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "a newer ` specific - frequency problem ' is exemplified in figure [ n5128halo ] .",
    "the nearby giant elliptical system ngc 5128 offers a rare opportunity to compare the mdfs of the gcs _ and _ the halo red - giant stars in the same galaxy .",
    "our zeroth - order assumption is that a major formation episode in a galaxy s history should produce gcs in direct proportion to the amount of gas .",
    "if so , the mdfs of both types of stellar populations should have the same shape , being merely scaled versions of each other .",
    "this is plainly not the case ( see figure  6 ) : there are about five times fewer metal - poor halo stars _ per unit gc at the same metallicity _ than there are metal - rich halo stars .    the analyses for this and other galaxies ( e.g. , forte _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) show that metal - rich gcs match the mean metallicity and dispersion of the halo giants well enough to further support the default interpretation that they formed along with the bulk of the galaxy s spheroid .",
    "but where are the many metal - poor stars that should go along with the metal - poor clusters ?",
    "interestingly , similarly high @xmath59 values can be found in some low - luminosity des , whose gcs are predominantly metal - poor ( peng _ et al . _ 2008 ) .",
    "one possible solution is that the metal - poor halo stars are present , but they occupy a much shallower spatial distribution than the metal - rich spheroid , just as the low - metallicity clusters form a spatially more extended subsystem than the metal - rich clusters .",
    "the metal - poor field halo would become dominant only at larger galactocentric distances than have normally been searched ( see harris _",
    "_ 2007 for some tantalizing evidence along those lines ) .",
    "another is a timing argument : if the massive , dense protoclusters formed earliest in the pregalactic clouds , and if later star formation were partially truncated ( perhaps by the epoch of reionization ) , then @xmath59(blue ) would end up artificially high ( harris & harris 2002 ) .",
    "a step towards a more quantitative interpretation has been developed by peng _",
    "( 2008 ) , who argue that the gc formation rate will scale with both the star - formation rate and the star - formation - rate density , thus boosting cluster formation at high redshifts .",
    "much remains to be discovered about the determining conditions of gc formation .",
    "the study of gc populations in galaxies provides a unique observational window on galaxy formation .",
    "a shortlist of the questions that have emerged from recent work would certainly include the following :    1 .   what is the physical cause of bimodality",
    "? it does not automatically emerge from current semianalytic or cosmological simulations without deliberately inserting an external truncation mechanism such as reionization ( beasley _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ; kravstov & gnedin 2005 ) . was the formation of intermediate - metallicity clusters truncated near @xmath60 , _ in the same way in all major galaxies ? _ or were those clusters present but somehow biased towards smaller masses , which would then have been removed more easily by dynamical evolution ?",
    "2 .   why was the formation of metal - poor , blue gcs so efficient relative to the ` normal ' , red gcs ?",
    "do the outermost parts of galaxy haloes possess large numbers of metal - poor stars ? more generally , what features of the gas dynamics and composition inside a giant molecular cloud determine the formation efficiency of massive clusters ?",
    "the formation of a giant elliptical galaxy may have finished with a few major , gas - rich mergers , each of which generated metal - rich clusters .",
    "thus , the red gc ` sequence ' is , in itself , probably a composite population . is there a way to deconvolve the red sequence into its age / metallicity components ? 4 .",
    "` field ' ellipticals typically have low specific frequencies and are the most likely to have formed from late major mergers . but",
    "these are very incompletely surveyed by comparison with the gc - rich ellipticals in the virgo , fornax and abell clusters .",
    "do they show the same features of bimodality , the same gc luminosity functions and the same proportions of red / blue clusters as the rich ellipticals ?",
    "gcs more massive than @xmath25 m@xmath20 belong to an intriguing ` transition region ' characterized by an mmr , increasing scale size , higher mass - to - light ratios and ( as we see in massive milky way gcs ) multiple internal stellar populations .",
    "what drives these systematic changes at the high - mass end of the gc sequence ?",
    "cluster mergers ? increasing importance of dark matter ? can all compact stellar systems , from gcs through ucds and elliptical galaxies , eventually be placed onto a single astrophysical sequence ? 6 .",
    "what is the total evolution of a massive star cluster from birth to death ? a comprehensive evolutionary model needs to include the gas dynamics of its formation within a giant molecular cloud , early rapid gas - mass loss , ongoing internal dynamical evolution , slower secular evolution including the effects of the external tidal field and eventual dissolution into the field .",
    "pieces of these steps are understood , sometimes in much detail , but a comprehensive end - to - end story still awaits assembly .",
