    ", some studies focused on the assembly of stellar mass density at high redshift by comparing the observational data and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. dickinson et al . 2003 ; fontana et al . 2003 ; poli et al .",
    "these works have suggested that the hierarchical structure formation theory may have difficulty in accounting for sufficient early star formation .",
    "the concern grew with the mounting evidence for high redshift galaxy formation including the discovery of extremely red objects ( eros ) at @xmath16 , sub - millimeter galaxies at @xmath17 , lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath18 , and lyman-@xmath19 emitters at @xmath20 .",
    "we now face the important question as to whether this evidence for high - redshift galaxy formation is consistent with the concordance @xmath1cdm model .",

    "figure 1 shows the stellar mass vs. _ g - r _ color of the simulated galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "the most massive galaxies have stellar masses @xmath21 , and uv colors @xmath22 , consistent with the uv color selection criteria of steidel et al .",
    "the differences in the distribution of the points can be understood in terms of the different box sizes and the randomness of the initial condition of the simulations . on the right - hand - side of the panels",
    ", there are a couple of red , passive systems that have stellar masses @xmath23 .",
    "the near - ir properties of these passive systems will be reported in future papers .",
    "figure 2 shows the star formation histories of the most massive and most reddest galaxies in the simulations . for the most massive systems , the star formation rate has a continuous component of @xmath24 over a few gyrs , and a starburst component exists on top of the continuous component that reaches up to @xmath10 .",
    "such extreme star formation histories allow these galaxies to build up stellar masses larger than a few @xmath25 by @xmath0 .",
    "the tvd simulation indicates somewhat more sporadic star formation history , which is perhaps due to the differences in the details of the star formation recipe and the resolution .",
    "figure 3 shows the star formation history of the entire simulation box . in panel",
    "( a ) , all the models including the analytic model of hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) show that the sfr density peaks at @xmath26 .",
    "these sfr histories lead to early build - up of the stellar mass density compared to both the current observational estimates and the results of the semianalytic models ( see nagamine et al .",
    "2004b for a direct comparison ) , and we predict that 70 ( 50 , 30)% of the total stellar mass at @xmath13 had already been formed by @xmath14 ( 2 , 3 ) based on these theoretical models .    in summary , we have shown that the simulations based on the hierarchical cdm model can in fact account for the masses and the comoving number densities of the massive galaxies at @xmath0 that are found by the recent observations .",
    "our simulations indicate that the properties ( i.e. stellar mass , color , sf history , clustering ) of the uv bright lbgs at @xmath17 can be understood if they are identified with the galaxies that reside in the massive dark matter halos at the time ."
