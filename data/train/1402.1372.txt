    "the synthesis of graphene , a two - dimensional atomic layer of carbon atoms on a honeycomb lattice , has generated a new area of condensed - matter physics in which basic physics associated with the existence of dirac cones is intertwined with a huge potential for applications such as electronic devices , hydrogen storage materials , and lithium - ion battery materials  @xcite .",
    "device - oriented applications of graphene are based on the possibility to open and tune a band gap from the semimetallic dirac states  @xcite .",
    "this can be realized by breaking the sublattice symmetry or the chiral symmetry  @xcite , and by chemical functionalization of adsorbing hydrogen or fluorine on graphene  @xcite . even if the functionalization could in principle open the gap , the adsorbed atoms tend to segregate in clusters , strongly limiting the applicative potential of these phases .",

    "graphynes can be ideally obtained inserting carbon atoms with triple bonds ( c@xmath4c ) between pairs of sp@xmath1-bonded carbons in graphene , forming a sp - sp@xmath1 hybrid carbon network on a two - dimensional hexagonal lattice  @xcite .",

    "more recently , a semimetal states with double dirac cones has been predicted for 6,6,12-graphyne  @xcite .    just like in graphene , one can in principle open and tune a band gap in the different graphyne structures .",
    "some of us have shown by means of dft calculations that adsorbed hydrogen atoms prefer different geometries according to the type of graphyne  @xcite , leading in turn to different electronic properties .",
    "for instance , h atoms in @xmath0-graphyne ( c@xmath5h@xmath6 ) , where each sp - bonded c atom accommodate one h atom , prefer an in - plane configuration and the electronic structure remains semimetallic regardless of the attached h atoms , while h atoms adsorbed on @xmath3-graphyne prefer an oblique configuration with respect to the plane , and the energy band gap dramatically widens to 2.19 ev from the 0.47 ev of the pure compound  @xcite .",

    "we obtained that @xmath0- and @xmath2-graphynes are semimetal and @xmath3-graphyne is semiconducting with a band gap of 0.34 ev .",
    "these results are qualitatively and also quantitatively similar to those of pure graphyne .    based on these dft results",
    "we have derived a tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "our parameterization neglects the hybridization effects between the sp - bonded c atoms and the attached h atoms because the dft results do not show significant differences in the electronic structures of pure and hydrogenated graphynes .",
    "consequently we assume that the bonding configuration among the p@xmath12 orbitals of different sites still form @xmath13 bands , like pure cases without h atoms .",
    "our tight - binding hamiltonian has therefore the form @xmath14 where the site index ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) runs over all the carbon atoms , which can be either sp@xmath1-bonded ( labelled as `` 2 '' ) and sp - bonded ( labelled as `` 1 '' ) hosting a h atom .",

    "we obtain a value of 0.7 ev , which is slightly smaller than that of graphene and pure @xmath0-graphyne without the absorbed h atoms  @xcite .    in principle one may expect that both @xmath2- and @xmath3-graphynes should become insulating with a charge - density - wave ordering because of the broken symmetry between the two sublattices , as it has been observed recently in quasi - neutral molecular graphene with an additional co molecule  @xcite .",

    "the dft results can be therefore rationalized in terms of the effective hopping between c atoms on the sites of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the semimetallic state in @xmath2-graphyne is therefore explained by an effective @xmath34 smaller than @xmath35 , while the charge - density - wave insulating state with a band gap of 0.23 ev of @xmath3-graphyne is a consequence of a larger effective hopping on the ideal honeycomb lattice , which satisfies@xmath36 .",

    "we elaborate on the physical origin of the different configurations . in a very simple picture ,",
    "if the h atom is in the `` oblique '' configuration , the p@xmath12-p@xmath12 hybridization between sp@xmath1-bonded c without h atom and sp - bonded c with h atom would be reduced , because the h atom attracts the @xmath37 orbital in sp - bonded c atom .",
    "therefore , a finite angle between the c - h bond and the graphyne plane reflects in a reduced hopping element @xmath20 .",

    "the agreement is extremely good over the whole brillouin zone for @xmath3-graphyne , while some discrepancies are visible in @xmath2-graphyne .",

    "in conclusion , we have explored the geometrical configurations of h atoms absorbed on sp - bonded c atoms of @xmath0- , @xmath2- , @xmath3- , and 6,6,12-graphynes and the consequent electronic properties . in the latter case",
    "we show for the first time that adsorption of hydrogen removes the dirac cones of pure 6,6,12-graphyne leading to a semiconductor with a gap of 1.17 ev which strongly depends on the h atom configuration .    using dft calculations , we first studied the electronic properties of the cases with in - plane configurations of the adsorbed h atoms in @xmath0- , @xmath2- , and @xmath3-graphynes . and then , we established a simplified tight - binding model with lattice parameters based on the in - plane configurations of attached h atoms .",
    "starting from the tight - binding model , we mimicked the p@xmath12-p@xmath12 hybridization associated to an off - plane oblique configuration by means of a tuned hopping parameter .",
    "this simple picture allows to understand why the in - plane configuration of h atom is stable in @xmath0-graphyne , while oblique configurations are favoured in @xmath2- and @xmath3-graphynes .",
