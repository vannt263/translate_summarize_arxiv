    "a mid - galactic latitude pulsar survey with the parkes radio telescope @xcite detected three new pulsars in binary systems , none of which easily fits within the standard evolutionary scenarios proposed for the majority of recycled pulsars .",
    "one of them , psr  j1744@xmath03922 , was independently discovered during the reprocessing of the parkes multibeam pulsar survey data @xcite .",
    "this 172-ms binary pulsar has a relatively high surface dipole magnetic field strength ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) suggesting it is mildly recycled .",
    "however , it appears to have a very light companion ( minimum mass @xmath6 ) in a tight and nearly circular 4.6-hr orbit ( see table [ t : orbparams ] ) .",
    "this type of orbit and companion are typical of those of fully recycled pulsars ( which we define as pulsars with @xmath7ms and @xmath8 g ) with he white dwarf ( wd ) companions .",
    "thus , why psr  j1744@xmath03922escaped being fully recycled is a puzzle .",
    "in addition to this atypical combination of spin and orbital properties , psr  j1744@xmath03922  exhibits strong pulsed radio flux modulations , making the pulsar undetectable at 1400mhz for lengths of time ranging from a few tens of seconds to tens of minutes .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that this behavior might be the nulling phenomenon seen in a handful of slow , isolated pulsars .",
    "nulling is a broad - band , if not total , interruption of the radio emission for a temporary period of time . on the other hand , although nulling could affect pulsars in binary systems as well , many binary pulsars vary due to external effects such as eclipses",
    ". such external effects might explain psr  j1744@xmath03922 s variability as well .    in this paper",
    ", we first report on multi - frequency observations of this pulsar that suggest the radio variability is not intrinsic to the pulsar .",
    "however , our analysis does not show strong evidence of a correlation between radio flux and orbital phase , as one might expect from traditional eclipse - like variability .",
    "we then report on our infrared search for a counterpart of the companion using the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "this observation has identified a @xmath3 star at the position determined by the radio timing observations .",
    "finally , we examine why other properties of this pulsar make it incompatible with standard evolutionary scenarios , and identify a few other systems which have similar characteristics .",
    "the addition of psr  j1744@xmath03922  as an extreme case among this group motivates us to identify a possible new class of binary pulsars .",
    "we propose several possible evolutionary channels which might produce members of this class and explain how the nature of the companion to psr  j1744@xmath03922  could be used to constrain the origin of these systems .",
    "the observed average pulsed radio emission from a pulsar can fluctuate for several different reasons .",
    "these include effects from the pulsar itself , as in nulling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its environment , as in eclipsing binary pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the interstellar medium , as in scintillation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of psr  j1744@xmath03922 , during a typical 1400mhz observation , the radio emission seems to turn on and off randomly on timescales varying from tens of seconds to tens of minutes ( see figure [ f : profile ] for sample folded profiles ) . in many instances ,",
    "the pulsar is undetectable through entire observations ( @xmath9min ) . in a previous analysis of these radio flux modulations ,",
    "@xcite concluded on the basis of observations at 1400mhz that psr  j1744@xmath03922  is probably a pulsar experiencing pulse nulls .",
    "as nulling is a broad - band phenomenon ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we decided to investigate the frequency dependence of the fluctuations in order to test the nulling hypothesis .",
    "the work we report is based on an extended dataset combining both the data reported independently by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "a total of 112 radio timing observations of psr  j1744@xmath03922  were made at the 64-meter parkes telescope and the 100-meter green bank telescope between 2003 june and 2006 january .",
    "relevant details for the current study are summarized in table [ t : setups ] and we refer to the above two papers for more details about the observational setups and timing results .    for the purpose of studying the radio emission variability , we made time series of the pulsed flux intensity .",
    "we dedispersed the data at the pulsar s dispersion measure ( dm ) of 148.5pc@xmath10 and then folded the resulting time series in 10-s intervals using the timing ephemerides from @xcite . for each observation ,",
    "the pulse phase was determined from the profile averaged over the entire observation .",
    "we fit each 10-s interval of the folded pulse profile with a constant baseline plus a gaussian of variable amplitude having a fixed width at the predetermined phase .",
    "a gaussian fwhm=0.01964@xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the pulse period , nicely fits the profile averaged over many observations in the frequency range 680 - 4600mhz .",
    "errors on the best - fit amplitudes returned by our least - square minimization procedure were scaled under the assumption that the off - pulse region rms represents the total system noise .",
    "although no flux standard has been observed , we obtained pulsed flux density estimates by using the radiometer equation and equating predicted noise levels to the off - pulse rms level .",
    "we also accounted for the offset between the telescope pointing and the real position of the source ( since in the early observations the best - fit timing position had not yet been determined ) by approximating the telescope sensitivity to be an azimuthally symmetric gaussian having a fwhm corresponding to the radio telescope beam size , which is 8.8@xmath12 and 13.8@xmath12 at 1400mhz for gbt and parkes , respectively .    in this way",
    ", we generated flux time series for all 112 observations of psr  j1744@xmath03922  ( see figure [ f : lightcurve ] for examples ) . as we describe next , these results show that scintillation and nulling are highly unlikely to be the origin of the observed variability .",
    "as @xcite discussed previously , interstellar scintillation ( iss ) is unlikely to be the source of fluctuations in psr  j1744@xmath03922 .",
    "scintillation is produced by a diffractive scattering medium along our line of sight and the typical diffractive scintillation timescale can be expressed as ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath13    with @xmath14 the distance to the source in kpc , @xmath15 the decorrelation bandwidth in mhz , @xmath16 the observed frequency in ghz and @xmath17 the velocity of iss diffraction pattern in kms@xmath18 . for the 1400mhz observation shown in figure [ f : profile ] , for example , the ne2001 model for the galactic distribution of free electrons @xcite predicts @xmath19mhz in the line of sight of psr  j1744@xmath03922  at a distance of 3.0kpc estimated from the dm .",
    "@xmath17 is typically dominated by the pulsar velocities , which are in the range 10 - 100kms@xmath18 for most binaries .",
    "therefore , we estimate the scintillation timescale to be of the order of a few seconds to a minute at most",
    ". this could be compatible with the fast flux variations but can certainly not explain the extended periods where the pulsar goes undetected .",
    "perhaps most importantly , strong scintillations will be averaged away since typical observing bandwidths are much larger than the decorrelation bandwidth , and therefore contain many `` scintles '' .",
    "such averaging effectively rules out the iss hypothesis .",
    "another possibility is that the flux modulation is related to intrinsic nulling of the pulsar .",
    "based on observations at 1400mhz only , @xcite identified it as the most likely explanation . only observed in old , isolated pulsars so far , ( though nothing prevents a binary pulsar from being a nuller ) nulling is a broad - band , if not total , interruption of the radio emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "considering the fraction of observations with no detection of radio emission at various frequencies ( see table [ t : nodetection ] ) , we note qualitatively that psr  j1744@xmath03922  is regularly undetectable at low frequencies but easily detectable at high . for instance",
    ", we obtained four parkes observations at 680 and 2900mhz simultaneously in which the pulsar is detected twice at 2900mhz while remaining undetected at 680mhz .",
    "in addition , seven long gbt observations centered at 1850 and 1950mhz show highly variable emission but little evidence that the pulsar ever disappears completely ( see figure [ f : lightcurve ] ) . clearly",
    ", however , observations could be biased by the relative instrumental sensitivity in each band and by the intrinsic spectrum of the pulsar .",
    "to investigate the effect of instrumental sensitivity and spectral energy distribution , we analysed the pulsed flux densities at different frequencies .",
    "measured values were estimated using the radiometer equation as explained in section [ ss : procedure ] and are displayed in table [ t : flux ] .",
    "we note that @xcite reported a different flux density than ours at 1400mhz ( 0.20(3 ) vs. 0.11(3)mjy , respectively ) .",
    "the discrepancy could be because the average flux density changes depending on the amount of time psr  j1744@xmath03922  spends in its `` bright state '' during an observation . the large standard deviation ( 0.16mjy , see table [ t : flux ] ) at this frequency suggests that by restricting the calculation to observations for which psr  j1744@xmath03922  is nicely detected , a higher flux value can be obtained .    for the simultaneous observations at 680 and 2900mhz in which the pulsar was not detected at 680mhz ( see table [ t : setups ] )",
    ", we can put an interesting approximate lower limit on the spectral index , @xmath20 , of the pulsar if we assume that the minimum detectable pulsed flux at 680mhz is an upper limit to the pulsed flux at this frequency :    @xmath21    such a value is extremely flat compared to that of the average population of pulsars , which has a spectral index of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "thus either psr  j1744@xmath03922  has a spectrum very different from those of most pulsars and/or the flux variability is intrinsically frequency dependent .",
    "the distribution of pulsed flux density values for all 1400 and 1950mhz observations is shown in figure [ f : histogram ] .",
    "it is clear from the distribution at 1400mhz that the numerous non - detections are responsible for the peak below the sensitivity threshold .",
    "we also observe that the 1400mhz flux density has a higher average value and is much more variable than at 1950mhz .",
    "this frequency dependence suggests some sort of scattering mechanism with the unscattered flux level much higher than the observed average flux at 1400mhz , and argues against it being classical nulling .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this unknown mechanism affecting the lower frequency flux might be responsible for the apparent flat spectrum derived from the simultaneous 680 - 2900mhz observation .",
    "recent simultaneous multi - frequency observations of psr  b1133 + 16 , a well - established nuller , show that single pulse nulls do not always happen simultaneously at all frequencies @xcite .",
    "they also observe , however , that the overall null fraction does not present any evidence of frequency dependence , which might mean that sometimes nulls are simply delayed at some frequencies . in the case of psr  j1744@xmath03922 ,",
    "the s / n limits us to consider the pulsed flux over times corresponding to many pulse periods only .",
    "therefore , the kind of non - simultaneous , frequency - dependent effect seen by @xcite is not relevant to our analysis and thus we expect the variability to be independent of frequency if really caused by nulling .",
    "although our flux measurements at other frequencies are not simultaneous , we can assume they are good statistical estimates of the normal flux of the pulsar and use them to characterize its spectrum .",
    "in an attempt to estimate an unbiased spectral index , we can use the approximate maximum flux value at each frequency .",
    "the 1400 , 1850 , 1950 , 2900 and 4600mhz data give a spectral index lying between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which is similar to many known pulsars .",
    "however , it seems that the flux at 820mhz is much smaller than expected from a single power - law spectrum .",
    "since flux variations are very important at low frequency and we only have a single detection at 820mhz , the reported maximum value is probably not representative of the real flux of the pulsar at this frequency .    in summary , the facts that the pulsar radio emission rarely drops below our detection threshold at 1950mhz and that the radio variability is frequency dependent ,",
    "demonstrate that the flux modulation is probably not classical nulling .",
    "a non - nulling origin for the fluctuations at 1400mhz also explains why psr  j1744@xmath03922  does not fit in with expectations based on the correlations observed between null fraction and spin period @xcite , and between null fraction and equivalent pulse width @xcite . in comparison with nullers",
    ", it has one of the smallest spin periods and a small pulse width ( @xmath25ms ) , but one of the largest `` null '' fractions ( @xmath26% at 1400mhz ) .",
    "since this pulsar is in a tight binary system , the possibility of influence by its companion is therefore an important alternative to consider .",
    "even though a quick examination of the time series confirms that the flux decreases observed for psr  j1744@xmath03922  are not due to systematic eclipses of the pulsar by its companion , a more subtle orbital correlation could exist .",
    "to search for such an effect , we ask whether or not the pulsar is more likely to be detected at a particular orbital phase . for this analysis",
    ", we folded the time series in 1-min intervals , and defined the pulse as detected if the best - fit gaussian amplitude was greater than its 1@xmath27 uncertainty . in order to limit spectral effects",
    ", we restrict the analysis to observations covering the range 1237.51516.5mhz at parkes and 1404.51497.5mhz at gbt .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in figure [ f : analysis]a .",
    "the histogram represents the fraction of detected pulses with respect to the total number observed , as a function of orbital phase .",
    "errors were determined using poisson statistics , implicitly assuming our assigning of each interval as a detection or non - detection is accurate .",
    "there is a suggestion that psr j1744@xmath03922 is more often undetectable between phases @xmath28 .",
    "the best - fit constant model gives a @xmath29 ( the histogram has 10 orbital phase bins ) , which , if correct , would be highly significant . to test the accuracy of our errors",
    ", we performed a monte carlo simulation consisting of 10000 trials where we assigned each measurement a random orbital phase .",
    "the mean @xmath30 with a standard deviation of 0.18 , suggesting our error estimates are significantly overestimated .    to investigate",
    "further , we performed an analysis similar to the previous one but for the pulsed flux density measured at each orbital phase averaged over all observations .",
    "we selected two subsets of data : the parkes and gbt observations made at 1400 mhz and the gbt 1950 mhz observations .",
    "the first one includes 101 observations which are on average @xmath9 minutes long , but there are a few observations which are significantly longer .",
    "the latter subset includes four observations , two of which have full orbital coverage , one covering @xmath31 of the orbit and the last one @xmath32 .",
    "observations with no detection of psr  j1744@xmath03922  are assigned upper limit values of three times the background noise level ( which is very small compared with the average pulse of the pulsar when it is on ) .",
    "errors in each bin of the histogram are estimated from the rms of the individual values in each orbital bin .",
    "results are plotted in figure [ f : analysis]b .",
    "for the 1400 mhz data , a fit to a constant line has a @xmath33 , and for the gbt 1950mhz data , we find a @xmath34 . randomizing the individual data points and folding them resulted in a @xmath35 at both frequencies , suggesting our error estimates are reasonable .",
    "although this analysis strongly rules out the constant model for our folded light curves , the shapes of these curves at 1400 and 1950mhz are not consistent with each other .",
    "this could be a result of the paucity of observations ( typically 35 ) at any given orbital phase .",
    "therefore , random fluctuations in the flux on timescales of tens of minutes ( which we see in the time series ) would likely not be averaged out . to test whether or not the significant deviation from a constant model",
    "depends on the particular phasing of our observations , we again performed monte carlo simulations in which 10000 trial histograms similar to those shown in figure [ f : analysis ] were generated from the real data by adding a random orbital phase shift at the beginning of each time series and then determining the @xmath36 value for a constant model . from the resulting distribution of @xmath36 values , we estimate the chance probability of obtaining the particular @xmath36 values obtained , or higher , using the real orbital phases .",
    "for the on - off analysis , the probability is 0.102 , or a formal @xmath37 .",
    "for the 1400 and 1950mhz flux density light curves , the probabilities are 0.015 ( @xmath38 ) and 0.212 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "this suggests there may be some correlation with the orbit , but the shape of our folded light curves are still dominated by more stochastic flux variations given our limited data set .",
    "we would expect a standard eclipse mechanism to make the pulsar dimmer when the companion is in front of it at phase 0.25 , which does not seem to be the case . there may be large orbit to orbit variations in the eclipse depths , durations , and phases .",
    "this kind of behavior has been observed in other binary pulsar systems such as ter5a , ter5p , ter5ad and ngc6397a ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for examples ) , but a much larger data set would be required to obtain a reliable average light curve to show if this is the case for psr  j1744@xmath03922 .",
    "it is still possible that the short time scale pulsed flux variations tend to group in  events \" during which the pulse gets dimmer .",
    "these  events \" may last for a significant fraction of the orbital phase causing the apparent marginal orbital correlation given our limited statistics .",
    "many other systems are known to exhibit strong flux radio variations for which the orbital dependence is well established .",
    "one of them is psr  b1718@xmath019 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this pulsar has a low - mass companion and orbital properties similar to those of psr  j1744@xmath03922  and is also harder to detect at low frequency . at 408 and 606mhz ,",
    "psr  b1718@xmath019 gets so dim that it is barely detectable in spite of good sensitivity during a large part of the orbit . on the other hand , at 1404 and 1660mhz",
    "the orbital modulation of the average flux is much less important .",
    "this flickering is probably made by material left over by the wind of the companion , a bloated main sequence ( ms ) star @xcite .",
    "although the companion of psr  b1718@xmath019 is not large enough to come near to filling its roche - lobe , this could happen in a tighter binary system like that of psr  j1744@xmath03922 . in this case , some kind of tidal stripping could be occuring , leaving material around the system .",
    "this could explain why the pulsar does not disappear at conjunction like psr  b1718@xmath019 does , but in a more stochastic way .",
    "if the companion is losing mass , one might expect to observe small changes in the orbital parameters . from radio timing",
    "( see * ? ? ?",

    ", we can express the rate of change of the semi - major axis as @xcite :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the mass of the companion and the pulsar , respectively , @xmath47 is the total angular momentum of the system , @xmath48 is the fraction of mass accreted by the pulsar and @xmath20 is the specific angular momentum of the mass lost in units of the companion star s specific angular momentum .    for the case in which the total orbital angular momentum of the system is preserved ( @xmath49 ) we can see that mass loss from the companion . ]",
    "( @xmath50 ) would necessarily lead to a widening ( @xmath51 ) of the orbit if : 1 ) the mass transfer is conservative ( @xmath52 ) , or 2 ) the mass transfer is non - conservative ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .    by considering the conservative case , in which @xmath55",
    ", we obtain an upper limit on a possible mass accretion rate by the pulsar @xmath56 .",
    "this would be even lower for the non - conservative case .",
    "accretion onto the pulsar is possible if the corotation radius :    @xmath57    is larger than the magnetospheric radius of the pulsar :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are , respectively , the spin period and the surface dipole magnetic field in units of psr  j1744@xmath03922 s @xmath11 and @xmath61 ( 172ms and @xmath62 g ) ; @xmath63 is the mass of the pulsar in units of @xmath64 ; @xmath65 is the radius of the pulsar in units of 10 km ; and @xmath66 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath67@xmath2yr@xmath18 . given the upper limit on the mass accretion rate , and the likely conservative @xmath68 value for the neutron star radius , we find that @xmath69 ( @xmath70 km ) is likely larger than @xmath71 ( @xmath72 km ) .",
    "this argues against any significant accretion occuring in the system .    that no significant accretion is occuring is also supported by an xmm - newton observation that allows @xcite to put a conservative upper limit @xmath73ergs@xmath18 on the unabsorbed x - ray flux from accretion in the 0.1 - 10kev range . assuming    @xmath74    with a conversion efficiency of accretion energy into observed x - rays @xmath75 , we get @xmath76 for accretion at the surface of the pulsar and @xmath77 if accretion is limited to the boundary of the magnetospheric radius . therefore , it appears unlikely that psr  j1744@xmath03922  is accreting and , if the companion is losing mass , it is probably expelled away from the system",

    "careful calibration of measurement errors has been done by adding artificial stars of known magnitude to blank parts of the image and then measuring their magnitude through the psf fitting process along with the real stars .",

    "these cooling tracks were made by using wd atmosphere models based on the calculations of @xcite , and thereafter improved by @xcite and @xcite , in combination with evolution sequences calculated by @xcite .",
    "although the mass range of models available to us does not go below 0.179@xmath2 , we can deduce that to be so luminous , a he wd would need to have a very low mass and a cooling age much lower than the characteristic age of the pulsar ( 1.7gyr ) .",
    "even if the mass were equal to the lower limit of 0.08@xmath2  derived from radio timing , it seems unlikely that such a companion could be as old as the pulsar characteristic age .",

    "in binary pulsar evolution , the nature of the companion plays a key role in determining the final spin and orbital characteristics of the system .",
    "most of the binary pulsar population consists of pulsars with low - mass companions in low - eccentricity orbits . following the nomenclature adopted by @xcite , the _ case a _",
    "evolutionary channel results in pulsars having he wd companions .",
    "they are neutron stars ( ns ) which were spun up to very short periods ( @xmath94ms ) after accreting matter from a low - mass star during a long and steady roche - lobe overflow ( rlo ) phase @xcite . for reasons that are not yet understood , this process is responsible for the partial suppression of the surface magnetic field to values of the order of @xmath95 g .",
    "the most robust predictions of this model are the correlations linking the orbital period to the mass of the he wd @xcite ( see figure [ f : mass_comp ] ) and the eccentricity to the orbital period @xcite .    on the other hand , the _ case b _ channel is made of pulsars having more massive co wd or onemg wd companions ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "their intermediate mass progenitors did not sustain a stable rlo phase , instead evolving in a short - duration , non - conservative , common envelope ( ce ) phase during which the pulsar spiraled into its companion s envelope .",
    "this process only partly recycled the pulsar , leading to intermediate spin periods ( @xmath97ms ) and leaving a higher magnetic field ( @xmath98 g ) .    in table",
    "[ t : comparison ] , the expected properties of systems resulting from these two evolutionary channels are compared with those of psr  j1744@xmath03922 . both scenarios fail to account for all the observed characteristics ; this suggests a special evolution for psr  j1744@xmath03922 .",
    "this can also be seen from a @xmath99 diagram ( figure [ f : recycling]a ) made for binary pulsars in the galactic field having circular orbits . as opposed to isolated and other kinds of non - recycled binary pulsars , there exists a very strong relationship linking @xmath11 and @xmath61 which is presumably related to the recycling process . to our knowledge , such a correlation has not been reported in the recent literature although was indirectly found by @xcite who reported a possible correlation between @xmath100 and @xmath101 for binary pulsars in circular orbits .",
    "the many binary pulsars discovered in recent years may be making it easier to appreciate . in figure",
    "[ f : recycling]a we see that pulsars having light companions ( _ case a _ ) generally gather in the region of low magnetic field and short spin period whereas the _ case b _ pulsars lie in higher - valued regions .",
    "surprisingly , of the six highest magnetic field pulsars , five of them , including psr  j1744@xmath03922 , have light companions .",
    "the remaining one , psr  b0655 + 64 , is an extreme system associated with the _ case b _ channel since it has a massive wd companion @xcite .",
    "however , the _ case b _ channel can not accommodate the other five pulsars because , assuming random orbital inclinations , a simple statistical estimate gives less than a 0.1% probability for all of them to be more massive than the required @xmath102 . for psr  j1744@xmath03922  in particular , the orbital inclination would need to be less than 12.5@xmath103 , which represents a 2.5% probability .",
    "we _ also _ report in table [ t : comparison ] the principal characteristics of binary pulsars that appear to be partly recycled ( e.g. @xmath104ms and @xmath105 ) but have companions likely not massive enough to be explained by the standard _ case b _ scenario .",
    "these pulsars have related properties and could have experienced similar evolutionary histories .",
    "apart from their strange position in the @xmath99 diagram , they also stand out when we look at the @xmath106 relationship ( figure [ f : recycling]b ) . in this plot",
    ", we see that pulsars having low - mass companions ( _ case a _ ) occupy the bottom region , below @xmath94ms , and their spin periods are more or less independent of the orbital period .",
    "this arises from the fact that recycling probably saturates for a given accretion rate and/or accretion mass @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "fewer constraints exist in this parameter space for pulsars with massive wd companions ( _ case b _ ) .",
    "their short ce evolution would limit the recycling efficiency and thus the final parameters are more sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "finally , we observe a third category made of relatively slow pulsars with low - mass companions in compact orbits . neither the _ case a _ nor the _ case b _ scenarios is able to explain such properties , especially for the most extreme systems like psr  j1744@xmath03922  and psr  b1831@xmath000 . therefore , we suggest a new `` class '' of binary pulsars having the following properties : 1 ) long spin periods ( in comparison to msps ) , 2 ) large surface magnetic fields ( @xmath107 g ) , 3 ) low - mass companions , likely @xmath108 , having nature yet to be determined , 4 ) low eccentricities , and possibly 5 ) short orbital periods ( @xmath109d ) . on this last point ,",
    "very wide orbit systems like psr  b1800@xmath027 and psr  j0407 + 1607 might be explained by the standard _",
    "case a _ scenario in which it is difficult to achieve an extended period of mass transfer from the companion to the pulsar .",
    "the existence of another `` class '' of binary pulsars is supported by the fact that several pulsars now occupy a region of the parameter space delimited by the spin period , orbital period , magnetic field and companion mass that seems inaccessible to the standard evolutionary channels .",
    "psrs  j1744@xmath03922 , j1232@xmath06501 , b1718@xmath019 and b1831@xmath000 are certainly the most noticeable candidates .",
    "although other papers also identified that some of these pulsars have strange characteristics ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is no consensus on their evolutionary histories .",
    "for instance the case of psr  b1718@xmath019 was considered somewhat unique because it is in a globular cluster and hence has possibly been partly perturbed , or even greatly changed , by stellar interactions @xcite .",
    "the discovery of psr  j1744@xmath03922 , in the galactic field , is important because it strengthens the possible connection between psr  b1718@xmath019 and other similar binary pulsars in the field . unless they do not have wd companions , these pulsars were at least partially recycled because tidal circularization is needed to explain eccentricities of 0.01 and smaller .",
    "however some of them have eccentricities @xmath110 , relatively large given their very short orbital periods , which is in contrast to tight _ case a _",
    "systems having smaller eccentricity @xcite . in this section we speculate and put constraints on some scenarios that may explain this possible new class of pulsars .",
    "one possibility is that pulsars like psr  j1744@xmath03922  may initially have had a magnetar - strength magnetic field ( @xmath111 g )",
    ". such a pulsar could experience standard _",
    "case a _ evolution involving conservative rlo but since the initial magnetic field is higher by 12 orders of magnitude , at the end of the recycling process , the field might be @xmath112 g instead , consistent with observations .",
    "since the recycling mechanism appears to strongly correlate the final magnetic field with the final spin period , the pulsar would also have an unusually long spin period as well .",
    "whether this extrapolation to magnetars and high magnetic field pulsars is valid depends on accretion - induced decay models of the magnetic field strength . among the proposed mechanisms is magnetic field burial , in which material accretes through the polar cap and , while piling up at the poles , exerts a latitudinal pressure gradient by trying to spread toward the equator .",
    "this effect tends to drag the field lines away from the poles , increasing the polar cap radius and decreasing the magnetic moment of the pulsar .",
    "@xcite show that the magnetic field would naturally `` freeze '' to a minimum stable strength once the amount of accreted mass exceeds some critical value , if the magnetospheric radius is comparable to the size of the neutron star .",
    "according to @xcite , this critical mass could reach up to 1@xmath2  for a @xmath113 g ns and hence magnetic field suppression would be difficult to achieve due to the large amount of accretion mass required .",
    "however , accounting for other effects like the natural decay of magnetic field due to x - ray emission and high - energy bursts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , might make a partially suppressed final magnetic field of @xmath114 g plausible .",
    "a recycled high magnetic field pulsar is expected to leave a he wd companion and follow the companion mass - orbital period relationship as for the normal _ case a _ systems .",
    "psr  b1718@xmath019 is excluded from this kind of evolution because its companion is a bloated ms star .",
    "all the other pulsars listed in table [ t : comparison ] are potential members , albeit psrs b1800@xmath027 and j0407 + 1607 would need relatively face - on orbits ( @xmath115 and @xmath116 , implying 13 and 9% probability for randomly oriented orbits , respectively ) to match the @xmath117 relationship ( fig .",
    "[ f : mass_comp ] ) . another interesting prediction of this scenario is that , because the recycling process can leave pulsars with relatively long spin periods , they might not be very different from the spin periods when accretion ceased .",
    "thus , the real age could be much lower than the timing - based characteristic age , and the wd companions would have younger cooling ages as well .",
    "the fraction of galactic field binary pulsars in this class ( @xmath917/60 ) might naively be thought to be similar to the fraction of observed magnetars with respect to the ordinary pulsars ( @xmath9110/1500 ) .",
    "however , the observed population of magnetars suffers from severe selection effects because many of them appear to lie dormant , becoming observable for only brief intervals , like xte  j1810@xmath0197 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can relate these parameters as follows :    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is the number of pulsars in the new class , @xmath120 is the number of binary pulsar systems , @xmath121 is the number of observed magnetars , @xmath122 is the number of radio pulsars and @xmath123 the fraction of magnetars in quiescence .",
    "hence we estimate that , due to quiescence , the fraction of observed magnetars with respect to the total population is about @xmath124 .",
    "this would make a total population of @xmath125 magnetars which is consistent with the possible @xmath126 in our galaxy estimated by @xcite , who used @xmath127 .",
    "our crude calculation has many caveats : is the binary magnetar population similar to the binary radio pulsar population ? can the short lifetime of magnetars and high magnetic field neutron stars limit the number of such recycled systems ? clearly , this latter point depends strongly on the time evolution of the self - induced decay of the magnetic field , which seems to operate on a time scale of a few tens of thousands of years @xcite .",
    "there exists a class of neutron stars and co / onemg wds that accrete from light he wd donors in ultra tight ( few tens of minutes ) orbits .",
    "these x - ray emitters , known as ultracompact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ) , may be the result of wider @xmath128-day systems that have decayed due to gravitational wave radiation .",
    "a ce scenario has been proposed as a viable channel for forming co / onemg wd  he wd and ns  he wd systems @xcite .",
    "in fact such a channel would be very similar to the _ case b _ scenario but for an initially much lighter companion . for companions not massive enough to experience the he flash ,",
    "a ce phase is possible if the onset of mass transfer occurs late enough in the evolution so that the companion has reached the asymptotic giant branch . in this case , the rlo becomes unstable and it bifurcates from the standard _ case a _ track to the ce phase .",
    "pulsars experiencing this evolution would be partially recycled , like _ case b _",
    "systems , but they would have he wd companions . after this stage ,",
    "only sufficiently tight systems with orbital periods of about one hour or less can evolve to become ucxbs within a hubble time because gravitational decay is negligible for wider orbits .",
    "if psr  j1744@xmath03922-like pulsars belong to the long orbital separation high - end of the ucxb formation channel , we might expect to see more such pulsars at similar and smaller orbital separations than psr  j1744@xmath03922 .",
    "it is possible , however , that the observed sample is biased : as the orbital separation decreases , wind and mass loss by the companion become more important and would make them more difficult to detect in classical pulsar surveys conducted at low frequency ( i.e. @xmath91400mhz ) where eclipses are more frequent and radio emission might simply turn off . the ongoing alfa survey at arecibo , at 1400mhz @xcite , could therefore find several new pulsars like psr  j1744@xmath03922 .",
    "additionally , larger orbital accelerations make them more difficult to find and , since gravitational wave radiation varies as the fourth power of the orbital separation , their lifetimes are dramatically shorter .    in such a scenario ,",
    "these pulsars might be born at a spin period that is comparable with those of _",
    "case b _ pulsars having co wd companions , assuming that the short , high - accretion rate recycling would efficiently screen the magnetic field during the mass transfer process . afterwards , because of their relatively larger magnetic field , they would spin down more rapidly than _ case b _ pulsars .",
    "thus , they would necessarily have longer spin periods and the true age is more likely to be in agreement with the measured characteristic age .      finally , a third scenario to explain the unusual properties of psr  j1744@xmath03922  is the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of a massive onemg wd into a ns .",
    "most likely aic progenitors would be massive onemg wds ( @xmath129 ) accreting from ms donors in cv - like systems , or from red giants or he wds in ucxb systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "@xcite have shown that for accretion rates @xmath130 and/or metal - rich accreted mass , the onemg wd would collapse to a ns rather than explode in a supernova .",
    "more recent calculations including coulomb corrections to the equation of state by @xcite demonstrate that aic is possible for critical densities of the accreting wd core that are @xmath131 lower than previously found by @xcite , thus facilitating the formation of neutron stars through this channel .",
    "the properties predicted by the aic scenario nicely agree with what we observe for the class we are proposing : the mass transfer prior to the ns formation would explain the low mass of the companion and the collapse is expected to be a quiet event during which almost no mass is lost in the system and only @xmath132 is converted in binding energy into the ns .",
    "this would keep the final orbital period close to what it was prior to the collapse ( which is small in most scenarios leading to aic ) and allow the eccentricity to be very small or , at least , circularize rapidly .",
    "the survival rate of such systems is probably higher than for standard systems which are more likely to be disrupted if a large amount of mass is lost during the supernova process .",
    "although the initial properties of pulsars formed by aic are not known , we may presume they resemble those of `` normal '' pulsars with magnetic fields in the @xmath133 g range . another interesting point to consider",
    "is that the aic channel does not require a degenerate companion .",
    "as opposed to the other two proposed scenarios ( sections [ s : magnetar ] and [ s : ucxb ] ) , the formation of a pulsar through aic can interrupt the mass transfer , thus postponing further evolution .",
    "if the `` evolutionary quiescence '' is long enough , we would expect to find some non - degenerate companions around young aic pulsars having circular orbits but with spin periods and magnetic fields that are more typical of isolated pulsars . finally ,",
    "as the companion continues to evolve to fill its now larger roche lobe , a shortened accretion phase might occur , thus transfering a very small amount of mass to the pulsar and leaving it partly recycled despite its low - mass companion .",
    "some binary pulsars among the group we highlighted , like psrs b1831@xmath000 and b1718@xmath019 , have been proposed as aic candidates in the past @xcite .",
    "however , there is no firm evidence to support this .",
    "for instance , psr  b1718@xmath019 is presumably a member of the globular cluster ngc  6342 . as @xcite show , although observations suggest aic is possible , an encounter and tidal capture scenario can not be ruled out and is very reasonable given the plausible globular cluster association . on the other hand , psr  b1718@xmath019 shares similarities with other binary pulsars in the galactic field , especially with psr  j1744@xmath03922 .",
    "psr  b1718@xmath019 s younger age , larger magnetic field and spin period , as well as the fact that it has a non - degenerate companion , are all compatible with it being an aic pulsar in the intermediate `` quiescent '' phase .    in this context",
    ", the other pulsars of our putative class would have reached the final evolutionary stage and , hence , display mildly recycled properties .",
    "if so , psr  j1744@xmath03922  likely has a very light he wd companion .",
    "this might explain the lack of traditional eclipses as in psr  b1718@xmath019 @xcite , large dm variations as in ngc  6397a @xcite , and orbital period derivatives as in other compact binary pulsars @xcite since tidal effects are important for non - degenerate companions .",
    "if the residual recycling phase left psr  j1744@xmath03922  with a long spin period , the cooling age of its hypothetical wd companion could be smaller than the characteristic age of the pulsar for the same reason described in the recycled high magnetic field pulsar scenario ( see section [ s : magnetar ] ) .",
    "also , pulsars forming through aic can have lower masses than those made in standard supernovae and since they only accrete a small amount of mass from their companion afterwards , they might be less massive than conventionally formed msps .",
    "this paper highlights the unusual nature of the binary pulsar system psr  j1744@xmath03922 .",
    "the puzzling radio flux modulation that it exhibits does not show typical nulling properties as displayed by some old isolated pulsars ; specifically , we have found strong evidence that its variation is highly frequency dependent .",
    "although our orbital modulation analysis does not show a significant correlation between orbital phase and flux , the modulation could still be caused by a process related to a wind from its companion , which results in short time scale variations grouped in extreme modulation `` events '' .",
    "additional monitoring of both the pulsar and of its companion may prove useful in this regard .",
    "we pointed out that this pulsar has an unusual combination of characteristics : long spin period , very low - mass companion , high magnetic field and short orbital period , that are unexplained by standard binary pulsar evolution scenarios .",
    "we propose that psr  j1744@xmath03922 , along with a several other binary pulsar systems , are part of a new class of low - mass binary pulsars which failed to be fully recyled .",
    "specifically , we suggest three alternative scenarios for this class of binary pulsars . distinguishing among them may be possible by improving our knowledge of the nature of their companions .",
    "we also reported the detection of a possible near - infrared counterpart to psr  j1744@xmath03922 s companion , however , determining its nature will require detailed near - infrared / optical follow - up .    r.p.b .",
