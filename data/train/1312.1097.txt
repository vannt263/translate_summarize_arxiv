    "we consider solving the laplace - beltrami problem on a smooth two dimensional surface embedded into a three dimensional space partitioned into a mesh consisting of shape regular tetrahedra .",
    "the mesh does not respect the surface and thus the surface cuts through the elements .",
    "following olshanskii , reusken , and grande @xcite we construct a galerkin method by using the restrictions of continuous piecewise linears defined on the tetrahedra to the surface .    the resulting discrete method may be severely ill - conditioned and the main purpose of this paper is to suggest a remedy for this problem based on adding a consistent stabilization term to the original bilinear form .",
    "the stabilization term we consider here controls jumps in the normal gradient on the faces of the tetrahedra and provides a certain control of the derivative of the discrete functions in the direction normal to the surface .",
    "similar terms have recently been used for stabilization of cut finite element methods for fictitious domain methods @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . note",
    "that none of these references involve any partial differential equations on surfaces only regular boundary and interface conditions .    in principle , it is possible , in this situation , to deal with the ill conditioning problem in the linear algebra using a scaling , see @xcite .",
    "starting from a stable method has clear advantages in more complex applications that may need stabilization anyway , such as problems with hyperbolic character or coupled bulk - surface problems .",
    "it is also not clear that matrix based algebraic scaling procedures is possible in all situations and thus alternative approaches must be investigated .    using the additional stability we first prove an optimal estimate for the condition number , independent of the location of the surface , in terms of the mesh size of the underlying tetrahedra .",
    "the key step in the proof is certain discrete poincar estimates that are also of general interest .",
    "then we prove a priori error estimates in the energy and @xmath0 norms .    in a companion paper",
    ", we will consider the more challenging problems of the surface helmholtz equation and show error estimates for a stabilized method under a suitable condition on the product of the mesh size and the wave number .",
    "finally , we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for general background on finite element methods for partial differential equations on surfaces .",
    "the outline of the reminder of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we formulate the model problem and the finite element method , in section 3 we summarize some preliminary results involving lifting of functions from the discrete surface to the continuous surface , in section 4 we prove an optimal bound on the condition number of the stabilized method , in section 5 we prove a priori error estimates in the energy and @xmath0 norms , and finally in section 6 we present numerical investigations confirming our theoretical results .",
