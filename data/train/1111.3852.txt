    "one of the oldest and most important problems in galactic dynamics is the determination of the mass distribution based on the observations of the circular velocity or rotation curve @xcite , defined as the speed of the stars moving in the galactic plane in circular orbits around the center .",
    "now , if we assume a particular model for the composition of the galaxy , the fit of that model with the rotation curve of a particular galaxy can , in principle , completely determine the distribution of mass .",
    "so then , the rotation curve provides the most direct method to measure the distribution of mass of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "currently , the most accepted description of the composition of spiral galaxies is that a significant portion of its mass is concentrated in a thin disc , while the other contributions to the total mass of the galaxy comes from a spherical halo of dark matter , a central bulge and , perhaps , a central black hole @xcite .",
    "now , since all components contribute to the gravitational field of the galaxy , obtaining appropriate models that include the effects of all parts is a problem of great difficulty .",
    "however , the contribution of each part is limited to certain distance scales , so in a reasonably realistic model is not necessary to include the contribution of all components @xcite .    in particular , the gravitational influence of the central black hole",
    "is appreciable only within a few parsecs around the center of the galaxy @xcite , so it can be completely neglected when studying the dynamics in the disc , or in regions outside the central bulge , while the bulge mainly dominates the inner region of the galaxy to a few kiloparsec .",
    "so then , the main contributions to the gravitational field of the galaxy come from the galactic disc and the dark matter halo @xcite . however , it is commonly accepted that many aspects of galactic dynamics can be described , in a fairly approximate way , using models that consider only the contribution of a thin galactic disc @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the study of the gravitational potential generated by an idealized thin disc is a problem of great astrophysical relevance and so , through the years , different approaches have been used to obtain such kind of thin disc models ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so , once an expression for the gravitational potential has been derived , corresponding expressions for the surface mass density of the disc and for the circular velocity of the disc particles can be obtained .",
    "then , if the expression for the circular velocity can be adjusted to fit the observational data of the rotation curve of a particular galaxy , the total mass can be obtained by integrating the corresponding surface mass density .    however , although most of these thin disc models have surface densities and rotation curves with remarkable properties , many of them mainly represent discs of infinite extension and thus they are rather poor flat galaxy models . therefore , in order to obtain more realistic models of flat galaxies , is better to consider methods that permit obtaining finite thin disc models .",
    "now , a simple method to obtain the gravitational potential , the surface density and the rotation curve of thin discs of finite radius was developed by @xcite , the simplest example of a disc obtained by this method being the well known @xcite disc .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite we use the hunter method in order to obtain an infinite family of thin discs of finite radius with a well behaved surface mass density .",
    "this family of disc models was derived by requiring that the surface density behaves as a monotonously decreasing function of the radius , with a maximum at the center of the disc and vanishing at the edge .",
    "furthermore , the motion of test particles in the gravitational fields generated by the first four members of this family was studied in @xcite .",
    "so , although the mass distribution of this family of discs presents a satisfactory behaviour in such a way that they could be considered adequate as flat galaxy models , their corresponding rotation curves do not present a so good behavior as they do not reproduce the flat region of the observed rotation curve .    on the other hand , in @xcite a new family of discs",
    "was obtained as a superposition of members of the previously obtained family , by requiring that the surface density be expressed as a well behaved function of the gravitational potential , in such a way that the corresponding distribution functions can be easily obtained .",
    "furthermore , besides presenting a well - behaved surface density , the models also presented rotation curves with a better behavior than the generalized kalnajs discs .",
    "however , although these discs are stable against small radial perturbations of disc star orbits , they are unstable to small perturbations vertical to the disc plane . then , apart of the stability problems , these discs can be considered as quite adequate models in order to describe satisfactorily a great variety of galaxies .",
    "based on these works , in @xcite were obtained some thin disc models in which the circular velocities were adjusted to very accurately fit the observed rotation curves of four spiral galaxies of the ursa major cluster , galaxies ngc3877 , ngc3917 , ngc3949 and ngc4010 . these models presented well behaved surface densities and the obtained values for the corresponding total mass it agrees with the expected order of magnitude . however , the models presented a central region with strong instability to small vertical perturbations .",
    "now , this result was expected as a consequence of the fact that the models only consider the thin galactic disc .",
    "therefore , more realistic models must be considered that include the non - thin character of the galactic disc or the mass contribution of the spheroidal halo .    in agreement with the above considerations , in this paper we will consider a family of models obtained by expressing the gravitational potential as the superposition of a potential generated by the thin galactic disc and a potential generated by the spheroidal halo , in such a way that the model implies a linear relationship between the masses of the thin disc and the spheroidal halo . by adjusting the corresponding expression for the circular velocity to the observed data of the rotation curve of some specific galaxies ,",
    "some particular models will be analysed . then , from the corresponding expressions for the disc surface density and the density of the halo , estimate values for the total mass of the disc and the total mass of the halo will be obtained .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "first , in section 2 , we present the thin disc plus halo model .",
    "then , in section 3 , we obtain the corresponding expressions for particular models and , in section 4 , the models are fitted to data of the observed rotation curve of some galaxies of the ursa mayor cluster , as reported in @xcite . finally , in section 5",
    ", we discuss the obtained results .",
    "in order to obtain galaxy models consisting of a thin galactic disc and a spheroidal halo , we begin considering an axially symmetric gravitational potential @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are the usual cylindrical coordinates . also , besides the axial symmetry , we suppose that the potential has symmetry of reflection with respect to the plane @xmath2 , @xmath3 which implies that the normal derivative of the potential satisfies the relation @xmath4 in agreement with the attractive character of the gravitational field .",
    "we also assume that @xmath5 does not vanish on the plane @xmath2 , in order to have a thin distribution of matter that represents the disc .    on the other hand , in order to separately describe the thin disc and the spheroidal halo , we consider that the gravitational potential can be written as the superposition of two independent components @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the part of the potential generated by the thin galactic disc , while @xmath8 corresponds to the spheroidal halo component .",
    "the disc component @xmath7 must be a solution of the laplace equation everywhere outside the disc , @xmath9 while the halo component @xmath8 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mass density of the halo .",
    "so , given a potential @xmath12 with the previous properties , we can easily obtain the circular velocity @xmath13 , defined as the velocity of the stars moving at the galactic disc in circular orbits around the center , through the relationship @xmath14 while the surface mass density @xmath15 of the thin galactic disc is given by @xmath16 which it is obtained by using the gauss law and the reflection symmetry of @xmath12 .",
    "accordingly , in order that the potential of the spheroidal halo does not contribute to the disc surface density , we will impose the condition @xmath17 furthermore , in order to have a surface density corresponding to a finite disclike distribution of matter , we impose boundary conditions in the form    @xmath18    in such a way that the matter distribution is restricted to the disc @xmath2 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the radius of the disc .    in order to properly pose the boundary value problem ,",
    "we introduce the oblate spheroidal coordinates , whose symmetry adapts in a natural way to the geometry of the model .",
    "these coordinates are related to the usual cylindrical coordinates by the relation ( @xcite @xcite )    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the disc has the coordinates @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "on crossing the disc , the @xmath26 coordinate changes sign but does not change in absolute value .",
    "the singular behaviour of this coordinate implies that an even function of @xmath26 is a continuous function everywhere but has a discontinuous @xmath26 derivative at the disc .",
    "now , in terms of the oblate spheroidal coordinates , the laplace operator acting over any axially symmetric function @xmath27 gives @xmath28_{,\\xi } + \\left[(1 - \\eta^{2 } ) \\phi_{,\\eta } \\right]_{,\\eta}}{a^2 ( \\xi^2 + \\eta^2 ) } , \\label{lapop}\\ ] ] whereas the boundary condition ( [ cond1 ] ) is equivalent to    @xmath29    and the boundary conditions ( [ cond2 ] ) and ( [ cond3 ] ) reduce to    @xmath30    moreover , in order that the gravitational potential be continuous everywhere , @xmath31 must be an even function of @xmath26 , which grants also the fulfilment of conditions ( [ cond1b ] ) and ( [ cond2b ] ) .",
    "accordingly , by imposing the previous boundary conditions over the general solution of the laplace equation in oblate spheroidal coordinates , we can write the gravitational potential of the galactic disc as ( @xcite @xcite ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a positive integer , which it defines the model of disc considered . here",
    "@xmath34 are the usual legendre polynomials and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the legendre functions of second kind ( see @xcite @xcite and , for the legendre functions of imaginary argument , @xcite @xcite , page 1328 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath37 are , in principle , arbitrary constants , but which must be specified to obtain any particular model .",
    "we will do this after , by adjusting the circular velocity of the model with the observed data of the rotation curve of some specific galaxies .    with this expression for the gravitational potential of the disc ,",
    "the surface density is given by @xmath38 where , as @xmath39 , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "then , by integrating on the total area of the disc , we find the value @xmath42 for the total mass of the disc .",
    "now , it is clear that the surface density diverges at the disc edge , when @xmath43 , unless that we impose the condition ( @xcite @xcite ) @xmath44 that , after using the identities    @xmath45    which are easily obtained from the properties of the legendre functions , leads to the expression @xmath46 which gives , through ( [ masa ] ) , the value of the dics mass @xmath47 in terms of the constants @xmath37 , with @xmath48 .",
    "now , to properly choose the gravitational potential of the spheroidal halo , first we consider the product functions @xmath49 where ( @xcite @xcite ) @xmath50 are the solutions of the differential equation @xmath51 = \\left[j(j+1 ) - \\frac{k^2}{1 + \\xi^2}\\right ] q_{j}^{k } ( \\xi ) , \\label{dqjk}\\ ] ] while the associated legendre functions ( @xcite @xcite ) , @xmath52 are the solutions of the differential equation @xmath53 = \\left[\\frac{k^2}{1 - \\eta^2 } - j(j+1)\\right ] p_{j}^{k } ( \\eta ) , \\label{dpjk}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are integers , with @xmath56 .    with the previous expressions , and using the laplace operator ( [ lapop ] ) , we can now compute the mass density associated with a gravitational potential given by @xmath57 .",
    "thus , from the poisson equation ( [ posec ] ) , we obtain @xmath58 with @xmath59 , while the density is identically zero when @xmath60 .",
    "then , as @xmath61 is finite at the interval @xmath62 and @xmath63 goes to zero when @xmath64 , @xmath65 properly vanishes at infinity . on the other hand , from ( [ pjk ] )",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath65 diverges at @xmath66 ( the @xmath67 axis ) unless that @xmath68 , while for @xmath69 this function vanishes at @xmath70 .",
    "on the other hand , due to the discontinuous character of @xmath26 , @xmath71 will be continuous across the disc only if @xmath72 is an even number , since then @xmath61 will be an even function of @xmath26 .    in agreement with the above considerations",
    ", we will take for the gravitational potential of the spheroidal a simple combination of the product functions @xmath57 given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are , in principle , arbitrary constants . then , after using the explicit expressions for @xmath63 and @xmath77 , the halo density can be written as @xmath78 which is maximum at the disc surface , when @xmath39 , and then fastly decreases being constant at the oblate spheroids defined by @xmath79 . by integrating over all the space , we obtain the expression @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the total mass of the halo .",
    "finally , from the condition ( [ cond1a ] ) , we obtain    @xmath82    and so all the constants in ( [ potenh ] ) are expressed in terms of the halo mass @xmath81 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we restrict to particles moving in the thin disc , the circular velocity ( [ vc2 ] ) is written in terms of the spheroidal coordinates as @xmath83 which , by using ( [ poten ] ) , ( [ potend ] ) , ( [ potenh ] ) and the properties of the legendre functions , reduces to @xmath84 where @xmath85 , \\label{c2til}\\ ] ] and @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "then , by using ( [ constant0 ] ) , ( [ c2til ] ) and ( [ c2ltil ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath88 and thus the model implies a linear relationship between @xmath89 and @xmath81 , in which the independent term is determined by the constants @xmath90 , with @xmath48 .",
    "now , it is clear that the above relationship makes sense only if the right hand side it is positive , which should be checked for every set of constants @xmath90 corresponding to any particular model .",
    "in order to obtain particular models , we must to specify the constants @xmath90 of the general model .",
    "so , we will adjust these constants in such a way that the circular velocity @xmath91 it fits the data of the rotation curve of some particular galaxy . now , as expression ( [ vcsph ] ) for the circular velocity only involves derivatives of the legendre polynomials of even order , it is equivalent to @xmath92 where the @xmath93 constants are related with the previous constants @xmath90 , for @xmath94 , through the relation @xmath95 where @xmath96 which is obtained by equaling expressions ( [ vcsph ] ) and ( [ velr2n ] ) and by using the orthogonality properties of the associated legendre functions ( @xcite @xcite ) .    then",
    ", if the constants @xmath93 are determined by a fitting of the observational data of the corresponding rotation curve , the corresponding values of the coefficients @xmath90 can be determined by means of relation ( [ relation ] ) , obtaining then a particular case of ( [ linear ] ) corresponding to a specific galaxy model , which can be written in terms of the constants @xmath93 as @xmath97 however , this relation does not determine completely the values of @xmath89 and @xmath81 , only gives a linear relationship between them .",
    "so , in order to restrict the allowed values of these masses , it is needed to analyse the behaviour of some other quantities characterizing the kinematics of the model .",
    "besides the circular velocity , two other important quantities concerning the kinematics of the models are the epicycle or radial frequency , @xmath98 , and the vertical frequency , @xmath99 , which describe the stability against radial and vertical perturbations of particles in quasi - circular orbits ( @xcite @xcite , section 2.2.3 , page 164 ) . these two quantities , which must be positive in order to have stable circular orbits , are defined as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the effective potential and @xmath102 is the specific axial angular momentum .",
    "then , by using expression ( [ vc2 ] ) for the circular velocity , we can write the above expressions as @xmath103 where we also used the expression for the laplace operator in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "now , by using ( [ velr2n ] ) , the epicycle frequency can be cast as @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "so , as the epicycle frequency is completely determined by the set of constants @xmath93 , which are fixed by the numerical fit of the rotation curve data , there are not free parameters that can be adjusted by requiring radial stability .",
    "however , relation ( [ kapr2n ] ) can be used as a consistency criterion to the numerical fit of the circular velocity with the observed data of the rotation curve .",
    "so , if the epicycle frequency it is not positive everywhere at the interval @xmath106 for a given set of constants , it is possible to make a new numerical fit by considering a different model , with another value of @xmath33 , in order to ensure the positiveness of the epicycle frequency .",
    "accordingly , we seek for a balance between the best numerical fit and the numerical fit that agrees with the positiveness of the epicycle frequency .    also , by using the poisson equation ( [ posec ] ) , the expression ( [ denh ] ) for the halo density and the expression ( [ velr2n ] ) for the circular velocity , the vertical frequency can be written as @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 so , as @xmath110 must be positive everywhere at the interval @xmath106 in order to have vertically stable models , expression ( [ nur2n ] ) defines a lower bound for the halo mass , @xmath111 that combined with ( [ lineara2n ] ) gives also an upper bound for the disc mass @xmath89 .",
    "we also need to consider the behavior of the surface mass density , as given by expression ( [ density ] ) , that can be written in terms of the constants @xmath93 as @xmath112 where , for the model with @xmath113 , @xmath114 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left [ \\frac{16 a_4}{9 } + \\frac{64 a_6}{75 } + \\frac{768 a_8}{1225 } \\right ] { \\widetilde r}^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left [ \\frac{128 a_6}{75 } + \\frac{1024 a_8}{1225 } \\right ] { \\widetilde r}^4 + \\left [ \\frac{2048 a_8}{1225 } \\right ] { \\widetilde r}^6 , \\label{f2a2n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for any other value of @xmath33 the explicit expression of @xmath115 can be easily obtained from ( [ density ] ) , ( [ c2til ] ) , ( [ c2ltil ] ) and ( [ relation ] ) .",
    "accordingly , in order that the surface mass density be positive everywhere on the disc , expression ( [ dena2n ] ) defines an upper bound for the halo mass , @xmath116 that combined with ( [ lineara2n ] ) gives also a lower bound for the disc mass @xmath89 .",
    "however , in order that the models make sense , we must have that @xmath117 which should be checked for every set of constants corresponding to any particular model .",
    "in order to check the applicability of the previous model to describe real galaxies , we analyse a set data taken from the recent paper by @xcite , in which are reported the results of an extensive 21 cm - line synthesis imaging survey of 43 galaxies in the nearby ursa major cluster using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope . for each rotation curve data",
    ", we take the value of @xmath20 , the radius of the galactic disc , as given by the last tabulated value of the radius . accordingly",
    ", we are assuming that the radius of the galaxies is defined by the farthest observed data .",
    "now , although this assumption about the galactic radius do not agrees with the accepted standard about the edge of the stellar disc ( @xcite @xcite ) , we will make it since we are assuming that all the stars moving in circular orbits at the galactic plane are inside the disc and that there are no stars moving outside the disc .",
    "so , by taking the radius normalized in units of @xmath20 , we make a non - linear least square fit of the data with the general relation ( [ velr2n ] ) for all the galaxies reported by @xcite , seeking for a balance between the best numerical fit and the fit that agrees with the positiveness of the epicycle frequency by using the consistency criterion ( [ kapr2n ] ) over the constants @xmath93 . by selecting between all the galaxies only those that fulfill with the consistency criterion",
    ", then we proceed to determine the lower and upper bounds over the halo mass by using expressions ( [ mhmin ] ) and ( [ mhmax ] ) .",
    "finally , we check that this two values of the halo mass are in agreement with the condition ( [ mascon ] ) in order that the models make sense .",
    "however , when we check the consistency of the adjust , we found that only the fit of the data for the galaxies ngc4389 and ugc6969 it agrees with this conditions , whereas that for all the other galaxies we found that @xmath118 .    .halo",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    in table [ tab : a2l ] we present the values of the galactic radius @xmath20 and the constants @xmath93 obtained by the numerical adjust with the rotation curve data for galaxies ngc4389 and ugc6969 by taking a model with @xmath113 . with this values for the constants ,",
    "we obtain for the galaxy ngc4389 the relationship @xmath121 and for the galaxy ugc6969 the relationship @xmath122 we also compute the minimum and maximum values of the halo mass @xmath81 , the disc mass @xmath89 and the total mass @xmath119 , defined as @xmath123 so , in table [ tab : maskg ] , we present the values for the halo mass , the disc mass and the total mass in @xmath124 , whereas that in table [ tab : masmo ] we present the corresponding values in solar mass units @xmath120 .    in fig .",
    "[ veloc ] , we show the adjusted rotation curve for these two galaxies .",
    "the upper plot corresponds to the model for galaxy ngc4389 , while the lower plot to the model for galaxy ugc6969 .",
    "the points with error bars are the observations as reported in @xcite , while the solid line are the rotation curves determined from ( [ velr2n ] ) with @xmath113 , and the @xmath93 given by the numerical fit . as we can see , with the two galaxies we get a fairly accurate numerical adjustment to the rotation curve .",
    "we also plot , in fig .",
    "[ epici ] , the epicycle frequency for the two galaxies , and we can see that this quantity is always positive in both of them .    @xmath125    @xmath126    in fig .",
    "[ verti ] we present the vertical frequency for the two models , the model for galaxy ngc4389 in the upper plot and the model for galaxy ugc6969 in the lower plot . in both of the models we plot the vertical frequency for the minimum value @xmath127 of the halo mass ( upper curve of each plot ) and the maximum value @xmath128 of the halo mass ( lower curve of each plot ) . as we can see , for the two galaxies we obtain a positive vertical frequency for all the disc extension , so the models are stable against vertical perturbations .",

    "[ densi ] , we present the corresponding plots of the surface mass density for the two galaxies , again with the model for galaxy ngc4389 in the upper plot and the model for galaxy ugc6969 in the lower plot , plotting the surface mass density for the same two values of the halo mass as in the plots of the vertical frequency . for galaxy ngc4389 ,",
    "the density has a maximum at the disc centre and then decreases as @xmath129 increases , vanishing at the disc edge . on the other hand , for galaxy ugc6969 the density behaves in a similar way , having a maximum at the disc centre and then decreasing , presenting then a small region where the density remains almost constant and then decreasing again to vanish at the disc edge .",
    "furthermore , as with the vertical frequency , for galaxy ugc6969 the two curves are almost coincident again as a consequence of the narrow interval between the two values of the halo mass .",
    "@xmath130    @xmath131",
    "we presented a family of galactic models characterised by a linear relationship between the halo mass and the disc mass .",
    "the models are stable against radial and vertical perturbations and their circular velocities can be adjusted very accurately to the observed rotation curves of some specific galaxies .",
    "the here presented models are a generalisation of the models presented in @xcite , where we only considered models with a thin galactic disc .",
    "the generalisation was obtained by adding to the gravitational potential of the thin disc the gravitational potential corresponding to a spheroidal halo , in such a way that we solve the problem of vertical unstability presented by the previous models .",
    "two particular models were obtained by a numerical fit of the general expression ( [ velr2n ] ) for the circular velocity with the observed data of the rotation curve of galaxies ngc4389 and ugc6969 .",
    "for these two galaxies we obtained a fairly accurate numerical adjustment with the rotation curve and , from the constants @xmath93 obtained with the numerical fit , we compute the values of the halo mass , the disc mass and the total mass for these two galaxies in such a way that we obtain a very narrow interval of values for these quantities . furthermore , the values of masses here obtained are in perfect agreement with the expected order of magnitude and with the relative order of magnitude between the halo mass and the disc mass .",
    "however , although we tested the applicability of the present model with all the galaxies reported by @xcite , consistent models were obtained only for the two galaxies ngc4389 and ugc6969 , whereas for all the other galaxies were obtained models with values of the halo mass such that @xmath132 .",
    "now , this negative result can be considered as due to the simple halo model that we have taken here . indeed , as we can see from expressions ( [ rhokj ] ) and ( [ potenh ] ) , only one term of the gravitational potential of the halo contributes to their density , what leaves only one free constant to be determined in order to fit the model to the imposed consistency conditions .",
    "this constant is precisely the mass of the halo , @xmath133 , which is determined by requiring the positiveness of the vertical frequency and the surface mass density . on the other hand , by considering additional terms in expression ( [ potenh ] ) for the halo potential , we will have new free parameters that perhaps allow to adjust the model to properly describe the behavior of other galaxies besides the two considered here .    in agreement with the above considerations , we can consider the simple set of models here presented as a fairly good approximation to obtaining quite realistic models of galaxies . in particular",
    ", we believe that the values of mass obtained for the two galaxies here studied may be taken as a very accurate estimate of the upper and lower bounds for the mass of the galactic disc and for the mass of the spheroidal halo in these two galaxies .",
    "accordingly , we are now working on a more involved model , obtained by including additional terms in expression ( [ potenh ] ) for the halo potential , in order to get some particular models that can be properly adjusted with the observed data of the rotation curve of some other galaxies besides the two here considered .",
