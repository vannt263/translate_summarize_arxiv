    "the study of transport through mesoscopic multiply connected geometries containing one or two quantum dots ( qd s ) has recently attracted much interest . for devices smaller than the phase - coherence length , aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations , i.e. , oscillations of the conductance as a function of magnetic flux appear . this has been experimentally demonstrated for ab interferometers with either one qd,@xcite or with 2 qds.@xcite    theoretical discussions of ab interferometry with qd s can be divided into two groups .",

    ", the total transmission through the device can be derived.@xcite    the virtue of the tunneling picture lies in the fact that many - body effects , e.g. , due to coulomb interaction in the qd s , can be included in a conceptually straightforward way . on the other hand , in the scattering - matrix approach",
    "the effect of orbital phases associated with the finite length of the arms of the ab interferometer can be discussed in an easy manner .",
    "a question of great importance is how these two types of models are connected to each other , and , in particular , to a given experimental setup .",
    "do they capture different physical aspects ? at first glance , they seem to describe different geometries , i.e. , not to be related to each other at all . in geometries depicted in fig .",

    "in contrast , multiple - loop trajectories around the enclosed flux in fig .",
    "[ fig0]a ) go through the left and right lead .",
    "one might even argue naively that in the latter case the multiple - loop trajectories can not contribute to coherent transport , and thus to ab oscillations , since the electrons entering the leads would loose their phase information immediately .",
    "this notion , however , turns out not to be correct , as we discuss in detail below .        to compare the two models we concentrate on situations in which both approaches are applicable . as a first condition",
    ", we assume the coulomb interaction among the electrons in the qd s to be negligible . in this case",
    ", the transmission amplitudes through the qd s , which are essential input parameters for the scattering - matrix approach , are easily determined .",
    "( for the problems arising with interacting electrons see the discussion in refs .  .",
    ") secondly , we neglect orbital phases associated with a finite length of the interferometers arms .",
    "we will find that , in complete contrast to the naive expectation formulated above , both , the model based on the scattering - matrix formulation and that being described by a tunneling hamiltonian , capture the very same physical aspects .",
    "in fact , we explicitly show ( for ab interferometers containing one or two qd s ) that both models are even _ equivalent _ , i.e. , they yield the same total transmission through the device .",
    "this equivalence is even more surprising when realizing that the scattering - matrix models seem , at first glance , to have an additional model parameter which does not enter the tunneling hamiltonian .",
    "this parameter is the strength of the coupling between the ab ring and the leads .",
    "we will resolve this puzzle for the ab interferometers with one or two qd s studied in this paper by explicitly deriving scaling relations which demonstrate that different ring - lead coupling strengths can be rescaled by modified tunnel couplings of qd levels .    while the ring - lead coupling strength does not introduce an extra dimension for the space of adjustable parameters , the orbital phase associated with the finite length of the ab interferometers arms does . in the last part of this paper ,",
    "we study how the orbital and the ab phase affect transport through a double - dot ab interferometer .",
    "we derive an expression for the total transmission under the neglect of coulomb interactions in the qd s .",
    "the result is a generalization of ref .  , where , using a tunneling - hamiltonian approach , we analyzed the transport features in the absence of orbital phases .",
    "we consider an ab interferometer containing two single - level qd s with level energies @xmath0 and @xmath1 , measured relative to the fermi energy of the leads .",
    "the corresponding tunnel hamiltonian reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the creation and annihilation operators for electrons with quantum number @xmath5 in the left or right lead , @xmath6 or @xmath7 , respectively , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the fermi operators for the states in dot @xmath10 .",
    "the ab flux @xmath11 enclosed by the interferometer arms enters the hamiltonian via phase - dependent tunnel matrix elements @xmath12 . in a symmetric gauge the latter can be written as @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 .    in our previous work@xcite",
    "we have analyzed the transport characteristics of the present model in detail . here , our goal is the comparison to the scattering - matrix formalism .",

    "we assume a symmetric geometry of the fork , i.e. , symmetry between the two channels @xmath25 connections to the upper and lower ab arm .",

    "for now we use the scattering matrix @xmath34  we will discuss the implications of choosing this branch as compared to @xmath35 below .",

    "but the scattering matrix should also include phase factors which arise due to an ab flux and a finite length of the arms .",
    "for a symmetric geometry , i.e. , identical length of all arms , the scattering matrices assume the form @xmath49 where the first column / row corresponds to channels coming from / going to the left side and the second one is associated with the channel on the right hand side .",

    "different values of @xmath28 can be incorporated as a renormalization of the coupling constants @xmath45 and @xmath77 for the dot - lead and the direct lead - lead coupling , respectively .",
    "this leads to the scaling relation @xmath78      the main conclusion to be drawn from the results derived above is the observation of a close connection between the two models based on the tunnel - hamiltonian and the scattering - matrix formalism , respectively .",

    "it turned out , however , that they can describe the same physical realizations .",
    "to establish this fact , we concentrated on the regime in which both approaches are valid and easily applied .",
    "we considered noninteracting electrons and small ab interferometers , such that orbital phases can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , in the case of the single - dot ab interferometer we assumed small transparency through the direct arm .    in the scattering approach ,",
    "the total transmission depends on the strength of the coupling between the ab ring and the leads , i.e. , on the choice of the scattering matrix for the forks .",
    "we found that the total transmission is identical to the one obtained from the tunnel - hamiltonian approach in the case of symmetric forks , @xmath79 .",
    "of course , the ring - lead coupling strength can be different in different experimental setups .",

    "there is another observation which distinguishes the choice @xmath59 from other values .",
    "let us assume that the transmission amplitudes @xmath81 through the arms @xmath10 are small , @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in this case ,",
    "all trajectories with higher winding numbers around the ab ring are negligible , and simply the two paths through either arm 1 or 2 participate . from the scattering formalism",
    "we get the total transmission amplitude @xmath84 , which yields the intuitive formula for constructive interference @xmath85 for the special choice @xmath86 .",
    "this finishes the first part of this paper , which was to demonstrate the equivalence between the tunnel - hamiltonian and the scattering matrix approach . in the remaining part of this paper we study the effect of the orbital phase , which we have neglected so far .",
    "we study an ab interferometer with two qd s for noninteracting electrons by using the scattering - matrix approach .",
    "the finite length of arms of the interferometers can easily be accounted for in the scattering approach by introducing an orbital phase @xmath51 which enters the scattering matrices for the two arms , as specified in eq .",
    "( [ abphase ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we restrict here to the case of a symmetric sample , i.e. , all lengths from a fork to a qd are equal .",
    "we first show that also in the presence of the orbital phase @xmath51 models with different lead - ring coupling strength @xmath28 can be mapped onto each other by renormalizing the energy position @xmath87 and intrinsic width @xmath45 of the qd levels as well as the orbital phase .",
    "the explicit scaling relations will be derived .",
    "then , we analyze the transport characteristics and its dependence on the orbital phase @xmath51 for @xmath59 .      we start with the observation that a general fork matrix @xmath34 can be split into a special one ( here we choose the symmetric fork matrix , @xmath79 ) and two additional scatterers in the outgoing interferometer arms .",
    "this is possible , as such a combination of fork matrix and two identical scatterers in the outgoing arms ( with real entries only ) will combine to a total scattering matrix fulfilling the constraints of unitarity , time - reversal symmetry and real entries , thus be of the general form @xmath34 .",
    "the additional scatterers are then described by @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "these scattering matrices can be combined with the scattering of the ab arms .",

    "<S> we address the question of how to model electron transport through closed aharonov - bohm interferometers which contain quantum dots . by explicitly studying interferometers with one and two quantum dots , we establish the connection between a tunneling - hamiltonian formulation on the one hand and a scattering - matrix approach on the other hand . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that , under certain circumstances , both approaches are _ equivalent _ , i.e. , both types of models can describe the _ same _ experimental setups . </S>",
