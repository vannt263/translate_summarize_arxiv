    "<S> we outline the derivation of the hawking quanta - partner signal in correlations , and highlight the specific application to detect it in density - density correlations in becs .    </S>",
    "<S> black holes possess surprising quantum features . in the gravitational collapse of a star forming a black hole , hawking </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that the initial quantum vacuum state of matter fields gets distorted in such a way that our measurements , restricted to the exterior region , would detect a thermal state at the temperature @xmath0 , where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 for schwarzschild ) is the horizon s surface gravity . a too tiny effect , unfortunately , since for solar mass black holes @xmath3 is 7 orders of magnitude below the cosmic microwave background temperature .    the basic mechanism explaining the hawking effect is pair - production in the near - horizon region , with one member escaping to infinity ( the positive energy _ hawking quanta _ ) and the other falling into the black hole ( the negative energy _ partner _ ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can see this effect by looking at correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the initial vacuum state contains local correlations that are transferred , in the course of the time evolution , to nonlocal correlations between the black hole and the external region ( these are precisely the correlations hawking quanta - partner ) . such correlations , lost in the tracing operation implicit in any measurement performed in the external region , have a typical form that characterizes the hawking effect . in the gravitational case , however , their study is of purely academic interest due to the impossibility of measuring them .    </S>",
    "<S> a completely different framework to test the existence and the detectability of the hawking effect was proposed by unruh @xcite , who used the mathematical equivalence between light propagation in a curved spacetime and sound propagation in inhomogeneous eulerian fluids to predict the production of a thermal flux of phonons whenever an acoustic horizon ( i.e. a region separating subsonic and supersonic flow ) is formed . </S>",
    "<S> the reasoning is the same as hawking s , and rests on the fact that the nature of the effect is kinematical , i.e. it does not depend on the underlying dynamics but just on the details of wave propagation in a black - hole like geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> unruh s motivation was to test the robustness of the hawking effect against modifications of the relativistic ( hydrodynamic in this case ) theory at short distances , an analysis much more difficult to perform in the gravitational case ( the so called transplanckian problem @xcite ) .    among the many systems proposed </S>",
    "<S> ( see for instance @xcite ) , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) offer particularly attractive experimental conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the huge difference between the hawking temperature and that of the surrounding can be here reduced to just one order of magnitude . still , it appears difficult to separate the thermal flux of the created hawking - unruh phonons from that of the ( bigger ) background .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation appears more promising if we look at the signature of this effect in the correlations , exploiting the crucial ( and obvious ) fact that in this context the acoustic origin of the horizon does not forbid correlation measurements between the exterior and the black hole .    </S>",
