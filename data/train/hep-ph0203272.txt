    "when primary cosmic - ray protons and nuclei enter the atmosphere their interactions produce secondary , `` atmospheric '' cosmic rays including all the hadrons and their decay products . the spectrum of these secondaries peaks in the gev range , but extends to high energy with approximately a power - law spectrum . because they are weakly interacting , neutrinos were the last component of the secondary cosmic radiation to be studied , and the time - scale for progress has been correspondingly slow .",
    "the basic principles of detection and very rough estimates of rates were known by 1960 .",
    "markov @xcite suggested the idea of detecting neutrino - induced horizontal or upward - moving muons in a detector in a deep body of water and estimated the rates that might be observed  @xcite .",
    "greisen  @xcite estimated roughly the rate of neutrino interactions inside a large , deep cherenkov detector .",
    "two groups  @xcite independently reported observations of atmospheric neutrinos in 1965 by detecting horizontal muons in detectors so deep that the muons could not have been produced in the atmosphere .    with the advent of very large , deep underground detectors , whose construction was originally motivated by the search for proton decay , there are now extensive measurements of the flux of atmospheric neutrinos in which the events occur within the fiducial volume of the detector .",
    "what is emerging from recent studies is a discovery which is likely to have an impact comparable to that of the discoveries made with atmospheric cosmic rays half a century ago , including existence of the pion , the kaon and the muon .",
    "the 50 kiloton superkamiokande experiment , with a 20 kiloton fiducial volume , has now accumulated sufficient statistics to see clearly that the flux of muon - neutrinos depends not only on the rate at which they are produced in the atmosphere , but also on the pathlength they travel to the detector  @xcite .",
    "the detector has a cylindrical shape , and its response is up - down symmetric to within a few percent .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino beam is also symmetric under reflection about a horizontal plane through the detector  except for geomagnetic effects that we discuss in detail below .",
    "there is nevertheless a deficit of upward muon - neutrinos , with pathlengths of order @xmath0  km , relative to downward neutrinos , which are produced within tens of kilometers of the detector .",
    "the most likely cause of this pathlength - dependence is neutrino oscillations , in which neutrinos produced as muon - type , after passing a certain distance ( which depends on energy ) , manifest themselves with a different  flavor \" , in this case as @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the implication of this behaviour is that the neutrinos possess a small but non - zero mass , thus pointing to physics beyond the standard model of particle physics .",
    "this discovery has stimulated intense activity to find the implications for particle theory , and to relate this manifestation of neutrino physics to the solar neutrino problem , which is now also understood to be another manifestation of neutrino properties  @xcite .    the first evidence that atmospheric neutrinos were not behaving as expected came from the observation by imb that the fraction of neutrino interactions with stopping muons was lower than expected  @xcite .",
    "then kamioka reported that the ratio of muon - like to electron - like neutrino interactions was lower than expected  @xcite .",
    "the frejus experiment , however , reported a ratio consistent with expectation  @xcite .",
    "these detectors had fiducial volumes ranging from a fraction to a few kilotons .",
    "as statistics accumulated from the water detectors ( imb and kamioka )  @xcite and results were reported from soudan  @xcite , evidence for the _ atmospheric neutrino anomaly _ increased . in the last paper from the kamioka experiment  @xcite ,",
    "the first evidence for a pathlength dependence characteristic of neutrino oscillations emerged .    in the case of mixing between two flavors of neutrinos ,",
    "one of which is @xmath2 , the probability that a neutrino produced as a @xmath2 travels a distance l and is detected as a @xmath2 is @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the difference of the squared masses of the two related mass eigenstates and @xmath5 is the angle that characterizes mixing between the two states .",
    "thus the characteristic signature of neutrino oscillations is a deviation from the expected flux as @xmath6 varies .",
    "currently , the best fit to the data of super - k  @xcite has @xmath7  ev@xmath8 with full mixing , @xmath9 .",
    "[ fig1 ] summarizes the current situation with the measurements of super - k .",
    "one sees that the characteristic first oscillation dip can not be resolved at present with super - kamiokande .",
    "this is a consequence of its limited energy and angular resolution coupled with the fact that , with the estimated value of @xmath10 , the first minimum occurs for pathlengths @xmath11 this distance from production in the atmosphere to underground detector corresponds to neutrinos coming from near the horizon where the pathlength changes rapidly with zenith angle . this consideration  @xcite limits the accuracy with which @xmath10 can be determined with the atmospheric neutrino beam . on the other hand  @xcite the determination of the value of the mixing angle ,",
    "since it is large , can be very precise with atmospheric neutrinos , limited only by statistics .",
    "contained neutrino events in super - kamiokande are classified as sub - gev and multi - gev . to probe the atmospheric neutrino spectrum at higher energy it is necessary to make use the older technique of neutrino - induced muons , where the effective volume is the projected area of the detector times the muon range .",
    "since the muon range increases with energy , so does the effective volume . fig .",
    "[ response ] shows the distribution of neutrino energies for four classes of events .",
    "the @xmath12 oscillation interpretation that is emerging from the data is also consistent with deviations from the expected angular distributions of neutrino - induced upward muons measured in macro  @xcite and super - kamiokande  @xcite and with the ratios of stopping to throughgoing upward muons  @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidence for oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos is the subject to two recent reviews  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux . in doing so",
    ", we will emphasize those aspects that are important for making inferences about oscillations .",
    "these include the flavor ratios and angular distributions as well as pathlength distributions as a function of angle .",
    "we will also discuss the absolute normalization of the flux and the energy spectra up to very high energy . while inferences about oscillations emphasize measurements of ratios to minimize their dependence on the absolute accuracy of atmospheric neutrino flux calculations , the normalization is still important for checking the overall consistency of the measurements and calculations .",
    "in addition , high energy atmospheric neutrinos constitute the background for neutrino astronomy at all energies .",
    "both baikal  @xcite and amanda  @xcite have detected atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "neutrino telescopes with larger effective volume are planned  @xcite .",
    "more important is that the atmospheric neutrinos will be the primary calibration beam for the neutrino telescopes .",
    "we organize the review as follows . after giving an overview of the calculations in  2 , in the next three sections we review the primary spectrum , geomagnetic effects and hadronic interactions , which are the principal physical quantities that influence the neutrino spectrum .",
    "then in  6 we turn to a comparison of different calculations . until recently ,",
    "nearly all calculations were one - dimensional in the sense that all secondaries were assumed to follow the direction of the parent cosmic - ray from which they descended . in  7 we review the novel features of the recent three - dimensional calculations .",
    "atmospheric muons are closely related to atmospheric neutrinos , and they therefore provide an essential constraint .",
    "we review the muon data in relation to the neutrinos in  8 . in  9",
    "we enumerate the uncertainties in the various ingredients of the calculations and estimate the resulting uncertainty in the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino flux is a convolution of the primary spectrum at the top of the atmosphere with the yield ( @xmath13 ) of neutrinos per primary particle . to reach the atmosphere and",
    "interact , the primary cosmic rays first have to pass through the geomagnetic field .",
    "thus the flux of neutrinos of type @xmath14 can be represented as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the flux of primary protons ( nuclei of mass a ) outside the influence of the geomagnetic field and @xmath17 represents the filtering effect of the geomagnetic field .",
    "free and bound nucleons are treated separately because propagation through the geomagnetic field depends on magnetic rigidity ( total momentum divided by total charge ) whereas particle production depends to a good approximation on energy per nucleon .",
    "a proton of rigidity @xmath18  ( gv ) has total energy per nucleon @xmath19 whereas the corresponding relation for helium is @xmath20 .",
    "the neutrinos come primarily from the two - body decay modes of pions and kaons and the subsequent muon decays .",
    "the decay chain from pions is@xmath21 with a similar chain for charged kaons .",
    "when conditions are such that all particles decay , we therefore expect@xmath22 moreover , the kinematics of @xmath23 and @xmath24 decay is such that roughly equal energy is carried on average by each neutrino in the chain .",
    "the early calculations used the relation between muons and neutrinos implied by eq .",
    "[ chain ] .",
    "the idea is to parameterize the pion production spectrum in the atmosphere to fit an observed flux of muons . in this way",
    ", the primary spectrum and the particle production do not enter the calculation of the neutrino flux explicitly . since the kinematical relation between neutrinos and their parent pions is different for pions and kaons , some assumption about their relative importance has to be made .",
    "most of the essential features of the atmospheric neutrino spectrum were already displayed and discussed in the 1961 paper of zatsepin and kuzmin  @xcite .",
    "muons with energy of several gev and above reach the ground before decaying , so the @xmath25 ratio decreases with increasing energy .",
    "the resulting steepening of the @xmath26 spectrum occurs at lower energy near the vertical direction and at higher energy near the horizon because of the longer decay path for the parent muons with large zenith angle .",
    "the component of the @xmath2 flux from muon decay behaves the same way . for @xmath27  gev , the ratio of electron to muon neutrinos approaches a small value @xmath28% , with the main source of @xmath26 the decay @xmath29 . to the extent that there is uncertainty in kaon production",
    ", there will be a corresponding uncertainty in this ratio at high energy .",
    "these features of the neutrino flux are illustrated in fig .",

    "the right panel shows the key ratio of electron neutrinos to muon neutrinos from several calculations  @xcite averaged over all directions for the specific location of super - k .    in calculating neutrinos from decay of muons , it is important to include the effect of muon polarization .",
    "although they did not include it in their calculation , zatsepin and kuzmin pointed out that it would have the effect of incrasing the @xmath30 ratio by about 5% .",
    "muons are produced fully polarized in the two - body decays of pions and kaons , with the direction of polarization determined by the direction of the muon in the rest frame of its parent .",
    "because of the steep spectrum , the effect does not average to zero in the integral over the parent energies .",
    "moreover , it has the same sign for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "volkova  @xcite pointed out the importance of neutrino polarization in the context of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "the angular and energy dependence of muons and neutrinos from decay of pions and kaons is determined by the competition between decay and interaction of the parent mesons .",
    "the critical energy for pions in the atmosphere is @xmath31  gev , and @xmath32  gev for kaons . for @xmath33",
    "the neutrino spectrum has approximately the same power as the parent meson production spectrum and hence of the primary spectrum of nucleons . for @xmath34",
    "the neutrino spectrum is one power steeper and is proportional to @xmath35 . since @xmath36 , the spectrum of neutrinos from pion decay steepens before that of neutrinos from decay of kaons ,",
    "so that kaons become increasingly important at high energy . since the change of slope depends on zenith angle as well as energy ,",
    "it is possible in principle to use the observed ( @xmath37 ) dependence of the muon flux to estimate , or at least set an upper limit , on the fraction of kaons .",
    "@xcite used this method to show that atmospheric muons are not dominated by kaons .",
    "the importance of kaons relative to pions is further enhanced at high energies for neutrinos as compared to muons because most of the energy in pion decay goes to the muon as compared to the neutrino , whereas it is divided nearly equally in the @xmath38 decay . for @xmath39",
    "gev kaons become the dominant source of neutrinos even though the kaon / pion ratio at production is small .",
    "perkins  @xcite has reviewed calculations that reconstruct the neutrino flux from the muon flux .",
    "refinements account for variation of the geomagnetic field over the globe and start from muon data at high altitude where most of the pion and kaon decays occur .",

    "not only do these approximations allow a good qualitative understanding of the features of the atmospheric neutrino flux , but they are valuable for diagnostic purposes , for example , to determine what ranges of primary energy and what regions of phase space in particle production are important for various classes of events .",

    "the fact that the observed azimuthal variation can be understood entirely as a consequence of geomagnetic effects therefore confirms that the observed pathlength dependence ( i.e. dependence on zenith angle ) is not due to a poorly understood geomagnetic effect , but is a consequence of pathlength- dependence of the neutrinos .",
    "the ams detector on the space shuttle found and measured  @xcite at 380 km altitude a population of partially trapped particles below the local geomagnetic cutoff .",
    "this population is related to the cosmic - ray albedo previously known from stratospheric balloon flights above 30 kilometers ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it originates when higher energy cosmic rays above the local geomagnetic cutoff interact in the atmosphere and produce secondaries that curve away from the earth",

    "several authors  @xcite have analyzed this `` second spectrum '' recently by performing 3-dimensional calculations which reproduce the data and allow them to make conclusions about its origin and properties . since only a small fraction of the secondary nucleons move away from earth , the intensity of the sub - cutoff population is significantly lower than would be the case in the absence of a geomagnetic field .",
    "in addition , a fraction of the particles in the equatorial region remains trapped for several cycles , so that the rate at which these particles re - enter the atmosphere is lower ( by a factor equal to the inverse of the number of trapped cycles ) than what is measured at 380  km .",
    "the reduction of the re - entrant flux is greatest in the equatorial region where the cutoff is generally high . on average ,",
    "the re - entrant sub - cutoff flux above the threshold for significant pion production is always at least an order of magnitude below the flux at the cutoff energy  @xcite .",

    "in this section we review the use of muon flux as a constraint on the atmospheric neutrino calculations .",
    "we focus on the low energy region , where pions give the dominant contribution to neutrinos as well as to muons .",
    "[ fig - mu - growth]a shows the growth curve of the vertical atmospheric muon flux for @xmath203  gev as a function of atmospheric depth @xmath204 .",
    "the flux increases with depth from top of atmosphere down to @xmath205 . for @xmath206  gm / cm@xmath8 ( where @xmath208 is the nucleon interaction length )",
    "the increase is proportional to @xmath209 . in the region of 100200",

    "below 200  g / cm@xmath8 , the muon flux decreases rapidly as muon production decreases and muon decay and energy - loss become important .",
    "since decay probability and the importance of energy loss depend on energy , the growth curve depend somewhat on energy , but the qualitative behavior is unchanged .",
    "[ fig - mu - growth]b shows the median primary energy per nucleon for vertical muons ( dashed lines ) and neutrinos averaged over all angles ( heavy solid and dotted curves ) .",
    "comparison of response curves for muons at the ground and at float altitude ( typically @xmath210  g / cm@xmath8 ) shows the effect of muon energy loss in the atmosphere .",
    "muons typically lose @xmath211  gev propagating through the atmosphere , and most muons produced with this energy decay before reaching the ground . on the other hand , high in the atmosphere the muons have not lost energy and are closer in energy to the primaries . for neutrinos , the solid line is for kamioka site , and the dotted line is the result that would be obtained in the absence of a geomagnetic cutoff . the response curve for north america or gransasso would be between the solid and dashed lines .",
    "both muon charges ( @xmath212 ) , and all neutrinos species ( @xmath2 , @xmath93 , @xmath26 , @xmath94 ) were summed for these curves .",
    "measurements of muons in the cosmic radiation date back to the early days of the subject .",
    "a wealth of information on this and other relevant topics is to be found in the comprehensive work of grieder  @xcite .",
    "there is also a recent study of muons with @xmath213  gev at ground level in which the authors have corrected the data for different observing conditions  @xcite .",
    "a thorough summary is also given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the past decade , several groups have measured the flux of muons on the ground and during ascent to float altitude  @xcite , and several groups  @xcite have compared their calculations to some or all of this data .",
    "several issues arise in comparing calculations with muon data .",
    "one is whether to use the primary spectrum measured during the muon flight ( if available ) or to use some kind of best fit or preferred spectrum .",
    "for example , battistoni et al .",
    "@xcite get generally good agreement with the caprice muon data  @xcite using the primary spectrum of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is higher than that measured the caprice detector  @xcite at the same time as the muon measurement was made .",
    "they note that their normalization would have been generally lower than the muon data had they used the caprice primary spectrum . on the other hand the caprice primary spectrum is used in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain the results shown in fig .",
    "reffig - mu - growtha .",
    "that calculation uses the interaction model target  2.1 , which gives higher neutrino fluxes at soudan than the calculation with fluka  @xcite .",
    "since the muon fluxes are also measured with no geomagnetic cutoff , the origin of the difference between these two results is presumably the same  a difference in pion production in interactions of @xmath214  gev .",
    "[ fig - lynn - bess - caprice ]  @xcite compares calculations with data of two measurements both made in summer at lynn lake in northern canada where the geomagnetic cutoff is negligible .",
    "the caprice muon data  @xcite was obtained in 1994 , while the bess muon data is a compilation of observations made in 1997 , 1998 , and 1999  @xcite . the neutron monitor count rates for both experiments ( averaged over the three dates in the case of bess ) are similar to that of 1998 when bess and ams measured the primary cosmic ray spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ modulation ] ) .",
    "the left panel shows a comparison with the muon fluxes at the ground .",
    "the comparison at float altitude is shown on the right .",
    "it is noteworthy that the two measurements of the muon flux at the ground are in better agreement with each other than the corresponding two measurements of the primary proton spectrum  @xcite . despite relatively long exposures at float altitude , the statistics are poor because of the low flux .",
    "finally , we note that it may also be useful to compare high - statistics ground level measurements made a different geomagnetic locations .",
    "@xcite compares a measurement at lynn lake ( @xmath215  gv ) with one at ft .",
    "sumner ( @xmath216  gv ) . ref .",
    "@xcite compares their ground level measurement at lynn lake with a measurement at tsukuba , japan , which has a higher cutoff of @xmath217  gv .",
    "the charge ratios measured at the locations with a significant geomagnetic cutoff fall below those measured at lynn lake for @xmath218  gev .",
    "this is expected qualitatively for several reasons .",
    "helium is relatively more important at high cutoff because the energy per nucleon at cutoff is approximately half that of protons , and helium produces a charge ratio of unity .",
    "in addition , when the cutoff is high the low energy muons must come more from the central region of interactions above cutoff , and the charge ratio is lower in the central region .",
    "finally , there is also some contribution from the east - west effect since vertical muons of opposite sign are bent in opposite directions  @xcite .",
    "we summarize this section as follows . because of decay and energy loss , low energy muons at the ground carry less information about neutrino production than those at high altitude where most of the neutrinos are produced . in addition , the variation of atmospheric structure from barometric and seasonal changes is significant and must be accounted for . at float altitude ,",
    "the muons reflect rather directly the properties of pion production and primary cosmic - ray intensity since only one interaction is involved , but this is above the depth where most muons and neutrinos are produced and the flux is very low .",
    "on the other hand , the peak of the grown curve has so far been studied only during ascent where the balloon rises rapidly through the atmosphere , so that statistical and systematic uncertainties are larger than on the ground or at float .",
    "in addition , at all altitudes , the fraction of @xmath68gev muons passing through a detector is always much smaller than the number of muons that were produced above it  @xcite . thus calculating the muon flux is more delicate than calculating the neutrino flux which is an integral over all depths .",
    "remaining uncertainties in the flux of atmospheric neutrinos come mainly from the primary spectrum and from the treatment of hadronic interactions .",
    "in addition , there remain uncertainties of a technical nature related to remaining approximations in present calculations .",
    "the uncertainty in the signal for a given experiment depends on its response function , which determines the distribution of primary energy responsible for the signal .",
    "key examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ response1 ] .",
    "an estimate  @xcite of the uncertainty in the primary spectrum in the light of recent measurements by bess  @xcite and ams  @xcite is @xmath219% below @xmath220  gev / nucleon increasing to @xmath221% at @xmath222  tev / nucleon .",
    "this is based on a fit ( eq .  [ todor ] to bess and ams data alone and assumes a power - law to extrapolate beyond the upper range of those measurements ( @xmath223  gev ) .    a more proper estimate of the uncertainty in the primary spectrum uses all valid measurements , including those with larger quoted uncertainties , to estimate the systematic uncertainty in the primary spectrum .",
    "[ fig - primary ] shows a collection of measurements for protons and helium .",
    "although there are now several recently reported measurements below 100 gev , there is a striking lack of recent data in the tev range , important for @xmath95-induced upward muons . even assuming the high - energy data should be renormalized down to connect with the low - energy data , the measurements cover a range of @xmath133% below 100  gev and @xmath224% above .",
    "it is more difficult to quantify the uncertainties due to hadronic interactions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ raeven ] , large regions of phase space are not measured , and models are needed to interpolate and extrapolate into the unmeasured regions .",
    "study of fig .",
    "[ hondaplot ] show a scatter of 20 - 25% even if we consider the data of ref .",
    "@xcite as an outlier . on the other hand",
    ", this treats the different inclusive cross sections as independent of each other , when in fact they are interrelated by energy conservation .    combining the systematic uncertainties in primary spectrum and in pion production as",
    "if they were independent statistical uncertainties , we would therefore estimate an overall theoretical uncertainty of @xmath7120 to 25% in the energy range relevant for contained neutrino interactions and somewhat larger at higher energy .      calculations usually assume a spherical earth with the surface at sea level . when parent mesons enter the ground before decaying they loose energy rapidly by ionization or the nuclear interactions and produce only very low energy neutrinos .",
    "therefore , when there is a high mountain over the neutrino detector , the neutrino flux is reduced to some extent .",
    "the effect is negligible except near the vertical and then only for decay products of muons .",
    "the reduction has been estimated  @xcite as a 23  % effect for @xmath26 in the 10 - 100 gev range due to the ikenoyama mountain over super - kamiokande , which has a peak at approximately 1300  m above sea level .",
    "calculations are normally made for an average atmosphere . while pressure and seasonal variations have a noticeable effect on surviving muon fluxes at the ground , they are small for for neutrinos",
    ". variations at the per cent level have been estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a consistent picture emerges from comparison of a variety of data to calculations of the flux of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "all analyses emphasize comparison to ratios , which include @xmath30 and up / down for contained events and stopping / throughgoing and vertical / horizontal for neutrino - induced upward muon . as a consequence ,",
    "an offset in normalization does not affect the conclusions about oscillations , which are robust .    nevertheless , it is also interesting and informative to compare the measured neutrino flux as directly as possible in an absolute fashion with the calculations .",
    "[ subgev ] compares the neutrino fluxes measured at super - k with the two calculations  @xcite that have been used extensively as input to the detector simulation .",
    "the comparisons are made as a function of visible energy by the super - k group  @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes are consistent with what is expected for oscillations in this energy range that involve @xmath2 and @xmath1 but not @xmath26 ; namely , there is a deficit of @xmath2 , whereas the measured flux of electron neutrinos is consistent with the calculation .",
    "systematic comparisons of more recent calculations with data are not yet available . based on comparisons between old and new calculations such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ tar - tom ] , however , we expect that the new calculations will give significantly lower predicted neutrino fluxes . in refs .",

    "@xcite the primary spectrum is lower than before  @xcite . we expect the predictions may be reduced by as much as 15 to 20% , without changing the ratios significantly .",
    "possible resolutions include uncertainties in the neutrino cross sections  @xcite or systematic uncertainty in primary spectrum ( despite the agreement between bess  @xcite and ams  @xcite or higher pion production ( despite new calculations ) or some combination of the above .",
    "figure  [ global ] is a global view of the omnidirectional neutrino flux from the mev range up to 100 pev .",
    "below 15 - 18  mev solar neutrinos dominate , as indicated by the shaded region .",
    "it has been pointed out  @xcite that there is potentially a window between @xmath225 and @xmath226  mev where the accumulated diffuse flux from supernovae in the universe could be comparable to or larger than the flux of atmospheric neutrinos .    the heavy solid line shows the flux of atmospheric @xmath227 integrated over all directions .",
