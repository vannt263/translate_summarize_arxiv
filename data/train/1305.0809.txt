    "a less - often encountered feature of afterglows is the peak displayed by some optical light - curves at early times ( up to 1 h after trigger ) .",
    "a case by case modelling of those peaks could provide a test of the possible models for a light - curve peak , as was done , for instance , for the jet model using the optical light - curve breaks seen at later times .",

    "we continue to investigate the peak models mentioned above , by applying _ analytical _",
    "results for the @xmath2 relation expected for the synchrotron emission from the _ forward - shock _ to afterglows with _ x - ray peaks_. the fraction of swift x - ray afterglows displaying a peak is much smaller than for optical afterglows because the x - ray peak is most often missed , being overshined by the prompt grb emission . we have found about a dozen of x - ray light - curves with peaks among the several hundred x - ray afterglow light - curves in the xrt database ,",
    "most of which are accompanied by a spectral hardness evolution that indicates that the emerging x - ray light - curve peak has an origin (= afterglow ) different than the grb prompt emission .",
    "the importance of x - ray peaks lies in that , unlike for optical peaks , the slope of the x - ray afterglow spectrum was measured and can be used for model testing , as all light - curve peak models lead to an @xmath7 relation with an exponent that depends on the spectral slope .",
    "as we shall see , the @xmath2 peak relation is steeper for optical peaks than for x - ray peaks , which we will use to further test the two light - curve peak models .",
    "the sample of afterglows with optical light - curve peaks used in this work contains 19 afterglows presented in panaitescu & vestrand ( 2011 ) , which are the afterglows with peaks observed until 2009 and for which the peak @xmath8 ( full width at half maximum ) is less than a decade ( 1 dex ) in time .",
    "we add to that set 12 other peaks , some with @xmath8 larger than 1 dex ( they were previously considered plateaus or of uncertain type ) . for a few afterglows , the peak does not start at the first measurement but appears after a flat or a decreasing optical flux ; 110205 displays two clear peaks , both have included in the current sample .    for that set of 31 peaks , the @xmath9 optical fluxes ( @xmath10 ) were calculated assuming an optical spectral slope @xmath11 .",

    ", we will search for the parameter whose variation among afterglows can explain the existence of the bright / late edge of peak fluxes and epochs in the @xmath54 plane ( i.e. can induce the @xmath2 correlations of eqs [ optplaw ] and [ xplaw ] ) , and that can yield a steeper @xmath2 dependence for optical peaks than for x - ray peaks .",
    "a structured or dual outflow model was first proposed by berger et al ( 2003 ) to explain the radio emission of grb afterglow 030329 .",
    "the existence of many afterglows with decoupled optical and x - ray afterglow light - curves ( i.e. with different decay rates at these two frequencies or with chromatic x - ray breaks ) has revived interest in this model ( e.g. racusin et al 2008 ) .",
    "the basic feature of this model for light - curve peaks is that the observer is located outside the opening of the afterglow jet , @xmath60 , at an angle @xmath61 .",
    "that is a somewhat unappealing feature , as it implies that the grb emission is produced by a different jet , whose aperture includes the direction toward the observer , allowing us to localize the burst and follow its afterglow .",
    "a more palatable version of it is an outflow with an non - uniform angular structure ( i.e. distribution of ejecta energy with direction in the jet ) , such as a bright core moving toward the observer and emitting @xmath62-rays during the prompt phase and an envelope surrounding the core an dominating the afterglow emission at later times .    for simplicity of derivations",
    ", we focus below on the off - aperture jet , but the results for the peak flux and epoch should be the same for an envelope outflow .",
    "the emission received by the observer is that in the comoving frame , boosted relativistically , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the relativistic boost factor @xmath65 @xmath57 being the jet lorentz factor , and assuming @xmath66 and @xmath67 . at early times ( i.e. when @xmath68 ) , the doppler boost increases while at later time ( i.e. when @xmath69 ) , the doppler factor decreases , both owing to the jet deceleration",
    ". the behaviour of that factor is convolved with the decrease of the afterglow flux in the comoving frame , at frequencies above the peak of the comoving - frame ( synchrotron ) emission spectrum , also due to the continuous jet deceleration . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the increase of @xmath64 dominates and the observer sees an increasing afterglow flux , until @xmath70 , when the afterglow light - curve peaks , being followed by a decreasing flux when @xmath69 .",
    "thus the afterglow peak occurs when the ever - widening @xmath59-opening cone of relativistically - boosted emission contains the direction toward the observer , at which time the doppler boost is @xmath71    the observer offset angle @xmath72 is the only parameter to which makes sense to attribute the the @xmath73 correlation , as an increasing angle @xmath72 yields a later peak epoch @xmath5 and a lower peak flux @xmath4 ( see below ) . to calculate the @xmath73 relation induced by a variable angle @xmath72 , one has to relate @xmath4 and @xmath5 to the offset angle .",
    "the observer - frame arrival time @xmath18 of the photons emitted by a relativistic source moving at lorentz factor @xmath74 and angle @xmath72 relative to the direction toward the observer is found by integrating @xmath75    to calculate the afterglow flux at @xmath5 , we restrict our attention to the forward - shock synchrotron emission ( i.e. the emission from the shocked ambient medium ) , and leave the derivation of the @xmath73 relation for the reverse - shock emission to the fans of that model . in the comoving frame , the forward - shock synchrotron emission peaks at frequency @xmath76 with @xmath77 being the typical post - shock electron energy , @xmath78 the magnetic field energy density , @xmath79 the post - shock particle density , and @xmath80 the density of the circumburst medium .",
    "the comoving frame synchrotron flux density at @xmath81 is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the number of forward - shock electrons and @xmath84 the mass of the energized ambient medium .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum has a `` cooling '' break at the characteristic synchrotron frequency @xmath85 of the electrons whose radiative cooling timescale ( @xmath86 ) equals the dynamical timescale ( @xmath87 ) , thus @xmath88 and @xmath89    in the observer frame , the characteristics of the synchrotron spectrum are @xmath90 and the afterglow flux at an observing frequency @xmath91 is @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the slope of the afterglow spectrum at frequency observing @xmath91 . the case given in equation ( [ f3 ] ) applies only to optical light - curves because the implied spectrum ( @xmath96 ) could be compatible with that of optical afterglows but is clearly harder than observed for x - ray afterglows",
    "( eq [ bx ] ) .      for an adiabatic jet that does not spread laterally (",
    "because , for instance , the jet is embedded in a confining envelope ) , conservation of energy during the interaction between the jet and the ambient medium reads @xmath97 with @xmath98 the jet energy and @xmath99 .",
    "then , for a @xmath100 ( with @xmath101 ) radial distribution of the ambient medium density , the jet dynamics is given by @xmath102 and equation ( [ dt ] ) yields @xmath103 hence the epoch of the light - curve peak , @xmath104 , satisfies @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the jet radius at which the light - curve peaks , the last relation following from equation ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath107 eliminating @xmath72 between the expressions for @xmath108 and @xmath5 , it follows that @xmath109    substituting @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 in equations ( [ nui ] )  ( [ nuc ] ) and using equation ( [ rp ] ) , we get @xmath113 the dependence of the afterglow peak flux @xmath114 on the light - curve peak epoch @xmath5 can be now calculated from equations ( [ fo])([f3 ] ) , with @xmath115 , and using the spectral characteristics given in equation ( [ tp0 ] ) , with @xmath116 from equation ( [ rp ] ) .      with the above - mentioned substitutions , one obtains the following exponents for the @xmath117 correlation for afterglow light - curves from off - aperture jets interacting with a homogeneous medium ( @xmath118 ) : @xmath119 , which is too small compared with the values measured for optical and x - ray peaks , and @xmath120 for the former case , the average measured x - ray spectral slope ( eq [ bx ] ) implies that @xmath121 , which is too large than what is measured for x - ray peaks ( eq [ xplaw ] ) .",
    "the second case leads to @xmath122 , which is almost compatible with observations .",
    "however , this case can not account for the slope @xmath123 measured for x - ray peaks , _ if _ the optical and x - ray afterglow emissions arose from the same outflow ( same electron population ) : for @xmath124 ( i.e. @xmath125 ) , we expect @xmath126 , which is inconsistent with observations ; for @xmath127 , ( i.e. @xmath128 ) , equation ( [ oxs0 ] ) implies that @xmath129 , contrary to observations ( eq [ gox ] ) .",
    "similar to above , for a medium having the @xmath130 radial stratification expected for the winds of massive stars ( as the progenitors of long grbs ) , we obtain @xmath131 , which is smaller than measured for optical and x - ray peaks , and @xmath132 in the former case , the average x - ray spectral slope leads to @xmath133 , which is larger than observed , while the latter case leads to @xmath134 , which is consistent with observations of x - ray peaks , but too small for the optical peaks slope .",
    "however , if @xmath135 , then equation ( [ oxs2 ] ) yields @xmath136 , which is marginally consistent with the measured value ( eq [ gox ] ) .",
    "thus , a jet seen off aperture , interacting with a wind - like medium , can account for both the optical and x - ray peak slopes provided that the synchrotron cooling frequency is between optical and x - rays .      in deriving the above scalings for the flux",
    ", we have ignored any intrinsic afterglow parameter and kept only the dependencies on the observer s offset angle @xmath72 because we are interested in the @xmath73 relation induced by the variation of @xmath72 .",
    "the ignored afterglow parameters , kinetic energy per solid angle @xmath98 and ambient density @xmath80 , are not the same for all afterglows , and their variation of @xmath98 and @xmath80 among afterglows yields a scatter in the @xmath54 the plane , along the relation induced by the variation of @xmath72 .",
    "equation ( [ tptheta ] ) implies that , aside from that scatter induced by the variation of @xmath98 and @xmath80 , the offset angle @xmath72 must span a range of 1 dex , to account for the 3 dex spread in observed peak time @xmath5 ( fig [ oxpeaks ] ) . for typical afterglow energies and ambient medium densities , the jet lorentz factor at the earlier peak epochs shown in figure [ oxpeaks ] , of about 100 s ,",
    "is expected to be @xmath137 , which implies that the smallest offset is @xmath138 . to obtain a light - curve peak",
    ", the jet opening must be smaller than the observer s offset , thus the earliest peaks correspond to the narrowest jets , with @xmath139 .",
    "if all jets had the same opening , then the largest offset angle would be @xmath140 .",
    "however , the latest occurring peaks are not necessarily from narrow jets seen at a larger offset angle , they could also be from wider jets : at 10 ks , the jet lorentz factor is @xmath141 , hence the offset angle is @xmath142 and the widest jet could have @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , the range of peak epochs shown in figure [ oxpeaks ] suggests that afterglow jets have half - openings @xmath60 from 1/2 to 5 degrees and are seen at an angle @xmath144 , with @xmath145",
    ".      if the afterglow jet spreads laterally unimpeded , then the jet dynamics changes when the lateral spreading ( at the sound speed ) increases significantly the jet opening , leading to other dependencies of the peak flux @xmath4 on the peak epoch @xmath5 than derived above for a conical jet . defining @xmath146 to be the radius",
    "at which the jet lorentz factor has decreased to @xmath147 , where @xmath60 is the initial jet half - angle , the jet dynamics is given by ( panaitescu & vestrand 2011 ) @xmath148 for a homogeneous medium ( the jet dynamical equations can not be solved analytically for a wind - like medium ) . at @xmath149 ,",
    "the lateral spreading is negligible and the jet dynamics is the same as for a conical jet but at @xmath150 the lateral expansion of the jet more than doubled its initial aperture and an exponential deceleration sets in ( rhoads 1999 ) .    with the exception of observer locations just outside the jet opening , the afterglow light - curve peak occurs after @xmath146 ( i.e. @xmath151 ) , when the jet lateral spreading is significant .",

    "that condition and the dynamics of the jet at @xmath150 ( eq [ jetdyn ] ) , imply that @xmath157 this result can be simplified if it is assumed that all jets have the same @xmath60 and @xmath146 , which is equivalent to assuming that all jets have the same @xmath60 and ratio @xmath158 .",
    "this simplification is motivated by that we are searching for the @xmath2 dependence arising only from varying the observer location , and not from varying the jet dynamical parameters ( which is the subject of the next section , but in an other model for light - curve peaks ) .",
    "thus , @xmath159 the last scaling resulting from equation ( [ tp ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that , for a homogeneous medium , @xmath160 at @xmath150 . substituting it and the jet dynamics ( eq [ jetdyn ] ) in equations ( [ nui ] )  ( [ nuc ] )",
    ", we get @xmath161 @xmath162 @xmath163 from here , one can calculate @xmath164 by using equations ( [ f1 ] )  ( [ f3 ] ) , with @xmath165 and by substituting @xmath166 with the aid of equation ( [ rp ] ) : @xmath167 @xmath168 @xmath169 ignoring the @xmath108 factors ( because @xmath108 has a weak , sub - logarithmic dependence on @xmath5 , according to eq [ rp ] ) , one obtains : @xmath119 , which is inconsistent with the @xmath73 correlation measured for optical and x - ray peaks , and @xmath170 in the former case , the average x - ray spectral slope leads to an exponent @xmath171 , inconsistent with that measured for x - ray peaks , while the latter case yields @xmath172 , which is too large for x - ray peaks but consistent with that of optical peaks , thus this case can explain the the @xmath2 relation for optical peaks if optical were above the cooling frequency .",
    "if the cooling break were always between optical and x - rays , then the spreading - jet model expectation is @xmath173 , inconsistent with observations .",
    "in this model , for afterglow peak occurs when the reverse shock has finished crossing the ejecta shell and the motion of the shocked fluids starts to decelerate ( or to decelerate faster than before ) .",
    "we focus only on the forward - shock emission , which depends on fewer afterglow parameters than the reverse - shock s .",
    "depending on the initial geometrical thickness @xmath174 of the ejecta shell , the observer - frame deceleration timescale ( i.e. the afterglow peak epoch ) is either @xmath175 ( thick ejecta shell / relativistic reverse - shock case ) or is determined by the parameter set @xmath176 ( thin ejecta shell / semi - relativistic reverse - shock ) , where @xmath98 is the ejecta initial kinetic energy per solid angle and @xmath177 the ejecta initial lorentz factor .      if the ejecta is shell is sufficiently thin ( or , equivalently , sufficiently dense ) , the reverse - shock is semi - relativistic , the shocked fluids ( ejecta and ambient medium ) move at a lorentz factor @xmath57 lower than but close to that of the unshocked ejecta @xmath177 , and the time it takes the reverse shock to cross the ejecta shell is close to the time it takes the forward - shock to sweep - up a mass of ambient medium equal to a fraction @xmath178 of the ejecta mass .",
    "thus , the deceleration radius is defined by @xmath179 , from where @xmath180 for an external medium of proton density @xmath181 and the observer - frame deceleration timescale is @xmath182 the condition for a semi - relativistic shock is simply @xmath183 , which can be better expressed as an upper limit on @xmath177 .    the flux at @xmath184 can be calculated starting from equations ( [ nui ] )  ( [ fo ] ) , with two modifications .",

    "we found good evidence that @xmath31 for only one afterglow and @xmath19 for five other , while for the rest @xmath230 does not provide a statistically significant better fit . because we fit the afterglow light - curves with power - laws , finding that the afterglow beginning is different than the grb trigger happens mostly when the afterglow rise ( with time measured from burst beginning ) is curved in log - log space .",
    "consequently , such determinations of @xmath17 rely on the untested assumption that the intrinsic afterglow rise is a power - law",
    ". does not change significantly the slopes of the optical and x - ray peak flux ",
    "peak epoch relations ]    the @xmath231-corrected optical light - curves manifest a strong correlation between the peak flux @xmath4 and the peak epoch @xmath5 .",
    "the best fit to the afterglow peaks in the log - log plane is @xmath232 .",
    "if the peak epochs are shifted by ( @xmath32 ) the middle of the 90 percent confidence level on @xmath17 , the peak flux - peak epoch best - fit becomes @xmath233 .",
    "the probability for the @xmath73 correlation to occur by chance decreases by a factor 3 when an afterglow time - shift ( relative to the grb trigger ) is allowed .",
    "we have also identified 14 x - ray afterglows ( fig [ xpeaks ] ) that display a light - curve peak .",
    "although xrt has monitored several hundreds of x - ray afterglows so far , the x - ray peaks are very rarely seen because they are , most often , overshined by the prompt grb emission .",
    "the @xmath231-corrected x - ray peaks also display a peak flux ",
    "peak epoch correlation : @xmath1 , which is slower than for optical peaks , and whose index changes little if a shift of the afterglow beginning is allowed .",
    "there is a 50 percent chance that the distributions of optical and x - ray peak epochs ( fig [ oxpeaks ] ) are the same .",
    "the correlations identified for optical and x - ray peaks represent the bright and late edge of the entire distribution of peaks in the @xmath2 plane , as peaks that are dimmer or occur earlier are more likely to be missed .",
    "perhaps , the only model - independent conclusion that can be drawn from the existence of a bright and late edge in the distribution of peaks is the existence of an upper limit to the energy that afterglows radiate .",
    "two thirds of optical and x - ray peaks decay faster than @xmath234 after the peak , thus @xmath235 is a good measure of the radiative output for most afterglows .",
    "then , the peak correlation having a slope larger than unity ( 1.6 in x - rays , 2.0 in the optical ) implies that later peaks radiate less energy than earlier ones .    to reach more detailed conclusions , we have investigated two likely models for light - curve peaks , both pertaining to the synchrotron emission from the forward - shock the energizes the burst ambient medium .",
    "the slope of the bright - edge of the @xmath73 distribution enables a test of each model if it is assumed that that anticorrelation is induced by the variation of one parameter among the set of afterglows with peaks .",
    "one model is that of an off jet - aperture observer location , the afterglow peak occurring when the jet has decelerated enough that its emission is relativistically beamed toward the observer . in this model ,",
    "jets seen at a larger angle peak later and dimmer .",
    "we have derived the @xmath2 correlation induced by a variation of the observer offset angle , for both conical and laterally - spreading jets , and for a homogeneous or a wind - like medium , and we have found that a conical jet ( and either type of medium ) may explain the observed x - ray peak correlation , given the measured average x - ray spectral slope @xmath236 . if the optical peaks correlation is , indeed , steeper than for the x - ray peaks , that would require a wind - like ambient medium .",
    "the other model for afterglow peaks considered here is the onset of the forward - shock deceleration , occurring when the reverse shock has crossed the ejecta shell , the afterglow peak being due to a change in the dynamics of the forward - shock , caused by a decrease in the rate at which energy is transferred from the ejecta to the forward - shock .",
    "we have derived the @xmath2 correlation expected for a semi - relativistic reverse - shock ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 depend on the ejecta initial lorentz factor and the ambient medium density ) and for a relativistic reverse - shock ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 depend only on the geometrical thickness of the ejecta shell ) and have found that this model can explain the @xmath2 relation measured for x - ray peaks if the ambient medium is homogeneous and if x - ray is below the synchrotron cooling frequency ( for either type of reverse - shock ) , but it underpredicts the slope of the optical peak flux  peak epoch relation .",
    "there are three important caveats for any conclusion drawn from the slope of the optical and x - ray afterglow peaks .",
    "the first caveat is that the sample of x - ray peaks is small , hence the slope @xmath237 of the @xmath2 relation is still quite uncertain .",
    "the x - ray afterglow 060614 displays a plateau around the epoch of the optical peak and , thus , was not included in the sample of x - ray peaks . however , if an x - ray peak is assigned at the epoch of the optical peak , then the best - fit to the peak fluxes and epochs of the resulting set of 15 x - ray afterglows would have a slope @xmath238 , compatible with that measured in the optical ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "the second caveat is that requiring a model to account for the slopes of both optical and x - ray peaks is justified only if the afterglow emissions at these two frequencies arise from the same population of electrons .",
    "a simple test for the common origin of the optical and x - ray afterglow emission is the simultaneity of the light - curve peaks .",
    "most of optical peaks occurred while the x - ray afterglow was dominated by the prompt emission , hence the achromaticity of optical peaks is , in general , impossible to establish .",
    "the second optical peak of 100901 appears also in the x - ray , the optical and x - ray peaks of 100418 seem achromatic , but those of 110213 are chromatic .",
    "there are four optical peaks ( 060206 , 060614 , 070802 , 081029 ) for which the x - ray data suggest the existence of a simultaneous peak , although they do not show it clearly , and one ( 110205 ) achromatic optical peak . for two x - ray peaks ( 080310 , 080319c ) ,",
    "the optical data allow for a simultaneous optical peak occurring at the end of a light - curve plateau .",
    "all in all , there is evidence that optical and x - ray light - curve peaks occur simultaneously more often than not , i.e. in favour of a common origin of the optical and x - ray afterglow emissions .",
    "the third caveat is that we have tested only the ability of one model parameter to induce the observed @xmath2 anticorrelation but , in each model , there are other parameters that could alter the slope of that correlation . for the off - aperture observer model , where the fundamental parameter that drives the peak correlation is the observer s offset angle , the jet energy per solid angle and the ambient medium density may be seen as secondary parameters whose variation among afterglows only introduces some scatter around the peak correlation induced by the main parameter .",
    "however , for the deceleration - onset model , there are two basic parameters that can induce an @xmath2 anticorrelation ( the ambient density and the ejecta initial lorentz factor , or the ejecta shell thickness ) , the resulting slope of the @xmath2 relation depending on the ( unknown ) width of the distribution of those two parameters .",
    "moreover , given that both models for afterglow peaks considered here yield @xmath226 relation slopes that are either smaller or larger than measured for x - ray and optical peaks , it is possible that a peak relation of intermediate slope results from combining both peak mechanisms , some peaks being due to an off - jet observer location while others are caused by the onset of deceleration",
    ". that would make it even harder to use the @xmath2 relations identified here for model testing .",
