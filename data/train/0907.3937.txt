    "data for di - hadron correlations in auau and dau using the star detector show a suppression of high-@xmath2 hadron yields and modifications in the azimuthal correlation in central auau collisions @xcite . on the away - side of the trigger particles ,",
    "the observed broadening in the correlations reflects the presence of strong jet - medium interactions , possibly a mach cone effect @xcite .",
    "non - photonic electron triggered particle correlations probe heavy quark jet - medium interactions .",
    "electron - hadron ( e - h ) correlations on the near side , triggered by non - photonic electrons from charm and bottom decays , have different patterns due to the large mass difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons . using e - h correlations from pp collisions in comparison with pythia calculations , we can estimate the relative @xmath3 and @xmath4 contributions to the non - photonic electrons .",
    "the data sets used were collected by star at rhic in 2007 for auau , 2006 for cucu and 2005 ( @xmath5 gev / c ) and 2006 ( @xmath6 gev / c ) for pp .",
    "the time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite , the heart of star , was used to reconstruct the tracks of charged particles .",
    "additionally the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) and shower maximum detector ( smd ) @xcite , the electromagnetic calorimeters which surround the tpc in full @xmath7 azimuth , were required to have a least one track projected from the tpc onto it and also have an energy deposition greater than a predetermined minimum ( i.e. high - tower threshold ) .",
    "this is to increase the number and purity of high @xmath8 electrons . for cucu",
    "the threshold was at 3.75 gev , 5.5 gev for auau and 5.4 gev for pp .",
    "for pp and auau the pseudorapidity used was @xmath9 , while for cucu it was @xmath10 due to the partial installation of the bemc / smd .",
    "for the aa collisions we used a 0 - 20% centrality cut , the definition of which is explained in @xcite .    to identify electron candidates",
    "one used a combination of measurements : ionization energy loss ( de / dx ) in the tpc , ratio of particle momentum to energy deposited in the bemc and lastly the electromagnetic shower size in the smd  see @xcite for more detail .",
    "the primary background are photonic electrons either coming from photon conversions inside star or the dalitz decays of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in both cases",
    "the electron pairs have a small invariant mass .",
    "this background is removed by pairing electron candidates with a track having passed a loose de / dx cut around the electron ionization band . the distribution of 2d invariant masses ( @xmath13 is ignored to minimize tracking resolution effects @xcite ) for opposite sign ( _ oppsign _ ) pairs is obtained upon which a cut of @xmath14 gev/@xmath15 is applied to reject most photonic pairs . the combinatorial background is estimated using the 2d invariant mass distribution of same sign ( _ samesign _ ) pairs .",
    "the azimuthal correlation of non - photonic electrons and hadrons begins with a semi - inclusive ( _ semi - inc . _ ) electron sample , which is the inclusive electron sample minus the _ oppsign _ background ( after having applied the mass cut ) .",
    "the correlation is done via the following method : @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 is the same sign combinatorial background , while @xmath19 are the photonic electrons which were nt reconstructed due to inefficiencies @xmath20 , which is the photonic electron reconstruction efficiency estimated via simulations and found to be @xmath21 for auau , @xmath22 for cucu and @xmath23 for pp .",
    "there is only a minor transverse momentum dependence of the efficiency in the momentum range being looking at .",
    "more details on this method using a semi - inclusive electron sample are in @xcite .",
    "figures [ gold ] and [ copper ] plot the e - h azimuthal correlation for auau and cucu at 200 gev .",
    "the left panels show the raw correlations along with dashed curves for elliptic flow ( @xmath24 ) @xcite and zero yield at minimum ( zyam ) @xcite .",
    "systematic uncertainty of @xmath24 is determined by using a lower limit of zero and upper limit of 80% for auau or 60% for cucu of charged hadron @xmath24 .",
    "the momentum ranges used are 3 gev / c @xmath25 gev / c for trigger electrons and 0.15 gev / c @xmath26 gev / c for hadrons in aa collisions . to decrease the error bars ,",
    "the correlation is folded into [ 0 , @xmath27 and the data points beyond are reflections .",
    "one clearly already sees a modification of the away - side . the right panels plot",
    "the correlation after the @xmath24 subtraction and zyam application . on the away - side",
    "( around @xmath28 ) instead of a single peak there is a broadening ( auau ) or possible double - peak ( cucu ) structure . using a pythia calculation for pp to fit this one sees the @xmath29/ndf is rather poor .",
    "this modification of the away - side is similar to the di - hadron case in auau @xcite and probably indicates heavy quark interaction with the dense medium .",
    "background subtraction and panel ( b ) after the subtraction , with a dashed fitting curve from pythia pp expectations on the away side .",
    "the error bars are statistical , and the error band around zero shows the systematical uncertainty from zyam.[gold ] ]     background subtraction and panel ( b ) after the subtraction , with a dashed fitting curve from pythia pp expectations on the away side .",
    "the error bars are statistical , and the error band around zero shows the systematical uncertainty from zyam.[copper ] ]      fitting the near - side of the e - h correlation over various trigger @xmath8 ranges with a pythia simulation ( fitting method is described in @xcite ) one sees equal charm and bottom contribution above 5 gev / c , figure [ shingo ] ( a ) . combining this with the previously measured @xmath1 for non - photonic electrons ( @xcite , figure [ shingo ] ( c ) )",
    "one has      figure [ shingo ] ( b ) shows the most probable values for @xmath35 and @xmath36 with the dashed line being the 90% confidence limit ( taking @xmath1 and @xmath37 uncertainties into consideration ) . even if d decay electrons",
    "are fully suppressed @xmath38 .",
    "this indicates b meson yields are suppressed at high @xmath8 in heavy ion collisions presumably due to @xmath39 quark energy loss in the dense matter @xcite , modification of the fragmentation process due to the dense medium and/or dissociation / absorption of heavy flavor hadrons in the dense medium during the evolution @xcite . from it",
    "one can see that electrons coming from b decays are as suppressed as those from d decays .",
