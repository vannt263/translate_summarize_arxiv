    "the study of the quantum phase transitions(qpts ) has been the object of many theoretical and experimental investigations@xcite , since they play an essential role in understanding the low temperature properties of the materials@xcite . in particular , for low dimension magnetic materials , the study of quantum spin chains has provided much insight in this direction@xcite . motivated by this , in the last years , others tools have been used to investigate qpts in spin chains , such as , quantum discord@xcite , geometric phases@xcite and quantum fidelity@xcite , where the last two concepts were unified in the approach of the geometric tensors@xcite .",
    "all these tools have only one purpose , that is , to point out the existence of the quantum critical behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "the qpts are also directly related to quantum entanglement , which has been object of study in quantum computation@xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of spin systems is of great importance for understanding the behavior of the materials in low temperature regime .    among the quantum spin models , the one - dimensional xy model introduced by lieb _",
    "et al_.@xcite , with its generalized classes , have attracted much interest in the last decades . in particular , the models with multiple spin ( see refs.@xcite , and references therein ) and long - range interactions(see refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) have been object of intensive investigations .",
    "as pointed out by derzhko@xcite and in the references therein , quantum spin systems with multiple spin interactions work as effective spin models for the standard hubbard model under certain conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "models with long - range interactions are important to understand the process of quantum information in spin chains as well as for the study of the classical and/or quantum crossover , as it was explained by de lima and gonalves.@xcite .",
    "another importance of the long - range interaction is that it can induce first - order qpts , which play an important role in the quantum critical behaviour@xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will study the effect of the long - range interaction on the quantum critical behaviour of the extended one - dimensional xy - model with multiple spin interactions@xcite .",
    "the solution of the model can be obtained exactly , at arbitrary temperatures in a one - dimensional and the main purpose of the paper is to study the quantum critical behaviour of the model .",
    "we analyze these two kind of interactions , where we will show the role of each one , that is , we will show that the long - range interactions induce first and second order qpts and that their presence change the universality class of the model , as we will also verify the scaling relations proposed by continentino and ferreira@xcite for first - order qpts .",
    "while for the multisite interaction among spins , we will show the presence of many different kinds of quantum spin liquid phases , which after some time returned to be a relevant topic in the present research@xcite .    in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and obtain its exact solution by means of  jordan - wigner fermionization and the integral  gaussian transformation , and present its basic results , such as , the spectrum of the energy , magnetization at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "the quantum phase diagrams , as function of the interaction parameters , are presented and discussed in sec .",
