    "strontium titanate ( srtio@xmath0 ) is one of the most studied oxides of the abo@xmath0 perovskite type structures , due to its great technological importance .",
    "many interesting phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance , high-@xmath1 superconductivity , multiferroicity , and ferroelectricity are observed in complex oxides . since most of the interesting complex oxides have perovskite structure , srtio@xmath0 is an ideal starting point for their study .",
    "it has been widely used for integration with other oxides into heterostructures .",
    "those heterostructres show interesting properties such as thermoelectricity@xcite and superconductivity@xcite .",
    "many new concepts of modern condensed matter and the physics of phase transitions have been developed while investigating this unique material@xcite .",
    "srtio@xmath0 has applications in the fields of ferroelectricity , optoelectronics and macroelectronics .",
    "it is used as a substrate for the epitaxial growth of high temperature superconductors .",
    "srtio@xmath0 exhibits a very large dielectric constant . in comparison with sio@xmath2 ,",
    "srtio@xmath0 has almost two orders of magnitude higher dielectric constant and may as well offer a better replacement for sio@xmath2 in si - based nanoelectronic devices ( see @xcite[and references therein ] ) .",
    "srtio@xmath0 has found usage in optical switches , grain - boundary barrier layer capacitors , catalytic activators , waveguides , laser frequency doubling , high capacity computer memory cells , oxygen gas sensors , semiconductivity , etc @xcite .    during the last few decades ,",
    "the electronic , structural , elastic , and optical properties of srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) , as a model of abo@xmath0 perovskite , have been under intensive investigation both experimentally@xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "but , from a theoretical point of view , a proper description of its electronic properties is still an area of active research .",
    "theoretical computations have had difficulty in predicting the correct band gap energy and other related electronic properties of srtio@xmath0 from first principle . the density functional theory plus additional couloumb interactions ( dft+u )",
    "formalism @xcite has had good successes in obtaining correct energy bands and gaps of materials , but can only be applied to correlated and localized electrons , e.g. , 3@xmath3 or 4@xmath4 in transition and rare - earth oxides .",
    "the hybrid functionals ( for e.g. , heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) hybrid functional @xcite ) has also been used in attempt to improve on the energy bands and band gaps of materials .",
    "this approach involves a range separation of the exchange energy into some fraction of nonlocal hartree - fock exchange potential and a fraction of local spin density approximation ( lsda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) exchange potential .",
    "we should note that this range separation is not universal .",
    "there is always a range separation parameter @xmath5 which varies between 0 and @xmath6 .",
    "while it is reasonably clear that there exists a value of @xmath5 that gives the correct gap for a given system , this @xmath5 is not universal as it is always adjusted from one system to another @xcite .",
    "for example , in hse06 @xcite , @xmath5 @xmath7 0.11@xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the bohr radius ) and in perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbeh ) global hybrid @xcite , it is 25 @xmath10 short - range exact exchange and 75 @xmath10 short - range pbe exchange . even though the hse functional , in most cases , accurately reproduces the optical gap in semiconductors",
    ", it severely underestimates the gap in insulators @xcite and its band width in metallic systems is generally too large @xcite . the @xcite ( ev ) gga and the  @xcite  @xcite modified becke - johnson ( tb - mbj ) have also provided some improvements to the band gap of materials . for tb - mbj , while the band gaps are considerably improved , the effective masses are severely underestimated @xcite . in the case of the ev potential ,",
    "the equilibrium lattice constants are far too large as compared to experiment and , as such , leads to an unsatisfactory total energy @xcite .",
    "the theoretical underestimations of band gaps and other energy eigenvalues have been ascribed to the inadequacies of density functional potentials for the description of ground state electronic properties of semiconductors @xcite . also , other methods @xcite that entirely go beyond the density functional theory ( dft ) do not obtain the correct band gap values of most semiconductors without adjustment or fitting parameters @xcite .",
    "this unsatisfactory situation is a key motivation for our work .",
    "stoichiometric sto has an experimental , indirect band gap of 3.20 - 3.25 ev at room temperature @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations using several techniques have led to band gaps of srtio@xmath0 in the ranges 1.71 to 2.2 ev for lda and gga @xcite , 1.87 to 3.63 ev for hybrid dft @xcite , and value as high as 11.97 ev for the hatree - fock ( hf ) method @xcite .    in this paper , we present a simple , yet robust , and ab - initio method , based on self consistent solutions of the pertinent _ system _ of equations @xcite , that correctly predicts band gap values and related electronic properties of srtio@xmath0 rigorously , from first principle , within the lcao - gga formalism .",
    "we also compute the structural , elastic and optical properties of srtio@xmath0 .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction in section  [ sec : intro ] , the computational methods and details are given in section  [ sec : formalism ] .",
    "the results of our self - consistent calculations are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we then summarize and conclude in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in the ground state , sto has the simple cubic ( o@xmath11 - pm@xmath12 m ) perovskite structure@xcite , with sr atom sitting at the origin , ti at the body center and three oxygen atoms at the three face centers @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig : sro_isosurface ] ) .",
    "we used the room temperature experimental lattice constant of 3.91  @xcite .     at the experimental lattice constant of 3.91  as obtained with the optimal basis set using pw - gga .",
    "the horizontal , dashed line indicates the position of the fermi energy ( e@xmath13 ) ( -0.10872 ev ) which has been set equal to zero.,width=278 ]    our ab initio , self consistent , nonrelativistic calculations employed a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) formalism and a generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) potential .",
    "one may argue that relativistic effects are important for the description of srtio@xmath0 . as was noted by  @xcite  @xcite , relativistic effects are only important for the description of the high-@xmath14 dielectric band structure . their calculated , relativistic and non - relativistic band structure for srtio@xmath0 , up to an energy of 5 ev for the valence and conduction bands , respectively ,",
    "are almost identical .",
    "consequently , we expect a negligible relativistic correction for the band gap of srtio@xmath0 .",
    "the distinctive feature of our calculations , the use of the bagayoko , zhao , and williams ( bzw ) method , has been extensively described in the literature @xcite . this method has been shown to lead to accurate ground state properties of many semiconductors : c - inn @xcite , w - inn @xcite , w - cds @xcite , c - cds @xcite , rutile - tio@xmath2 @xcite , alas @xcite ,",
    "gan , si , c , ruo@xmath2 @xcite , and carbon nanotubes @xcite .    instead of",
    "assuming that a single trial basis set will yield the correct ground state charge density of the solid , the bzw method entails a minimum of three self - consistent calculations with basis sets of different sizes and generally with different polarization functions , i.e. , p , d , and f functions .",
    "the correct ground state is the one where all the occupied energies are at their minima . in practice",
    ", up to seven self - consistent calculations have been performed for some materials e.g , wurtzite zno @xcite .",
    "the computations begin with a relatively small basis set that should not be smaller than the minimal basis set .",
    "the latter is defined as one that is just large enough to account for all the electrons in the atomic or ionic species present in the solid .",
    "the preliminary , self - consistent calculations of the electronic properties of the species provide the wave functions that serve as input in the solid state calculations .",
    "the first , self consistent calculation for the solid is performed with this small basis set",
    "( calculation i ) that is subsequently augmented with one orbital for the next self - consistent calculation ( calculation ii ) .",
    "depending on the angular symmetry of the added orbital , the size of the new basis set is larger than that of the previous one by 2 , 6 , 10 , or 14 for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and f functions , respectively .",
    "the occupied energies from calculations i and ii are compared graphically and numerically .",
    "for the first two calculations , we found these occupied energies to be different for all the solids we have studied to date @xcite , including srtio@xmath0 .",
    "the basis set for calculation ii is then augmented in order to carry out self - consistent calculation iii .",
    "again , the occupied energies from calculations ii and iii are compared .",
    "this process of augmenting the basis set and of performing self - consistent calculations is continued until the occupied energies from a calculation , say @xmath18 , are found to be identical to their corresponding ones from calculation ( @xmath19 ) , within computational uncertainties that are less than 50 mev .",
    "this perfect superposition of occupied energies from two consecutive calculations identifies the basis set for calculation @xmath18 as the optimal one , i.e , the smallest basis set that yields the lowest , occupied energies of the system .",
    "the attainement of this minima signifies that this basis set is verifiably complete for the description of the ground state of the system .",
    "larger basis sets that include the optimal one do not lower any occupied energies from their values obtained with the optimal basis set .    as explained elsewhere @xcite , these larger basis sets do not lead to any changes in the ground state charge density or the hamiltonian .",
    "however , larger basis sets that include the optimal one often lead to a lowering of some unoccupied energies .",
    "this lowering of some unoccupied energies can not be ascribed to a physical interaction included in the hamiltonian . up to the optimal basis set",
    ", changes in the basis sets lead to changes in the charge density , the potential , and the hamiltonian .",
    "hence , changes in occupied and unoccupied energies , for self - consistent calculations with basis sets up to the optimal one , can be ascribed to a physical interaction embedded in the kohn - sham hamiltonian .",
    "the system of equations in dft totally determines changes in the occupied states .",
    "it also determines , at least in part , low - laying unoccupied states that are interacting with the occupied ones , up to the optimal basis set .",
    "for example , in wurtzite inn , the calculated dielectric functions agree with their corresponding experimental ones up to 5.5 - 6.0 ev @xcite .",
    "given that only direct transitions were taken into account in our dielectric functions calculations , this agreement indicates that the low - laying unoccupied bands were correctly determined . for larger basis sets that include the optimal one ,",
    "the extra lowering of some _ unoccupied energies _ is a direct consequence of the rayleigh theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that when an eigenvalue equation is solved with basis sets i and ii , with set ii larger than i and including i entirely , then the eigenvalues obtained with set ii are lower than or equal to their corresponding ones obtained with basis set i @xcite .",
    "the above process entails iterations for the equation giving the ground state charge density , with the iterations for the kohn - sham equation carried out for each choice of the basis set .",
    "given that iterations for the kohn - sham ( ks ) equation involves the charge density ( cd ) equation , one could conclude that a single trial basis set calculation solves both equations self consistently .",
    "a problem with this view stems from the fact that any two such calculations , with different trial basis sets , lead to different , converged ( i.e. , self consistent ) eigenvalues of the ks equation .",
    "the fundamental theorem of algebra suffices to guarantee that the two sets will be different if the basis sets have different numbers of basis functions utilized in the expansions .",
    "the question then arises as to which of the two sets of eigenvalues of the ks equation provides the physical description of the system under study . to answer such a question",
    "definitively and from first principle , the bzw method follows the process described above . upon reaching the optimal basis set , not only the charge density ,",
    "the potential , and the hamiltonian no longer change ( i.e. , they have converged ) , but also the resulting , self - consistent eigenvalues of the ks equation have reached their respective minima , for the occupied states . in our understanding , to solve the system of equation self - consistently means obtaining converged eigenvalues ( attainable with most arbitrary basis set ) but also @xmath20 that have reached their respective minima ( attainable with bzw method ) .    in the above sense , the bzw method solves self - consistently not just the kohn - sham equation , but also the equation giving the ground state charge density in terms of the wave functions of the occupied states .",
    "further , in his nobel lecture @xcite , kohn noted the `` density optimal '' feature of the wave functions from correctly performed dft calculations while those for the hartree fock approach are `` total - energy optimal . '' without a constrained search for the converged ground state , it is quite difficult to infer the basis set that yields the correct ground state charge density @xcite .",
    "this point becomes clearer by noting that the reorganization of the cloud of valence electrons is drastically different for atomic or ionic species as compared to molecules or solids .",
    "for instance , _ single trial basis set calculations can not make up for any deficiency in the angular symmetry of the functions , irrespective of the degree of convergence of the iterations of the kohn - sham equation_. by correct ground state charge density , we mean the charge density that leads to the minima of all the occupied energies .    in this work ,",
    "we utilize the electronic structure package from the ames laboratory of the us department of energy ( doe ) , ames , iowa @xcite .",
    "we employ the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) potential given by  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "we utilize sets of even tempered gaussian functions with exponents from 0.12 to 10@xmath21 to form the atomic wavefunctions .",
    "there are 15 , 15 , and 13 @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath3 orbitals , respectively , for sr , while 17 , 17 , and 15 @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath3 orbitals , respectively , are used for both ti and o. the charge fitting error using the gaussian functions in the atomic calculation is about 10@xmath24 .",
    "since the deep core states are fully occupied and are inactive chemically , the charge densities of the deep core states were kept the same as in the free atom .",
    "however , the core states of low binding energy were still allowed to fully relax , along with the valence states , in the self consistent calculations .",
    "the orbitals employed in the self - consistent calculations are between paranthesis for sr ( 3@xmath3 4@xmath22 4@xmath23 4@xmath3 5@xmath22 ) , ti ( 3@xmath23 3@xmath3 4@xmath22 ) and o ( 2@xmath22 2@xmath23 3@xmath22 ) , including some that are unoccupied in the free atoms or ions .",
    "these unoccupied orbitals are included in the self - consistent lcao calculation to allow the restructuring of the electronic cloud , including possible polarization , in the crystal environment .",
    "the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration for the charge density in the self consistent procedure is based on 56 special k points in the irreducible brillouin zone ( ibz ) . the computational error for the valence charge is 5.3 x 10@xmath25 ev per valence electron .",
    "the self consistent potential converged to a difference of 10@xmath25 after several tenths of iterations . the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions",
    "are then solved at 161 special k points in the ibz for the band structure .",
    "a total of 152 weighted k points , chosen along the high symmetry lines in the ibz of srtio@xmath0 , are used to solve for the energy eigenvalues from which the electron density of states ( dos ) are calculated using the linear analytical tetrahedron method @xcite .",
