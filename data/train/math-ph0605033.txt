    "for any observed system , physical or otherwise , one generally wishes to make predictions on its future evolution .",
    "sometimes , very little is known about the system .",
    "possibly , the dynamics behind the phenomenon being studied is unknown , and one is given just a time series of one ( or a few ) of its parameters .",
    "therefore , performing a time - series analysis is the best one can do in order to learn the properties of the phenomenon .",
    "its relevance may be gauged by the existence of extensive studies in a great diversity of branches of knowledge , in physics as well as in economics and the stock exchange , meteorology , oceanography , medicine , etc .",
    "a time series is normally taken as a set of numbers that are the possible outcome of measurements of a given quantity , taken at regular intervals . in reality , however , the assumption that the time series reflects in some way the underlying dynamics of the systems is worsened by the fact that the measured data usually contain irregularities .",
    "these may be due to a random external influence on a linear system , a noise ( induced possibly by the measuring apparatus or other sources of contamination ) which gets mixed with the desired information , thereby hiding it .",
    "but it may well be that they appear as a manifestation of low - dimensional deterministic chaos resulting from an intrinsic nonlinear dynamics governing the quantity under study ( over which a random noise may also be superimposed ) , with the characteristic sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "if the time series is the only source of information on the system , prediction of the future values of the series requires a modelling of the system s ( perhaps nonlinear ) dynamical law through a set of differential equations or through discrete maps .",
    "however , it is even possible that we do not know whether the measured quantity is the only relevant degree of freedom ( frequently it is not ) of the dynamical problem , nor how many of them there are .",
    "both noise - contaminated linear and nonlinear systems have nevertheless been studied with success employing statistical tools , chaos - theory concepts , together with time - series analysis @xcite .",
    "given a time series , one should ask first whether it represents a causal process or whether it is stochastic .",
    "tools have been developed to decide upon this fundamental question ( the most common ones are spectral analysis , lyapunov characteristic exponents and correlation functions , see @xcite ) . in the case of a series originated from a low - dimensionality chaotic dynamics , traditional linear methods of analysis",
    "are not adequate , but an analysis apparatus was devised for applications to such nonlinear systems @xcite and we will not be concerned with stochastic processes in this paper .",
    "methods for dealing with nonlinear time series fall mainly into two categories : local or global methods .",
    "local methods are based on the assumption that , while in the long run nearby trajectories on the phase space diverge considerably , they stay within the same neighborhood for a while .",
    "one may conjecture that to predict the next step in a time series , a good indication should come from the previous visits the system had made to the phase space neighborhood containing the `` last point '' of the series .",
    "an average of the behavior of the system for neighboring points , with a minimization of the distance in the phase space between them , gives good results for the next - step forecasting .",
    "global methods , on the other hand , postulate a functional form for the dynamics to be valid for any time . usually one considers polynomials of a suitable degree and one should devise a convenient way to estimate its coefficients . in this paper , we are going to concentrate in the global approach and , actually , we will start from the global mapping itself , i.e. , we are not going to be concerned with how the global mapping was generated ( there are many standard approaches to do it ) and we will not deal with noise reduction either ( such considerations are important when determining the mappings , etc . ) .",
    "we will focus on a new method to , from any standard mapping one might have , improve the forecasting using it , without having to pay a very high computational price .",
    "nonlinear analysis of time series relies not on the original maps of the dynamic system , but on its _ time - delay reconstruction_. all discussions on the nonlinear treatment of time series make use of this reconstruction scheme .",
    "there are already classical references dealing with the subject @xcite .",
    "this method allows one to reconstruct the phase space of the system with reasonable accuracy , using the information contained in the series only .",
    "lorenz @xcite showed that dynamic systems of low dimensionality could present strange attractors on their phase spaces .",
    "takens @xcite proposed a method to reconstruct such phase spaces from the knowledge of a time series obtained from the system .",
    "he demonstrated that the original attractor and the reconstructed one are characterized by the same asymptotic properties and topological characteristics @xcite .",
    "so , if we want to analyze the properties of the corresponding attractor of the system we have to reconstruct it .    in @xcite , takens used a method to reconstruct the phase space .",
    "vectors @xmath0 ( with dimension `` m '' ) are reconstructed from the time series @xmath1 where @xmath2,@xmath3 as follows : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the embedding dimension and @xmath6 is the time lag ( for definitions , see @xcite ) .",
    "based on the trajectories of the reconstructed attractor , we can study various topological invariants of the system such as the lyapunov exponents , the generalized entropies @xcite , etc .",
    "we can also extract the underlying dynamics via a global modelling of the system .",
    "for example , one can try to obtain a low order taylor series expansion for the system , thus obtaining a global mapping representing the system .",
    "we can use this mapping to perform a forecast of entries we ignore , i.e. , in the future .",
    "suppose that the system can be modelled by a set of differential equations of low dimensionality .",
    "what we would like to obtain is some kind of global map that , given any point of the phase space , could calculate a subsequent point of the trajectory . if we have known the set of differential equations ( sde ) that models the system , we could find a solution ( starting from an initial condition ) by making a numerical integration through some map obtained from the sed ( probably a runge - kutta map , a taylor series one or an expansion in some function basis ) . for practical purposes ( computers can not work with the infinity ) a truncation must occur at some order of the series expansion .",
    "however , if the truncation order is low , we can run away from the real solution in a few time steps ( even if each time step is very small ) .",
    "for chaotic systems it is not used ( in general ) a runge - kutta expansion of degree less than four .",
    "this implies that the map generated present polynomials of high degree .",
    "let s exemplify using one of the simplest chaotic system that exists , the lorenz system :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are parameters and the system presents chaotic behavior for @xmath11 .",
    "why _ one of the simplest _ ?",
    "notice that this system possesses the minimum number of autonomous differential equations permeating chaos : three .",
    "besides that , chaos is a phenomenon that only takes place in non - linear systems , and the smallest piece of non - linearity that we can add to a linear system in order to turn it non - linear is a quadratic term .    observe that the lorenz system presents only two non - linear quadratic terms . even in this simple case , as we will show , a taylor series expansion of fourth order , will lead to a map of fifth degree in three variables .    consider the following initial condition : @xmath12 .",
    "we can expand the corresponding solution as : @xmath13 since the system is defined by the equations @xmath14 we have that @xmath15 , represents @xmath16 . ] implying that : @xmath17    we can notice that , for the case of the lorenz system , this process will increase the degree of the polynomials forming the mapping by one for each order and @xmath18 is quadratic , the derivatives ( present on ( [ map1lorenz ] ) ) are , at maximum , first degree polynomials . ] .",
    "so , the mapping corresponding to the forth order taylor expansion is , at maximum , formed by fifth degree terms .",
    "a polynomial mapping of fifth degree implies a total of @xmath19 coefficients .",
    "please remember that , as mentioned , this is for one of the simplest chaotic dynamic system cases ( i.e. , three - dimensional and only two non - linear ( quadratic ) terms ) .",
    "it is important to notice that , in time series analysis , we do not have the dynamic system to begin with .",
    "we , of course , will consider that there is such a system behind the series and we will look for determining it . with the explanations above , we hope to have made it clear that , even if the underlying system is as simple as the lorenz s one , we will already have to face a great computational task ( if one wants to use forth order expansions - generally the minimum accuracy necessary for practical purposes ) of determining the @xmath19 coefficients .",
    "with more detail , using the lorenz system as a model for the global fitting scheme , let us suppose that we have a time series produced from this system ( for instance , take one of the coordinates of the system ) .",
    "after the usual phase space reconstruction @xcite , say we want to have a fourth order mapping ( for the reconstructed system ) with the same accuracy that could be found on the fourth order taylor expansion for the lorenz system .",
    "we would have to employ some minimization technique to determine @xmath19 coefficients . in practice , this is a very high number making the whole procedure computationally expensive .",
    "so , we are left with the hard choice of : either pay the computational price mentioned above and be very patient or try and decrease the degree of the mapping .",
    "of course , there is no such thing as a free meal .",
    "the price for the latter choice would be that the accuracy would decrease ( the corresponding taylor expansion would be of lower order ) .    therefore , despite the fact that the global approach has many attractive features , such as the fact that , once it is determined it is applicable to the whole series , one sees that the effective use of it can be difficult to achieve in practice .",
    "so , there is a clear demand for procedures that can , without increasing the degree of the global mapping , enhance the accuracy of such mappings . in the next subsection , before introducing one such attempt , we will talk about mappings .      in order to clarify the central idea of our proposed algorithm ,",
    "let us make some comments and present some results concerning mappings representing the solutions for sdes .",
    "consider the transformation group in @xmath20 variables : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the group parameter . from lie s theory @xcite , we know that this group is the solution to a sde defined by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the transformation group ( [ grupodetransf ] ) ( i.e. , the solution to the dynamic system ( [ eqdifdogrupo ] ) ) can be obtained from the group generator defined as the operator @xmath26 , as follows :    @xmath27+{\\frac{t^{2}}{2 ! } } { \\it x}^{2}[x_i]+ \\cdots = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{\\frac{t^{k}}{k!}}{\\it x}^{k}[x_i].\\ ] ]    in this way , starting from a generic point @xmath28 , with corresponding coordinates @xmath29 , by choosing a time interval @xmath30 , the transformation group ( [ grupodetransf ] ) generates a mapping @xmath31 that takes a point on some given solution to the system and takes it to another such point that corresponds to a group parameter increased by @xmath30 @xmath32.\\ ] ] in practice , the process of numerically solving the sde can be summarized by choosing a small time interval ( @xmath33 ) and truncating the series ( [ mapasolu ] ) at some order @xmath34 , thus obtaining a mapping @xmath35 given by : @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 approaches @xmath38 when @xmath39 . defining the functions @xmath40 as    @xmath41 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\left ( \\delta \\varepsilon_i(\\vec{x}_{(p)})\\right .    &",
    "= & \\left .",
    "\\delta^1 \\varepsilon_i(\\vec{x}_{(p ) } ) \\right )   \\equiv \\varepsilon_i(\\vec{x}_{(p+1 ) } ) - \\varepsilon_i(\\vec{x}_{(p ) } ) \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\delta^k \\varepsilon_i(\\vec{x}_{(p ) } ) & \\equiv & \\delta^{k-1 } \\varepsilon_i(\\vec{x}_{(p+1 ) } ) - \\delta^{k-1 } \\varepsilon_i(\\vec{x}_{(p)}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where ( k=2 ,  ) , one can notice that @xmath42 and , generally , @xmath43 since @xmath44 implies that @xmath45 , we can , using ( [ deltakep ] ) , enunciate the following result : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a positive integer .",
    "in the next subsection , based on this important result , we will present an algorithm that enhances the predictive power of global mappings for time series .",
    "based on the above result ( [ resultado ] ) , we have produced an algorithm that allows for improving the forecasting for the global fitting of a time series .",
    "as mentioned , we will suppose that the given time series is originated from phenomena that can be described by a low dimension dynamic system ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "after the phase space reconstruction @xcite , we have a set of vectors defining a set of points along a single trajectory of the reconstructed systems ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath49 are topologically equivalent . ] . as usual , what we would like to determine is a global mapping @xmath31 that would ( with infinite precision ) represent the solutions of the system @xmath49 .",
    "but , of course , in practice , what we can do is to produce a global mapping @xmath35 through a procedure involving a minimization process .",
    "if the mapping @xmath35 produces good forecasting for the series , that means that the coefficients present on @xmath35 are close to the analogous ones present on the mapping @xmath31 which can be represented by the infinite series ( [ mapasolu ] ) ( and , ideally , it would describe @xmath49 with absolute precision ) .",
    "in that situation , we would be in a similar position to the one presented on the last subsection ( where we had just a truncated series because we knew the underlying sde and could determine the taylor expansion ) .",
    "why similar ? in the `` real '' case we are dealing with now , we only have the series and have to determine the mapping through a finite process and , therefore , the coefficients would not be exactly the same as in the truncated expansion of @xmath49 .",
    "so , defining functions @xmath50 and @xmath40 analogously to how we did in the last subsection , we would expect that ( [ resultado ] ) would be valid .",
    "actually , in the real world , the inequality @xmath51 is not valid for any positive integer @xmath47 .",
    "the point is that , in actual calculations , @xmath30 would be a finite value ( not infinitesimal ) @xmath52 .",
    "so , at some integer value @xmath53 , the inequality ( [ resultadoreal ] ) would become @xmath54 the above reasoning allows us to build an easily applicable algorithm : consider that we want to forecast the coordinate @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 can take any value from 1 to the dimensionality of the reconstructed system ) of a point @xmath57 that immediately follows a given point @xmath58 . in order to produce the mapping @xmath35 , we use a certain number @xmath59 of points that precede the point @xmath57 ( the points @xmath60 ) . using this mapping",
    ", we can forecast the @xmath55 coordinates for these @xmath59 points .",
    "let us call these @xmath59 values @xmath61 . from these",
    ", we can define the functions @xmath62 ( analogously to the functions ( [ varep ] ) in subsection [ lie ] ) .",
    "@xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 . using these definitions",
    ", we can determine the values for @xmath66 where we have @xmath67 in which that happens .",
    "after a certain value , the @xmath68 start to diverge . ] and , using this knowledge , we will see that we can improve the forecasting generated by the mapping @xmath35 .",
    "let us clarify what we mean : if we want to forecast the value for the coordinate @xmath55 of the point @xmath57 , we may use the global mapping @xmath35 that would produce the forecast @xmath37 . we know that @xmath69 and , therefore , @xmath70 notice that we do not know the value for @xmath71 .",
    "but we know that @xmath72 , implying that @xmath73 let us examine this : we know the value for @xmath74 ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) but we do not know @xmath76 . however , if @xmath77 and @xmath78 are sufficiently close ( such that @xmath79 ) , we can expect that we will gain information when substituting ( [ del1 ] ) into ( [ pre0 ] ) obtaining @xmath80    why do we gain information ? if we compare ( [ pre0 ] ) to ( [ pre1 ] ) , we can observe that the unknown term in ( [ pre0 ] ) is @xmath71 which is ( by hypothesis ) much bigger than the unknown term in ( [ pre1 ] ) : @xmath76 .",
    "so , the term @xmath74 is a correction to @xmath37 .",
    "analogously , we have @xmath81 , implying that : @xmath82 substituting this into ( [ pre1 ] ) , if @xmath77 and @xmath78 are sufficiently close such that @xmath83 , we would have a second order correction to @xmath37 .",
    "actually , when the relation @xmath84 applies , we can further correct @xmath37 , i.e. ,    @xmath85    therefore , we can build a simple algorithm to improve the prediction @xmath37 , obtained with mapping @xmath86 : we determine the integer @xmath47 for which the approximation starts to fail , i.e. , @xmath87 , then we neglect the term @xmath88 and end up with @xmath89    the remaining question is : how to define @xmath90 ?",
    "let us elaborate the analysis just made above .",
    "we are interested in using an approximation , a kind of taylor series expansion , when trying to forecast the time series , what one might expect from such a situation ? in a perfect world , the terms in the series would , gradually , become smaller in an infinite fashion .",
    "of course , as already mentioned above , we are dealing with a real series , where each entry is not infinitesimally apart the previous one and is , actually , finitely separated .",
    "how `` finitely separated '' depends on the particular series under study and , being more rigorous , on the particular section of the series we are considering .",
    "this translates to the fact that , if one considers the absolute values of the differences @xmath91 , they will decrease with increasing values for @xmath47 until this value reaches the magnitude defined by the `` non- infinitesimal '' character of the time series we have just emphasized , where this character will then make the values for the differences oscillate ( for a while ) around this magnitude ( since this magnitude would dominate over the initial tendency of the differences to decrease ) . with the increasing values for @xmath47 , this initial tendency of the differences to decrease will cease as our approximation ( taylor like ) stars to diverge from the actual value for the series .",
    "we will then see the absolute values for the following differences start to increase and rapidly diverge .",
    "that clearly , if one thinks in plotting the ( absolute ) values for the differences , defines a plateau where @xmath90 and our above introduced method will work at its best .      consider that we have already reconstructed the phase space from the time series under study and that we want to forecast the @xmath57 entry ( @xmath58 is the last known value of the series ) .",
    "this entry corresponds to a coordinate of a reconstructed vector on the phase space ( as usual ) . using a global mapping @xmath35 ,",
    "obtained via standard k - fold validation procedures @xcite , we do the following :    1 .",
    "set @xmath92 .",
    "we calculate the absolute value for the functions @xmath93 ( see eq.([varepreal ] ) ) up to @xmath94 for the point @xmath58 .",
    "3 .   we check to see if we have already found the plateau , i.e. , we look for the value of @xmath47 for which latexmath:[$|\\delta^k\\varepsilon_i| <    very easily automatized .",
    "4 .   if the checking returns false we set n = n+10 and return to step 2 .",
    "otherwise we would have found the corrected value for @xmath38 as : @xmath96",
    "in this section , we are going to present two applications of the above introduced improved forecast method .",
    "we will start by introducing the time series in question , present the reconstruction parameters and the associated global mapping .",
    "we then will proceed to the algorithm , following the steps just introduced and compare the average performance for the `` usual '' and the improved approaches .",
    "this is an `` academic '' application in the sense that it is , certainly , originated from a dynamic system and we actually even know which one .",
    "but it is important in order for us to see the ideas of the improved method working on an arena that suits it very nicely .",
    "the time series was generated taking the consecutive values for the @xmath97 coordinate of the lorenz system ( see eq .",
    "( [ sistlorenz ] ) ) , starting from the initial condition @xmath98 , using an eighth order runge - kutta numerical integration@xcite .",
    "the series presents 600 entries ( please see figure ( [ lorenz ] ) for a plotting of this time series ) .",
    "now , in order to apply the global analysis ( @xcite ) to this time series , we have to reconstruct the phase space .",
    "to do that , we need to determine the relevant parameters , namely the time - lag and the embedding dimension ( please see @xcite ) . for this present case ,",
    "the reconstruction parameters are time - lag = 6 and embedding dimension = 3 .",
    "so , in the remaining of this subsection , we will call these three dimensions of the reconstructed phase space for the lorenz system @xmath99 . in real life ,",
    "we use the whole time series we know / measure to produce the global mapping and use it to predict future ( unknown ) entries . here , in order to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions we obtain using a regular global fitting and our improved one , we are going to use an initial portion of the series to generate the mapping and the other ( remaining ) portion of the series as our testing ground , i.e. , we will apply our mappings to entries in that region and compare it to the actual values to see how the mappings fared . in the present case ,",
    "the first 140 entries constitute our portion of the series used to build the mapping up . basically , we use all the vector reconstructed from these entries and produce a quadratic fitting minimizing the distances from this fitting ( when applied to each vector ) to the actual values via , for instance , a least mean square procedure .",
    "actually , we also have used an improvement ( a very standard one ) called a k - validation . in layman s language , basically what this k- validation does is to average up several mappings .",
    "doing all this , the global mapping we have derived ( and to be used on this application henceforth ) is : @xmath100      let us now , using two generic points from the series , exemplify the workings of our improved method .",
    "consider the entries @xmath101 and @xmath102 , with respective values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    "let us see how the `` usual '' global fitting fares in these entries",
    ". using the mapping presented on ( [ mlorenz ] ) , we get the following forecasting for the entries @xmath105 and @xmath106 : @xmath109 and @xmath110 . these present a `` percentage error '' ( given by @xmath111 ) of @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "how about the improved method ?",

    ", we see that happens for @xmath116 . using this into equation ( [ preapprox ] ) , we find ( see table ( [ lorenz_plateau_316 ] ) ) that the `` percentage error '' for our method is 0.0004798095",

    "as we have mentioned in section ( [ dalgo ] ) , we expect the absolute values of @xmath115 to oscillate when @xmath118 .",
    "that fact is illustrated , for the entries @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively , on figures ( [ 316 ] ) and ( [ 533 ] ) .",
    "the reader may ask : why these two entries above ?",
    "fair enough , they are not special at all .",
    "so , in order to confirm the fact that our new approach may be an advantage , let us make a general survey of the entries on the time series .",
    "we take 21 entries , equally distributed , on the last part ( not used when producing the global mapping ) of the time series .",
    "the results are presented on table ( [ comparison_lorenz ] ) .",
    "the idea behind of presenting the results for points equally spaced on the entire time series ( meaning the entire testing ground defined above ) was to provide the information on all the time series , i.e. , it is very important ( for many series ) the section in which the analysis is carried out .",
    "so , we have decided to present the results for many points , evenly distributed along every section of the time series .",
    "but , for completeness , we will present the average percentage error ( for the improved global fitting ) for the whole testing ground for the time series and for the 21 entries used on table ( [ comparison_lorenz ] ) .",
    "the percentage error for the whole series is @xmath121 and for the 21 entries on the table is @xmath122 .",
    "both are compatible , showing that the chosen 21 are representative of the totality of the possibilities .",
    "the percentage error for the `` regular '' global fitting is ( for the whole series ) @xmath123 .    as can be seen , our method is a great improvement of accuracy when compared with the `` plain '' global fitting . to help in this analysis we present figure ( [ lorenz_ln ] ) where we plot @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are , respectively the percentage errors in the global fitting and the improved global fitting .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , most of the igf errors are smaller than @xmath127 times the gf errors .",

    "the following time series was obtained from measurements of the heart beat rate in a person performing many different activities .",
    "the series presents 1744 entries ( please see figure ( [ heartbeat ] ) for a plotting of this time series ) .    in order to produce the global mapping for this case ,",

    "the idea behind of presenting the results for points equally spaced on the entire time series ( meaning the entire testing ground defined above ) is the same one explained on the section regarding the lorenz system .",
    "the percentage error for the whole series is @xmath141 and for the 26 entries on the table is @xmath142 .",
    "both are compatible , showing that the chosen 26 are representative of the totality of the possibilities .",
    "the percentage error for the `` regular '' global fitting ( for the whole series ) is @xmath143 .",
    "as can be seen , in the majority of cases , our method is , for this more `` realistic '' case , also a great improvement of accuracy when compared with the `` plain '' global fitting . to help in this analysis we present figure ( [ heart_ln ] ) where we plot @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are , respectively the percentage errors in the global fitting and the improved global fitting .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , most of the igf errors are more than five times smaller than the gf errors .",
    "there is a huge demand for improving methods that do not cost too high a computational price to achieve desired levels of accuracy in time series analysis .    here",
    ", we have presented one such method . the basic rational behind it is that we can make use , as explained in section [ algo ] , of the underlying ( assumed ) low - dimensionality dynamics to correct our forecast .",
    "it is important to mention that , in order to apply the method , one does not have to quantify the hyperbolicity ( or the low - dimensionality , for that matter ) of the time series .",
    "the steps of the procedure will take ( automatically ) care of stopping when this hyperbolicity `` spoils '' the correcting power of the method .",
    "so , the algorithm is secure .",
    "it is also useful to remember that our efforts here are aimed to avoid the computational cost of the fitting / minimizing procedures .",
    "so , our method is not equivalent to fittings , with the same computational cost , in any shape or form .",
    "we have presented two applications of our method : the first one is a ( we are going to call it ) pure low dimensional known system , from where we generated a time series .",
    "the reason for this application is to use the method on a controlled arena , i.e. , we can see the method working at its best .",
    "what do we mean by its best ?",
    "could not have we gotten better results than the ones presented in section [ app1 ] ?",
    "of course we could have , for instance , if we have made the time series more `` dense '' , i.e. if we have used smaller values for @xmath52 , of course , the results would be better .",
    "indeed , we can do the same indefinitely up to infinite precision .",
    "what we mean by `` its best '' is the fact that there is not , for sure , any high dimensional behavior .",
    "we have then demonstrated that the ideas behind our method work quite nicely .",
    "the second application corresponds to a time series obtained from measurements , i.e. , we do not have any prior knowledge about the ( possible ) dynamic system underlying it .",
    "we have found that , after the usual techniques have been used to produce the global mapping , we could improve the forecast capabilities of the fitting quite a bit ( see section [ app2 ] ) , thus demonstrating the practicality of our approach on a uncontrolled situation .",
    "our method has , of course , its limitations .",
    "perhaps the most obvious one is the fact that it wo nt help much in the case where the time series is `` sparse '' , i.e. , as we have mentioned just above , as @xmath52 becomes large , the method wo nt work .",
    "the limitation so far is that we do not have a criteria , as yet , to , just by quickly inspecting the time series , determine if our method applies well or not .",
    "one has to have a go and , in a testing arena , verify if the method is improving things .    that leads to future work :",
    "produce a fast algorithm to test the time series for applicability ( or not ) of the method .",
    "one other possible line of research to be pursued is to improve our algorithm in the sense of using more information contained on the plateau than we are using now .",
    "so far , we are taking the first piece of data on the plateau but , as we have explained in section [ dalgo ] , the values for the corrections will oscillate from that point on .",
    "it is reasonable to look for an algorithm to extract information from this oscillation .",
