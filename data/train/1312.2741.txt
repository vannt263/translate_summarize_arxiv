    "investigation of reactions involving weakly bound projectiles and the influence of their low binding energies on various reaction channels has received a fillip in recent years , especially in the context of the increasing number of radioactive ion beam facilities . to have a proper understanding of the influence of breakup of loosely bound projectiles on the fusion process , one needs to understand the mechanisms of all the competing reaction channels .",
    "measurements involving weakly bound projectiles , both stable and unstable , with @xmath0+x cluster structures show substantially large production cross sections for @xmath0-particles [ 1 - 9 ] , which indicate the presence of mechanisms other than the @xmath0+x breakup .",
    "_ showed that for the reaction @xmath5li+@xmath2 tb @xcite , about half of the @xmath0 and triton yield originates from the breakup - fusion process , which is more commonly referred to as the incomplete fusion ( icf ) process .",
    "evidence of transfer - induced breakup producing @xmath0-particles in the reaction @xmath5li+@xmath6cu has also been reported @xcite .",
    "our recent works on the systematic measurements of complete and incomplete fusion excitation functions for the reactions @xmath7li+@xmath2 tb and @xmath8b+@xmath2 tb @xcite have shown that the complete fusion ( cf ) cross sections at above - barrier energies are suppressed for reactions with weakly bound projectiles , and the extent of suppression is correlated with the @xmath0-breakup threshold of the projectile .",
    "the measurements also showed that the @xmath0-emitting channel is the favoured icf process in reactions with projectiles having low @xmath0-breakup thresholds .",
    "a critical insight into these measurements shows that the sum of the cf and the icf cross sections for each system yields the total fusion cross sections which lie very close to the calculated one dimensional barrier penetration model calculations , at energies above the barrier .",
    "this shows that the suppression in the cf cross sections at above - barrier energies is primarily due to the loss of flux into the icf channel .    a recent exclusive measurement on the reaction @xmath1li+@xmath9pb @xcite showed that the cross sections of the breakup process following @xmath4-stripping ( transfer - breakup ) of @xmath1li are higher than that for the breakup of @xmath1li into @xmath0 and _ d _ fragments .",
    "by contrast , another recent work on the reaction @xmath1li+@xmath10bi @xcite , aimed at disentangling the reaction mechanisms responsible for the large inclusive @xmath0-particle cross sections , indicated that the cross sections of the breakup of @xmath1li into @xmath0 and _ d _ fragments are much higher than those of the breakup following @xmath4- stripping of @xmath1li .",
    "however , very recently it has been reported @xcite that for @xmath7li induced reactions with @xmath11pb and @xmath10bi targets , projectile breakup is triggered predominantly by nucleon transfer , @xmath12-stripping for @xmath1li and @xmath13-pickup for @xmath5li .",
    "based on the observations made in a few reactions , it will perhaps be too optimistic to generalize the dominance of transfer induced breakup for all @xmath7li induced reactions , as the importance of a transfer reaction depends largely on the projectile - target combination . to conclude whether the observation is",
    "a general feature of @xmath7li induced reactions or is true only for specific reactions , it is important to carry out a systematic investigation of @xmath7li induced reactions on various targets , especially medium and light mass targets . in the background of this scenario we chose to carry out an inclusive measurement of the @xmath0-particles produced at energies around the coulomb barrier in the @xmath1li induced reaction with a @xmath2 tb target .",
    "the reaction was so chosen because detailed cf and icf cross sections have already been measured for the system @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1li beam with energies @xmath14=23 , 25 , 27 , 30 and 35 mev , from the 14ud barc - tifr pelletron accelerator centre in mumbai , was used to impinge a self - supporting @xmath2 tb target foil of thickness @xmath15450 @xmath16g/@xmath17 .",
    "the beam energies were corrected for loss of energy in the target material at half - thickness of the target . to detect and identify the @xmath0-particles produced in the reaction , four @xmath18e - e telescopes of si - surface barrier detectors",
    "were placed on a movable arm inside a scattering chamber of 1 m diameter .",
    "the thicknesses of the detectors were so chosen that the @xmath0-particles lose part of their kinetic energies in the first detector ( @xmath18e ) and are stopped in the second detector ( e@xmath19 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-particles produced in the reaction were measured in the range 30@xmath20 @xmath21165@xmath20 in steps of 2@xmath20 or 5@xmath20 depending on the bombarding energy , where @xmath22 is the scattering angle in laboratory .",
    "two si - surface barrier detectors , each of thickness 500 @xmath16 m , were placed at angles of @xmath23 20@xmath20 with - respect - to the beam direction for beam monitoring and normalization purposes .",

    "the angular distribution at each of the bombarding energies was obtained by considering the counts within the main peak of the @xmath0-spectrum . with the exception of the low energy 23 mev data , each of the distributions shows a clear maximum that shifts to lower laboratory angle with the increase of beam energy .",
