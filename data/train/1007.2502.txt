    "[ sect.i ] the exclusive semileptonic decay processes of heavy mesons generated a great excitement not only in extracting the most accurate values of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements but also in testing diverse theoretical approaches to describe the internal structure of hadrons .",
    "the great virtue of semileptonic decay processes is that the effects of the strong interaction can be separated from the effects of the weak interaction into a set of lorentz - invariant form factors , i.e. , the essential informations of the strongly interacting quark / gluon structure inside hadrons .",
    "thus , the theoretical problem associated with analyzing semileptonic decay processes is essentially that of calculating the weak form factors .",
    "perhaps , one of the most well - suited formulations for the analysis of exclusive processes involving hadrons may be provided in the framework of light - front ( lf ) quantization  @xcite . for its simplicity and the predictive power of the hadronic form factors in low - lying ground - state hadrons , especially mesons ,",
    "the lf constituent quark model ( lfqm ) based on the lf quantization has become a very useful and popular phenomenological tool to study various electroweak properties of mesons  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity on the lf quantization  @xcite is mainly attributed to the suppression of the vacuum fluctuations with the decoupling of complicated zero modes  @xcite and the conversion of the dynamical problem from boost to rotation .",
    "the suppression of vacuum fluctuations is due to the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation which correlates the signs of the lf energy @xmath13 and the lf longitudinal momentum @xmath14 .",
    "however , the zero - mode complication in the matrix element has been noticed for the electroweak form factors involving a spin-1 particle  @xcite . a growing concern is to pin down which form factors receive the zero - mode contributions .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to analyze the weak form factor @xmath1 , which has not been computed in our previous work of the semileptonic @xmath15 decays  @xcite . unlike the form factors @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath2 , which can be obtained from the plus component of the currents  @xcite",
    ", one needs to use the perpendicular ( or minus ) components of the currents to obtain @xmath1 . in this work ,",
    "we use the perpendicular components of the axial - vector currents with the transverse polarization to obtain @xmath1 and analyze the existence / absence of the zero mode .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the @xmath15 semileptonic decays using an exactly solvable model based on the covariant bethe - salpeter ( bs ) model of @xmath0-dimensional fermion field theory . in section 3 ,",
    "we present our lf calculation of the weak form factors in the @xmath11 frame and discuss the result in the @xmath18 limit for the analysis on the existence / absence of the zero - mode contribution to the form factors .",
    "especially , we identify the zero - mode contribution to @xmath1 and incorporate it as a convolution of the zero - mode operator with the initial- and final - state lf wave functions .",
