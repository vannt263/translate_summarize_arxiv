    "relativistic jets produced in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are thought to play a major role in shaping the co - evolution of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and galaxies via widely discussed , though still hardly understood , feedback processes ( see the topical reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most direct manifestation of the impact the jets make on their environment is the presence of cavities inflated in the intergalactic / intracluster medium at the position of jet cocoons ( or ` radio lobes ' ) , which are often accompanied by shock waves driven in the surrounding hot , x - ray emitting gas ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the more luminous the jets are , the more dramatic their influence is on the ambient medium .",
    "it has been argued in particular , that high - power jets are necessary to explain the observed properties of the central parts of rich clusters as due to mechanical gas heating by expanding lobes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these high - powers are equivalent to those in radio - loud quasars and their parent population of fanaroff - riley type - ii radio galaxies ( hereafter friis ) . yet ,",
    "most of the jetted agn found in the centers of nearby clusters are low - power systems , with large - scale edge - dimmed fri radio morphologies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one notable exception from this rule is the frii radio galaxy cygnus  a , located in the center of a rich cluster @xcite .",
    "this source is considered to be representative of high - redshift radio galaxies since in the earlier universe , when the bulk of the feedback process took place , powerful agn with luminous jets are being found also in dense environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )        in order to increase the sample of frii radio sources studied in nearby clusters , we examined the nrao very large array ( vla ) imaging survey of abell clusters with richness @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we found that within the redshift range @xmath11 and at the northern declinations visible to the vla , only two frii radio galaxies are hosted by brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in this sample : pksb1358@xmath12113 in abell1836 and 4c+67.13 in abell578 .",
    "for these two systems , we have re - analyzed archival vla maps , acquired new optical spectra using the william herschel telescope ( wht ) , and obtained new x - ray data with chandra and xmm - newton . in this paper",
    "we present the analysis of 4c+67.13/abell578 , which is a peculiar example of a cluster in formation .",
    "the companion study of pksb1358@xmath12113/abell1836 is presented in @xcite .    based on a detailed analysis of the velocity measurements for the cluster",
    "member galaxies , along with rosat pspc data , @xcite concluded that abell578 ( cluster richness @xmath13 ) is not relaxed , and consists of two interacting sub - clusters with a velocity difference of @xmath14  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the bcg is associated with the dominant cluster , and is the brighter of a pair of interconnected red spherical compacts as noted by @xcite and catalogued by him as cgpg 0719.8 + 6704 .",
    "the radio galaxy 4c+67.13 is hosted by the bcg and is characterized by an frii large - scale morphology ( * ? ? ?",
    "* designated as 0719 + 670 therein ) , and hence potentially by a high jet kinetic power . at the southern end of this dominant cluster",

    "note that despite its edge - brightened frii radio morphology , the studied radio galaxy does not obviously show compact high surface brightness hotspots at the edges of the radio lobes . with a total linear size of @xmath24kpc and axial ratio @xmath25 , which is typical for friis ,",
    "the entire volume occupied by the radio lobes is @xmath26 cm .",
    "the radio core of 4c+67.13 coincides with the bcg , which is the brighter member of the galaxy pair cgpg0719.8 + 6704 , and which is offset by @xmath27kpc from the position of the cluster center ( as inferred from the modeling of the cluster x - ray surface brightness distribution ; see  [ sec:2dfit ] below ) .",
    "the radio core of 4c+67.13 is distinguished by its inverted radio spectrum , with 1.5ghz peak of 8.4mjy beam@xmath9 and 4.7ghz peak of 12.1mjy beam@xmath9 .",
    "subtracting the estimated contribution of the core flux from the lobes , the 1.5ghz fluxes are 0.314jy ( eastern ) and 0.331jy ( western ) , and the 4.7ghz fluxes are 0.120jy ( eastern ) and 0.127jy ( western ) .",

    "the distance between the radio core of this source and the position of the cluster x - ray centroid is about @xmath35 , corresponding to 253kpc .",
    "although 4c+67.13 lacks clearly defined hotspots , and its radio luminosity is intermediate between fri and ii sources according to the often considered luminosity divide , it should nonetheless be classified as an frii radio galaxy .",
    "the original classification by @xcite is based on the ratio of the distance between the regions of the highest brightness on opposite sides of the radio core , to the total extent of the radio structure ; sources with this ratio greater than 0.5 are classified as friis ( `` edge - brightened radio morphology '' ) . in the case of 4c+67.13 , we obtain the ratio of @xmath36 for the higher resolution map from @xcite , and @xmath37 for the lower resolution map ( figure[vlaimage ] , left ) .",
    "the relatively low radio luminosity of the analyzed object compared with ` classical ' friis should not be considered as a surprise , as recent studies reveal the existence of a large number of friis near and below the classical luminosity divide @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation could be that the edge - brightened appearance of the radio lobes in 4c+67.13 is in fact only due to a special alignment of a ` narrow - angle tailed ' , i.e. intrinsically edge - dimmed radio structure viewed with its prolonged tails along our line of sight . that 4c + 67.13 was selected for study from a parent sample @xcite where the bcgs predominantly show clear fr i morphology ,",
    "would indicate an increase in the probability for such a special alignment .",
    "although we think it is improbable that both tails would be aligned in such a way that their extended diffuse radio emission is undetectable , and the resulting structure  characterized notably by sharp boundaries  appears highly symmetric in projection , we can not completely rule out this scenario .",
    "optical spectroscopic observations of the bcg hosting 4c+67.13 and its neighboring galaxy were obtained with the wht on 2010 april 21 .",
    "longslit spectra were taken using the intermediate dispersion spectrograph and imaging system ( isis ) double - armed spectrograph with a chosen slit width of 1  ( corresponding to 1.6kpc ) .",
    "the slit was centered on the nucleus of 4c+67.13 and was oriented along the position angle of the galaxy pair ( @xmath38 ) so data were obtained for both objects . to identify and reject cosmic rays , the integration time was split into two 900s exposures per arm .",
    "the average seeing fwhm during the observing run was about 0.8 .    in the blue arm ,",
    "the grism r300b was used and the detector was a thinned , blue - sensitive eev12 , array of @xmath39 ( 13.5 micron ) pixels with a spatial scale of 0.20pixel@xmath9 .",
    "the binning factor was @xmath40 which yielded a wavelength coverage between about 3300 and 5300 with a dispersion of 0.86pixel@xmath9 .",
    "the instrumental resolution was 3 ( fwhm ) corresponding to @xmath41kms@xmath9 . in the red arm ,",
    "the grism r158r with an order blocking filter gg495 was used .",
    "the detector was the default chip for the isis red arm , red+ , a red - sensitive array of @xmath39 ( 15.0 micron ) pixels with spatial scale 0.224pixel@xmath9 .",
    "the binning factor was @xmath40 which yielded a wavelength coverage between about 5300 and 9000 with a dispersion of 1.82pixel@xmath9 .",

    ".optical emission lines in the 4c+67.13 nucleus [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ par_spec_src ]    in the first attempt , the source ( 4c+67.13 nucleus ) spectrum was fitted by a cosmologically redshifted power - law model with the galactic absorption . the background model was fixed and the obtained best - fit parameters are listed in table[par_core ] . in this case ,",
    "the photon index of the power - law model obtained is quite large ( @xmath43 ) , and this model does not provide a very good fit ( _ c_-stat@xmath44 ) due to a prominent excess around 1kev in the data .",
    "we have therefore added an additional thermal component to the fitted source spectrum ( consistently with the analysis results for liner sources in general ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , obtaining this time an acceptable fit with _",
    "c_-stat@xmath45 ( see table[par_core ] ) and a more reasonable photon index of @xmath46 . the resulting temperature of the additional thermal component is @xmath47kev and the normalization of the power - law component is @xmath48photonkev@xmath9@xmath49s@xmath9 .",
    "the total nuclear 210kev flux in the source rest frame is @xmath50erg@xmath49s@xmath9 , corresponding to the isotropic luminosity of @xmath51ergs@xmath9 .",
    "this is consistent with the bolometric accretion - related luminosity @xmath52 estimated in  [ s - opt ] above , assuming the bolometric correction factor of the order of @xmath53 , as in fact expected @xcite .",
    "the abell578 system provides an interesting insight into the widely debated cluster formation processes .",
    "velocity measurements for the member galaxies presented by @xcite indicated that this system is not relaxed , and consists of the two interacting sub - clusters .",
    "our analysis of newly obtained _",
    "data allowed us to confirm their results based on rosat pspc data for the dominant sub - cluster and to quantify them robustly .",
    "in particular , we found the ellipticity parameter for the cluster x - ray atmosphere @xmath54 ( i.e. , elongated east - west ) , and an offset of about @xmath55kpc between the bcg which hosts the 4c+67.13 radio galaxy and the centroid of the cluster x - ray emission ( inferred from the two - dimensional fitting of the surface brightness distribution of the diffuse emission component ) .",
    "similar displacements have been found in a substantial number of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated that the distribution of the projected spatial offsets is a steep power - law function of cluster radius with a median value of about 10kpc .",
    "the displacement we found for abell578/4c+67.13 is therefore larger than in most clusters although not as extreme as in some other cases ( such as , e.g. , coma cluster with @xmath56kpc ) , and is also smaller than the abell578 cluster core radius @xmath57kpc ( evaluated here for the assumed @xmath58-profile with best - fit index @xmath59 ) .",
    "the position of the bcg with respect to the x - ray centroid of the cluster is considered a measure of the evolutionary state of a system . in particular ,",
    "these offsets imply deviations from the dynamical equilibrium at earlier stages of a cluster formation via hierarchical merging ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the presence of the offsets generally supports the idea that bcgs are formed via galaxy mergers in one of the infalling groups prior to the cluster assembly ( see the discussion in , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in this context",
    ", we note that the bcg studied here is a member of the galaxy pair cgpg 0719.8 + 6704 ( @xmath60-band magnitudes of 13.6 and 14.8 ) , with the projected separation of about 10kpc , and with no or only little young stellar populations .",
    "the performed optical spectroscopy allowed us also to estimate the black hole masses ( from the observed velocity dispersion ) for the two members of the pair as @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the analysis of the emission lines indicated moreover that both galactic nuclei are active , albeit at a low level ( liner - type agn ) , with the corresponding nuclear luminosities of @xmath63ergs@xmath9 .",
    "however , only the brighter member of the pair is radio - loud .",
    "the accretion rate for the 4c+67.13 host is relatively low , namely @xmath64  @xmath65  @xmath66yr@xmath9  @xmath67 , assuming the radiative efficiency of the accretion disk @xmath68 ( following * ? ? ?",
    "this is comparable to the accretion rate derived by @xcite for the analogous radio galaxy pksb1358@xmath12113 located at the center of the abell1836 cluster .",
    "despite such a limited accretion rate , both agn are able to launch luminous jets surrounded by frii - type radio lobes .",
    "interestingly , the _ maximum _ jet kinetic power in the source studied here , for the given accretion rate as estimated above , reads as @xmath69ergs@xmath9 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indeed is in the range of the jet kinetic luminosities typically derived for `` classical '' friis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we note , on the other hand , that it is quite plausible that the nuclear accretion rate in 4c+67.13 has dropped significantly since the onset of the jet activity in the source , i.e. during the last @xmath70myr . and",
    "in fact , the lack of prominent hotspots at the edges of the radio lobes could be considered as an indication for a recently quenched / suppressed jet production in the system ( due to a sudden decrease in the accretion rate ) , since jet termination shocks in frii - type radio galaxies are expected to die out almost immediately ( i.e. , on the timescales of @xmath71yr ) after the supply of the jet momentum ceases ( see in this context the discussion in * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "if correct , this could suggest in general a highly modulated jet duty cycle of bcgs , consisting of short but intense ( `` frii - like '' ) episodes of the enhanced jet activity , separated by the extended ( `` fri - like '' ) periods of a quiescence / low - level activity .",
    "lcc parameter & +   + model & power - law & power - law+apec + photon index & @xmath72 & @xmath73 + norm & @xmath74 & @xmath75 + kt [ kev ] &  & @xmath76 + norm &  & @xmath77 + reduced _",
    "c_-stat / dof & @xmath78 & @xmath79 +   + abundance & + kt [ kev ] & + norm & + reduced _",
    "c_-stat / dof & +    [ par_core ]    in this context , we note that the existing scaling relations between the jet kinetic power and the lobes radio luminosity for radio galaxies located at the centers of galaxy clusters have been derived assuming a relatively slow ( sonic ) expansion of the jet cocoons in a pressure equilibrium with the surrounding cluster gas @xcite . when applied to 4c+67.13 , these relations give in particular @xmath80ergs@xmath9 .",
    "the main assumption involved here may however be justified only in the case of fri systems , but not frii - type radio sources which likely expand with supersonic velocities ; with such a rapid expansion , leading to the formation of bow - shocks in the surrounding intracluster medium , the jet kinetic power should be therefore larger than the corresponding value of @xmath81 .",
    "our _ chandra _ data do not provide any _ direct _ evidence for the presence of a shock driven in the center of abell578 by a supersonic expansion of the 4c+67.13 lobes , but this may only be due to the limited photon statistics . instead , our detailed analysis of the available x - ray maps did reveal that the cluster gas in the vicinity of 4c+67.13 seems to be compressed by a factor of about 1.4 ( i.e. , the gas number density increased by this factor ) and heated ( from @xmath82kev up to @xmath83kev ) , consistent with a weak , @xmath84 shock driven by the expanding jet cocoon .",
    "analogous weak shocks have been found in much deeper _ chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ exposures of several rich clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and further , often tentative detections have been reported for a number of other ( poorer ) systems , including pksb1358@xmath12113 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "one should keep in mind , at the same time , that the aforementioned limited photon statistics following from a rather short _",
    "chandra _ exposure of a relatively low - luminosity system , precludes us from making definite statements on the precise gas density and temperature structure in the central parts of abell578 .",
    "in particular , it is plausible that the elongated x - ray core of the cluster , together with the large offset between the position of the bcg and the x - ray centroid inferred from the modeling of the diffuse emission component , are related instead to the sloshing of the intracluster medium triggered by the ongoing merger processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . only very deep",
    "follow - up observations of the studied system can resolve this issue by revealing directly the surface brightness and temperature discontinuities consistent with `` cold fronts ''  expected in the case of a gas sloshing  rather than weak shocks ( see in this context * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    altogether , the multifrequency data gathered here for the abell578 cluster reveal an insightful snap - shot of a complex system in formation . at its present stage",
    ", it appears that the cluster galaxies and intracluster gas are falling onto the center of the cluster potential , evolving slowly toward a dynamical equilibrium , while the cluster atmosphere is heated gently by the radio jets / lobes produced with high efficiency in the low - accretion rate nucleus of the brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "the overall cluster luminosity @xmath85ergs@xmath9 and temperature @xmath86kev are on the other hand unexceptional , being consistent with the x - ray luminosity - temperature correlation established for clusters and groups of galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
