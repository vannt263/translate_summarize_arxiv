    "certain individual pulsar systems are especially well suited to studying these areas of astrophysics , and thus continued pulsar surveys to find these rare objects remain a major scientific driver in the field .    radio pulsars are found primarily in non - targeted , wide - area surveys such as the pulsar - alfa ( palfa ) survey at 1.4ghz , which began in 2004 @xcite .",

    "a dedispersed time series is produced by shifting the frequency channels according to the assumed dm value and then summing over frequency .",
    "when generating these time series , the motion of the earth around the sun is removed so that the data are referenced to the solar system barycenter , assuming the coordinates of the beam center .    the palfa ` presto`pipeline searches observations for periodic and impulsive signals up to a dm of @xmath210000@xmath5 .",

    "a dedispersion plan is determined by balancing the various contributions to pulse broadening that can be controlled : the duration of each sample ( including down - sampling ) , @xmath15 ; the dispersive smearing within a single channel , @xmath16 ; the dispersive smearing within a single sub - band due to approximating the dm , @xmath17 ; and the dispersive smearing across the entire observing band due to the finite dm step size ( i.e. if the dm of the pulsar is half - way between two dm trials ) , @xmath18 .",
    "additionally , pulses are broadened by interstellar scattering , @xmath19 , which can not be removed .",
    "the amount of scatter - broadening depends on the dm , observing frequency and line - of - sight .",

    "because @xmath19 can not ( in practice ) be corrected , we ignore it when determining our dedispersion plan .",
    "the total correctable pulse broadening , @xmath24 , is estimated by summing the first four contributions in quadrature ,    @xmath25    all of these broadening terms vary with dm .",
    "the dedispersion plan is chosen to equate these four broadening effects roughly by adjusting the dm step - size and down - sampling factor as a function of dm . to reduce the number of dm trials , the step - size is never so small that @xmath26ms .",
    "the palfa survey dedispersion plan for mock spectrometer data was determined with a version of ` presto ` s ` ddplan.py`modified to allow for non - power - of - two down - sampling factors , and is shown in table  [ tab : ddplan ] .",
    "the down - sampling factors are selected to be divisors of the number of spectra per sub - integration , 15270 .",
    "the amount of dispersive smearing incurred at the middle of the observing band , @xmath21375mhz , when using the dedispersion plan in table  [ tab : ddplan ] , ranges from @xmath20.1ms for the lowest dms , to @xmath21ms for dms of a few 100@xmath5 , increasing to @xmath210ms for a dm of @xmath210000@xmath5 . above a dm of @xmath2500@xmath5scattering begins to dominate ( see fig .",

    "the second , _ high - acceleration _ search is optimized to find pulsars in binary systems . the time - varying line - of - sight velocity of such pulsars gives rise to a doppler shift that varies over the course of an observation .",
    "this smears the signal over multiple bins in the fourier domain . to recover sensitivity to binary pulsars we use the fourier - domain acceleration search technique described in @xcite . in short ,",

    "the next stage of sifting is to group together candidates with similar periods ( at most 1.1 fourier bins apart ) found in different dm trials .",
    "when a duplicate period is found , the less significant candidate is removed from the main list , and its dm is appended to a list of dms where the stronger candidate was detected .    at this stage , for each periodic signal , there is a list of dms at which it was detected .",

    "multiple trials , each with a different amplitude , were constructed , injected , and searched to determine the sensitivity limit at each point in ( period , dm , pulse fwhm ) phase - space . to reduce the computational burden ,",
    "not all possible combinations of parameters were used .",
    "in particular , only the profile with fwhm  @xmath23% was injected into all 12 observations .",
    "the remaining four profiles shapes were only injected into a single observation .",
    "this still permits the determination of the dependence of @xmath70 on pulse width .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the minimum detectable flux density of a pulsar depends on the intrinsic width of its profile , as well as the dm , because dispersive smearing and scattering broaden the profile .",
    "it is also reasonable to expect a reduction of sensitivity due to rfi and red noise , even with the red noise suppression algorithms employed ( see   [ sec : deredden ] ) . by recovering injected signals using the pipeline described in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we have determined the true sensitivity of the palfa survey , and its dependence on spin period and dm ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sensitivity_curves ] ) .",
    "we found the commonly used version of the radiometer equation ( eq .  [ eq : radiometer ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) overestimates the survey sensitivity to long - period pulsars .",
    "for example , for @xmath712.0s pulsars with dm @xmath72@xmath5(the majority of the pulsars we expect to find with palfa ) , the degradation in sensitivity compared with the ideal case is a factor of @xmath21.12 .",
    "we have also confirmed the claim by @xcite that the @xcite radiometer equation underestimates the sensitivity to high - dm msps , by not correctly modeling the distortion of the profile due to smearing and scattering .",
    "the more accurate variant of the radiometer equation from @xcite better matches our measured sensitivity curves in the msp regime , thanks to its inclusion of the profile shape and distortions .",
    "however , the degraded sensitivity we find at long periods is still not properly modeled with these adjustments .",
    "red noise present in pulsar search data due to rfi , receiver gain fluctuations , and opacity variations of the atmosphere makes it difficult to detect long - period radio pulsars .",
    "our analysis has shown that for the palfa survey , at low dms , the reduction in sensitivity already affects pulsars with periods of @xmath40ms .",
    "fortunately , the effect is slightly less significant for pulsars with higher dms .",
    "this is evident in figure  [ fig : sensitivity_curves ] .",
    "we have parameterized the sensitivity curves by fitting @xmath73 vs. dm with a quadratic function and modeling how these curves depend on period .",
    "to estimate @xmath70 at an arbitrary profile width , we first estimate @xmath70 at each of the five trial widths , then fit a quadratic function in @xmath73 vs. width , and use the parameters of the fit to calculate @xmath70 at the desired width .",
    "this ad - hoc scheme provides reliable estimates of @xmath70 within the intervals used for trial values of period , dm , and width , as well as for modest extrapolation .",
    "sensitivity maps for each of the five profile widths used are shown in figure  [ fig : sensitivity_maps ] .",
    "we have used the sensitivity curves determined above ( see   [ sec : sensitivity ] ) to re - evaluate the expected yield of the palfa survey by performing a population synthesis analysis with ` psrpoppy ` @xcite .",
    "galactic populations of non - recycled pulsars were simulated using the radial distribution from @xcite and a gaussian distribution of heights above / below the plane with a scale height of 330pc .",
    "the pulsar periods were described by a log - normal distribution with @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the pulse - width - to - period relationship was also taken from @xcite .",
    "we used a log - normal luminosity distribution described by the best - fit parameters found by @xcite , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we created 5000 simulated pulsar populations , each containing enough pulsars such that a simulated version of the parkes multi - beam surveys detected 1038 pulsars , the number of non - recycled pulsars detected by the actual surveys .",
    "we then compared the pulsars in each of these populations against a list of palfa observations80% of the central beam , consistent with the gains reported by @xcite . ] , and estimated their significance using the radiometer equation .",
    "pulsars with @xmath78 were considered detected was chosen such that the minimum detectable flux density coincided with the measured sensitivity curves for a duty cycle of 2.6% . ] .",
    "next , we compared the flux - density for each `` detected '' pulsar against the parameterized palfa sensitivity curves to determine if the pulsar also has a sufficiently large flux density to lie above the measured sensitivity curves . for each pulsar ,",
    "the measured sensitivity curves are shifted according to the zenith angle of the observation , the gain of the beam used , the sky temperature and the angular offset between the pulsar position and the beam center .",
    "we found @xmath6% of the simulated pulsars having fluxes above the theoretical sensitivity threshold derived from the radiometer equation ( eq .  [ eq : radiometer ] ) are not sufficiently bright to be `` detected '' by our measured sensitivity limits for the palfa survey ( e.g. fig .",

    "[ fig : popsynth - pdist ] ]    the number of un - recycled pulsar detections predicted for the palfa survey by @xcite is an overestimate for two reasons .",
    "first , their analysis used a threshold @xmath13@xmath84 .",
    "given the observing parameters assumed , a more appropriate threshold of @xmath13@xmath85 should have been used to correspond to the minimum detectable flux density we find ( @xmath86mjy ) .",
    "second , the analysis by @xcite did not include the effect of red noise , which we have shown reduces the number of pulsars expected to be found in the palfa survey by 35% .",
    "the detailed sensitivity analysis of   [ sec : sensitivity ] confirms that , on average , the palfa survey is as sensitive to msps and mildly recycled pulsars as expected from the radiometer equation .",
    "however , the survey is less sensitive to long - period pulsars than predicted .",
    "the degradation in sensitivity is between 10% and a factor of 2 for the majority of pulsars we expect to find in the palfa survey ( spin periods between 0.1s and 2s and dm @xmath87@xmath5 ) , and up to a factor of @xmath88 in the worst case ( dm @xmath89@xmath5and p @xmath90s ; this fortunately corresponds to a parameter space that contains far fewer expected pulsars ) .",
    "the reduction of sensitivity is likely caused by red noise present in the observations .",
    "the empirical sensitivity curves we determined apply specifically to the palfa survey , its observing set - up , and the search algorithms used .",
    "because the effects of red noise on radio pulsar survey sensitivity have the potential to be significant , as in the case of palfa , we strongly suggest measuring the impact of red noise on other surveys by performing similar analyses to what we described in   [ sec : injected ] .",
    "also , future population analyses should include these measured effects of red noise rather than assuming the theoretical radiometer equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when deriving spatial , spin , and luminosity distributions for the underlying galactic population of pulsars .",
    "what are the potential ramifications of reduced sensitivity to long - period pulsars being unaccounted for in population synthesis analyses ?",
    "first , the existence of radio - loud pulsars beyond the `` death line '' is important to our understanding of the radio emission mechanism in pulsars .",
    "for example , the existence of the 8.5-s psr  j2144@xmath913933 contradicted several existing emission theories @xcite .",
    "the existence of a larger population of slowly rotating pulsars , particularly the discovery of pulsars so slow that existing theories can not explain their radio emission , would further constrain models .",
    "it is also possible there is a larger population of highly magnetized rotation - powered pulsars and quiescent radio - loud magnetars that have been missed by the lower than predicted sensitivity of pulsar surveys .",
    "radio emission from three of the four known radio - loud magnetars was detected following high - energy radiative events @xcite .",
    "however , the other radio - loud magnetar psr  j1622@xmath914950 was discovered from its radio emission @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence that the turn - on of psr  j1622@xmath914950 at radio wavelengths was preceded by a high - energy event .",
    "the possibility that radio emission from magnetars is not always accompanied by x - ray or @xmath92-ray emission means it is crucial to understand the biases against finding such long - period pulsars . characterizing , and hopefully uncovering a hidden population of radio - loud magnetars , as well as highly magnetized - rotation powered pulsars , will help clarify the relationship between these two classes of pulsars , as well as the influence of strong magnetic fields on emission properties ( e.g flux and spectral index variability ) .    it may be possible to address the reduced sensitivity to long - period pulsars by utilizing algorithms that perform better in the presence of red noise , as well as algorithms that remove red noise without suppressing the pulsar signal .",
    "long - period pulsars may be found via their harmonics even if red noise obscures the signal in the fourier domain at the fundamental frequency of the pulsar .",
    "the detection of the pulsar signal will be reduced in two ways .",
    "first , the harmonic summing algorithm will exclude the power contained at the fundamental and low harmonic frequencies , which can contain large amounts of power , especially in the case of pulsars with wide profiles .",
    "second , by not being based at the fundamental frequency of the pulsar , the harmonic summing algorithm will skip slower , more significant harmonics in favor of weaker harmonics at higher frequencies . despite the reduction in sensitivity several pulsars",
    "have been found in the palfa survey thanks to their higher harmonic content .",
    "one suggested method of improving sensitivity to long - period pulsars is by using the fast - folding algorithm ( ffa ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the periodograms produced by the ffa , a time - domain algorithm , are generated from computing a significance metric from pulse profiles .",
    "thus , the broad profile features caused by red noise pose a problem for ffa - based searches . in short ,",
    "the ffa is not immune to the degradation of sensitivity to long - period pulsars described above .",
    "however it does have the advantage of coherently summing _ all _ harmonics of a given period and greater period resolution than the dft .",
    "these two factors should make the ffa slightly more sensitive to long - period pulsars , especially those with narrow profiles , than the fourier transform techniques described in   [ sec : periodicity ] , which is limited in the number of harmonics that can be summed ( typically incoherently ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ffa has only been used sparingly in large - scale pulsar searches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". a more systematic investigation and application of the ffa is warranted .",
    "another algorithm that might have better performance in the presence of red noise is the single - pulse search technique described in   [ sec : singlepulse ] .",
    "single - pulse search algorithms are known to be more sensitive than standard fft techniques to long - period pulsars in short observations @xcite .",
    "this is because of the natural variability of pulsar pulses and small number of pulses .",
    "pulse - to - pulse variability was not included in the synthetic pulsar signals used in our sensitivity analysis and no single pulse searching was performed .",
    "it is likely that the sensitivity curves determined in this work are partially compensated by the single - pulse search techniques already in place , especially considering the recent suggestion that pulsars with @xmath93ms have a greater likelihood of being detected in single - pulse searches than faster pulsars @xcite .",
    "however , the extent of this compensation depends on the pulse - energy distributions of pulsars and the relative significances of their detections in periodicity and single - pulse searches .",
    "we described the ` presto`-based palfa pipeline , the primary data analysis pipeline used to search palfa observations made with the mock spectrometers .",
    "this pipeline has led to the discovery of 41 periodicity pulsars and 5 rrats , the re - detection of 60 pulsars previously discovered in the survey ( using other pipelines ) , and the detection of 128 previously known pulsars .",
    "the ` presto`-based pipeline described here consists of several complementary search algorithms and rfi - mitigation strategies .",
    "the performance of the pipeline was determined by injecting synthetic pulses into actual survey observations and recovering the signals .",
    "we have found that the palfa survey is as sensitive to fast - spinning pulsars as expected by the theoretical radiometer equation .",
    "however , in the case of long - period pulsars , we have found that there is a reduction in the sensitivity due to rfi and red noise in the observations . the actual detection threshold for pulsars with @xmath3s at @xmath4@xmath5is up to @xmath210 times higher than predicted by the theoretical radiometer equation . we have performed a population synthesis analysis using this empirical model of the survey sensitivity .",
    "our analysis indicates that @xmath6% of pulsars , with predominantly long periods , are missed by palfa , compared to expectations based on theoretical sensitivity curves derived using the radiometer equation .",
    "the magnitude of the effect of red noise on the palfa survey s sensitivity to long - period pulsars is surprising and should be taken into account in future population synthesis analyses . furthermore , the effect of red noise on other radio pulsar surveys should be quantified in a similar manner and be included in population synthesis analyses to ensure the distributions determined for the underlying pulsar population are robust .",
    "the presence of more long - period pulsars could have implications on the location of the pulsar death line , the structure of pulsar magnetospheres and radio emission mechanism , as well as the relationship between canonical pulsars , highly magnetized rotation - powered pulsars , radio - loud magnetars , and rrats .",

    "<S> the pipeline presented here has also re - detected 188 previously known pulsars including 60 found in palfa data by re - analyzing observations previously searched by other pipelines . </S>",
    "<S> a comprehensive description of the survey sensitivity , including the effect of interference and red noise , has been determined using synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters and amplitudes injected into real survey observations and subsequently recovered with the data reduction pipeline . we have confirmed that the palfa survey achieves the sensitivity to msps predicted by theoretical models . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly used there is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods @xmath1ms that gradually becomes up to a factor of @xmath210 worse for @xmath3s at @xmath4@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath6% of pulsars are missed despite being bright enough to be detected in the absence of red noise . </S>",
    "<S> this reduced sensitivity could have implications on estimates of the number of long - period pulsars in the galaxy . </S>"
