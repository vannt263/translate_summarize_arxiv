    "it is surprising that , although it seems that noncommutative geometry is quite a pure mathematical object , noncommutativity does emerge in some definite limits of string theory .",
    "for instance , matrix theory compactified on tori gives yang - mills theory on noncommutative tori@xcite ; the quantization of open strings on a d - brane with a background @xmath1-field leads this d - brane world - volume to become noncommutative@xcite ; the twisted version of the reduced large-@xmath2 super yang - mills model originally considered as a constructive definition of type iib superstring can be interpreted as noncommutative yang - mills theory@xcite , and so on .",
    "recent development on string dualities reveals that m - theory rules nonperturbative features of superstring theories .",
    "it is natural to ask what is noncommutativity in m - theory .",
    "we do not know so much about m - theory .",
    "m - theory leads to eleven dimensional supergravity at the low - energy limit , and m - theory compactified on a circle becomes type iia superstring by taking the limit for the radius of the circle to become zero .",
    "moreover m - theory contains the two - dimensional extended object , m2-brane , as the fundamental component . matrix theory proposed by banks , fischler , shenker and susskind @xcite",
    "is considered as describing some ( or complete as they state originally ) degrees of freedom of m - theory .",
    "this matrix theory does show noncommutativity in some cases commented above .",
    "we can expect naturally that noncommutativity can emerge in m - theory .",
    "on the other hand , a supersymmetric two - dimensional extended object , called supermembrane , is interesting in its connection to superstrings . a quantum extension of supermembrane is expected to give a definition of m - theory .",
    "especially , it is well known that supermembrane in eleven dimensions can consistently couple to eleven dimensional supergravity as its backgrounds@xcite .",
    "thus , we have a natural question here ; how does supermembrane theory show noncommutativity ?",
    "it is a very meaningful question in two reasons .",
    "first , since we expect that supermembrane is a definition of m - theory , we also expect that supermembrane theory has noncommutativity in a definite limit or a background .",
    "secondly , we wonder what is noncommutativity in more than two - dimensional extended objects . to clear this second point , let us compare it with the string case",
    ". in string theory , the end of open strings becomes noncommutative and a d - brane world - volume on which open strings can end has noncommutative geometry .",
    "then , let us consider an _",
    "open membrane _ which has one - dimensional boundary and focus on the behavior of these boundaries . here , we face a conceptual jump . in string theory ,",
    "open string ends are `` points '' and on a d - brane world - volume points do not commute with each other , while in membrane case , we find that its boundaries are `` strings '' and noncommutativity means one - dimensional strings do not commute with each other .",
    "thus , we can learn a new feature of noncommutative geometry by studying membrane noncommutativity .",
    "a primitive analysis was carried out in @xcite .    in string theory",
    ", we can find noncommutativity by quantizing open strings in background ns - ns fields .",
    "some authors have applied the dirac procedure to boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "this method is very transparent and can be easily extended to other systems .",
    "we attempt to investigate an open membrane in a background three - form field in this way .",
    "it is well known that to investigate membrane theory has severe difficulties , for example , non - linearity of world - volume theory , non - renormalizability of three - dimensional sigma model , and so on .",
    "thus , we must take an appropriate approximation , as explained later .",
    "our plan of investigation is as follows . in seeing the noncommutativity , supersymmetry was not essential in the string case .",
    "we drop the fermionic parts and consider a bosonic membrane .",
    "we start with a bosonic open membrane in a constant gauge field background . since we should take our bosonic membrane as a toy model of eleven dimensional supermembrane , we restrict the background fields to the massless bosonic fields of eleven dimensional supergravity , the metric @xmath3 and the three - form tensor field @xmath4 .",
    "we consider only a bosonic background and drop the fermionic field , the gravitino @xmath5 . without introducing a two - form gauge field , there can not exist open membranes by gauge - invariance .",
    "also in supermembrane case , we can not introduce an open supermembrane without braking all the supersymmetries in _ flat _",
    "minkowski space - time .",
    "however we can formulate a supersymmetric open supermembrane when there exists a `` topological defect '' as a background @xcite .",
    "these defects are interpreted as , for instance , m5-brane , `` end of the world '' 9-plane in hoava - witten s sense , etc .",
    "we shall introduce fixed @xmath6-branes in this bosonic case .",
    "we assume our open membranes are bounded to these `` boundary planes , '' and there is a two - form field , to which open membrane boundaries can couple , on these planes - branes . ] . in these settings , we calculate the dirac brackets and confirm noncommutativity on these boundary planes . our calculation is only to second order in @xmath0 and not exact .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "setup ] , we propose our setup .",
    "we consider a bosonic open membrane in a constant @xmath0-field background .",
    "we suppose that one direction of the target space is compactified to a circle , another direction is compactified to an interval and there exist two fixed planes at the boundaries of this direction .",
    "we fix the reparametrization invariance of the world - volume with a static gauge and simplify the action by taking a limit .",
    "equations of motion and boundary conditions are found , we go on to the canonical formalism and impose the boundary conditions as constraints . in section [ sec : solve ] , we solve the constraints with an approximation .",
    "we take the radius of the compactification circle to be very large and the distance between the boundary planes to be infinitesimally small . in section",
    "[ sec : comp ] , we calculate the dirac brackets and confirm the noncommutativity on the boundary planes . section [ sec : conc ] is served to discussions and remarks . in appendix",
    "[ app : dirac ] , we review the application of dirac s procedure for constrained systems to the boundary constraints in the string case .",
    "let us consider an open membrane in the background of a constant three - form tensor field @xmath4 . we suppose that our membrane topology is cylindrical and the background is eleven dimensional , compactified to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a @xmath6 dimensional flat minkowski space - time and @xmath9 is an interval with a finite length are eleven dimensional suffices and @xmath10 represent the spatial directions of the @xmath6-brane world - volume .",

    "gauge - invariance requires that @xmath0 and @xmath40 always appear with the form of @xmath41 , so the constant @xmath0-field leads to a constant field strength @xmath40 on the boundary planes .",
