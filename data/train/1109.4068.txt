    "enhanced sampling tempering approaches , such as the parallel tempering ( pt ) @xcite and simulated tempering ( st ) @xcite , have played an important role in the study of complex systems such as spin glasses @xcite , protein folding @xcite , biomolecules and others .",
    "the basic idea consists of using the `` information '' obtained at high temperatures to systems at low temperatures , allowing the system to escape from metastable states and providing an appropriate visit of the configuration space .    despite this ,",
    "its efficiency depends strongly on the temperature set . in the last years",
    ", different procedures have been proposed for the choice of both the temperature set and the number of replicas .",
    "kofke @xcite has related the average acceptance probability of replicas @xmath0 with its difference of entropy .",
    "@xcite , based on the link between acceptance rate and specific heat , argued that the optimal distribution of intermediate temperatures should follow a geometric progression if the specific heat is nearly constant .",
    "kone _ et al_. @xcite proposed that temperatures in the parallel tempering should be chosen such a way that about @xmath1 of exchanges are accepted , when the specific heat is also constant .",
    "et al_. @xcite considered a feedback optimized parallel tempering monte carlo that gives the temperature set by measuring the replica diffusion through the temperature space . more recently",
    "et al_. @xcite introduced the constant entropy method ( cem ) , where the temperature of replicas is chosen provided the difference of entropy is held fixed .",
    "an advantage of both cem and feedback optimized methods is that near the criticality temperatures become more concentrated , what increases the frequency of the replica exchanges when compared with other schemes . results for the ising model @xcite revealed that they are equally efficient and superior than other schemes .",
    "however , the cem seems to be computationally simpler than the method by katzgraber _",
    "et al_. in this paper , we give a further step in order to ascertain the role of the temperature schedule in the parallel tempering .",
    "we consider a comparative study among five different schemes for selecting the temperatures to be used : arithmetic and geometric distribution of temperatures , arithmetic distribution in inverse temperature @xcite , @xmath2 distribution of temperatures and the cem . in the _ ad hoc _ ensemble ,",
    "temperatures are chosen in such a way that exchanges between adjacent replicas are about @xmath3 @xcite . in order to select the temperatures according to the cem",
    ", we use the transfer matrix method @xcite , in which the entropy is obtained directly from monte carlo simulations , hence avoiding numerical integrations of thermodynamic quantities , such as the specific heat and energy .",
    "we shall apply the comparative study to different lattice models undergoing phase transitions such as ising @xcite , blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) @xcite and bell - lavis ( bl ) water model @xcite .",
    "different analyses have been undertaken and for all schemes considered here the cem revealed to be more advantageous .",

    "usually one adopts only adjacent exchanges , since the probability of a given swap decreases by raising @xmath20 . in some cases , however , non - adjacent exchanges have revealed essential for the system to escape from metastable states @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we are going to consider different procedures for determining the temperature set .",

    "@xmath115 ( not shown ) and geometric schedules the tunneling is much less frequent than the cem ones , whereas for the arithmetic @xmath161 the systems gets trapped the whole simulation in a metastable state generated by the initial configuration .    as a final remark",
    ", it is worth mentioning that the observed differences in the results yielded by the various temperature schemes are less pronounced in discontinuous transitions occurring at high temperatures .",
    "in addition , by increasing both the number of replicas and the degree of non - adjacent exchanges the results also become closer .",
    "we presented a comparative study among different protocols for the choice of the temperature set in the parallel tempering method .",
    "we focused our attention on five criteria denoted arithmetic , geometric progressions in the temperature , arithmetic progression in the inverse temperature , _ ad hoc _ distribution and the constant entropy method ( cem ) . in this last case , we considered an alternative direct mc method for evaluating the entropy which avoids numerical integrations of the specific heat or other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we have considered rather few number of replicas ( @xmath143 for continuous and discontinuous phase transitions ) and adjacent and non - adjacent replica exchanges .",
    "different systems undergoing first and second - order phase transitions have been undertaken . in all cases ,",
    "the temperature selection via the difference of entropy method revealed more advantageous .",
    "more specifically , at the criticality ( where configurations generated by standard algorithms become strongly correlated ) the time displaced correlation functions decay faster when temperatures are chosen with the cem . this behavior can be understood that near criticality ( where a small change of temperature provoke a large change of entropy ) the cem gives more concentrated intermediate temperatures than all distributions .",
    "thus , replicas at the lowest temperature ( @xmath162 ) display a larger probability of exchanging configurations than the other cases .",
    "since the time correlation decays faster for @xmath163 than @xmath164 , the more frequent exchanges provide the system at @xmath165 decays faster . for discontinuous transitions at low temperatures , where high entropic barriers do not allow the system to cross the phase frontiers properly ( also when simulated by conventional algorithms ) and",
    "hence the choice of the adjacent temperatures may play a crucial role , the cem has also offered a rather efficient recipe for determining the temperature set . within the cem the lower temperatures are more sparse than with other schemes and , though unlikely , a successful replica exchange allows the system to evolve to configurations which are able to cross the high free energy barriers faster than other distributions .",
    "we have also distributed temperatures following an _ ad hoc _ scheme , in such a way that the exchange probability between adjacent replicas was about 30@xmath166 .",
    "although this method has shown to be more efficient than arithmetic and geometric schedules at the phase transition , it is inferior than the cem . in summary ,",
    "our comparative study ellects the cem as an useful tool for obtaining the temperature schedule to be used in numerical simulations of phase transitions through the parallel tempering method .",
