    "in the late 1960s , veselago firstly introduced the concept of left - handed material ( lhm ) in which both the permittivity @xmath0 and the permeability @xmath1 are negative  @xcite .",
    "veselago predicted that electromagnetic waves incident on a planar interface between a right - handed material ( rhm ) and a lhm will undergo negative refraction .",
    "theoretically , a lhm planar slab can act as a lens and focus waves from a point source .",
    "experimentally , the negative refraction has been observed by using periodic wires and rings structure  @xcite . in the past few years , negative refractions in photonic crystals  @xcite and anisotropic metamaterials  @xcite have also been reported .",
    "recently , pendry extended veslago s analysis and further predicted that a lhm slab can amplify evanescent waves and thus behaves like a perfect lens  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in a conventional imaging system the evanescent waves are drastically decayed before they reach the image plane . while in a lhm slab system , both the phases of propagating waves and the amplitudes of evanescent waves from a near - field object",
    "could be restored at its image .",
    "therefore , the spatial resolution of the superlens can overcome the diffraction limit of conventional imaging systems and reach the subwavelength scale .",
    "while great research interests were initiated by the revolutionary concept  @xcite , hot debates were also raised  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to investigate the paraxial beams propagating through an isotropic lhm slab .",
    "starting from the representation of plane - wave angular spectrum , we derive the propagation of paraxial beams in rhm and lhm .",
    "our formalism permits us to introduce ideas for beam focusing and phase compensation of paraxial beams by using lhm slab .",
    "because of the negative refractive index , the inverse gouy phase shift and negative rayleigh length in lhm slab are proposed . as an example , we obtain the analytical description for a gaussian beam propagating through a lhm slab . we find that the phase difference caused by the gouy phase shift in rhm can be compensated by that caused by the inverse gouy phase shift in lhm .",

    "( [ g3])-([r3 ] ) we can find that the intensity maximum locates at the plane of beam waist . the phase difference between the object plane and the image plane is independent of radial position , since the phase fronts are flat there .",
    "the new message in this paper is to prove that the intensity and phase distributions at object plane can be completely reconstructed at the image plane by lhm slab .",
