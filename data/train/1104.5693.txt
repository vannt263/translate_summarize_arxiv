    "since the earliest _ n_-body simulations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) established that bars can form in spiral disks , much theoretical work has been undertaken in order to understand their origin and evolution .",
    "theoretical models show that bars can be formed as part of the natural development of the system  @xcite . on the classical view , bars are mainly supported by elongated orbits ( called _ x1 _ orbits ) along the bar major axis  ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "chaotic orbits , however , can also support bars in disk galaxies  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "given that the stars that make up bars remain most of the time within them , bars , unlike spiral arms , are not density waves ( sparke & gallagher 2007 ; see also   [ spiral_origin ] ) .",
    "bars , however , can also be considered as long - lived waves and `` normal '' modes in the disk , possibly driving spiral structure  @xcite .    it has been predicted that single large - scale ( `` fast '' ) bars commonly end inside corotation  ( cr , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , also called lagrange radius  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this prediction has also been corroborated by observations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from these studies ,",
    "nonetheless , it can also be inferred that the bar s corotation radius lies between 1 and 1.4 times the bar s semimajor axis , and not exactly where the bar ends  @xcite .",
    "this may explain why some galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 1300 , ngc 1365 , ngc 5236 ) show dust lanes on the inside of the spiral arms and hii regions on the outside .",
    "_ if bar and arms have the same pattern speed , _ this makes sense only while spirals lie within corotation  @xcite .",
    "a crossing of the dust lanes from the inside to the outside of the arms , marking the corotation position , or an arm bifurcation are also sometimes observed .",
    "another theory postulates that `` slow bars '' actually end near the inner lindblad resonance  ( ilr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that they are formed by the alignment of elongated and oscillating orbits along the potential  @xcite .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , based on the results of numerical models  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , propose that bars in early hubble type galaxies ( those with high bulge to disk mass ratio ) end near cr , whereas those in late type galaxies ( with low bulge to disk mass ratio ) may end near the ilr , where the spiral arms begin  @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "`` slow '' rotating bars are not favored by the comparison of simulations and observations  @xcite , probably implying that disks in barred galaxies are maximal  @xcite .",
    "@xcite apply the potential - density phase - shift method  @xcite to a near - infrared ( nir ) subsample of the ohio state university bright galaxy survey  ( osubgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also fail to find evidence of the existence of `` slow '' bars .",
    "@xcite propose that multiple pattern speeds may be common  ( see also * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such that for some barred galaxies two corotation radii , one belonging to the bar and the other to the spiral arms , may occur simultaneously in the disk .",
    "this would imply that spiral arms are connected to bars only transitorily .",
    "the possibility also exists that the bar and bulge mask the spiral arms at small radii ; the arms would only start to be seen near the bar s end , creating the impression of a physical connection where there is none .",
    "unsharp masking and/or fourier - based methods can be used to search for spiral and bar perturbations in the inner parts of galaxies .",
    "however , ring - like features at the end of the bar may interfere with the unambiguous identification of a physical connection between bar and arms in some objects .",
    "@xcite perform simulations that confirm the scenario advanced by @xcite .",
    "they also find cases , however , where the bar and spiral rotate with the same pattern speed , as well as other cases where the bar and spiral patterns have different speeds but coupled resonances  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the bar s cr may overlap with the spiral 4:1 resonance or ilr , and the bar and spiral arms are indeed connected .",
    "various simultaneous spiral modes are also possible .",
    "according to  @xcite , barred galaxies can have  fast \" bars ( cr at 1 to 1.4 times the bar extent ) , and spirals rotating at the same or with a different pattern speed .",
    "they also consider `` super - fast '' bars , for which the bar s cr is well inside the bar s end and spirals are decoupled , although so far no theoretical models ( e.g. , n - body or response ) have produced a consistent system with cr within the bar .    observations also indicate that around 20% of early spiral galaxies are double - bar or nested bar systems  @xcite . in these systems , an outer or primary bar harbors an inner or secondary bar in the nucleus .",
    "the inner bar rotation is independent from that of the outer bar .",
    "there have also been suggestions of triple - bar systems  ( e.g. ngc 2681 , * ? ? ?",
    "it is commonly observed that giant hii region complexes occur at the end of the bar , where the spiral arms _ seem _ to originate  @xcite .",
    "not all barred spirals show this feature clearly , and they present @xmath2 emission in other regions as well , e.g. , along the bar  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposes that barred galaxies can be classified according to their star formation properties .",
    "galaxies with hubble type sbb and `` flat '' bars have scant star formation in the bar region and a concentration of hii regions in inner rings .",
    "star formation activity can be very high in the circumnuclear region .",
    "the second group corresponds to hubble type sbc and `` exponential '' bar type .",
    "this group has luminous hii regions in the bars , poorly defined rings , and less star formation in the circumnuclear region . in both sbb and sbc galaxies ,",
    "the star formation rates per unit area seem to be enhanced in the region where the bar joins the spiral arms , more noticeably in the sbb group .",
    "@xcite points out that sba galaxies tend to show star formation in ring structures , but no star formation activity in the bar and central regions  ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "according to @xcite , gas density enhancements perpendicular and at the end of the bar are often seen in simulations .",
    "she also notices that , for bars with `` straight '' dust lanes , star formation is difficult along the bar because of considerable shear ( the situation may be different for curved lanes / shocks ) .",
    "these `` straight '' dust lanes occur in strongly barred galaxies  @xcite .",
    "regardless of this ,  @xcite argue that some stars may be formed between the bar s end and the circumnuclear region . in their model ,",
    "stars are born in `` dust spurs '' on the trailing side of the bar that feed the main dust lanes .",
    "@xcite , based on @xmath2 , optical , and nir observations , find evidence to support this model in the barred spiral ngc 1530 .",
    "they suggest that stars are formed in the dust spurs and migrate across the bar to its leading side  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the existence of phase shifts between the @xmath2 emission , the old stellar component of the bar , and the co emission along it has been noticed by  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 leads both the co and old stars , although no systematic pattern with galactocentric radius is measured .",
    "these observations support the idea that star formation can be triggered in the bar region .",
    "if spiral arms in barred galaxies trigger star formation , then azimuthal color gradients must be observed across them  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , due to the aging of stars and their velocities relative to the spiral arms . in the cases where spirals corotate with the bar , inverse color gradients ( i.e.",
    ", the direction of stellar aging is contrary to the sense of rotation ) are expected .",
    "age gradients across bars have also been predicted by recent numerical simulations  @xcite . in the bar region ,",
    "the mechanism triggering star formation may be different from the one that sets off star formation in spiral arms , due to the diverse dynamics and shock conditions . here",
    ", we aim to investigate azimuthal color ( age ) gradients across bars and spirals in sb ( or strong sab ) galaxies , and the connection between these color gradients and bar / spiral dynamics . in figure  [ bar_grads ] , we show expected sites of color gradients ; in this example , the bar ends near corotation ( cr ) and spiral arms corotate with the bar , which is not necessarily always the case .",
    "our sample consists of 11 barred spirals , 9 of them classified as sb , and two as sab in the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies  ( rc3 , * ? ? ?",
    "statistics show that @xmath030% of spirals are strongly barred in the optical  @xcite . in the nir ,",
    "@xcite find that @xmath056% are strongly barred ( sb ) and @xmath016% , weakly barred ( sab ) .",
    "their study also shows that late type spirals ( sc - sm ) hold the same fraction of bars as early types ( sa - sb ) .",
    "optical and nir data were acquired during 1992 - 1995 with four different telescopes in three observatories : the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) 0.9-m and 1.5-m , the lick observatory 1-m , and the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 1.3-m telescopes .",

    "<S> we analyze optical and near - infrared data of a sample of 11 barred spiral galaxies , in order to establish a connection between star formation and bar / spiral dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that 22 regions located in the bars , and 20 regions in the spiral arms beyond the end of the bar present azimuthal color / age gradients that may be attributed to star formation triggering . assuming a circular motion dynamic model , we compare the observed age gradient candidates with stellar populations synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> a link can then be established with the disk dynamics that allows us to obtain parameters like the pattern speed of the bar or spiral , as well as the positions of resonance radii . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently compare the derived pattern speeds with those expected from theoretical and observational results in the literature ( e.g. , bars ending near corotation ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find a tendency to overestimate bar pattern speeds derived from color gradients in the bar at small radii , away from corotation ; this trend can be attributed to non - circular motions of the young stars born in the bar region . in spiral regions , </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath0 50% of the color gradient candidates are `` inverse '' , i.e. , with the direction of stellar aging contrary to that of rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the other half of the gradients found in spiral arms have stellar ages that increase in the same sense as rotation . of the 9 objects with gradients in both bars and spirals , 6 ( 67% ) appear to have a bar and a spiral with similar @xmath1 , while 3 ( 33% ) do not . </S>"
