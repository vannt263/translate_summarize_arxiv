    "it is now well established that the stack of josephson junctions formed by the atomic layers of high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) represents a nonlinear system with unique dynamic properties . a magnetic field perpendicular to the layers induces abrikosov - type pancake vortices in the planes .",
    "in contrast , a magnetic field applied along the cuo@xmath7 layers ( parallel to the @xmath6-planes ) creates josephson vortices , each carrying one flux quantum , and whose cores are located between the superconducting layers .",
    "when the parallel magnetic field exceeds the crossover field , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the flux quanta , @xmath10 is the anisotropy of the london penetration depth , and @xmath11 is the interlayer spacing , the cores of josephson vortices start to overlap and a josephson lattice is formed .",
    "@xcite at the same time , the vortex ground state and the vortex phase diagram of highly - anisotropic ( layered ) htsc in parallel and oblique magnetic fields remains the open question .",
    "the picture of a phase transition from a solid ( phase - ordered ) state to a liquid state of a combined lattice structure of josephson vortices and pancake vortices in high magnetic fields also remains unclear.@xcite    due to the proximity to the mott insulator , phase fluctuation are strong and the temperature of the superconducting transition , @xmath12 , in cuprates may be governed by phase fluctuations . in two dimensions , the phase fluctuations can give rise to a kosterlitz - thouless transition which is described by the thermal unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "however , there is no clear picture for the destruction of superconducting order in layered htsc via the unbinding of vortices .",

    "the observed power - law behavior , @xmath15 , with a characteristic jump in the exponent @xmath16 near the superconducting transition has been interpreted as evidence for the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "it is apparent that to gain a better understanding of the vortex ground state and vortex phase diagram in htsc , it is essential to understand the dynamics of josephson vortices . in the generally studied geometry , a @xmath17-axis external current drives josephson vortices in the direction perpendicular to both the current and the magnetic field .",
    "the driven motion of the vortices is responsible for the observed flow resistance .",
    "koshelev @xcite calculated the flux - flow resistivity of the josephson vortex lattice in a layered superconductor and showed that the magnetic field dependence of the flux - flow resistivity is characterized by three distinct regions . at low magnetic fields the flux - flow resistivity grows linearly with field . when the josephson vortices start to overlap the flux - flow resistivity crosses over to a regime of quadratic magnetic field dependence",
    ". finally , at very high fields the flux - flow resistivity saturates at a value close to the @xmath17-axis quasiparticle resistivity .",
    "a josephson lattice driven by a current along the @xmath17 axis , together with the resulting flux - flow resistance , has been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically because the coherent josephson vortices motion gives rise to strong resonant phenomena which may lead to very important applications of high-@xmath12 superconductors .",
    "@xcite in particular , the flux - flow voltage creates an oscillating current through the josephson effect and the current excites josephson plasma waves at terahertz frequency .",
    "part of the energy may be emitted as electromagnetic waves .",
    "@xcite under appropriate conditions , coherent motion of josephson vortices is possible and this can excite cavity resonances of the stack ( the fiske resonances ) , which in turn influence the vortex motion . such geometric resonances manifest themselves in the @xmath17-axis current voltage ( @xmath0 ) characteristic as a series of steps separated by a constant voltage .",

    "such oscillations of the josephson vortices flow resistance can be explained by a matching effect between the lattice spacing of josephson vortices along the layers and the size of the sample .",
    "it should be noted that in josephson - coupled layered superconductors , vortices exist for any orientation of the magnetic field . in the presence of an electrical current ,",
    "the lorentz force on vortices causes motion which generates both in - plane and interplane electric fields and which induces a flux - flow voltage drop across the superconducting sample . the sliding motion of josephson vortices along the @xmath6-plane is easily driven by a current along the @xmath17 axis . for a driving force exerted along the @xmath17 axis ( current in the @xmath6-plane )",

    "[ fig4 ] , a transport current flowing along the layers increases the effect of the lorentz force on the josephson vortices across the layers . due to the interaction with the boundaries of the sample , the period of oscillations in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] should depend on the size of the sample along the @xmath17-axis direction .",
    "the flow resistance shows periodic oscillations with period @xmath94  t which is very close ( within the accuracy of measuring the sample thickness ) to the estimated @xmath98  t , corresponding to the magnetic field needed to add one vortex quantum per layer in the crystalline lattice .",
    "here @xmath99 is the size of our strip single crystal along @xmath17 axis ( thickness ) and @xmath100  is the distance between the superconducting cuo@xmath7 layers in bi2201 .",
    "this result suggests that josephson vortices in bi2201 form a square lattice in the ground state . as before ,",
    "the oscillations are most prominent in the high temperature regime where thermal fluctuations reduce the role of background pinning and the crystal behaves as if it contained fewer defects than it actually does .",
    "we note that somewhat similar commensurate oscillations of the @xmath6-plane resistivity for magnetic fields nearly aligned with the @xmath6-plane has been observed on yba@xmath7cu@xmath67o@xmath68 single crystals in earlier work by gordeev _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "these oscillations are due to the oscillatory melting line separating the vortex liquid from the vortex smectic state and they are periodic in @xmath101 .",
    "this is very different from the periodic in @xmath102 oscillations of the vortex - flow resistance reported in ref .",
    "[ ] and observed here , which in addition are observed over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields below and above a melting line .      finally , it is pertinent to recall here a transport phenomenon which has its origins in a lorentz - force - independent dissipation that has been observed in strongly coupled layered bi- and tl - based materials.@xcite for this case the resistivity in the non - ohmic regime did not depend on the angle between the magnetic field and current when they are both parallel to the layers .",
    "the problem of an orientation - independent dissipation and the role of the lorentz force in the motion of the josephson vortex lattice can not be explained by simple flux - flow theory and is far from being totally understood .",
    "turning back to fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , we can suppose that the motion of the josephson lattice generates a traveling electromagnetic wave with the @xmath6-plane wave vector selected by the lattice structure .",
    "one might expect resonance phenomena when the velocity of the lattice matches the plasma wave velocity .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , if the motion of the josephson vortex lattice generates a voltage across the layers , one would expect that the current steps in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) are due to the matching of the josephson frequency with the frequency of the plasma mode .",
    "both mechanisms may result in the current steps in the @xmath0 characteristics .",
    "in summary , we have studied the in - plane @xmath0 characteristics and josephson vortex flow resistance in la - free bi2201 single crystals in parallel and tilted magnetic fields at temperatures down to @xmath4  mk . for parallel magnetic fields ,",
    "we find a power - law @xmath0 characteristic with a smooth decrease with magnetic - field of the exponent describing the power - law . at small angles between the applied field and @xmath6-plane , prominent current steps in the @xmath0 characteristics and periodic oscillations of josephson - vortex flow resistance",
    "are observed .",
    "while the current steps are periodic in the voltage at constant fields , the voltage position of the steps , together with the flux - flow voltage , increases nonlinearly with increasing magnetic field .",
