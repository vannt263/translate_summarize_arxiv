    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are a subclass of exploding stars defined observationally by the absence of hydrogen lines in their optical spectra and the presence of lines from elements such as silicon and sulfur ( leibundgut 2000 ) .",
    "there is consensus that sne ia are explosions of white dwarfs which occur when accretion from a companion star drives the white dwarf mass close to the chandrasekhar limit ( woosley & weaver 1986 , nomoto et  al .",
    "2003 ) . however , the details of the system are not fully understood , especially with regard to the type of companion ( a main sequence star , a red giant ) . a useful indicator of the properties of the companion is through its mass loss , which depends strongly on the stellar type . the x - rays and",
    "the radio regimes are especially well suited to study the interaction of the sn ejecta with the surrounding csm , which should be dominated by the companion s wind .",
    "however , no sn ia has ever been detected in either regime .    in this letter",
    ", we present x - ray and uv data for a sample of eight sne  ia observed with   between 5 and 132 days after outburst .",
    "the dates of outburst were estimated to be @xmath5 days before the peak in the @xmath6-band .",
    "the highlight of this study is the tentative detection of sn  2005ke in x - rays with  , which was discovered on 2005 - 11 - 13.33  ut with the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; baek , prased & li 2005 ) and later classified as an under - luminous sn ia from the presence of the characteristic 420  nm ti  ii and 635  nm si  ii lines ( patat & baade 2005 ) .",
    "a sample of eight sne  ia was observed with the xrt ( burrows et  al .",
    "2005 ) and uvot ( roming et  al .",
    "2005 ) instruments onboard the   observatory ( gehrels et  al .",
    "2004 ) , ranging from days to weeks after the outburst .",
    "multiple exposures were obtained in the @xmath7 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( 181321  nm ) , @xmath10 ( 166268  nm ) , and @xmath11 ( 112264  nm ) uvot filters and with the xrt ( 0.210 kev band ) in photon counting ( pc ) mode .",
    "the   data were analyzed using the heasoft ( version 6.04 ) and   software ( version 2.3 , build 17 ) tools and latest calibration products .",
    "x - ray counts were extracted from a circular region with an aperture of @xmath12 radius centered at the optical positions of the sne .",
    "the background was extracted locally from two neighboring circular regions of @xmath12 radius located at the same distances from the nuclei of the host galaxies to account for residual diffuse emission from the galaxies .",
    "a 14.8  ks  acis - s director s discretionary time ( ddt ) observation of was obtained on 2006 - 02 - 19 ( sequence 500693 ) , corresponding to day 105 after the outburst .",
    "the data were analyzed with ciao ( version 3.3.0.1 ) and the latest calibration products .",
    "this   data set on sne ia is unique as it represents the best sample of any sne ia observed in the uv . while the uv lightcurves are strikingly similar ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ,  shows a significant uv excess starting around day 35 after the outburst .",
    "a detailed analysis of the uv lightcurves will be presented in milne et  al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    the upper limits to the x - ray luminosities of sne 2005am , 2005cf , 2005df , 2005hk , 2006e , and 2006x are a few @xmath13 , implying mass - loss rates lower than a few @xmath14 for thermal emission ( see tab .  1 ) .",
    "the mass - loss rate of sn  2005gj is not well constrained owing to the relatively short xrt exposure time ( 5  ks ) and the large distance to the sn ( 265  mpc ) . while the above upper limits are consistent with the x - ray luminosity of , the sn is peculiar as it is the only sn ia of our sample showing excess uv emission after peak .",
    "forty - three individual exposures of  were obtained between 8 and 120 days after the explosion ( 2005 - 11 - 06@xmath15 days ) .",
    "x - ray and uv images of sn  2005ke and its host galaxy ngc  1371 are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "an excess of x - ray counts is detected from the position of sn  2005ke ( 33.6@xmath0 level of significance depending on the location of the background extraction regions ) in the merged xrt data ranging from day 154 after the outburst , with a point - spread function , sampling deadtime and vignetting - corrected net count rate of @xmath16 . adopting a thermal plasma spectrum with a temperature of @xmath17  kev ( see fransson , lundqvist & chevalier 1996 and references therein ) and assuming a galactic foreground column density with no intrinsic absorption ( @xmath18 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) we obtain a 0.32 kev x - ray band flux and luminosity of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , for a distance of 20.7  mpc ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ; koribalski et  al .",
    "the chance probability of a background agn at the measured flux being within a radius of @xmath12 of the position of sn  2005ke is estimated to be @xmath25 ( hasinger et  al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "no x - ray source is visible at the position of sn  2005ke in the  observation .",
    "the inferred @xmath26 upper limit to the x - ray count rate of @xmath27 corresponds to a flux and luminosity of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , using the same spectral template above .",
    "the   xrt x - ray luminosity inferred for sn  2005ke is lower than the lowest published upper limit of the early x - ray emission of sne ia ( e.g. , @xmath30 for sn 1992a on day 16 ; schlegel & petre 1993 ) .",
    "this improvement in the sensitivity of our measurement allows us to place significant constraints on sn ia models .",
    "the sn , however , is not detected at late times ( day 105 ) with . if the x - ray source detected with ",
    "is indeed the sn , a rate of decline of @xmath31 with index @xmath32 ( @xmath26 ) is inferred .",
    "this is consistent with the x - ray rate of decline expected from the interaction of the sn shock with a spherically symmetric csm ( @xmath4 for thermal emission ) , as well as observations of x - ray emitting core - collapse sne ( see immler & lewin 2003 and references therein ) . no other x - ray source or enhancements of the diffuse emission within the host galaxy is visible in the high - resolution ( @xmath33 fwhm )  images within the xrt counts extraction aperture ( @xmath12 radius ) , which excludes the possibility that an x - ray binary or clumps in the diffuse emission in ngc  1371 might have caused the excess emission observed with the   xrt .",
    "each of the other @xmath34 enhancements in the xrt image , however , have matching  x - rays sources .",
    "our detection implies either x - ray emission from compton - scattered @xmath35-rays of the radioactive decay products of the sn ejecta or an interaction of the sn shock with a sufficiently dense csm . for comparison of the observed x - ray luminosity ( or upper limit ) with the expected x - ray luminosity from sn ia models , we calculated the emergent hard x - ray spectrum of model w7 ( nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1994 ) using a monte carlo @xmath35-ray transport code to simulate the propagation of photons produced by the radioactive - decay of @xmath36ni and @xmath36co and experiencing compton scattering , photo - electric absorption , and pair production processes ( burrows & the 1990 ) .",
    "bremsstrahlung emission is expected to dominate the radiation in the 0.32.0  kev band ( clayton & the 1991 ) .",
    "we calculate the bremsstrahlung emergent spectrum of model w7 ( as in clayton & the 1991 ) but with much improved statistics .",
    "the bremsstrahlung component extends to @xmath37  kev at @xmath38 days and lower at later times .",
    "the total luminosities in the energy range of 0.32.0  kev are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 at @xmath42 , 38 , and 46 days . clearly , the bremsstrahlung emission from sn ia models is far below the observed luminosity from sn  2005ke .",
    "a more likely source of the x - ray emission is circumstellar interaction , probably with mass lost by the companion .",
    "the reported velocity of the siii 6,355  absorption line minimum ( @xmath43 ; patat & baade 2005 ) provides a lower limit to the shock velocity of the interaction",
    ". models of hydrodynamic interaction for a typical sn ia density structure show that the forward shock velocity may be @xmath44 ( chevalier & fransson , in preparation ) . assuming a constant mass loss rate @xmath45 and wind velocity @xmath46 from the progenitor s companion , the thermal x - ray luminosity of the forward shock region is @xmath47 ( immler , wilson & terashima 2002 ) , where @xmath48 is the mean mass per particle ( @xmath49  g for a h+he plasma ) and @xmath50 the cooling function of the heated plasma at temperature @xmath51 . because of the higher density at the reverse shock , it is likely for the reverse shock component to dominate the luminosity by a factor of @xmath52@xmath53 ( chevalier 1982 ) . adopting @xmath54 , an effective cooling function of @xmath55 for an optically thin thermal plasma with temperature of @xmath56  k for the forward shock ( fransson , lundqvist & chevalier 1996 ; raymond , cox & smith 1976 ) , and @xmath57 , a mass - loss rate of @xmath2 with an uncertainty of a factor of 23 is inferred . assuming different plasma temperatures in the range @xmath58@xmath59 k",
    "would lead to changes in the emission measure of @xmath60 .",
    "the mass - loss rate is one of the lowest reported for any sn progenitor system detected either in x - rays ( immler & lewin 2003 ) or in the radio ( weiler et  al .  2002 ) .",
    "however , panagia et al .  ( 2006 ) have recently presented upper limits on the radio emission from a number of sne ia which are interpreted as setting upper limits on @xmath45 as low as @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , soderberg ( 2006 ) reports the nondetection of sn  2005ke at 8.46 ghz , although flux limits are not given .",
    "x - ray emission from sne is usually interpreted as thermal radiation . at low circumstellar densities , nonthermal mechanisms may dominate and @xmath62 could be as low as @xmath63 for @xmath64 in sn 2005ke ( chevalier & fransson in preparation ) . however , the nondetection of radio emission could limit the applicability of these mechanisms .",
    "we rebinned 268  ks of xrt data of sn  2005ke into five consecutive time bins with similar exposure times ( 47 , 47 , 62 , 56 , and 55  ks ) to further study the temporal behavior of the x - ray emission ( see fig .  3 , left - hand panel ) .",
    "although the x - ray light curve is consistent with a constant x - ray luminosity during the period monitored , we find marginal evidence that the x - ray luminosity might have increased during the early observations .",
    "the x - ray rise could be due to decreasing absorption by material along the line of sight to the hot gas as the expanding shell becomes optically thin , although we do not expect local absorption to be important for our deduced parameters .",
    "significant excess in the uv output of sn  2005ke starts around day 35 after the explosion , especially in the @xmath9 and @xmath11 filters ( see fig .  3 , right - hand panel ) .",
    "no such excess is observed in the optical band lightcurves .",
    "possible effects of csm interaction on uv emission are inverse compton scattering of photospheric photons by hot electrons or a reduction of uv line blanketing due to heating and ionization by circumstellar radiation . the luminosity of the uv excess dropped by a factor of @xmath65 between days 45 and 105 , as estimated from comparisons with the other sn ia light curves .",
    "if the x - ray luminosity experienced a similar drop during that time period , the  upper limit may not be in conflict with the xrt detection .",
    "evidence for csm interaction has only been reported for a few sne ia ( e.g. , sne 1999ee , mazzali et  al .  2005 ; 2002ic , hamuy et  al .",

    "2006 ; and 2005gj , prieto et  al .",
    "2005 ) based on optical spectroscopy .",
    "our detection of csm interaction in x - rays is independently confirmed by the excess of uv emission after maximum .",
    "the most plausible explanation for the presence of dense csm is that a more massive companion star ( @xmath66 ) blew - off its outer layers via stellar winds or roche lobe overflow over the last few ten thousand years before the accreted mass from the companion star pushed the progenitor close to the chandrasekhar limit , resulting in a sn ia explosion .",
