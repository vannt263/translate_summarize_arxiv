    "this is comparable to the optical size of sst j1604 + 4304 which is approximately 1.2@xmath33 0.5 in the @xmath32 band .",
    "this supports the view that the galaxy is surrounded by the shell .",
    "further support is the fact that there are no significant color gradients across the galaxy in the @xmath37 images .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , starburst environments are rather inhospitable to dust ; dust grains in the starburst site can be transported to a large distance in a relatively short time by radiation pressure(@xcite ; @xcite ) , as well dust grains that formed at sn explosions are processed and evolve in sn remnants @xcite - small size grains are quickly destroyed in sn remnants by sputtering .",
    "thus , a cavity - shell structure is a natural geometry for the dust distribution in star - forming galaxies ; the starburst site is inside the cavity where dust is depleted , and the opaque dust shell is surrounding the cavity .",
    "the shell is observed as a foreground screen .",
    "such foreground screens were found in local starburst galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the foreground screen of sst j1604 + 4304 , the dust would be unevenly distributed ; we are only looking at part of the starburst site at uv and optical wavelengths through relatively transparent holes with @xmath83 = 0.8 , and the other part is completely obscured at these wavelengths .",
    "this explains that @xmath5 is two times greater than the stellar luminosity derived from the broad - band sed analysis .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that dust created in the first sn explosions can be driven through the interior of the sn remnants and accumulated in the sn shells , where second - generation stars may form in compressed cooling gases .",
    "hence , galaxies may be observed as dust - free objects at the very beginning . when much dust formed in sn ejecta , the starburst site would become completely obscured by dust at uv to near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "this stage would correspond to extremely dusty objects like dogs and smgs .",
    "then , the galactic winds would turned on .",
    "@xcite discussed that the galactic winds or superwinds frequently observed in starbursts and ulirgs will sweep out any diffuse interstellar matter from the starburst site .",
    "such galactic winds will turned on when the thermal energy of the gas heated by sn explosions exceeds the gravitationally binding energy of the gas . according to the models for chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies by @xcite , galactic winds turn on later in more massive galaxies .",
    "the onset of a galactic wind is 350 myr for a @xmath91 galaxy , and the metallicity increases up to more than the solar value .",
    "these predictions seem to agree well with the age and the metallicity observed in sst j1604 + 4304 , in which the galactic wind would just turn on and dust grains in the opaque shell are pushed and moved outward , creating partially transparent holes in the shell .",
    "this picture is consistent with the fact that dusty objects are deemed to be more abundant in massive galaxies than in less massive galaxies , although mid- and far - infrared observations are strongly biased to ir - luminous objects .",
    "this observational trend is expected , because galactic winds turn on later and thus the dust shell becomes more opaque for more massive galaxies , resulting in longer time of the dust - obscured stage .",
    "this may be the reason why dogs and smgs are so infrared - luminous and massive .      what would happen if the missing 1/2 of the bolometric luminosity comes from an agn ?",
    "in this case , the stellar mass ranging 0.1 - 8 @xmath71 is reduced to one half of that for the pure star formation .",
    "the number of sne is also reduced by the same amount , while the dust mass does not change . thus , the dust production rate is increased by a factor of 2 , i.e. , @xmath10 per sn .",
    "this is within a range consistent with the model predictions(@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the metallicity is the same as derived for pure star formation , because the sn ejecta mass is also reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "if the agn shines at the eddington rate , the mass of the agn is @xmath125 .",

    "<S> we present the detailed optical to far - infrared observations of sst j1604 + 4304 , an ulirg at @xmath0 . analyzing the stellar absorption lines , </S>",
    "<S> namely , the caii h & k and balmer h lines in the optical spectrum , we derive the upper limits of an age for the stellar population . given this constraint , </S>",
    "<S> the minimum @xmath1 method is used to fit the stellar population models to the observed sed from 0.44 to 5.8 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the following properties . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar population has an age 40 - 200 myr with a metallicity 2.5 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the starlight is reddened by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the reddening is caused by the foreground dust screen , indicating that dust is depleted in the starburst site and the starburst site is surrounded by a dust shell . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared ( 8 - 1000 ) luminosity is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is two times greater than that expected from the observed starlight , suggesting either that 1/2 of the starburst site is completely obscured at uv - optical wavelengths , or that 1/2 of @xmath5 comes from agn emission . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred dust mass is @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is sufficient to form a shell surrounding the galaxy with an optical depth @xmath3 . from our best stellar population model - an instantaneous starburst with an age 40 myr </S>",
    "<S> , we infer the rate of 19 supernovae(sne ) per year . </S>",
    "<S> simply analytical models imply that 2.5 @xmath2 in stars was reached when the gas mass reduced to 30% of the galaxy mass . </S>",
    "<S> the gas metallcity is @xmath7 at this point . </S>",
    "<S> the gas - to - dust mass ratio is then @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred dust production rate is @xmath9 per sn . </S>",
    "<S> if 1/2 of @xmath5 comes from agn emission , the rate is @xmath10 per sn . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the evolutionary link of sst j1604 + 4304 to other galaxy populations in terms of the stellar masses and the galactic winds , including optically selected low - luminosity lyman @xmath11-emitters and submillimeter selected high - luminosity galaxies .    </S>",
