    "recently the first experimental data obtained at thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( former cebaf ) on the deuteron structure function @xmath4 and tensor polarization @xmath3 , measured in the elastic @xmath5 scattering , have been reported @xcite .",
    "they are rather precise and correspond to a maximum momentum transfer of 6 ( gev / c)@xmath1 .",
    "since in the @xmath5 collision the deuteron gets from the electron a momentum comparable with the deuteron mass , these data are probing the trully relativistic dynamics inside the deuteron .",
    "our preliminary calculations of the form factors and of @xmath3 have been presented in  @xcite .",
    "we present in this paper the details of our approach , discuss the influence of the different choices of nucleon electromagnetic form factors parametrization and compare our results with the reported experimental data .    in our calculations",
    "we assume the deuteron structure to be determined by the relativistic nucleon - meson dynamics .",
    "namely , we suppose that the nucleons in the deuteron interact by exchanging relativistic mesons .",
    "we take the same set of mesons and parameter values used in the construction of the bonn potential  @xcite .",
    "however , we do not make any nonrelativistic potential approximation and calculate the one - boson - exchange kernel in relativistic form , as it appears from field theory .    in the momentum tranfer region scanned in tjnaf ,",
    "the relativistic effects related to the nucleons motion , to the spin rotations and to the retardation of the exchanged mesons , should manifest themselves in full measure and be of crucial importance in describing the data .",
    "therefore we believe that their main part can be properly taken into account even in an approximate relativistic calculation .",
    "on the other hand , it is important to work in an approach which provides a clear physical interpretation of the incorporated effects .",
    "the deuteron form factors are calculated in the framework of the explicitly covariant version of the light - front dynamics ( lfd ) recently reviewed in @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the state vector is defined on the light - front plane of general position @xmath6{$\\cdot$}}x = 0 $ ] , where @xmath7 is a four - vector such as @xmath8 .",
    "this restores the relativistic covariance lost in the standard light - front approach which is obtained as a particular case for @xmath9 .",
    "the relativistic wave functions  the fock components of the state vector  are the closest couterparts of the nonrelativistic ones .",
    "this allows one to benefit from the knowledge of the nonrelativistic wave functions and to incorporate selfconsistently the relativistic effects . using the light - front plane leads to significant simplifications due to the absence of vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the diagram technique is a three - dimensional one and can be interpreted in terms of time - ordered physical processes .",
    "therefore the selection of the diagrams contributing to the kernel or to the form factors , whose numerical estimation is rather difficult in any approach , can be supported by the intuitive understanding of the corresponding physical process .",
    "all that allows , in a given relativistic dynamics , to carry out the calculations on a satisfactory level of confidence .",
    "we mention also few other approaches to calculate the relativistic wave function and the deuteron electromagnetic form factors . in the standard version of lfd , defined on the plane @xmath10 ,",
    "these form factors were calculated in @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite are based on the bethe - salpeter approach and the works @xcite use a three - dimensional reduction of the bethe - salpeter function  the gross wave function @xcite .    in sect . [ wf ]",
    "we present the relativistic deuteron wave function on the light front . in sect .",
    "[ emv ] the electromagnetic vertex of the deuteron in the impulse approximation , based on the one - body electromagnetic nucleon current , is discussed . in sect .",
    "[ contact ] we discuss the contact ( instantaneous ) interaction , corresponding to the @xmath11 vertex ( @xmath12 is an exchanged meson ) which is a correction to the one - body current . in sect .",
    "[ ffs ] we explain how to extract the form factors , separating them from the nonphysical contributions .",
    "section [ sec_nemff ] is devoted to the evaluation of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors influence in the deuteron observables .",
    "section [ numer ] contains a comparison of our results with the experimental data and concluding remarks .",
    "the wave functions are the fock components of the state vector defined on the light - front plane @xmath6{$\\cdot$}}x = 0 $ ] .",
    "the explicit covariance allows one to construct the general form of the light - front wave function for a system with a given spin .",
    "the relativistic deuteron wave function on the light front contains six spin components , in contrast to two components  s and d - waves  in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "its general form is given in @xcite .",
    "below we will keep only three dominating components : @xmath13{$\\cdot$}}p}\\gamma_5 \\epsilon_{\\nu\\alpha\\beta\\gamma }            k_1^{\\alpha}k_2^{\\beta}\\omega^{\\gamma},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the on mass shell deuteron and the nucleon momenta , @xmath16 is the deuteron polarization vector , @xmath17 is the nucleon spinor , @xmath18 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "we notice that the wave function defined on the light - front plane depends on the orientation of this plane through the argument @xmath7 .    in the system of reference where @xmath19 the function ( [ eq1 ] ) obtains the more transparent form : @xmath20{$\\cdot$}}\\vec{\\sigma})}{\\vec{k}^2 }   -\\vec{\\sigma } ) + f_5\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\frac{i}{k}[\\vec{k}\\times \\vec{n}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the value of @xmath22 in this system of reference",
    ", @xmath23 is the direction of @xmath24 in this system , @xmath25 is the two - component nucleon spinor . the scalar functions @xmath26 depend on the scalars @xmath27 and @xmath28{$\\cdot$}}\\vec{k}/k$ ] .",
    "one can find a special representation @xcite in which the wave function ( [ eq1 ] ) obtains the form ( [ eq2 ] ) in arbitrary system of reference .",
    "the components @xmath29 in ( [ eq1 ] ) and @xmath30 in ( [ eq2 ] ) are linearly related with each other @xcite .",
    "the wave function ( [ eq1 ] ) was calculated in @xcite in a perturbative way incorporating the full relativistic one - boson exchange ( obe ) kernel found in lfd , with the corresponding nonrelativistic wave function as zero order approximation .",
    "this calculation can be considered as the perturbation theory developed in terms of the difference between the relativistic kernel and the nonrelativistic potential . for the obe kernel",
    "the set of mesons , coupling constants and form factors corresponding to the bonn model @xcite were used .",
    "the solution thus obtained is approximate in two ways : first for its perturbative character does not provide an exact solution of the lfd equation and second because the parameters of the obe kernel were kept to their original values i.e. were not fitted in the lfd relativistic framework .",
    "the accuracy of our solution in reproducing the low energy deuteron observables was estimated at the level of 20% in norm .",
    "in nonrelativistic region of @xmath31 , components @xmath32 and @xmath33 found this way turn into the usual s- and d - waves , whereas other components become negligible .",
    "however , starting from @xmath34 gev / c , component @xmath35 dominates over all other components , including @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the physical meaning of this dominating extra component has been clarified @xcite by comparing , in @xmath36 approximation , the analytical expression for the amplitude of the deuteron electrodisintegration near threshold with the nonrelativistic one , including meson exchange currents . for the isovector transition , in the region where the so called pair term with the pion exchange dominates ,",
    "this component ( together with a similar component in the scattering state ) automatically incorporates 50% of the pair term contribution and therefore dominates too .",
    "another 50% is given by the contact interaction ( see below ) .",
    "the electromagnetic vertex @xmath37 we use to calculate the deuteron form factors corresponds to the sum of the impulse approximation ( ia ) ( figure [ f1_ks92_b ] ) and of the contact interaction ( c ) ( figure [ ct4 ] ) which takes partially into account the two - body current : @xmath38 these contributions",
    "are explained in what follows .",
    "the deuteron ia electromagnetic vertex is shown in figure [ f1_ks92_b ] .",
    "the dashed line is associated with a fictitious particle  the so called spurion .",
    "it reflects the fact that , although all the momenta are on the corresponding mass shells , the wave function is off energy shell , and therefore there is no any conservation law between all the components of the nucleon and the deuteron four - momenta .",
    "the spurion momentum just absorbs their nonzero difference and one has @xmath39 . to avoid misunderstanding ,",
    "we emphasize that the spurion line does not imply the presence of an extra particle in the intermediate state in figure [ f1_ks92_b ] which contains two nucleons only .",
    "the electromagnetic amplitude in the impulse approximation is derived by applying the rules of the graph techniques @xcite to figure [ f1_ks92_b ] .",
    "it has the form : @xmath40                                \\ ; \\frac{d^3k_1}{(1-x)^2 2\\varepsilon_{k_1}},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41{$\\cdot$}}k_1/\\omega{\\makebox[0.08cm]{$\\cdot$}}p$ ] .",
    "the wave function @xmath42 given by eq.([eq1 ] ) corresponds to the deuteron initial state , while @xmath43 corresponds to its final state .",
    "@xmath44 is the electromagnetic vertex of the nucleon :    @xmath45    @xmath46 and @xmath47 being the nucleon elecromagnetic form factors .",
    "the expression for the trace in ( [ eq4 ] ) is obtained as follows .",
    "to each nucleon line in figure  [ f1_ks92_b ] we associate the lfd nucleon propagator , with the @xmath48 vertex we associate expression ( [ eq5 ] ) , and with @xmath49 vertices the deuteron wave functions .",
    "we get in this way the following product of spin matrices :    @xmath50^{\\dagger } ( \\hat{k}'_2+m ) \\gamma^{\\rho}(\\hat{k}_2+m)\\phi_{\\nu}u_c\\right\\}_{\\beta\\alpha }   e^{\\nu}_{\\lambda}(p ) ( \\hat{k}_1+m)_{\\beta\\alpha}.\\ ] ]    factor @xmath51 in ( [ ffe1 ] ) corresponds to the upper line of the diagram and the factor @xmath52 corresponds to the lower line .",
    "we attach the deuteron wave function to the upper one .",
    "we keep in ( [ ffe1 ] ) the matrix indices @xmath53 and @xmath54 explicitly .",
    "since both nucleon lines are passed in the same direction , the order of indices @xmath55 is the same .",
    "this means that one of the factors in ( [ ffe1 ] ) ( we take the second one ) is a transposed matrix .",
    "the factor @xmath56^{\\dagger}$ ] originates from the conjugated final deuteron wave function : @xmath57^{\\dagger}u(k'_2 ) =   - u(k_1 ) \\bar{\\phi}'_{\\mu }   u(k'_2),\\ ] ] where @xmath58 . with the wave function ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "we get : @xmath59^{\\dagger}=-u_c\\phi'_{\\mu}\\ ] ] and , hence , obtain the factor : @xmath60 that gives the trace in eq.([eq4 ] )",
    ". a more detailed derivation of ( [ eq4 ] ) by means of the lfd graph technique can be found in @xcite .",
    "next section is devoted to the derivation of the contact contributions .",
    "a peculiarity of the lfd is the existence , in addition to the impulse approximation , of the so called instantaneous ( or contact ) interaction in the @xmath11 vertex , where @xmath12 is any of the mesons @xmath61 , building the nn potential .",
    "its contribution to the electromagnetic vertex in @xmath62 order is shown in figure [ ct4 ] .",
    "the cross on a fermion line means that this line is not to be associated with a propagator , but with a factor proportional to @xmath63 . in the standard approach",
    "this is the well known instantaneous interaction vertex @xmath64 .",
    "the nucleon electromagnetic vertex @xmath44 is determined , as usual , by the two nucleon electromagnetic form factors given in eq.([eq5 ] ) .    in evaluating the contact amplitude , we have taken into account the sum over all six mesons contributing to the bonn potential , with the parameters used in the bonn model @xcite .",
    "this amplitude incorporates partially the two - body currents . in principle",
    "more complicated diagrams , of order higher than @xmath62 , may also contribute . since our wave function takes into account corrections associated with the first degree of @xmath62 , we keep the same order for the electromagnetic vertex .",
    "this means that we consider only the diagrams of figure [ ct4 ] and in calculating these diagrams we omit component @xmath35 in the wave function , since its contribution multiplied by the contact interaction is of higher order than @xmath62 . to calculate the effects beyond the @xmath62 order ,",
    "one has also to take into account the higher order irreducible contributions to the obe kernel .",
    "one can expect that these contributions are incorporated in this kernel on a phenomenological level by an appropriate fit of its parameters ( coupling constants , meson masses and cutoff parameters ) . however , this is not the case for the electromagnetic vertex .",
    "the contact amplitude is given by the sum of two terms which differ by the relative time order of the contact and the electromagnetic vertices : @xmath65    the @xmath66 term corresponds to the sum of diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) in figure [ ct4 ] , which differ from each other by the relative time order of the meson vertices .",
    "both of them have the contact vertex on the left hand side of the electromagnetic one .",
    "the opposite order is assumed in @xmath67 which corresponds to diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) in figure [ ct4 ] .",

    "for example , @xmath111 is obtained by the following substitution in eq.([c2 ] ) ( and similarly for @xmath112 ) :    @xmath113    @xmath114    the vertex @xmath96 is given by ( [ c8 ] ) with a minus sign ; this sign is compensated by the minus from @xmath110 , what gives the substitution ( [ c8 ] ) . in eqs.([c7],[c8 ] ) we introduce the function , which takes into account the condition ( [ c6a ] ) :    @xmath115    since the vertex @xmath96 appears multiplied on the left by @xmath116 and on the right by @xmath117 , it can be transformed into : @xmath118    the second item @xmath119 in ( [ c6b ] ) arises from the contraction of the vertices with the factor @xmath120 in ( [ c6 ] ) .",
    "it is given by ( [ c2 ] ) with the following vertices @xmath121    the other terms , like the term proportional to @xmath122 , do not contribute to the upper vertex , since being multiplied by @xmath122 from the contact term it gives zero .",
    "the difference @xmath123 in the lower vertex appears in the expression @xmath124 and , hence , does not contribute as well .",
    "the minus sign from @xmath125 is incorporated in the function ( [ cp ] ) .",
    "the next step consists in extracting the deuteron form factors from the electromagnetic vertex @xmath37 .",
    "as already mentioned , in contrast to the wave function which is always off energy shell , the on - shell amplitudes should not depend on the light - front plane orientation . however , in practice , due to the incompatibility of the transformation properties of the approximate current and wave function , the nonphysical @xmath7 dependence survives in the on - energy shell deuteron electromagnetic vertex .",

    "we emphasize that the physical @xmath7-dependent extra components in the wave function ( [ eq2 ] ) and the nonphysical @xmath7-depending structures in ( [ eq6 ] ) are present not because of the covariant formulation of the lfd .",
    "their counterparts appear in the non - covariant light - front approach too but the covariant approach allows to indicate them explicitly .    the explicit formulas to extract the physical form factors @xmath134 from the electromagnetic vertex and to separate them from nonphysical contributions @xmath132 were derived in refs .",

    "the expression for @xmath139 is proportional to the same contraction .",
    "however the expression for @xmath140 contains not only the contraction with @xmath137 but also others terms .",
    "hence , the @xmath141 component is not enough to find @xmath140 .",
    "one can easily check , using @xmath6{$\\cdot$}}q=0 $ ] , that one has for the nucleon electromagnetic vertex ( [ eq5 ] ) @xmath142 . here",
    "@xmath122 appears from the contact interaction , the contraction @xmath143 is the result of eq.([eq7 ] ) .",

    "they contribute only to @xmath140 .",
    "the form factors found this way are still not exact , but they are separated from the non - physical ones @xmath132 . as shown in @xcite and in @xcite , this separation is important , since the admixture of @xmath145 can considerably change the results .    after calculating traces and contracting tensors in eq.([eq7 ] ) for @xmath135 ( and similar expressions @xcite for @xmath139 and for @xmath140 )",

    "the integrands also contain the scalar products with @xmath7 but after integration this dependence disappears .    by this way , substituting @xmath37 in eq.([eq7 ] ) ( and in similar expressions @xcite for @xmath151 ) , we find the analytical expressions of the form factors integrands",
    ". then we carry out the numerical integration which , for the contact terms ( two - loop ) , is 6-dimensional .",
    "together with the deuteron wave function , an essential ingredient in these calculations are the nucleon electromagnetic form factors ( nemff ) .",
    "the results presented in @xcite were obtained with the dipole parametrization taken from bilenkaya et al .",
    "@xcite denoted hereafter by bkl .",
    "we analyse in what follows the influence of different nemff parametrizations in calculating the deuteron structure function within the same theoretical scheme .",
    "the parametrizations we consider , used in similar calculations found in the literature @xcite , are those given by galster et al .",
    "@xcite , hohler et al .",
    "@xcite , a combination of simon et al . for proton and platchkov et al . for neutron ( sp )",
    "@xcite and the more recent publication of mergell et al .",
    "( mmd ) @xcite .",
    "the comparison @xcite of the proton ( @xmath152 ) and neutron ( @xmath153 ) charge and magnetic form factors with the existing experimental data @xcite is shown in figure [ exp_nemff1 ] .",
    "the values of the neutron charge form factor have been squared to account for the results reported in @xcite . a first sight",
    "to this figure shows that some of these form factors have been apparently determined in the low momentum region and can not be used above 1 - 2 ( gev / c)@xmath1 .",
    "the more adequated parametrization covering the whole momentum region seems to be mmd @xcite , which will be adopted in our calculations .",
    "it provides an acceptable description for all the form factors although some variations can not be excluded due to the inaccuracy of the existing measurements , especially for the neutron form factor ( see below ) .",
    "any comparison between the theoretical and experimental results has to be understood in the context of this uncertainty that we would like to estimate .",
    "the influence of different nemff parametrizations on the deuteron structure function @xmath2 is shown in figure [ a_emff ] .",
    "the results in figure [ a_emff](a ) are fully non relativistic whereas those in [ a_emff](b ) correspond to lfd impulse approximation .",
    "the choice of the nemff has small influence at low momentum transfer .",
    "for instance at @xmath154 ( gev / c)@xmath1 , the deviation in the nonrelativistic structure function @xmath4 is @xmath155 .",
    "this deviation increases with @xmath156 and reaches already a factor two at @xmath157 ( gev / c)@xmath1 between bkl and sp parametrizations .",
    "the difference becomes dramatic for the last measured values @xmath158 ( gev / c)@xmath1 where there is one order of magnitude in the structure functions @xmath2 calculated using bkl or hohler parametrizations .",
    "it is worth noticing however that the galster and mmd sets lead to close results in all the momentum range .",
    "their difference in the lfd - ia relativistic calculation of @xmath4 remains at the level of 10 % for @xmath159 ( gev / c)@xmath1 .",
    "similar deviations have been found in the structure function @xmath12 .    as one can see from figure [ exp_nemff1 ] , the neutron electric form factor @xmath160 contains the greatest uncertainty . to estimate the influence of this uncertainty , we have considered for @xmath161 ( gev / c)@xmath1 the maximal @xmath162 values compatible with the error bars , which are a priori not excluded by the experimental data although they considerably differ from all fits .",
    "the values of @xmath2 obtained with such a modification exceed by 20 - 30% those obtained with the original mmd parametrization . from these considerations",
    "it follows that _ i _ ) the comparison between different calculations is only meaningful when the same parametrization of nemff is used and _ ii _ ) the comparison between a theoretical prediction and the measured deuteron form factors is limited by the considerable uncertainties implied by the poor knowledge of the nemff for @xmath163 ( gev / c)@xmath1 .",
    "we present in this section the comparison of the deuteron structure functions and tensor polarization observable with the last measured values . in terms of the deuteron form",
    "factors these observables read @xmath164 @xmath165 , \\ ] ] where @xmath166\\ , \\\\                                                                                                                        f_{m } & = & { \\cal g}_1\\ , \\\\                                                                                    f_q    & = & -{\\cal f}_1 - { \\cal g}_1 + { \\cal f}_2(1 + \\eta)\\ ,                       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath167 . in comparing our calculations with the data we should first emphasize that , though the theoretical framework we use  the light - front dynamics  is fully selfconsistent , the validity of our perturbative method to evaluate the wave function is restricted to relative nucleon momenta @xmath31 smaller than the nucleon mass @xmath168 . since in a form factor calculation the momentum transfer is distributed between two deuteron vertices , the initial and final ones , this value of @xmath31 corresponds approximately to the momentum transfer @xmath169 ( gev / c)@xmath1 . in absence of subtle cancellations increasing the uncertainty in the theoretical predictions",
    ", we can expect a reasonable description of the experimental data in this momentum region .    in figure [ a1 ]",
    "the structure function @xmath2 is shown together with the experimental points recently obtained at tjnaf ( hall c in filled circles @xcite and hall a in opaque triangles up @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the non - relativistic impulse approximation with the s- and d - waves of the bonn - qa wave function @xcite .",
    "the dot - dashed line is also calculated in the impulse approximation but using the light - front formalism with relativistic deuteron components @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the @xmath35 component in first degree only .",
    "the solid line incorporates , in addition , the contact terms which turn to have small influence in this observable .",
    "we can see a good agreement until @xmath170 ( gev / c)@xmath1 , a momentum region where the departure from a non relativistic description reaches one order of magnitude .",
    "it is worth noticing that this agreement is found with the lfd wave function alone , i.e. without explicitly including any mec diagrams .",
    "however , as it has been already mentioned , the extra component @xmath35 accounts for the so called pair terms in the deuteron electrodisintegration amplitude @xcite .",
    "we remark that a systematic deviation seems to manifest above 3 ( gev / c)@xmath1 .",
    "this excess is smoothly increasing with increase of @xmath156 .",
    "however , this is the region where the perturbative calculation is hardly reliable , since the deuteron wave function appears in @xmath2 in the fourth degree and a 50% correction may change the value by a factor 5 .",
    "besides , as it has been shown above , at @xmath171 ( gev / c)@xmath1 the uncertainty coming from the nemff is also high .",
    "the same agreement is seen in the deuteron polarization observable @xmath3 displayed in figure [ exp_t20 ] using the same drawing conventions . again a sizeable effect of the relativistic corrections is properly taken into account in our calculations although the actual error bars are quite comfortable .",
    "the calculated structure function @xmath172 is shown in figure [ b1 ] , using the same drawing conventions , together with the experimental data from @xcite . comparing the @xmath172 results with those of @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ", one can see a considerable deviation of our @xmath12 calculation from the data , especially in the region of the minimum , as well as highest sensitivity to the different approximations .",
    "this minimum corresponds to the zero of the deuteron magnetic form factor @xmath173 , and a small shift on this value drastically changes the value of @xmath172 in its neighborhood .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the zero of @xmath173 which exists in a nonrelativistic calculation , _ disappears _ for the relativistic @xmath174 and _ appears again _ when @xmath35 is taken into account @xcite .",
    "in a relativistic framework this minimum is thus a consequence of a delicate cancellation between the @xmath35 contribution with the contributions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "none of these @xmath175 components has been calculated with enough accuracy in our perturbative approach .",
    "therefore we can not pretend to a detailed description of @xmath172 in this region .",
    "the situation is different for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ contrib ] shows the relative contributions of the three deuteron form factors to these observables according to equations ( [ sfa ] ) and ( [ t20 ] ) .",
    "one can see that their values are dominated by the charge and quadrupole form factors @xmath176 and @xmath177 , whereas the contribution of @xmath173 , containing the highest uncertainty , is suppressed .    taking into account the same order of accuracy , i.e. , @xmath62 , which was kept in the calculation of the wave function , we get a good description of the data on @xmath3 as well as of @xmath2 in the same region of the momentum transfer , up to 2 ( gev / c)@xmath1 .",
    "the relativistic effects in @xmath174 and the contribution of @xmath35 are important to achieve this good description .",
    "the contribution of the contact term to @xmath2 and @xmath3 is small , since , as noted above , it contributes to @xmath173 only , whereas for @xmath12 it is small in the momentum transfer region shown in figure [ b1 ] but increases at higher momenta ( e.g. by a factor 2 at @xmath158 ( gev / c)@xmath1 ) .",
    "these results show that the relativistic effects in the deuteron wave function , including the extra component @xmath35 , and in the deuteron electromagnetic vertex make considerable influence on the deuteron form factors . note that the effect of incorporating @xmath35 on @xmath3 is qualitatively similar to that obtained when adding the contribution of the pair current in non - relativistic calculations @xcite .",
    "we should finally emphasize that the results presented in this section have been obtained without fitting any new set of parameters , neither in the nucleon - meson form factors nor in the nn interaction kernel , which was taken as it is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the agreement of our calculations with the experimental data , as well as with some other calculations carried out in the framework of meson - nucleon dynamics ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) , shows that the deuteron structure at small distances is understood rather well within this theoretical framework .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that probing distances of the order of @xmath178 fm , at which quarks effects should manifest themselves in their full glory , could be accounted by the relativistic nucleon - meson dynamics and the phenomenological nucleon form factors .",
    "the parameters of the effective nucleon - meson lagrangian , fixed by fitting the @xmath109 experimental data , should be in principle derived from qcd , what is a separate problem .",
    "this allows us to make the following general conclusion : _ at least in what concerns the deuteron , the relativistic nuclear dynamics can be developed independently of its derivation from qcd_.    our calculations can be improved in many respects .",
    "an exact solution of the equation for the deuteron is necessary and is in progress .",
    "besides the non - perturbative calculation , it implies the determination of the @xmath109 kernel parameters in the framework of the light - front equations .",
    "this requires also a careful treatment of higher order contributions to the kernel .",
    "finally , the calculation of electromagnetic observables should include higher fock states ( @xmath179 , etc . ) and the meson exchange currents which are not included in the wave function components , like those corresponding to the interaction of the photon with the intermediate mesons ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "the improvement of the experimental data on the nucleon em form factors is also an urgent task .",
    "the authors are sincerely grateful to j.s .",
