    "the indication for an anomalous muon and electron flavor composition of the observed atmospheric neutrino flux represents a still unsolved puzzle ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "a possible explanation could be provided by neutrino flavor oscillations . in this paper",
    "we adopt such a viewpoint and explore systematically its consequences in a three - flavor framework with one dominant neutrino square mass difference .",
    "we perform a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the experimental information coming from the kamiokande @xcite , imb @xcite , frejus @xcite , and nusex @xcite atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "we do not characterize the atmospheric neutrino anomaly with the popular double flavor ratio @xmath8 which , as discussed in @xcite , is affected by non - gaussian uncertainties .",
    "instead we separate the @xmath0-like and @xmath1-like event rates , whose errors are normally distributed @xcite .",
    "we compare the data with the theoretical expectations in the presence of two - flavor and three - flavor oscillations , including the earth matter effects @xcite .",
    "we place significant bounds in the oscillation parameter space , which can provide useful guidelines for model building , for the expectations at the running superkamiokande experiment @xcite , and for the discovery potential at future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "we also highlight the interplay between the results of this work and those obtained  within the same theoretical framework  from the analysis of flavor oscillation searches in accelerator and reactor @xcite or solar @xcite neutrino experiments .",
    "we include a larger data set and use a more refined statistical approach than previous three - flavor analyses of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly performed by other authors @xcite and by ourselves @xcite .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the experimental ingredients of the analysis and describe their treatment . in sec .",
    "iii we briefly recall the properties of three - flavor oscillations in the hypothesis of one dominant square mass difference . in sec .",
    "iv we perform the data analysis in the subcases of two - flavor @xmath2 and @xmath3 oscillations . in sec .",
    "v we present the main results of our analysis of three - flavor atmospheric neutrino oscillations and discuss their relation with the indications coming from other ( laboratory and solar ) neutrino oscillation experiments . in sec .",
    "vi we summarize our work and draw our conclusions . in appendices a , b , and c , we discuss respectively our treatment of the kamiokande multi - gev neutrino data , the correlation of the theoretical uncertainties , and the symmetry properties of the neutrino oscillation probability .",
    "in this section we introduce the experimental data and discuss briefly some technical aspects of their analysis .",
    "we analyze the largest set of data on the electron and muon composition of the atmospheric neutrino flux , which can be considered both homogeneous and statistically consistent .",
    "in particular , we include the neutrino - induced @xmath1-like and @xmath0-like event rates measured by the four experiments kamiokande @xcite , imb @xcite , frjus @xcite , and nusex @xcite at low energies ( so - called sub - gev data ) , and by the kamiokande experiment at higher energies in five zenith - angle sectors @xcite ( so - called multi - gev data ) . concerning the multi - gev data",
    ", we will consider either the information coming from the binned angular distribution of events ( `` binned multi - gev '' ) , or the reduced information coming from the angle - integrated number of events ( `` unbinned multi - gev '' ) .",
    "as it is well known , the frjus and nusex measurements do not confirm the kamiokande and imb observation of an anomalous muon - electron flavor composition of the atmospheric events @xcite .",
    "however , all the data are statistically compatible within @xmath9 or better ( see fig .  3 in @xcite ) and their combination in a global analysis is reasonable",
    ".    we do not include the higher - energy data pertaining only to the muon flavor content , the so - called upward - going muons ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this data set has specific experimental characteristics and deserves a separate theoretical analysis ( in progress ) .",
    "however , we will briefly comment on upward - going muons in due course .- like and @xmath0-like events . ]",
    "we also do not include the data from the soudan  2 experiment @xcite , because a detailed , official analysis has not been published yet by the experimental collaboration .",
    "we emphasize that , according to the discussion in @xcite , we prefer to separate the electron and muon flavor information , instead of using the popular ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the ratio @xmath10 allows a large cancellation of the theoretical errors @xcite , but its probability distribution is highly non - gaussian . we have shown @xcite that one can use only normally distributed variables provided that , when the @xmath0 and @xmath1 experimental and theoretical rates are separated , the correlations of their uncertainties are included .    in the comparison of the data with theoretical predictions , we use a @xmath11 statistic including both experimental and theoretical uncertainties , with the proper error correlation matrix @xcite .      in order to get significant constraints on the neutrino oscillation hypothesis ,",
    "the measured numbers of @xmath0-like and @xmath1-like events produced by neutrinos and antineutrinos in each detector must be compared with detailed theoretical predictions .",
    "the theoretical calculations involve the numerical estimate of integrals of the kind : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the zenith angle , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are flavor indices , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the ( anti)neutrino and lepton energies , @xmath18 is the atmospheric ( anti)neutrino flux , @xmath19 is the oscillation probability , @xmath20 is the ( anti)neutrino interaction cross - section , and @xmath21 is the lepton detection efficiency . our estimate of the @xmath22 s in the multi - gev energy range is discussed in appendix a.    concerning the sub - gev experiments , the ingredients @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 that we use to compute the @xmath22 s have been reported in our previous works @xcite . in particular , we use the bartol group calculations of @xmath18 @xcite for the electron and muon neutrino and antineutrino fluxes at each detector location .    the bartol fluxes @xcite",
    "have been used by all the four sub - gev experiments in at least one simulation , and thus provide us with the advantages of a uniform data analysis and of a homogeneous comparison of our calculations with the published detector simulations .",
    "this comparison has been done in @xcite . in particular , we refer the reader to fig .",
    "1 in @xcite , where our absolute predictions for the lepton energy spectra are superposed to the corresponding published monte  carlo simulations of the kamiokande , imb , frjus , and nusex experiments ( in absence of oscillations ) .",
    "the agreement of our calculations with the published spectra is good .",
    "since this work was initiated , new refined atmospheric neutrino flux calculations have appeared @xcite .",
    "these new fluxes , as far as we know from the published literature , have not been used yet by the experimental collaborations to reprocess their simulations or to reanalyze their data , and are not used in this work either . however , in the statistical analysis we conservatively associate a @xmath23 uncertainty @xmath24 with the absolute theoretical neutrino fluxes .",
    "this error accounts conservatively for the spread in the atmospheric neutrino calculations published so far @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 neutrino fluxes are highly correlated ( see @xcite and appendix  b for more details ) .",
    "such correlation is even more important than the absolute magnitude of the errors themselves in driving the fits to atmospheric @xmath7 data .",
    "in fact , it will be shown that a reduction of the flux error from our default value , @xmath25 , to @xmath26 or even @xmath27 does not change significantly the results of the oscillation fits . in the absence of oscillations , it has already been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ( table  iii ) that the statistical significance of the anomaly does not change much by reducing the flux error from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "the last ingredient of eq .",
    "( [ eq : iab ] ) to be discussed is the oscillation probability @xmath30 .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .",
    "the calculation of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation probabilities requires a well - defined theoretical framework . the three - flavor framework used in this paper",
    "is completely specified by the neutrino spectrum shown in fig",
    ".  1 .    in fig .  1 we show the adopted spectrum of neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath31 .",
    "two states @xmath32 are assumed to be almost degenerate in mass .",
    "the third state , @xmath33 , is largely separated in mass from the almost degenerate doublet , with @xmath34 being the dominant square mass difference driving the atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "this situation can be realized either in scenario ( a ) or in scenario ( b ) of fig .  1",
    ", that is , with @xmath33 either lighter or heavier than @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    in both scenarios of fig .  1 ,",
    "the subdominant square mass difference between @xmath36 and @xmath35 , @xmath37 , is assumed to be too small to produce detectable effects in the energy range explored by current atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "this assumption holds , for instance , if the parameter @xmath38 is used to fit solar neutrino data @xcite ( @xmath39 ev@xmath40 at the best - fit point for matter - enhanced oscillations ) . at the scale of the atmospheric neutrino experiments",
    ", we simply set @xmath41 .",
    "the limits of this approximations are commented in sec .  v  c. the same approximation has been used in @xcite where we studied accelerator and reactor neutrino oscillations , and to which we refer the reader for further details and references .",
    "we collectively consider the accelerator , reactor , and atmospheric neutrino experiments as `` terrestrial '' oscillation experiments .    at zeroth order in @xmath42 the two scenarios of fig .",
    "1 are physically different for atmospheric neutrinos propagating in the earth matter ( see appendix c ) , while they are not distinguishable either by means of accelerator and reactor neutrino oscillation searches ( in vacuum ) @xcite or by solar neutrino oscillations ( in vacuum or in matter ) @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "atmospheric neutrinos potentially provide a unique information on the neutrino spectrum .",
    "notice that the spectra ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "1 are simply related by : @xmath43 in the following , we will explicitly distinguish cases ( a ) and ( b ) whenever necessary .    in the framework characterized by the spectrum of fig .",
    "1 one has two important simplifications with respect to the most general three - flavor oscillation scenario ( see @xcite and appendix c ) : ( 1 ) neutrino mixing in terrestrial oscillation experiments can be described by just two mixing angles , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; and ( 2 ) effects related to the a possible cp violating phase are unobservable .",
    "it follows that the parameter space for terrestrial ( including atmospheric ) three - flavor neutrino oscillations can be described in terms of three parameters : @xmath6 .    the angles @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined as in @xcite .",
    "in the standard parametrization of the mixing matrix @xcite the following identifications hold : @xmath46    the three - flavor framework with one dominant square mass difference is the simplest extension of the two - generation formalism in which all the two - flavor oscillation channels are open .",
    "the subcases of pure two - flavor oscillations @xmath47 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 , are recovered in the limits @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 respectively . a clear graphical representation of the general three - flavor case and of its two - flavor limits is provided by fig .  2 in @xcite .",
    "here we do not pay attention to the @xmath47 subcase , since it does not solve  but rather aggravates  the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "we will briefly comment on a theoretically interesting , genuine three - flavor subcase of this framework , the so - called threefold maximal mixing scenario @xcite , in sec .",
    "v. in our notation , threefold maximal mixing corresponds to @xmath51 at any @xmath4 .    with a neutrino mass spectrum as in fig .  1 , the calculation of the vacuum oscillation probability for neutrinos arriving from above the horizon is straightforward ( see appendix  c ) .",
    "however , the vacuum approximation is not adequate for neutrinos which travel in the earth matter for a large fraction of their path length . for these neutrinos",
    "one expects substantial deviations from the vacuum oscillation probability @xcite when @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the typical electron density along the neutrino trajectory .",
    "this implies significant matter effects in the range @xmath54@xmath55 ev@xmath40 for sub - gev observables and in the range @xmath56@xmath57 ev@xmath40 for multi - gev observables .",
    ", see appendix c. ] moreover , a genuine three - flavor effect takes place @xcite : the effective mass eigenstates @xmath58 in matter are not exactly degenerate , and the phase variation associated to their splitting is relevant for path lengths comparable to the earth radius .",
    "this additional phase disappears in the two - flavor subcases , since one of the `` degenerate '' neutrinos decouples .",
    "we take into account the earth matter effects by solving numerically the neutrino propagation equations with an assigned earth density profile @xcite . in order to save computer time ,",
    "the density profile is modeled as a 5-step function @xcite with steps corresponding to the five relevant radial shells .",
    "this approximation is sufficiently accurate for our purposes .",
    "we have a final remark on the graphical representations of the results . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that the three - flavor parameter space for terrestrial neutrino oscillations can be usefully charted using the ( logarithmic ) coordinates @xmath59 . in the following",
    ", the results of our analysis will be displayed in several plane sections of the space @xmath59 at fixed values of either @xmath4 , @xmath45 , or @xmath44 .",
    "in this section we show the results of our analysis in the subcases of pure @xmath2 and @xmath3 two - flavor oscillations .",
    "the discussion of these cases is interesting in itself , and helps in understanding the more complicated situation of three - flavor oscillations .      in our framework",
    "we recall that the subcase of pure @xmath2 oscillations is reached in the limit @xmath60 , which leaves @xmath61 as relevant variables .",
    "this subcase is particularly simple from a theoretical viewpoint , since @xmath62 is decoupled and thus the earth matter does not affect the oscillations . as a consequence ( see appendix  c ) , the scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .  1 become physically equivalent , and the formalism is invariant under the substitution @xmath63 .",
    "one usually takes advantage of this symmetry to restrict the range of the mixing angle @xmath44 to @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "here we show the full range @xmath65 $ ] in order to mark the difference with the @xmath3 case ( sec .  iv  b ) , where the symmetry @xmath63 is broken by matter effects .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the results of our analysis as bounds in the @xmath66 plane at @xmath67 c.l .",
    "( solid lines ) and @xmath68 c.l .",
    "( dotted lines ) , which corresponds to @xmath69 and 9.21 respectively ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "notice the mirror symmetry of all the curves with respect to the axis @xmath71 .    to avoid ambiguities , the allowed regions are marked by stars .",
    "we refrain from showing the best - fit points in each panel of fig .  2 , since the @xmath11 is often relatively flat around the minimum ( except for the combination of several data ) , and the best - fit point is not particularly informative .",
    "we give the best - fit coordinates only for the combination of all data .    in the first four panels of fig .  2 ( left to right , top to bottom ) we display the parameter regions individually allowed by the four sub - gev experiments , frjus , nusex , imb , and kamiokande .",
    "the frjus and nusex experiments are consistent with no oscillations , and thus strongly disfavor the situation of maximal mixing @xmath72 , at least for not too small @xmath4 where they are not sensitive to oscillations .",
    "the imb and kamiokande experiments are instead compatible with large mixing in a wide range of @xmath4 ( @xmath73 ev@xmath40 ) , although the best fit is not reached exactly for maximal mixing .    it should be noted that the sub - gev experiments have still some sensitivity to values of @xmath4 as small as @xmath74 ev@xmath40 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the neutrino phase variation due to oscillations can be of @xmath75 for @xmath76 gev , @xmath77 ev@xmath40 , and a path length equal to the earth diameter .",
    "this fact , combined with our conservative error estimates , explains the extension of the imb and kamiokande allowed regions down to values as small as @xmath78 ev@xmath40 in fig .  2 .",
    "our kamiokande allowed regions are larger than those derived by the kamiokande collaboration analysis @xcite .",
    "however , one has to consider that we use only the published experimental information , while the kamiokande collaboration uses energy - angle lepton distributions that are not published , and also adopts a rather different approach in the statistical analysis of the data @xcite .    the 5th and 6th panels in fig .",
    "2 show the constraints from the multi - gev kamiokande data , taken both unbinned and binned respectively .",
    "the sensitivity to small @xmath4 is lower than in the sub - gev cases , since the average neutrino energy is higher . in the binned case ( full information from the angular distribution ) , @xmath4 is bounded from above at @xmath67 c.l .",
    "in fact , the measured angular distribution is inconsistent with the flat oscillation probability corresponding to averaged fast oscillations ( @xmath79 ) @xcite .    in the 7th and 8th panels of fig .  2 , we combine the sub - gev and multi - gev ( unbinned and binned ) kamiokande data . in the 9th panel",
    "all sub - gev data are combined together .",
    "notice that maximal mixing @xmath72 is strongly disfavored for @xmath80 ev@xmath40 , due to the inclusion of the frjus and nusex data in the fit . in the 10th panel",
    "we combine the sub - gev data with the multi - gev unbinned data .",
    "the multi - gev unbinned data disfavor the lowest values of @xmath4 that would be allowed by the sub - gev data alone .    in the 11th panel",
    "we combine sub - gev and binned multi - gev data .",
    "therefore , this panel contains the maximum information from the atmospheric neutrino experiments ( 8 sub - gev + 10 multi - gev observables ) .",
    "the best - fit is reached at @xmath81 and at the symmetric point @xmath82 .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath4 is somewhat lower than the popular value @xmath57 ev@xmath40 , since we include the frjus and nusex data .",
    "these data are compatible with @xmath83 ( no oscillation ) and thus tend to drag the @xmath4-fit to lower values than those favored by imb and kamiokande alone .",
    "the value of the absolute @xmath11 at the minimum is 19.7 , which represents a good fit to the 18 atmospheric observables ( with the freedom to vary only @xmath61 ) .",
    "one should compare this value with the corresponding ( worse ) fit in the no - oscillation hypothesis , @xmath84 .",
    "the last panel in fig .  2 shows the region allowed by the combination of all the established accelerator oscillation searches .",
    "the region allowed at @xmath67 by all atmospheric neutrino data is also allowed by present accelerator data ( reactor data place no bounds in the @xmath3 oscillation limit ) .",
    "the atmospheric bounds are in conflict with the accelerator bounds only at @xmath85 c.l .   and high @xmath4 .    in fig",
    "the magnitude of the theoretical neutrino flux error , @xmath86 , has been taken equal to @xmath28 ( default value ) .",
    "this choice is not decisive in the fit , as shown in fig .",
    "3 .    in fig .",
    "3 we compare two representative fits ( all sub - gev data , and all sub - gev  +  multi - gev data ) using both @xmath25 ( solid contours ) and @xmath87 ( dotted contours ) .",
    "the differences between the two cases are very small .",
    "in fact , since we include the proper correlations between the neutrino fluxes , the @xmath62 and @xmath88 flux errors nearly `` cancel '' in the analysis , with a residual @xmath89 difference allowed in the relative @xmath90 flux normalization .",
    "of course , a similar cancellation is reached by using the ratio @xmath8 , but with the serious disadvantage of obtaining a highly non - gaussian distribution for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "previous analyses of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly that applied gaussian statistics to @xmath10 , including our works @xcite and @xcite , may thus have overestimated the statistical significance of the anomaly , and underestimated the mass - mixing regions allowed by the oscillation hypothesis .    in this work",
    "we have not analyzed the so - called upward - going muon data .",
    "these data are essentially consistent with no oscillations @xcite , although with large , non - cancelable flux errors  there are no `` upward - going electrons '' to be used for comparison .",
    "thus we expect that , in a combined analysis : ( 1 ) the upward - going muon data should have a smaller statistical weight than the atmospheric data considered here , which should drive the fit ; and ( 2 ) the inclusion of upward muon data should anyway disfavor a too strong suppression of the muon rates .",
    "this implies that the fit discussed in this section should be generally worsened for nearly maximal mixing ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the three - flavor analysis of upward - going muon data is in progress and will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "we recall that , in our framework , the subcase of pure @xmath3 oscillations is reached in the limit @xmath92 , which leaves @xmath93 as relevant variables .",
    "this limit is more complicated than the @xmath2 limit , since matter effects are not decoupled .",
    "it follows that the intervals @xmath94 $ ] and @xmath95 $ ] are not physically equivalent , and the scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) shown in fig",
    ".  1 are also not equivalent . however ,",
    "in the @xmath3 oscillation case there is an interesting symmetry : the physics in ( b ) is equivalent to the physics in ( a ) , provided that @xmath45 is replaced by its complementary angle ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "this symmetry ( discussed in appendix  c ) allows us to consider only one scenario , ( a ) for definiteness .    in fig .",
    "4 , we show the results of our @xmath3 oscillation analysis in scenario ( a ) .",
    "the corresponding results in scenario ( b ) are obtained by looking at the same figure in a mirror . since the panels in fig .",
    "4 ( @xmath3 case ) are analogous to the panels in fig .",
    "2 ( @xmath2 case ) we just highlight the differences between the results in figs .  4 and 2 .    at large @xmath4 ,",
    "the maximal mixing value @xmath97 is in general disfavored , since `` too many '' @xmath88 s oscillate into @xmath62 s , the muon ( electron ) rate become too suppressed ( enhanced ) , and thus the flavor anomaly is overbalanced by the oscillations . in fig .",
    "2 this situation was also disfavored , but not as strongly , since in the @xmath2 case the electron rates are unaffected by oscillations .    at small @xmath4 ,",
    "the contours are affected by the earth matter effects that are also responsible for the asymmetry with respect to the axis @xmath98 .",
    "notice that , in general , values of @xmath4 close to @xmath74 ev@xmath40 are more disfavored than in fig .  2 .",
    "the combination of all data is shown in the 11th panel of fig .  4 ( all sub - gev and multi - gev binned ) .",
    "the allowed region should be compared with the constraints coming from accelerator and reactor searches .",
    "these constraints essentially exclude the upper part of the region preferred by atmospheric @xmath7 data , but are compatible with the ( larger ) lower part .",
    "the best - fit for the combination of all data is obtained for @xmath99 . for scenario ( b )",
    ", the best - fit would be obtained at the symmetric point @xmath100 .",
    "the value of @xmath11 at the minimum is @xmath101 , about 4 units lower than in the case of @xmath2 oscillations @xmath102 .",
    "therefore @xmath3 oscillations appear to be preferred to @xmath2 oscillations in our global analysis .",
    "the preference for the @xmath3 case is essentially driven by the multi - gev data . in fig .  5",
    ", we show the measured and expected @xmath0-like and @xmath1-like event rates in the five zenith - angle bins used by the kamiokande collaboration for the multi - gev data .",

    ", only the theoretical muon rates can vary , and the fit is not particularly good , although certainly better than in the no - oscillation case .",
    "the third panel refers to pure @xmath3 oscillations . in this case , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 rates vary with oscillations , and one can get higher theoretical electron rates that match better the experimental data ( notice in particular the good fit in the first bin ) . the fourth panel refers to the general case of three - flavor oscillations , with @xmath6 unconstrained .",
    "the @xmath107 best - fit is only slightly better than in the @xmath3 case .",
    "the differences between the overall fits in the third and fourth panels are only appreciable numerically and not by eye . in conclusion ,",
    "@xmath3 oscillations seem to provide a close - to - optimal fit to multi - gev data .    in fig .",

    "4 differ considerably for low @xmath4 ; when matter effects are included ( fig .",
    "4 ) the lowest values of @xmath4 do not provide a good fit @xcite .",

    "we make the reasonable assumption that @xmath178 .",
    "then , since the ratios of @xmath7 and @xmath176 fluxes and cross sections are known at any energy , one can separate the distribution @xmath179 of parent _ neutrinos _ from the distribution @xmath180 of parent _ antineutrinos_.",
    "in @xcite we examined the various sources of uncertainties affecting the measured and expected @xmath1-like and @xmath0-like event rates @xmath181 and @xmath182 in the atmospheric neutrino experiments , together with their correlations .",
    "we were thus able , for any single experiment , to construct the covariance matrix of the residuals ( @xmath183 ) and to perform a correct ( gaussian ) statistical analysis of the atmospheric @xmath7 anomaly .",
    "as far as a single experiment is concerned , here we use the same approach .    however , when the information of two or more experiments is combined  as in the present work ",
    "one has also to take into account that the theoretical errors of the neutrino fluxes are highly correlated from experiment to experiment .",
    "for instance , a hypothetical systematic shift of @xmath184 in the calculated ( unoscillated ) flux of sub - gev @xmath62 s propagates coherently to the expected rates of @xmath1-like events in _ all _ the sub - gev experiments at the same time .",
    "moreover , one also expects the @xmath0-like event rates to increase by @xmath185 because of the tight correlation of calculated @xmath62 and @xmath88 fluxes , with an allowance for a residual uncertainty ( of about @xmath186 ) in the @xmath187 ratio .",
    "therefore , in constructing the covariance matrix for the observables analyzed in this work , we include the additional off - diagonal elements corresponding to the correlations of the neutrino flux uncertainties between any two experiments , and between any two bins of the kamiokande multi - gev data sample .",
    "more precisely , let us call @xmath188 a generic couple of experiments ( or couple of multi - gev data bins ) .",
    "then the correlations between the @xmath62 and @xmath88 theoretical flux errors in @xmath189 and @xmath190 are given by : @xmath191 where @xmath86 is the assumed fractional uncertainty in the overall flux normalization ( e.g. , @xmath192 ) , and @xmath193 is the assumed residual uncertainty in the @xmath187 ratio ( typically @xmath89 , which we choose as default value ) .",
    "for instance , for @xmath194 the @xmath0-@xmath1 flux error correlation is @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "we have decided , however , to ignore the correlations when a labels a sub - gev observable _ and _ b labels a multi - gev observable ( or vice  versa ) .",
    "in fact , the flux of low - energy and high - energy neutrinos are not necessarily correlated .",
    "a systematic shift of , e.g. , @xmath184 in the low - energy neutrino flux normalization does not necessarily imply the same shift at higher energy .",
    "this would happen , for instance , if the _ slope _ of the theoretical neutrino energy distribution were systematically biased . at present",
    ", we do not know how to relate the uncertainties affecting the low - energy and the high - energy fluxes of atmospheric neutrinos , and thus ignore their possible correlations in the @xmath11 statistics .",
    "the inclusion of the ( known ) correlation effects in any single experiment , as well as in the combination of all the experimental data , is a distinguishing feature of our analysis .",
    "in this appendix we discuss several symmetry properties of the neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities under given transformations of the neutrino masses and mixing , in the two scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .  1",
