    "coalescing black hole - neutron star ( bhns ) binaries , as well as other compact binaries composed of neutron stars and/or black holes , are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves for both ground - based @xcite and space - based laser interferometers @xcite .",
    "bhns binary mergers are also candidate central engines of short - hard gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) ( see , e.g. @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "the remnants of both bhns binary mergers @xcite and binary neutron star mergers @xcite are feasible progenitors for sgrbs because both may result in black holes surrounded by hot , massive accretion disks with very little , if any , baryon contamination along the polar symmetry axis .    motivated by these factors ,",
    "considerable effort has gone into the study of bhns binaries .",
    "most approaches to date assume newtonian gravity in either some or all aspects of the calculation ( see , e.g.  @xcite for quasiequilibrium calculations and @xcite for dynamical simulations ) .",
    "more recently , several groups have also studied bhns binaries in a fully relativistic framework , both for quasiequilibrium models @xcite and dynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "our group has pursued a systematic approach to developing increasingly realistic models of bhns binaries in quasiequilibrium circular orbits .",
    "our first studies @xcite assumed extreme mass ratios , i.e. , black hole masses that are much greater than the neutron star mass . while this is a very natural first step from a computational point of view , binaries with comparable masses are much more interesting from the perspective of ground - based gravitational wave observations and for the launching of sgrbs .",
    "more recently we have therefore relaxed this assumption and have extended our results to the case of comparable - mass bhns binaries @xcite .",
    "specifically , in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) we constructed quasiequilibrium models by solving einstein s constraint equations in the conformal thin - sandwich formalism , assuming conformal flatness and maximal slicing , together with the relativistic equations of hydrostationary equilibrium .",
    "we accounted for the black hole by excising a coordinate sphere and imposing the equilibrium black - hole boundary conditions of cook and pfeiffer @xcite .",
    "this original version implemented a ",
    "leading - order \" approximation to nonspinning black holes , which equates an otherwise undetermined spin parameter @xmath1 that appears in the boundary condition for the shift vector with the orbital angular velocity seen by an inertial observer at infinity , @xmath2 . as for the original irrotational binary black hole models of @xcite",
    ", this condition does not lead to simultaneous turning points of the binding energy and the total angular momentum in constant - mass sequences in paper i. such simultaneous turning points are expected for those sequences if they are truly in quasiequilibrium @xcite .",
    "an improvement over this condition , namely to iterate over @xmath1 until the quasilocal spin angular momentum of the black hole vanishes , was suggested and implemented for binary black holes by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we reconstruct quasiequilibrium models of bhns binaries using the same techniques as in paper i , but with the improved black hole spin angular velocity condition as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we then compute sequences of bhns binaries in quasicircular orbits for a wider range of neutron star masses and binary mass ratios than in paper i , focusing our attention on irrotational neutron stars orbiting nonspinning black holes . here",
    "we focus only on the irrotational state for the neutron star because it is astrophysically considered to be more realistic in a bhns binary @xcite . on the other hand , we will compute the case of spinning black holes in future work . as was the case for the irrotational black hole binaries constructed in @xcite , we find that this improved condition for the spin parameter of the black hole @xmath1 does lead to simultaneous turning points in the binding energy and the total angular momentum along constant - mass sequences .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review the basic equations in section ii .",
    "we present numerical results in section iii , and outline some qualitative considerations concerning the fate of bhns binaries in section iv . in section v we summarize our findings . throughout this paper",

    "latin and greek indices denote purely spatial and spacetime components , respectively .",
    "in this section we review the equations we solve to construct a quasiequilibrium bhns binary .",
    "the equations are very similar to those in paper i , but , as we explain below , we have improved both our algorithm for the solution of the gravitational field equations and the method to compute the spin parameter @xmath1 that appears in the black hole boundary condition for the shift vector . for a more detailed discussion about the formalism we use here ,",

    "the spatial metric @xmath11 is further decomposed according to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the conformal factor and @xmath15 the conformal background spatial metric , defined such that @xmath16 in cartesian coordinates .",

    "( [ eq : kdot ] ) above , or equivalently eq . ( 9 ) in paper i. this term falls off like @xmath51 , and hence more slowly than @xmath52 . eliminating this term therefore enhances the accuracy of the numerical solution",
    ". we will quantify the improvement in section [ sec : iiib ] .      in order to solve the gravitational field equations ( [ eq : ham_constr ] ) , ( [ eq : mom_constr ] ) , and ( [ eq : trace_evolv ] ) , we have to impose appropriate boundary conditions on two different boundaries : outer boundaries at spatial infinity and inner boundaries on the black hole horizons .",
    "the boundary conditions at spatial infinity follow from the assumption of asymptotic flatness . with the help of a radial coordinate transformation @xmath53 in the external computational domain",

    "we express the shift vector @xmath10 in a corotating coordinate system that we adopt throughout our calculation . in an inertial coordinate system",
    ", the shift vector would tend to zero at spatial infinity , while in the corotating coordinate system of the numerical code the shift vector diverges at spatial infinity . for computational purposes , it is therefore convenient to write the shift vector as a sum of the rotational shift term @xmath56 and a residual part ( which tends to zero at spatial infinity ) , and solve the equations only for the latter .",
    "the inner boundary conditions arise from the excision of the black hole interior .",

    "the boundary condition on the lapse function can be chosen freely . in this paper , we choose a neumann boundary condition @xmath73 on the excised surface .",

    "we use a larger number of collocation points for the black hole domains than for the neutron star domains because the source terms of the black hole equations are sensitive to the resolution of the neutron star . since the black hole domains are centered on the black hole , we need a higher angular resolution to adequately resolve these source terms .",
    "the neutron star equations , on the other hand , have large source terms only near the neutron star . since the neutron star domains are centered on the neutron star ,",
