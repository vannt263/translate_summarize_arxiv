    "dissipationless cosmological simulations have contributed substantially to our understanding of the structure and evolution of cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes , showing them to have triaxial shapes ( frenk et al .",

    "this universal cuspy profile appears in conflict with several observations , for example , the slow increase of rotation velocity with radius at the centre of low surface brightness galaxies ( flores & primack 1994 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ; moore et al 1999 ; salucci , yegorova & drory 2008 ) and the relatively weak concentration of galaxy clusters inferred from strong lensing ( sand et al . 2008 ) .",
    "additional evidence supporting central dark matter densities lower than predicted by cdm models comes from the difficulty in simultaneously matching observed luminosity functions and the zero - point of the tully - fisher relation ( e.g. dutton , van den bosch & courteau 2008 ) . recently",
    ", navarro et al . ( 2008 , hereafter n08 ) analysed in detail the density profiles of very high - resolution dark matter - only simulations of six milky way mass haloes from the aquarius project ( springel et al .",
    "they found the innermost cusps in these haloes to be weaker than claimed in some earlier work , and showed how halo - to - halo variations in radial structure reflect the detailed formation histories of individual haloes ( see also vogelsberger et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "galaxy formation might reinforce such history - specific features in the dark matter distribution , since baryons are subject to dissipative processes such as cooling , star formation and feedback in addition to gravity .",
    "the condensation of baryons within dark matter haloes modifies both their dynamics and their structure , but exactly how this happens is still quite uncertain .",
    "the simplest model assumes that the dark halo is compressed radially and adiabatically by the added mass at its centre ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 , hereafter b86 ; see eggen et al .",
    "1962 , zeldovich et al . 1980 and",
    "barnes & white 1984 for previous applications of this formalism ) .",
    "recent simulations have found the very simple adiabatic compression ( ac ) scheme of b86 to overestimate the effect ( e.g. gnedin et al .",
    "2004 and abadi et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter g04 and a09 , respectively ; pedrosa , tissera & scannapieco 2010 ) but it is nevertheless often used in simplified modelling of galaxy formation ( e.g. mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "more sophisticated ac models , based , for example , on the formalism of young ( 1980 ) have claimed to reproduce better the contraction and the final shape of haloes ( g04 ; sellwood & mcgaugh 2005 ) .",
    "the common outcome of these schemes is nevertheless an increase in the dark matter density in the central regions , exacerbating the problem of reconciling @xmath1cdm models with observation .",
    "simulations of galaxy formation which follow both dark matter and baryons in their proper cosmological context are the primary tool for studying how galaxy assembly affects dark matter haloes .",
    "there are many papers devoted to this subject . improving numerical algorithms and increasing",
    "computer power have led to continual progress in understanding the complex interplay between these two components .",
    "previous analyses of the evolution of dark haloes in hydrodynamical simulations have reported an increase both of the central mass concentration and of the central velocity dispersion , which no longer shows the temperature inversion characteristic of dissipationless cdm haloes ( e.g. katz & gunn 1991 ; evrard , summers & davis 1994 ; navarro & white 1994 ; tissera & dominguez - tenreiro 1998 ; oorbe et al . 2008 ; romano - diaz et al .",
    "recently , pedrosa , tissera & scannapieco ( 2009 , 2010 ) investigated how baryonic assembly history affects the dark matter distribution .",
    "they found the sn feedback process to play a key role by regulating star formation activity and ejecting material not only from the main system , but also from infalling satellites .",
    "it seems clear that the final distribution of baryons at the centre of a halo is insufficient to determine halo response to galaxy assembly , thus contradicting the ac hypothesis .",
    "typical dark matter haloes have long been reported to be triaxial with major to minor axis ratios often exceeding two in cdm - only simulations ( e.g. barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; frenk et al .",
    "1988 ; dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; jing & suto 2002 ; hayashi , navarro & springel 2007 ) . however , their shape changes , becoming more nearly oblate as baryons condense within them ( katz & gunn 1991 ; evrard et al .",

    "these results suggest the need for a comprehensive analysis of halo structure in simulations which include both the appropriate cosmological context and a realistic description of the physics of baryon condensation .",
    "it is clearly necessary to analyse a number of different galaxy - sized haloes in order to explore how differing assembly histories affect the structure of the final haloes .    in this paper",
    ", we study a set of high - resolution resimulations of the six galaxy - mass haloes of the aquarius project ( springel et al .",
    "these were carried out with a version of gadget-3 which includes a multi - phase treatment of metal - dependent cooling , star formation and sn feedback ( scannapieco et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "the original haloes were selected from a cosmological cdm - only simulation with no restriction on merger history , except that implied by eliminating objects with high - mass close neighbours .",
    "this aquarius halo set is well - suited to study how formation history and baryonic condensation together determine the final structure of dark matter haloes .",
    "our ability to isolate these effects is aided by comparing results from our hydrodynamical simulations ( hereafter sph runs ) with corresponding results from the cdm - only simulations ( hereafter dm runs ) as reported by n08 .",
    "properties of the galaxies in these haloes are studied in scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and will be further analysed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe the numerical experiments . in section 3 , we analyse the dark matter density profiles . section 4 , describes the velocity dispersion structure of our haloes . in section 5 , we study the effects of baryons on the pseudo - phase - space density profile , while section 6 discusses halo shapes .",
    "section 7 compares the change in halo circular velocity profile between the sph and the dm runs with the predictions of ac models .",
    "finally , in section 8 , we summarize our main findings .",
    "the six haloes studied in this paper were taken from the aquarius project ( springel et al .",
    "they were selected at random from a lower resolution version of the @xmath2 millennium - ii simulation ( boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2009 ) subject only to the requirements that their mass should be similar to that inferred for the milky way s halo and that they should have no close massive neighbour .",
    "dark matter only versions of these haloes were then resimulated at a variety of much higher resolutions as part of the aquarius project itself ( springel et al .",
    "2008 ; n08 ; vogelsberger et al .",
    "2009 ) . the lowest resolution version of each halo ( designated as resolution level 5 ) was also resimulated with detailed modelling of baryonic processes by scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter s09 ) .",
    "details of how the initial conditions were created can be found in these two papers . in the following",
    "we will refer to the original aquarius simulations at the higher resolution level 2 as the dm simulations , and to the simulations of s09 , which have roughly 200 times worse dark matter mass resolution but include the baryonic physics , as the sph simulations .",
    "the analysis in n08 shows that the properties of the dark haloes which concern us in this paper are extremely well numerically converged all the way down to resolution level 5 .",
    "the individual haloes are labelled aq - a-@xmath3 , aq - b-@xmath3 , etc . , with @xmath3 corresponding to the resolution level in to be consistent with the convention in the earlier papers .",
    "the millennium and millennium - ii simulations , and thus also these halo simulations , were carried out assuming a @xmath1cdm cosmology with parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "evolution in both the dm and the sph simulations was followed from @xmath7 to @xmath8 using versions of gadget-3 , an update of gadget-2 ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ; springel 2005 ) optimized for massively parallel simulation of highly inhomogeneous systems such as individual dark haloes .",
    "the version of gadget-3 used for the sph runs includes a multiphase model for the gas component with metal - dependent cooling , star formation and phase - dependent treatments of sn feedback and chemical enrichment , as set out in scannapieco et al .",

    "the model describes chemical enrichment by snii and snia separately , using appropriate yields and delays ( mosconi et al .",
    "2001 ; scannapieco et al .",
    "the multiphase treatment of both hydrodynamics and feedback is quite effective in reproducing the observed phenomenology of star formation and wind - generation in both quiescent and starburst galaxies . without introducing system - specific parameters",
    ", the scheme produces substantial mass - loaded galactic winds in rapidly star - forming systems with speeds that reflect the escape velocity much as in observed galaxies ( scannapieco et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "this freedom from _ ad hoc _ scale - dependent parameters , makes the algorithm particularly suited for studying galaxy formation in its cosmological context , since the simultaneous formation of systems of widely differing mass is the norm in this situation .",
    "the sph runs have maximum gravitational softenings in the range @xmath9kpc . to prevent spurious results due to limited numerical resolution in the innermost regions , we analyse halo properties only outside @xmath10kpc in all our systems .",
    "haloes are considered bounded by their virial radius @xmath11 defined as the largest radius within which the mean enclosed density exceeds @xmath12 times the critical density .",
    "the simulated sph haloes have @xmath13 million particles in total within this virial radius while the dm simulations have approximately @xmath14 particles in the same region .",
    "the virial masses of the six systems are in the range @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "hence , dark matter particles in the sph runs have masses of the order @xmath17 while gas particles initially have @xmath18 . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we summarize the principal characteristics of our sph simulations .",
    "we also include the corresponding information for two lower resolution versions of halo aq - e .",
    "we find convergent results between aq - e-5 and aq - e-6 for their characteristic properties .",
    "however , for the lowest resolution run , aq - e-7 , larger differences are found . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the effects of numerical resolution on the dark matter distributions .",
    "the aquarius haloes have varied assembly histories and these produce a variety of structures and star formation histories for their central galaxies , even though the simulations were all run with similar sf and sn feedback parameters .",
    "a detailed description of the code and the parameters adopted can be found in s09 , together with images of the central galaxies and considerable analysis of their structure .",
    "here we provide a brief summary so that the reader has a general picture of the central galaxies of the haloes we analyse here .    in all six galaxies star formation peaked between 13 gyr ( aq - c-5 ) and 10 gyr ( aq - b-5 ) ago and there has been rather little star formation over the last 8 gyr .",
    "the total stellar masses at @xmath8 are in the range @xmath19 to @xmath20 and are listed in table  [ tab1 ] , along with the total masses and baryon masses of the @xmath8 haloes and the numbers of simulation particles representing these masses .",
    "the analysis of s09 showed that most of the central galaxies contain centrifugally supported disks , although none of these accounts for more than about a fifth of the total stellar mass .",
    "aq - f-5 is an exception in that it has no disk , only a spheroidal component .",
    "this can be traced to the fact that the system underwent a major merger at @xmath21 . in some cases",
    "the stellar spheroid has substantial nett rotation ( aq - e-5 ) while in others it retains very little angular momentum ( aq - a-5 ) .",
    "all the galaxies have been substantially affected by sn feedback , which drives winds which limit their mass . in all cases",
    "the baryon fraction within the virial radius is around 10% , significantly smaller than the global value , @xmath22 .    [",

    "we have constructed spherically - averaged dark matter density profiles from @xmath23kpc to the virial radius @xmath11 .",
    "the inner radius is four times the gravitational softening for three of our simulations ( a , b and d ) and twice the gravitational softening in the other three .",
    "it typically contains more than a thousand dark matter particles . finding an appropriate centre is crucial to obtaining accurate profiles .",
    "here we use the shrinking sphere technique as laid out in of power et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in practise",
    ", this gives a centre very close to the minimum of the gravitational potential in all our systems .",
    "we have measured profiles both including and excluding substructures , but this only causes rather minor effects in the outer regions . in the following we use the full dm mass including substructures in order to be able to compare consistently with the results of n08 .",
    "note that we re - normalize the dark matter profiles of n08 by the global dm fraction of @xmath24 adopted in the sph simulations when comparing profiles from the two set - ups .    to characterise our dark matter profiles we adopt the three - parameter einasto model ( einasto 1965 ) which n08 found to give a relatively good fit to the profiles of the dm runs .",
    "this model has also been used by earlier authors to fit the dark matter distribution when baryons are included ( e.g. oorbe et al .",
    "2008 ; gao et al . 2008 ) .",
    "n08 parametrise the einasto profile using @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which indicate its curvature in a log - log plot , and the radius and density at the point where its logarithmic slope is @xmath28 , the isothermal value .",
    "we fit this formula , leaving all three parameters free , to our measured density profile at a set of points spaced logarithmically from @xmath23kpc to @xmath11 , minimising the rms residual in @xmath29 . in table  [ tab2 ] we give the results of these fits , together with the _ rms _ residual in @xmath29 . to facilitate the comparison with the dm runs , we also include the corresponding parameters given by n08 ; note that these were obtained for fits over a slightly wider radial range .",
    "we see that in all cases @xmath30 and @xmath25 are both smaller for the simulations which include baryons , showing that the condensation of the galaxy has increased the concentration of the halo and given it a density profile which is approximately isothermal over a wider radial range than in the dm - only case .",
    "the residuals in @xmath29 are only slightly larger , showing that the einasto profile is a good fit to both the sph and the dm runs .",

    "[ haloes ] where we compare the spherically - averaged dark matter density profiles of the haloes in our sph runs ( solid lines ) to the corresponding profiles for the dm runs from n08 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "every sph profile lies below its corresponding dm profile at large radii and above it at small radii . in all cases the two profiles cross at , or slightly inside , the baryonic radius of the central galaxy , which we define to be the radius containing 83% of its stars and cold gas . inside the baryonic radius ,",
    "the sph profiles are all relatively flat , and so approximately `` isothermal '' .",
    "this is indicated more explicitly in the insets in fig .  [ haloes ]",
    "which plot the logarithmic derivatives of the two profiles as a function of radius .",
    "this slope changes smoothly with radius in most of the dm haloes , but shows a clear change in behaviour in the inner regions in many of the sph haloes . for aq - a-5 , aq - c-5 and aq - e-5",
    ", we detect a change in the logarithmic derivatives of the sph profiles at the smallest radii suggesting a flattening of the profiles .",
    "however , this occurs very close to our resolution limit and therefore , should be viewed with caution . at radii well outside the central galaxy",
    "the sph profiles parallel the dm profiles quite closely , and indeed the offset between them is close to the renormalisation factor that we introduced to account for the difference in the total amount of dark matter in the two kinds of simulation .",
    "we have looked for correlations between the changes in @xmath25 and @xmath26 and various other parameters of our haloes , in particular , their spin parameter , the fraction of the baryons gathered in the central galaxy , and their disk - to - total mass ratio .",
    "however , in no case did we find a clear trend .    to study the robustness of our results against numerical resolution , we analysed the dark matter profiles of the two lower resolution versions of halo aq - e .",

    "the velocity dispersion structure of the dark matter haloes in the dm runs has been analysed by n08 , who show that they all have a temperature inversion in the central region ( i.e. the velocity dispersion drops towards the centre at small radii ) but that there is no simple regularity among the haloes .",
    "rather there is considerable diversity which seems to reflect the variety of formation paths possible for these galaxy - sized haloes in the @xmath1-cdm cosmology .",

    "the conventional velocity anisotropy parameter , defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are tangential and radial dispersions averaged over spherical shells , gives some indication of the internal orbital structure of the haloes .",
    "as shown by n08 , the dm runs are almost isotropic ( @xmath34 ) in their inner regions , then in most cases become progressively more radially biased ( @xmath35 ) with increasing radius out to about @xmath26 before becoming more isotropic again at even larger radii .",

    "these plots show the directly measured dark matter circular velocities ( @xmath73^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath74 is the dark matter mass enclosed within @xmath42 ) in our sph ( red lines ) and dm ( black lines ) simulations and compares them to the curves predicted by modifying the result for the dm run according to each of the three recipes , assuming the baryon distribution found in the sph run .",
    "the dm profiles have been reduced by 8% to account for the global baryonic fraction of 0.16 adopted in the sph simulations . in the narrow panels at the bottom of each plot",
    "we show the residuals from the pure dm result for each of the models ( the three dashed curves ) and for the dark matter distribution actually found in the sph simulation ( the solid red curve ) . as expected , the ac model of b86 overpredicts the amount of dark matter in the central regions by up to @xmath75 or so .",
    "the g04 and a09 models provide a better representation with a09 being closer to the `` true '' result in most cases .",
    "however , for two haloes ( aq - b-5 and aq - d-5 ) , the a09 model underestimates the dark matter mass by several tens of percent at some radii .",
    "this is expected , since the abadi et al ( 2009 ) prescription is based on a large sample of dark matter haloes , and for individual haloes one can expect overestimates and underestimates in roughly equal numbers , just as we find .",
    "note that for aq - b-5 and aq - d-5 the g04 prescription actually gives the best description at all but the smallest radii .    in general terms ,",
    "the dark matter mass in the innermost regions is usually overpredicted and , more importantly , the shape of the circular velocity is often poorly matched by all of these models .",
    "at least in three of our haloes ( aq - a-5 , aq - c-5 and aq - e-5 ) , the velocity curves rise in the central region more gently than predicted by the models ( in agreement with fig.1 ) .",
    "we have analysed the dark matter distributions in six galaxy - sized haloes belonging to the aquarius project , comparing results from the original dark matter only simulations to those from re - simulations including baryonic processes ( s09 ) . in agreement with previous work",
    ", we find that dark matter haloes become more concentrated when baryons condense at their centres , but that the characteristics of the contraction do not correlate in a simple way with the total amount of baryons .",
    "our main contribution here is to analyse similar mass haloes with a variety of formation histories using high resolution simulations with and without baryons .",
    "our results show that the response of haloes to the presence of baryons is sensitive to the details of halo assembly .",
    "this set of six galaxy - sized haloes provides the opportunity to study which properties can be considered common to such haloes and which depend significantly on their particular formation history .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows :    * in the regions dominated by baryons , haloes become significantly more concentrated than their dark matter only counterparts .",
    "the level of concentration varies significantly from object to object , however , it is not simply related to the total baryonic mass accumulated in the central galaxy . for @xmath39 , the dark matter density profiles of many of our simulations are nearly isothermal except , possibly , very close to the centre . *",
    "the velocity dispersion structure is modified in all haloes , with velocity dispersion increasing monotonically to small radii in all cases .",
    "the temperature inversion of nfw profiles is no longer present once the galaxy has formed .",
    "in some systems , the tangential dispersion increases more than the radial dispersion ( but not all ) , causing them to become more nearly isotropic . * the @xmath45-@xmath46 relation proposed by hansen & moore ( 2006 ) is obeyed at most over a restricted radial range for some of our haloes .",
    "it works best in the central region of those systems where the isothermal behaviour extends over a relatively small range .",
    "the departures from their predictions become large when the profile is isothermal or has constant anisotropy over an extended radial range . *",
    "pseudo - phase - space density no longer follows the same power law in radius as in bertschinger s ( 1985 ) similarity solution once galaxy formation is included .",
    "the profile differs from one halo to the next and in no halo is it consistent with the purely adiabatic contraction of the dark matter only case . * as in previous work , the condensation of baryons makes the central regions of all our haloes less aspherical and more nearly oblate , although in two cases the changes are small .",
    "one of these has no significant disk component and the other has a bulge with substantial nett rotation . *",
    "none of the simple adiabatic contraction models proposed in earlier work is able to describe how the radial density profiles of our haloes are modified by baryon condensation .",
    "the scheme suggested by abadi et al ( 2009 ; see also pedrosa et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ) is the most successful of those we consider , although it can significantly over- or underestimate the effects in individual cases .",
    "for the same haloes , the central mass is overestimated by more than @xmath75 .",
    "the circular velocity curves of our galaxy formation simulations are not as centrally peaked as predicted by such adiabatic contraction models , but are still more rapidly rising than in many observed spirals .",
    "since none of our simulated galaxies is disk - dominated it is unclear whether this is a problem .    our analysis show that haloes of similar virial mass respond in different ways to baryon condensation depending on the details of their assembly history .",
    "consequently , a much more detailed understanding of galaxy formation is needed before we can make reliable predictions for the detailed structure of the dark matter haloes surrounding galaxies .",
    "we thank the referee of this paper for her / his useful comments that helped to improved this paper .",
