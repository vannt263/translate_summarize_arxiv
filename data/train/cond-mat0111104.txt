    "the heart of the kondo phenomena is in the infrared divergences or the orthogonality catastrophe .",
    "those phenomena occur in the neighborhood of the fermi energy .",
    "thus , breaking the electron - hole symmetry on the large energy scale of the conduction band width does not enter directly . in the first iterations of the scaling at large energy scale that may , however , induce non - universal effects .    in the first part of this paper , the spin kondo problem with asymmetric bandwidth cutoff is studied .",
    "the results are somewhat unexpected , as the generated potential scattering in the intermediate energy region plays a relevant role in the scaling equations , which is not the case for symmetric bands .",
    "two examples are presented where the breaking of the electron - hole symmetry leads to instabilities of the scaling trajectories .",
    "the first example is a two - level impurity model with commutative couplings where there is an additional potential scattering at the impurity site which generates non - commutative terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the other one is a two - level system with two - channel kondo behavior , where the spin degeneracy is broken by spin - orbit scatterings in the neighborhood of the impurity atom . in both cases",
    "the energy splitting or direct tunneling generates the non - universal terms via the asymmetric band , but as those parameters also play the role of the infrared cutoff in the scaling the new fixed point can not be reached .    in the last part , the tunneling impurity model with higher excitations in the potential",
    "well is discussed .",
    "the question of physical realization is not raised , it is only shown that the behavior in the high energy region of the scaling can be modified by the electron - hole symmetry breaking .",
    "this may change the parameters entering into the low energy physics .",
    "treating the kondo problem in the framework of the logarithmic approximation , the following formulas are used for the energy integrals @xmath0 and for @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy variable , @xmath4 is the fermi distribution function , and @xmath5 is the conduction electron density of states which is approximated by a constant @xmath6 inside the region @xmath7 , @xmath8 being an energy cutoff , e.g. the bandwidth .",
    "those approximations do not affect the infrared divergent parts proportional to @xmath9 , but the non - diverging terms can strongly depend on any deviation from those .",
    "furthermore , the dependence on the wave number @xmath10 for an electron with energy @xmath11 is replaced by the value at the fermi energy @xmath12 , thus @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fermi velocity .",
    "all of these approximations can be considered to be due to the electron - hole symmetry ( e - h.s . ) .",
    "that symmetry can be broken e.g. by introducing an energy dependent density of states ( see e.g. ref . ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 , in general , is of order of unity due to band structure effects , or by using different upper and lower cutoffs as @xmath17 and @xmath18 instead of @xmath8 .",
    "another way@xcite to break the e - h.s . is to introduce a local potential @xmath19 for the electron e.g. at the impurity site @xmath20 .",
    "the generally accepted approximation has been suggested by haldane@xcite for the case with different @xmath21 as @xmath22 which only slightly affects the different quantities due to the modified cutoff @xmath23 .",

    "the corrections to the conduction electron green s function due to the interaction with the spin - orbit scatterer in appropriate coordinate systems for the tls / electron orbital momentum and for the electron spin spaces ( see fig .",
    "[ figo1 ] ) can be summed up to infinite order , resulting in the following change in the density of states of the conduction electrons@xcite @xmath79 where the correct dispersion given by eq .",

    "( [ deltarho ] ) ) , apart from the change @xmath84 , a new kind of coupling is generated@xcite in a form @xmath85 where the @xmath86 indices label the tls states .",

    "( [ ehsb ] ) for the conduction electron density of states in the calculation .",
    "the leading logarithmic scaling equations are generated by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] with the general couplings at the vertices and the splitting @xmath90 and the spontaneous tunneling @xmath66@xcite at the `` crosses '' on the tls line . as the scaling equations with the initial conditions are closed for the subspace @xmath91",
    ", we can restrict the general equations to those values and then define the `` average '' and the `` difference '' parts of the couplings as @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the couplings for up and down electron spins , respectively .",
    "the initial values at @xmath95 are @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and the other differences are zero ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "after linearization in the differences , the scaling equations for the averages decouple from the others , and it turns out that in leading order in @xmath101 , @xmath102 the solution for the averages is the usual one@xcite , except that couplings @xmath103 are generated@xcite . solving the scaling equations for the differences also in first order in @xmath101 , @xmath102 , most of the differences remain zero , except @xmath104 where the @xmath105 indices are according to our special coordinate system@xcite ( see fig .  [ figo1 ] ) . from the solution of the equations for those couplings we could conclude@xcite , that while @xmath106 remains unrenormalized during scaling , the couplings @xmath107 are growing like the usual solution for the averages multiplied by @xmath101 , @xmath102 , but only if @xmath72 , thus the e - h.s . is broken .",
    "thus , due to the interaction of the conduction electrons with a spin - orbit scatterer in a position @xmath78 according to the tls , new , relevant , real spin dependent ( thus channel degeneracy breaking ) couplings between tls and conduction electrons are generated in the case of e - h.s . breaking .",
    "the situation is similar to the case presented in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . the e - h.s . breaking breaks the channel symmetry .",
    "the crossover between the 2ck and 1ck behavior , however , can not be reached as the @xmath108 terms contain the factor @xmath101 or @xmath102 which is very small .",
    "thus , again the channel symmetry breaking is driven by @xmath90 or @xmath66 , but the same quantities stop the scaling long before the crossover is reached .",
    "thus , this can not be relevant in the interpretation of the experimental data@xcite .",
    "considering the interaction between a tls and electrons the strength of the electron assisted transition is not strong enough to obtain a kondo temperature @xmath52 which is required to fit experimental data .",
    "it was suggested@xcite that the electron assisted transition to excited states with energies above the two lowest levels may give an essential contribution to the electron assisted transition amplitudes @xmath64 and @xmath65 , but keeping only a few excited state levels gives unphysical results@xcite .",
    "here it is only shown in which sense the argument@xcite can be sensitive to e - h.s@xcite .",
    "the energy levels of the motion of the localized atom are denoted by @xmath109 , their wave functions are @xmath110 and the interaction between the electrons and the atoms is described by the hamiltonian @xmath111 where the local interaction strength is @xmath112 and the atom in orbital @xmath113 of the potential well is created by the operator @xmath114 . now again the two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] should be considered .",
    "consider , e.g. , the first diagram . in order to study the scaling equations ,",
    "the derivative @xmath115 must be taken , and only the intermediate states with energies @xmath116 are contributing .",
    "then the contribution arising from the region of the cutoff @xmath8 is ( assuming that the wave function of the atom depends on @xmath61 ) , @xmath117 where @xmath3 is the incoming energy and @xmath118 . as it has been pointed out by aleiner _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , if @xmath8 is large enough , then @xmath119 covers a large enough number of states that the approximate sum rule due to approximate completeness of the states , @xmath120 is satisfied and then the contribution is simplified to @xmath121 the second diagram has exactly the same contribution but @xmath122 is replaced by @xmath123 .",
    "thus if @xmath124 holds , there is an exact cancellation .",
    "however , that cancellation in the renormalization group equation completely relies on the holding of e - h.s .",
    "that is again an example , where results can be essentially affected by breaking the e - h.s .",
    "it is clear , however , that the e - h.s breaking terms do not lead to infrared divergences and can be relevant only in the vicinity of the unrenormalized cutoff .",
    "moving further from the cutoff region the e - h.s .",
    "is gradually restored .",
    "thus , the cancellation takes place .",
    "the sum of the two diagrams contribute again in the region where the sum rule given by eq .",
    "( [ sumrule ] ) does not hold , having only a few levels labeled by @xmath125 .",
    "thus the e - h.s .",
    "breaking has an effect only through the possible enhancement of the couplings entering in the treatment of that second region .",
