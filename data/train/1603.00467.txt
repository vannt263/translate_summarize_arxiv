    "because the long - term evolution of the neutron - star - merger ejecta should resemble that of the supernova ejecta , i.e. , supernova remnants @xcite , cosmic rays should be accelerated at the shock associated with the blast - wave interaction between the ejecta and interstellar medium @xcite . if the ejecta from any event contain _",
    "r_-process elements , they could be accelerated when the reverse shock sweeps into the ejecta , and the amount of accelerated _ r_-process elements ( hereafter , _",

    "this suggests that the flux of _ r_-process cosmic rays could enable us to distinguish the nucleosynthesis sites , namely the supernova or the neutron star merger .",

    "the reason for this difference is the high velocity of the neutron - star - merger ejecta , which can increase the total energy of the _ r_-process cosmic rays for a given mass of _ r_-process elements .",
    "second , the observed cosmic rays do not show selective enhancement of _",
    "r_-process elements and are known to be consistent with the solar abundance at the acceleration sites @xcite .",

    "the relative mass fraction of _",

    "r_-process yield per event .",
    "the amount of _",

    "on one hand , the galactic supernova rate is estimated to be @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the single - event yield of _",
    "r_-process elements should be @xmath6 if the supernova is the production site .",
    "this value should be compared with the typical mass of the supernova ejecta , @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore the fraction of _",
    "r_-process elements is @xmath8 on the other hand , the galactic neutron - star - merger rate is estimated to be @xmath9 with a large uncertainty @xcite .",
    "this gives us an estimate of the single - event yield as @xmath10 for the neutron - star - merger scenario .",
    "assuming that all the ejecta material is synthesized to _",
    "r_-process elements @xcite , i.e. , @xmath11 this value is consistent with the typical ejecta mass @xmath12 obtained by general - relativistic hydrodynamical simulations @xcite and is also roughly sufficient to power a possible macronova / kilonova associated with grb 130603b @xcite ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is widely accepted that galactic cosmic rays are accelerated from the inter / circumstellar material at the forward shock of blast waves associated with the supernova ejecta , whereas the acceleration mechanism is not fully understood yet .",
    "this scenario requires a fraction @xmath13 of the ejecta kinetic energy to be converted to the cosmic - ray energy .",
    "we use the fiducial value , @xmath14 , for both the supernova and neutron - star - merger forward shocks in this study .",
    "it should be cautioned that the neutron - star - merger remnants could be different from the supernova remnants in the nonspherical geometry and in the circumburst medium that is not affected by winds or precursors @xcite .",
    "the most uncertain quantity is the fraction of the energy given to cosmic rays at the reverse shock to that at the forward shock , @xmath15 .",
    "this fraction is crucial for the total energy of the _ r_-process cosmic rays , because they are expected to be accelerated not only at the forward shock but also at the reverse shock sweeping into the ejecta .",
    "we take a provisional value of this fraction to be @xmath16 for both the supernova and neutron - star - merger ejecta , because this is an upper limit derived by the condition that the reverse - shock acceleration does not dominate the forward - shock acceleration for the elements synthesized in the supernova ( see the next section ) .",
    "the discussion on the _ r_-process cosmic rays will impose a tighter constraint on the acceleration efficiency at the reverse shock , @xmath17 , in the neutron - star - merger scenario .    before closing this section",
    ", we caution that both @xmath18 and @xmath15 can be different between the supernova ejecta and the neutron - star - merger ejecta . in the next section ,",
    "we tentatively take common values for them to estimate _",
    "r_-process cosmic rays in the neutron - star - merger nucleosynthesis scenario .",
    "after that , we derive constraints on these parameters separately for the supernova and the neutron star merger .",
    "we focus on the flux at the lowest energy range for _ r_-process cosmic rays , @xmath19 . in this range ,",
    "the flux is determined primarily by the total energy or injection rate of _ r_-process cosmic rays irrespective of the spectral index , the prediction of which requires the precise knowledge of acceleration , escape , and propagation .",
    "the galactic confinement time does not affect comparisons among different acceleration sites , because it should be determined solely by the rigidity .",
    "although the composition changes moderately during the galactic propagation , this again does not affect the comparisons .",
    "first , we estimate the energy injection rate of _ r_-process cosmic rays out of the inter / circumstellar material at the forward shock associated with the supernova ejecta . taking the typical kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta to be @xmath20 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the energy injection rate of cosmic rays is estimated to be @xmath21 .",
    "this amount roughly matches the total generation rate of galactic cosmic rays estimated from the observation . if we assume that the cosmic - ray composition ratio is proportional to the elemental abundance , the energy injection rate of _ r_-process cosmic rays is given by @xmath22 we consider the enhancement of refractory and/or large - mass - number elements @xcite separately in the next section .",
    "the contribution from the forward shock associated with the neutron - star - merger ejecta is negligible due to the low event rate .",
    "next , we estimate the energy injection rate of _ r_-process cosmic rays for the supernova nucleosynthesis scenario . the energy injection rate of all the accelerated particles at the reverse shock is given by @xmath23 . taking @xmath24",
    ", we obtain @xmath25 again assuming that the cosmic - ray composition is given by the relative mass fraction .",
    "thus , if the supernova is the _",
    "r_-process nucleosynthesis site , we do not expect significant enhancement of _ r_-process cosmic rays compared to those from the inter / circumstellar material , @xmath26 , as far as @xmath27 .    finally , we estimate the energy injection rate of _ r_-process cosmic rays for the neutron - star - merger nucleosynthesis scenario . we take the ejecta kinetic energy to be a typical value derived by general - relativistic simulations of binary neutron star mergers , @xmath28 @xcite , which corresponds to the ejecta velocity @xmath29 with @xmath30 as the speed of light . using this value , the energy injection rate of _ r_-process cosmic rays is given by @xmath31 for our fiducial @xmath14 .",
    "to summarize , we obtain the ratios @xmath32 if we adopt the same values of @xmath18 and @xmath15 for both scenarios .",
    "this suggests that the flux of _ r_-process cosmic rays at @xmath19 could be enhanced by a few orders of magnitude compared to the expectation from the supernova forward shock with the solar composition if the _",
    "r_-process nucleosynthesis occurs in the neutron star merger , while the enhancement is not expected in the supernova scenario .",
    "note that the relation @xmath33 also holds for any lighter - than - iron product _ x _ of the supernova nucleosynthesis , so that the upper limit on the acceleration efficiency from the supernova nucleosynthesis is @xmath27 .",
    "otherwise , the cosmic - ray composition below the iron could have changed substantially from the solar composition ( beyond the spallation modification ) .",
    "the enormous enhancement for the neutron - star - merger scenario , despite the same total _ r_-process yields as the supernova scenario , is ascribed to the high ejecta velocity . to put it simply , the energy injection rate of _ r_-process cosmic rays at the reverse shock is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 stands for either sn or nsm , and thus the energy injection rate at the reverse shock is proportional to the squared ejecta velocity @xmath36 , which is larger by @xmath37 for the neutron star merger than for the supernova .",
    "this ratio is completely free from uncertainties associated with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the value of @xmath41 may span a range of @xmath42@xmath43 @xcite , and therefore its uncertainty may be much smaller than those of the event rate and ejecta mass .",
    "the above discussions are applicable even if the _",
    "r_-process elements are produced by rare events like the magnetorotational supernova ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given that the ejecta mass and energy are comparable to the normal supernova , the ejecta velocity is similar to @xmath44 , so that eqs .   and",
    "remain valid .",
    "the observations of heavy cosmic rays can be explained solely by the forward shock of supernova blast waves without invoking any contribution from the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "they find ( 1 ) similar enhancement by a factor of 2030 for iron - group and refractory _",
    "r / s_-process cosmic rays and ( 2 ) enhancement by a factor of 310 for volatile _",
    "r / s_-process cosmic rays .",
    "it is also found that the enhancement ratio may be correlated with the mass number of elements @xcite .",
    "it has to be cautioned that the measured elements are only classified by the charge , and the isotope ratios are not accurately measured .",
    "this precludes the clear distinction between _ r_-process and _ s_-process elements .",
    "however , no systematic difference in enhancement is found between _ r_-process - dominant elements such as the platinum and _ s_-process - dominant elements such as the cerium ( see , e.g. , table 1 of * ? ? ? * for the breakdown ) , and thus the enhancement is likely to be similar for both elements . the strong enhancement of the refractory elements is explained by efficient acceleration via suprathermal injection from dust grains @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the enhancement of _ s_-process cosmic rays is explained by neither the supernova nor neutron - star - merger ejecta , because the ejecta are hardly expected to be enriched by _",
    "s_-process elements .",
    "the observations do not support eq .   with @xmath45 ,",
    "i.e. , the selective _",
    "r_-process enhancement in heavy cosmic rays .",
    "this indicates the weakness of _ r_-process cosmic rays from the neutron star merger .",
    "the contribution from the neutron - star - merger ejecta to the enhancement should be less than a factor of three , i.e. , @xmath46 ; otherwise it contradicts the observations of refractory elements such as the zirconium relative to the iron and with the observations of volatile elements such as the krypton @xcite .    .",
    "the diagonal red lines show the enhancement ratio in the neutron - star - merger scenario for the _ r_-process nucleosynthesis , @xmath47 .",
    "the solid line is for our fiducial ejecta velocity , @xmath48 .",
    "the upper and lower dotted lines are for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , and are drawn to indicate the uncertainty estimate .",
    "the diagonal black dotted line at the bottom right is for the supernova nucleosynthesis scenario , @xmath51 .",
    "the horizontal blue line is the upper limit , @xmath52 , derived by the observation of heavy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "only the region below this line is allowed , and thus the acceleration efficiency higher than @xmath53 at the reverse shock is unlikely in the neutron - star - merger nucleosynthesis scenario .",
    "the vertical dotted line is the upper limit , @xmath54 , obtained from the condition that the lighter - than - iron cosmic rays are not dominated by the supernova reverse - shock component . ]",
    "the weakness or even absence of enhanced _",
    "r_-process cosmic rays places a constraint on particle acceleration at the reverse shock of blast waves associated with the neutron - star - merger ejecta .",
    "figure [ fig : param ] shows the allowed acceleration efficiency of _ r_-process cosmic rays at the reverse shock in the neutron - star - merger nucleosynthesis scenario .",
    "this figure indicates that , if the neutron - star - merger scenario is true , the reverse shock associated with the _ r_-process - dominated ejecta has to be an inefficient accelerator with @xmath55 this constraint is more severe by a factor of @xmath56 than that obtained from the observed cosmic rays of supernova nucleosynthesis products , @xmath57 , and could serve as important information for the physics of particle acceleration .",
    "how unreasonable this low acceleration efficiency is depends on the difference between the supernova and the neutron star merger .",
    "we could assume that the cosmic - ray energy is distributed according to the mass processed by the shock to argue that the low efficiency is a reasonable outcome of the high - velocity ejecta .",
    "assuming that the particle acceleration becomes inefficient at the time when the blast - wave velocity decreases to a fixed value of @xmath58 , at which the radiative cooling sets in , the mass swept by the forward shock before the termination of acceleration @xmath59 is expected to be proportional to @xmath60 due to the relation @xmath61 in the sedov  taylor phase .",
    "thus , using @xmath62 , we could expect @xmath63 .",
    "this possibility naturally explains the two - orders - of - magnitude - lower efficiency of the neutron - star - merger scenario , and moreover , predicts @xmath64 for the supernova and @xmath65 for the neutron star merger satisfying observational constraints .",
    "by contrast , we could also assume that the cosmic - ray energy is distributed according to the energy processed by the shock to argue that the low efficiency is unreasonable .",
    "in this case , the cosmic - ray energy increases in a self - similar manner during the sedov  taylor phase as @xmath66 in accordance with the self - similar hydrodynamic evolution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we could expect moderate dependence on the ejecta velocity as @xmath67 , and this predicts that the efficiency varies at most only by a factor of two to three between the supernova and the neutron star merger with @xmath68 for both cases .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider other reasons for the inefficiency of the reverse - shock acceleration in the neutron star merger .",
    "they may include weak magnetic fields in the ejecta , absence of _",
    "r_-process dust grains , and/or energy loss to the adiabatic expansion .",
    "the absence of _",
    "r_-process dust grains in the neutron - star - merger ejecta is consistent with the finding of @xcite , although this effect is not sufficient to fully account for the weakness .",
    "conversely , if the reverse shock turns out to be a moderately efficient accelerator for the neutron - star - merger ejecta , our result implies that the neutron star merger contributes very little or not at all to the galactic _",
    "r_-process enrichment .",
    "precise measurement of the cosmic - ray composition is useful to narrow down the uncertainty range . in particular , a detailed investigation of the difference between _ r_-process and _ s_-process cosmic - ray fluxes",
    "is highly appreciated , because the contribution from any ejecta is likely to be much larger in the _ r_-process enhancement than in the _ s_-process enhancement .",
    "moreover , uncertainties should be reduced if we compare elements with similar mass numbers and similar volatility . for this purpose , it is important to measure the isotope ratio of heavy cosmic rays to precisely separate _ r_-process and _ s_-process elements .",
    "we also have to understand nuclear interactions like spallation during the cosmic - ray propagation to precisely recover the composition at the acceleration site from the observed one .",
    "the velocity of the neutron - star - merger ejecta also requires an investigation . while it is safely expected that the ejecta velocity is higher for the neutron star merger than for the supernova , the precise value depends on the mass ejection mechanism .",
    "for example , the velocity is likely to become low if the late - time activity such as disk winds contributes substantially to the mass ejection @xcite .",
    "the velocity could be determined by observing synchrotron emission around the sedov time @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult to pin down the acceleration efficiency at the reverse shock accurately , while this is one of the last pieces to assess the plausibility of the neutron - star - merger scenario for the _ r_-process nucleosynthesis by studying cosmic rays .",
    "we could in principle infer the efficiency by observing reverse - shock emission , such as gamma - rays from hadronic interaction ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for leptonic emission from cas a )",
    ". however , the large distance of @xmath69 expected for a yearly neutron - star - merger event prohibits us from taking this approach in the real life @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations of the reverse - shock acceleration are highly desired , particularly for the _ r_-process - dominated ejecta .",
    "relevant topics include magnetic - field amplification from the value typical of neutron stars , injection of _",
    "r_-process elements involving possible dust formation , and energy loss to the adiabatic expansion before the escape .",
