    "it has been recently found @xcite that certain classes of d - brane instantons arising in intersecting brane models can generate effective interactions at energies that are not linked to the gauge theory scale , and for this reason they are usually called `` stringy '' or `` exotic '' instantons .",
    "this feature is very welcome in the search of semi - realistic string scenarios for the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "it is therefore of the greatest importance to devise techniques to determine quantitatively such exotic non - perturbative corrections through their explicit realization at the string level . in this context",
    "both the usual gauge instantons and the exotic ones can be obtained from euclidean branes entirely wrapping some cycle of the internal space .",
    "depending on whether this cycle coincides or not with the one wrapped by the space - filling d - branes on which the gauge theory is defined , the euclidean branes correspond to gauge or exotic instantons , respectively .    in the simplest cases ,",
    "@xmath3 gauge instantons can be realized with bound states of space - filling d3-branes and point - like d(-1)-branes @xcite . in these systems",
    "the massless sector of open strings having at least one endpoint on the d(-1 ) s is in one - to - one correspondence with the moduli of the gauge instanton solution .",
    "actually , also the effective action on the moduli space , the rules of the instanton calculus and the profile of the classical solution can be explicitly obtained in this way @xcite .    in the exotic cases ,",
    "the gauge and instantonic branes intersect non - trivially in the internal space and thus the open strings stretching between them have extra `` twisted '' directions and some instanton moduli ( specifically those related to sizes and gauge orientations ) disappear from the spectrum .",
    "their supersymmetric fermionic partners remain massless , and when integrated out , they can lead to the effective interactions we alluded to above .",
    "a very simple example of this phenomenon occurs in the d(-1)/d7 brane system , which exhibits the world - sheet features of exotic instantons since mixed open strings have eight twisted directions . by adding o7-planes ,",
    "this system can be embedded in type i@xmath1 string theory , a setup which possesses a computable perturbative heterotic dual .",
    "the non - perturbative contributions of d - instantons to the effective action on the d7-branes can be explicitly computed as integrals over the moduli space via localization techniques , in strict analogy with what is done for usual gauge instantons @xcite .",
    "one finds that all d - instanton numbers correct the quartic gauge couplings of the @xmath4 gauge theory of the d7-branes@xcite , and this whole series of terms matches the perturbative result obtained in the dual heterotic string theory .    in this contribution",
    "we briefly describe one example of exotic instanton calculus in a @xmath3 setup that has been developed in @xcite .",
    "we consider a perturbatively conformal @xmath5 gauge theory that admits a brane realization where exotic instantons generate a whole series of corrections to the quadratic gauge couplings and possesses a calculable heterotic dual against which these corrections can be checked .",
    "this provides a very non - trivial check of the correctness of this approach to the exotic instanton calculus .",
    "we consider a @xmath7 orientifold compactification of type iib string theory on @xmath8 .",
    "the action of the orientifold generators selects 4 o7-planes located at the invariant points of @xmath9 and 64 o3-planes located at the fixed points of @xmath8 .",
    "the global cancellation of the rr tadpoles requires the presence of 16 dynamical d7-branes transverse to @xmath9 and of 16 dynamical  half  d3-branes transverse to the internal 6-torus .",
    "we choose to cancel _ locally _ the rr charges in @xmath9 by placing exactly 4 d7-branes and 4 half d3-branes on top of each o7-plane .",
    "the d3 s could then be distributed over the 16 orbifold fixed points that are common to a given o7-plane . for sake of simplicity",
    "we place them at distinct points of @xmath10 and we focus on the gauge theory leaving in one of the o7 fixed plane .",
    "the @xmath3 field theory leaving on the d7 world - volume at the selected fixed plane is a conformal @xmath11 @xmath12 sym theory containing one adjoint vector multiplet , two antisymmetric hypermultiplets and four fundamental hypermultiplets which are charged under a @xmath13 flavour group .",
    "the quadratic effective action for the gauge fields can be described by holomorphic wilsonian couplings @xcite that have the following structure : @xmath14 where the subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to the tree - level and 1-loop contributions , while the last term accounts for possibile non perturbative corrections .",
    "writing the effective action in terms of the @xmath6 multiplet encoding the @xmath12 gauge degrees of freedom , @xmath17 , we see that there are two possible colour structures , each with its own coupling : @xmath18 the tree - level value for the single trace coupling @xmath19 can be deduced from the born - infeld action and is @xmath20 on the other hand the tree level value for the double trace coupling @xmath21 is vanishing .",
    "the only perturbative corrections to @xmath19 and @xmath21 come from the 1-loop threshold corrections , which in turn are related in an universal way to the string 1-loop two point - functions .",
    "the correction to the single trace coupling @xmath22 is expected to vanish , since the gauge theory is conformal , and in fact the 1-loop string diagrams that contribute to the single trace coupling add up to zero . on the contrary ,",
    "the 1-loop diagrams that contribute to the double trace structure give a non vanishing result , due to the massless states winding on @xmath23 , and we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 is complex structure of @xmath23 .    in the next sections we will study the non - perturbative corrections @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath27 induced by d - instantons .",
    "the orientifold projection that defines our model is compatible both with euclidean e3-branes wrapped on @xmath10 that represent ordinary gauge instantons for the field theory living on the d7-branes , and d - instantons which describe truly stringy instanton configurations for the d7-brane gauge theory @xcite . here",
    "we only discuss the contributions produced by the d(-1)-branes , and show that they correct non - perturbatively the gauge kinetic functions of the @xmath7 @xmath12 theory discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : imodel ] .",
    "again we focus on the four d7-branes located at one of the orientifold fixed points , and place on them a number of fractional d - instantons",
    ". however , since there are also four d3-branes distributed in four different orbifold fixed points , we have to distinguish between two possibilities , depending on whether the d - instantons are at an empty fixed point or occupy the same position of one of the d3-branes . in the first case ( case _ a ) _ ) only the ( -1)/(-1 ) and ( -1)/7 open strings support massless moduli , because the ( -1)/3 strings have always a non - vanishing stretching energy due to the separation between their endpoints . in the second case ( case _",
    "b ) _ ) we can find massless excitations also in the spectrum of the ( -1)/3 strings .",
    "consistently with the orientifold projections , when we set @xmath28 `` half '' d - instantons at a given fixed point , the instanton moduli organize in representation of @xmath29 and in representations of the lorentz symmetry group , which in our local system is broken to @xmath30 .",
    "the ( -1)/(-1 ) moduli form the so - called neutral moduli sector , since they do not transform under the @xmath12 gauge group and are common to both case _ a ) _ and _ b)_. they comprise four complex scalars transforming as vectors of the @xmath31 groups that rotate the coordinates of the d7 world volume , a complex scalar @xmath32 and their fermionic partners .",
    "the charged moduli sector accounts for the ( -1)/7 open strings .",
    "since there are eight directions with mixed boundary conditions we only find a physical fermionic modulus @xmath33 . finally , the flavored sector of the instanton moduli space arises from the ( -1)/3 open strings . in our model",
    ", this sector exists only in case _",
    "b ) _ , when the d(-1 ) s and the d3 s occupy the same fixed point . it will be useful however to consider the generalized case with @xmath34 half d3-branes supporting a @xmath35 symmetry , so that the configuration _ a ) _ corresponds to @xmath36 and the configuration _",
    "b ) _ corresponds to @xmath37 . in this case , one finds two complex variables transforming as chiral spinors with respect to @xmath38 , and two spinors of opposite chiralities with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "all physical moduli and their transformation properties are summarized in tab .  1 .",

    "the corrections induced by d - instantons can be encoded in a non perturbative prepotential @xmath67 , which , taking into account the different instanton configurations and their multiplicity , can be written as @xmath68    the prepotentials @xmath69 can be expressed as integrals over the `` centered '' moduli space ( containing all moduli except the `` center of mass '' coordinates @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) of the instantonic branes . to compute @xmath67",
    "we exploit the fact @xcite that , after suitable deformations of the instanton action , the modular integrals localize around isolated points in the instanton moduli space . to obtain explicit formulas we first take @xmath72 , where @xmath73 are constant expectation values along the cartan directions of @xmath12 , and then consider the @xmath74-deformed instanton partition function @xmath75 where @xmath76 is obtained by deforming the moduli action with lorentz breaking terms parameterized by four parameters @xmath77 describing rotations along the four cartan directions of @xmath31 . from the string perspective , these deformations can be obtained by switching on suitable rr background fluxes on the d7-branes , as shown in @xcite .",
    "notice that integrals in ( [ ipf0 ] ) run over all moduli , including @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in presence of the @xmath74-deformations",
    "it is rather easy to see that the integration over the super - space yields a volume factor growing as @xmath78 in the limit of small @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , to obtain the integral over the centered moduli this factor has to be removed .",
    "in addition , we have to notice that the @xmath28-th order in the @xmath80-expansion receives contributions not only from genuine @xmath28-instanton configurations but also from disconnected ones .",
    "thus , we are led to consider @xmath81 the prepotential will be extracted from @xmath82 by sending @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we can choose as @xmath85 any component of the supersymmetry charges preserved on the brane system .",
    "of course , since these charges transform as spinors of @xmath31 , the choice of @xmath85 breaks this symmetry to the @xmath87 $ ] subgroup which preserves this spinor .",
    "after this identification is made we can see that all the moduli but @xmath32 form brst doublets , which we will schematically denote as @xmath88 , and the moduli action can indeed be written in the form ( [ q ] ) .    to localize the integral over moduli space ,",
    "it is necessary to make the charge @xmath85 equivariant with respect to all symmetries , which in our case are the gauge symmetry @xmath89 and the residual lorentz symmetry @xmath90 . after the equivariant deformation ,",
    "the charge @xmath85 becomes nilpotent up to an element of the symmetry group . in the basis provided by the weights @xmath91 , @xmath85 acts diagonally @xmath92 where @xmath93 , parametrize the equivariant deformation in terms of the cartan components of the group parameters @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    "considering also the perturbative contributions written above we have @xmath151    we would like to stress that the vanishing of the contributions at the one and three instanton level is due to the non - trivial cancellations between contributions coming from configurations _ a ) _ and _ b)_.",
    "the heterotic model dual to the type i@xmath1 description of the previous sections can be built from the u(16 ) compactification of the so(32 ) heterotic string on @xmath152 ( with standard embedding of the orbifold curvature into the gauge bundle ) and further reduced on @xmath9 with wilson lines that break u(16 ) to @xmath153 .",
    "the gauge kinetic terms in this heterotic set - up are corrected at 1-loop by an infinite tower of world - sheet instantons wrapping @xmath9 , which are dual to the d - instantons of the type i@xmath1 theory @xcite and read @xcite : @xmath154 these couplings are exact and do not receive any kind of corrections beyond 1-loop .",
    "therefore they must contain all information , both perturbative and non - perturbative , on the corresponding type i@xmath1 couplings , including the ( exotic ) instanton corrections computed above .",
    "indeed , when we expand for large values of @xmath155 and use the duality map that relate the khler modulus of the heterotic theory @xmath155 to the axio - dilaton @xmath156 of the type i@xmath1 model : @xmath157 , these heterotic formulas predict no instanton corrections at @xmath158 and @xmath159 , and a relative coefficient @xmath160 between the @xmath161 corrections to @xmath19 and @xmath21 , in perfect agreement with the results obtained in the type i@xmath1 setting .",
    "we regard these results as a nice and non - trivial confirmation of the validity of the exotic instanton calculus , which can then be applied with confidence also to four - dimensional theories and to models for which the heterotic dual is not known or does not exist .",
