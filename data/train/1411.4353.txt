    "in modern cosmology , it is common to realize the late time acceleration of our universe either by considering an extra energy component namely _ dark energy _ or modifying the theory of gravity .",
    "however , the two approaches are totally different in nature .",
    "discrimination of dark energy from a modified gravity theory is a crucial issue in theory and cosmic probes . at the background level these",
    "are strongly degenerated as both yield the same expansion history of our universe .",
    "but the dynamic evolution of a small perturbation would be different for different gravity theories .",
    "therefore , observations of the large scale structure of our universe may reveal some clue about the actual scenario .    for the large scale structure , one can only read the correlation of galaxies , the tracers of the distribution of halos . and",
    "usually , one uses its fourier transformation , the galaxy power spectrum @xmath9 . to understand the evolution of the matter perturbations even at the linear level",
    ", one should assume a relation between the overdensities of galaxy and matter , i.e. , @xmath10 , where the overdensity for matter @xmath11 is well understood in theory .",
    "to compare the theory and cosmic observations , the so - called bias factor @xmath12 , which usually depends on scales @xmath13 , should be understood well .",
    "this galaxy bias issue limits the use of the matter power spectrum to study the large scale structure formation of universe . for the nonlinear scale evolution ,",
    "one still needs a better understanding of the halo model .",
    "the study of the nonlinear evolution through @xmath14-body simulation code with enough resolution and scales is numerically expensive and time - consuming .",
    "thus , it is very difficult to scan model parameter space via the @xmath14-body simulation technique . in this regard ,",
    "the so - called * halofit * model @xcite is an alternative plausible choice .",
    "the above argument is based on the observations to the continuity equation for the perturbation evolution .",
    "the other best thing is related to the velocity field which comes from the second perturbation equation , the so - called euler equation . although peculiar velocities are difficult to be observed directly , if galaxies can be treated as test particles , their peculiar velocities should be directly related to the total matter distribution .",
    "actually , the galaxy maps will be distorted in the line of sight direction by peculiar velocities because of the interpretation of galaxy redshift as its distance . as a result",
    ", the overdensities in the redshift and real space are related via @xmath15 where @xmath16 is distortion factor , @xmath17 is the growth rate and @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the angle between @xmath20 and the line of sight .",
    "this is the redshift space distortion or the kaiser effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , the combination @xmath21 is independent of galaxy bias in the linear case @xcite .",
    "the redshift space distortion data are useful to constrain the cosmological parameters space @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the ten @xmath3 data points as given in table [ tab : fsigma8data ] for constraining the model parameter space .",
    ".the data points of @xmath3 measured from rsd with the survey references . [ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      c.l . , @xmath22 c.l . by using the _ planck _ 2013 , wmap9 , bao , bao , jla , hst and rsd data sets.,width=311 ]    the inclusion of rsd data set leads to very tight constraints on the model parameter @xmath7 at @xmath23 c.l .",
    "( see table [ tab : results ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fsigma8 ] , we show the sensitive dependence of @xmath3 on the model parameter @xmath24 , where one can see that the larger values of @xmath25 predict the larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "actually , it is already seen from the linear matter power spectrum as shown in figure [ fig : pks ] .",
    "this is one of the main finding of this work .",
    "when this model parameter is well constrained on the linear scale , much time can be saved in @xmath14-body simulation by specifying the values obtained from the linear matter power spectrum .     for different values of @xmath26 from the top to the bottom , where the values of other relevant cosmological model parameters were fixed to their best fit values listed in table [",
    "tab : results].,width=359 ]    now let us move to the discussion of the nonlinear matter power spectrum at redshift @xmath27 obtained from * halofit * , * mghalofit * and the fitting formula given * ppffit * in ref .",
    "@xcite where the other relevant cosmological model parameters were fixed to their best fitting values as obtained above in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "this comparison can provide clues to the difference of matter power spectrum at the nonlinear scales .",
    "we show the linear and nonlinear matter power spectrum corrected by different fitting in figure [ fig : pksfrnl ] .     for a specific family of @xmath0 model with * halofit * , * mghalofit * and gr correction * ppffit * @xcite and that for @xmath1cdm model in gr , where the values of other relevant cosmological model parameters were fixed to their best fit values listed in table [ tab : results].,title=\"fig:\",width=359 ]   for a specific family of @xmath0 model with * halofit * , * mghalofit * and gr correction * ppffit * @xcite and that for @xmath1cdm model in gr , where the values of other relevant cosmological model parameters were fixed to their best fit values listed in table [ tab : results].,title=\"fig:\",width=359 ]    the top curve in figure [ fig : pksfrnl ] shows the relative difference of linear matter power spectrum between @xmath0 and @xmath1cdm .",
    "this difference is due to the modification of the newtonian constant @xmath28 , that has been understood very well in ref .",
    "@xcite . the second curve in figure [ fig : pksfrnl ] on the right side from the top",
    "was obtained from the standard * halofit * formula . that predicts relative large nonlinear matter power spectrum . the third curve in figure [ fig : pksfrnl ] on the right side from the top",
    "shows the relative difference of the nonleianr matter power spectrum corrected by gr nonlinear power spectrum from standard * halofit * model via the * ppffit * @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the power spectrum in @xmath1cdm model and @xmath31 is given by @xmath32^{1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the linear matter power spectrum in @xmath0 gravity and @xmath34 is the nonlinear power spectrum in @xmath0 gravity without gr correction .",
    "actually it is unknown priorly and the final nonlinear power spectrum what we are pursuing .",
    "therefore , the linear matter power spectrum in a @xmath0 gravity corrected by the standard * halofit * model is taken as a substitute",
    ". one can also find this kind of correction in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 were adopted for the case of @xmath38 at the redshift @xmath27 , because the values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the case of @xmath42 at the redshift @xmath27 are still unavailable now .",
    "therefore , we should keep in mind that different values of values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath41 will change the shape and amplitude of the matter power spectrum at the nonlinear scale . to understand the changes",
    ", we plotted the nonlinear matter power spectrum with combination of different values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath41 in figure [ fig : pkshefitt ] .",
    "the larger values of @xmath43 will decrease the matter spectrum at the region larger than @xmath45 .",
    "the larger values of @xmath44 will increase the matter spectrum at the region larger than @xmath46 .",
    "the larger values of @xmath41 will decrease the matter spectrum at the region larger than @xmath45 . then choosing a combination carefully",
    ", a corrected power spectrum can mimic the evolution of the nonlinear matter power spectrum fitted from the * mghalofit * model or * halofit * model in @xmath1cdm model at a given redshift , say @xmath27 .",
    "however , it is still hard to model the dependence of the model parameter @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath41 to @xmath24 at different redshifts @xcite .",
    "the * mghalofit * works in the range @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 , it is free from this kind of difficulties . as a comparison to the naive * halofit * and gr correction model , * mghalofit * predicts relative small deviation to the @xmath1cdm model based on * halofit*. one should worry about the suitability of * mghalofit * for this specific family of @xmath0 models , because * mghalofit * is obtained based on hu - sawicki model @xcite , but for this tiny @xmath49 , it is difficult to detect a model not only because of the accuracy of the fitting formula but also because of the complicated astrophysical systematics on such scales @xcite . based on these points , * mghalofit * would be a better choice .     for combinations of different values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where the values of other relevant cosmological model parameters were fixed to their best fit values listed in table [ tab : results].,width=359 ]",
    "in this paper , a specific family of @xmath0 models which can produce the @xmath1cdm background expansion history has been tightly constrained with an addition of the redshift space distortion data @xmath3 combing the other cosmic observations which include sn , bao , cmb and hst . considering the scale dependence of the growth rate @xmath50 for this this specific @xmath0 model , we use the alternative definition @xmath5 in theory calculation , that is obviously scale independent and reproduces the conventional definition in the standard @xmath1cdm cosmology . in doing so , under the assumption that future probes having the same best fit values as the current ten data points of @xmath3 , even having @xmath6 error bars enlarged , we find a preliminary constraint @xmath7 in @xmath8 regions .",
    "this indicates the great potential that redshift space distortions have in constraining modified gravity theories .",
    "we have analyzed the nonlinear matter power spectrum at redshift @xmath27 in the specific family of @xmath0 models using three fitting methods for the best fit values of model parameters .",
    "the first one is the standard * halofit * model , where the matter power spectrum deviates from the @xmath1cdm about @xmath6 at the nonlinear scales .",
    "the second is the * ppffit * method which is based on the * halofit * model with a correction from the @xmath1cdm model nonlinear power spectrum . at a fixed redshift",
    "say @xmath27 , in principle , by carefully choosing values of model parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath41 , almost the same nonlinear matter power spectrum as of @xmath1cdm model can be produced , but it is hard to model the dependence of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath41 on @xmath24 at different redshifts .",
    "the third one is * mghalofit * model , although it is modeled based on hu - sawicki model and works in the range of @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath48 , the resultant nonlinear matter power spectrum can almost mimic the @xmath1cdm model with very small deviation from @xmath1cdm model .",
    "also the dependence to the parameter @xmath24 is well modeled .",
    "based on this point , * mghalofit * would be a better choice , although it is based on the analysis of hu - sawicki model . with the very small values of @xmath24 ,",
    "it is difficult to detect a model not only because of the accuracy of the fitting formula but also the complicated astrophysical systematics on such scales @xcite .",
