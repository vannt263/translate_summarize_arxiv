    "twenty seven galactic and magellanic x - ray sources are thought to constitute a class of objects called magnetars , which are single neutron stars ( nss ) with extremely strong magnetic fields of @xmath1  g. they are believed to shine ( mainly in x - rays ) consuming the energies in their strong magnetic fields , because their x - ray luminosities exceed their spin - down luminosities and they are not likely to be accreting objects .",
    "the magnetar concept well explains other peculiar characteristics of these objects , such as long pulse periods clustered in a narrow range ( @xmath2  s ) , relatively large period derivatives , and unpredictable sporadic burst activities .",
    "however , we do not know yet how they are formed and how such strong fields evolved .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) associated with magnetars are expected to provide us with valuable clues to the scenario of magnetar production ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the study of snr / ns associations ( e.g. , @xcite ) has been re - activated since the concept of magnetar has emerged .",
    "although no clear difference in the explosion energy has yet been found between snrs with and without magnetars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , an x - ray metallicity study of the snr kes  73 , hosting the magnetar 1e  1841 - 045 , led @xcite to infer that the progenitor of this system had a mass of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the solar mass . through investigations of several snr / magnetar associations",
    ", @xcite characterized environments that are responsible for the magnetar production , and reinforced the view of rather massive progenitors .",
    "apart from the progenitor issue , one particularly interesting aspect of magnetars , which can be studied by simultaneously considering the associated snrs , is their age comparison .",
    "of course , as discussed by @xcite , the ages of a magnetar and of the associated snr , estimated independently , must agree for them to be regarded as a true association .",
    "however , these two age estimations sometimes disagree even in pairs with very good positional coincidence , including the 1e 2259 + 586/ctb  109 pair which is the topic of the present paper .",
    "this is often called `` age problem '' . while @xcite suspected that the problem arises because an snr age estimate is affected by the presence of a magnetar",
    ", @xcite instead attributed it to magnetic field decay of magnetars , which can make their characteristic ages much longer than their true ages .",
    "after the discovery of sgr 0418 + 5729 @xcite , a magnetar with a low dipole magnetic field , the field s decay scenario has become more attractive @xcite .    through x - ray studies of ctb 109 , the present paper attempts to address two issues .",
    "one is to solve the age problem with the 1e  2259 + 586/ctb  109 system , and the other is to conversely utilize the result to reinforce the nature of magnetars as magnetically driven nss . after a brief introduction to the target system ( section [ sec:1e2259ctb109 ] ) ,",
    "we describe in section  [ sec : obs ] and section  [ sec : dataana ] recent suzaku observations of ctb  109 , and reconfirm the age problem in the system ( section [ sec : ageestimation ] ) .",
    "then , an attempt is made in section  [ sec : solveage ] to solve it invoking the decay of magnetic fields . finally , we discuss some implications for the general view of nss , including in particular their magnetic evolution .",
    "other topics will be discussed elsewhere , including more detailed x - ray diagnostics of ctb 109 , the origin of its peculiar half - moon shape , and characterization of the progenitor .",
    "the galactic snr , ctb  109 , hosting the central point x - ray source 1e  2259 + 586 , was first discovered by the einstein observatory @xcite as an extended x - ray source with a peculiar semi - circular shape .",
    "it was independently identified as a shell - type snr by radio observations at 610 mhz @xcite . a 10  ghz radio map taken with the nobeyama radio observatory revealed good positional coincidence between the radio and x - ray shells , while detected no significant enhancement from 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite .",
    "through co molecular line observations , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite found a giant molecular cloud located next to ctb  109 , and suggested that it may have disturbed the snr on the west side .",
    "@xcite conducted a comprehensive x - ray study of this snr with xmm - newton . assuming a distance of @xmath5  kpc @xcite , they estimated the shock velocity , age , and the explosion energy as @xmath6 km s@xmath7 , 8.8 kyr , and @xmath8 erg respectively .",
    "strong evidence for an interaction between the snr shock front and the co cloud was found by using @xmath9co , @xmath10co and chandra observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , gamma - ray emission was detected with the fermi - lat from ctb  109 @xcite . finally , using chandra , @xcite detected emission from the ejecta component and refined the age as 14  kyr .",
    "the compact object 1e  2259 + 586 was first detected in x - rays nearly at the center of ctb  109 @xcite .",
    "it was soon found to be a pulsar , and the pulse period was at first considered as @xmath11  s @xcite .",
    "this was due to the double - peaked pulse profile , and the fundamental period was soon revised to @xmath12  s @xcite .",
    "repeated x - ray observations enabled the spin down rate to be measured as @xmath13 @xcite , and these results made it clear that the spin - down luminosity of 1e  2259 + 586 ( @xmath14  erg  s@xmath7 ) is far insufficient to explain its x - ray luminosity , @xmath15  erg  s@xmath7 . due to this and the long pulse period , 1e  2259 + 586 was long thought to be an x - ray binary with an orbital period of @xmath16  s ( e.g. @xcite ) , and extensive search for a counterpart continued @xcite .",
    "however , no counterpart was found @xcite , and instead , tight upper limits on the orbital doppler - modulation have been obtained as @xmath17 light - s @xcite , @xmath18 light - s @xcite , and @xmath19 light - s @xcite . here , @xmath20 is the semi - major axis of the pulsar s orbit , and @xmath21 is the orbital inclination .",
    "these strange properties of 1e  2259 + 586 led this and a few other similar objects to be called anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) .    in the 1990 s , several attempts were made to explain 1e  2259 + 586 without invoking a companion : e.g. , massive white dwarf model @xcite , and precessing white dwarf model @xcite .",
    "monthly observations of 1e  2259 + 596 over 2.6 years with rxte gave phase - coherent timing solutions indicating a strong stability over that period @xcite .",
    "this favored non - accretion interpretation .",
    "@xcite suggested that spin - down irregularities of axps are statistically similar to glitches of radio pulsars .",
    "meanwhile , the concept of magnetar was proposed to explain soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) as magnetically - powered nss , namely , magnetars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , like sgrs , 1e  2259 + 586 showed an x - ray outburst @xcite .",
    "today , axps including 1e  2259 + 586 , as well as sgrs , are both considered to be magnetars .",
    "employing the canonical assumption of spin down due to magnetic dipole radiation , the measured pulse period of @xmath12  s @xcite , and its derivative , @xmath22ss@xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , give a dipole magnetic field of @xmath23  g and a characteristic age of @xmath24230  kyr .",
    "the suzaku observations of 1e  2259 + 586 and ctb  109 were made on two occasions .",
    "the first of them was conducted on 2009 may 25 as a part of the ao4 key project on magnetars @xcite .",
    "the three cameras ( xis0 , xis1 , and xis3 ) of the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) onboard suzaku were operated in 1/4-window mode with a time resolution of 2  s @xcite , to study the 6.98  s pulsation .",
    "the rectangular @xmath25 fields of view of the 1/4-window were center on this magnetar , while the snr was partially covered .",
    "as the second observation , we performed new four pointings onto ctb  109 with suzaku ( pi : t.nakano ) on 2011 december 13 . in order to synthesize a whole image of the snr , all xis cameras were operated in full - window mode under the sacrifice of time resolution .",
    "a log of these observations is given in table [ tb : observationtable ] .",
    "in the present work , we use the xis data which were prepared with version 2.7.16.31 pipeline proceeding , and the calibration data updated in january 2013 .",
    "the data of the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) from neither observation are utilized here , since the suzaku data analysis in the present paper focuses on ctb  109 , rather than the central magnetar .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using the headas software package version 6.13 , and spectral fitting was performed with xspec version 12.8.0 .",
    "the redistribution matrix files and the auxiliary response files of the xis were generated with xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen @xcite respectively .    .",
    "log of suzaku observations of ctb  109 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tb : observationtable ]",
    "figure [ fig : xisimage ] shows a gray - scale mosaic image of ctb  109 obtained with the suzaku xis , shown after subtracting non x - ray background .",
    "the magnetar , 1e  2259 + 586 , appears as a bright source at the center .",
    "the crisscross region including 1e  2259 + 586 was taken in the first observation , while four square regions represent those from the second one .",
    "thus , the mosaic xis image reconfirms the half - moon like morphology of this snr ( section[sec : ctb109 ] ) .    as mentioned in section [ sec : ctb109 ] , the lack of western part of ctb 109 is usually attributed to its interactions with giant molecular clouds .",
    "bright regions in the snr are also thought to be the signature of such an interaction @xcite .",
    "these issues , together with detailed spatial distributions of x - ray spectral properties , will be postponed to another publication .",
    "the present paper instead deals with average x - ray spectra , because our prime motivation is to estimate the age of ctb  109 .",
    "figure [ fig : spect ] shows xis0 , xis1 and xis3 spectra of ctb  109 from the second observation , extracted from the regions indicated in figure [ fig : xisimage ] as `` ne '' and `` se '' , which represent two eastern pointing positions . since these eastern parts of the snr has kept smooth round shape , the effect from the interaction with gmc seems to be small .",
    "background spectra were extracted from source free regions in the same observation which are also indicated as `` bgd '' in figure [ fig : xisimage ] .",
    "spectral bins were summed up to attain a minimum of 30 counts bin@xmath7 .",
    "the `` ne '' and `` se '' spectra are very similar and both exhibit emission lines due to highly ionized atoms such as ne - ix triplet ( @xmath00.92  kev ) , ne - x ly@xmath26 ( 1.02  kev ) , mg - xi triplet ( @xmath01.35  kev ) , si - xiii triplet ( @xmath01.87  kev ) , and s - xv triplet ( @xmath02.45  kev ) .",
    "we first applied a variable - abundance non - equilibrium ionization  ( vnei ) plasma emission model to the ne spectra in figure [ fig : spect ] ( a ) .",
    "however , even when abundances of ne , mg , si and s are allowed to vary freely , the reduced @xmath27 of the fit was not made lower than 1.5 .",
    "thus , the single temperature vnei model was rejected .",
    "other plasma models in xspec , such as vpshock and vmekal were also unsuccessful .",
    "then , we considered that the snr emission consists of two components including ejecta and shocked inter - stellar medium ( ism ) , and added a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plasma emission model to model shocked ism component .",
    "abundances of ism component was fixed to solar to reduce the number of free parameters .    by introducing this two - component emission model ,",
    "the fit was improved to @xmath281.28 .",
    "since different xis cameras gave discrepant fit residuals around mg - xi k@xmath26 and si - xiii k@xmath26 lines , presumably due to calibration uncertainties of the xis , we allowed gain parameters of the xis cameras to vary .",
    "then , the fit has become acceptable with @xmath29 = 1.06 ( 1293/1223 ) .",
    "the obtained best - fit parameters are shown in table [ tab : parameters ] , while the gain parameters in table [ tab : gainparameters ] .",
    "since the obtained abundances of the second ( plasma  2 ) component are all consistent with 1 solar , it is also likely to be dominated by the ism .",
    "the two components are both inferred to be somewhat deviated from ionization equilibrium .",
    "the fit was not improved even when the abundance of the plasma  2 component is allowed to change from 1.0 .",
    "similarly , we analyzed the se spectra shown in figure [ fig : spect ] ( b ) , and derived the parameters which are again summarized in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "thus , the two temperatures are in good agreement between the two regions , although the se region gives somewhat higher metal abundances .",

    "now that the average plasma properties of ctb  109 have been quantified , let us proceed to our prime goal of studying this snr , i.e. , its age estimation .",
    "first , the physical radius of ctb  109 is estimated as @xmath76   pc , from its angular size of @xmath77 and the estimated distance @xmath78  kpc @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath79 is scale factor of distance .",
    "next , ctb  109 may be considered in the sedov phase ( neglecting the missing western part ) .",
    "then , applying the sedov - taylor similarity solution @xcite to this snr , its age can be obtained as @xmath80 where @xmath81 again represents the shock front velocity .    assuming the strong shock limit",
    ", we can calculate @xmath81 from the post - shock temperature @xmath82 as @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively represent the boltzmann constant and the mean mass per free particle . assuming a solar abundance ( section  [ subsec : spect ] )",
    ", we employed @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the proton mass .",
    "since ctb  109 is a middle - aged snr without too strong shocks , the electron temperature of the nei component measured in section [ sec : dataana ] can be considered to be close to the kinematic ism temperature , and hence to @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "thus , substituting @xmath88  kev for @xmath82 , equation ( 2 ) gives @xmath89  km  s@xmath7 , and then equation ( 1 ) yields @xmath90  kyr in agreement with @xcite .",
    "compared to the estimated @xmath91 , the characteristic age of 1e  2259 + 586 , @xmath92  kyr ( section  [ sec:1e2259 ] ) , is @xmath016 times larger .",
    "if we assume that ctb  109 is in cooling phase rather than sedov phase , the time dependence of the radius becomes @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "then , the age estimation slightly changes to @xmath94 and @xmath95  kyr is obtained .",
    "therefore the age discrepancy still persists ( even increases ) .",
    "let us cross - check the above estimates using the parameter @xmath96 ( table [ tab : parameters ] ) of the ejecta component .",
    "we assume that the snr has a half spherical shell with thickness of @xmath97 ( assuming @xmath98 ) , and the ism component corresponding to plasma  2 in table [ tab : parameters ] is emitted from this shell . furthermore , as a simplest approximation",
    ", the ejecta component ( plasma  1 in table [ tab : parameters ] ) may be assumed to uniformly fill the inner region , considering that the reverse shock has reached the center of the snr . in the ne region ,",
    "the extracted emission volumes of plasma  1(ejecta ) and plasma  2(ism ) can be obtained numerically as @xmath99  @xmath100 and @xmath101  @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "then , the spectrum normalizations in table [ tab : parameters ] give the averaged density of the ejecta as @xmath102  @xmath103 and that of the ism - shell as @xmath104  @xmath103 . the time required for the ejecta to become ionized as we now observe",
    "is hence estimated as @xmath105  kyr . applying the same argument to the se region having the emission volumes of @xmath106  @xmath100 and @xmath107  @xmath100",
    ", we obtain @xmath108  @xmath103 and @xmath109  @xmath103 , and @xmath110  kyr .",
    "pre - shock density is estimated as @xmath111  @xmath103 .",
    "even though these estimates of @xmath91 must have a certain range of systematic uncertainties , large discrepancies significantly remain between @xmath91 and @xmath112 .",
    "in fact , it would be difficult to think that ctb  109 are emitting x - rays even at an age of  230  kyr while keeping the regular shape ( except the missing western half ) , because its density environment as estimated is quite typical of a solar neighborhood .",
    "thus , we reconfirm the previously reported age discrepancy @xcite between ctb  109 and 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "the magnetar 1e  2259 + 586 is located nearly at the very center of the half - moon - shaped shell of ctb  109 ( section  [ sub : imageana ] , figure [ fig : xisimage ] ) .",
    "this coincidence is difficult to explain by invoking a chance superposition of the two objects .",
    "we therefore assume that 1e  2259 + 586 and ctb  109 were indeed produced by the same supernova explosion ( section [ sec : magsnr ] ) , while @xmath113 of 1e  2259 + 586 is somehow significantly overestimated , compared to its true age which we consider to be close to @xmath91 .      to solve the issue of the suggested overestimate of @xmath113 after @xcite and @xcite , let us begin with reviewing the meaning of @xmath113 .",
    "in general , the spin evolution of a pulsar with dipole surface magnetic field @xmath114 is expressed empirically as @xmath115 with @xmath116 and the braking index of @xmath117 , where @xmath118 km is the pulsar s radius , @xmath119 its momentum of inertia , @xmath120 vacuum permeability and @xmath121 the light velocity .",
    "if we use the pulse period @xmath122 and its derivative @xmath123 instead of @xmath124 and @xmath125 , equation ( [ eq : domega / dt ] ) becomes @xmath126 if @xmath114 does not depend on time @xmath127 , equation ( [ eq : domega / dt ] ) can be integrated as @xmath128           = \\tau_\\mathrm{c}\\left [   1 - \\left ( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{0 } } \\right)^{n-1 } \\right ]          \\label{eq : eqb1}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 and @xmath125 both refer to the present values , while @xmath129 is the angular frequency at @xmath130 ( i.e. the birth ) . assuming that @xmath131 can be neglected , the characteristic age is defined as @xmath132 these equations are generally used for pulsars , and found in some textbooks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , the true age of the pulsar , denoted by @xmath133 , can be compared with its @xmath113 as @xmath134 where @xmath135 , and the last expression is the first - order approximation in @xmath136 .",
    "thus , @xmath113 becomes somewhat larger than @xmath133 if @xmath137 can not be neglected .",
    "conversely , if we somehow have an independent estimate of @xmath133 its comparison with @xmath113 can be used to infer @xmath138 as @xmath139 for example , the crab pulsar @xcite , with @xmath140 ms , @xmath141 and @xmath142 = 2.509 @xcite , has @xmath143  yr . comparing this with its true age of @xmath144 ( as of 2014 ) ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : eqb3 ] ) yields @xmath145 if assuming @xmath146 , on @xmath147 if @xmath148 ( for ideal magnetic dipole radiation ) .",
    "thus , regardless of the employed value of @xmath142 , the small difference between @xmath113 and @xmath133 of the crab pulsar can be understood to imply that it has so far lost @xmath149 of its initial rotational energy in @xmath150 .",
    "in contrast to the above case of young active pulsars , we would need to invoke @xmath151 s , if equation ( 9 ) with @xmath117 were used to explain the large discrepancy , @xmath152 , found in the ctb/1e2259 + 586 system .",
    "this would lead to a view that 1e  2259 + 586 was born some 14  kyr ago as a slow rotator of which the spin period is much longer than those ( 0.2  s to 2  s ) of the majority of _ currently _ observed ( hence relatively old ) radio pulsars , and has so far lost only a tiny fraction of its rotational energy in 14  kyr .",
    "however , such a view is opposite to a general consensus that new - born magnetars must be rotating rapidly , even faster than ordinary pulsars , in order for them to acquire the strong magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , an ns with @xmath153 s , has an angular momentum of only @xmath154 of those of typical new - born pulsars with @xmath155 ms including the crab pulsar , and hence would require an extreme fine tuning in the progenitor - to - ns angular momentum transfer during the explosion .",
    "we therefore conclude that the age problem of 1e2259 + 586 can not be solved as long as its magnetic field is assumed to have been constant since its birth .      since the age problem of 1e  2259 + 586/ctb  109 can not be solved as long as @xmath114 is considered constant",
    ", we may next examine the case where @xmath114 decays with time ( section [ sec : magsnr ] ) .",
    "in fact , the x - ray emission of magnetar is thought to arise when their magnetic energies are consumed @xcite .",
    "then , the calculations presented in section 5.1 would be no longer valid , and we need to integrate equation ( [ eq : eqb1 ] ) considering the time evolution of @xmath114 .",
    "let us consider a simple magnetic filed decay model employed by @xcite , namely @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a parameter , and @xmath158 is another positive constant .",
    "this equation can be solved as @xmath159 where @xmath160 represents the initial value of @xmath114 , and @xmath161 , an arbitrary constant , means a typical lead time till the power - law like decay of @xmath114 begins .",
    "substituting equation ( [ eq : b(t ) ] ) into equation ( [ eq : domega / dt ] ) , we can derive @xmath162 as a function of @xmath127 .",

    "this is because the broad - band x - ray spectra of magnetars are determined rather uniquely by @xmath113 @xcite , so that @xmath113 is considered to be tightly related to @xmath133 even if these two are unlikely to be identical : object - to - object scatter in @xmath26 would cause a scatter in the @xmath174 ratio , and would make the relation of @xcite difficult to interpret",
    ".    when @xmath26 is small ( @xmath175 ) , the field would decay , as seen in equation ( 10 ) , either exponentially ( if @xmath176 ) on a time scale of @xmath177 , or if @xmath178 , with a relatively steep power - law after a long lead time @xmath179 .",
    "the required initial field , @xmath180 g , is reasonable .",
    "however , the implied view would be rather ad - hoc : 1e 2259 + 586 had been relatively inactive until recently , when it suddenly started to release its magnetic energy with a high rate .",
    "furthermore , if such a small value of @xmath26 were common to magnetars , their age differences would make , as in figure 3 ( a ) , their present - day field distribution scatter much more widely than is observed .",
    "hence we regard these small values of @xmath26 unlikely .",
    "as @xmath26 increases towards 2.0 , the power - law field decay becomes milder , with shorter values of @xmath177 and stronger initial fields @xmath160 .",
    "the implication is that the object started releasing its magnetic energy rather soon after the birth , and had already dumped away a large fraction of its rotational energy at a very early stage when the field was still very strong . as seen in figure 3 ( c ) , the spin period has almost converged to its terminal value ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , this case can explain the observed narrow scatter in @xmath162 of magnetars , assuming that they share relatively similar values of @xmath26 and @xmath160 .",
    "however , the cases with @xmath181 or larger would require too strong initial fields , e.g. , @xmath182 g , which would be much higher than the strongest dipole field observed from magnetars , @xmath183  g of sgr  1806@xmath18420 ( nakagawa et al .",
    ". therefore , such large-@xmath26 solutions are unlikely , too . to summarize these examinations , figure 3 ( e )",
    "shows the locus of the allowed solutions on the @xmath185 plane , where the values of @xmath160 are also indicated .",
    "we thus reconfirm the above considerations , that the range of @xmath186 is appropriate , in agreement with the suggestion by @xcite .",
    "some discussions follow in subsection [ subsec : cwoo ] .    ) and equation ( [ eq : db / dt ] ) .",
    "panels ( a)-(d ) represent the behavior of the magnetic field @xmath114 , the over - estimation factor of the characteristic age ( i.e. , @xmath174 ) , the pulse period @xmath162 , and its time derivative @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "the six representative tracks are all constrained to reproduce the presently measured @xmath162 and @xmath123 at @xmath187  kyr . the dashed and dotted ones assume @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively , while the other five all @xmath190 .",
    "panel ( e ) shows the trajectory of solutions that can explain the present - day ( @xmath187  kyr ) 1e  2259 + 586 .",

    ", width=624 ]",
    "we reconfirmed the age problem of 1e  2259 + 586 and ctb  109 , and presented a way to solve it with a simple magnetic field decay model .",
    "the result agrees with the basic concept of magnetar hypothesis which implies that the energies stored by their magnetic fields should be consumed to supply their x - ray luminosities exceeding those available with their spin down .",
    "the amount of released field energies can be reflected in the overestimations of the characteristic ages .",
    "let us then examine whether this concept applies to other ns / snr associations , including both magnetars and ordinary pulsars .",
    "figure [ fig : snragevspsrage ] shows relations between @xmath113 of such single pulsars and the ages of their host snrs .",
    "data points of ordinary pulsars are distributed around the line representing @xmath191 with a few exceptions ( e.g. , @xcite for j1811@xmath1841925/g11.2@xmath1840.3 ) .",
    "therefore , radio pulsars , including the particular case of the crab pulsar ( section [ subsec : constb ] ) , are considered to be free from the age problem .",
    "in addition to the ordinary pulsars , figure [ fig : snragevspsrage ] shows a few other magnetar / snr associations . the magnetar cxou j171405.7 - 381031 has a very small characteristic age of 0.96  kyr @xcite , which is consistent , within rather large errors , with the age ( @xmath192  kyr ; @xcite ) the associated snr , ctb  37b .",
    "another magnetar / snr association , 1e  1841 - 045/kes73 , is located in figure [ fig : snragevspsrage ] between j171405.7 - 381031/ctb  37b and 1e  2259 + 586/ctb  109 .",
    "the age of kes73 was estimated by @xcite , as @xmath193 ( table [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "combining this with @xmath194 of 1e  1841 - 045 ( table [ tab : parameters ] ) , the age discrepancy of this pair becomes @xmath195 .",
    "these two associations do not show large overestimation factors of @xmath196 as much as 1e  2259 + 586/ctb  109 association .",
    "thus , the three magnetar / snr associations ( including 1e  2259 + 586/ctb  109 ) suggest that the age over - estimation factor , @xmath196 , increases towards older objects .",
    "this agrees , at least qualitatively , with the theoretical behavior seen in figure [ fig : spinmag ] ( c ) , as long as @xmath197 is negligible .",
    "we hence tried to explain the data points of these three magnetar / snr associations with a common set of parameters , and derive a plausible range of @xmath26 . for this purpose , three evolution tracks representing the solutions to equation ( [ eq : tauc ] ) for 1e  12259 + 586/ctb  109",
    "are additionally plotted on figure [ fig : snragevspsrage ] .",
    "each parameter set is the same as that of figure [ fig : spinmag](f ) . if @xmath26 is small as @xmath198 ( dashed red line ) , the cxou  j171405.7 - 381031/ctb  37b association can not be explained . on the other hand , large value of @xmath199",
    "fail to explain the 1e  1841 - 045/kes73 association .",
    "thus , the three magnetar / snr pairs in figure [ fig : snragevspsrage ] can be explained in a unified way if they have a common value of @xmath26 ( and also of @xmath163 ) that is in the range of @xmath200 .     and",
    "@xmath113 of single nss associated with snrs .",
    "red , magenta and blue represent magnetars , high - b pulsars and rotation powered pulsars , respectively .",
    "parameters are listed in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the sgr  0501 + 4516/g160.9 + 2.6 pair is parenthesized , because the association is rather doubtful , and this snr might be associated to another pulsar psr b0458 + 46 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the red , green , and blue dashed curves indicate solutions to equation ( [ eq : tauc ] ) , with @xmath201 ( 0.6 , @xmath202  yr , @xmath203  g ) , ( 1.0 , @xmath204  yr , @xmath205  g ) and ( 1.4 , @xmath206  yr , @xmath207  g ) , respectively .",
    "they all assume @xmath208  ms , and @xmath160 which is specified by figure [ fig : spinmag ] ( e ) .",
    ", width=384 ]      the scenario so far developed implies that magnetars form a population that is much younger than previously thought .",
    "this important inference is supported by an independent piece of evidence .",
    "figure [ fig : galacticdistribution ] shows a spatial distribution of nss including magnetars . because of steady motions after kick velocities are given by explosions , older pulsars with larger @xmath113 are thus distributed up to farther distances from the galactic plane .",
    "in contrast , magnetars are much more concentrated to the plane for their nominal age , as better seen in figure [ fig : galacticdistribution ] ( b ) which is a projection of figure [ fig : galacticdistribution ] ( a ) along the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "this implies two possible scenarios ; magnetars , as we have shown , are much younger than indicated by their @xmath113 , or their kick velocities are systematically lower than those of others .",
    "recently , proper motions of four magnetars ( sgr  1806@xmath18420 , sgr  1900 + 14 , 1e  2259 + 586 and 4u  0142 + 61 ) were successfully measured by @xcite .",
    "they calculated the mean and standard deviation of their ejection velocities as @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively .",
    "they also conclude that the weighted average velocity of magnetars is in good agreement with the tangential velocities of the pulsar population @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are left with the former of the two possibilities . in other words",
    ", magnetars should be systematically younger than ordinary pulsars that have similar @xmath113 .",
    "observationally , magnetars are no longer a minority of ns species .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : galacticdistribution ] ( c ) , which is the projection of figure [ fig : galacticdistribution ] ( a ) onto the time axis .",
    "thus , even if @xmath113 is not corrected for the over estimation , magnetars already occupy a considerable fraction of young nss .",
    "if we replace @xmath113 of magnetars with their true ages , their dominance among young nss will become even more enhanced .",
    "as yet another important implication , we expect that numerous aged magnetar descendants would lurk in our galaxy .",
    "radio pulsars , observed as the major population of nss , can not harbor such aged magnetars , because their @xmath162 are shorter than those of magnetars .",
    "instead , such objects may be being discovered as weak - field sgrs , including sgr  0418 + 5729 @xcite , swift  j1822.31606 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and 3xmm j185246.6 + 003317 @xcite .",
    "we performed 4 pointings observations of ctb  109 with suzaku .",
    "the spectra extracted from eastern parts of the snr were well fitted with two plasma components having two different temperatures .",
    "assuming thermal equilibrium between electrons and protons , the shock velocity was calculated as @xmath211 , and the age of the snr was estimated as @xmath212 using the sedov - similarity solution .",
    "these results are consistent with the conclusion of the previous work by @xcite .",
    "we thus reconfirmed the huge discrepancy between the age of ctb  109 and the characteristic age of 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "we consider that the characteristic age of 1e 2259 + 586 is significantly overestimated , as compared to its true age which we identify with that of ctb109 .",
    "this effect , seen also in some other magnetars to a lesser extent , can be attributed to decay of their magnetic fields , as implied by the basic concept of  magnetars \" .",
    "in fact , the observed pulse period and its derivative of 1e 2259 + 586 has been explained successfully by a family of solutions to a simple equation describing the magnetic field decay .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath113 vs @xmath91 relations of the three magnetar - snr associations , including the 1e  2259 + 586/ctb  109 pair , can be explained consistently if they have a common value of @xmath26 in the range of 0.6 - 1.4 . as a result",
    ", magnetars are considered to be much younger than was considered so far , and are rather dominant among new - born nss .",
    "the youth of magnetars is supported independently by their much stronger concentration along the galactic plane than ordinary pulsars .",

    "<S> this reconfirms the previously reported age discrepancy of this magnetar / remnant association , and suggests that the characteristic ages of magnetars are generally over - estimated as compared to their true ages . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is thought to arise because the former are calculated without considering decay of the magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> this novel view is supported independently by much stronger galactic - plane concentration of magnetars than other pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> the process of magnetic field decay in magnetars is mathematically modeled . </S>",
    "<S> it is implied that magnetars are much younger objects than previously considered , and can dominate new - born neutron stars . </S>"
