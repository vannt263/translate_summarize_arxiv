    "in this section we describe how the hamiltonian is diagonalized , subsequently how one obtains the fermionic correlation functions and from them the spin correlations functions that are analyzed in the main manuscript .      despite the presence of three - body interactions the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] )",
