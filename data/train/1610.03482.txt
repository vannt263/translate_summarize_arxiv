    "discovery of high-@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) quasars demonstrated that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) have already existed in the universe with its age less than @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this poses a question about the mechanism to form such massive objects in such a short interval . among the scenarios for the smbh seed formation",
    "proposed so far ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , such as the dense stellar cluster scenario ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) , following two are most studied ones : the direct collapse bh ( dcbh ) and the population iii ( pop iii ) remnant bh scenarios",
    ".    in the dcbh scenario , a supermassive star of @xmath4 first forms and then collapses to a bh with approximately the same mass , which will be a seed for the smbh .",
    "specifically , a supermassive star is envisaged to form in an exceptional environment in high-@xmath1 universe , for example , in an atomic - cooling halo where the @xmath5 cooling is totally suppressed due to very strong far ultraviolet irradiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the seed bhs in this case are rather massive with @xmath4 , due to the stringent environmental condition their number density might be too small to explain all the observed high-@xmath1 smbhs @xcite .    in the latter scenario ,",
    "the remnant bhs of pop iii stars @xcite will be smbh seeds @xcite . since they are more abundant , the bottle neck of this scenario is whether they can actually grow to the smbhs from the initial mass of @xmath6 @xcite within the time available .",
    "although bhs can also acquire the mass by collision with other bhs , the bh collision often results in ejection of the merged bh from the host halo due to the recoil of gravitational wave emission .",
    "thus , the feasibility of pop iii remnant scenario relies on whether the rapid accretion onto the pop iii remnants is possible or not @xcite .",
    "recently , the efficiency of gas accretion onto bhs under radiation feedback has been studied by some authors @xcite .",
    "they solve the large - scale dynamics of the gas on the scale of the bondi radius , where the accretion rate onto the bh - disk system is physically determined , considering a subgrid model for the radiation emitted from the circum - bh disk .",
    "they have shown that the accretion rate is significantly suppressed by the radiation feedback to @xmath7 of that without radiation feedback ( i.e. , the bondi rate ) in case with modest bh mass and ambient gas density ( e.g. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ) , although in case with very high bh mass and/or ambient gas density ( e.g. , @xmath10 and @xmath9 , respectively ) @xcite have shown very recently that the radiation feedback becomes inefficient and the accretion rate goes back to the bondi one ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for other mechanisms of efficient accretion ) .",
    "all those calculations have adopted the assumption of isotropic radiation ( in either one- or two - dimensional simulations ) .",
    "however , the emitted radiation from the bh accretion disk should be anisotropic in reality .",
    "in such a setting , the flow structure would be significantly altered .",
    "although the bh accretion under anisotropic radiation has been studied in the context of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with the bh mass @xmath11 @xcite , the nature of accretion onto the pop iii remnant bhs with the much smaller bh mass would be quite different .    on smaller scales , accretion disks form around the bhs and emit strong radiation .",
    "studies on the accretion disks have long history . the so - called `` standard disk '' model with a moderate accretion rate",
    "was established in @xcite .",
    "this theoretical framework was later extended to the slim - disk model with a higher accretion rate by @xcite .",
    "recently , multi - dimensional numerical simulations of the bh accretion disk became feasible ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and revealed the inner structure of the disks within roughly a hundred schwarzschild radii of the central bhs .",
    "those results have shown that the accretion rate onto the bh from the surrounding disk can indeed exceed the eddington - limited rate , as predicted by the slim disk model .",
    "they also have given some implications on the directional dependence of high - energy photons from the inner part of the disk although the structure in the distant equatorial region ( larger than about a hundred schwarzschild radii ) is not reliably calculated .",
    "winds from the disk can also shield the outer region from irradiation of the high - energy photons from the inner region as shown by @xcite for the present - day line - driven agn winds from the standard disk ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to summarize , radiation from the accretion disk has some anisotropy , but its actual directional dependence , especially that in the equatorial direction , is still far from understood .",
    "in this paper , we will investigate accretion of the primordial gas onto bhs in the presence of anisotropic radiation fields from the central circum - bh accretion disks , considering shadowing effect by the outer part of the disks .",
    "for that purpose , we perform a set of proof - of - concept two - dimensional ( 2d ) radiation hydrodynamics ( rhd ) simulations , assuming a bh is initially embedded in a homogeneous and static medium . since the directional dependence of bh radiation is highly uncertain , as mentioned above , we model it by introducing a parameter specifying its effectiveness and study how the anisotropy of radiation changes the structure of accretion flows . as confirmed later by our results",
    ", the accretion rate can be dramatically increased by the gas inflow in the shadowed region .",

    "the bondi radius @xmath27 defined as a transonic point , demarcates the inner region where the bh gravity dominates in controlling the gas dynamics and the outer region where the thermal pressure does .",
    "correspondingly , the structure inside @xmath28 is given approximately by that of the free falling flow , while the pressure equilibrium is roughly maintained outside @xmath28 .",
    "the eddington luminosity @xmath29 is the critical luminosity at which the outward radiation force via the thomson scattering exerted on an ionized hydrogen gas is balanced with the inward gravitational pull of the bh : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the thomson scattering cross section .",
    "note that the eddington luminosity is not the strict upper limit because forces other than radiation pressure or gravity , e.g. , gas pressure , can also be present and , in addition , the thomson scattering opacity becomes lower in a partially ionized gas .",

    "an hii bubble is created by photoionization .",
    "the gas inside the hii bubble is heated up to @xmath41 by helium photoionization for the radiation spectrum @xmath42 , as often postulated in the literature .",
    "the accompanying increase in the thermal pressure can significantly reduce the accretion rate onto the bh , which is further diminished by the radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "the size of the hii bubble in a homogeneous medium can be estimated by the strmgren radius @xmath43 , obtained by equating the ionizing photon emissivity @xmath44 with the recombination rate within the hii bubble @xmath45 , where @xmath46 for the above spectrum , @xmath47 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei inside the bubble , @xmath48 is the hydrogen ionization energy and @xmath49 is the case b recombination coefficient for @xmath50 at @xmath51 @xcite .",

    "the ionization front first propagates up to @xmath43 with @xmath47 kept almost constant .",
    "then the bubble expands due to the high pressure inside until the pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium is reached with @xmath55 , where the factor of @xmath56 in the denominator comes from the increase in the particle number at ionization . in the estimate above , we have neglected the effect of helium except for the temperature determination , because it only modifies the estimate of @xmath43 and @xmath47 slightly . here",

    ", the bondi radius and accretion rate are given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "this clearly shows that the thermal pressure in the bubble significantly reduces the accretion rate .    in order for the hii bubble to be sustained around the bh , the condition @xmath59 must be satisfied @xcite",
    "otherwise , the gas originally in between @xmath43 and @xmath28 would accumulate around the periphery of the hii bubble , which leads to the enhancement of density @xmath47 and thus to shrinkage of the bubble radius @xmath43 . in the end",
    ", the hii bubble totally vanishes and radiation feedback no longer affects the accretion . at that time , the accretion proceeds efficiently with a rate as high as the original bondi value for the neutral gas @xmath37 , instead of that in the hii bubble @xmath60 . for this to happen",
    ", a system with a massive bh and/or dense ambient medium , namely @xmath61 @xcite , is needed when the bh luminosity is close to the eddington value as @xmath62 .",

    "[ fig : acc_whole ] shows the situation we suppose below .",

    "we do not consider the gas self - gravity , which is not important currently . only the gravity from the central bh is taken into account .",

    "] in contrast , we have newly added the @xmath70-chemistry , considering the fact that hard uv photons from the bh accretion disk create broad photoionized regions of @xmath70 and @xmath71 associated with additional photoionization heating .    in the end",

    "we turn off the cooling when the temperature falls below @xmath76 , as in the previous 2d simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we neglect secondary ionization and heating by photoelectrons by x - rays , because we have found with experiments that these processes only slightly enhance the ionization degree just outside the hii bubble , which hardly affects the gas dynamics .      as in @xcite",
    ", we only solve the transfer of ionizing photons directly coming from the central accretion disk .",
    "the diffuse recombination photons within the hii bubble are taken into account with the on - the - spot approximation . the radial radiation transfer coupled with the chemistry",
    "is successively solved in a radial direction from the innermost cell , where photons are injected in accordance with the sub - grid radiation model ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : radiation ] below ) .",
    "we evaluate the number of photons consumed in each cell to obtain the flux at the next cell , while we do not consider the absorption within the sink .    regarding the transport of uv photons ,",
    "we have added the following major updates .",
    "first , we have newly implemented the frequency - dependent transfer with 128 logarithmically - spaced frequency bins between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which allows us to accurately solve the photoionization of @xmath72 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 within the hii bubble .",
    "second , we consider the radiation pressure via thomson scattering and photoionization . in section  [ sec : result ] below , we will see that the gas dynamics is substantially affected by this effect when the luminosity of the central bh - disk system exceeds the eddington value .",
    "we simply assume that photons with energy @xmath79 freely escape from the system following @xcite .",
    "although the radiation pressure of ly@xmath80 photons can also affect the gas dynamics under the perfect spherical symmetry , this effect is expected to be minor with realistic aspherical accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in modeling the bh radiation",
    ", we assume the ionizing photons from the inner part of a circum - bh accretion disk are absorbed ( or scattered ) by some outer structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : acc_whole]a ) .",
    "ionizing photons are injected at the inner boundary depending on the inflow rate into the sink region , with the directional dependence according to the model described here . in the following ,",
    "we first describe the structure of the bh accretion disk , which motivates our subgrid model in section  [ sec : acc_disk ] , and then give the expressions for the luminosity and directional dependence in sections  [ sec : efficiency ] and [ sec : direction_dep ] , respectively .",
    "[ fig : acc_whole](a ) shows the expected inner structure including a bh accretion disk , although its actual picture is still uncertain .",
    "below we describe such a structure one by one from the inner to outer parts , and consider resulting directional dependences of the bh radiation .",
    "we see that the bh is surrounded by the two different types of accretion disks .",
    "one is the geometrically thick ( aspect ratio @xmath81 ) slim disk within the photon trapping radius @xmath82 , where the cooling via radial advection balances with the viscous heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other is the geometrically thin ( aspect ratio @xmath83 ) standard accretion disk outside @xmath84 , where the radiative loss from the disk surfaces is the main cooling process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath85 , the standard accretion disk continues all the way to the inner - most part of the disk and the slim disk does not appear at all .",
    "we model the luminosity according to these structures in section  [ sec : efficiency ] .",
    "since the surface temperature of the disk increases with the decreasing radius @xmath86 , ionizing photons mostly come from the hot inner part .    in the outer parts ,",
    "the photo - heated disk surface might launch a disk wind ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for line - driven disk wind ) , while the vertically falling gas due to the centrifugal barrier might collide with the one coming from the opposite direction around the equatorial plane to form a shocked region .",
    "[ fig : acc_whole](a ) depicts these structures , both of which can absorb ( or scatter ) the ionizing photons coming from the inner part , forming a shadowed region behind them .",
    "note that the structure of such an outer part is highly uncertain and probably varies depending on the bh mass , accretion rate , angular momentum and metallicity of inflowing gas , etc .",
    "thus , in section  [ sec : direction_dep ] , we model the shadowing effect in a simple parametric fashion to clearly see its consequences .      in our simulation",
    ", we determine the luminosity of the bh radiation @xmath87 depending on @xmath88 evaluated at the inner boundary at each time step .",
