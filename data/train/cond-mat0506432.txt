    "in the last 35 years v@xmath1o@xmath2 has been the subject of wide experimental and theoretical investigations , after its identification as the prototype of mott - hubbard systems . @xcite during the seventies an intensive set of measurements@xcite was performed in order to clarify its crystal and magnetic structure as well as its transport properties .",
    "two metal - insulator transitions were found : one from a paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) to an antiferromagnetic insulating ( afi ) phase , below @xmath3 k , associated with a corundum - to - monoclinic crystal distortion ; the other from the pm to a paramagnetic insulating ( pi ) phase at higher temperatures ( above @xmath4 k ) . the pi phase can also be obtained by means of a small ( @xmath5 ) cr - doping : in this case cr ions act as a negative pressure , thus enlarging the average cation - cation distance and inducing a mott - insulator transition . as reviewed , eg , in ref . [ ] , all transitions are due to the interplay between band formation and electron coulomb correlation .    in 1978 castellani ,",
    "natoli and ranninger@xcite gave a realistic description of the complex magnetic properties and phase diagram of v@xmath1o@xmath2 , focusing on the peculiar magnetic structure observed in the afi phase , which breaks the high - temperature trigonal symmetry and can not be explained in terms of a single - band hubbard model .",
    "they realized that the introduction of the extra degree of freedom represented by the degeneracy of t@xmath6-vanadium orbitals was necessary to describe correctly the spin structure , whose driving mechanism was the ordered pattern of t@xmath6-orbitals throughout the whole crystal .",
    "this model was found to be in need of correction only more than 20 years later , when two experiments of non - resonant magnetic x - ray scattering@xcite and linear dichroism@xcite independently demonstrated that the average spin value on each vanadium ion is @xmath7 , contrary to the previously supposed @xmath8.@xcite these latter measurements stimulated a renewed interest in the system , that led to a new picture for its ground - state , where the two nearest v - ions are linked together in a stable molecule with spin @xmath9.@xcite when considered together with the available sets of x - ray diffraction data,@xcite and polarized neutron experiments,@xcite this model predicts that the afi phase is not magnetoelectric , as further confirmed by two experiments.@xcite    yet , this seems not to be in keeping with the detection of non - reciprocal effects in linear dichroism , in ref .",
    ", whose existence requires a magnetoelectric ( me ) phase . indeed , on the basis of diffraction data,@xcite the magnetic space group ( msg ) for the afi phase of v@xmath1o@xmath2 turns out to be @xmath10 , which is not magnetoelectric , because it explicitly contains both time - reversal ( @xmath11 ) and inversion ( @xmath12 ) symmetries .",
    "however , a necessary condition to reveal a non - reciprocal signal is that none of them be a symmetry operator.@xcite thus , as better detailed in ref . [ ] , the interpretation of ref .",
    "[ ] is in contradiction with the usually accepted msg .    in this work we present a new experiment of vanadium k",
    "edge absorption and linear dichroism , with the aim of clarifying the physical picture and solve the controversy about the ground - state symmetry of v@xmath1o@xmath2 . in order to better compare with the results of ref .",
    "[ ] , we used the same single crystal , which is 2.8@xmath0 cr - doped .",
    "the theoretical framework at the basis of this experiment is the one introduced in ref .",
    "[ ] , where the possibility of a structural origin for the observed dichroism was suggested and a numerical prediction of the effect was carried out . as shown in the next two sections , the present measurement confirms that prediction and calls for a final experiment to check the effect of a me annealing procedure@xcite when cooling the system down to its afi phase .",
    "in the monoclinic low - temperature phase pure v@xmath1o@xmath2 , as well as the 2.8@xmath0 chromium - doped sample used in the experiment , crystallizes in the body - centered classical space group @xmath13,@xcite with two groups of four v ions in the unit cell , which are translationally equivalent ( together with their oxygen environment ) apart from the opposite direction of magnetic moments.@xcite x - ray absorption spectra at v k edge ( e@xmath14=5465 ev ) were collected at the id26 beamline of the european synchrotron radiation facility in fluorescence mode .",
    "the x - ray beam energies were selected by a double crystal si(220 ) , fixed exit monochromator with an energy resolution of about 0.3 ev at v k edge .",
    "the id26 beamline worked in the so - called gap - scan mode , that is tuning the maximum of the undulator emission to the actual monochromator rocking curve .",
    "two mirrors provided an harmonic free , small ( diameter @xmath15 ) , intense x - ray spot size on the sample , linearly polarized in the horizontal plane . the fluorescence intensity emitted from the sample",
    "was collected in the total - fluorescence mode by measuring the current from two photodiodes , mounted parallel to the polarization of the incoming beam in order to minimize the elastic contribution to the spectrum .",
    "the 2.8@xmath0 chromium - doped v@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal ( about @xmath16 mm@xmath17 ) was mounted in a closed cycle he refrigerator , properly oriented with respect to the horizontal linear polarization of the x - ray beam and cooled down to 80 k. absorption spectra were collected in quick - exafs mode ( 20 seconds per scan ) in the energy range 5300 - 6300 ev ( about 4000 points per scan ) .",
    "our geometrical setup allowed to have very narrow bragg peaks . in order to remove them ,",
    "several ( @xmath1860 ) spectra were collected at different angles by rocking the sample ( @xmath19 2 deg . ) around the vertical axis . with this procedure bragg peaks",
    "were shifted and could be easily distinguished from the true spectral features .",
    "averaging up all the scans then provided exceptional quality , low noise , xas spectra suitable for accurate quantitative studies .",
    "all data were collected for three orthogonal directions of polarization , ie , along the corundum c - axis , and in the hexagonal plane , along the monoclinic b@xmath20-axis and orthogonal to it , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . here",
    "we analyze the data collected in the near - edge region .",
    "at v k edge , the x - ray absorption cross - section for the @xmath21 vanadium ion in the unit cell is given by :      the operator @xmath23 is the usual matter - radiation interaction operator expanded up to the quadrupolar term , with photon polarisation @xmath24 and wave vector @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the ground ( excited ) state of the crystal and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) its energy .",
    "the sum is extended over all the excited states of the system , @xmath30 is the energy of the incoming photon and @xmath31 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "the total cross - section is obtained by summing up over all 8 ions in the unit cell : @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding sum - rule for both structural and non - reciprocal linear dichroism was already derived in ref .",
    "[ ] in the framework of multiple scattering theory .",
    "here we just remind that on the basis of the usually accepted @xmath10 msg,@xcite linear dichroism in the hexagonal plane is expected to be at a maximum when one of the two orthogonal polarizations is parallel to the monoclinic b@xmath20-axis , thus orthogonal to the glide plane , and is zero when both polarizations are at @xmath33 degrees with the latter .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the experimental data in the xanes region for the three polarization directions : when the x - ray polarization is along the c - axis ( c ) , dichroism with respect to the other two directions is apparent ; less manifest , but still clear is the dichroism within the hexagonal plane , with the x - ray polarizations respectively parallel to the monoclinic b@xmath20-axis ( b ) and perpendicular to it ( a ) .",
    "such dichroism is explictly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , instead , we have plotted a numerical simulation of the `` in - plane '' xanes , as calculated in the framework of the multiple scattering ( ms ) theory within the muffin - tin approximation , and superimposed the experimental curve ( b ) for a better comparison . as in ref .",
    "[ ] , we chose a cluster containing 135 atoms , _",
    "i.e. _ , 54 vanadium and 81 oxygen atoms in the correct ratio 2 to 3 , having a radius of 6.9  , enough to get convergence with the cluster size .",
    "the spectrum calculated with the real part of the hedin - lundqvist ( hl ) potential is convoluted with a lorentzian function having an energy dependent damping @xmath34 , derived from the universal mean free path curve by the relation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the photoelectron kinetic energy ( in rydbergs ) and @xmath37 its wave vector .",
    "the agreement between experimental measurements and numerical simulations is quite good , even though the energy distance between the peak at 5467 ev and the highest peak is underestimated in the theory ( 18 ev vs. 20.5 ev ) .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the potential adopted to describe the electron - atom scattering in the ms equations , whose hl exchange - correlation part@xcite is known to be too attractive near the edge.@xcite    this compression of the energy scale in the theoretical signal is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where experimental and theoretical `` in - plane '' linear dichroisms are compared . in spite of it , all other main features of the experiment are well described by our calculation , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , where the theoretical energy scale is expanded by a factor of 1.14 in order to better guide the eye : in this case all main peaks and valleys are correctly reproduced at almost all energies .",
    "the same happens for xanes in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , apart from the experimental signal around 5470 ev , to be probably related to the upper hubbard band,@xcite which is missed by our single - particle approach .",
    "even more important , no extra scale factors are needed to describe the relative intensity of linear dichroism and xanes spectra , as both experiment and theory show a ratio of about 3@xmath0 .",
    "finally , the calculated intensity is found to be of purely dipolar ( e1-e1 ) origin , due to the structural monoclinic distortion , and not of magnetic origin .    all this is to be compared with the absence of structural linear dichroism measured in ref .",
    "[ ] , as derived from their fig .",
    "2 , where the average signal in the two magnetic field configurations is shown .",
    "the apparent contradiction can be rationalized only in two ways , as suggested in ref .",
    "[ ] : either by assuming a transition to another monoclinic domain , subsequent to the me annealing procedure , or by an accidental geometrical setup such that the two orthogonal polarizations were at 45@xmath38 from the b@xmath20-monoclinic axis . in this latter case",
    "there is no structural dichroism , as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] .    in the present experiment , when the system was heated up to its pi phase and then cooled back to the afi phase , without any me annealing procedure , we found a transition to the same monoclinic domain .",
    "even though a proper explanation of this phenomenon is still lacking , it is interesting to note that all @xmath39 cr - doped v@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals used in resonant x - ray scattering experiments@xcite had the tendency to form one big monodomain , instead of a statistical mixture of the three possible .    under the assumption of polarization at 45@xmath38 from the b@xmath20-axis , the appearence of a non - reciprocal signal in the afi phase might find its origin in the me annealing procedure , that might have driven the system to a nearby excited me state that is known to exist from ref .",
    "[ ] . however , we would like to stress again that the relative intensity of the linear dichroism at the main peak is about 3@xmath0 of xanes in all three cases , i.e. , the present experiment , our theoretical calculation , and ref .",
    "[ ] , thus strongly pointing towards a common origin of the three , given also the similarity in shape . in this respect , the possibility that the signal of ref .",
    "[ ] be of magnetic e1-e2 origin is in contradiction with the resonant x - ray scattering results of paolasini it et al.@xcite : there it is shown that the @xmath40 reflection , of e1-e1 nature , is 100 times more intense than the @xmath41 , of e1-e2 magnetic origin , which is moreover restricted to the pre - edge region ( @xmath42 ev ) and not extended for more than 40 ev , like the linear dichroism of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the factor 10 in the amplitude ratio of e1-e1 and e1-e2 signals for a single @xmath43-ion site",
    "is also confirmed by our ab - initio calculations , as well as by the practical absence of states with @xmath44 symmetry in the energy range 5474 - 5505 ev .    in conclusion , the e1-e1 origin of this linear dichroism experiment",
    "is well supported by a robust theoretical framework and calls for a further , definitive , investigation of the ground state properties of v@xmath1o@xmath2 in its low - temperature phase subsequent to a magnetoelectric annealing .",
