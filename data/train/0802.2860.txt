    "we first prove that it does not injure the edge entries in column @xmath108 which have already been satisfied .",
    "the reason is similar to that in phase t2 . because @xmath206 , the action only injures the rows with indices less than @xmath207 .",
    "the cost of the action is different from that in phase t2 in that it may affect the edge entries in the last column which have already been satisfied in phases t1 and t2 .",
    "because @xmath171 and @xmath172 contain the same number of @xmath16 s , which is at least @xmath18 , all the row changes made by the action always add a zero edge entry of the last column to another zero edge entry in the same column .",
    "hence , it does not injure the satisfied entries in the last column .",
    "additionally , it is obvious that the last two rows are preserved during the current action , so the left - bottom most entry , the edge entries in the last row and entry @xmath192 are all preserved .    * phase t4 for row @xmath108 * :",
    "similar actions to that in phase t4 for the column above can be applied to the row @xmath108 to change its edge entries to 0 s .",
    "therefore , t4 realizes its goal , at the same time , it preserves the satisfied entries in phases t1  t3 .",
    "we have realized the phases t1  t4 prescribed in section [ sec : tranformation t1-t4 ] , by corollary [ cor : standardmg ] , @xmath78 is a reducible character matrix .",
    "the lemma follows .",
    "we prove by induction on @xmath0 that for every @xmath0 , and every @xmath208 character matrix @xmath33 , if @xmath33 is invertible , then @xmath85 is a character matrix .",
    "the case for @xmath209 is easy , the first proof was given by valiant in @xcite .",
    "suppose by induction that the theorem holds for @xmath210 .",
    "by lemma [ lem : changetoreducible ] , there exist nonsingular character matrices @xmath211 and @xmath212 such that @xmath213 is the character matrix of a reducible matchgate @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath214 be the @xmath215 character matrix of @xmath40 constructed from @xmath109 by deleting the bottom edge .",
    "since @xmath33 is invertible , so is @xmath78 , and so is @xmath214 by lemma [ lem : reductionlemma ] . by the inductive hypothesis , @xmath216 is a character matrix , so is @xmath217 by lemma [ lem : reductionlemma ] .    by the choice of @xmath211 and @xmath212 , for all @xmath218 and @xmath219",

    "this completes the proof of theorem [ thm : ourselfprop ] .",
    "we notice that the inductive argument in the proof of theorem [ thm : ourselfprop ] also gives a different proof for the result in the case of @xmath1 .",
    "our method is a constructive , and uniform one .",
    "it may have some more applications .",
    "we introduce nine types of matchgates as our elementary gates .",
    "we use @xmath221 , to denote the elementary level @xmath3 matchgates corresponding to that in the following fig .",
    "[ figs : p5 ] ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) , ( g ) , ( h ) and ( i ) respectively .",

    "all edges connecting an input and an output node except for the edge in @xmath223 , and the diagonal edge in @xmath224 , are all of weight 1 .",
    "the remaining edges take weights @xmath197 .",
    "@xmath222 makes a row ( or column , when it is multiplied from right side ) exchange , which is a special transformation , of the character matrix according to a bit flip on the label , and it is used to move a nonzero entry to the right - bottom most entry by the same way as that in the proof of theorem [ prop : kehua ] in @xcite .",
    "@xmath225 is used to realize @xmath226 , and to turn a nonzero entry to 1 .",
    "both @xmath222 and @xmath225 are only used in the first phase , i.e. t1 , of the transformation . intuitively , @xmath227 can exchange two consecutive bits , and it allows us to apply some other elementary gates to nonconsecutive bits . @xmath185 and @xmath228",

    "@xmath230 is used to realize zero matrix . to understand the composition of @xmath227 with other elementary gates , we need the following :    [ lem : effectofgamma_c ] suppose @xmath33 is the character matrix of a @xmath0-bit matchcircuit @xmath109 , and @xmath231 , @xmath232 are two arbitrary permutations on @xmath0 elements .",

    "for the first case , the gate must be an even or an odd gate , we observe that only even and odd gates are used in the transformation for an even or an odd gate . for the second case , we extend its matrix , and replace it by a new even gate which is applied to consecutive bits reducing it to the first case .",
