    "we calculate the racetrack and interaction potentials based on a micromagnetic model which considers the exchange coupling @xmath7 of spins , interfacial dm interactions @xmath8 and an external magnetic field @xmath9 , see methods  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "we have checked that a realistic anisotropy does not change the main results qualitatively and thus neglect anisotropies and also dipolar interactions for simplicity . within our setup ,",
    "all results depend only on a small number of dimensionless parameters , see methods  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "most imporantly , all length scales are measured in units of @xmath10 , which ranges from 1 - 100 nm for different types of skyrmion realizations@xcite .",
    "the field @xmath11 is chosen such that it stabilizes single skyrmions and they do not decay into bimerons@xcite .    the effective skyrmion potential can be designed by changing the height and width of the track and the barrier . for fixed widths , we find that for a wide range of parameters , the dependence on the height of the track and the barrier can to high accuracy be obtained from a simple linear relation @xmath12 the simple additivity reflects that deformations of the magnetic texture along the track normal are small and it may be useful to design track potentials in experimental systems . qualitatively the shape of the potentials can be understood from the fact that skyrmions are repelled by edges@xcite",
    ". therefore not only the track potential raises towards the edge of the track but also the barrier itself is repulsive , see fig .",
    "the magnetic texture is continued from the bottom layers into the nanostructured upper layers , where effectively the skyrmion is in close proximity to an edge .",
    "we find the largest potential barriers if the strip and the skyrmion are of comparable width , compare fig .",
    "if the strip is very broad , the skyrmion in the center of the track is again relatively far away from the edges in the barrier structure .",
    "the exact shape of the potential , however , strongly depends on the width of the strip .    in the following ,",
    "we will focus on a particular example of a two - lane racetrack .",

    "[ eq : potential_skyrmion - single_superposition ] , an estimation of the potential yields a double - well shape with two degenerate minima . as a check , we calculated the full potential of this geometry and find that the results are in very good argeement , see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b .",
    "finally , we also calculated the potential of two interacting skyrmions where we have to distinguish the two cases where skyrmions move in the same or in different lanes , see methods  [ sec : methods ] . in both cases",
    "the interactions are always repulsive , see fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , and scale linearly in the height of the structure .",
    "note that for the chosen parameters the repulsive interaction of skyrmions in different lanes is sizable and comparable to the height of the barrier between the lanes .",
    "the above analysis of the separating potential provides a toolbox to engineer the barrier in a way that the order of the skyrmions is conserved with the help of repulsive potentials . for the operation of the two - lane racetrack as a memory device",
    ", a read and write protocol is needed .",
    "the thermodynamic ground state of the two - lane racetrack is the polarized phase for parameters discussed above . due to their topology ,",
    "metastable skyrmions are , however , even at room temperatures very stable @xcite . to initialize the track , i.e. fill it with skyrmions",
    ", we suggest to simply lower the magnetic field for a short period , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and supplementary movie 1 . as discussed in ref .",
    ", this triggers an edge instability where magnons with finite momentum condense at both edges .",
    "the polarized phase then becomes unstable and a chain of merons invades from the edges .",
    "technically , one has to add a small noise term or an edge inhomogeneity to trigger the magnon condensation . in an experimental realization this is done by defects and thermal fluctuations . by afterwards increasing the field above the critical field to its original value , each meron either pulls a second meron from the edge to form a skyrmion , or is pushed back into the edge and vanishes .",
    "thereby the system automatically generates a finite density of skyrmions .",
    "we find that the average distance between skyrmions , here approximately @xmath13 , is equal to the wavelength of the edge instability .",

    "one option is to use a tunnel contact on top or below each lane which exploits the non - collinear magnetoresistance of a skyrmion@xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could also use the topological hall effect@xcite to detect skyrmions .",
    "once a skyrmion is detected , one can decide if it has to switch lanes or already represents the desired information .",
    "the lane change , in general , can be induced by a variety of forces .",
    "while in insulating materials magnonic currents provide an extremely efficient method to control skyrmion motion in nanostructures@xcite , we restrict our considerations to only electric currents .",
    "the here considered write element consist of a pair of nanocontacts attached to both edges of the track , such that an applied electric current pulse flows predominantly through a narrow stripe as depicted in fig .",
    "the stripe has to be narrow such that only one skyrmion is affected by the current pulse . for our calculations ,",
    "we choose a stripe with a width of @xmath16 .",
    "the minimal current density required to induce a lane change can be roughly estimated from the separating potential barrier @xmath17 in a thiele approach@xcite .",
    "the simplified thiele equation , the equation of motion for the skyrmion coordinate @xmath18 , see methods  [ sec : methods ] , reads : @xmath19 a suitable current density for a lane change @xmath20 requires that during the lane change , the transversal shift of the skyrmion is smaller than the width of the current carrying region . solving the thiele equation numerically for various @xmath20 , which can easily be done ,",

    "the current - driven motion of skyrmions in a nanostructure has been nicely discussed in refs .   and .",
    "as previously pointed by the authors , one can obtain much higher velocities for skyrmions moving in racetracks compared to freely moving skyrmions .",
    "alternatively , the skyrmions can be driven highly efficient by a magnonic current@xcite .",
    "using one of these methods , the bit sequence is driven along the two lanes , see also supplementary movie 2 .",
    "we propose a new approach towards skyrmion - based storage devices .",
    "the two - lane skyrmion racetrack uses the displacement of skyrmions in a racetrack relative to the center of the track to encode information .",
    "we provide methods to calculate the potential barrier between different lanes as well as the interaction between skyrmions in the lanes . in this paper",
    "we show that these potentials can be used to efficiently design such a two - lane racetrack and to determine current pulses to write information . with these informations",
    "we explain how to operate a particular example of a two - lane racetrack by electric current pulses and confirm the results by micromagnetic simulations .",
    "dispite that the model we used throughout this work does not take into account uniaxial anisotropy or dipolar interactions , which may be of interest for realistic systems , the idea presented here is universal .",

    "previous works fixed this center of the skyrmion to evaluate the potential at various positions@xcite . in this setup , however , the forces from the nanostructures are large compared to the artificial pinning forces .",
    "therefore we can not fix the skyrmion coordinate .",
    "we resolve this problem by a dynamical evaluation of the potential , i.e. we record the energy while running a simulation of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation in which the skyrmion moves adiabatically , i.e. slow enough that no internal modes are excited . in order to guide the skyrmion to different positions",

    "note that when running on different lanes , the magnus force breaks the mirror symmetry of the motion , i.e. it makes a difference if the skyrmions run on the right or the left lane . for skyrmions on the same lane , the magnus force can induce a lane change if the damping is low ( @xmath64 ) . as we are interested in the low energy limit , we suppress these effects by a relatively large damping @xmath65 .      in the thiele analysis",
    "one assumes that the dynamics of the magnetic texture reduces to an effective particle coordinate @xmath66 in the two - dimensional plane , @xmath67 .",

    "for the analysis of a lane change , we assume a constant current density in the whole system .",
    "however we note that the thiele ansatz then only holds as long as the skyrmion is at sufficient distance ( @xmath77 ) to the edges of the area where the current density is actually applied .",
