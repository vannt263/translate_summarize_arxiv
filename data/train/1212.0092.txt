    "the multivariate compound poisson process is an intuitively appealing and natural model for operational risk and insurance claim modelling .",
    "the model is intuitively appealing because dependencies between different loss categories are caused by common shocks that apply to multiple loss categories simultaneously .",
    "for example , in operational risk modelling , failure of an it system is a common shock that causes losses in multiple lines of business .",
    "the multivariate compound poisson process is a natural model for the following two reasons .",
    "first , as a lvy process , it is easily applied to any time horizon of interest .",
    "second , because a redesign of loss categories results in a loss process that is again multivariate compound poisson , the nature of the model does not depend on the level of granularity @xcite .",
    "a multivariate compound poisson process can be specified in terms of univariate compound poisson processes and a  copula @xcite .",
    "in essence , a  copula provides the relationship between the  measure of a multivariate  process and the  measures of its marginal processes .",
    "the  copula allows for a parsimonious bottom - up modelling with compound poisson processes . in case of two loss categories , for example ,",
    "parameterization with a clayton  copula requires two marginal frequencies , two marginal jump size distributions and one  copula parameter .",
    "in contrast , parameterization without a  copula requires three frequencies ( corresponding to losses of the first category only , losses of the second category only and common shocks that apply to both categories ) , two univariate jump size distributions ( corresponding to losses of one of the two categories only ) and , finally , one bivariate jump size distribution ( corresponding to the common shocks ) .    the parameters of a  copula of a multivariate compound poisson process can be estimated if the process is either observed continuously ( such that common shocks can be identified ) or observed discretely with knowledge about all jump sizes and the common shocks .",
    "these two cases have been studied by @xcite for a bivariate compound poisson process ( the continuous observation is mimicked in a simulation study , while the discrete observation corresponds to a real data set of insurance claims ) .",
    "the objective of this work is to develop a method to estimate the parameters of a  copula of a bivariate compound poisson process in case the process is observed discretely with knowledge about all jump sizes , but without knowledge of which jumps stem from common shocks .",
    "this situation is relevant to operational risk modelling in which all material losses are registered , but common shocks are typically unknown . with the methodology developed here , the  copula becomes a realistic tool of the advanced measurement approach of operational risk .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ cpp ]",
    ", we discuss the bivariate compound poisson process in terms of its common shock representation and  measure .",
    "this prepares the ground for the two - dimensional  copula of section [ levy_copula ] . in section [ mle ] , the new estimation method of the discretely observed bivariate compound poisson process",
    "is presented .",

    "the results indicate that the clayton  copula provides a good fit to the data set .",
    "the method developed in this work is particularly useful in the context of operational risk modelling in which common shocks are typically unknown . to model dependencies between operational losses of different loss categories , the common practice in the banking industry",
    "is to use a distributional copula between either the number of losses or the aggregate losses within a certain time window .",
    "a disadvantage of this approach is that the distributional copula depends non - trivially on the length of the time window .",
    "if one has , for example , estimated a distributional copula between monthly losses , the distributional copula between yearly losses is typically unknown .",
    "a second disadvantage of the approach is that the nature of the model depends on the level of granularity .",
    "if one combines , for example , two loss categories connected by a distributional copula , the new loss category is typically not compound poisson .",
    "these two issues are resolved by a multivariate compound poisson process , which can be parsimoniously modelled with a  copula in a bottom - up approach .",
