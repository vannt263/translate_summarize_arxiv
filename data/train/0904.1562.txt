    "does the solar system contain an undiscovered massive planet or a distant stellar companion of the sun ?",
    "the history of an hypothetical planet x dates back to the early suggestions by the astronomer p. @xcite who thought that some glitches in the orbit of uranus might be caused by what he dubbed planet x. in 1930 , the search that lowell initiated led to the discovery of pluto @xcite .",
    "the various constraints on the mass and position of a putative planet x , as candidate to accommodate the alleged orbital anomalies of uranus @xcite , were summarized by @xcite .",
    "later , the claimed residuals in the orbit of uranus were explained by @xcite in terms of small systematic errors as an underestimate of the mass of neptune by @xmath16 .",
    "however , the appeal of a yet undiscovered solar system s body of planetary size never faded . indeed , according to @xcite , a ninth planet as large as",
    "the earth may exist beyond pluto , at about 100 - 170 au , to explain the architecture of the edgeworth - kuiper belt .",
    "previously , @xcite proposed the existence of a mars - size body at 60 au to explain certain features in the distribution of the trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) like the so - called kuiper cliff where low - eccentricity and low - inclination ) kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) with semimajor axes greater than 50 au rapidly falls to zero , although several problems in explaining other features of the kuiper belt with such a hypothesis were pointed out later @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , a perturber body of mass @xmath17 at 25 kau would be able to explain the anomalous distribution of orbital elements of approximately @xmath18 of the 82 new class i oort cloud comets .",
    "a similar hypothesis was put forth by @xcite ; for a more skeptical view , see @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that distant detached objects among the tnos ( perihelion distance @xmath19 au and semimajor axis ,",
    "@xmath20 au ) may have been generated by a hypothetical neptune - mass companion having semiminor axis @xmath21 au or a jupiter - mass companion with @xmath22 au on significantly inclined orbits .",
    "however , generally speaking , we stress that we still have bad statistics about the tnos and the edgeworth - kuiper belt objects @xcite .    concerning the existence of a putative stellar companion of the sun , it was argued with different approaches . as an explanation of the peculiar properties of certain pulsars with anomalously small period derivatives , it was suggested by @xcite that the barycenter of the solar system is accelerated , possibly because the sun is a member of a binary system and has a hitherto undetected companion star .",
    "latest studies by @xcite constrain such a putative acceleration at a @xmath23 m s@xmath3 level ( @xmath24 s@xmath25 in units of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the speed of light in vacuum ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that the statistical periodicity of about 26 myr in extinction rates on the earth over the last 250 myr reported by @xcite can be explained by a yet undetected companion star ( called nemesis ) of the sun in a highly elliptical orbit that periodically would disturb comets in the oort cloud , causing a large increase in the number of comets visiting the inner solar system with a consequential increase in impact events on earth . in a recent work , @xcite used the hypothesis of nemesis to explain the measurements of the ages of 155 lunar spherules from the apollo 14 site .",
    "the exact nature of nemesis is uncertain ; it could be a red dwarf @xcite ( @xmath28 m@xmath29 ) , or a brown dwarf @xcite ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "for some resonant mechanisms between nemesis and the sun triggering oort cloud s comet showers at every perihelion passage , see @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite put forth the hypothesis that nemesis could be made up of the so called mirror matter , whose existence is predicted if parity is an unbroken symmetry of nature .    in this paper",
    "we constrain the distance of a very distant body for different values of its mass in a dynamical , model - independent way by looking at the gravitational effects induced by it on the motions of the inner planets orbiting in the @xmath31 au range . the same approach was followed by @xcite and @xcite to put constraints on density of diffuse dark matter in the solar system . in section [ calculo ]",
    "we calculate the acceleration imparted by a distant body x on an inner planet p and the resulting perihelion precession averaged over one orbital revolution of p. in section [ megafig ] we discuss the position - dependent constraints on the minimum distance at which x can exist for several values of its mass , and depict the forbidden regions for it in the three - dimensional space . in section [ fine ]",
    "we compare our results to other constraints existing in literature and summarize our findings .",
    "the gravitational acceleration imparted by a body of mass @xmath1 on a planet p is , with respect to some inertial frame , a_px = ( r_x - r_p).if , as in our case , it is supposed @xmath32 , by neglecting terms of order @xmath33 , it is possible to use the approximated formula + ( ) ^2,where _ xis the unit vector of x which can be assumed constant over one orbital revolution of p. by inserting in and neglecting the resulting term of order @xmath33 one has a_px",
    "-r_p + _ x+_x.the acceleration of consists of three terms : a non - constant radial hooke - type term , a non - constant term directed along the fixed direction of @xmath34 and a constant ( over the typical timescale of p ) term having the direction of @xmath34 as well . an equation identical to can be written also for the sun by replacing everywhere @xmath35 with @xmath36 ; thus , since we are interested in the motion of the planet p relative to the sun , the constant term cancels out , and by posing @xmath37 one can writes down the heliocentric perturbing acceleration felt by the planet p due to x a_x =",
    "a_hooke+a_n_x - r + _ x.in fact , the planetary observation - based quantities we will use in the following have been determined in the frame of reference of the presently known solar system s baricenter ( ssb ) . by the way , , where @xmath38 is to be intended as the position vector of p with respect to the known ssb , is valid also in this case .",
    "indeed , by repeating the same reasonings as before , we are led to a three - terms equation like in which the vectors entering it refer to the ssb frame ; now , if x existed , the ssb frame would be uniformly accelerated by a_ssb = _ x , so that p , referred to such a non - inertial ssb frame , would also be acted upon by an inertial acceleration a_in = -_x , in addition to the gravitational one of , which just cancels out the third constant term in leaving us with .",
    "note that , in general , it is not legitimate to neglect @xmath39 with respect to @xmath40 since = 3,where @xmath41 is the angle between @xmath38 and @xmath42 which , in general , may vary within @xmath43 during an orbital revolution of p. moreover , if the acceleration of a distant body could only be expressed by a hooke - type term , this would lead to the absurd conclusion that no bodies at all exist outside the solar system because the existence of an anomalous hooke - like acceleration has been ruled out by taking the ratio of the perihelia of different pairs planets @xcite .    the acceleration of is in agreement with the potential u_x= proposed by @xcite .",
    "the action of on the orbit of a known planet of the solar system can be treated perturbatively with the gauss equations @xcite of the variations of the keplerian orbital elements    where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the semi - major axis , the eccentricity , the inclination , the longitude of the ascending node , the argument of pericenter and the mean anomaly of the orbit of the test particle , respectively , @xmath50 is the argument of latitude ( @xmath51 is the true anomaly ) , @xmath52 is the semi - latus rectum and @xmath53 is the un - perturbed keplerian mean motion ; @xmath54 are the radial , transverse and normal components of a generic perturbing acceleration @xmath55 . by evaluating them onto the un - perturbed keplerian ellipse r = and averaging because over one orbital revolution the pericentre @xmath48 can be assumed constant . ]",
    "them over one orbital period @xmath56 of the planet by means of = df , it is possible to obtain the long - period effects induced by .    in order to make contact with the latest observational determinations , we are interested in the averaged rate of the longitude of the pericenter @xmath57",
    "; its variational equation is indeed , the astronomer @xcite has recently estimated , in a least - square sense , corrections @xmath0 to the standard newtonian / einsteinian averaged precessions of the perihelia of the inner planets of the solar system , shown in table [ chebolas ] , by fitting almost one century of planetary observations of several kinds with the dynamical force models of the epm ephemerides ; since they do not include the force imparted by a distant companion of the sun , such corrections are , in principle , suitable to constrain the unmodelled action of such a putative body accounting for its direct action on the inner planets themselves and , in principle , the indirect one on them through the outer planetsbody mutual interactions have been , indeed , modelled in the epm ephemerides . ] ; we will discuss such an issue later .    concerning the calculation of the perihelion precession induced by , as already noted , @xmath58 can certainly be considered as constant over the orbital periods @xmath59 yr of the inner planets .",
    "such an approximation simplifies our calculations . in the case of the hook - type term of a_hooke=-_xr ,  _",
    "x=,the task of working out its secular orbital effects has been already performed several times in literature ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the result for the longitude of perihelion is _",
    "hooke=-_x=-.the treatment of the second term @xmath39 of is much more complex because it is not simply radial .",
    "indeed , its direction is given by @xmath34 which is fixed in the inertial space @xmath60 during the orbital motion of p. its components are the three direction cosines , so that the cartesian components of a_n_x = a_xi+a_yj+a_zkare @xmath61 in terms of the standard heliocentric angular coordinates is the usual longitude @xmath62 of the standard spherical coordinates , while @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the usual co - latitude of the standard spherical coordinates . ]",
    "@xmath65 , we can write the components of @xmath34 as @xmath66 with @xmath67 . in order to have the radial , transverse and normal components of @xmath39 to be inserted into the right - hand - sides of the gauss equations",
    "@xmath68 we need the cartesian components of the co - moving unit vectors @xmath69 : they are @xcite =(    c u  -iu + u + iu + iu +    ) =(    c -u - iu + -u+iu + iu +    ) =(    c i + -i + i +    )    in our specific case , @xmath47 is the longitude of the ascending node which yields the position of the line of the nodes , i.e. the intersection of the orbital plane with the mean ecliptic at the epoch ( j2000 ) , with respect to the reference @xmath70 axis pointing toward the aries point @xmath71 .",
    "since , according to - , the planet s coordinates @xmath72 enter the components of @xmath39 , we also need the expressions for the unperturbed coordinates of the planet @xcite @xmath73 thus , @xmath74 are non - linear functions of the three unknown parameters @xmath75 of x ; by computing the averaged perihelion precessions induced by @xmath40 and @xmath39 and comparing them with the estimated corrections @xmath0 to the usual perihelion precessions it is possible to have an upper bound on @xmath76 , and , thus , a lower bound on @xmath4 for given values of @xmath1 , as a function of the position of x in the sky , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "relatively simple analytical expressions can be found only for particular positions of the body x ; for example , by assuming @xmath78 , i.e. by considering x located somewhere along the @xmath79 axis , it is possible to obtain _ n_x=(1 + 2).in table [ nemesis ] we quote the lower bound on @xmath80 for several values of @xmath1 obtained from the maximum value of the estimated correction to the standard rate of the perihelion of mars applied to and .",
    "in general , the problem must be tackled numerically ; also in this case it turns out that the data from mars yield the tightest constraints . however , and are already enough to show that the effect of a body x could not be mimicked by a correction to the sun s quadrupole mass moment @xmath81 accounting for its imperfect modelling in the epm ephemerides .",
    "indeed , it is easy to show that the secular precession of the longitude of pericenter of a test body moving along an orbit with small eccentricity around an oblate body of equatorial radius @xmath82 is _",
    "j_2=n()^2(^2 i -i - ) .now , let us consider the case in which x is directed along the @xmath79 axis and the planet p has @xmath83 ; only the retrograde hooke - type precession of would be non - vanishing , while would induce a prograde rate .",
    "in figure [ nemesis_kappa ] we plot the maximum value of @xmath76 , obtained from the perihelion of mars which turns out to yield the most effective constraints , as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath84 is of the order of @xmath85 s@xmath3 .",
    "the minimum distance @xmath4 can be obtained for different values of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 as well according to r^min_x= ( ) ^1/3.we will consider the case of two rock - ice bodies with the masses of mars and earth , a giant planet with the mass of jupiter , a brown dwarf with @xmath86 , a red dwarf with @xmath87 and a sun - mass body with @xmath88 , non necessarily an active main - sequence star .",
    "it is also possible to visualize the forbidden region for x in the three - dimensional space by plotting its delimiting surface whose parameteric equations are @xmath89    in figure [ nemesispolar_marte ] we plot the minimum distance at which a body of mass @xmath90 can be found as a function of its latitude and longitude @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the largest value is about 85 au and occurs in the ecliptic plane ( @xmath91 ) at about @xmath92 deg .",
    "note that for @xmath93 deg , i.e. for x along the @xmath79 axis , the minimum distance is as in table [ nemesis ] , i.e. 70 au . for just a few positions in the sky such a mars",

    "we depict the surface of minimum distance delimiting the spatial region in which such a body can exist according to the data from mars .",
    "it has not a simple spherical shape , as it would have had if x exerted an isotropic force on mars , and it has a precise spatial orientation with respect to the @xmath60 frame .",

    ", it turns out that the shape of the central bun is rather oblate , approximately by @xmath94 , contrary to the lateral lobes which are more spherical .",
    "moreover , the largest forbidden regions in the ecliptic plane are two approximately orthogonal strips with a length of about 180 au ( see figure [ mars_equatorial ] depicting the situation in the ecliptic plane ) , while in the vertical direction there is a strip approximately 120 au long .    figures analogous to figure [ nemesispolar_marte]-figure [ mars_equatorial ] hold for bodies with the mass of the earth , jupiter , a brown dwarf ( @xmath95 ) , a red dwarf with @xmath6 and a sun - sized body .",
    "the results of table [ nemesis ] concerning the position of x along the @xmath79 axis are confirmed . the same qualitative features of the case @xmath90 occur . concerning an earth - sized body ,",
    "it could mainly be found at no less than @xmath11 au , with a minimum distance of 35 au for just a few positions in the sky .",
    "the minimum distance of a jupiter - like mass is @xmath12 au , with about @xmath96 au in some points . for a brown dwarf ( @xmath97 )",
    "the limiting distance is mainly @xmath13 au , with a minimum of 861 au at some positions , while for a red dwarf ( @xmath98 ) it is @xmath14 au , with a lowest value of 2,000 au .",
    "finally , a sun - mass body can not be located at less than @xmath15 au for most of the sky positions , with @xmath99 au at just a few points . in the case of an earth - sized body , the length of the largest ecliptical forbidden strip turns out to be about 400 au , while the vertical one amounts to about 300 au .",
    "concerning the strategy adopted so far , let us note that we compared the estimated @xmath0 for the inner planets to their computed perihelion precessions due to x through ; in fact , one should , in principle , also take into account the indirect effects of x on the inner planets of the solar system through its direct action on the outer planets . indeed ,",
    "if one of them is perturbed by x , its action on the inner planets will differ from the standard @xmath100body one , fully modelled in the epm ephemerides .",
    "to roughly evaluate such an effect , let us reason as follows .",
    "the position of both x and of an outer planet acted upon by x can approximately be considered as constant in space with respect to a rocky planet over a typical orbital period @xmath101 yr .",
    "the maximum value of the disturbing acceleration imparted by x on a giant planet g like jupiter will be of the order of a_gx3_xr_g710 ^ -12  m  s^-2;we used @xmath102 s@xmath3 .",
    "@xmath103 will displace the position of g with respect to its usual position by an amount r_gp^2_b310 ^ 3  mover @xmath101 yr during which @xmath103 can be considered as uniform . as a consequence , the maximum extra - acceleration @xmath104 induced on an inner planet p by g during @xmath56 can be evaluated as a_pg12(r_g)r210 ^ -15  m  s^-2;we have just used adapted to the present case . the perihelion precession induced by @xmath104 can roughly be evaluated by dividing it by the orbital velocity of p , i.e. @xmath105 , so that _ g10 ^",
    "-5  arcsec  cty^-1.it is about one order of magnitude smaller than the present - day accuracy in knowing the extra - precessions of the perihelia of the inner planets , as shown by table [ chebolas ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that the indirect effects of x on the inner planets through its action on the giant ones can be neglected , as we did .",
    "we will , now , compare our dynamical constraints with other ones obtained with different methods .",
    "first , we compare the dynamical constraints of table [ nemesis ] and , more generally , of our full analysis with those obtainable as @xmath106 from the upper bound on the solar system barycenter s acceleration @xmath107 m s@xmath3 recently derived by @xcite with an analysis of the timing data of several millisecond pulsars , pulsars in binary systems and pulsating white dwarf .",
    "indeed , an acceleration exerted on the known ssb would affect the observed value of the rate of the period change of astronomical clocks such as pulsars and pulsating white dwarfs .",
    "such a method is able to provide a uniform sensitivity over the entire sky .",
    "the pulsar - based , isotropic @xmath108 constraints are summarized in table [ nemesis2 ] . with",
    "we mean that the value of @xmath109 used can be ruled out for @xmath110 of the sky at @xmath111 confidence level with practically all the methods used by @xcite ; by using psr b@xmath112 the quoted acceleration is ruled out at @xmath111 confidence for @xmath113 of the sky .",
    "they are not competitive with those of table [ nemesis ] and of the rest of our analysis for all the bodies considered . however , according to @xcite , future timing of millisecond pulsars looking for higher order pulsar period derivatives should be able to extend such limits to several thousand au within a decade . a precise limit on the unmodeled relative acceleration between the solar system and psr j0437 - 4715 has recently been obtained by @xcite by comparing a vlbi - based measurement of the trigonometric parallax of psr j0437 - 4715 to the kinematic distance obtained from pulsar timing , which is calculated from the pulsar s proper motion and apparent rate of change of orbital period . as a result ,",
    "jupiter - mass planets within 226 au of the sun in @xmath114 of the sky ( @xmath111 confidence ) are excluded . proposals to search for primordial black holes ( pbhs ) with the square kilometer array by using modification of pulsar timing residuals when pbhs pass within about @xmath115 au and impart impulse accelerations to the earth",
    "have been put forth by @xcite .",
    "other acceleration - type @xmath108 constraints were obtained by looking for a direct action of x on the pioneer 10/11 spacecraft from an inspection of their tracking data @xcite : the upper bound in the ssb acceleration obtained in this way is @xmath116 m s@xmath3 .",
    "this translate in a re - scaling of the values of table [ nemesis2 ] by a factor @xmath117 , still not competitive with ours .",
    "@xcite looked for tidal - type @xmath118 constraints , like ours , with a dynamical approach based on numerical simulations of the data of the four outer planets over the time span @xmath119 .",
    "they found a relation among @xmath1 , in units of terrestrial masses , @xmath4 , in units of 0.1 kau , and @xmath120 , which is the standard deviation of the assumed gaussian random errors in @xmath9 and @xmath8 , in units of 0.1 arcsec ; it is , for the ecliptic plane , ( ) ^1/3.by assuming , rather optimistically , @xmath121 arcsec , yields for @xmath122 @xmath123 au , which is generally smaller than our limits for the ecliptic plane ; a more conservative value of @xmath124 arcsec yields @xmath125 au .",
    "it may be interesting to recall that @xcite predicted the existence of an alleged perturber of uranus with @xmath126 at a heliocentric distance of 44 au .",
    "let us , now , focus on direct observational limits .",
    "a planetary body would reflect the solar light and , therefore , could be detected in the optical or near - infrared surveys .",
    "@xcite conducted an all - sky optical survey that , in the plane of the ecliptic , yielded the following constrain ( ) ^1/6,by assuming a visual albedo @xmath127 @xcite . for an earth - sized body",
    "the limit is @xmath128 au .",
    "another optical survey yielding similar results was performed by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the reflected sunlight , also the x s own thermal emission would be detectable in the mid - to far - infrared .",
    "the @xmath129 all - sky survey @xcite would have been able to discover a gas giant in the range 70 au@xmath130 au , but without success , in agreement with our bounds for jupiter - sized bodies .",
    "a recent ecliptic survey was done by @xcite with the spacewatch telescope .",
    "this survey was sensitive to mars - sized objects out to 300 au and jupiter - sized planets out to 1,200 au ; for low inclinations to the ecliptic , it ruled out more than one to two pluto - sized objects out to 100 au and one to two mars - sized objects to 200 au . concerning the case of a sun - mass body ,",
    "the presence of a main - sequence star above the hydrogen - burning limit was excluded within 1 pc by the all - sky synoptic tycho-2 survey @xcite .",
    "observational constraints on the properties of x might be obtained by sampling the astrometric position of background stars over the entire sky with the future astrometric gaia mission @xcite .",
    "indeed , the apparent motion of x along the parallactic ellipse would deflect the angular position of distant stars due to the astrometric microlensing ( ) . a jupiter - sized planet at 2,000 au in the ecliptic plane could be detected by gaia . also the phenomenon of mesolensing @xcite could be used to gain information on possible planets at distances @xmath131 au .",
    "@xcite proposed to use the spectral distortion induced on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by putative distant masses to put constraints on the physical properties and distances of them .",
    "with the all - sky synoptic survey pan - starrs @xcite massive planets such as neptune would be undetectable through reflected sunlight beyond about 800 au , while a body with @xmath132 would be undetectable for @xmath133 au .    in conclusion ,",
    "the dynamical constraints on a still undiscovered planet x in the outer regions of the solar system we dynamically obtained from the orbital motions of the inner planets of the solar system with the extra - precessions of the perihelia estimated by pitjeva with the epm ephemerides are tighter than those obtained from pulsar timing data analysis and the outer planets dynamics ; moreover , they could be used in conjunction with the future planned all - sky surveys in the choice of the areas of the sky to be investigated .",
