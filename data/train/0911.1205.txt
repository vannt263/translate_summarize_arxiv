    "a definition of `` expansion of space '' and related statements from the literature are briefly discussed in [ s - expanding ] , and the notion of an expanding minkowski space - time is mentioned in [ s - expanding - mink ] .",
    "conclusions are presented in [ s - conclu ] .    for clarity",
    ", the terms `` hyperbolic '' and `` spherical '' are used for negatively and positively curved flrw models , respectively , rather than the ambiguous terms `` open '' and `` closed '' .",
    "the term `` galaxy '' is used for an external massless galaxy located at some non - zero distance from the observer in the covering space .",

    "it can also be thought of as a space - time geodesic ( e.g. the path of a photon ) projected to a comoving spatial section by ignoring the cosmological time coordinate .",

    "it can also be thought of as a tiling of euclidean 3-space , @xmath2 , called the `` covering space '' , @xmath3 , which can also be informally called the `` apparent space '' , since it contains many copies of any individual physical object .",
    "a mapping @xmath4 from one copy of the cube in @xmath3 to another copy is a ( non - arbitrary ) isometry of @xmath3 , i.e. it preserves metric distances , and is called a `` holonomy transformation '' .",

    "the comoving spatial section of an flrw model is a constant curvature 3-manifold whose curvature may be zero , positive or negative is chosen for consistency of the presentation .",
    "this relates to the physical characteristics of the three types of flrw spatial sections : negatively curved spaces are the least convenient for the problem dealt with in this paper ( see [ s - meth - neg ] ) . ] and whose topology ( @xmath9 homotopy group ) may be trivial or non - trivial @xcite .",
    "the curvature is related to the matter - energy density through the einstein field equations , since the flrw model constitutes a family of solutions to these equations .",

    "another way of thinking about the relation between the covering space @xmath3 and the 3-manifold @xmath5 itself is that if we populate @xmath5 by a set of massless galaxies , then @xmath3 can be thought of as the observer s _ apparent space _ containing multiple topological images of each galaxy . loosely speaking ,",
    "@xmath3 can be thought of as being tiled by a set of mirror copies of the fundamental domain of @xmath5 , except that instead of a reflection ( generated by a mirror ) , a holonomy transformation ( an isometry that allows @xmath3 to be completely and exactly tiled by copies of the fundamental domain of @xmath5 ) must be used .",

    "the location of the world - line of the copy of the observer in this diagram is ambiguous , as indicated by the question marks and discussed in the text ( [ s - results ] ) : how is it possible that the ( inertial ) observer is moving at constant speed away from herself in ( non - expanding ) minkowski space - time ? [ f - spacedopp ] , width=264 ]    figure  [ f - spacecomov ] shows the observer , the galaxy , the photon emitted by the latter and absorbed by the former , the copy of the observer , and the world - lines of the observer , galaxy and copy of the observer , according to the flrw model of spatial section @xmath5 , in the covering space @xmath3 in comoving coordinates .",
    "a copy of the observer is located at @xmath71 , i.e. at the same comoving position as the galaxy .",
    "since the observer is comoving , the copy of the observer is also comoving , so the copy of the observer and the galaxy are both comoving at the same spatial position .",
    "hence , the copy of the observer and the galaxy are at rest with respect to one another .    it was assumed above ( [ s - cos - top ] ) that the observer has been at rest in comoving coordinates since the epoch @xmath20 , so the copy of the observer has also been at rest in comoving coordinates since the epoch @xmath20 .",
    "hence , the copy of the observer s world - line is @xmath72 this includes the space - time event @xmath73 of the galaxy emitting the photons that are later on observed at @xmath74 .",
    "hence , we can consider the copy of the observer to have emitted photons at the same space - time event @xmath73 in the same direction as the photons emitted by the galaxy .",
    "it follows that if a doppler interpretation of the galaxy s redshift @xmath54 is attempted based on parallel transport of four - velocities along the photon path , leading to an inferred velocity @xmath75 [ eq .  ( [ e - doppler - z ] ) ]",
    ", then the same doppler interpretation implies that the copy of the observer at @xmath71 must also be inferred to be receding at velocity @xmath75 with respect to the `` original '' observer .",

    "the slope of any inertially moving object s world - line is constant and the slope defines the object s velocity relative to that of the observer .",
    "the slope of the observer s world - line is exactly vertical .",
    "a change of global topology does not change this @xcite .",
    "an inertial observer in a non - expanding minkowski space - time is moving at zero velocity with respect to herself .",
    "she can not recede at velocity @xmath75 from herself .",
    "since @xmath76 and @xmath77 , there is no peculiar velocity difference between the galaxy and the copy of the observer that could avoid this contradiction .",
    "figure  [ f - spacedopp ] shows the equivalent information with an attempt to support the doppler interpretation of the galaxy s redshift",
    ". the galaxy is receding at a doppler - inferred velocity of @xmath75 , so in a non - expanding minkowski space - time diagram labelled in units with @xmath78 , the galaxy must have a world - line at an angle of @xmath79 from the vertical . since @xmath76 and @xmath80 where @xmath27 is a comoving coordinate , equality must also hold in the minkowski diagram .",
    "that is , in fig .",
    "[ f - spacedopp ] , the copy of the observer must also be receding at @xmath75 from herself , i.e. must also have a world - line at an angle of @xmath79 from the vertical , that coincides exactly with the galaxy s world - line .",
    "however , the world - line of the galaxy and copy of the observer in fig .",
    "[ f - spacedopp ] are labelled with a question mark , since the observer must be stationary with respect to herself in a non - expanding minkowski space - time , i.e. the copy of the observer must have a _ vertical _ world - line .",
    "the latter is also indicated by a question mark in fig .",
    "[ f - spacedopp ] .",
    "the copy of the observer can not have two physically distinct world - lines .",
    "the doppler interpretation is clearly self - contradictory .",
    "the situation for spherical flrw models ( [ s - meth - pos ] ) is nearly the same as for flat flrw models , with the difference that the @xmath50-th copy of the observer is located arbitrarily close ( less than @xmath49 ) from the galaxy [ see eq.([e - def - mn ] ) ] , rather than exactly at the galaxy .",
    "the assumption that parallel transport of a four - velocity enables inference of a doppler recession velocity can be used to show that the velocity between the copy of the observer ( within @xmath49 of the galaxy ) and the galaxy itself can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "this is sufficient to show that the copy of the observer is receding at a speed @xmath81 arbitrarily close to @xmath75 , i.e. the observer is receding from herself at non - zero velocity @xmath82 .",
    "again this is impossible in a non - expanding minkowski space - time .      the hyperbolic flrw models ( [ s - meth - neg ] ) have a much more restrained domain where the doppler interpretation in non - expanding minkowski space - time fails . for simplicity , only galaxies at distances @xmath55 for an hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath5 are considered in this paper .",
    "for example , with @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , this requires @xmath85 .",
    "km / s / mpc@xmath86 .",
    "] given this restriction , the doppler interpretation of the redshift of the would - be massless extremely high redshift galaxy again leads to a contradiction : the observer must be receding with respect to herself , which is absurd unless an expanding space concept is introduced .",
    "in the flat case , the self - contradiction of the doppler interpretation is limited below in @xmath19 only by the requirement that @xmath19 be large enough that the ( massless ) galaxy be at rest in comoving coordinates .",
    "in an exact - flrw model , i.e. in the absence of density perturbations , there is no gravitational collapse of the cosmic web of filaments of large - scale structure , galaxies and clusters of galaxies , and no turnaround radius , so comoving `` galaxies '' exist arbitrarily close to the observer , at any distance @xmath87 . in this case , even with a `` galaxy '' at @xmath88 , the application of the holonomy transformation ( [ e - flat - gamma ] ) will still lead to a contradiction : the copy of the observer at the location of the comoving galaxy doppler - interpreted still recedes at velocity @xmath75 from herself .",
    "however , in reality , density perturbations certainly do exist , so the flrw model is certainly wrong .",
    "the standard ( formally inconsistent , but practical ) approach of using an flrw model together with perturbations implies a turnaround radius , so that the comoving coordinate system of the flrw model only makes physical sense for galaxies at comoving distances @xmath89  .",
    "hence , in a perturbed flrw model , the failure of the doppler interpretation of galaxy redshifts occurs only for @xmath90  , where @xmath91 is the comoving distance to the galaxy , i.e. for @xmath92 .",
    "the situation is similar for a perturbed spherical flrw model .",
    "again , there is some domain where the doppler interpretation of cosmological redshifts is valid , and it should no longer be possible to obtain @xmath37 arbitrarily small .",
    "an evaluation of the domain of parameter space where there would be no self - contradiction in the doppler interpretation of redshifts in non - expanding minkowski space - time in the perturbed spherical flrw case would require calculations that depend on @xmath93 the matter density parameter @xmath94 , the dark energy parameter / cosmological constant @xmath95 , and @xmath19 .",
    "for some parameter combinations sufficiently far from realistic estimates , even some redshifts @xmath92 might be interpreted as a parallel - transported relativistic doppler effect without leading to an observer receding from herself in a non - expanding minkowski space - time .",
    "on the other hand , in contrast with the flat and spherical cases , allowing perturbations in an hyperbolic flrw model should not avoid the self - contradiction of the doppler interpretation , since the possible `` galaxies '' chosen in this case are at very high redshifts .",
    "the requirement that an flrw model be perturbed in order for the doppler interpretation to be valid at small redshifts ( @xmath96 ) seems to be an implicit assumption in presentations such as sect .",
    "ii of @xcite . in a perfectly homogeneous flrw model with a massless police officer aiming a radar at a nearby massless , comoving , `` speeding '' car , the road itself is stretching and the local environment of the car is comoving with that car .",
    "the police officer can aim the radar at a building adjacent to the car and will infer that the building is also receding at a recklessly high speed , e.g. , 150 km / h .",
    "moreover , the driver can open his door and touch the road with his fingers , without any risk of injury , since both the car and the patch of road in the car s immediate neighbourhood are receding at 150 km / h . let us now quotient the space by a group of holonomy transformations as described above , without modifying the flrw nature of the model , and the police officer suddenly notices that it is he himself who , along with the patch of road , is receding at a speed of 150 km / h  from himself .",
    "he is reluctant to give himself a speeding ticket , since he is convinced of his innocence  he is stationary with respect to his local surroundings .",
    "he decides that there is something unphysical about interpreting the redshift as a velocity , and concludes that space itself is small and expanding .",
    "this analogy seems strange because roads are normally of fixed length in `` physical '' units . for this to be possible , density perturbations and gravitational collapse to structures that stabilise in physical spatial coordinates",
    "must be added to the model .",
    "if perturbations are added , then small , local regions that are _ not _ comoving are created . however , in an exact - flrw model of zero or positive curvature , the contradiction as derived above occurs , no matter how small the length scale , since `` galaxies '' at arbitrarily small distances are comoving in this idealised model .        @xcite clarify the notion of expanding space by defining it as the physical situation where `` the distance between observers at rest with respect to the fluid increases with time '' . using standard flrw notation , an equivalent , but more compact definition of ``",
    "expanding space '' is :    `` expanding space '' means @xmath99 .",
    "[ d - eos ]    @xcite introduces the terminology `` expansion of the cosmic substratum '' for this flrw notion of expanding space .",
    "the expansion of space becomes even clearer when @xcite s statement that `` undoubtedly space is expanding '' in the spherical case and @xcite s equivalent statement that `` the proper volume of a [ spherical ] fl universe increases as @xmath100 ^ 3 $ ] ; more and more space thus appears '' are extended to early twentieth - century results @xcite regarding the role of the topology of the 3-spatial section of the universe as a property to be determined by observations .",
    "the latter approach leads to the present - day understanding of 3-manifolds , according to which a flat or hyperbolic flrw universe can have a finite spatial section , i.e. there is no physical reason why a realisation of a constant curvature 3-manifold should be simply connected .",
    "hence , peacock s and chodorowski s statements can be updated in the spirit of de  sitter , friedmann , lematre and robertson : _ space is expanding in a compact flrw model of zero , positive , or negative curvature during epochs when @xmath101 .",
    "_    in other words , peacock and chodorowski agree that it is natural to see finite flrw models as ( globally ) expanding , and it is hard to imagine any physical reason why this should apply only to finite spherical flrw models and not to finite flat and hyperbolic flrw models .",
    "the notion of expanding space in infinite models , e.g. the simply - connected non - positively curved models , is more difficult to conceive of globally , since @xmath102 and even in typical extensions of @xmath39 that include @xmath103 , the expression @xmath104 is usually undefined . on the other hand , a local concept of expanding space , where `` local '' means any finite ( greater than zero ) region of the comoving spatial section , i.e. a region attached to a framework of galaxies , gives a notion of expanding space .",
    "such a region expands as @xmath105 when @xmath106 .",
    "the condition that every finite ( greater than zero ) region should satisfy this in a non - compact exact - flrw model provides an intuitive way of understanding defn  [ d - eos ] in the case of an infinite comoving space .",
    "a minor caveat is that in order to avoid ambiguity , in an almost - flrw model , this use of `` local '' would have to be distinguished from the even more local concept of regions smaller than the turnaround radius .    nevertheless , it is the finite models ( or , at least , models that are compact in at least one direction ) that are the most interesting not only for extending the concept of expanding space as presented by peacock and chodorowski , but also for providing the holonomy transformations used above to lead to the contradiction of an inertial observer receding from herself .",
    "although quotienting a minkowski space - time by a group of spatial holonomy transformations at constant time for a preferred inertial observer retains the common sense physical notion that an inertial observer is not moving with respect to herself @xcite , it is possible to add the notion of expanding space to a minkowski space - time in order to make it an `` expanding space - time '' @xcite . in this case",
    ", an observer _ can _ have a non - zero velocity with respect to herself .",
    "hence , ironically in the context of the recent debate , parallel - transport of four - velocities along photon paths _ can _ allow cosmological redshifts to be interpreted as a relativistic doppler effect without the contradiction presented here ,",
    "_ provided that the concept of expanding space is added to the minkowski space - time used for this interpretation , _ and provided that the velocity is thought of as being tied to a path and not as a global concept .      in order to avoid the contradiction in the doppler interpretation of galaxy redshifts in non - expanding minkowski space - time as presented here , would it be sufficient to consider a limited spatial region within an flrw model , or to consider flrw models whose spatial sections are simply - connected ( where every closed loop is continuously contractible to a point ) ?",
    "the former would be sufficient to avoid the contradiction , if defined appropriately .",
    "if the galaxy of interest in a specific flrw model is closer to the observer than twice the injectivity radius , i.e. @xmath56 , then by the definition of the injectivity radius , a closed spatial loop can not occur .",
    "nevertheless , given the present empirical estimates of the metric parameters of the concordance model , even the most restrictive of the three curvatures , i.e. the hyperbolic case , would still imply a contradiction that could be applicable to the earliest galaxy building blocks .",
    "for example , with @xmath107 , and the hyperbolic flrw spatial section v@xmath108 @xcite , which has @xmath109 , the comoving length of the shortest closed spatial geodesic would be about 6364 , so that it would be possible for a closed loop from the observer to herself at @xmath110 to occur , if she is appropriately positioned .",
    "the latter possibility would partially avoid the contradiction , by making the link between global spatial topology and the doppler interpretation explicit as a case to exclude .",
    "the simply - connected spherical case would also require a domain restriction , depending on the values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 and the epoch of the observer , since as the universe recollapses , a cosmological time can occur when the observer sees a distant ( blueshifted ) copy of herself approaching .",
    "however , in either case , the apparent simplicity of the doppler interpretation in non - expanding minkowski space - time would be complicated by adding the global - topology related exclusion .",
    "cosmic topology is not just a luxury referred to by de  sitter , friedmann , lematre and robertson ( and * ? ? ?",
    "* in the pre - relativistic era ) .",
    "apart from providing a competitor to the infinite flat model for understanding wmap observational data , cosmic topology can also help to improve physical insight into fundamentals of flrw models that initially appear to be unrelated to global topology .",
    "if the parallel - transported four - velocity doppler interpretation of galaxy redshifts depends only on the metric ( including @xmath113 ) , then it leads to the physical contradiction of an inertial observer in a non - expanding minkowski space - time receding from herself .",
    "this contradiction can be resolved , but only at the cost of introducing the notion of expanding space , in which case the motivation for a doppler interpretation is weakened , or by explicitly stating that the comoving distance to the galaxy must be less than twice the injectivity radius of comovinig space .",
    "the link between the doppler interpretation of redshifts and cosmic topology can be summarised physically as follows .",
    "( )    the relativistic doppler interpretation of a cosmological redshift is obtained by parallel transporting the emitting galaxy s four - velocity along a photon path to the observer .     for an flrw model of any of the three curvatures ( with the restrictions as detailed above ) ,",
    "the comoving spatial geodesic of the photon s path can be considered to be a closed path by changing from a simply - connected flrw model to a multiply - connected flrw model , without any modification of the metric .",
    "this should not affect the doppler interpretation if that interpretation depends only on the metric .",
    "closed comoving spatial paths constitute the mathematical foundation of cosmic topology ( e.g. , 3.4 , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , it is unsurprising that insistence on the possibility of interpreting galaxy redshifts as a relativistic doppler effect leads to the properties of cosmic topology , and in turn requires the physical concept of expanding space , i.e. epochs when @xmath106 ( defn  [ d - eos ] ) .",
