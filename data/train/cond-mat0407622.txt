    "lattice models are the basic instrument in the study of phase transitions in equilibrium statistical mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ising model is the simplest model of nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interactions where the collective features are studied .",
    "traditionally , the phase transition has been considered in regular lattices . according to the renormalization group theory , detailed structure of interactions as well as the structure of network connections are irrelevant .",
    "therefore , for example , cellular automata have been continuously tested with the hope that these systems can imitate nature @xcite .",
    "if the cellular automata are considered on a regular lattice and each site @xmath0 of the lattice is occupied by a binary variable , @xmath1 , which assumes the values @xmath2 , then referring to these variables as _ spins _ which point either ` up ' ( @xmath3 ) or ` down ' ( @xmath4 ) , we employ the terminology of the ising model . the ising nearest - neighbor interaction in case of cellular automata becomes usually a simple majority rule , it is : if most of the nearest neighbors of @xmath0 spin point up ( down ) at time @xmath5 then the value of the @xmath0 spin at time @xmath6 is up ( down ) .",
    "this deterministic rule is interpreted as the zero - temperature approximation to the ising interactions .",
    "the research here is aimed on the ergodicity , i.e. , on the uniqueness of the final state .",
    "especially , one asks if starting from a random distribution of spins states one ends up with a homogeneous states of _ all spins up _ or _ all spins down_. to mimic the temperature effects one adds a stochastic noise to perturb with some probability the execution of the deterministic dynamics .",
    "the research here is focused on properties of the transition from the non - ordered phase to the ordered phase - ferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "recent research in the structure and topology of real networks @xcite has shown that social , biological , technological networks are far from being regular . however , they also are being far from a random network .",
    "it has been shown that networks called _ small - world _ networks and _ scale - free _ networks exhibit mixed properties of regular lattices and a random graph @xcite .",
    "this has trigged to study of standard models of statistical mechanics in these networks .",
    "the transition from non - ordered phase to the ordered phase in the spin system spanned on the small - world network shows a change in behavior from the regular case to the mean - field characteristics @xcite .",
    "interesting that , depending on the network construction , the phase transition at the finite temperature exists or not @xcite .",
    "moreover , when the scale - free network is employed then the critical properties of the ising model are different from those ones observed in the regular networks @xcite .",
    "many authors have considered other problems in these new networks : percolation properties @xcite , the spread of infection diseases @xcite social relations @xcite , computer organization @xcite .",
    "small - world networks are intermediates between regular lattices and the random graph . a small - world network is generated by rewiring with a probability @xmath7 the links of a regular lattice by long - distance random links @xcite .",
    "the presence of a small fraction of ` short - cuts ' connecting otherwise distant points , drastically reduces the average shortest distance between any pair of nodes in network .    in case of cellular automata",
    "such the small - world network means that the cellular automata is no longer homogeneous  inhomogeneity is due to the topology",
    ". sets of nearest - neighbors differ from a site to a site .",
    "there is one important property which is ubiquitous in biological and artificial networks and which is missed in the small - world network  the distribution of the vertex degree does not show wings decaying as a power - law .",
    "two important ingredients have been shown to be sufficient to generate such feature : growing number of vertices and preferential attachment of links .",
    "the well established barabasi - albert model based on these two mechanisms has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the distributions of the vertex degree in this network is of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 a vertex degree . thus adapting the barabasi - albert idea to cellular automata one obtains a computing system with the topology that evolves .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of the role played by the topology in the zero - temperature ferromagnetic transition considered in the cellular automata of spins .",
    "the starting system is the cellular automata on a square lattice .",
    "the square lattice used here is strongly clustered in the sense that if @xmath11 and @xmath10 are neighbors of @xmath0 then there is a short path between them that does not pass through @xmath0 . in order to keep the high clustered property ( typical for the small - world network ) and reproduce the distribution of the vertex degree with the power - low decay ( sign of the scale - free network ) we propose the evolution rule for the network .",
    "hence , the cellular automata time step means the change of the spin states and the change of the network topology .",
    "it will be shown that with increasing @xmath7- the rewiring parameter , the cellular automata work as the solver to the _ density classification task _ @xcite , highly accurately , namely our cellular automata converge to a fixed point of all 1 s if the initial configuration contains more 1 s than -1 s by 2% , and , symmetrically , to a fixed point of all -1 s if the initial configuration contains more -1 s than 1 s by 2% .",
    "we present the model of the spin cellular automata located in @xmath12 vertices among which there is an explicit integer parameter @xmath13 fixing the total number of edges .",
    "these @xmath12 spins are located to form a square lattice with the periodic boundary conditions . hence ,",
    "if the linear size of the lattice is @xmath14 then @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we start with the ordinary nearest - neighbor relations , i.e. , for any @xmath0 site the nearest - neighbor spins are located in the following set of vertex indices : @xmath17 .",
    "initially , each spin state is set up randomly with the probability @xmath18 .",
    "the evolution step consists of the two subsequent steps : ( a ) the asynchronous stochastic evolution of topological relations and ( b ) the synchronous deterministic majority rule .      in each time - step @xmath5 and for each vertex",
    "@xmath0 the following rearrangement of the edges is performed : from the set of neighbors @xmath19 of the vertex @xmath0 ( at the given time @xmath5 ) one element @xmath11 is chosen at random with the probability @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath7 relates to the parameter of the small - world evolution @xcite .",
    "then , another vertex @xmath10 is picked up from the set of all vertices @xmath20 randomly .",
    "a new edge is created between @xmath0 and @xmath10 independently of the fact that there was or not an edge between them .",
    "the edge between @xmath0 and @xmath11 is deleted .",
    "hence the total number of edges @xmath13 is conserved . this evolution",
    "we will call stochastic on the contrary to the evolution in which some preferences are applied .",
    "the proposed preferences are in the agreement with the basic conviction how to obtain a scale free distribution for the vertex degree :  the richer you are , the richer you get   principle @xcite .",
    "the preferences are as follows : in each time step @xmath5 and for each vertex @xmath0 , from the set of neighbors @xmath19 an element @xmath11 is chosen with the probability modified by the degree of @xmath11 vertex . namely , the probability that @xmath11 neighbor is unlinked is @xmath21 \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the degree of @xmath11 vertex , @xmath23 denotes the value of the unlink threshold .",
    "the degree of a vertex denotes the number of edges attached to the vertex . by ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "if @xmath24 then it is impossible to unlink @xmath11 . this process will be called the intensional detachment . the edge between @xmath0 and @xmath11",
    "is deleted . then a new vertex is randomly chosen but with the preference to link to a vertex with the high vertex degree .",
    "it is , a randomly picked up vertex @xmath10 is accepted with probability @xmath25 thus if @xmath26 then randomly chosen @xmath10 is certainly accepted .",
    "this process will be called the preferential attachment .    in the following we will name : + _ model 0",
    "_ : the completely stochastic edge evolution , + _ model 1 _ : the intensional detachment and the stochastic attachment , + _ model 2 _ : the stochastic detachment and the preferential attachment , + _ model 3 _ : the intensional detachment and the preferential attachment .",
    "synchronously , in each time step , the majority rule is applied to set the state of every spin in the next time - step .",
    "the rule acts on all spins belonging to the the set of nearest neighbors @xmath19 of the given @xmath0th spin . in the case when the result of voting is zero , the @xmath0th spin does not change the state .",
    "the system simulated is a square lattice with @xmath27 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we start with a random distribution of spin states with probability @xmath18 to set the spin state to @xmath3 . in each time step",
    "we measure _ magnetization _  the sum of all spins states normalized by @xmath28 .",
    "if the magnetization is @xmath29 or the time step reaches the limit of the hundredth step , then we stop the evolution and record the following characteristics : magnetization , susceptibility ( the variation of the magnetization ) , vertex degree and number of time steps to reach the stable state .",
    "the experiment is repeated 200 times for each @xmath7 and @xmath18 value .",

    "depending on the model of the network evolution this transformation goes fast : model 0 , or less rapidly : model 3 .",
    "the transformation can be estimated by measuring the intervals of @xmath18 around the 0.5- value which lead to the final states with with magnetization close to @xmath2 , see fig.1 .",
    "more accurate marks for these intervals can be found by observing susceptibility , see fig.2 . in case of unperturbed network ( @xmath37 ) the susceptibility takes the parabola - like shape on the log - plots . with increasing @xmath7",
    "the suscpetibility becomes the sharply pointed curve with maximum at @xmath38 .",
    "the basic step in @xmath18 in the experiments performed is @xmath39 .",
    "therefore the peaks of susceptibilities are recognized within the interval @xmath40 . in the small windows of fig.2",

    "the significant qualitative change occurs when @xmath7 changes from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , if one assumes that the interval of critical changes means the susceptibility greater than 1 ( at average this condition is equivalent to the demand of the absolute magnetization being smaller than @xmath43 ) , then one finds : +  @xmath44 in case of cellular automata without the network evolution +  @xmath45 in case of cellular automata with the network evolving according to the rules of models 0,1,2 +  @xmath46 in case of cellular automata with the network evolving according to the rule of model 3 .",
    "+ because of the observed rapid changes in main characteristics one can say that the cellular automata solve the density classification task .",
    "especially , model 0 solves the density classification problem extremely efficiently : quickly and with the high certainty .    also",
    "time needed to reach the fixed point stabilization changes when @xmath7 is increasing . if @xmath47 and @xmath48 then the time to stabilization is larger than in case of the system with not evolving network .",

    "the properties shown in figures collect features found as snap - shots of cellular automata states at the one hundredth step .",
    "this limitation does not introduce any important restriction .",
    "it is because that when the network does not evolve then , due to the many invariants of the spin - state rule , one observes the stabilizations on configurations which oscillate with some time period .",
    "this results in that the stabilization time is read as @xmath51 .",
    "such limit configurations occur also if @xmath7 is small , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "when the rewiring process is stronger the oscillating patterns disappear in less than 100 steps .",
    "the stabilization different from the fixed points is not observed if @xmath52 .",
    "the vertex degree distributions are presented in fig.[degree ] .",
    "the plots collect results recorded when the cellular automata systems arrive to the limit of either a ferro fixed point stabilization or a hundred step of time .",
    "hence the total number of changes in the network depends on the time given to the evolution .",
    "however , if @xmath53 then after a hundredth steps the average probability for an edge to change is 1 .",
    "thus , the difference between a network state after a hundred steps with @xmath41 and after the first step with @xmath54 consists in the synchronousness of events : with increasing @xmath7 the edge evolution becomes more synchronous .",

    "the strong connectivity arisen from the small - world network enhances sharply the solution .",
    "the cellular automata considered are ergodic outside the interval @xmath61 what means that the interval of ergodicity is definitely larger than the interval of @xmath18 in case of the ordinary spin cellular automata",
    ". therefore we claim that the systems considered can work as solvers of the density task . moreover , since the analysed properties have been collected at time moments much smaller than the system size , the stated features seem to be universal in the sense that they are size independent .",
    "our work is only preliminary .",
    "the dynamical system considered here needs further investigations .",
    "we have studied the zero - temperature ising problem .",

    "moreover , the networks considered here can bee included into the one thermodynamic ensemble , so - called canonical ensemble , because all networks have the same number of edges @xcite . for the canonical ensemble",
    "there is a possibility to fix a temperature and associate the energy to every network configuration .",
