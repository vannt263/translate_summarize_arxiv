    ", any iterative quantum procedure _ has _ to be a continuos rotation in state space . in the original quantum search algorithm",
    ", the state vector uniformly goes from the initial to the target and unless we stop when it is right at the target , it will drift away . for many applications , including unsorted database search ,",
    "this leads to a square - root speedup over the corresponding classical algorithm .",
    "one limitation of these algorithms is that , to perform optimally , they need precise knowledge of certain problem parameters , e.g. the number of target states .    in this paper we show that by replacing the selective phase inversions in quantum search by suitable phase shifts we can get an algorithm that always gives an improvement .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , when a single iteration derived from any unitary operator @xmath3 is applied , the state vector",
    "_ always _ moves closer to the target state ( section 3 ) . by recurring this basic iteration",
    ", we develop an algorithm with multiple applications of @xmath4 that converge monotonically to the target ( section 4 ) .",
    "this leads to variants of quantum searching that are robust to changes in the parameters ( section 5 ) .",
    "also , this immediately leads to schemes for reducing certain kinds of errors in quantum computing ( section 6 ) .",

    "consider the following transformation @xmath5 @xmath6 & @xmath7 denote selective phase shifts of the respective state(s ) by @xmath8 note that if we were to change these phase shifts from @xmath9 to @xmath10  we would get one iteration of the amplitude amplification algorithm @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the next section shows that if the @xmath3 operation drives the state vector from a source @xmath11 to a target @xmath12 state with a probability of @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 , then the transformation ( [ transf ] ) drives the state vector from the source to the same target state with a probability of @xmath15 the deviation from the @xmath16 state has hence fallen from @xmath17  to @xmath18 .",
    "the striking aspect of this result is that it holds for _ any _ kind of deviation from the @xmath16  state . unlike the standard amplitude amplification algorithm which would overshoot the target state when @xmath17 is small ( figure 1 ) ; the new algorithm will always move towards the target . as shown in section 5 ,",
    "this can be used to develop algorithms that are more robust to variations in the problem parameters .",
    "connections to error correction might already be evident in the previous paragraph .",
    "let us say that we are trying to drive a system from an @xmath19  to a @xmath16  state / subspace .",
    "the transformation that we have available for this is @xmath20 which drives it from @xmath19  to @xmath16  with a probability @xmath21 of @xmath22 i.e. the probability of error in this transformation is @xmath17 .",
    "then the composite transformation @xmath23  will reduce the error to @xmath24    this technique is applicable whenever the transformations @xmath25 can be implemented .",
    "this will be the case when errors are systematic errors or slowly varying errors , e.g. due to environmental degradation of some component .",
    "this would not apply to errors that come about as a result of sudden disturbances from the environment .",
    "it is further assumed that the transformation @xmath3 can be inverted with exactly the same error ( illustrated in section 6 ) .",
    "traditionally quantum error correction is carried out at the single qubit level where individual errors are corrected , each error being corrected in a separate way . with the machinery of this paper , errors can be corrected without ever needing to identify the error syndrome .",
    "we analyze the effect of the transformation @xmath23 when it is applied to the @xmath26 state .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , @xmath6 & @xmath7 denote selective phase shifts of the respective state(s ) by @xmath9 ( @xmath16 for target , @xmath19 for source ) .",
    "we show that if @xmath27 then @xmath28    in the rest of this section , the greek alphabet @xmath29 will be used to denote @xmath8 start with @xmath26 and apply the operations @xmath30 & @xmath31 if we analyze the effect of the operations , one by one , just as in the original quantum search algorithm @xcite , we find that it leads to the following superposition:@xmath32    to estimate the deviation of this superposition from @xmath33 , consider the amplitude of the above superposition in non - target states .",
    "the probability is given by the absolute square of the corresponding amplitude:@xmath34    substituting @xmath27 the above quantity becomes@xmath35@xmath36 the following sections give two simple applications of the above analysis - the first to searching in the presence of uncertainty and the second to error correction .",
    "a few years after the invention of the quantum search algorithm @xcite , @xcite it was generalized to a much larger class of applications known as the amplitude amplification algorithms @xcite , @xcite . in these algorithms , the amplitude produced in a particular state @xmath16 by starting from a state",
    "@xmath19  and applying a unitary operation @xmath3 , can be _ amplified _ by successively repeating the sequence of operations :  @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 denote selective inversions of the @xmath39 states respectively . for later reference , note that the amplitude amplification transformation with four queries is:@xmath40 if we start from the @xmath19 state and repeat the operation sequence @xmath41 @xmath42 times , then the amplitude in the @xmath43 state becomes approximately 2@xmath44 provided @xmath45 . the quantum search algorithm is a particular case of amplitude amplification with @xmath3 being the walsh - hadamard transformation ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath19 being the @xmath47 state ( state of the system with all qubits in the @xmath48 state ) . the selective inversions enable the amplitudes produced in the various iterations to add up in phase .",
    "the amount of amplification increases linearly with the number of repetitions of @xmath49 and hence the probability of detecting @xmath16 goes up quadratically .    just like the amplitude amplification transformation , it is possible to recurs the transformation @xmath23",
    "@xmath26 to obtain larger rotations of the state vector in a carefully - defined two dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this recursion will be described in detail in @xcite , the basic idea is to define transformations @xmath50 by the recursion : @xmath51 unlike amplitude amplification , it is _ not _ simple to write down the precise operation sequence for @xmath50 with large @xmath52 without working out the full recursion for all integers less than @xmath52 .",
    "recursion for each @xmath52 is different and there is no simple structure .",
    "let us illustrate this for @xmath53 : @xmath54@xmath55@xmath56 the corresponding transformation for amplitude amplification is (  [ ampt - amp ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 .",
    "expressed as a function of the number of queries ( @xmath59 ) @xmath60the failure probability hence falls as @xmath61 after @xmath59  queries @xcite ; this is similar to a classical algorithm where the probability of failure falls as @xmath62 after @xmath63 queries ( a classical algorithm is discussed in section 5 ) .",
    "first , note that the standard amplitude amplification algorithm ( [ ampt - amp ] ) and the phase shift algorithm ( [ recursion3 ] ) , both have some selective operations performed on the t - state and so from an information theoretic point of view there is no violation in having fixed points .",
    "however , unitarity would be violated if there was any kind of accumulation at the target state due to repetition of the same transformation . in amplitude amplification ( [ ampt - amp ] ) , exactly the same transformation is repeated and so unitarity does not permit any fixed point . in the phase shift algorithm ( [ recursion3 ] ) , which is very similar to amplitude amplification ,",
    "the transformation repeated in each step is slightly different due to the presence of each of the four operations @xmath64 and it hence gets around the unitarity condition that prevents amplitude amplification from having a fixed point .",
    "the original quantum search algorithm is known to be the best possible algorithm for exhaustive searching @xcite , @xcite therefore no algorithm will be able to improve its performance . however , for applications other than exhaustive searching for a single item , this paper demonstrates that suitably modified algorithms may indeed provide better performance .",
    "consider the situation where a large fraction of the states are marked , but the precise fraction of marked states is not known .",
    "the goal is to find a single marked state with as high a probability as possible in a single query . for concreteness ,",
    "say some unknown fraction , @xmath65 , of the states are marked , with @xmath65 uniformly distributed  between 75% and 100% with equal probability .    in the following",
    "we show that the probability of failure for the new scheme is approximately one fourth that of the best ( possible ) classical scheme . also , it is approximately one fourth of that of the best ( known ) quantum scheme .    [ [ classical ] ] classical + + + + + + + + +    the best classical algorithm is to select a random state and see if it is a @xmath16  state ( one query ) . if yes , return this state ; if not , pick another random state and return that .",
    "the probability of failure is equal to that of not getting a single @xmath16  state in two random picks , i.e. @xmath66 which lies in the range @xmath67 .",
    "the overall failure probability is approximately 3.12@xmath68 .",

    "this finds a solution with a probability of @xmath69 where @xmath63 = number of queries and @xmath70 ( equation ( 59 ) from @xcite)@xmath71 when @xmath72 the success probability becomes : @xmath73 this lies in the range : @xmath74 .",

    "the overall failure probability is approximately 0.8@xmath83    [ ptb ]    comparison__3.eps    the performance of the algorithm is graphically illustrated in figure 3(a ) . in the region of interest of this problem ,",
    "the graph of the phase shift algorithm lies entirely above that of the graph of @xcite  everywhere and so the averaged success probability of the phase shift algorithm will clearly be higher .",
    "the difference in the two becomes even more dramatic if we consider multiple query algorithms ( figure 3(b ) ) .    in @xcite",
    ", it will be shown that the phase - shift algorithm of this paper , for the type of problems discussed in this section , is the best possible quantum algorithm asymptotically .",
    "von neumann observed in 1944 that if a certain module had an error probability of @xmath84 then the error probability  due to this module can be reduced by doing the computation just three times and  then deciding which state occurs most often in the output @xcite . assuming a perfect vote ,",
    "the error probability of the modified scheme is @xmath85 the approach of von neumann is still intact - add a small amount of redundancy to the circuit by means of which one can infer whether or not the solution is correct .",
    "if incorrect , redo the computation .",
    "however , in quantum circuits , this approach does not work in the above form due to the different nature of quantum information .",
    "it is not possible to observe quantum information without affecting it .",
    "remarkably , in 1996 peter shor &  andrew steane @xcite independently discovered that it was possible to correct small errors in quantum information even within the limitation of the above rules .",
    "they both did this by encoding each qubit into multiple qubits in a way that as long as the error affected any single qubit , it got projected into an orthogonal subspace where it could be identified and corrected .",
    "so the principle was established - quantum error correction was possible .",
    "unfortunately , the error correction provisions are very demanding and considerably increase the complexity of the circuit",
    ". there have been several schemes proposed for quantum error correction .",
    "most schemes have the limitation that they require the error per gate to be very small ( of the order of @xmath86 ) and/or require a large number of gates .",
    "this paper presents a new scheme based on the quantum search algorithm that can be used in conjunction with other schemes to reduce systematic errors .",
    "let us say that we want to implement a certain transformation @xmath3 to drive the system into a @xmath16  state ( or subspace ) with certainty .",
    "however , when @xmath3 is applied to the starting state s , the probability of reaching @xmath16  is only @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath3 produces an error of @xmath17 . just like",
    "von neumann had observed for classical circuits , we show that by doing the transformation @xmath3 three times , we can considerably reduce the error .",
    "however , the similarity ends there - the implementation and the error correction technique is very different from classical .",
    "the analysis of section 3 shows that if we can apply the composite operation @xmath87 , then , by a suitable choice of @xmath88 we can reduce the error from @xmath17  to @xmath24 this implementation thus depends on our ability to efficiently apply the operations @xmath89    the operation @xmath3  is the one being corrected and we assume that we can apply it two times just as easily . since quantum gates are reversible , we assume that we can also apply @xmath90 as easily ( note that this must reuse the same or very similar hardware as what @xmath3 did so as to keep the error exactly the same ) . for systematic errors and slowly varying random errors ,",
    "this can probably be achieved since we may assume that the circuit parameters stay fixed in time .",
    "@xmath91 require us to selectively shift the phases of certain states .",
    "shifting the phase of a state is as easy as identifying the presence of the state ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this leads to a number of different error - correction schemes , depending on the type of error to be corrected .",
    "to summarize , the error - correction technique requires the following conditions to be satisfied :    1 .   in case",
    "we are correcting errors in a transformation , @xmath3 , we should be able to apply @xmath3  twice and @xmath90 once .",
    "these transformations must be applied with exactly the same error as in the original @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   we should have a sub - module to distinguish the signal part of the output wavefunction from the error .",
    "this is necessary to carry out @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we assume the ability to perform noiseless @xmath6 & @xmath7 operations .",
    "the forthcoming paper @xcite , shows in detail how the methodology of this paper can be used to design elementary ( one &  two qubit gates ) that perform precisely even in the presence of small errors in @xmath91 .",
    "we illustrate this error - correction procedure with a simple example . consider the problem of transmitting classical information over a quantum channel .",
    "although the channel is quantum , the information of interest is classical .",
    "therefore the only portion of the errors that are of concern are the amplitude errors ( i.e. bit - flip errors ) , we do not care about the phase .",
    "it is well - known that by adding a single parity bit , we will be able to identify the presence of single bit - flip errors . to correct",
    "these would normally require additional bits . by making use of the error correction scheme of this paper ,",
    "we show how to _ correct _ single bit - flip errors using just a single parity qubit .",
    "parity__4.eps + figure 4 - redundancy , in the form of a parity bit , helps to detect , and _ correct _ , single bit - flip errors .      1 .",
    "the input and output registers have a provision for conditionally shifting the phase of the state of qubits by @xmath8 2 .",
    "the modulator flips the state of certain qubits depending on the message to be transmitted .",
    "3 .   there are two parity generators that take as input ( @xmath42 + 1 ) qubits .",
    "@xmath42 of these go on straight to the output , the ( @xmath42 + 1)@xmath92 qubit is replaced by the parity of the ( @xmath42 + 1 ) input qubits .",
    "the above components provide the blocks that can be used to implement the operations @xmath93 and thus the transformation @xmath94      1 .",
    "the input register is initialized with all @xmath95 qubits in the 0 state , one of these is the ancilla qubit .",
    "these are sent to the modulator which flips certain qubits depending on the message to be transmitted .",
    "the ( first ) parity generator computes a parity qubit and then transmits the ( @xmath42 + 1 ) qubits through the channel .",
    "all this is the transformation @xmath96 2 .   at the receiving end",
    ", the other parity generator computes the parity of the ( @xmath42 + 1 ) qubits and then sends the first @xmath42 of these into the output register and the ( @xmath42 + 1)@xmath92 ( parity ) qubit into the control signal of the output register .",
    "this is the @xmath6 phase shift .",
    "3 .   @xmath97 follows by propagating the qubits backward all the way from the output register , through the parity generator , channel , parity generator , modulator , all the way to the input register .",
    "the input register conditionally shifts the phase if all qubits are in the 0 state thus implementing @xmath98 .",
    "5 .   finally the signal is propagated from the input register to the output register again as in step 1 ( this constitutes application of the last @xmath3 in the transformation @xmath99 )    note that when classical information is being transmitted , one parity bit would normally provide the means just to detect single bit - flip errors .",
    "the quantum nature of the scheme enables us to _ correct _ the error without using any additional qubits .",
    "the variant of quantum searching discussed in this paper supplements the original search algorithm by providing a scheme that permits a fixed point and hence moves towards a target state in a more directed way .",
    "this new scheme has already led to a robust quantum scheme for quantum searching that is within a constant factor of the most efficient possible .",
    "this will be discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite,@xcite .",
    "also it naturally leads to schemes for error correction .",
    "this paper mentions an elementary example ; a comprehensive scheme is given in @xcite ,  where it is shown how to eliminate errors module by module .",
    "other schemes are under development .",
    "one missing aspect is a simple physical explanation of  how this scheme actually works . why does changing the @xmath100  phase shift in amplitude amplification to a @xmath9  phase shift ,",
    "convert the algorithm into something so different ?",
    "it would be insightful to have an explanation similar to those for amplitude amplification .",
