    "0 the aim of this paper is to investigate the properties of the finite - temperature ( ft ) effective potential of the gauge models in the de sitter space .",
    "the temperature @xmath7 is introduced as the temperature of quantum fields which are in thermal equilibrium in the static de sitter coordinates .",
    "thus , the corresponding quantum state is determined by the green function which is periodical along the time coordinate of the static frame with period @xmath8 .",
    "this enables one to use the euclidean formulation of the theory .",
    "in particular , one can define the partition function @xmath9 for arbitrary @xmath10 as a functional integral , where the fields configurations belong to the spherical domain @xmath11 with conical singularities on the euclidean horizon .",
    "there are at least two motivations for this work .",
    "the first one is to obtain the one - loop effective potential on such non - trivial spaces like @xmath11 in an analytical form .",
    "this is a continuation of the pioneering studies by shore @xcite and allen @xcite which investigated the effective actions on hyperspheres @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the paper extends the results of ref.@xcite concerning the scalar fields , to more interesting gauge models with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "a second motivation is related to the possible application of these results to cosmological problems since the exponentially expanding phase of the early universe @xcite is described by the de sitter geometry .",
    "our analysis has become possible after the spectrum of vector laplacians on singular @xmath13-spheres has been found explicitly in ref.@xcite .    in this paper a special attention is paid to calculation and comparison of the effective potentials for two physically relevant quantum states : the de sitter invariant ( dsi ) and the zero - temperature ( zt ) states .",
    "they both can be considered as possible vacua in quantum field theory in the de sitter space .",
    "the dsi state resembles the poincar invariant vacuum of the minkowski space - time since it preserves the symmetry of the de sitter space .",
    "the corresponding temperature is equal to @xmath14 , where @xmath1 denotes the de sitter radius @xcite and the euclidean section of the de sitter space is the hypersphere @xmath12 . in analogy with black hole physics this temperature",
    "can be called the hawking temperature . in the gibbons",
    " hawking path integral @xcite the euclidean gravitational action with a positive cosmological constant has the extremum on a 4sphere @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the choice of dsi state has a natural explanation in the semi - classical treatment of the quantum cosmology .",
    "for this reason the one - loop effective action for quantum fields on @xmath12 has been studied in a number of works @xcite-@xcite , @xcite . in particular , some authors @xcite investigated the phase structure of the gut models with respect to the value of the de sitter radius @xmath1 .    the dsi vacuum is analogous to the hartle  hawking vacuum @xcite introduced for quantum fields around an eternal black hole . from this point of view",
    "the zero  temperature state ( @xmath15 ) in the de sitter space is analogous to the boulware vacuum @xcite .",
    "the properties of this state are much less investigated , and we use here the explicit expressions of the effective potential to see how the choice of the vacuum affects the phase structure of the gauge theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly discuss in section 2 why the euclidean functional integral on the spherical domains @xmath11 can be interpreted as a partition function in the static de sitter space .",
    "the ft effective potential for gauge models is computed with the @xmath0function method in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we compare the symmetry breaking mechanisms at different values of @xmath1 in the two vacua for models of scalar electrodynamics .",
    "summary of the results is given in section 5 .",
    "technical details concerning the derivation of the @xmath0function are left for appendix .",
    "0 in the static coordinates the line element of the de sitter space with radius @xmath1 can be written in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the above coordinates ( [ ii.1 ] ) cover only a part of the space .",
    "one can consider a killing vector field generating a one  parameter group of isometries , subgroup of so(1,4 )",
    ". then coordinates ( [ ii.1 ] ) can be related to the time  like part of the killing field associated with the translations along the time @xmath20 .",
    "this region is restricted by the killing horizon where the killing field is null .",
    "it also coincides with the event horizon for the observers with coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be a scalar green function in the de sitter space - time for dsi state ( its some explicit expressions can be found in @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "this function is periodic when the time coordinates of points @xmath23 or @xmath24 are independently increased by @xmath25 @xcite where @xmath26 .",
    "thus the euclidean green function @xmath27 which is obtained from @xmath28 with the help of a wick rotation , is defined on a 4-sphere @xmath12 with the line element @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "note that because of the periodicity property in imaginary time the function @xmath22 can be interpreted as a green function for a canonical ensemble at temperature @xmath31 .",
    "the physical meaning behind this interpretation is that any freely moving observer experiences the dsi state as a thermal bath at temperature @xmath31 , see ref.@xcite",
    ".    a natural generalization of @xmath22 is a green function @xmath32 in the de sitter space which is periodic in imaginary time with an arbitrary period @xmath10 .",
    "functions of this kind can be constructed from @xmath22 with the help of a _ reperiodization _ formula suggested by dowker @xcite .",
    "one can interpret @xmath32 as a green function of a canonical ensemble of particles in the static part ( [ ii.1 ] ) of de sitter space at temperature @xmath7 .",
    "it is also possible to introduce the euclidean function @xmath33 by using a definition analogous to eq.([ii.4 ] ) .",
    "the space where @xmath33 is set on is a spherical domain @xmath34 , which is described by the metric ( [ ii.5 ] ) of the 4-sphere , but now with period @xmath10 along @xmath35 .",
    "the main property of @xmath34 is that it has conical singularities at the points @xmath36 , near which the space looks as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a cone with deficit angle @xmath39 .",
    "their relation was investigated in the case of black hole geometries with the aim to establish the statistical explanation of the black hole entropy , see for instance ref.s@xcite@xcite .",
    "we will not dwell on this issue further since it is not relevant for our purposes .",
    "it has to be also mentioned that in the presence of the killing horizon the function @xmath49 does not have the hadamard form @xcite when @xmath50 . in this case",
    "the stress energy tensor of a quantum field has a non - integrable divergence on the horizon of the chosen static coordinate system @xcite .",
    "as was discussed in ref.@xcite , this property alone may be not sufficient to exclude ft states as unphysical , since the computation of the stress tensor neglects the backreaction effects .",
    "such effects are very strong near the horizon and a reliable computation requires a nonperturbative approach which is not still developed . however , a non - hadamard form of @xmath49 is not an obstacle for the definition of the partition function ( [ ii.6 ] ) .",
    "the conical singularities of @xmath11 result only to a number of additional ultraviolet divergent terms in the effective action @xmath51 and one can use the _ standard _ renormalization procedure to give a meaning to the integral ( [ ii.6 ] ) .",
    "we will discuss this later .",
    "0      we focus now on the definition and computation of the ft effective potential for the scalar electrodynamics in the de sitter space .",
    "a similar computation has been done before by shore @xcite and allen @xcite for the dsi state .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the abelian theories because the generalization to non - abelian case , as was shown in ref.@xcite , is almost straightforward .        as was shown in ref.@xcite , a point @xmath76 where @xmath69 has a minimum , coincides with the one - loop value of the average @xmath67 .",
    "the real part of @xmath69 is a sum of the classical potential energy @xmath77 and a quantum correction .",
    "if the field configuration @xmath76 is unstable , then @xmath78 has a nonvanishing imaginary part which determines the decay probability of this configuration .",
    "hereafter , we will be interested in the situation where the one - loop quantum effects can change significantly the form of the classical potential . as was pointed out by coleman and weinberg @xcite , who investigated the model ( [ iii.1 ] ) in the flat space",
    ", one has to assume to this aim that the gauge coupling @xmath89 is of the order of @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the quantum corrections due to the gauge fields will be comparable with the classical potential . on the other hand , to provide the convergence of the perturbation expansions one has to assume that @xmath90 . in this case",
    "one can safely neglect the contributions to the effective potential of the scalar loops which will be proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "let us note that the @xmath0function method automatically gives a finite expression for the quantum determinants .",
    "the last term in the right hand side of eq.([iii.13 ] ) corresponds to the finite counterterms which are always present after renormalization .",
    "the conical singularities are known to introduce additional ultraviolet divergences , see for instance ref s @xcite .",
    "the renormalization on manifolds with conical singularities has been discussed recently in a number of papers @xcite-@xcite,@xcite .    in the case of the hodge - derham operator",
    "all one - loop divergences which are linear in the conical deficit angle , as shown in ref.@xcite , are removed under standard renormalization of the gravitational couplings @xcite in the bare gravitational action .",
    "the renormalization of the remaining divergences of order @xmath101 in the deficit angle or higher is more involved , and requires additional counterterms in the effective action .",
    "these terms have the form of integral invariants defined on the singular surface @xcite .",
    "the values of the additional couplings can not be predicted in the theory , and so to simplify the analysis we will assume that these couplings in @xmath79 are absent .",
    "what is interesting is that @xmath120 can be found in an analytical form in the two most interesting limits : in the dsi state and in the zt state .",
    "we make use of this fact to consider the phase transitions in the gauge model at different values of the de sitter radius and compare the phase structures of the theory in these two cases .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the form of potentials ( [ iii.17 ] ) and ( [ iii.19 ] ) in the opposite limit , when the curvature of the space - time is very large , namely @xmath150 . since we are interested in the phase transitions , terms in the potential which do not depend on @xmath70 are irrelevant .",
    "hence , from now on it is more convenient to deal with the difference @xmath151 which vanishes for @xmath152 .",
    "0 in order to compare phase transitions in the scalar electrodynamics ( [ iii.1 ] ) in dsi and zt states we rewrite expressions ( [ iii.17 ] ) and ( [ iii.19 ] ) in the following dimensionless form ) was suggested in @xcite . ]",

    "interestingly , all the information about the constants @xmath166 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the considered model is contained in the parameters @xmath167 and @xmath168 defined in eqs.([iii.26 ] ) and ( [ iii.29 ] ) , respectively .    for arbitrary values of constants @xmath166 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 the parameters @xmath167 and @xmath168 are independent .",
    "they can be related to each other only in the case of the minimal coupling @xmath169 .",
    "we consider now the phase structure of the theory in the limit of large and small curvatures of the de sitter space , where it can be investigated analytically .      in this limit @xmath170 and one",
    "has @xmath171 @xmath172 eq.([iv.4 ] ) coincides with the result of ref.@xcite .",
    "as was shown in ref.@xcite the symmetry breaking in this limit in dsi state is characterized by first order phase transitions . under such transitions ,",
    "when the curvature radius @xmath1 reduces to a critical value @xmath173 , the mass of the vector boson changes discontinuously from a value @xmath174 to zero . by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ iv.4 ] ) and ( [ iv.5 ] ) one can see that the effective potential at zero temperature has a similar structure , so in this case one may expect an analogous behavior",
    ".        we can use in this regime asymptotics ( [ iii.25 ] ) and ( [ iii.28 ] ) . as one can see from these equations , the terms proportional to @xmath195 change the sign from positive to negative when @xmath1 becomes larger than a critical value @xmath196 . in this case to have the symmetry breaking in the theory at @xmath197 the terms @xmath198 in ( [ iii.25 ] ) and ( [ iii.28 ] ) have to be positive .",
    "when @xmath1 becomes smaller than @xmath196 the mass of the vector boson gradually vanishes .",
    "this situation corresponds to second order phase transitions .",
    "the critical radius @xmath173 in dsi state is @xcite @xmath199 in order to have a second order phase transition one must ensure that the coefficient of the @xmath198 term in ( [ iii.25 ] ) is positive . by substituting ( [ iii.27 ] ) in eq.([iii.25 ] ) we find that the above condition is satisfied @xcite for @xmath200 the value @xmath201 represents in fact a critical boundary which separates the models of the scalar electrodynamics with different kinds of phase transition . for models with @xmath167 above @xmath202 the system undergoes first order phase transitions , whereas for models with @xmath167 below @xmath202 one has second order phase transitions .",
    "the value of @xmath202 is also confirmed by the numerical analysis .",
    "a similar expression for the critical radius @xmath186 at zero temperature can be found from eq.([iii.28 ] ) @xmath203 the difference between the values of the critical radii can be estimated by their ratio @xmath204 it depends only on @xmath57 and @xmath205 , and for @xmath206 one can conclude that @xmath207 . for the minimal coupling ( @xmath169 ) @xmath208 .",
    "in the case of zt state the critical value @xmath209 can be determined as well . by substituting eq.([iii.31 ] ) in the coefficient of the quartic term of eq.([iii.28 ] ) one gets @xmath210 thus @xmath211 and it is confirmed by the numerical computations .",
    "the typical behavior of the effective potentials in case of second order phase transitions is illustrated by figures 3 and 4 , which are obtained by using formulas ( [ iv.1 ] ) and ( [ iv.2 ] ) .",
    "figure 3 depicts the function @xmath191 for @xmath212 and figure 4 gives @xmath192 for @xmath213 . in both cases",
    "the critical radii @xmath173 and @xmath214 are in agreement with eqs.([iii.27 ] ) and ( [ iii.31 ] ) .",
    "as we have shown , the first order phase transitions always take place in the models of scalar electrodynamics ( [ iii.1 ] ) when constants @xmath167 and @xmath168 are large and positive . on the other hand ,",
    "if these constants are negative with large absolute values , the symmetry breaking corresponds to second order phase transitions .",
    "an analytical study of the region of parameters @xmath57 , @xmath56 and @xmath166 ( or @xmath202 and @xmath209 ) , where the kind of the phase transition changes from the first to the second order is difficult because the effective potentials have quite involved forms ( [ iv.1 ] ) , ( [ iv.2 ] ) .",
    "thus , in principle , one should use here numerical methods .",
    "it is interesting , however , that the analytical estimates @xmath215 and @xmath216 of section 4.2 are in very good agreement with the numerical results . for dsi state",
    "this was first pointed out by allen @xcite .",
    "as we already mentioned , the symmetry breaking mechanism in the considered models is completely determined by the parameters @xmath167 and @xmath168 . by using their definitions ( [ iii.26 ] ) , ( [ iii.29 ] ) one finds that @xmath217 note that the parameter @xmath56 must be chosen positive in order to have a scalar potential bounded from below .",
    "we also assumed that @xmath218 in order to have a considerable quantum correction to the classical potential coming from the gauge fields .",
    "for values @xmath219 our perturbative approach is not reliable , so we have to restrict ourselves to the interval of parameters @xmath220 .",
    "thus , by taking into account that @xmath221 , we find with the help of eq.([iii.ab ] ) the allowed region in the @xmath167@xmath168 plane @xmath222 .",
    "there we can make definite predictions about the properties of the considered models .",
    "this region is shown on figure 5 .",
    "it consists of three subregions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) , bounded by dashed lines .",
    "each subregion indicates a class of models with the same properties .",
    "+ region ( i ) is determined by inequalities @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "if the coupling constants @xmath225 satisfy these restrictions , the corresponding models undergo second order phase transitions in both dsi and zt states .",
    "+ in region ( ii ) one has @xmath226 and @xmath227 and first order phase transitions in both dsi and zt vacua . + region ( iii ) is the most interesting , since in this case @xmath228 but @xmath227 , thus the system undergoes a first order phase transition in zt case , whereas it has a second order phase transition in dsi case .    in case of minimal coupling ( @xmath169 ) , according to eqs.([iii.26 ] ) and ( [ iii.29 ] ) , @xmath229 and @xmath230 , and so only second order phase transitions are possible in both states .",
    "we investigated the effective potential for the gauge models on the singular spherical domains @xmath11 .",
    "the spectrum of the corresponding wave operators on these backgrounds can be found exactly and it enables one to calculate the potential with the help of the @xmath0function .",
    "we have shown that for arbitrary values of @xmath10 there is a simple relation ( [ iii.c ] ) between the one - loop corrections to the potential from gauge and scalar fields .",
    "thus in studying the gauge models in the de sitter space one can make use of the computations of the scalar potential of ref.@xcite .",
    "the effective action on @xmath11 can be interpreted as the free energy of fields in static de sitter space , where the parameter @xmath10 is the inverse temperature of the system .",
    "thus , by changing @xmath10 one can learn how the presence of temperature affects the properties of such a quantum theory .",
    "the aim of the paper was to compare the phase structures of the gauge models in the de sitter invariant vacuum , which is usually used in the quantum cosmology , with the structure of the normal vacuum which is the state at zero temperature .",
    "according to our analysis both vacua have very similar properties in the extreme regimes of very small and very large curvatures .",
    "if the restoration of the gauge symmetry happens at large radius @xmath1 ( small curvature ) of the de sitter space , then the corresponding phase transition is of first order regardless what vacuum is considered .",
    "analogously , if the symmetry is restored at small values of @xmath1 ( large curvature ) , one has second order phase transitions .",
    "the critical masses and radii are completely determined by the constants @xmath167 and @xmath168 , which are the functions of the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath166 and @xmath56 .",
    "expressions ( [ iv.11 ] ) , ( [ iv.12 ] ) and ( [ iii.31 ] ) for the critical parameters in zt state represent the new result .",
    "we have also found the critical value @xmath211 for the parameter @xmath168 , which separates models with second ( @xmath231 ) and first ( @xmath232 ) order phase transitions in zt state .",
    "finally we proved the existence of a class of the models ( @xmath228 and @xmath227 ) where the kinds of phase transition in the two vacua are different .",
    "the detailed analysis of the effective potential for all @xmath10 s is not given here , but it can be carried out in principle by making use of the properties of the @xmath0function . in the most interesting cases , however , it is sufficient to restrict the study to the expansions near the zero and hawking temperatures , as it was done in ref.@xcite .",

    "0 here we consider @xmath0function @xmath233 for the transverse operator in eq.([iii.12 ] ) which is defined for convenience in the dimensionless form as @xmath234 .    according to @xcite the degeneracies in four dimensions read @xmath235 while the eigen ",
