    "the magnetic state of la@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( lsco ) changes tremendously with sr doping .",

    "the nel and the spin - glass phase , the system essentially behaves as an anderson insulator and exhibits only hopping conductivity  @xcite .",
    "superconductivity then sets in for doping @xmath11 , see ref .  .",
    "one of the most intriguing properties of lsco is the static incommensurate magnetic order observed at low temperature in elastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "this order manifests itself as a scattering peak shifted with respect to the antiferromagnetic position .",
    "very importantly , the incommensurate order is a generic feature of lsco . according to experiments in the nel phase",
    ", the incommensurability is almost doping independent and directed along the orthorhombic @xmath1 axis  matsuda02 . in the spin - glass phase , the shift is also directed along the @xmath12 axis , but scales linearly with doping  @xcite .",
    "finally , in the underdoped superconducting region ( @xmath13 ) , the shift still scales linearly with doping , but it is directed along the crystal axes of the tetragonal lattice  @xcite . in the present work we discuss only the insulating phase , @xmath14 .",
    "it is clear that pinning of the diagonal spin structure is due to the orthorhombic distortion of the crystal .",
    "a mechanism for pinning of the diagonal spin structure to the orthorhombic @xmath1 axis was suggested in refs .",
    "the mechanism has four components:1 ) due to strong antiferromagnetic correlations , the minima of dispersion of a mobile hole are at points @xmath15 of the brillouin zone , so the system can , to some extent , be considered as a two valley semiconductor .",
    "2 ) at low temperature , each hole is trapped in a hydrogen - like bound state near the corresponding sr ion , the binding energy is about @xmath16 and the radius of the bound state is about 10 .3 ) due to the orthorhombic distortion , the diagonal hopping matrix elements @xmath17 and @xmath18 are slightly different , and this makes the @xmath1 valley , @xmath19 , deeper than the @xmath0 valley , @xmath20 .",
    "so all the hydrogen - like bound states are built with holes from the @xmath1-valley.4 ) each hydrogen like bound state creates a spiral distortion of the spin background and the distortion is observed in neutron scattering .",
    "so the state at @xmath21 is not a spin glass , it is a disordered spin spiral .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate accurately the diagonal hopping matrix elements and show that the difference is @xmath22mev .",
    "we also discuss the implications of the described physics for the @xmath23 optical absorption and for angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) .",
    "the optical absorption probes the charge distribution , and we predict that the absorption vanishes for polarization along the orthorhombic @xmath0-direction .",
    "arpes probes the spin spiral , and we predict very different spectra in @xmath0 and @xmath1 nodal points .",
    "the 2d @xmath25 model was suggested two decades ago to describe the essential low - energy physics of high-@xmath26 cuprates  @xcite . in",
    "its extended version , this model includes additional hopping matrix elements @xmath24 and @xmath27 to respectively 2nd and 3rd - nearest cu neighbors . the hamiltonian of the @xmath28 model on the square cu lattice has the form:@xmath29here , @xmath30 is the creation operator for an electron with spin @xmath31 @xmath32 at site @xmath33 of the square lattice , @xmath34 indicates 1st- , @xmath35 2nd- , and @xmath36 3rd - nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the spin operator is @xmath37 , and @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the number density operator .",
    "in addition to the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) there is the constraint of no double occupancy , which accounts for strong electron correlations .",
    "the values of the parameters of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) for lsco are known from neutron scattering  @xcite , raman spectroscopy   @xcite , and ab - initio calculations  @xcite to be:@xmath40note that the signs of the hopping terms in the electron hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) have been chosen in such a way that , for a @xmath41 orbital , the hopping matrix elements are positive .",
    "the dispersion of the hole dressed by magnetic quantum fluctuations has minima at the nodal points @xmath42 and is practically isotropic in the vicinity of each  @xcite : @xmath43we set the lattice spacing to unity , 3.81@xmath441 .",
    "the effective mass corresponding to the quadratic dispersion ( [ eq ] ) is approximately twice the electron mass .        in the low - temperature orthorhombic ( lto )",
    "phase , the square cu lattice is slightly deformed as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : the angles , @xmath45 between the edges are obtuse or acute , such that the @xmath46 and @xmath47 diagonals , the orthorhombic translations , have slightly different lengths@xmath48 respectively @xmath49 and @xmath50 on top of this comes an alternating tilt of the oxygen octahedra around the @xmath0 axis by an angle @xmath51 whereby the oxygens in the layer buckle out of the cu plane forming a @xmath52 $ ] -wave in the @xmath1-direction  @xcite .",
    "the values of the orthorhombic and tilting deformations,@xmath53are so tiny that they hardly influence @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 but they do make the diagonal hopping significantly different in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions , as we show below . including @xmath57 in the first , one - electron part of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) yields the following 2d bandstructure:@xmath58note that @xmath59 denotes electron energies and @xmath60 hole energies .",
    "the splitting of the bare valleys is:@xmath61    for comparison , we show in the left - hand side of fig.[bands ] the bandstructure calculated from density - functional theory ( lda ) along the lines connecting the high - symmetry points @xmath62 @xmath63 r @xmath64 s @xmath65 y @xmath66 and b @xmath67 of the 3d _ orthorhombic _",
    "( @xmath68 ) brillouin zone ( bz ) . for simplicity",
    ", we have given the coordinates in terms of the nearly _ tetragonal _ reciprocal cu - lattice translations .",
    "@xmath69 is halfway to the brillouin - zone boundary where the influence of inter - layer hopping is minimal .",
    "we see that no gapping is caused by the @xmath52 $ ] tilting wave . as a consequence",
    ", the lda bandstructure may be folded out to the nearly tetragonal bz where expression ( [ h1 ] ) adequately represents the dispersion of the lda conduction band , indicated by heavy lining , near half - filling . on the righ - hand side of fig.[bands ]",
    "we show a blow - up of the orthorhombic lda bands near the nodal points , s @xmath70 and b @xmath71 along the respective nodal direction , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "finally we see that two different computational techniques , lmto and lapw , give essentially the same result , namely@xmath72this number is surprisingly large : had the cu @xmath41 conduction - band wannier - like orbital been a simple , canonical orbital  canonical78 , the hopping between two such orbitals would have decreased as their distance to the power @xmath73 , which for two @xmath74 orbitals is @xmath75 , and , hence , @xmath76 this , however , neglects that the hopping is almost exclusively via the o@xmath4 @xmath77 and o@xmath78 orbitals , as is amply demonstrated by an lda calculation in which we took the tilting wave to run along @xmath0 instead of along @xmath79 the result was a four times reduction of @xmath80 compared to ( [ lda ] ) !",
    "we therefore conclude that tilting is almost as important as orthorhombicity for the hopping anisotropy .     - like conduction bands shown in thick lines  @xcite .",
    "( b ) blow - up of conduction bands near the nodal points s and b , and along the respective nodal lines , @xmath0 and @xmath79 ( c ) same as ( b ) , but calculated with the full - potential linear augmented plane wave method ( lapw )  @xcite instead of the linear muffin tin orbital method ( lmto )  @xcite ]    to understand why , we turn to the simplest model showing an effect of tilting : emery s 3-band model  @xcite which keeps merely the @xmath81 hopping between cu @xmath41 and its nearest o@xmath4 @xmath77 and o@xmath78 orbitals , as well as the @xmath82 hopping between the nearest o@xmath4 @xmath77 and o@xmath78 neighbors .",
    "it is easy to see that in this model,@xmath83because @xmath81 and the distance of the o @xmath84 level , @xmath85 below the half - filling level , @xmath86 are not influenced by the deformations . in the deformed structure ,",
    "each plane oxygen remains midway between its two nearest cu neighbors , but is slightly above or below the cu plane .",
    "moreover , the o@xmath87 orbital is parallel to the cu - cu line , so that the two o@xmath87 orbitals via which the @xmath88 hopping takes place are at the acute / obtuse angle @xmath89 the main effect of the deformation is , however , not this misalignment , but simply that the distance between the oxygens at the acute angle is @xmath90 and that between the oxygens at the oblate angle is @xmath91 with @xmath92 this gives : @xmath93 which , due to the slower decay of canonical @xmath84 orbitals , is even smaller than the previous @xmath94 estimate . also the tilting contribution is too small .",
    "inclusion of the orbital misalignments in the canonical approximation  @xcite merely changes the result to : @xmath95    another simple model is the axial - orbital model  @xcite which adds to the three orbitals of the emery model a cu - centered , axial orbital , but keeps only hops between nearest neighbors : from o@xmath84 to cu @xmath41 @xmath96 and to the axial orbital @xmath97 the axial orbital is a hybrid between cu@xmath98 cu @xmath99 apical o@xmath100 and axial cation orbitals , and its energy , @xmath101 @xmath102 is _ the _ material dependent electronic parameter in the lda .",
    "since @xmath82 proceeds via the axial orbital in this model , and therefore equals @xmath103 it can not depend on @xmath104 for the same reason , the hopping from o@xmath105 to o@xmath105 over the distance 1 has the same value , @xmath106 and this is what leads to @xmath107 when downfolding to the 1-band model  @xcite .",
    "however , recent first - principles 3-band hamiltonians formed by numerical downfolding of the lda hilbert space  @xcite do not support this ; they yield a @xmath77-@xmath77 hop , which can only be understood by the presence of a large material - independent contribution , @xmath108 from hopping via cu 4@xmath77 @xcite . to the @xmath77-@xmath109 hop",
    ", there can be no such contribution , @xmath110 _ unless _ there is orthorhombic distortion .",
    "also buckling - induced anisotropy may be caused by hopping via cu @xmath111 .",
    "to see whether coupling via excited cu @xmath112 degrees of freedom can be the reason for the surprisingly large anisotropy ( [ lda ] ) found by the lda calculations , we now add these degrees of freedom to the axial model and , as usual , include hops only between nearest neighbors .",
    "for the directional dependences we use the canonical approximation and find:@xmath113the superb agreement with the lda result ( [ lda ] ) may be fortuitous , but also the relative contribution from orthorhombicity and tilt agrees .",
    "so we believe that the surprisingly large hopping anisotropy to be explained by this simple expression . it may be noted that going to materials with higher @xmath114 @xmath101 decreases and with it the hopping anisotropy .",
    "finally it should be noted that for simplicity we have taken @xmath115 although @xmath116 is an axial orbital and , hence , material dependent .",
    "the @xmath24 describes hopping within the same magnetic sublattice .",
    "therefore , to account for many electron correlations in the anisotropy of the single hole dispersion one only needs to know the quasiparticle residue @xmath117 .",
    "this leads to anisotropic correction to the hole dispersion  @xcite@xmath118 the correction to the dispersion vanishes at antinodal points @xmath119 , @xmath120 and it is maximum at nodal points , @xmath15 , where @xmath121 .",
    "the energy difference between the nodal points is    @xmath122    thus , at low temperature all hydrogen - like bound states are formed from the @xmath1-valley holes , the @xmath0-valley is empty .",
    "we would like to stress that this is true only in the insulating phase . in the superconducting phase which arises after percolation of the bound states , @xmath123 ,",
    "both valleys are populated .    the energy difference ( [ deab ] )",
    "is the single hole effect .",
    "it accounts for spin quantum fluctuations , but it assumes usual neel order . there is another collective contribution to the energy difference @xmath124 .",
    "the collective contribution is due to the spiral spin ordering established at @xmath125 .",
    "the collective contribution is considered below in the arpes section .",
    "certainly , in the end the collective contribution is also driven by the asymmetry ( [ deab ] ) because the asymmetry s causes depopulation of the @xmath0-valley .",
    "we consider the optical transitions involving removing a @xmath74 electron from a central placket of fig .",
    "[ figa ] resulting in a @xmath127-state and transferring it to a linear combination of zhang rice ( zr ) singlet states on neighboring plackets .",
    "note that the transition staying within the same plaque is not allowed optically .",
    "this particular transition is of course only allowed if there is a hole in the zr state on neighboring plackets and therefore is only present in a hole doped material . in the undoped material",
    "the corresponding transition would have to be to neighboring d states resulting in a linear combination of @xmath128 configurations there .",
    "this transition would be at an energy of about the charge transfer gap higher than the transitions to zr singlet states and is easily distinguishable from those to the zr states .",
    "these transitions involve the full @xmath127 multiplet structure and their energies can be obtained from the calculations described in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as from early resonant photoemission experiments which locate the @xmath127 multiplets in these materials .",
    "@xcite looking at fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite we see that the @xmath127 states occur in the energy range between 8 and 15 ev below the zr singlet state .",
    "the large energy spread is due to the multiplet structure in the @xmath127 configurations .",
    "we now describe why the polarization dependence of these transitions will be very sensitive to where in momentum space the zr states are situated and therefore the polarization dependence represents a test of the hypothesis described above . for this discussion",
    "the orthorhombic distortion is no longer important except for the proposal that it causes the doped hole states to be concentrated at the b minimum with a wave function given by @xmath129where @xmath130 is a relatively smooth wave function of the bound state , @xmath131 .",
    "the smooth wave function is not important for optical absorption .",
    "only the fast phase factor @xmath132 is important . for a bound state based on a hole from the @xmath0-minimum the function",
    "@xmath133 is the same while the phase factor @xmath134 is different .    to describe the above transition we clearly need to go beyond a @xmath25 or hubbard model taking into account explicitly the charge transfer nature of the gap as in the zaanen - sawatzky - allen classification scheme  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figa ] we display the cuo@xmath135 plane structure and the orbitals considered .",
    "the hole phase factor @xmath136 is shown in red near the corresponding cu ion .",
    "the transition to a zero momentum zr state is parity forbidden .",
    "however the hole resides in a zr state with nonzero momentum where transition is optically allowed due to interference of zr states centered on different cu sites .     plane .",
    "open circles denote cu ions and blue circles denote oxygen ions .",
    "cu ions in the cluster are enumerated by magenta numbers 1 - 9 and oxygen ions are enumerated by four magenta letters a , b , c , d .",
    "the phase factor , @xmath137 , is shown in red near the corresponding cu ion.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    let us consider the case when the final hole resides at the first cu site , @xmath138 . here for short notations",
    "we denote @xmath127 state as @xmath139 .",
    "the transition @xmath140 can occur when the initial p - hole resides on oxygens a , b , c , d and comes from the zr states centered at cu sites 2,4,6,8 .",
    "therefore the transition amplitude is @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the electric field of the photon .",
    "let us denote by d the dipole matrix element @xmath143the symmetry relations between nonzero matrix elements follow from fig .",
    "figa @xmath144hence , we find from ( [",
    "a])@xmath145thus we conclude that there is an absorption if the wave is polarized along the orthorhombic @xmath1-axis , @xmath146 and there is no absorption if the wave is polarized along the orthorhombic @xmath0-axis , @xmath147 .",
    "basically this is the only possible correlation one can write kinematically , @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is momentum of the hole .",
    "so , the answer is obvious even without a calculation .",
    "the optical absorption we have discussed is proportional to doping @xmath150 .",
    "we stress that the prediction for the low temperature absorption asymmetry is @xmath151 and this is equally applicable to the neel and spin - glass  phases of lsco .",
    "the optical asymmetry is different from that in the dc conductivity where both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite the asymmetry at low temperature is not that large , @xmath15250% , and of the opposite sign , @xmath153 .",
    "we consider photoemission from @xmath0 and @xmath1 nodal points .",
    "there is a difference in energy that is given by eq .",
    "( [ deab ] ) .",
    "this is already an interesting effect .",
    "however , there is a much bigger effect that is due to the spin spiral in the spin - glassphase .",
    "the pitch of the spiral directed along the @xmath1-axis is  sushkov05,luscher07 @xmath154where @xmath155 is spin stiffness , @xmath156 is the hole - spin - wave coupling constant , and @xmath150 is doping .",
    "( [ p ] ) agrees very well with neutron scattering data . a hole with momentum @xmath157 interacts with the spiral .",
    "the interaction splits the hole dispersion in two branches with the following energy shift  @xcite @xmath158thus the hole dispersion near the @xmath0  nodal point , @xmath159 , is practically not influenced by the spiral , @xmath160 . on the other hand the hole dispersion near the @xmath1  nodal point , @xmath161 ,",
    "is changed as @xmath162accounting this correction together with ( [ deab ] ) we find@xmath163note that the second ( collective ) contribution of this difference scales linearly with doping and it is pretty large , it is @xmath15230mev at @xmath164 .",
    "thus the present picture predicts that the lowest branch of the dispersion with energy approximately equal to chemical potential is at the nodal @xmath1-point .",
    "the dispersion at the nodal @xmath0-point is by @xmath15240mev higher ( we present the estimate for @xmath164 ) .",
    "finally , there is another branch of the dispersion at the nodal @xmath1-point that is by @xmath15260mev above the chemical potential , this branch can be pretty broad .",
    "the present consideration is applicable to the doping interval @xmath125 where the disordered spiral is established . in the neel phase , @xmath165 , the collective contribution in ( [ deab1 ] )",
    "is suppressed .",
    "we have demonstrated that the 0.9% orthorhombic distortion of the cu lattice causes 7% difference in diagonal hopping matrix elements , and that the 3@xmath166 tilting of the oxygen octahedra causes an additional 4% difference .",
    "this 11% difference together with the effect of strong magnetic fluctuations ( small hole pockets ) and together with localization of holes due to coulomb trapping by sr ions leads to depopulation of the @xmath20 pocket in the insulating phase , @xmath14 . as a result",
    "the optical transition @xmath23 is allowed only if the electric field is polarized along the orthorhombic @xmath1-axis .",
    "another prediction that is related to the spin spiral structure is the asymmetry of arpes spectra : the hole dispersion at the @xmath1-nodal point is close to the chemical potential , while at the @xmath0-nodal point it is by 25 - 50 mev higher depending on doping .",
