    "carbon nanotubes exhibit remarkable flexibility when subjected to cross - sectional deformation .",
    "@xcite such flexibility has been evidenced by spectroscopy and diffraction measurements in which hydrostatic pressure on the order of a few gpa caused flattening and polygonization in the cross section .",
    "@xcite molecular - dynamics ( md ) @xcite and density - functional - theory - based simulations@xcite revealed more details about the mechanism of radial deformation under pressure .",
    "radial deformation can also be caused by a nanoindentation @xcite under which the elastic response of single - walled nanotubes ( swnts ) is determined by a universal law that depends on the tube radius @xmath1 and applied load.@xcite as the radial deformation of nanotubes is strongly correlated with their electronic @xcite and optical @xcite properties , its clarification should be important from the viewpoint of the use of nanotubes as components of nanoscale devices .",
    "the cross section of an isolated swnt exhibits a circular - to - elliptic transition at a critical hydrostatic pressure @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 decreases with @xmath1 as @xcite @xmath4 , which agrees with the conclusion of the classical continuum theory .",
    "@xcite this scenario , however , fails in the case of multi - walled nanotubes ( mwnts ) .",
    "it has been shown that mwnts consisting of several tens of concentric walls undergo a novel cross - sectional deformation , called radial corrugation , @xcite in which the outer walls exhibit wavy structures along the circumferential direction .",
    "the radial corrugation originates from the multilayered nature , _",
    "i.e. , _ the competing effects between the mechanical instability of outer walls with large radii and the radial rigidity of inner walls with small radii",
    ".    the corrugation behavior of a mwnt is believed to change if it occurs in an embedding elastic medium .",
    "suppose that a mwnt is embedded in a large elastic medium that is in complete contact with its outermost wall .",
    "a uniform shrinkage of the medium exerts an external force on the outermost wall , as similar to the case of hydrostatic pressure .",
    "but a difference arises when the medium possesses moderate stiffness , since the energy required to deform the medium should be responsible for determining the stable corrugation pattern .",
    "in fact , when a thin _",
    "plate is embedded in an elastic medium and comressed , it shows a uni - directional corrugation whose profile is strongly dependent on the medium s stiffness.@xcite this fact implies an uncovered corrugation mechanism peculiar to embedded mwnts , it i.e. , dinstinct from the hydrostatic pressure cases , which imposes new challenges .    in this article",
    ", we demonstrate that the presence of a surrounding elastic medium triggers diverse variations of corrugation modes that can not be observed in mwnts under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "these diverse modes are found to be grouped into two corrugation phases that exhibit a significant difference in the corrugation amplitude of the innermost wall of the mwnt .",
    "these findings will help to tune the core - tube geometry of mwnts , thus providing useful information for developing nanofluidic @xcite or nanoelectrochemical @xcite devices whose performance depends on the geometry of the inner hollow cavity of nanotubes .",
    "the current work has been inspired by the discovery of the self - healing properties of carbon nanostructures under electron - beam irradiation.@xcite banhart _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found that carbon onions , assemblies of concentric spherical carbon shells , shrink toward smaller onion structures when irradiated .",
    "this shrinkage is attributed to the knock - on collision of carbon atoms from constituent shells ; the resulting vacancies are healed by annealing reconstruction @xcite that shrinks the system with reduced intershell spacings . as a result ,",
    "extreme pressure arises in the core of spherical carbon shells . using a similar irradiation technique , sun _",
    "@xcite synthesized mwnts with reduced interwall spacing and revealed high pressures of several tens gpa within the hollow cavity .",
    "it is thus expected that self - contraction of _ only _ outermost walls of a mwnt ( possibly realized by finely - focused beam ) will provide the setting for radial corrugation of the interior part of the mwnt .",
    "it should be borne in mind that in the carbon onion experiments , diamond nucleation occurs at the center of the onion as the induced pressure is too high for the original sp@xmath0 bonds to persist.@xcite to make the current work convincing , therefore , it is important to examine whether the critical pressure @xmath3 for the corrugation is low enough to prevent the breaking of sp@xmath0 bonds within the inner walls .",
    "we will revisit this issue in section iii b.    -walled nanotube is subjected to electron - beam irradiation .",
    "( b ) irradiation with fine resolution kicks off a portion of carbon atoms located within @xmath5 outermost walls .",
    "( c ) the eroded @xmath6 walls are healed and radially contracting , as a result of which extreme pressure is exerted on the @xmath7 innermost walls .",
    "( d ) typical corrugation modes of the pressed @xmath7-walled nanotubes are shown with the mode index @xmath8.,width=332 ]      when treating many - walled nanotubes , atomistic simulations are realistic and accurate but they demand huge computational cost in general .",
    "thus we used a simplified model based on the continuum approximation .",
    "@xcite first , we map an mwnt onto concentric cylindrical shells endowed with @xcite the in - plane stiffness @xmath9 nn / nm , the flexural rigidity @xmath10 nn@xmath11 nm , and poisson s ratio @xmath12 , in which the inter - shell separation is defined by 0.3415 nm . figures [ fig_1](a)-(c ) illustrate the shrinking process considered in this paper .",
    "we assume an @xmath13-walled nanotube under irradiation that kicks off a portion of carbon atoms located within @xmath14 outer walls surrounding @xmath7 inner walls . then , self - contraction of the @xmath6 walls results in high pressure that exerts on the @xmath7 walls that they encapsulate . for the sake of analytical arguments",
    ", we simplify the @xmath6 walls by a continuum elastic medium and assume the outermost boundary of the @xmath7-walled tube to be in contact with the inner surface of the medium throughout the shrinking process ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_1](b ) and ( c ) ) . as a consequence ,",
    "various corrugation patterns arise in the cross section of the @xmath7-walled nanotube . only a few examples of the corrugation patterns are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](d ) together with the associated mode index @xmath8 representing the wave number in the circumferential direction .",
    "it is noteworthy that the mechanical @xcite and structural @xcite consequences of irradiation in few - walled nanotubes have already been explored by atomistic simulations .",
    "xu _ et al . _",
    "numerically reproduced the irradiation - induced high pressure within a double - walled nanotube@xcite ; they artificially removed carbon atoms from the outer wall and observed the subsequent self - healing process that causes an extreme pressure acting on the inner wall .",
    "a similar healing process is assumed to occur when the outer walls of a many - walled nanotube are eroded locally , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](b ) .",
    "it should be noted that in the existing experiment , it is possible to remove carbon atoms from an mwnt with monolayer precision.@xcite this fact supports the validity of our hypothesis that a part of the carbon atoms within only a desired number of outermost walls is removed locally .      the stable cross - sectional shape of the embedded tube is obtained by minimizing its mechanical energy @xmath15 per unit axial length,@xcite @xmath16 the first term @xmath17 with the definition @xmath18 represents the deformation energy ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , in - plane and bending - induced strains of the @xmath21th wall having the radius @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a circumferential coordinate .",

    "the radial and circumferential components of normal stress in the medium are denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , and the shear stress is denoted by @xmath40 ; all the three quantities are functions of @xmath41 . then , @xmath35 is determined by @xmath38 and @xmath40 at @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 describe the corrugation amplitudes of the outermost wall of the embedded mwnt ;",

    "details of the derivation of @xmath35 are presented in appendix a.      our objectives are to determine : ( i ) the optimal displacements @xmath26 and @xmath50 that minimize @xmath15 under a given value of @xmath32 , and ( ii ) the critical pressure @xmath3 above which the circular cross section of an mwnt is elastically deformed into a non - circular one .",

    "conversely , in the outward - deformation mode , the innermost wall maintains its circular shape . which class of modes is observed immediately above @xmath3 depends on the values of the innermost tube radius @xmath72 and @xmath7 under consideration .",
    "as shown below , larger @xmath67 and smaller @xmath7 favor the inward mode with larger @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ fig_2 ] ( a ) shows the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath3 for various conditions of @xmath67 . for all @xmath67s , @xmath3 exhibits two shallow peaks ( one upward and one downward ) whose positions shift to larger @xmath7 with an increase in @xmath67 .",
    "one might expect that a larger @xmath7 leads to a larger @xmath3 , because an increase in the concentric walls would enhance the radial rigidity .",
    "this conjecture holds for mwnts with intermediate values of @xmath7 between the two shallow peaks ; for instance , @xmath3 for @xmath73 nm increases slowly with @xmath7 between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "however , to the right of the upward peak , @xmath3 decreases monotonically with @xmath7 , in contrast to the conjecture above",
    ". such decay of @xmath3 at large @xmath7 arises from the mechanical instability of outside walls whose radii grow with @xmath7 , implying the occurrence of outward - deformation modes at large @xmath7 .",

    "[ fig_2](a ) that a large portion of @xmath3 s data lies on the order of several gpa , though they occasionally exceed ten gpa or more at certain limited conditions . in the latter conditions ,",
    "the continuum shell approximation may break down due to interwall sp@xmath76/sp@xmath0 hybridization bonds generated by pressure .",
    "in fact , earlier md simulations @xcite suggested that radial pressure of approximately 40 gpa ( or 30 gpa ) destroys the tubular structure of an encapsulated swnt having the radius @xmath77 nm ( @xmath78 1.2 nm ) through the formation of hybrid sp@xmath0/sp@xmath76 self linkages inside the tube .",
    "it is thus conjectured that similar hybrid bonds between neighboring walls in mwnts for @xmath79 nm occurs above a threshold pressure comparable to ( or maybe less than ) tens gpa .",
    "precise determination of the threshold requires atomistic calculations ; hence we proceed arguments bearing in mind that the obtained results are physically relevant only when @xmath3 is lower than the threshold ( more or less tens gpa ) that remains to be determined .",
    "figure [ fig_2](b ) shows the three - dimensional plot @xmath3 on the @xmath67-@xmath7 plane .",
    "the plot exhibits a ridge line that extends from the top at @xmath80 to the skirt at @xmath81 of the @xmath3-surface .",
    "the ridge line corresponds to a phase boundary that separates the inward- and outward - deformation phases .",
    "in fact , an inward - deformation mode occurs in the region to the left of the ridge line , as we will find in the phase diagram in fig .",

    "[ fig_3](b ) ) and the phase boundary shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](a ) .",
    "a salient feature of fig .  [ fig_3](a ) is the absence of an elliptic deformation phase ( @xmath82 ) within the ranges of @xmath67 and @xmath7 we have considered .",
    "the absence of the @xmath82 mode is in contrast with the cases of mwnts and swnts under hydrostatic pressure ; in fact , the @xmath82 mode in the latter two cases is the primary mode observed in a large domain of the @xmath67-@xmath7 space .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained a wide variety of corrugation modes for various values of @xmath67 and @xmath7 , where the variation of @xmath8 is systematic with the changes in @xmath67 and @xmath7 . in the inward - deformation phase , for instance , larger @xmath67 and smaller @xmath7 favor corrugation modes with large @xmath8 .",
    "contrariwise , in the outward phase , smaller @xmath67 and larger @xmath7 favor corrugation modes with large @xmath8 .",
    "the contrasting difference in corrugation amplitude distributions between the inward and outward phases is quantified by plotting the deformation amplitudes @xmath83 introduced in eq .",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] the sequential variation of the corrugation amplitude distribution in the cross section near the phase boundary , in the inward mode ( @xmath91 ) , the restoring force exerted by the surrounding medium is relatively strong so that it tends to prevent radial deformation of outer walls ; this is why inner walls exhibit significant corrugation amplitudes to lower the energy @xmath15 of the system . by increasing @xmath7 ,",
    "such restoring force effects become ineffective to support the radial instability of outer walls , as a result of which the system falls into the outward phase for @xmath92 .",
    "a similar scenario applies if we fix @xmath7 and modulate @xmath67 in the vicinity of the phase boundary .",
    "the present results are based on the approximation that the radially shrinking part of an mwnt under electron - beam irradiation is mapped onto a continuum elastic medium with homogeneous and isotropic elasticity of the modulus @xmath93 gpa .",
    "the validity of the homogeneity and isotropy hypothesis depends on the following two effects of irradiation on the mechanical stiffness of mwnts : irradiation reduces the axial stiffness because it creates vacancies,@xcite and simultaneously , it enhances the radial stiffness owing to the production of covalent bonding between adjacent walls.@xcite a quantitative examination of the degree to which this hypothesis holds requires elaborated measurements or large - scale atomistic simulations , and therefore , we have no available data for the proof . instead , it is possible to generalize the theoretical method by considering the possible anisotropic elasticity in the medium .",
    "our preliminary calculations showed that moderate anisotropy causes little modification in the phase diagram .",
    "more detailed results will be shown elsewhere .",
    "we have also performed corrugation analyses by imposing other values of @xmath94 than @xmath95 gpa .",
    "it was found that larger ( smaller ) values of @xmath94 result in more ( less ) number of corrugation modes observed in the phase diagram with fixed ranges of @xmath67 and @xmath7 set in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](a ) . with decreasing @xmath94 , the phase boundary shifts downward until @xmath96 gpa , below which the boundary disappears leaving the outward phase as the only possibility .",
    "therefore , our predictions of diverse corrugation patterns and the two corrugation phases are possible for any choice of @xmath94 as far as @xmath97 gpa .    from an engineering perspective",
    ", the selectivity of the innermost wall geometry by tuning the material parameters @xmath67 , @xmath7 and @xmath32 may be useful in developing nanotube - based nanofluidic @xcite or nanoelectrochemical devices @xcite , because both utilize the hollow cavity within the innermost tube .",
    "a very interesting issue from the academic viewpoint is the effect of the core tube deformation on the physical and chemical properties of intercalated molecules confined in the hollow cavity .",
    "it has thus far been known that various types of intercalated molecules ( diatomic gas , water , organic , and transition metal molecules , _ etc . _ ) can fill the innermost hollow cavities of nanotubes @xcite and exhibit intriguing behaviors that are distinct from those of the corresponding bulk systems.@xcite these distinct behaviors originate from the fact that the intermolecular spacings become comparable to the linear dimension of the nanoscale confining space .",
    "therefore , the core tube deformation that breaks the cylindrical symmetry of the initial nanoscale compartment will engender unique properties of intercalated molecules that are peculiar to the constrained condition in a radially corrugated space .     of each @xmath21-th concentric wall of @xmath7-walled nanotubes with @xmath98 nm .",
