    "the proper evaluation of averages in statistical physics requires the recourse to the gibbs idealization of infinitely many copies of the same system , namely , to the gibbs ensemble that is of fundamental importance for the theoretical predictions . in practice ,",
    "when only the observation of a single system is possible , this ideal ensemble average is assumed to be identical to the more accessible average in time on the same system .",
    "this is the ergodic assumption that the tracking of single molecules proves to be frequently violated @xcite , a phenomenon called _",
    "ergodicity breaking_. establishing a good theoretical command of ergodicity breaking is of fundamental importance when we move from physics to biology , to physiology and to sociology , since ergodicity breaking seems to be a general property of complex systems in the out of equilibrium condition .",
    "it has to be stressed , however , that one of the origins of the ergodicity breaking observed in molecular diffusion in biological cells , is the occurrence of non - poisson renewal ( npr ) events , which produces a form of out of equilibrium condition that is not to be confused with a more conventional form of out of equilibrium evolution such as the slow regression to thermodynamical equilibrium , and with another cause of non - renewal ergodicity breaking that we shall discuss hereby .",
    "in fact , a renewal event is equivalent to a total rejuvenation of the system , with no memory of the earlier events , and , in spite of this total independence of the earlier events , it gives the impression of being characterized by extended memory .",
    "this is especially evident when the time distance between the occurrence of two consecutive renewal events is described by a waiting time distribution with a diverging first moment . in this case",
    "we may find a condition where the random walker has just occupied the same position @xmath2 for a large time in the past , leading us to make the plausible conjecture that it will keep that position in the future , the future inactivity being a sort of memory of the past inactivity .",
    "this former form of ergodicity breaking was very clearly illustrated in @xcite .",
    "the diffusion process of a molecule that as a result of ensemble average would yield @xmath3 with @xmath0 , namely the sub diffusional scaling @xmath4 , was studied by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite making averages in time rather than on infinitely many copies of the same system .",
    "these authors showed that the second moment evaluated in time does not yield the scaling @xmath5 .",
    "they got instead the result    @xmath6 ^ 2 dt \\propto \\frac{\\delta}{l^{1-\\alpha}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the length of the time series analyzed .",
    "this impressive result indicates that the adoption of time average turns a sub - diffusional into a normal diffusion process with the surprising property , however , that the intensity of the second moment becomes weaker and weaker upon increase of the time length of the observed time series .",
    "the same kind of dependence on the length of the time series was found also in the power spectrum @xmath8 of the renewal generators of sub - diffusion @xcite , which turned out to be very well described by @xmath9 notice that we use the condition @xmath0 throughout the whole paper and that we adopt the notation @xmath10 and @xmath11 to denote ensemble and time average , respectively .",

    ", with the values @xmath13 randomly selected from a gaussian distribution . in the literature the psychological time is usually denoted as operational time . the adoption of the term of psychological time is mainly motivated by our wish of explaining the results of this article with intuitive arguments , even if the adoption of the concept of subjective time turned out to be useful to explain the emergence of an inverse power law to connect the psychological time to the clock time @xcite",
    "actually , in the clock time the distance between two consecutive values of @xmath13 , with vanishing values in between , is selected from a distribution density @xmath14 with the time asymptotic property @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "we plan to extend ctrw to the condition where in the psychological time the fluctuation perceived by the runner is not random but correlated , and the correlation function of the fluctuation @xmath13 is extremely slow .",

    "this correlation function is not integrable , thereby making the correlation time infinite .",
    "this is a generalization of the ctrw and the main result of this paper is that the joint action of renewal events with diverging mean waiting time and infinite correlation time of the fluctuation @xmath13 generates localization .    to stress the special nature of non - poisson renewal processes it is convenient to mention another form of ergodicity - breaking process , called scaled brownian motion ( sbm ) @xcite",
    "this form of anomalous diffusion is attracting an increasing interest by the researchers working on anomalous diffusion in biological cells @xcite .",

    "@xcite , where the scaling index @xmath35 corresponds to the infinite memory of fluctuation @xmath13 , with no random events , and this lack of random events has the impressive effect of completely suppressing the manifestation of intermittent randomness .",

    "the first form of joint action of two different sources of anomalous diffusion discussed in this article rests on the extension of ctrw , where the runner sees in her psychological time random events , to the case where the jumps made by the runner in her psychological time are correlated , as a consequence of the infinite memory of the fbm generating fluctuations . in other words",

    "this has the effect of producing the time scale dilatation @xmath73 and a proper graphical representation requires the trajectory @xmath26to be compressed by multiplying time by the squeezing factor @xmath74 where @xmath7 is the total length of the time series under observation .",
    "however , the renewal nature of the events perceived by the runner makes the dilatation - contraction process significantly different from the ordinary mapping procedure and as a result we get for the diffusion process a second moment that is much smaller than that occurring in the runner s mind , and , as we shall see , it may completely vanish .",
    "this is an impressive result because the two sources of anomalous diffusion discussed in this section are responsible for two opposite effects .",
    "the trapping of diffusion at the same position @xmath2 would be responsible for sub - diffusion , in clock time , whereas the infinite memory of the fluctuation @xmath13 produces super diffusion in the psychological time scale .",
