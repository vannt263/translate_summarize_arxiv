    "often , the ads / cft correspondence between string theory or some other theory including quantized gravity on bulk ads and super - symmetric yang - mills theory on its conformal boundary @xcite is formulated in terms of euclidean path integrals . in the absence of mathematically rigorous approaches to path integrals of string type ( see however @xcite ) or even gravity , it seems to be reasonable to use the well - established theory of constructive quantum field theory ( qft ) @xcite as a testing lab for some aspects of the more complex original ads / cft conjecture . that such simplified versions of the ads / cft correspondence are in fact possible",
    "was already noted by witten @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and further elaborated by @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we give a mathematically rigorous version of the latter work ( in @xcite one finds some related ideas ) , leaving however the infra - red ( ir ) problem open . in this note",
    "we come back to the ir problem and we show how the difference between the ir problem in the ads / cft correspondence as compared with the usual ir problem in constructive qft leads to somewhat unexpected results .",
    "the authors would like to underline that , in contrast to @xcite , the present article is rather focused on ideas and thus leaves space for the interpretation of the validity of the results .",
    "we will comment on that in several places .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the following section we introduce the mathematical framework of ads / cft correspondence and define rigorous probabilistic path integrals on ads . in section [ 3sect ]",
    "we recall the main results from @xcite , i.e. that the generating functional that is obtained from imposing certain boundary conditions at the conformal boundary ( which is the way generating functionals are defined in string theory ) can in fact be written as a usual generating functional of some other field theory . from the latter form it is then easy to extract structural properties , e.g. reflection positivity of the functional , in the usual way .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , it is not clear whether a functional integral can be associated to the boundary theories .",
    "these statements hold for all sorts of interactions with a ir - cut - off . in section [ 4sect ] the ir - problem in this version of the ads / cft correspondence is discussed on a heuristic level .",
    "we also sketch the proof of triviality of the generating functional of the conformally invariant theory on the conformal boundary of ads for the case of an uv - regularized @xmath0 interaction .",
    "we briefly survey strategies that might be candidates to overcome the triviality obstacle at a non - rigorous level and we comment on specific problems with such strategies .",
    "the final section gives some preliminary conclusions and an outlook on open research problems in understanding further the mathematical basis of ads / cft .",
    "let us consider the @xmath1 dimensional ambient space @xmath2 with inner product of signature @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "then the submanifold defined by @xmath6 is a @xmath7 dimensional lorentz manifold with metric induced by the ambient metric .",
    "it is called the @xmath7 dimensional anti de sitter ( ads ) space .",
    "formal wick rotation @xmath8 converts the ambient space into the space @xmath9 with signature @xmath10 . under wick rotation",
    ", the ads space is converted to the hyperbolic space @xmath11 , which is a riemannian submanifold of the ambient @xmath1 dimensional minkowski space .",
    "we call @xmath12 the euclidean ads space .",
    "it has been established with full mathematical rigor that euclidean random fields that fulfill the axioms of invariance , ergodicity and reflection positivity give rise , via an osterwalder ",
    "schrader reconstruction theorem , to local quantum field theories on the universal covering of the relativistic ads , cf .",
    "@xcite justifying the above sketched formal wick rotation .",
    "hence a constructive approach with reflection positive euclidean functional integrals is viable .",
    "it is convenient to work in the so called half - space model of euclidean ads ( henceforth the word euclidean will be dropped ) .",
    "this coordinate system is obtained via the change of variables @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 which maps @xmath17 to @xmath12 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the metric on @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 which implies that the canonical volume form is @xmath22 .",
    "the conformal boundary of @xmath12 then is the @xmath23-dimensional euclidean space @xmath24 with metric @xmath25 which is obtained via the limit @xmath26 and a conformal transformation of the ads metric .",
    "of course , the upshot of the ads / cft correspondence is that the action of the lorentz group on the ads space @xmath12 gives rise to an action of the conformal group transformations on the conformal boundary .",
    "one thus expects an ads symmetric qft ( or string / quantum gravity  theory ) on the bulk @xmath12 to give , if properly restricted to the conformal boundary , a conformally invariant theory on @xmath27 .",
    "we will now make this precise . on the hyperbolic space @xmath12 one",
    "has two invariant green s functions (  bulk - to - bulk propagators \" ) for the operator @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the laplacian and @xmath30 a real number suitably bounded from below , that differ by scaling properties towards the conformal boundary @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the hypergeometric function , @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite . taking pointwhise scaling limits for @xmath26 in one or two of the arguments , the bulk - to - boundary and boundary - to - boundary propagators",
    "are obtained @xmath37 and @xmath38 if ( [ 2.2eqa ] ) or ( [ 2.3eqa ] ) do not define locally integrable functions , the expressions on the right hand side are defined via analytic continuation in the weights @xmath39 .",
    "an important relation between @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the covariance splitting formula for @xmath41 given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "we now pass on to the description of mathematically well - defined functional integrals .",
    "let @xmath46 be the infinitely differentiable , compactly supported functions on @xmath12 endowed with the topology of compact convergence .",
    "the propagator @xmath40 is the resolvent function to the laplacian @xmath29 with dirichlet boundary conditions at conformal infinity , from which it follows that @xmath40 is stochastically positive , @xmath47 @xmath48 , and reflection positive as long as @xmath49 .",
    "the latter value is determined by the lower bound of the spectrum of @xmath29 on @xmath12 . in",
    "explicit , if @xmath50 is the reflection in @xmath51-direction , then for any @xmath52 if @xmath53 we have @xmath54 cf .",
    "@xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , via application of minlos theorem , there exists a unique probability measure @xmath57 on the measurable space @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the topological dual space of @xmath60 and @xmath61 the associated borel sigma algebra , such that @xmath62 . by setting @xmath63",
    "we define the canonical random field associated with @xmath57 , i.e. a random variable valued distribution . in the following we omit the distinction between @xmath64 and @xmath65 and write @xmath65 for both .",
    "let @xmath66 , @xmath67 be the smallest sigma algebra generated by the functions @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 be the functions that are @xmath71-measurable .",
    "we use the special abbreviations @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "then @xmath57 is reflection positive , i.e. @xmath74 the reflection @xmath75 is defined as @xmath76 with @xmath77 @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 is the duality between @xmath59 and @xmath60 induced by the @xmath82 inner product .",
    "let @xmath83 be a set of interaction potentials indexed by the net of bounded , measurable subsets @xmath84 in @xmath12 .",
    "in particular these sets have finite volume @xmath85 .",
    "we require that the following conditions hold :    * integrability : @xmath86 @xmath87 ; * locality : @xmath88 ; * invariance : @xmath89 @xmath57a.s .. * additivity : @xmath90 for @xmath91 . * non - degeneracy : @xmath92 @xmath57a.s .",
    "if @xmath93 .    then , using ( i ) , we obtain a family of interacting measures on @xmath58 , indexed by the net @xmath94 , by setting @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "using ( ii)(v ) we get whenever @xmath97 @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "hence reflection positivity is preserved under the perturbation .",
    "furthermore , from the invariance of @xmath57 under @xmath100 we get that @xmath101 . here",
    "@xmath102 induces an action on @xmath59 via @xmath103 and @xmath104 is the pushforward under this action .",
    "consequently , if the limit ( in distribution ) @xmath105 exists and is unique , the limiting measure is invariant under @xmath100 and reflection positive .",
    "invariance follows from the equivalence of the nets @xmath94 and @xmath106 and the postulated uniqueness of the limit over the net @xmath94 .",
    "let us next consider functional integrals associated with the green s function @xmath41 . in the case when @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) we get that @xmath43 is stochastically positive since @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath111 wrt @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath43 is reflection positive in @xmath51-direction ( in the usual sense , cf .",
    "@xcite ) if and only if @xmath114 , which is also known as the unitarity bound .",
    "it is clear from the decomposition ( [ 2.4eqa ] ) that @xmath41 is stochastically positive if @xmath40 and @xmath43 are both stochastically positive .",
    "the reflection positivity of @xmath41 does not follow from the reflection positivity of @xmath40 and @xmath43 due to the non - local effect of @xmath42 .",
    "we will however not need it here .",
    "we thus conclude that for @xmath115 a unique probability measure @xmath116 on @xmath58 with laplace transform @xmath117 exists . here",
    "the perturbation of @xmath116 with an interaction can now be discussed in analogy with the above case  where however the reflection positivity for the perturbed measure remains open , as reflection positivity of the free measure does not necessarily hold .",
    "on the string theory side of the ads / cft correspondence , generating functionals for the boundary theory are calculated fixing boundary conditions at the conformal boundary ( so called dirichlet boundary conditions ) .",
    "little is known about the mathematical properties of such kinds of generating functionals . e.g. their stochastic and reflection",
    "positivity is far from obvious , leaving the linkage to path integrals and relativistic physics open .",
    "it was noticed by dtsch and rehren @xcite that such kinds of generating functionals can however be re - written in terms of ordinary generating functionals , from which the structural properties can be read of in the usual way . these ideas in @xcite have been made fully rigorous in the context of constructive qft .",
    "we will now briefly review these results .",
    "the generating functional @xmath119 , @xmath120 , the space of schwartz functions , in the ads / cft correspondence from a string theoretic point of view can be described as follows : let @xmath65 be some scalar quantum field that is included in the theory ( e.g. the dilaton field ) and let @xmath121 be the ( ir and eventually uv - regularized ) effective potential for that field obtained via integrating out the remaining degrees of freedom ( leaving open the question how such an  integral \" can be defined ) . to simplify the model and for the sake of concreteness we will sometimes assume that @xmath121 is of polynomial type .",
    "formally , @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 are suitably rescaled boundary values of the field @xmath65 and @xmath125 is the heuristic flat measure on the space of all field configurations .",
    "the first step in making this formal expression rigorous is to replace @xmath126 with a well - defined probabilistic path integral .",
    "it turns out that @xmath127 is the right candidate and hence for the moment restriction to @xmath128 is necessary .    in a second step",
    "we have to make sense out of the boundary condition @xmath129 or the functional delta distribution on the boundary values of the field , respectively . using the covariance splitting formula ( [ 2.4eqa ] )",
    "we obtain the splitting @xmath130 , where @xmath131 are the canonical random fields associated with @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the canonical random field associated to the functional measure @xmath134 , i.e. the gaussian measure with generating functional @xmath135 living on the conformal boundary of @xmath12 .",
    "the following step is to construct a finite dimensional approximation @xmath136 of the boundary field @xmath133 by projecting it via a basis expansion to @xmath137 .",
    "thereafter , one can implement the delta distribution as a delta distribution on @xmath137 .",
    "finally one can remove the finite dimensional approximation via a limit @xmath138 .",
    "it turns out that this limit exists and is unique up to a diverging multiplicative constant .",
    "this constant however drops out in the quotient @xmath119 . with the projection to the first @xmath139 terms of the basis expansion denoted by @xmath140 and",
    "@xmath141 a linear mapping from this space to @xmath137 we get @xmath142 @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "one can then show that @xmath146 converges under rather weak continuity requirements on @xmath121 that are fulfilled e.g. for uv - regularized potentials in arbitrary dimension and for @xmath147 potentials without uv cut - offs in @xmath148 .",
    "obviously , the limit does not depend on the details of the finite dimensional approximation .",
    "for the details we refer to @xcite .",
    "we now realize that the right hand side of ( [ 3.3eqa ] ) also makes sense for @xmath149 and we adopt ( [ 3.3eqa ] ) as a definition of ( [ 3.1eqa ] ) .    at this point",
    "one would like to associate a boundary field theory to the generating functional @xmath150 . in order to obtain a functional integral associated to @xmath151",
    "we require that @xmath152 is continuous wrt the schwartz topology , normalized , @xmath153 and stochastically positive , @xmath154 @xmath155 @xmath156 .",
    "furthermore , in order to have a well defined passage from euclidean time to real time qft one requires reflection positivity @xmath157 @xmath155 @xmath158 . here",
    "finally , the theory obtained at the boundary should be conformally invariant , provided the ir cut - off @xmath84 is removed from @xmath121 via taking the limit of the generating functionals wrt the net @xmath94 .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that an alternative representation of the functional ( [ 3.3eqa ] ) answers a number of the questions raised above .",
    "let @xmath160 be the canonical random field associated with the measure @xmath57 .",
    "the idea is to smear @xmath161 in the @xmath112-variable with a test function @xmath162 and then scale @xmath163 . in the light of ( [ 2.1eqa ] )",
    ", one has to multiply @xmath164 with a factor @xmath165 in order to obtain a finite result in the limit .",
    "we set @xmath166 clearly , under the conditions on @xmath121 given in the preceding section and for @xmath167 , @xmath168 defines a continuous , normalized , stochastically positive and reflection positive generating functional for all @xmath169 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath170 is in the cameron - martin space of the measure @xmath57 , one gets with @xmath171 , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xmath172 we now want to take the limit @xmath26 . using ( [ 2.2eqa ] ) one can show under rather weak continuity requirements on @xmath121 that the functional integral on the rhs of ( [ 3.5eqa ] ) converges to @xmath173",
    ". the prefactor however diverges .",
    "the reason is that the limit in ( [ 2.3eqa ] ) is only a pointwise limit for @xmath174 and not a limit in the sense of tempered distributions .",
    "one can however show that @xcite @xmath175 @xmath176 @xmath177}z^{-2(\\nu - j)}(-1)^ja_j\\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^{d}}|\\hat{f}(k)|^2|k|^{2j}dk.\\ ] ] @xmath178 here @xmath179 .",
    "thus , the right hand side of ( [ 3.5eqa ] ) multiplied with @xmath180 converges and we obtain the limiting functional @xmath181}\\int_{\\mathcal d'}e^{-v_\\lambda(\\phi+g_+f_z)}d\\mu_{g_+}(\\phi)/{y}_z(0)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & e^{\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha_+(f , f)}\\frac{\\int_{\\mathcal d'}e^{-v_\\lambda(\\phi+h_+f)}d\\mu_{g_+}(\\phi)}{\\int_{\\mathcal d'}e^{-v_\\lambda(\\phi)}d\\mu_{g_+}(\\phi)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this , together with @xmath182 , establishes the crucial identity @xcite @xmath183 let us now investigate the structural properties of the generating functional @xmath184 .",
    "if there were not the correction factor @xmath185 , @xmath186 would be stochastically positive and reflection positive as the limit of functionals with that property , since we can combine ( [ 3.7eqa ] ) and @xmath187 for a representation of @xmath152 .",
    "due to the signs in ( [ 3.6eqa ] ) @xmath188 is not stochastically positive and consequently the stochastic positivity of @xmath189 is at least unclear .",
    "hence we do not have any reason to believe that the limiting functional @xmath152 is stochastically positive and can be associated with a probabilistic functional integral .",
    "an exception is the case where @xmath190 where we can dwell on the fact that @xmath191 is manifestly stochastically positive since @xmath192 with @xmath193 .",
    "it is therefore questionable if one can use the ads / cft correspondence to generate conformally invariant models in statistical mechanics .",
    "we next investigate the question of reflection positivity .",
    "since the correlation length of the distributional kernels of @xmath194 is zero , we get that @xmath195 for @xmath196 . consequently , @xmath197 and @xmath84 such that @xmath198 we get @xmath199 with @xmath200 . for a proof that the reflection positivity of generating functionals implies the reflection positivity of schwinger functions @xcite also in the absence of stochastic positivity , cf . @xcite . as in @xcite , we thus come to the conclusion that the crucial property for the existence of a relativistic theory is preserved in the ads / cft correspondence .    finally we address the invariance properties of the limiting generating functional @xmath152 . for being the generating functional of a cft , we require invariance under conformal transformations , i.e. @xmath201 @xmath202 where @xmath203 is an element of the conformal group on @xmath24 and @xmath204 certainly , as long as an interaction with ir cut - off is included in the definition of @xmath205 , conformal invariance can not hold . using the identification of @xmath100 and the conformal group on @xmath24",
    ", we get that @xmath42 intertwines the respective representations on function spaces , i.e. @xcite @xmath206 combining this , the conformal invariance of @xmath207 under the given representation of the conformal group and ( [ 3.3eqa ] ) we obtain @xmath208 hence , if the generating functionals @xmath209 have a unique limit @xmath152 wrt the net @xmath94 , then @xmath152 is reflection positive and conformally invariant and hence is the generating functional of a boundary cft .",
    "in this section we investigate the net limit of @xmath210 which is needed to establish the full ads / cft correspondence . this problem has been left open in @xcite and we will show that this kind of ir problem behaves somewhat wired .",
    "the reason is the following : when we identified the generating functionals @xmath211 and @xmath212 , we have seen from the latter functional that it originated from a usual qft generating functional with @xmath213 giving rise to a source term which needs to be considered in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "as ( [ 3.6eqa ] ) shows , this source term corresponds to an interaction of an  exterior field \" with the quantum field @xmath65 which , already for the free field , has zero expectation but infinite fluctuations in the limit @xmath26 . without any correction term , this would have led to a generating functional which converges to zero for any @xmath214 .",
    "we already then needed an ultra - local correction term to deal with the prescribed infinite energy fluctuations .",
    "if we now switch on the interaction , a shift term @xmath215 in the bulk theory is generated , cf .",
    "( [ 3.7eqa ] ) .",
    "if we e.g. restrict to polynomial interactions , this shift leads to re - defined @xmath111-dependent couplings that diverge towards the conformal boundary .",
    "this again leads to an an infinite energy transfer and it is probable that this infinite amount of energy plays havoc with the generating functional . here",
    "we will show that in some situations this indeed happens .",
    "let us first investigate the behavior of the shift @xmath215 towards the conformal boundary .",
    "let @xmath216 be such that @xmath217 .",
    "choosing spherical coordinates , we denote by @xmath218 the integral of @xmath219 over the angular coordinates .",
    "we get from ( [ 2.2eqa ] ) via a change of coordinates @xmath220 and we see that the integral on the rhs converges to @xmath221 , hence @xmath222 if @xmath223 by translation invariance .",
    "let us now work with the generating functional as defined by ( [ 3.7eqa ] ) .",
    "the prefactor on the rhs is independent of @xmath84 , hence we have to investigate the behavior of @xmath224 we restrict ourselves to the simplest possible case - an ultra - violet regularized @xmath225 potential in arbitrary dimensions @xmath7 @xmath226 where @xmath227 denotes the random field @xmath65 with uv - cut off @xmath228 . due to this cut - off ,",
    "the locality axiom in section 2 will in general be violated .",
    "this however does not matter in the following discussion .",
    "we furthermore require that @xmath229 $ ] is a bounded function in @xmath18 and @xmath230 .",
    "@xmath231 stands for the expectation wrt @xmath57 .",
    "the wick ordering in ( [ 4.2eqa ] ) is taken wrt @xmath40 , for simplicity .",
    "the shifted potential then is given by @xmath232 taking the expected value of the shifted potential wrt @xmath57 , one obtains @xmath233 @xmath234 which in the light of ( [ 4.1eqa ] ) clearly diverges as @xmath235 whenever @xmath214 .",
    "let us now focus on a specific class of cut - offs of the form @xmath236\\times[-l , l]^{\\times d}$ ] where we keep @xmath237 arbitrarily large but fixed .",
    "let @xmath238 .",
    "since @xmath239 we obtain the scaling of the expected shifted interaction energy @xmath240=\\lambda \\int_{[z_0,a]}\\int_{[-l , l]^{\\times d } } ( h_+f)^4 ( z , x ) \\,dx z^{-d-1 } dz\\nonumber\\\\ & \\sim &    z_0^{-d-4(\\delta_+-d)}~~{\\rm as}~~z_0\\to0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us next investigate the fluctuations in the shifted energy as @xmath241 . denoting the standard deviation of @xmath242 with @xmath243 , we obtain using ( [ 4.3eqa ] ) and @xmath244=a!\\,\\delta_{a , b}g^\\kappa_+({\\underline{x}},{\\underline{y}})^a$ ] , @xmath245 , @xmath246^{1/2}\\\\&\\sim & z_0^{-d-3(\\delta_+-d)}~~{\\rm or ~slower~as}~~z_0\\to 0,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we took the factors @xmath247 out of the integral and replaced them with a majorizing constant in order to obtain an upper bound on the scaling .",

    "\\(iii ) the mass bound to us rather seems to be a technical consequence of the methods used and not so much a true necessity for the onset of triviality .",
    "different methods , e.g. based on decoupling via dirichlet- and neumann boundary conditions on a partition of @xmath12 @xcite e.g. combined with large deviation methods might very well lead to less restrictive mass bounds or eliminate them completely .    on a heuristic level , the problem that expectation and variance of the shifted potential and the non shifted potential will have different scalings under the limit @xmath285 prevails for a large class of polynomial and non - polynomial interactions with and without cut - offs .",
    "thus , in our eyes , the three assumptions ( i)(iii ) are not essential but rather technical .",
    "the result above therefore should be taken rather as an example of what can happen in the ads / cft correspondence than a definite mathematical statement .",
    "of course , at the present and very preliminary state of the affair , everybody is free to think differently .",
    "in this section we give an essentially non - technical discussion on repair strategies that would cure the obstacle of triviality .",
    "\\(i ) coupling constant renormalization : the simplest way to deal with the divergences in the potential energy @xmath242 would be to make @xmath286 a @xmath272-dependent quantity .",
    "in fact , a naive guess at the scaling behavior suggests that @xmath287 would compensate for the increase in the expected value of the interaction energy @xmath242 such that with the modified coupling @xmath288=\\lambda c\\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^d}f^4\\ , dx$ ] converges to a constant with @xmath289 , cf .",
    "( [ 4.1eqa ] ) and the paragraph thereafter .",
    "furthermore , one can expect that the subleading terms ( @xmath290 in ( [ 4.3eqa ] ) ) converge to zero and do not affect the generating functional .",
    "it thus seems reasonable that with this renormalization the generating functional gives in the limit @xmath262 @xmath291 which is reflection positive as a limit of reflection positive functionals ( it is manifestly not stochastically positive for all @xmath292 and hence gives a nice illustration for the destruction of stochastic positivity due to the correction term in ( [ 3.6eqa ] ) and ( [ 3.7eqa ] ) .",
    "the problem with this functional however is that the additional term in the interaction is an ultra local term and hence does not influence the corresponding real time cft  which is a free theory determined by the analytic continuation of @xmath207 .",
    "hence this sort of renormalization only trades in another kind of triviality for the triviality observed in section 4 .",
    "\\(ii ) bulk counterterms : such terms can simply be added to the ( formal ) lagrangian . the problem to use this method in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence is twofold : firstly , the infra - red divergences that are occurring in @xmath242 are @xmath111-dependent .",
    "if we however want to cure them with @xmath111-dependent counterterms , the renormalization description of @xmath293 becomes @xmath111-dependent .",
    "bulk counterterms however only preserve the structural properties of stochastic and reflection positivity , if the same renormalization prescription is chosen for all @xmath111 . hence , @xmath111-dependent counterterms would lead to a limiting functional , for which it is not known , whether it is reflection positive or not .",
    "the situation is worsened from the observation that , unlike in other ir problems , in the ads / cft correspondence the divergences in the nominator and denominator scale differently - as seen in our triviality result .",
    "this means for bulk counterterms , that , if they are working out fine for the nominator , they probably create new divergences in the denominator .",
    "different renormalizations for the potential in the nominator and in the denominator in the limit might lead to a non normalizable vacuum for the boundary theory , which does not make sense .",
    "\\(iii ) boundary counterterms : the problems described above for bulk counterterms also have to be taken into account for boundary counterterms . furthermore , while bulk counterterms , at least if they are not @xmath111-dependent , do not spoil the conformal invariance of the boundary theory , boundary counterterms theoretically might do so . hence one needs a separate argument to show that they do nt .",
    "but there is still another problem with boundary counterterms .",
    "we have seen that we can not take it for granted that a limiting functional measure exists for the boundary theory .",
    "but if the boundary theory is not described by a functional integral @xmath294 , it is not clear how to define boundary counterterms on a mathematical basis : recall that a counterterm ( at a finite value of the cut - off @xmath272 is defined by @xmath295 and it is not obvious how this can be defined if @xmath294 is not a measure .",
    "\\(iv ) giving up generating functionals : the triviality result of section 4 relied on the scaling behavior of the expected value of @xmath242 under the limit @xmath262 .",
    "this expected value can be associated with the witten graph @xmath296 which gives rise to the first order contribution to the four point function @xmath297 which is converging as long as @xmath298 if @xmath299 , cf ( [ 2.2eqa ] ) and ( [ 4.1eqa ] ) ( see also @xcite for concrete calculations ) .",
    "one may thus hope that the triviallity result of section 4 is an artefact of using generating functionals which makes it necessary to evaluate schwinger functions at unphysical coinciding points .",
    "a reasonable approach to the infra - red problem in ads / cft would thus be to use ( [ 3.7eqa ] ) to define reflection positive schwinger functions with cut off and then remove the cut - off for the schwinger functions at physical ( non coinciding ) points , only .",
    "this might then work out without further renormalization along the lines of @xcite , as divergences might only occur on the diagonal .",
    "if this is true , triviality does only occur on the level of generating functionals  which are reminiscent of the laplace transform of a functional measure for the boundary theory that might not exist in the present context .",
