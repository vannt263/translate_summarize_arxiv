    "it is a well established fact that matter exists in different states . for strongly interacting matter at least three are expected : normal nuclear matter ( liquid ) , hadron gas ( hg ) , and a system of deconfined quarks and gluons ( eventually the quark - gluon plasma ) .",
    "one of the most important goals of high - energy heavy - ion collisions is to establish the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter by finding the possible phase boundaries and critical points . in principle , we want to produce the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and analyze its properties and the transition between qgp and hg .    the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter ( fig .  [ phas_full ] )",
    "is most often presented in terms of temperature @xmath66 and baryochemical potential @xmath67 .",
    "it is believed that for large values of @xmath67 the phase transition is of the first order ( gray band ) and for low @xmath67 values a rapid but continuous transition ( cross - over ) .",
    "a critical point of second order ( cp ) separates those two regions .",
    "the open points in fig .",
    "[ phas_full ] are hypothetical locations reached by the high - density matter droplet after dissipation of the energy of the incident nucleons from where the evolution of the expanding and cooling fireball starts .",

    "na49 @xcite , operating in 1994 - 2002 , was one of the fixed target heavy - ion experiments at the cern sps .",
    "the main components of the detector were four large volume time projection chambers ( tpc ) .",
    "the vertex tpcs ( vtpc-1 and vtpc-2 ) , were located in the magnetic field of two super - conducting dipole magnets .",
    "two other tpcs ( mtpc - l and mtpc - r ) were positioned downstream of the magnets symmetrically to the beam line .",
    "the na49 tpcs allowed precise measurements of particle momenta @xmath69 with a resolution of @xmath70 ( gev / c)@xmath71 .",
    "a precise measurement of specific energy loss ( @xmath72 ) in the region of relativistic rise was possible in the tpcs .",
    "time of flight ( tof ) walls supplemented particle identification close to mid - rapidity .",
    "the typical @xmath72 resolution was @xmath73 , the typical tof resolution @xmath74  ps , and invariant mass resolution ( for identification of particles via decay topology ) was @xmath75 mev .",
    "the centrality of nuclear collisions was selected via measurement of the energy of the projectile spectator nucleons in the forward calorimeter .",
    "the na49 acceptance covers the forward hemisphere , but because of the symmetry of nucleus+nucleus ( @xmath76 ) collisions this nevertheless allows to extract @xmath77 integrated multiplicities .",
    "in 2002 the na49 experiment completed the sps energy scan of central @xmath1 collisions .",
    "this program was originally motivated by predictions of the statistical model of the early stage ( smes ) @xcite assuming that the energy threshold for deconfinement ( the lowest energy sufficient to create a partonic system ) is located at low sps energies .",
    "several structures were expected within smes : the kink in pion production ( due to increased entropy production ) , the horn in the strangeness to entropy ratio , and the step in the inverse slope parameter of transverse momentum spectra ( constant temperature and pressure in a mixed phase ) .",
    "figure  [ kink ] shows production of charged pions ( the total entropy is carried mainly by pions ) @xmath78 normalized to the number of wounded nucleons versus fermi variable @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) . in smes ,",
    "this ratio is proportional to the effective number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath81 ) to the power of 1/4 . for central @xmath76 collisions ( @xmath1 for sps or @xmath82 for ags and rhic ) a change of slope around 30@xmath83",
    "gev is visible ( slope in @xmath76 increases from @xmath84 1 ( ags ) to @xmath84 1.3 ( top sps+rhic ) - consistent with increase by a factor of 3 in @xmath81 ) .",
    "such an increase is not observed for @xmath85 reactions .",
    "the increase in @xmath81 , when going from hadron gas to qgp , may be interpreted as a consequence of the activation of partonic degrees of freedom .",

    "this peak is even more pronounced at mid - rapidity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , these intriguing na49 results on pion and kaon yields ( at mid - rapidity ) were confirmed at @xmath91 = 9.2 gev and 19.6 gev by the star experiment @xcite .",

    "the latest extension of the hgm @xcite yields and improves fit of the energy dependence @xmath94 by inclusion of controversial @xcite @xmath95 state and _ unmeasured _ resonances above 3 gev in the model hadron spectrum ( see conference slides or @xcite ) .    the measure which much better reflects the total strangeness to entropy ratio in the sps energy range is @xmath96 , proposed in ref .",

    ". the @xmath87 ratio can be directly and quantitatively compared to smes predictions . figure  [ horn ] ( right ) shows a distinct peak in @xmath87 at 30@xmath83 gev .",
    "this behavior is described ( predicted ) only by the model assuming a phase transition ( i.e. smes ) , where the maximum , called horn , is the result of the decrease of strangeness carrier masses in the qgp ( @xmath100 ) and the change in the number of degrees of freedom when reaching the deconfined state .",

    "the plateau is consistent with constant temperature and pressure in the mixed phase ( latent heat ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , this structure strongly resembles the behavior of water , where a plateau can be observed in the temperature when heat is added .",
    "models without phase transition do not reproduce the @xmath76 data , but a hydrodynamical model incorporating a deconfinement phase transition at sps energies @xcite describes the results in fig",
