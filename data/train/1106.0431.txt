    "the anti de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite provides a powerful theoretical method to investigate the strongly coupled field theories .",
    "it may have useful applications in condensed matter physics , especially for studying scale - invariant strongly - coupled systems , for example , low temperature systems near quantum criticality ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that the ads / cft correspondence also can be used to describe superconductor phase transition @xcite .",
    "since the high @xmath11 superconductors are shown to be in the strong coupling regime , the bcs theory fails and one expects that the holographic method could give some insights into the pairing mechanism in the high @xmath11 superconductors .",
    "various holographic superconductors have been studied in einstein theory @xcite or extended versions as gauss - bonnet ( gb)@xcite and even in horava - lifshitz theory @xcite .",
    "ads / cft can also describe superfluid states in which the condensing operator is a vector and hence rotational symmetry is broken , that is , p - wave superfluid states @xcite . here",
    "the cft has a global @xmath12 symmetry and hence three conserved currents @xmath13 , where @xmath14 label the generators of @xmath12 .",
    "all these works are based on a numerical analysis of the equations on motion ( eom ) near the horizon and the asymptotic limit by a suitable shooting method .",
    "but as we know the analytical methods are better and easy for invoking in different problems .",
    "the first pioneering work on analytic methods in this topic was the hertzog s work @xcite .",
    "he showed that at least in probe limit , by solving equations analytically , one can obtain the critical exponent and the expectation values of the dual operators .",
    "the philosophy hidden behind his calculations is perturbation theory . near the critical point the value of the scalar field @xmath15 is small and consequently we can treat the expectation values of the dual boundary operators @xmath16 as a perturbation parameter .",
    "this method has been used recently by kanno for investigating the gb superconductors even away from the probe limit @xcite . applying the analytical methods",
    "has been extended to new trends ( see for example @xcite and the references in it ) . in @xcite the authors have shown that one can obtain the critical exponent and the critical temperature by applying a variational method on the eom . their method and terminology is simple and very sound . instead of involving in numerical problems ,",
    "we can obtain the critical temperature @xmath11 and the exponent of the criticality very easily by computing a simple variational approach .",
    "they studied different modes of super criticality s - wave , p - wave and even d - wave .",
    "thus as we know , there is two major method for analytical study of superconductors : _ the small parameter perturbation theory _ as used by @xcite and the _ variational method _",
    "we must attend that , the variational method , which has been used in the present work , gives only the minimum value of the critical temperature @xmath1 for a model with a typical parameter .",
    "for example if we focus on weyl corrections to holographic superconductors , as it has been shown in @xcite , for a large range of the coupling value @xmath17 , there is a universal relation for the critical temperature @xmath18{\\rho}$ ] .",
    "the proportionality constant depends on the weyl coupling @xmath19 and can be computed using the numerical methods .",
    "there is a low limit of superconductivity with critical temperature @xmath3{\\rho}$ ] corresponds to the value @xmath4 .",
    "specially recently there are many interests on gb and weyl corrected superconductors which in them , one is working with a corrected bh .",
    "the holographic superconductors with weyl corrections has been studied recently @xcite .",
    "they studied the problem numerically .",
    "our program in this paper is studying the weyl corrections to the superconductors analytically .",
    "our plan is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we construct the basic model of the 3 + 1 holographic superconductor with weyl corrections . in section 3",
    "we present the analytical results for the condensation and minimum value of the critical temperature for different scaling and the critical exponent @xmath20 via variational bound .",
    "conclusions and discussions follow in section 4 .",
    "the s - wave holographic superconductors can be constructed from a u(1 ) scalar gauge field coupled to a massive charged scalar field ( complex field ) .",
    "the simplest form of the action in five dimensions ( 3 + 1 holographic picture ) with weyl corrections , in units in which the ads radius l=1 , charge @xmath21 , reads@xcite    @xmath22    here @xmath23 is the gravitational constant , the ( 12 ) term gives the negative cosmological constant , @xmath24 and as the usual @xmath25 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath26 lives in bulk and produces a conserved current @xmath27 .",
    "this current corresponds to a _ global u(1 ) symmetry_.    about the action ( 1 ) we can say that _ since the background geometry will be an einstein metric , we will argue that there is a unique tensorial structure correcting the maxwell term at leading order in derivatives , arising from a coupling to the weyl tensor and leading to the dimension - six operator in ( 1 ) parametrized by the constant @xmath19 .",
    "other curvature couplings simply provide constant shifts when considering linearized gauge field fluctuations about the background_. there is another reason for considering the weyl correction , which is related to the quantum corrections : in any background in which additional charged matter fields are integrated out below their mass threshold , the weyl coupling @xmath28 is generated at 1-loop , with a coefficient @xmath29 first computed ( for four dimension ) by drummond and hathrell @xcite .",
    "the weyl s coupling @xmath19 is limited such that it s value is in the interval @xmath17 . in probe limit ,",
    "we neglect from the back reactions and in this case , the gravity sector is effectively decoupled from the matter field s sector . in this probe limit",
    ", the exact solution for einstein - yang mills equations is b black brain given by @xmath30 here @xmath31 and the a horizon locates at @xmath32 .",
    "this solution is asymptotically anti - de sitter .",
    "the temperature of the dual conformal field theory ( cft ) is nothing just the hawking temperature and reads @xmath33 .",
    "when the temperature of the black brane falls below a critical value @xmath11 , it happens a phase transition between the normal phase and a new phase , in which the scalar field @xmath15 condenses .",
    "if the model has such a solution , we state that our field theory has a superfluid phase .",
    "we choose a gauge as @xmath34 .",
    "it is more conveint to work in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath35 , in which the horizon is @xmath36 and the boundary at infinity locates at @xmath37 . the resulting yang - mills equations @xmath38\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for metric ( 2 ) are given by @xmath39 where prime now denotes derivative with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "also we fix the mass of the scalar field to @xmath41 which is obviously above the breitenlohner - freedman bound @xcite .",
    "the adequate and sufficient boundary conditions for these equations can be written on horizon @xmath36 , the bulk s boundary @xmath37 .",
    "on the horizon we ve @xmath42 and on the boundary of bulk , the following asymptotic forms of the solutions must be existed @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath9 are dual to the chemical potential and charge density of the boundary cft , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are dual to the source and expectation value of the boundary operator @xmath47 respectively and @xmath48 are the condensation with dimension @xmath49 where the dimension @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 the conformal scaling dimension @xmath51 is related to the mass and the de sitter radius by @xmath52 .",
    "we know that there is a second order continuous phase transition at the critical temperature , the solution of the eoms ( 4,5 ) at @xmath11 is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the radius of the horizon at @xmath55 . as @xmath56 ,",
    "the scalar filed s eom tends to the following form @xmath57    here @xmath58 . by solving the equation of ( 10 ) , we can obtain the value of @xmath11 . to match the behavior at the boundary , we can define @xmath59    where , according to eq.(7 ) , @xmath60 is normalized as @xmath61 .",
    "we deduce    @xmath62    when @xmath63 , @xmath64 should be finite , so this equation is to be solved subject to the boundary condition @xmath65 .",
    "now we use from the variation method to solve the sturm - liouville problem ( 12 ) .",
    "the sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem is to solve the equation @xcite @xmath66 - q(\\xi)\\omega(\\xi ) + \\lambda^2\\rho(\\xi)\\omega(\\xi ) = 0   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with boundary condition @xmath67 the sturm - liouville problem can be result to be a functional minimize problem @xmath68 = \\frac{\\int ^1 _ 0 d\\xi(k(\\xi)\\omega ' ( \\xi ) ^2 + q(\\xi)\\omega(\\xi ) ^2)}{\\int ^1 _ 0 d\\xi\\rho(\\xi)\\omega(\\xi)^ 2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then th eigenvalue @xmath69 can also be obtained by variation eq .",
    "this eigenvalue is the minimum value of a sequence of the eigenvalues @xmath70 i.e. we obtain @xmath71 .",
    "it is a familiar result from the functional theory . for eq.(12 ) we immediately obtain @xmath72 the boundary condition ( 14 ) is very serious for our computational settings .",
    "we will discuss two different cases @xmath73 separately . in each case",
    ", we will chose different kind of the trial function @xmath74 .",
    "if we fix @xmath75 , then the boundary condition ( 14 ) reads as @xmath76 in right boundary point @xmath36 it is satisfied clearly .",
    "for left point @xmath37 we must be careful . indeed",
    "to have @xmath77 , the eigenfunction @xmath74 must be non singular .",
    "additionally , we impose the auxiliary conditions on it s value at left point of the interval @xmath78 $ ] . in order to use the variation method",
    ", we have to specifies the trial eigenfunction @xmath74 .",
    "we impose the auxiliary boundary conditions @xmath79 and @xmath65 .",
    "the third order trial eigenfunction is then     for the case @xmath75,width=377 ]    @xmath80    we obtain @xmath81 which attains its minimum at @xmath82 .",
    "we obtain @xmath83 for the case @xmath75 .",
    "the _ minimum _ critical temperature @xmath1 is @xmath84{\\frac{\\rho}{\\lambda}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so for @xmath85 , @xmath86{\\rho}$ ] , which is in very good agreement with the numerical value @xmath3{\\rho}$ ] for @xmath4 of table ( 1 ) in @xcite .",
    "in fact , this analytical calculation can be done even better if we include higher order of @xmath40 . however ,",
    "for qualitative analyze , the third order trial eigenfunction is good enough and we use it .",
    "now we fix @xmath87 , then the boundary condition ( 14 ) reads as @xmath88    the second order trial eigenfunction satisfying the @xmath89 is then    @xmath90    now we obtain    @xmath91    it results @xmath92 .",
    "now we examine @xmath93 in functional ( 15 ) which attains its minimum at @xmath94 .",
    "we obtain    @xmath95 , @xmath96{\\rho}$ ] .",
    "this value for critical temperature corresponds to the value of the @xmath6 from numerical solving given by @xcite .",
    "the figure ( 2 ) shows the variation of @xmath97 with respect to @xmath40 .     for the case @xmath87,width=377 ]",
    "now we begin to solve the equation for @xmath98 to obtain the behavior of the order parameter at @xmath11 .",
    "away from ( but close to ) the critical temperature , the field eq.(5 ) for @xmath98 becomes    @xmath99\\varphi   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the parameter @xmath100 is small .",
    "because near the critical chemical @xmath101 , the condensation of the operator is very small , we can expand @xmath98 in @xmath102 as @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the general correction function to be @xmath105 .",

    "near @xmath37 , @xmath111 can be expanded as @xmath112 comparing the coefficients of @xmath113 term in both sides of the above formula , we get @xmath114 besides , from the @xmath115 term in ( 31 ) , we obtain that @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , from the equation ( 29 ) and the boundary conditions of @xmath117 , we can solve @xmath104 to be @xmath118 here , @xmath119 both are the integration constants .",
