    "classical continuum mechanics considers material continua as simple point - continua with points having three displacement - degrees of freedom , and the response of a material to the displacement of its points is characterized by a symmetric cauchy stress tensor presupposing that the transmission of loads through surface elements is uniquely determined by a force vector , neglecting couples .",
    "but such a model is insufficient for the description of deformable solids with a certain microstructure , such as cellular materials , foam - like structures ( e.g. , bones ) , periodic lattices .",
    "that is the point where the geometrically nonlinear cosserat model comes in .",
    "+ in order to unify field theories embracing mechanics , optics and electro - dynamics by means of a common principle of least action ( euclidean action ) , the brothers francois and eugene cosserat tried to find the correct general form of the energy for a deformable solid ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the classical theory any material point in a cosserat continuum ( also called _ micropolar _",
    "continuum ) is allowed to rotate without stretch , like an infinitesimal rigid body .",
    "thus , in addition to the deformation field @xmath13 an independent rotation field @xmath14 is needed to fully describe the generalized continuum .",
    "the cosserat model has therefore 6 degrees of freedom ( 3 for the displacements and 3 for the rotations of points ) , in contrast to the classical elastic continuum , which has only 3 degrees of freedom .",
    "+ from a historical perspective , the kinematical model of such generalized continua was introduced by the cosserat brothers in @xcite , but they did not provide any constitutive relations .",
    "fifty years later , ericksen and truesdell @xcite have developed this idea and have drawn anew the attention to the theory of generalized continua . in the 1960s ,",
    "several variants of the theory of media with microstructure were proposed by toupin @xcite , mindlin @xcite , eringen @xcite and others . the micropolar ( or cosserat )",
    "continua can be viewed as a special case of the microstretch continua and of the micromorphic continua ( see eringen @xcite for the foundation of this theory ) . in the last decades ,",
    "the generalized theories of continua have proven useful for the treatment of complex mechanical problems , for which the classical theory of elasticity is not satisfactory . in this respect ,",
    "we mention for instance the works of lakes @xcite , neff @xcite , neff and forest @xcite , among others .",
    "+ the mathematical problem related to the deformation of cosserat elastic bodies has been investigated in many works . in the linearized micropolar",
    "elasticity the existence and the properties of solutions have been studied by iean @xcite and by neff @xcite under some weaker assumptions , among others . for the geometrically nonlinear micromorphic model ,",
    "the first existence theorem based on convexity arguments was presented by neff @xcite . another existence result for generalized continua with microstructure",
    "was proved in @xcite , under certain convexity assumptions .",
    "adapting the methods from @xcite , tambaa and veli @xcite have derived an existence theorem for nonlinear micropolar elasticity , for a general constitutive behaviour . + in our paper we consider a new energy formulation of geometrically nonlinear cosserat models which completely separates the effects of nonsymmetric straining and curvature .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the strain measures and curvature strain measures associated to the classical nonlinear cosserat model .",
    "the next section presents the expression of the elastically stored energy density and recalls the main assumptions on the constitutive coefficients .",
    "+ in section [ sec4 ] we provide an easy and self contained approach towards compatibility conditions in micropolar media . starting point is valle s formula ( theorem [ th : comp1 ] ) providing compatibility relations generated by the classical polar decomposition .",
    "as it turns out , this formula can be generalized to the situation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is still orthogonal , but @xmath6 need not be positive definite and symmetric . our final compatibility result is already known .",
    "indeed , teresi and tiero ( cf .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( 22 ) ) use a much more abstract setting with an extremely short algebraic proof as compared to the classical , componentwise approach ( cf .",
    "their result seems not to be very well known and it has not been immediately connected to the classical compatibility result for the symmetric stretch tensor . in our presentation",
    "we choose a compact direct tensor notation which is a middle between the two extreme cases above .",
    "the advantage of teresi and tiero s analysis is , however , to make the structure more transparent and to highlight the appearance of the curl of the first cosserat deformation tensor .",
    "this dependence is not easily grasped in the compatibility conditions given in the classical approach ( see @xcite and eringen s book @xcite , eq .",
    "+ having proven these relations between dislocation density @xmath17 , strain measure @xmath6 and its derivative in the form of @xmath18 , in section [ sec5 ] we finally give the new energy formulation and briefly outline a proof for the existence of minimizers .      in this paper ,",
