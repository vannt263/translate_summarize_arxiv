    "the discovery of a ( singly ) charged higgs boson would signal the existence of a second higgs doublet in addition to the standard model ( sm)-like one already established through the discovery of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bosons at the s@xmath15s in the eighties and of a higgs boson itself at the lhc only four years ago .",
    "such a scalar field can naturally be accommodated in 2-higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) . in its cp - conserving versions ,",
    "they present in their spectra , after spontaneous electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , five physical higgs states : the neutral pseudoscalar ( @xmath16 ) , the lightest ( @xmath17 ) and heaviest ( @xmath18 ) neutral scalars and two charged ones ( @xmath19 ) .    of all 2hdm yukawa types ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , we concentrate here on the 2hdm type ii ( 2hdm - ii ) . herein , constraints from @xmath6 decays put a lower limit on the @xmath19 mass at about 480 gev , rather independently of @xmath20  @xcite , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two doublets .",
    "such a heavy mass region is very difficult to access because of the large reducible and irreducible backgrounds associated with the main decay mode @xmath1 , following the dominant production channel @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "( notice that the rate of the latter exceeds by far other possible production modes @xcite@xcite , thus rendering it the only viable channel at the cern machine in the heavy mass region . )",
    "the analysis of the @xmath1 signature has been the subject of many early debates @xcite@xcite , their conclusion being that the lhc discovery potential might be satisfactory , so long that @xmath20 is small ( @xmath22 ) or large ( @xmath23 ) enough and the charged higgs boson mass is below 600 gev or so .",
    "such positive prospects have very recently been revived by an atlas analysis of the full run 1 sample @xcite , which searched precisely for the aforementioned @xmath19 production and decay modes , by exploring the mass range 200 to 600 gev using multi - jet final states with one electron or muon .",
    "this study used multivariate analysis techniques in the signal - rich region while it employed control regions to reduce the large uncertainties on the backgrounds .",
    "an excess of data with respect to the sm predictions was observed for all @xmath19 mass hypotheses up to ( but excluding ) 600 gev . while cms does not confirm such an excess @xcite , the increased sensitivity that the two experiments are accruing with the first run 2 data calls for a renewed interest in this respect .    in this spirit , and recognising that the @xmath1 decay channel eventually produces a @xmath24 signature , ref .",
    "@xcite attempted to extend the reach afforded by this channel by exploiting the companion signature @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath24 , where @xmath27 is the sm - like higgs boson discovered at cern in 2012 ( either @xmath17 or @xmath18 in 2hdms ) .",
    "the knowledge of its mass now provides in fact an additional handle in the kinematic selection when reconstructing a breit - wigner resonance in the @xmath28 decay channel , thereby significantly improving the signal - to - background ratio afforded by pre - higgs - discovery analyses @xcite .",
    "such a study found that , while this channel does not show much promise for a supersymmetric @xmath19 state , significant portions of the parameter spaces of several 2hdms are testable at run 2 .",
    "spurred by the aforementioned experimental results and building on ref .",
    "@xcite , we intend to study here all intermediate decay channels of a heavy @xmath19 state yielding a @xmath0 signature , i.e. , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , starting from the production mode @xmath4 + c.c . in doing so",
    ", we take into account interference effects between these four channels , in the calculation of the total @xmath19 width as well as of the total yield in the cumulative @xmath0 final state ( wherein the @xmath13 decays leptonically ) , with the aim of maximising the experimental sensitivity of atlas and cms across them all .",
    "as intimated , we consider a 2hdm - ii , as this uniquely predicts , amongst the various types , a heavy charged higgs boson mass for consistency with flavour data .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and define its available parameter space based on current experimental and theoretical constraints",
    ". then we proceed to a signal - to - background analysis .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions based on the results obtained .",
    "in order to discuss searches for the heavy @xmath19 state yielding a @xmath0 signature we use as a benchmark model the 2hdm - ii where the charged higgs mass is constrained to be above 480 gev due to @xmath29-physics constraints . also , since we want to maximise the number of intermediate states that lead to @xmath0 , we choose the heavy cp - even scalar to be the sm - like 125 gev one . this way , and by considering a light pseudoscalar , the decays @xmath30 are all possible , together with the @xmath31 intermediate state .",
    "for such a heavy charged higgs boson ( with a mass above the top - quark one ) , the main production mechanism is @xmath32 , which depends strongly on @xmath33 .",
    "as we will discuss , the constraints from run 1 force this scenario to be allowed only for low @xmath33 values .",
    "allowed points on the @xmath34 versus @xmath20 plane after the lhc run 1 . ]",
    "we consider as free parameters of the model the four masses , @xmath33 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the rotation angle in the cp - even sector , and the soft breaking parameter @xmath37 . in the configurations yielding @xmath38 gev , 2hdms , together with all theoretical and experimental constraints ,",
    "were recently studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the parameter space of 2hdms is already very constrained by the lhc results obtained during the 7 and 8 tev runs . in figure",

    "the charged higgs boson has several decay channels kinematically allowed and with sizeable branching ratios ( brs ) . in figure  [ fig : br_2hdmii ] we present all possible @xmath19 decay brs for various @xmath20 and @xmath51 choices .",
    "clearly , because the scalars masses were chosen such that @xmath52 ( @xmath53 being @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) , the decays @xmath56 decays dominate over the @xmath31 mode for a large portion of the parameter space .",
    "we recall here that in 2hdms the charged higgs couplings to a neutral scalar and a @xmath13 boson are @xmath57 while couplings to quarks",
    "are yukawa type dependent although they depend only on @xmath33 . if @xmath17 is the sm - like higgs , then the lhc data forces @xmath58 while if @xmath18 is sm - like then @xmath59",
    "thus , in both cases , the charged higgs boson couples more strongly to non - sm - like higgs states than to the sm - like one .",
    "unfortunately , this means that it is not possible to effectively search for @xmath19 in the @xmath60 mode via the intermediate sm - like higgs boson exploiting its invariant mass reconstruction around 125 gev . as we have chosen @xmath18 to be the sm - like higgs , a very heavy @xmath19 has the @xmath61 and @xmath62 modes as the dominant decays when compared to the @xmath31 one . for the range of masses chosen for the scalars and @xmath45",

    "when @xmath49 , the decay width of the @xmath31 mode decreases by a factor of 4 which leads to a further increase in the br of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 modes .",
    "thus , for a very heavy @xmath19 and larger @xmath20 , the @xmath31 decay mode becomes negligible whenever the remaining scalars are light .",
    "the main production mode for a heavy charged higgs boson is the associated process @xmath74 .",
    "the production cross section is @xmath75 fb ( including charge conjugate cross section ) for @xmath69 gev and @xmath47 in 2hdm - ii at leading order ( lo ) in qcd .",
    "all four decay modes of a heavy charged higgs lead to the @xmath76 final state when all neutral scalars decay to a @xmath77 pair and @xmath78",
    ". our final signal will therefore be @xmath19 production in association with a top - quark followed by the decay of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "hence , the signal contains two @xmath13 bosons and 3 @xmath81-tagged jets .",
    "we will consider the case where one of the @xmath13 bosons decays leptonically while the other decays into a pair of light jets .",
    "therefore , the final signal process contains at least one lepton , at least 2 light jets , at least 3 @xmath81-jets and missing transverse energy .    the only irreducible background to the signal comes from the @xmath82 process with a lo cross section of about 10 pb at the 14 tev lhc .",

    "finally , we have also considered the @xmath91 noise when two light - quark and/or gluon jets are misidentified as two @xmath81-jets .",
    "this background is however very small after all cuts are taken into account , amounting to about 3 to 7 % of the total background .",

    "after the lhc run 1 the bounds have improved but they are @xmath33 dependent and consequently we have now exclusion regions in the charged higgs mass versus @xmath33 plane . although larger values of the masses are now excluded , there is a strong dependence on the yukawa model type .",
    "a dedicated study for charged higgs boson detection in all 2hdm types for a higgs mass below the top - quark mass was performed in  @xcite for the 14 tev lhc .",
    "the main conclusion was that , in the 2hdm - ii , the whole parameter space would be probed for a light charged higgs boson . for other types , probing the large @xmath33 region",
    "has shown to be extremely hard if at all possible .    in this work",
    "we have instead focused on the heavy charged higgs boson in the 2hdm - ii .",
    "in fact , constraints from @xmath159 have raised the lower limit of a 2hdm - ii charged higgs boson mass to about 480 gev .",
    "this raises the question of whether such a heavy charged higgs state can be detected during the current lhc run .",
    "we have chosen a scenario where all possible decay channels are kept open .",
    "since they all contribute to the most relevant signature , which is @xmath82 , we have considered the simultaneous contribution of the different intermediate states @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath160 ( which is however subleading as we have taken @xmath18 to be sm - like ) and @xmath31 . the main production cross section is associated production of a top - quark and a charged higgs boson .",
    "this cross section is larger for either small or large @xmath33 .",
    "with all the theoretical and experimental constraints taken into account , only the low @xmath33 region survives .",
    "therefore we have chosen as our benchmark a value of @xmath33 of order 1 .",
    "the chances of finding a charged higgs boson in fact degrade considerably as @xmath33 increases due to the dependence of the cross section upon it .",
    "we have finally shown that the prospects of detecting a heavy charged higgs state with a mass of 500 gev at the next lhc run are very good already for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath114 for the @xmath61 and @xmath62 modes while for the @xmath31 one a tenfold increase in luminosity would be required @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have also shown that it is possible to distinguish between the different intermediate states provided the scalar masses are sufficiently apart , although very high luminosities are required .",
    "finally one should note that the benchmark proposed gives very similar results for the four yukawa types of the 2hdm . for @xmath33 of order 1",
    "not only the cross sections are the same but also the main decay channels are similar because only @xmath161 depends on the yukawa type and it has the same width in all four models for @xmath33 small .    in short ,",
    "we believe to have set the stage for profitable analyses of the heavy mass region of the @xmath19 state in 2hdms , that might eventually enable its discovery at the lhc , so we advocate atlas and cms to follow the trail we have opened with more realistic experimental analyses",
