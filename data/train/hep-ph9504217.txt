    "several recent papers have been devoted to the study of renormalons in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "these studies exploit and extend the understanding of the relevance of renormalons in field theory , and for operator product expansions ( ope ) in particular , developed in refs .",
    "the present interest was initiated by the observation that the pole mass of a heavy quark , which is an important parameter in the heavy quark expansion , has an intrinsic ambiguity of order @xmath5 due to the presence of infrared ( ir ) renormalons @xcite .",
    "in addition to the infrared renormalons and other non - perturbative effects present in qcd , renormalon ambiguities also arise in the hqet as a result of the expansion in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "a consequence of these additional renormalons is the appearance of non - perturbative effects in the wilson coefficients which relate operators in the effective theory to operators in the full theory ( qcd ) .",
    "this problem is common to all effective theories obtained from an expansion in inverse powers of a large scale .",
    "since these effects are an artefact of the construction of the effective theory and are absent in the original theory , they have to cancel in predictions for physical quantities . in the context of the hqet",
    ", it has been established that the ir renormalon ambiguities in the wilson coefficients are cancelled by ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalon ambiguities in the matrix elements of the operators in the effective theory .",
    "how this cancellation occurs was traced explicitly , to order @xmath0 in the heavy quark expansion , for both inclusive @xcite and exclusive @xcite weak decays of hadrons containing a heavy quark .",
    "a non - perturbative approach for the elimination of the ambiguities in the definition of the pole mass , or more generally in the matrix elements of the operators appearing in the hqet , has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study in more detail the structure of renormalons in the hqet . to be specific , we consider qcd green functions that depend on a large scale @xmath6 ( the heavy quark mass ) and a small scale @xmath7 ( the so - called residual momentum ) .",
    "the purpose of the heavy quark expansion is to disentangle the physics on different length scales by introducing a factorisation scale @xmath8 such that @xmath9 .",
    "contributions from virtual momenta above @xmath8 are calculable in perturbation theory and attributed to wilson coefficients , whereas contributions from virtual momenta below @xmath8 are contained in the matrix elements of the operators in the effective theory .",
    "if this program is performed with a `` hard '' factorisation scale , these matrix elements will , for dimensional reasons , diverge as powers of the uv cut - off @xmath8 .",
    "the appearance of power divergences leads to non - perturbative ambiguities , since factors such as @xmath10 give non - vanishing contributions , which do not appear in perturbation theory  @xcite . for practical reasons ,",
    "however , one usually calculates the wilson coefficients using dimensional regularisation . in this case , by definition , power divergences do not appear , and the `` hard '' factorisation scale @xmath8 is replaced by a `` soft '' renormalisation scale @xmath11 . in such a scheme",
    "it is unavoidable that the wilson coefficients receive contributions from momenta below @xmath11 ( so - called ir renormalons ) , and the matrix elements receive contributions from momenta above @xmath11 ( so - called uv renormalons ) .",
    "these contributions lead to a factorial growth of the coefficients in the perturbative expansion of the wilson coefficients and matrix elements .",
    "the corresponding perturbative series are divergent and not borel summable . since the choice of the renormalisation scale is arbitrary , however , the effects of ir and uv renormalons must cancel each other if one combines the perturbative series for the coefficient functions and matrix elements .",
    "our main point is to demonstrate that the way in which renormalons appear in the hqet ( and , by the same argument , in other effective field theories ) is not universal , but depends on the regularisation scheme used to define the effective theory . to this end , we investigate in detail the relation between uv renormalons and power divergences of hadronic matrix elements of higher - dimensional operators .",
    "we study explicitly the @xmath0 expansion of the heavy quark propagator in different regularisation schemes : dimensional regularisation and three different schemes with a hard uv cut - off ( pauli  villars , momentum flow @xcite and lattice regularisation ) .    in general , from the degree of divergence of the matrix elements of an operator in the hqet one can deduce the position of the uv renormalon singularities in the borel transform of these matrix elements ( see section 2 for a detailed explanation ) . by dimensional arguments we expect that the kinetic energy operator for a heavy quark is quadratically divergent , since it can mix with the identity operator under renormalisation .",
    "indeed , this mixing has been observed in lattice perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "the corresponding renormalon singularity is absent , however .",
    "this `` missing '' singularity is what we have called the `` invisible renormalon '' .",
    "even more surprising is the absence , at one - loop order , of the quadratic divergence in the two other schemes considered in our study , i.e.  the pauli - villars and momentum flow regularisations .",
    "we have been unable to understand whether there is a symmetry , broken by the lattice regularisation , which prevents the appearance of the quadratic divergence in the other cases , or whether this is an artefact of one - loop perturbation theory . in the latter case",
    ", the quadratic divergence would appear at higher orders .",
    "given the relevance of the kinetic energy operator for heavy hadron spectroscopy and inclusive decays @xcite@xcite , an understanding of this puzzle is very important .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we summarise and discuss the main results of our study .",
    "technical details and explicit calculations in different regularisation schemes are presented in sects .",
    "[ sec : exp][sec : cutoff ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] we give our conclusions .",
    "perturbative expansions in qcd are asymptotic and , in general , not borel summable .",
    "when one tries to resum a perturbative series to all orders , one encounters ambiguities , which indicate that perturbation theory is by itself incomplete and must be supplemented by non - perturbative corrections .",
    "a convenient way to analyse these ambiguities is to consider the borel transform @xmath12 of a series @xmath13 with respect to the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "formally , the borel sum of the series can be defined by the integral @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the first coefficient of the @xmath16-function . however , if the borel transform contains singularities on the integration contour , the result of the integration depends on the regularisation prescription , and @xmath13 is not uniquely defined in terms of @xmath17 . in qcd ,",
    "one source of such singularities are the higher - order diagrams in which a virtual gluon line with momentum @xmath7 is dressed by a number of fermion , gluon and ghost loops .",
    "more precisely , one has to consider a gauge - invariant generalisation of such diagrams , which is called a renormalon chain .",
    "effectively , this introduces the running coupling constant @xmath18 at the vertices .",
    "when @xmath18 is expressed in terms of the coupling constant renormalised at a fixed scale @xmath11 , the appearance of powers of large logarithms leads to a factorial divergence in the expansion coefficients of the perturbative series . associated with this",
    "are renormalon singularities in the borel transform @xmath17 .",
    "depending on whether these singularities are related to the region of large or small virtual momenta , they are referred to as uv or ir renormalons @xcite@xcite .",
    "although the resummation of renormalon chains corresponds to only a partial resummation of the perturbative series , it elucidates many non - perturbative effects and thus provides an interesting , non - trivial approximation . if one accepts this so - called `` bubble approximation '' , the renormalon singularities occur as poles on the real axis in the borel plane .",
    "let us denote the position of the nearest pole on the positive @xmath19-axis by @xmath20 , i.e.@xmath21 .",
    "then a measure of the ambiguity in the borel integral ( [ btinv ] ) is given by @xmath22 in the last step we have used the one - loop expression for the running coupling constant .    as mentioned above , in dimensional regularisation power divergences",
    "are hidden because of the absence of an intrinsic mass scale in the computation .",
    "however , perturbation theory `` knows '' about these divergences in the form of renormalon singularities in the borel plane .",
    "in fact , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the structure of the uv renormalon poles in dimensional regularisation and the power divergences in regularisation schemes with a hard cut - off .",
    "for instance , if a quantity is linearly divergent in one - loop perturbation theory , then its borel transform in the bubble approximation is logarithmically divergent at @xmath23 , corresponding to a pole singularity at this point .",
    "a similar argument is expected to hold for quadratic or higher - order power divergences .",
    "to illustrate this point we present results for the renormalised inverse heavy quark propagator @xmath24 in the hqet . here",
    "@xmath25 is the residual momentum , which stays finite in the limit @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is a four - velocity vector ( @xmath28 ) , which is usually identified with the velocity of the hadron containing the heavy quark . in dimensional regularisation , renormalon effects appear as singularities in the borel transform @xmath29 . in the bubble approximation one",
    "@xcite @xmath30 \\bigg\\}\\ ] ] in the landau gauge .",
    "the scheme - dependent function @xmath31 , which for renormalisation schemes with analytic counterterms ( such as ms - like schemes ) is entire in the complex @xmath19-plane , is irrelevant for our purposes . expanding the above expression around @xmath32 and inserting the result into the borel integral ( [ btinv ] )",
    ", one finds @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a colour factor .",
    "the @xmath35-functions in the numerator of ( [ seff ] ) define the positions of the renormalon singularities .",
    "the uv renormalons are given by the poles of @xmath36 and are thus located at @xmath37 is removed by renormalisation , however .",
    "] they are due to the contributions of virtual momenta above @xmath11 in loop integrals .",
    "note that there appear also ir renormalons ( at @xmath38 ) , which are due to the contributions of virtual momenta below the soft scale @xmath7 . since , by construction , the effective theory and the full theory describe the same dynamics in the ir region",
    ", these renormalons reflect truly non - perturbative effects of qcd and are thus independent of the uv regularisation scheme .",
    "they are not related to the construction of the hqet and are therefore not the topic of our discussion .",
    "the uv renormalon at @xmath23 is the nearest singularity on the integration contour of the borel integral in ( [ btinv ] ) .",
    "an expansion of the borel transform around this point leads to @xmath39 the linear dependence on @xmath11 reflects the linear uv divergence of the inverse propagator in the effective theory , which in dimensional regularisation is not seen in perturbation theory . using the above result together with ( [ deltas ] ) , we find that the renormalon ambiguity in the definition of the inverse propagator is of order @xmath5 .",
    "let us now compare these results to the one - loop calculation of the inverse propagator performed with a hard pauli ",
    "villars cut - off @xmath8 . in this case one finds ( for details see sect .",
    "[ sec : cutoff ] ) @xmath40 we have given the result for an arbitrary covariant gauge .",
    "the landau gauge corresponds to @xmath41 , whereas the feynman gauge corresponds to @xmath42 .",
    "note that the coefficient of the logarithmic term is the same in ( [ sdr ] ) and ( [ spv ] ) .",
    "the linearly uv divergent term in ( [ spv ] ) is in correspondence with the term proportional to @xmath11 in ( [ suresid ] ) , which leads to a renormalon ambiguity of order @xmath5 . note that in the case of the cut - off regularisation the power divergence leads to an ambiguity of the same order , as explained above [ see ( [ eq : arg ] ) ] .",
    "this correspondence between uv renormalons and power divergences works in several cases .",
    "however , an apparent exception is provided by the quark matrix element of the kinetic energy operator @xmath43 , which appears at order @xmath0 in the expansion of the inverse propagator .",
    "denotes the velocity - dependent heavy quark field in the hqet , and @xmath44 contains the `` spatial '' components of the covariant derivative . for details",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . ]",
    "this dimension - five operator has the same quantum numbers as the lower - dimensional operators @xmath45 ( dimension - three ) and @xmath46 ( dimension - four ) .",
    "hence , in a generic regularisation scheme with a dimensionful regulator , one expects a mixing with these operators , leading to quadratic and linear uv divergences .",
    "indeed , these divergences appear in the lattice formulation of the hqet , where , at one - loop order , one finds @xcite @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are dimensionless constants , and the uv cut - off is provided by the inverse lattice spacing , @xmath50 .",
    "the puzzle that we wish to point out is that the quadratic divergence is _ not _ seen in some other cut - off regularisation schemes ( such as pauli ",
    "villars ) .",
    "moreover , in the bubble approximation we do not find an uv renormalon pole corresponding to the quadratic divergence .",
    "the nearest uv singularity in the borel transform of @xmath51 is located at @xmath52 , and an expansion around this point gives @xmath53 this behaviour corresponds to the linearly divergent term in ( [ kinlat ] ) .",
    "however , we do not find a term of the form @xmath54 , which would correspond to the quadratic divergence .",
    "we shall refer to this `` missing '' renormalon pole at @xmath55 as the _",
    "invisible renormalon_.    there are several possible explanations for this puzzle .",
    "the general argument given above is that there is a relation between the degree of divergence of the matrix elements of higher - dimensional operators and the position of the singularities in their borel transform in dimensional regularisation .",
    "the coefficients of the divergent terms and of the renormalon singularities , however , are not universal and may be zero in some regularisation schemes . indeed , there is no reason why renormalon singularities or power divergences should be the same for all versions of the theory , since the ambiguities related to these renormalons ( or powers divergences ) are spurious and cancel in the predictions for physical quantities .",
    "it is therefore conceivable to find some regularisation schemes in which at one - loop order the coefficient of the quadratic divergence of the kinetic operator happens to be zero .",
    "mixes with @xmath56 , which itself mixes with @xmath57 .",
    "] however , it is surprising to us that we could find only a single regularisation scheme in which this coefficient _ does not vanish_. moreover , even if one accepts this point of view one still has to explain the absence of a renormalon pole at @xmath55 in the borel transform ( [ kinbor ] ) .",
    "a possibility would be that such a singularity appears only when one goes beyond the bubble approximation .    on the other hand",
    ", one may wonder whether the appearance of a quadratic divergence in the lattice regularisation scheme is due to the breaking of some symmetry preserved in other regularisation schemes . in this case",
    "the invisible renormalon would be nothing more than a lattice artefact .",
    "examples of such broken symmetries are lorentz symmetry and , as a consequence , the so - called reparametrisation invariance of the hqet @xcite .",
    "we note that the breaking of reparametrisation invariance is responsible for the fact that the renormalisation constants of the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 differ by a finite term of order @xmath60 in the lattice version of the hqet @xcite , whereas they are the same in the continuum version of the theory @xcite",
    ". however , reparametrisation invariance does not forbid the mixing between the operators @xmath59 and @xmath45 , which is responsible for the quadratic divergence .",
    "this concludes our main discussion . in the following sections we present the details of the calculations , whose results",
    "were referred to above .",

    "we define @xmath158 using again the relation between the distribution functions and the borel transforms given in ( [ sfuns ] ) , we obtain @xmath159 for large values of @xmath153 , the first function falls off proportional to @xmath160 , so that the corresponding integral is logarithmically uv divergent . after a straightforward calculation we find for the renormalisation factors defined in ( [ eq : pv1 ] ) @xmath161 once again we find that the quadratic divergence , which is expected on dimensional grounds , is absent . in the momentum flow regularisation scheme , the absence of the quadratic divergence is directly linked to the absence of an uv renormalon pole at @xmath55 in the borel transform @xmath162 in ( [ sfuns ] ) , since the borel transform determines the distribution function through an integral relation of the type ( [ wsrela ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to note the close similarity of the above results with ( [ zresults ] ) . in both regularisation schemes and in an arbitrary covariant gauge , the results for the renormalisation factors can be written in the form @xmath163 and @xmath164 where @xmath165 in pauli ",

    "we discuss the one - loop corrections to the propagator and to the kinetic energy operator in the lattice regularisation .",
    "all results reported in this section have been obtained in the static theory ( @xmath169 ) in euclidean space .    among the possible lattice formulations of the hqet we choose the simplest one ,",

    "the quantities @xmath49 and @xmath180 are given by @xmath181 with @xmath182 the constant @xmath180 is logarithmically divergent .",
    "it contributes to the wave - function renormalisation and hence to the renormalisation of any local operator containing the heavy quark field .",

    "the corrections to the kinetic energy operator can be computed from @xmath184 for the operator @xmath185 we take @xmath186 where @xmath187 denotes the unit vector in the @xmath188-direction . at the tree level one",

    "moreover , since reparametrisation invariance is broken on the lattice , the renormalisation of the kinetic energy operator differs from the wave function renormalisation by a factor @xmath195 .",
    "in the hqet the coefficients of higher - order terms in the expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass are proportional to matrix elements of higher - dimensional operators . in general",
    "these matrix elements diverge in perturbation theory as powers of the uv cut - off , and using dimensional regularisation their perturbation series are not borel summable due to the presence of uv renormalon singularities in the borel plane .",
    "the ambiguities due to the presence of these renormalons are cancelled by those due to ir renormalons in the wilson coefficient functions of lower - dimensional operators .    in this paper",
    "we have investigated in some detail the relation between power divergences and renormalons .",
    "this correspondence , which is based on dimensional arguments , appears to fail in one important case , that of the kinetic energy operator . in a lattice regularisation",
    "@xmath59 mixes with @xmath57 with a quadratically divergent coefficient , as expected from the naive degree of divergence of the corresponding feynman diagrams .",
    "however , at least to one - loop order in perturbation theory , this quadratic divergence is absent when using the pauli - villars and momentum flow regularisations .",
    "moreover , the corresponding uv renormalon is absent using dimensional regularisation .",
    "the absence of the corresponding ir renormalon in the pole mass had already been noted in ref .",
    "these results suggest that there may be some symmetry , which prevents @xmath59 from mixing with @xmath45 , and that this symmetry is broken with the lattice regularisation .",
    "an obvious candidate for such a symmetry is lorentz ( or euclidean ) invariance , which takes the form of reparametrisation invariance in the effective theory @xcite . this symmetry does not seem to forbid such a mixing , however .",
    "given the relevance of the kinetic energy operator to studies of the spectroscopy and inclusive decays of heavy hadrons @xcite@xcite , it is important to understand whether the absence of the power divergences and the corresponding renormalon is an accident of one - loop perturbation theory and the bubble approximation , or whether it is a consequence of a more general principle .",
