    "the importance of effective charge in colloidal or polyelectrolyte suspensions has been recognized for some time  @xcite . the electric potential far from a colloid immersed in an electrolyte defining the inverse screening length @xmath0 takes the same form as the solution of the linearized debye  hckel equation say @xmath1 for a charged sphere of radius @xmath2 but with a prefactor @xmath3 which is different from the bare charge @xmath4 of the colloid . in the previous expression",
    ", @xmath5 is the distance from the center of the sphere of interest , and @xmath6 is the bjerrum length , defined from the elementary charge @xmath7 and the permittivity @xmath8 of the solvent ( the molecular structure of which is neglected ) .",
    "an interesting feature that occurs in the framework of ( non - linear ) poisson  boltzmann theory @xcite is that for highly charged colloids , the effective charge @xmath3 saturates to a finite value @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this saturation value is an upper bound for effective charges found within more refined approaches that incorporate the micro - ionic correlations neglected in poisson - boltzmann theory @xcite . we will come back to the validity of the latter approach in the concluding section .    since poisson ",
    "boltzmann is a mean field theory , there has been several proposals to go beyond that approximation and try to include effects like micro - ions excluded volume  @xcite or electrostatic correlations between micro - ions  @xcite .",
    "a natural question arises .",
    "under which conditions a given theory will account for the saturation phenomenon ?",
    "we will not give here a definite answer to this question in its full generality .",
    "however we will consider the special case of local theories theories which provide a local relationship between the density of micro - ions and the electric potential and give a necessary and sufficient condition under which the electrostatic potential of an infinite charged plane immersed in an electrolyte will saturate when the bare surface charge density of the plane diverges .",
    "as explained below , the phenomenon of potential saturation is slightly more general than that of effective charge saturation : effective charge saturation implies potential saturation , whereas potential saturation does not necessarily allows to define an effective charge .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec : framework ] the framework and the class of theories that will be considered . in sec .",

    "furthermore the electric potential satisfies the boundary conditions    [ eq : bc - psi ] @xmath21    suppose now that an approximate local theory is provided .",

    "indeed , ( [ eq : hypothese - stabilite ] ) implies that @xmath47 , therefore @xmath48 is a decreasing function and never vanishes for @xmath18 finite .",

    "that can be inverted : @xmath60 exists and it is also an increasing function . as a consequence",

    "the constant of integration @xmath52 is related to the surface charge density @xmath11 of the plane and is determined by the boundary condition  ( [ eq : bc - psi - x=0 ] ) .",
    "an interesting feature is that this constant of integration comes as an additive offset for the position @xmath18 .",
    "a change in @xmath11 ( therefore in the constant of integration @xmath52 ) results in a translation of the curve @xmath17@xmath18 along the @xmath18-axis .",

    "again , the stability condition  ( [ eq : hypothese - stabilite ] ) ensures that there is a unique solution for @xmath52 since @xmath43 is monotonous .",
    "we will say that there is a saturation of the electrostatic potential if it is possible to have @xmath64 with a finite solution for @xmath17 for all @xmath65 .",

    "we emphasize that the notion of potential saturation is more general than that of effective charge saturation : to define an effective charge , one needs to show that the ionic profiles behave far from the wall as they would within a _ linear _ theory such as debye  hckel . the effective charge is then defined from the far field created by the charged object , as that required within a linear theory to obtain the same potential at large distances .",
    "our analysis does not require such a limitation .",
    "however , in the case where the local theory is formulated in the framework of the dft we show in appendix  [ sec : appendix - b ] that , far from the charged wall , the theory reproduces the far field of the linear debye ",

    "the function @xmath55 is strictly increasing in the interval @xmath77 .",
