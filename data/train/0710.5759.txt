    "star - to - star variations of the strength of the 3883   cn band are nearly universal in moderate - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 ) globular clusters of the milky way , but unusual in low - metallicity globular clusters ( [ fe / h ] @xmath2 ) ( see gratton , sneden & carretta 2004 for a thorough review ) .",
    "typically a cn bandstrength is measured as a magnitude difference between the flux within the 3883   cn band and the flux in a nearby comparison band chosen to be free of cn absorption . the index @xmath3 introduced by norris et al .",
    "( 1981 ) is one such measure of cn band strength .",
    "not only does @xmath3 vary from star to star within individual globular clusters , its distribution is often bimodal in moderate - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 ) clusters .",
    "it is often anticorrelated with the strength of ch absorption in the g band at 4300   among giants of similar absolute magnitude .",
    "this anticorrelation indicates that cn - strong stars are depleted in carbon . in order to have strong cn bands with low [ c / fe ] abundances ,",
    "the cn - strong stars must also be enhanced in nitrogen .",
    "this abundance pattern has directed investigations into the origin of the bimodality toward stellar sources , where hydrogen shell burning can produce abundance enhancements and depletions such as those observed in globular clusters in c and n ( and also o , na , mg , and al ) . meanwhile ,",
    "few cn - strong giants are known in the halo field ( see , e.g. , pilachowski et al . 1996 ; shetrone et al .",
    "1999 ) , indicating that the enrichment process responsible for cn bimodality only operated in cluster ( or proto - cluster ) environments .",
    "this paper considers whether the apparent lack of cn bimodality in low - metallicity globular clusters is a true lack of abundance variation or simply an effect of low overall metal abundance .",
    "previous investigations into the behavior of cn abundance at low metallicity have been inconclusive as to whether large variations in bandstrength can be present .",

    "( 1982 ) found variations of [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] but no strong 3883   cn bands among the red giant stars of m92 ( [ fe / h]@xmath5 ) .",
    "briley et al . ( 1994 ) showed that the carbon and nitrogen abundances measured within m92 would result in a bimodal distribution of @xmath3 if the overall metallicity were scaled up to [ fe / h]@xmath6 dex .",
    "smith & norris ( 1982 ) and briley et al .",
    "( 1993 ) both studied m55 ( [ fe / h]@xmath7 , harris 1996 ) , and found that it is quite homogeneous in cn bandstrength .",
    "that lack of cn - strong stars could be the result of low overall metallicity inhibiting the formation of cn molecules , low [ c / fe ] among the brighter red giants , or a sign that whatever enrichment process caused cn variations in moderate - metallicity globular clusters did not operate at lower metallicities .",
    "a study of additional globular clusters with metallicities similar to m55 could help decide between these alternatives .",
    "we chose m53 as the subject of this study because it is similar in metallicity to m55 ( based on our isochrone fits discussed below ) , and will hopefully provide insight into whether low - metallicity globular clusters contain cn - enhanced stars . while our study does not comment directly on the process that causes abundance inhomogeneities in globular clusters , we note here that a lack of abundance variation in the lowest - metallicity clusters would provide a constraint on all hypotheses about that process .    to understand the cn and ch index behavior , we compare spectroscopy of the 3883   cn band for red giants in m53 to the norris et al .",
    "( 1981 ) study of ngc 6752 , a moderate - metallicity globular cluster ( [ fe / h]@xmath8 ) that shows clear cn bimodality .",
    "we also convert ch bandstrengths into [ c / fe ] abundances using synthetic spectra and look at the relations between carbon abundance and cn bandstrengths . an intrinsic spread is found in cn bandstrength , but it is smaller than the range observed in ngc 6752 .",
    "this result is interesting in the light of work by dantona et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who use stellar evolution models to draw connections between helium abundance and horizontal branch morphology .",
    "they find that globular clusters with solar helium abundances have short , red horizontal branches , while extended blue horizontal branches result from the smaller core mass of helium - enhanced stars . in their model ,",
    "the helium enrichment comes from agb feedback , implying that globular clusters with red horizontal branches , like m53 , should exhibit only minor cno - product enrichment .",

    "the spectroscopic data were reduced using the xidl suite of idl programs developed by jason prochaska and gabriel prochter .",
    "the kast - specific programs were used to identify observation types , create a nightly hehgcd composite arc spectrum and dome flat - field image , do flat - field corrections , trace , extract and wavelength - calibrate one - dimensional spectra , and combine multiple spectra of the same object .",
    "the xidl routines did not include an option for correcting spectra for atmospheric extinction ; since some of our spectra were taken at an airmass of 2 , a script was written to perform those corrections prior to the measurement of indices from the data .",
    "the correction was based on the mean extinction curve given on the lick observatory web site .",
    "we transformed the bandstrength indices onto a standard system defined by indices derived from hst spectra of flux standard stars taken from the stsci calspec database described by bohlin ( 1996 ) .",
    "these  standard \" index values were compared to indices measured from the extinction - corrected ( but unfluxed ) kast spectra that were obtained on each night of one or more of the calspec flux standards .",

    "these differences were applied as offsets to correct the kast indices from the m53 spectra onto a standard system .",
    "one - sigma errors in the index measurements were estimated by measuring @xmath3 and @xmath13 from individual spectra of stars observed more than once .",

    "ngc 6752 has a metallicity of @xmath25 ( harris 1996 ) , and its @xmath3 distribution is typical of moderate - metallicity globular clusters , with two distinct sequences separated by a gap . the data for ngc 6752 come from norris et al . ( 1981 ) .",
    "the increase in bandstrength as temperature decreases is partly caused by more abundant molecule formation at lower temperature , but is made steeper by the changing shape of the stellar continuum .",
    "the m53 data include the error bars calculated in the previous paragraph , and it is clear that the range in @xmath3 at a given @xmath26 is significant relative to @xmath27 , indicating that the width of the cn variation is intrinsic to the stars rather than a result of measurement errors .",
    "we identify two groups of m53 red giants in figure 3 on the basis of their @xmath3 indices : a cn - weak group ( plotted as open circles ) and a cn - enhanced group ( filled circles ) .",
    "conversion from the ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) plane to the ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) plane was accomplished by comparing the m53 fiducial sequence from rey et al .",

    "the red sideband was necessarily narrow , as there is very little [ c / fe]-independent spectrum redward of 4320  .",
    "the blue sideband is farther from the science band than we would prefer , but there are complex cn molecular features near 4200  .",
    "positioning of the blue sideband ( 4050   to 4100   ) is a compromise between band width , location , and [ c / fe ] dependence .",
    "figure 5 shows the dependence of the 3883   cn band on nitrogen abundance at @xmath43 ( with a fixed [ c / fe ] ) , and the wavelength bands for the @xmath3 index are marked with vertical lines .",
    "only the red edge of the comparison band is shown as a dotted line because its blue edge coincides with the red limit of the science band .",
    "for comparison , the spectrum of m53 g is also plotted , vertically offset from the three synthetic spectra .",
    "the red sideband for @xmath3 is far easier to place than either of the sidebands for @xmath13 , as there is a wide region redward of the 3883   bandhead that is insensitive to [ n / fe ] .",
    "the strong k line is avoided .",
    "it is impractical to place a comparison sideband to the blue of the 3883   cn feature , since the intrinsic flux of a red giant drops precipitously into the uv .",
    "there is also a forest of metal absorption lines and hydrogen balmer lines in the uv , and furthermore it is problematic to find a wide spectral region to the blue that is reasonably independent of [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] .",
    "the single sideband is partially responsible for the strong temperature trend in @xmath3 , and can also cause significant instrument - to - instrument offsets . for these reasons",
    "norris et al .",

    "we are interested in comparing the cn and ch index behavior in m53 to that in globular clusters with more moderate metallicity , and use two separate methods for making this comparison . in an index analysis , we compare the behavior of the @xmath3 and @xmath13 indices in m53 with the variations observed in ngc 6752 , a typical example of a cn - bimodal globular cluster . in an abundance analysis ,",
    "we determine [ c / fe ] abundances for individual m53 red giants by comparing data to isoabundance loci in the @xmath13 versus @xmath26 plane .",
    "ngc 6752 is an excellent example of bimodal cn bandstrength and anticorrelated [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] behavior .",
    "figure 6 shows a generalized histogram of @xmath44 for m53 red giants ( solid line ) with the analogous ngc 6752 data from norris et al .",
    "( 1981 ) overplotted as a dotted line .",
    "the solid histogram is a sum of gaussian curves with a @xmath46 of 0.02 , the standard error on @xmath3 for the kast m53 spectra , while the gaussian @xmath46 used by norris et al .",
    "( 1981 ) is 0.045 .",
    "the distribution of cn bandstrength in m53 is clearly not well - described by a single symmetric gaussian curve ; indeed , a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test comparing @xmath44 for stars identified as cn - weak and cn - enhanced in figure 3 returns a probability of @xmath47 that the two groups were drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "however , there is a clear difference between the m53 cn distribution and that of ngc 6752 : the latter has a large separation between two clearly distinct cn groups , and also has a more well - populated cn - strong group than the former .",

    "first , at a fixed [ c / fe ] , the model curves show a clear temperature effect on @xmath13 for stars brighter than @xmath55 ( @xmath56 k ) .",
    "second , the decline in @xmath13 with rising luminosity in the data is steeper than the temperature effect alone , and this implies that there is a decline in [ c / fe ] with decreasing @xmath26 among the red giants in m53 .",
    "figure 8 shows @xmath44 versus @xmath13 for our m53 data .",
    "the left plot shows the full data set , and the right panel shows only the stars fainter than @xmath55 .",
    "there is no clear anticorrelation in the left panel , whereas the right panel shows that among stars with @xmath48 those with enhanced cn bands have relatively low @xmath13 indices , as noted also from figure 7 .",
    "the lack of a more prominent anticorrelation between cn and ch in the full data set may be partly due to a reduced sensitivity of the index @xmath3 to nitrogen abundance at the low metallicity of m53 .",
    "this point is illustrated by figure 9 , which shows the @xmath3 measurements for m53 versus @xmath26 , with model isoabundance curves for [ c / fe]@xmath57 dex and [ n / fe ] ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath41 dex overplotted . since ( as we show below ) not all of the stars have [ c / fe]@xmath57 dex , the distribution of data points in this plot is not necessarily indicative of true nitrogen abundance . at the location of our faintest star in the ( @xmath58 ) plane , changing [ n / fe ] by 0.1 dex changes @xmath3 by 0.02 . since a factor of two change in nitrogen abundance only produces a few - sigma change in @xmath3 , its usefulness as an indicator of [ n / fe ] is limited at the metallicity of m53 .",
    "since @xmath3 has a diminished sensitivity to [ n / fe ] at the metallicity of m53 , we do not attempt to use it to measure [ n / fe ] for individual stars . however , we can comment on the range of [ n / fe ] in our sample , and compare it to the range reported by norris et al .",

    "the carbon depletion rate in the full m53 sample is 0.22 dex per v magnitude , which is similar to the rate measured in red giants in the halo field by smith & martell ( 2003 )",
    ". studies of red giants in other globular clusters also show abundance trends that indicate ongoing deep mixing ( see , e.g. , carbon et al .",
    "1982 and trefzger et al .",
    "the theoretical study of denissenkov & vandenberg ( 2003 ) , which models deep mixing as a diffusive process , finds that deep mixing rates among low - mass red giants ought to be fairly independent of mass and metallicity , which may explain why abundance trends are so similar among so many different groups of red giants .",
    "however , there is the possibility that the measured carbon abundances are affected by a systematic error resulting from initial model assumptions .",
    "specifically , when the synthetic spectra were created , it was assumed that all stars had the same oxygen abundance regardless of luminosity . by not allowing for a decline in [ o / fe ] with rising luminosity",
    ", our models pertain to a case in which deep mixing has not affected oxygen .",
    "free oxygen in cool stellar atmospheres ( @xmath56 k ) participates in molecular equilibrium by forming co , which consumes carbon atoms that could otherwise form ch molecules . with a fixed carbon abundance , therefore , an oxygen - enhanced star will have weaker ch bands than an oxygen - depleted star .",
    "if [ o / fe ] starts at a value of + 0.2 dex , but oxygen is depleted as stars evolve along the giant branch , due to some mixing process that our models do not take into account , then too large a carbon abundance will be inferred for the most evolved stars , since we will have assumed too large an oxygen abundance for them .",
    "this will act to make the decline in figure 11 artificially shallow , and the true decrease in [ c / fe ] with brightening @xmath26 would be steeper than indicated .",
    "briley et al . (",
    "1990 ) consider the effect of varying [ o / fe ] from @xmath65 to @xmath66 dex on their [ c / fe ] measurements for the low - metallicity cluster m55 .",
    "their table 7 shows that [ c / fe ] determined from ch bandstrength can change by as much as 0.5 dex for a 1.0 dex change in assumed [ o / fe ] , with the effect being largest in the coolest stars .",
    "smith & briley ( 2006 ) collected abundance data from the literature for the moderate - metallicity globular cluster m13 .",
    "the data show a considerable spread in [ o / fe ] at a given @xmath26 , and a decline of roughly 1 dex in the minimum [ o / fe ] over the @xmath26 range covered in our m53 sample .",
    "if oxygen behaves in an analogous way in m53 , our use of constant-[o / fe ] models would cause systematic errors in the [ c / fe ] difference inferred between the faintest stars in our sample and those brighter giants that have been diminished in oxygen . however , as noted in the previous paragraph , such an effect would not lead us to infer a spurious decline in carbon abundance along the red giant branch , but would act in the opposite sense to partially mask any carbon decrease that is present .",
    "thus , the evidence of figure 11 that evolutionary changes do occur in the surface carbon abundances of the m53 red giants would remain valid , although the size of the effect may be underestimated in the present work .",
    "the hottest stars in our m53 sample should be the least affected by [ o / fe ] variations because they are unlikely to have significant abundances of co in their atmospheres .",
    "suntzeff ( 1981 ) showed that relatively little co forms above 4500 k in red giant photospheres at the metallicity of m13 . according to the victoria isochrone",
    "we have adopted for m53 , a temperature of 4500 k corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath55 .",
    "it is among stars fainter than this that the evidence for a cn - ch band anticorrelation in figure 8 is greatest .",
    "if the atmospheres of cn - enhanced stars have been subjected to greater cno - processing than those of the cn - weak stars , they will have lower [ o / fe ] and [ c / fe ] abundances but higher [ n / fe ] than cn - weak stars .",
    "this will produce a cn - ch band anticorrelation in stars hot enough to have little or no co molecular formation in the atmosphere .",
    "however , in cooler cn - enhanced giants there would be less co formation than in the cn - weak giants , which may partially counteract a cn - ch anticorrelation by leaving relatively more carbon available for ch formation .",
    "figure 8 , seen in this light , shows a cn - ch anticorrelation in the hotter stars that may be erased as co formation sets in more strongly in the cn - weak stars .",
    "the generalized histogram of @xmath44 shows that m53 has a distribution of cn bandstrength whose width is greater than our 3-@xmath46 errors .",
    "we infer that m53 has a population of cn - enhanced giants , and not just cn - weak stars .",
    "however , there are two physical factors that erode the appearance of cn bimodality at low metallicity : first , in a cluster with a low [ fe / h ] , the low carbon and nitrogen abundances can sustain only limited molecular cn formation .",
    "second , deep mixing scenarios predict that mixing efficiency should be high at low metallicity ( e.g. , sweigart & mengel 1979 ; charbonnel 1995 ) , meaning that evolved stars in a low - metallicity cluster like m53 will be depleted in carbon and enhanced in nitrogen from the dredge - up of c@xmath67n and possibly o@xmath67n - processed material .",
    "if the mixing continues to the point where carbon is less abundant than nitrogen , the abundance of cn molecules can decline with rising luminosity ( see , e.g. , the discussion of extremely c - depleted stars in cohen et al .",
    "2002 and langer et al .",
    "1985 ) .",
    "the relatively small range in carbon and nitrogen abundance variation observed in m53 may also be an indication that the polluting material was not processed through the full cno cycle .",
    "if this is the case , then m53 should not show an o - na anticorrelation , because neither the o@xmath67n processing nor the nena - cycle processing that occurs at the same temperature will have taken place .",
    "the data collected for this study do not allow for an investigation into this question , but a followup study at higher resolution could be quite interesting .",
    "o - na anticorrelations have been found in red giants in every globular cluster where they have been sought , meaning that their absence in m53 would be notable .    in summary , we find a progressive decrease in [ c / fe ] with brightening @xmath26 among red giants in m53 , indicating that deep mixing is occurring .",
    "the [ c / fe ] and @xmath3 measurements further reveal that some stars have carbon depletions and nitrogen enhancements ( relative to the cluster cn - weak stars ) as large as those observed in the cn - strong giants of the classically cn - bimodal globular cluster ngc 6752 ( although we do not see a strongly bimodal cn distribution in m53 ) , indicating that whatever process is responsible for primordial abundance variations in ngc 6752 ( as described in caretta et al .",
    "2005 and suntzeff & smith 1991 ) is also operating at the lower metallicity of m53 ( [ fe / h]@xmath68 ) . we conclude that the rarity of cn - strong stars in other clusters with [ fe / h ] @xmath69 or lower , such as m55 , is more likely an effect of the overall low metallicity causing diminished cn molecule formation and the reduced sensitivity of the index @xmath3 at low metallicity , and is not due to some unexplained lack of abundance inhomogeneity",
    ". a direct test of this hypothesis would be to obtain spectroscopy of the @xmath703360 nh band for red giants in m53 and m55 . in the case of m92 , which is of even lower metallicity",
    ", it would seem that the formation of cn - strong giants is inhibited by the low overall metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath71 even though large [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] differences , as well as large [ n / fe ] enhancements , were found among the red giants by carbon et al .",
