    "low scale inflation _ is _ desirable in order to identify the inflaton field with one of the mssm flat directions @xcite or with one of the fields appearing in the susy breaking sector , giving the inflaton a much deeper particle physics root .",
    "in contrast low scale inflation _ is not _",
    "desirable because it makes very difficult the generation of the adiabatic perturbations by the inflaton , leading to multiple fine - tuning and model - building problems , unless the curvaton mechanism is invoked @xcite . with the aim of generating the curvature perturbation that gives origin to the large - scale structure in the observable universe",
    ", the curvaton mechanism has appeared as a nice and plausible option and a lot of research has been devoted to its study .",
    "making the curvaton mechanism viable in a low energy inflationary framework would be the ideal situation but , unfortunately , the simplest curvaton model has shown to be incompatible with low enough values for the hubble parameter during inflation @xcite .",
    "some general proposals to make the curvaton paradigm accommodate low scale inflation have recently appeared and specific models have also been studied @xcite . in a recent proposal @xcite , a thermal inflation epoch",
    "was attached to the general curvaton mechanism making the curvaton field gain a huge increment in the mass at the end of the thermal inflationary period , triggering this way a period of curvaton oscillations , and lowering the main inflationary scale to satisfactory levels . however , the parameters of the model required for this effect to take place showed to be extremely small to affect the reliability of the model .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to study the same mechanism but in the case where the increment in the mass is so huge that the decay rate becomes bigger than the hubble parameter and the curvaton decays immediately .",
    "the results are very positive , offering a more natural parameter space .",
    "thermal inflation was introduced as a very nice mechanism to get rid of some unwanted relics that the main inflationary epoch is not able to dilute , without affecting the density perturbations generated during ordinary inflation .",
    "as its name suggests , thermal inflation relies on the finite - temperature effects on the  flaton \" scalar potential .",
    "a flaton field @xmath5 could be defined as a field with mass @xmath6 and vacuum expectation value @xmath7 @xcite ; and the possible candidates within particle physics would be one of the many expected gauge singlets in string theory @xcite , the gut higgs ( which is a scalar field charged under the gut gauge symmetry but neutral under the standard model one ) with and @xmath8 gev @xcite , or the peccei - quinn field with ( presumably ) @xmath9 ev and @xmath10 gev @xcite . after the period of reheating following the main inflationary epoch , the thermal background modifies the flaton potential @xmath11 trapping the flaton field at the origin and preventing it to roll - down towards @xmath12 @xcite . at this stage the total energy density @xmath13 and pressure @xmath14 are @xmath15 making the condition for thermal inflation , @xmath16 , valid when the thermal energy density @xmath17 falls below the height of the potential @xmath18 , which corresponds to a temperature of roughly @xmath19 .",
    "thermal inflation ends when the finite temperature becomes ineffective at a temperature of order @xmath6 , so the number of e - folds this inflationary period lasts is    @xmath20    here we have used the fact that , in a flaton potential of the form @xmath21 where the @xmath22th term dominates : @xmath23^{-1 } \\tilde{m}_\\chi^2 \\ , , \\\\",
    "v_0 & = & [ 2(n+2)]^{-1 } \\tilde{m}_\\chi^2 m^2 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 being the reduced planck mass .",
    "note that the @xmath25 contribution to the effective mass of the flaton field stands for the effect of the thermal background , which changes the slope of the potential in the @xmath5 direction and traps the flaton field at the origin of the potential @xcite .",
    "it is also worthwhile to mention that the potential is stabilized by non - renormalisable terms , with dimensionless couplings @xmath26 to make the theory valid up to the planck scale .",
    "otherwise , the vacuum expectation value @xmath12 would not be much bigger than @xmath27 , spoiling the suppression of the unwanted relics .    before embedding the thermal inflation epoch and the curvaton mechanism into a single model ,",
    "we want to clarify some issues about the nature of the interactions that produce the thermal background .",
    "if the flaton is a gut higgs , it is coupled with those fields charged under the gut gauge symmetry , in particular with those the inflaton field decays into .",
    "that collection of particles makes the thermal background , and its interaction with the flaton field produces the thermal correction . if the flaton field is a gauge singlet it still can be coupled , via yukawa coupling terms , with some other fields , possibly in a hidden sector , that the inflaton field decays into .",
    "again , a thermal correction is generated .",
    "the actual interactions and decay rate are not important as the main objective of this paper is to obtain some particle physics model - independent information about the possibility of reconcile low scale inflation with the curvaton mechanism , in a scenario that involves a second period of inflation ( thermal inflation ) , without going into the details of the identification of all the relevant fields ( inflaton , flaton , and curvaton ) in the framework of a particle physics model ( gut theories , mssm , etc . ) , which would make the results highly particle physics model - dependent .",
    "the flaton could be either a gauge singlet or the gut higgs . in the former case the flaton",
    "can be coupled with some other fields that the inflaton field decays into , via yukawa coupling terms , and the specific interactions would be known once we choose what of the many gauge singlets expected in string theory is the flaton . in the latter case the interactions in the gut models are already known .",
    "the specific interactions are important of course , but there are so many possibilities that the general result would be hidden behind the characteristics associated to any definite particle physics model .",
    "having discussed the nature of the flaton interactions , and guided by the result in ref . , we proceed to implement a second inflationary stage into the curvaton scenario in order to lower the main inflationary energy scale @xcite . if this second epoch of inflation is the thermal inflation one devised in refs .",
    "we would be solving not only the issue of the ordinary inflation energy scale but also the moduli problem present in the standard cosmology .",
    "in the curvaton model supplemented by a thermal inflation epoch two fields @xmath5 and @xmath28 , which we identify as the flaton and the curvaton fields respectively , are embedded into the radiation background left by the inflaton decay .",
    "it is assumed that the curvaton field could be a gauge singlet @xcite or a mssm flat direction @xcite , and has just a quadratic interaction with the flaton one so that it is frozen at some value @xmath29 until the time when the flaton field is released from the origin and rolls down toward the minimum of the potential .",
    "this in turn signals the end of the thermal inflation era and the beginning of the oscillations of the curvaton field around the minimum of its quadratic potential @xcite .",
    "the flaton field , in addition to the non renormalisable terms with @xmath26 that stabilize the potential and make its slope in the @xmath5 direction be very flat , presents a quadratic interaction with the curvaton field .",
    "the complete expression for the potential is @xmath30 where @xmath31 due to the soft susy contributions in a gravity mediated susy breaking scheme , and @xmath3 is likely to be in the range @xmath32 gev according to the thermal inflation model discussed in where the curvaton field has some time to oscillate before decaying . under these circumstances",
    "the condition for an inflationary period , @xmath16 , is satisfied when the thermal energy density @xmath17 falls below @xmath18 .",
    "of course , this period of thermal inflation ends when the effect of the thermal background becomes unimportant , at a temperature @xmath33 , liberating the flaton field to roll down towards the minimum of the potential and letting it acquire a large vacuum expectation value @xmath12 given by : @xmath34    the thermal inflation model has been investigated before and found to be a very efficient mechanism to dilute the abundance of some unwanted relics , like the moduli fields , that the main inflationary epoch is not able to get rid of @xcite .",
    "we will constrain the available parameter space for @xmath1 and @xmath3 so that enough dilution of the moduli abundance is obtained . in ref .",
    "this was done for the case in which the flaton - curvaton coupling term gives a huge contribution to the mass of the curvaton when the flaton field is released and gets its vacuum expectation value @xmath12 .",
    "in that case the effective curvaton mass @xmath35 may become bigger than the hubble parameter giving birth to a period of curvaton oscillations and making the scale of the main inflationary period low enough ( @xmath36 , being @xmath37 the hubble parameter when the cosmological scales leave the horizon ) to think about the inflaton as a field associated to the susy breaking sector @xcite . the evolution of the energy densities associated to the different fluids in this case are sketched in fig .",

    "the lower bound on the curvaton decay rate @xmath42 coming from the requirement that the curvaton interactions must be at least of gravitational strength , is also increased when the flaton field acquires its vacuum expectation value .",
    "thus , if this increment is big enough for the curvaton decay rate to be bigger than the hubble parameter , the curvaton field may decay immediately rather than oscillating for some time .",
