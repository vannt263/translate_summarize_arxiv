    "the chemisorption of nitric oxide ( no ) and carbon monoxide ( co ) on transition metal surfaces has drawn much research attention due to the fundamental importance of these processes to applications in catalysis . in this study , we focus on the issue of density functional theory ( dft ) predictions of the chemisorption energy , @xmath0 , of no on transition metal surfaces .",
    "in particular , we investigate whether well - known shortcomings in dft predictions for @xmath0 of co manifest in no / metal systems .",
    "this so - called `` co / metal puzzle ''  @xcite can be summarized as the tendency for generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functionals ( such as pw91  @xcite , pbe  @xcite and rpbe  @xcite ) to place the empty co 2@xmath7 * orbital too low in energy relative to the metal @xmath2-band .",
    "this results in an unrealistic strengthening of the 2@xmath7 * - @xmath2-band interaction , which is reflected in an overestimation of the chemisorption bond strength .",
    "further insight into the co / metal puzzle can be obtained by considering the hammer - morikawa - norskov ( hmn ) model for the @xmath2-band contribution to co @xmath0",
    "the back - donation term , @xmath8 , thought to dominate chemisorption on late transition metal surfaces , is given by :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the idealized filling of the metal @xmath2 band , @xmath11 is the no @xmath7-surface coupling matrix element , @xmath12 is the energy of the renormalized 2@xmath7 * orbital relative to the fermi level , and @xmath13 is the first moment of the metal @xmath2-projected density of states relative to the fermi level .",
    "the hmn model predicts that larger values of @xmath11 give rise to greater back - donation , and based on overlap arguments @xmath11 is expected to increase with the extent of co - metal coordination .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : tm(111 ) ] , the ( 111 ) surface of fcc transition metals has four high - symmetry adsorption sites , which in order of increasing coordination are top ( t ) @xmath14 bridge ( b ) @xmath14 hcp hollow ( h ) @xmath15 fcc hollow ( f ) .",
    "thus , based on the hmn model interpretation of the co / metal puzzle , the 3-fold h and f sites will exhibit greater dft - gga overestimation of @xmath8 than the doubly coordinated b site or singly coordinated t site .",
    "several studies have traced the co / metal puzzle to its origins  @xcite , and various schemes have been developed to correct or address it  @xcite .",
    "one approach , a post - dft extrapolation procedure , was developed by grinberg and rappe in collaboration with one of the co - authors of this study  @xcite .",
    "the extrapolation procedure was based on the linear relationship between @xmath0 and the co singlet - triplet excitation energy @xmath16 , and was developed for different adsorption sites on ( 111 ) and ( 100 ) transition metal surfaces of pt , pd , rh , and cu .",
    "the linear trends were determined by changing the design of carbon and oxygen pseudopotentials sufficiently to achieve variation in the predicted properties .",
    "the linear trends obtained from the dft - gga calculations were then extrapolated to a @xmath16 value from a configuration interaction calculation .",
    "finally , the corresponding ordinates were taken to be the corrected values of @xmath17 .",
    "consistent with the above conceptual argument that the dft - gga error in @xmath18 will be larger for higher no - metal coordination , the slope @xmath19 / @xmath20 was found to have the greatest magnitude at hollow sites and the smallest magnitude at top sites .",
    "the accuracy of dft - gga predictions of @xmath0 for no on transition metals has been given less consideration than in the analogous case of co. this may be due in part to the fact that co preferentially adsorbs at top sites on several late transition metal surfaces . as the nature of the co / metal puzzle is to overestimate @xmath0 at highly coordinated sites more than at top sites , this leads to cases of incorrect site preference predictions for co in uncorrected dft - gga calculations  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , no exhibits an inherent preference to adsorb at highly coordinated sites on most late transition metal surfaces .",
    "therefore , the same overestimation of back - donation in no / metal systems will not result in the gross qualitative error of incorrect site preference as seen in many co / metal systems . instead",
    ", overestimation of @xmath21 in no / metal systems will only manifest quantitatively in calculated values of @xmath0 , in a site - specific fashion .",
    "in addition to there being no obvious problem with dft - gga predictions of no site preference , there are theoretical arguments for why overestimation of back - donation may not not occur .",
    "for example , in a comprehensive dft study  @xcite , a detailed comparison of co and no chemisorption is presented , and it is suggested that the partial occupation of the no 2@xmath1 orbital effectively `` pins '' the energy of that state to the fermi level , which prevents overestimation of back - donation .    in the present study , we demonstrate that in most adsorption geometries , the rehybridization of the no 2@xmath1 orbital in the chemisorbed state can give rise to new bonding and anti - bonding states .",
    "the no / metal 2@xmath1 rehybridization is compared to that in co / metal systems , and we interpret the results to support that dft - gga overestimation of @xmath8 does affect predictions for @xmath0 in no / metal systems . we demonstrate a linear relationship between no @xmath0 and @xmath6 , the energy of the g@xmath4 excitation of the free no molecule .",
    "we use these findings as the basis for the development of a post - dft extrapolation scheme in the style of mason and co - workers  @xcite . corrected values for @xmath17 do not in general affect the predicted no site preference , but do quantitatively change the values of @xmath0 by up to 18% .",
    "calculations are carried out using an in - house solid state dft code as used in previous studies  @xcite employing the pbe - gga exchange - correlation functional .",
    "norm - conserving optimized ( rrkj )  @xcite pseudopotentials with the designed nonlocal method for metals  @xcite or troullier and martins ( tm ) style  @xcite norm - conserving pseudopotentials are employed , generated using the opium pseudopotential package  @xcite . in all dft calculations ,",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals are expanded in a plane - wave basis set truncated at 50  ry .",
    "no chemisorption is modeled on the ( 111 ) surfaces of rh , pd , ir and pt .",
    "the theoretical lattice constants of face - centered unit cell for those metal species are determined to be 3.797 , 3.867 , 3.840 and 3.954   , respectively , based on polynomial fits and minimization of primitive bulk cell total energy _ vs. _ volume data points .",
    "models for the ( 111 ) surfaces are generated in @xmath22(4@xmath232 ) supercells ( shown in figure  [ fig : tm(111 ) ] ) comprised of five atomic layers of metal and at least 15.6    of vacuum separating periodic images in the surface normal direction . in all surface calculations , the first brillouin zone is sampled using a converged 4@xmath234@xmath231 grid of monkhorst - pack @xmath24-points  @xcite .",
    "no chemisorption is modeled at 1/4 ml coverage in each of the four adsorption sites t , b , h , and f ( figure  [ fig : tm(111 ) ] ) , with no bonding perpendicular to the surface ( except as noted ) and through n. geometry optimization for each structure , allowing for relaxation in the top two metal layers , is performed until the highest residual force is no larger than 0.01 ev /  . for the t site ,",
    "two sets of calculations are carried out , either imposing linear ( t@xmath25 ) or allowing for bent ( t@xmath26 ) chemisorbed no geometries .    in order to track changes in values of @xmath0 with variations in molecular no electronic structure , calculations of the no / metal systems using 4 distinct o pseudopotentials are carried out , with details of the o pseudopotential designs given in table  [ tab : psp ] .",
    "values for @xmath0 are calculated using    @xmath27    with this definition , chemisorption energies are reported in ev / no molecule , and negative values of @xmath0 represent favorable adsorption on the surface .    atomic state - by - state projected density of states ( pdos ) analysis is carried out by by projecting atomic valence pseudo - wavefunctions ( radial wavefunction multiplied by real combination of spherical harmonics ) of atoms onto all the kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "band centers are then calculated as the first moment of each projection . here",
    ", we are interested in monitoring how the states of no change in going from the free molecule to the chemisorbed state . to approximate the projection onto no @xmath7 and @xmath3 orbitals , we follow the approach of zeng and co - workers  @xcite and take linear combinations of n and o pdos :    @xmath28    @xmath29",
    "in our calculation using the o pseudopotential labeled psp 1 in table  [ tab : psp ] , the n - o bond length , @xmath30 of the free no molecule is 1.148   .",
    "this is in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.154   , though notably shorter than other dft - gga calculated results between 1.16  and 1.18    @xcite .",
    "we attribute the difference in @xmath30 to pseudopotential style , as the above referenced dft - gga values are all obtained using ultrasoft pseudoptoentials , while our study employs norm - conserving optimized pseudopotentials .",
    "the values for @xmath30 and other aspects of the optimized no / metal geometries using o psp 1 are presented in table  [ tab : geometry ] . for each metal surface and site",
    ", @xmath31 is up to 3.4% shorter than literature values for studies employing ultrasoft pseduoptoentials  @xcite , supporting systematic disagreement in @xmath30 between the two pseudoptoential approximations .",
    "for all metals , as expected , @xmath31 increases with increasing no - metal coordination . chemically speaking , the bond order of chemisorbed no decreases as @xmath30 increases .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : trends ] , calculations for @xmath0 using the four distinct o pseudopotentials exhibit a linear relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath32 , similar to the linear relationships previously reported between co @xmath0 and @xmath33  @xcite or co @xmath0 and the energy of the co 2@xmath1 orbital  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the correlation between no @xmath0 and @xmath6 is considered in terms of the charge transfer in the chemisorption and molecular excitation processes .",
    "the g@xmath34 excitation involves electron transfer from the no 5@xmath3 orbital to 2@xmath1 orbital , while back - donation in chemisorption involves charge transfer from the metal @xmath2-band into the 2@xmath1-derived bonding states .    in a style similar to mason _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , we extrapolate corrected values of the chemisorption energy @xmath35 , as shown in figure  [ fig : trends ] . the extrapolation process to calculate @xmath36",
    "is summarized as    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the experimental and dft - gga values for the no g@xmath4 excitation , respectively .",
    "her , we use a reported experimental value for @xmath6 62913.0 @xmath40 ( 7.80  ev ) as the calibration  @xcite . @xmath41",
    "/ @xmath42 indicates the so - called correction slope of the linear trend .",
    "all the @xmath36 results are given in table  [ tab : echem ] , alongside the uncorrected @xmath0 values obtained using o psp 1 .",
    "an overall picture picture presented by figure  [ fig : trends ] and table  [ tab : echem ] is that values of @xmath36 are smaller in magnitude than uncorrected @xmath0 , and the correction slope has a significant dependence on the adsorption site . the trends in @xmath41 / @xmath43 by site can be rationalized in terms of no - metal coordination and how the orbitals of adsorbate and substrate overlap . as discussed in the literature  @xcite , for t@xmath25 adsorption , the greatest contribution to the no - metal overlap is from the 5@xmath3 orbital of no molecule ( comprised of n and o atomic @xmath44 and @xmath45 orbitals ) , and the @xmath46-derived states of the chemisorbing surface atom . when there are two or three surface atoms coordinated with no , such as at b , h , or f sites , the metal atom - n - o angle is not linear , and this change in chemisorption geometry results in different dominant overlap interactions .",
    "specifically , in b , h , or f geometries , the no - metal overlap is dominated by interaction of the no 2@xmath1 orbital ( comprised of n and o atomic @xmath47 and @xmath48 orbitals ) , and the @xmath49- and @xmath50-derived states of the chemisorbing surface atoms .",
    "thus , as no - metal coordination increases , the overlap between no 2@xmath1 and the surface also increases , which causes the chemisorption bond to have more back - donation character .",
    "this leads to overestimation of @xmath8 , the relative extent of which can be tracked by the relative values of @xmath41 / @xmath51 for different sites .",
    "as foreshadowed , the result of extrapolating to @xmath52 does not impact the predicted no site preference in most cases , but does affect the magnitude of @xmath0 by up to 18% . the most favorable site before and after the correction is indicated in table  [ tab : echem ] .",
    "the one instance of altered site preference is for ir(111 ) , and this can be explained by the very close spacing of uncorrected @xmath0 values on that surface .",
    "qualitatively , our results for site preference are in agreement with previous theoretical results  @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , the values of @xmath36 reported here may be more reliable , and in particular the relative values of @xmath35 at different sites on the same metal may be important for interpreting how chemisorption evolves with coverage .",
    "for example , in the uncorrected values , the range of @xmath0 for different sites on rh(111 ) is 0.584  ev , while the range in @xmath35 is 0.310 .",
    "thus the corrected values predict a much smoother potential energy surface than the uncorrected values .",
    "the basis of our assertion that there is dft - gga overestimation of @xmath8 relies on the no 2@xmath1 orbital rehybridizing with the surface @xmath2-band to form new bonding and anti - bonding states in the no / metal system , similar to as seen in co chemisorption .",
    "this is at odds with the conclusion reported by gajdos and co - workers  @xcite , which alternatively states that the no 2@xmath1-derived states in no / metal systems span a single , narrow energy range close to the fermi level . in order to clarify the bonding interactions in no / metal systems ,",
    "we carry out comparative density of states analysis . in figure",
    "[ fig : pdos ] , the projections onto the pt @xmath2 , no @xmath7 , and no @xmath3 states is shown for no / pt(111 ) t@xmath25 and f sites .",
    "consistent with the interpretation of gajdos _ et al .",
    "_ , inspection of the pdos for the t@xmath25 site shows that the 2@xmath1 state , which we assign as the narrow and intense peak in the no @xmath7 pdos just above the fermi level , does not significantly hybridize with the pt @xmath2-band .",
    "however , in the pdos of the f configuration , the sharp peak in the no @xmath7 projection near the fermi level is diminished , and new broad intensity appears at bonding energies of 0 - 4  ev below the fermi level .",
    "thus the pdos provides evidence of charge transfer from the surface into no 2@xmath1-derived states at the f site , which also gives rise to a relatively large correction slope value of 0.19 . on the other hand , the absence of pdos evidence for 2@xmath1-pt hybridization in the t@xmath25 geometry is reflected in the negligible value of @xmath53 / @xmath54 for the t@xmath55 site .    for comparison , the pdos of co / pt(111 ) t@xmath25 and f",
    "are presented in figure  [ fig : pdos ] . a key distinction between the pdos of no / pt(111 ) and co / pt(111 )",
    "is noted for the t@xmath25 configurations : in co / pt(111 ) t@xmath25 , the co 2@xmath1 state does hybridize with the surface , while this behavior is absent in the no / pt(111 ) t@xmath55 . the fact that hybridization of the molecular 2@xmath1 states occurs at the f site but does not occur at the t@xmath25 site in no / pt(111 ) may be why it has been previously thought that no / metal systems are not subject to the same overestimation of @xmath56 as confirmed in co / metal systems .",
    "the pdos for no / pt(111 ) b and h sites , not shown , show behavior qualitatively similar to no / pt(111 ) h.    the chemisorption - induced charge transfer is further investigated by studying the changes in the occupation of no and co @xmath7 and @xmath3 states between the gas - phase and chemisorbed systems . using an analysis similar to as done by zeng and co - workers ,  @xcite fractional fillings of the chemisorbed no @xmath3 and @xmath7 projections",
    "are calculated and compared to the ideal molecular values .",
    "the changes in @xmath7 occupation , @xmath57 , and in @xmath3 occupation , @xmath58 , are reported in table  [ tab : charge ] , along with the sum net change in both occupations .",
    "for all of the no and co chemisorption systems , the positive values of @xmath57 reflect increased occupation of the @xmath7 states upon chemisorption , while the negative values of @xmath58 reflect decreased occupation of the @xmath3 states .",
    "the magnitude of ( @xmath59 ) increases with no - metal coordination .",
    "the trends in @xmath57 and @xmath58 for no and co support that simultaneous donation and back - donation contribute to the chemisorption process of both molecules , in agreement with other theoretical descriptions of no ( as in references  @xcite ) and co ( as in references  @xcite ) chemisorption . comparing the no / pt(11 ) and",
    "co / pt(111 ) systems , the larger @xmath57 values of the latter may be attributed to the empty occupation of the molecular co 2@xmath1 orbital .",
    "the comparative values of @xmath57 are also consistent with the relative magnitude of the correction slopes in no and co systems . for example , as previously reported for co , the correction slopes for rh , pd and pt(111 ) surfaces can be up to 0.26 for top site and 0.56 for hollow site  @xcite , while in this work that the correction slopes are near 0 for t@xmath25 sites and up to 0.25 for h and f sites ( table  [ tab : echem ] ) .",
    "the presented correction scheme requires calculations using multiple pseudopotentials to determine the values of @xmath41 / @xmath54 . in the co extrapolation procedure",
    ", it was noted that the correction slope values correlated with the co vibrational stretch frequency values for each site , with little dependence on the metal identity .",
    "while this afforded an approximate correction scheme for co / metal systems , the overlapping ranges for the no vibrational stretch frequency values at different sites as discussed in references  @xcite and  @xcite precludes such a short - cut for approximating @xmath41 / @xmath54 .",
    "however , we note that there is a correlation between the correction slope and calculated dipole moment , @xmath60 . here",
    "we define the electron distribution of n@xmath61-o@xmath62 as positive dipole moment , and n@xmath62-o@xmath61 as negative dipole moment . as recently reported and interpreted by deshlahra and co - workers  @xcite , the sign and magnitude of the dipole moment of values in no / metal exhibits site - specific trends , with t sites having @xmath60 @xmath63 0 , and h sites having @xmath60 @xmath14 0 .",
    "the pt(111 ) correction slopes for the five ( 111 ) adsorption sites and associated values of @xmath60 are given in table  [ tab : dipolecorrection ] .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : slope / dipole ] , our calculated values of @xmath60 demonstrate that the sign of @xmath60 changes from positive to negative as the no - metal coordination increases .",
    "simultaneously , the correction slopes grow grow larger , consistent with the greater extent of back - donation at highly coordinated adsorption sites .",
    "the relationship between @xmath60 and @xmath41 / @xmath64 enables an approximate scheme for determining correction slope . in this way",
    ", @xmath36 can be extrapolated using a smaller set of dft calculations . to test the @xmath60-based extrapolation scheme , we model the no / pt(100 ) chemisorption system and determine @xmath36 in two ways , first using the full extrapolation procedure and again by using the @xmath60-based correction detailed below .",
    "chemisorption energies using the @xmath60-based correction are denoted @xmath65 .",
    "this comparison is done for three adsorption sites on pt(100 ) surfaces shown in figure  [ fig : pt(100 ) ] : top ( t ) , bridge ( b ) , and the four - fold hollow site h@xmath66 .",
    "to carry out the dipole - based correction method , we first calculate @xmath0 and the corresponding dipole moment for no at the three sites on pt(100 ) using o psp 1 .",
    "the no / pt(100 ) values of @xmath60 are used along with the no / pt(111 ) trend between @xmath60 and @xmath41 / @xmath54 to approximate the no / pt(100 ) correction slope for each site .",
    "once the value of @xmath67 / @xmath54 is approximated , the correction method proceeds in the same fashion as detailed for the full method , using an experimental value for @xmath68 to arrive at values of @xmath65 .",
    "we suggest a range of no / pt(100 ) correction slope values based on the dipole correlation , and in figure  [ fig : dipolecorrection ] the resulting upper and lower bound @xmath36 values are shown . before correction ,",
    "the @xmath0 value for the pt(100 ) bridge site ( reported as the preferred geometry  @xcite ) is -2.109 ev ; after correction , the range of @xmath65 is -1.913 ev to -1.951 ev . as a comparison ,",
    "the full pseudopotential correction method is also performed and plotted in figure  [ fig : dipolecorrection ] .",
    "the result of -1.937 ev obtained from the full correction scheme is within the bounds of the dipole - based approximate correction method , supporting the validity and utility of the @xmath60-based correction .",
    "results for the remaining no / pt(100 ) sites using both the full and @xmath60-based correction method are given in table  [ tab : dipolecorrection ] .",
    "no chemisorption on rh , pd , ir , and pt(111 ) surfaces is studied to assess if over - estimation of back - donation leads to systematic errors in dft - gga predictions for @xmath0 .",
    "the electronic structure of no / metal and co / metal systems shows that , with the exception of linear top site adsorption , the no 2@xmath1 orbital does rehybridize with the surface @xmath2-band to form new bonding and anti - bonding states , similar to what is seen in the analogous co / metal systems .",
    "linear trends of no @xmath0 _ vs. _ @xmath6 are obtained by calculations utilizing different o pseudopotentials , and a post - dft correction scheme for no @xmath0 is constructed after the style of a co chemisorption energy extrapolation procedure  @xcite . in the case of no , the @xmath17 correction does not impact the predicted site preference .",
