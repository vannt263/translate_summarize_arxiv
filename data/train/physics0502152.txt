    "complex behavior in systems far from equilibrium can quite often be traced back to rather simple laws due to the existence of processes of selforganization @xcite . since",
    "complex systems are composed of a huge number of subsystems , however , fluctuations stemming from the microscopic degrees of freedom play an important role introducing a temporal variation on a fast time scale which quite often can be considered as fluctuations .",
    "the consequence is the existence of evolution equations of a set of macroscopic order parameters @xmath0 which are governed by nonlinear langevin equations @xcite , @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath0 denotes the n - dimensional state vector , @xmath2 is the drift vector and the matrix @xmath3 is related to the diffusion matrix according to @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 are fluctuating forces with gaussian statistics delta - correlated in time : @xmath6 , @xmath7 . here and in the following we adopt it s interpretation of stochastic integrals",
    "@xcite , @xcite .    analyzing complex systems , which can be described by stochastic equations of the form ( [ lange ] ) , therefore , amounts to assess the underlying langevin equations or the corresponding fokker - planck equations from an inspection of experimentally determined time series @xcite .",
    "recently , an operational method @xcite , @xcite has been devised , which allows one to estimate drift and diffusion coefficients of the stochastic processes from experimental data .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to various problems in the field of complex systems like the analysis of noisy electrical circuits @xcite , stochastic dynamics of metal cutting @xcite , systems with feedback delay @xcite , meteorological processes like wind - driven southern ocean variability @xcite , traffic flow data @xcite and physiological time series @xcite .",
    "furthermore it has been applied to problems like turbulent flows @xcite , @xcite , passive scalar advection @xcite , financial time series @xcite , analysis of rough surfaces @xcite , @xcite , which can be characterized as a stochastic process with respect to a scale variable exhibiting markovian properties in scale .    the method is based on the evaluation of the time limits the first and second conditional moments ,    [ est ] @xmath8_{i}\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ { \\bf q}(t+\\tau)-{\\bf q}(t)]_{j}|{\\bf q}(t)={\\bf q}>\\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from these expressions it becomes evident that the sampling rate in the experiments has to be sufficiently high in order to allow for a reliable evaluation of the limit @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , in all applications mentioned above the results have been checked in a selfconsistent manner by a recalculation of conditional pdf s from the estimated fokker - planck equation .",
    "possible problems in estimating drift and diffusion coefficients related with low sampling frequencies have been adressed by sura @xcite , ragwitz and kantz @xcite , @xcite and friedrich et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present letter is to devise an extension of the above method in order to overcome problems related with the time limit @xmath10 .",
    "these problems immediately show up for low sampling rates .",
    "we also want to point out that for the case of stochastic forces @xmath5 with small but finite temporal correlations the process is not markovian in the limit @xmath11 . in this case , however , one should use the stratonovich interpretation of stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "the starting point is a first estimate of drift and diffusion coefficients by the expressions ( [ est ] ) evaluated for the smallest reliably possible values of @xmath12 .",
    "the second step is an embedding of drift and diffusion coefficients into a family of functions @xmath13 , @xmath14 parameterized by a set of free parameters @xmath15 .",
    "the expressions obtained in the first step already yield a crude estimate of the parameters @xmath15 .",
    "the third step consists in optimizing the free parameters @xmath16 .",
    "optimization of the free parameters can be performed in the following way .",
    "one determines the conditional probability distribution @xmath17 for the parameter set @xmath16 either by a simulation of the langevin equations or by a numerical solution of the corresponding fokker - planck equation . in each case",
    ", one can determine the two point pdf @xmath18 .",
    "the reader should note that this may be done for various finite values of @xmath19 .",
    "the obtained two time pdf can now be compared with the experimental one . a suitable measure for the distance",
    "is the kullback - leibler information @xcite defined according to @xmath20    the minimum of the kullback - leibler information with respect to the parameters @xmath16 yields estimates of drift and diffusion of a stochastic process .",
    "this process is the best approximation with respect to this measure in the class of stochastic processes characterized by the parameters @xmath16 .",
    "the problem of identifying a stochastic process is then equivalent to determining a minimum of the kullback information . in practice",
    "the minimum can be determined by gradient or genetic algorithms and solved by standard methods @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall consider cases , where it is possible to obtain a parametrization of the stochastic processes by only few parameters @xmath15 such that the kullback - leibler measure can be investigated by graphical means .",
    "for certain classes of stochastic processes the above procedure can be reduced considerably by the fact that only few free parameters for the parametrization of drift and diffusion terms have to be introduced . as a consequence the minimization procedure of the kullback - leibler information",
    "is greatly facilitated .",
    "the case of one - dimensional systems allows for the following treatment due to the fact that the stationary pdf , which is assumed to exist , can be determined analytically : @xmath21 as a consequence , we have the relationship @xmath22    since @xmath23 can be determined from the time series an estimate in terms of a parameterized ansatz for the diffusion term suffices .",
    "in fact , one may use the ansatz @xmath24 , which helps in lowering the number of parameters @xmath15 to be estimated by the above procedure of minimization the kullback - leibler information .",
    "the drift then follows from ( [ multnoise ] ) .     as function of the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 for time",
    "series i. the lines are equidistant contour lines starting from @xmath27 in the center .",
    "the distance between contour lines is @xmath28 .",
    "a clear minimum is located at @xmath29.,width=325 ]    let us consider system i with drift and diffusion functions @xmath30 driven by a multiplicative noise term .",
    "we use synthetic data obtained by numerical integration of the corresponding langevin equation @xcite , @xmath31+\\sqrt{\\tilde{\\tau}}d^2\\left[q(t)\\right]\\gamma(t)\\quad.\\ ] ] a time series containing @xmath32 points with time increment @xmath33 was generated .",
    "the intrinsic increment @xmath34 used for numerical integration of the corresponding langevin equation was @xmath35 .",
    "a time segment of the data is presented in fig .",
    "[ mult01u2.dat ] . since the stochastic process is stationary and ergodic all statistical quantities can be retrieved from this data .",
    "for the estimation of the pdf s from data state space has to be divided into bins .",
    "we used @xmath36 equidistant bins for the stationary pdf . a very accurate way to calculate the integral yielding the kullback - leibler distance without running out of memory even for higher dimensional data is to use an adequate local grid for the first argument ( the destination ) of the conditional pdf s .",
    "the conditional pdf then locally can be retrieved from the data for any @xmath37 with high accuracy . the local grid used in this example covered @xmath38 equidistant bins .    during the iteration procedure the two point pdf s have to be calculated .",
    "we again use the numerical simulation of langevin processes as a very efficient way to generate these pdf s .    starting from the estimates ( [ est ] )",
    "the ansatz @xmath39 is reasonable .",
    "the drift immediately follows from ( [ multnoise ] ) and , for each parameter set @xmath40 , one obtains a stationary distribution that equals the experimental one .",
    "due to this fact the evaluation of the conditional pdf @xmath41 suffices to calculate the kullback - leibler distance .",
    "a clear minimum of the distance is found at @xmath29 corresponding to the original set of parameters .",
    "the kullback distance close to this minimum in the two - dimensional parameter space is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ mult02.out ] .           as a function of the noise strength @xmath25 ( time series ii ) .",
    "a minimum is clearly visible at the value @xmath42.,width=325 ]    the procedure for one - dimensional systems can be immediately extended to higher dimensions if one restricts the analysis to the so - called class of potential systems for which the drift vector @xmath43 is obtained from a potential @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the central point of our analysis is the following exact expression for the stationary pdf    @xmath46    since the stationary pdf can be estimated from experimental data one may parameterize the class of stochastic processes by the single variable @xmath25 .",
    "thus the drift function can be taken to be fixed except for the value @xmath25 :    @xmath47    as an example we consider the two - dimensional system @xmath48\\\\ \\epsilon q_{2}-q_{2}\\left[bq_{1}^2+q_{2}^2\\right]\\end{array}\\right ) \\qquad .\\ ] ] this dynamical system arises as order parameter equations for instabilities in nonequilibrium systems and has applications from the fields of pattern formation in nonequilibrium systems to pattern recognition @xcite .",
    "it exhibits the features of multistability and selection .",
    "we considered the case @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( time series ii ) .",
    "these parameters yield four stable fixpoints of the dynamics on the axes at @xmath51 and unstable fixpoints at the origin and on the bisectional lines at @xmath52 .",
    "data with time increments @xmath53 for the datapoints has been generated with a time step @xmath35 for the integration of the langevin equations .",
    "the simulated time series ii with @xmath54 consists of @xmath55 data points .",

    "we analyzed the time series as outlined above .",
    "state space in this case is divided in @xmath56 equidistant bins . since",
    "the drift @xmath57 can be evaluated from ( [ add_final ] ) all parameters are fixed except for the noise strength @xmath25 .",
    "after evaluating the kullback measure for various values of @xmath25 this value has to be optimized .",
    "the optimal value is determined by the minimum of the kullback distance . for the present case the minimum",
    "can easily be determined by graphical means .    .",
    "unstable fixpoints in the center and on the bisectional line as well as the attractive fixpoints are clearly visible.,width=325 ]    fig .",
    "[ feb002.out ] shows the kullback distance @xmath58 as a function of the noise strength q for the time series ii .",
    "the minimum is clearly visible at @xmath42 and agrees with the one used for simulation . with this parameter the drift vector field",
    "can be recalculated from the stationary distribution based on relation ( [ add_final ] ) .",
    "the resulting drift vector field of dataset ii is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ feb002.drift ] .",
    "summarizing , we have outlined an operational method for the estimation of drift and diffusion terms from experimental time series of stochastic langevin processes .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches the present algorithm does not rely on estimating conditional moments in the small time increment limit .",
    "although this limit yields a first approximation an iterative refinement of the estimated stochastic process is performed by minimization of the kullback - leibler distance between estimated and measured two time probability distributions .",
    "the proposed procedure solves the problem of estimating drift and diffusion terms of langevin processes from time series .",
    "it involves the numerical solution of langevin equations with parameter dependent drift and diffusion terms , an evaluation of the kullback - leibler integral ( which may be determined by means of a monte - carlo method ) and an optimization procedure , for which standard approaches can be used .",
    "all involved steps are based on routine calculations .",
    "furthermore , restriction to certain classes of stochastic processes like potential systems can drastically lower the numerical efforts of the procedure .",
    "therefore , the proposed algorithm can be applied also to systems with higher dimensional state spaces .",
