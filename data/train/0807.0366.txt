    "alice is an experiment at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) primarily designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter in nucleus - nucleus collisions@xcite .",
    "the alice detector consists of a central barrel , a forward muon arm , and a set of smaller , forward detectors .    the central barrel , which covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath0  0.9 , has a charged particle tracking system consisting of an inner tracking system ( its ) in combination with a cylindrical time - projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "particle identification is obtained from the energy loss in the tracking detectors in combination with information from a time - of - flight ( tof ) detector , a transition radiation detector ( trd ) , and an imaging cherenkov detector ( hmpid ) .",
    "in addition , the central barrel contains a high resolution photon spectrometer ( phos ) and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) .",
    "the hmpid , phos and emcal cover only parts of the central barrel acceptance .",
    "the central barrel is designed to be able to handle multiplicities up to @xmath1  8000 , a conservative estimate of the maximum multiplicities expected in central pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "all charged tracks with transverse momenta ( @xmath2 ) greater than @xmath3  gev / c can be reconstructed , with a momentum resolution changing from about 0.7% at @xmath4  gev / c to 3.5% at @xmath5  gev / c .",
    "the muon arm covers the pseudorapidity range -2.5  @xmath6  -4.0 and consists of an arrangement of absorbers , a large dipole magnet , ten planes of cathode pad tracking chambers , and four planes of resistive - plate triggering chambers .",
    "the muon arm is capable of reconstructing @xmath7 and @xmath8 vector mesons through their di  muon decay channel with transverse momenta down to @xmath9  0 and with a resolution in invariant mass of 70 and 100  mev / c@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "several smaller detectors are located at forward angles .",
    "these are the photon multiplicity detector ( pmd ) , the forward multiplicity detector ( fmd ) , the t0 and v0 detectors , and the zero - degree calorimeters ( zdc ) .",
    "the t0 , cherenkov radiation detectors , and v0 , plastic scintillators , cover about 0.5 and 2.0 units of pseudorapidity , respectively , on each side of the interaction point .",
    "signals from the v0 , t0 , its ( si - pixel ) , tof , trd , phos , emcal , and the muon trigger chambers are available in the lowest alice trigger level ( level  0 ) . the zdcs are located too far from the interaction point to be included in level  0 , but the information is available in the higher trigger levels .",
    "an outline of the alice detector is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "ultra - peripheral collisions will have a very different topology compared with the central , hadronic interactions , which are the main focus of the alice experiment .",
    "the versatility of the alice detector should allow these interactions to be studied , however , but they will require different trigger and analysis techniques .",
    "ultra - peripheral collisions can be studied both with heavy - ion and proton beams .",
    "the photons from the electromagnetic field of one of the nuclei ( or protons ) can interact with the other nucleus in several ways",
    ". the interaction can be purely electromagnetic ( two - photon interaction ) or the photon can interact hadronically with the target nucleus ( photonuclear interaction ) .",
    "the photonuclear interactions can either lead to the target nucleus breaking up ( `` inelastic '' ) or remaining intact ( `` elastic '' ) .",
    "the photonuclear interactions can be further subdivided depending on if the photon first fluctuates to a hadronic state ( resolved interactions ) or if it interacts as a bare photon ( direct interactions ) .",
    "two - photon and elastic photonuclear interactions are characterized by two rapidity gaps void of particles on both side of the produced system .",
    "if the fields couple coherently to the entire nucleus , the total transverse momentum will be determined by the nuclear form factors and will typically be small compared with that for competing processes .",
    "the inelastic photonuclear interactions have a single rapidity gap between the photon - emitting nucleus and the produced system .",
    "the cross section for inelastic photonuclear interactions is dominated by resolved processes , but the cross sections for direct photon - parton interactions are large .",
    "for example , the cross section to produce a @xmath11pair through @xmath12gluon fusion in pb+pb collisions is about 1  barn at the lhc@xcite.the cross section for photon - induced di - jet production is also appreciable with , e.g. , a cross section larger than 1  @xmath13b for jets with @xmath14  50  gev / c and rapidity @xmath15  1 in pb+pb collisions@xcite .",
    "the elastic photonuclear reactions are dominated by exclusive vector meson production@xcite . for comparable final states , the cross sections for two - photon production",
    "are typically two or three orders of magnitude smaller than for photonuclear production .",
    "the characteristics of ultra - peripheral collisions form the basis for defining the trigger and separating the ultra - peripheral events from the hadronic interactions and various types of background processes .",
    "alice is designed to handle multiplicities of several thousand particles in a single event .",
    "the multiplicities in ultra - peripheral collisions are normally much lower and reconstructing the events should not pose a problem .",
    "the key challenge is instead to implement an efficient trigger .    in central collisions",
    ", it is possible to trigger on charged particles emitted outside the acceptance of the central barrel , since the produced particles are distributed more or less evenly over the entire rapidity interval .",
    "the default trigger for hadronic interactions is therefore based on a coincident signal in the v0 and t0 detectors on both sides of the interaction point .",
    "for ultra - peripheral collisions , the idea is instead to let the v0 and t0 detectors define rapidity gaps by requiring an absence of a signal in those detectors in coincidence with a low multiplicity trigger around mid - rapidity .",
    "the low multiplicity trigger can be implemented through the si - pixel and tof detectors in the central barrel or through the muon trigger chambers . for two - photon and elastic photonuclear interactions , the t0 and v0 detectors on both sides",
    "should be empty , whereas for inelastic photonuclear interactions one should require a signal in the v0 and t0 on one side while the other side should be empty .",
    "alice should have the capability to study many different types of ultra - peripheral collisions , with and without breakup of the nuclei .",
    "the focus so far has , however , been on exclusive production where both nuclei remain intact , in particular exclusive vector meson production .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail for heavy - ion and proton - proton interactions in the following two sections .",
    "pairs in ultra - peripheral pb+pb collisions .",
    "the dashed histogram shows the continuum contribution from two - photon interactions.,width=245 ]",
    "at high photon energies and low virtualities , a photon may fluctuate into a vector meson and remain in that state for times that are long compared with the time it takes for it to pass nuclear distances . while in the vector meson state , the photon may scatter diffractively off the target nucleus and emerge as a real vector meson .",
    "the cross sections for exclusive photoproduction of vector mesons are large in heavy - ion interactions at the lhc@xcite .",
    "table  1 shows the the cross sections and expected detection rates for @xmath16 , j/@xmath17 , and @xmath8 in alice in a one month ( 10@xmath18  s ) pb+pb run .",
    "the detection rates were calculated from the geometrical acceptance of the central barrel ( @xmath0  0.9 , @xmath14  0.2  gev / c ) .    in this section ,",
    "the possibilities to reconstruct exclusively produced j/@xmath17 and @xmath19 mesons in the alice central barrel will be discussed .",
    "the j/@xmath17 and @xmath19 are assumed to decay via their @xmath20 decay channel .",
    "the dominating background process is expected to be continuum production of @xmath20pairs in two - photon interactions@xcite .",
    "other backgrounds include hadronic interactions in peripheral nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions , beam - gas interactions , cosmic rays ( mainly at the trigger level ) , and incoherent photonuclear interactions .",
    "these backgrounds have been studied through simulations@xcite .",
    "the results show that the coherent and exclusive events can be identified with good signal to background ratios when the entire event is reconstructed and a cut is applied on the summed @xmath2 of the event .",
    "this is confirmed by the measurements of exclusive production of @xmath16 and j/@xmath17 mesons at rhic , where similar techniques were used@xcite .",
    "a simulation has been performed based on 1.5 hours of running at a pb+pb luminosity of @xmath21  @xmath22s@xmath23 .",
    "three samples of events were generated : 375,000 @xmath24 events with an invariant mass of the @xmath20pairs greater than 1.5 gev / c@xmath10 ( @xmath25  140  mb ) ; 5,141 j/@xmath17 events ( @xmath26  1.9  mb ) ; and 122 @xmath19 events ( @xmath27=  45  @xmath13b ) .",
    "the events were processed through aliroot , the framework for the alice detector response simulation and off - line event reconstruction .",
    "the simulation gave about 3,500 reconstructed @xmath24 continuum pairs , 500 reconstructed j/@xmath17s and 10 reconstructed @xmath19s .",
    "the vector meson decay products and the continuum @xmath20pairs have very different angular distributions and thus different acceptances .",
    "the simulation did not include the vertex reconstruction efficiency ( @xmath2885  % for two - track events ) and the electron / positron identification efficiency .    the invariant mass spectrum of the reconstructed @xmath20pairs is shown in fig .",
    "2 . a clear j/@xmath17 peak is visible above the continuum background .",
    "the 10 reconstructed @xmath19 can not be distinguished from the background with the current statistics .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + the geometrical acceptances for j/@xmath17 and @xmath8 are different compared with those in @xcite .",
    "the earlier values were incorrect because of incorrect angular distributions of the decay products in the event generator .",
    "as was mentioned above , the identification of the coherently produced vector mesons and two - photon events will rely on the low @xmath2 of the final state .",
    "the generated distribution is shown in fig .  3 a ) .",
    "it is the result of a convolution of the photon @xmath2 spectrum with the form factor of the target nucleus . the corresponding distribution for the reconstructed events is shown in fig .",
    "3 b ) . because of the finite momentum resolution , the reconstructed distribution is wider than the generated one , but it is still clearly peaked below @xmath29  100  mev / c .",
    "this shows that the momentum resolution is good enough for the summed @xmath2 to be used to identify the events .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath2 in fig .  3 is the @xmath2 of the final state ( the vector meson or the two - photon system ) .",
    "the electrons / positrons have transverse momenta of about 1.5  gev / c .",
    "pairs in ultra - peripheral proton - proton collisions .",
    "the dashed histogram shows the continuum contribution from two - photon interactions.,width=245 ]         exclusive vector meson production can be studied also in proton - proton ( pp ) collisions .",
    "this reaction channel is interesting for several reasons . in pp collisions ,",
    "odderon - pomeron fusion is a competing process by which vector mesons can be produced@xcite .",
    "this could also occur in nucleus - nucleus collisions , but one expects photoproduction to dominate there . if the cross section for photoproduction can be accurately determined , for example by using data from hera , any excess can be attributed to the odderon .",
    "one furthermore expects the odderon and photon to have different @xmath2 spectra .",
    "if the odderon contribution can be separated , measuring exclusive production of @xmath8 in pp collisions at the lhc could improve the statistics and the energy range of the measurements of exclusive photoproduction of @xmath8 at hera .",
    "finally , it has been proposed to use two - photon production of di - lepton pairs for luminosity calibration in pp collisions .",
    "photoproduction of vector mesons will then be an important background that must be understood .",
    "a simulation similar to that for pb+pb collisions has been performed based on about 18 days of running at the alice p+p luminosity @xmath30  @xmath22s@xmath23 .",
    "this luminosity is a factor @xmath31 lower than the lhc design luminosity because of the long dead time of the tpc .",
    "three samples of events were generated for pp collisions : 150,000 @xmath24 events with an invariant mass of the @xmath20pairs greater than 1.5 gev / c@xmath10 ( @xmath25  19  nb ) ; 35,796 j/@xmath17 events ( @xmath26  4.5  nb ) ; and 729 @xmath19 events ( @xmath26  91  pb ) .",
    "as for pb+pb , the pp events were processed through the alice detector response simulation and off - line event reconstruction .",
    "the simulation gave about 700 reconstructed @xmath24 continuum pairs , 1,400 reconstructed j/@xmath17s and 30 reconstructed @xmath19s .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum of the reconstructed @xmath20pairs is shown in fig .",
    "one notes that the continuum background from two - photon interactions is much smaller in pp compared with pb+pb collisions .",
    "the background is small enough for the peak from the 30 reconstructed @xmath19s to be visible .    the reconstructed transverse momentum and rapidity distributions are shown in fig .",
    "5 a ) and b ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 spectrum is considerably wider than in heavy - ion collisions , and not very different from that of background processes , because of the different form factors .",
    "the identification of the exclusive production must therefore rely more on the presence of rapidity gaps in pp collisions .",
    "the rates for many interesting ultra - peripheral reaction channels are high within the acceptance of the alice detector .",
    "this study shows that with a suitable trigger these events can be reconstructed with high efficiency in alice .",
    "the momentum resolution is good enough for the summed @xmath2 to be used to identify coherent events in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
