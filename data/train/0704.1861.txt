    "we prove a theorem of existence and well - posedness of the solutions .",
    "in section 4 we prove the following theorem :    _ suppose that the initial data @xmath45 @xmath26 and @xmath46 such that @xmath47 then for some @xmath48 there exist @xmath49 and a unique solution of - in a certain time @xmath50 and the solution @xmath21 is time locally well - posed , i. e. , the solution continuously depends on the initial data .",
