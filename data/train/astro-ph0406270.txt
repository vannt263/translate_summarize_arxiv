    "in the search for extra - solar planets , indirect methods have been used to detect the more than 100 planets discovered thus far ( e.g. , @xcite ) . of the indirect methods ,",
    "the use of transits @xcite is rapidly developing into a strong and viable means to detect extra - solar planets .",
    "a transit occurs when the apparent brightness of a star decreases temporarily due to an orbiting planet passing between the observer and the stellar disk , leaving a photometric signature of the planet in the lightcurve of the parent star .",
    "the radial velocity surveys have shown that roughly 7% of sun - like ( f5k5 ) stars in the solar neighbourhood are orbited by a jupiter - mass companion in the orbital range 0.0354.0 au .",
    "moreover , 0.5%1% of sun - like stars in the solar neighbourhood have a jupiter - mass companion in a 0.05 au ( 35 day ) orbit @xcite .",
    "if the orbital plane of these `` hot jupiters '' is randomly oriented , approximately 10% ( averaged over all sun - like stars ) will transit the face of their parent star as seen by an observer .",
    "thus roughly 1 sun - like star in 1000 will produce detectable transits due to an extra - solar planet .",
    "since this transit method clearly favours large planets orbiting their parent stars at small orbital radii , a large sample of stars must be monitored in order to detect statistically meaningful numbers of transiting planets .    over the entire sky , roughly 1000 stars brighter than 13th magnitude should be exhibiting lightcurve dips due to transiting jupiter - mass extra - solar planets .",
    "the photometric accuracy required to reliably detect a transiting planet in a 35 day orbit is considerably higher than that typically necessary for ccd photometry of variable stars , since starlight dims by about 1% for a few hours during each orbital period .",
    "because thousands of lightcurves must be studied to find one that exhibits transits , a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of at least 610 is needed to reliably detect the transits . since the cost of detecting transiting planets can be dominated by the cost of a ccd , it is useful to test if commercial large - format ccd cameras are able to achieve milli - magnitude accuracy on 1 hour timescales , and thus sufficient accuracy to be able to reliably detect transits .",
    "success would show that a large number of similar cameras could be relatively cheaply deployed in order to monitor the entire sky for transits .",
    "we present first results from the wide angle search for planets prototype ( hereafter wasp0 ) , a wide - field instrument used to search for planetary transits .",
    "we describe the data reduction methods and show that the required accuracy can be achieved with this instrument provided that sources of systematic errors are treated appropriately .",
    "observations of the known transiting planet , hd 209458b , are presented as well as a selection of other stars in the field which exhibit transit - like lightcurves .",
    "the wasp0 instrument was developed as a proof - of - concept instrument similar to vulcan @xcite to search for planetary transits , and as a precursor to superwasp @xcite , a more advanced instrument that has recently been constructed on la palma , canary islands .",
    "wasp0 is an inexpensive prototype for superwasp , whose primary aim is to detect transiting extra - solar planets .",
    "the wasp0 instrument is a wide - field ( 9-degree ) 6.3 cm aperture f/2.8 nikon camera lens , apogee 10 ccd detector ( 2k @xmath0 2k chip , 16-arcsec pixels ) which was built by don pollacco at queen s university , belfast .",
    "calibration frames were used to measure the gain and readout noise of the chip and were found to be 15.44 e@xmath1/adu and 1.38 adu respectively .",
    "images from the camera are digitized with 14-bit precision giving a data range of 016383 adus .",
    "figure 1 shows the expected wasp0 sensitivity with the main losses resulting from the ccd quantum efficiency .",
    "the instrument uses a clear filter which has a slightly higher red transmission than blue .        during its observing run on la palma , canary islands",
    ", wasp0 was mounted piggy - back on a commercial 8-inch celestron telescope with a german equatorial mount .",
    "more recently at kryoneri , greece , wasp0 was mounted on a 10-inch meade with a fork equatorial mount .",
    "wasp0 has had two successful observing runs at two separate sites .",
    "the first observing run was undertaken on la palma , canary islands during 2000 june 20  2000 august 20 .",
    "the second observing run took place at kryoneri , greece between 2001 october  2002 may . in order to monitor sufficient numbers of stars for successful planetary transit detection",
    ", a wide field needs to be combined with reasonably crowded star fields .",
    "observations on la palma concentrated on a field in draco which was regularly monitored for two months .",
    "more recent observations from greece have largely been of the hyades open cluster along with further observations of the draco field .",
    "observations of the draco field from la palma were interrupted on four occasions when a planetary transit of hd 209458 was predicted . on those nights ,",
    "a large percentage of time was devoted to observing the hd 209458 field in pegasus .",
    "this paper details results from the pegasus field while the results from the draco and hyades observations will be published elsewhere .",
    "the fields centre for each field monitored by wasp0 is shown in table 1 .",
    ".field centres of wasp0 observations ( j2000.0 ) [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     the monitoring program of wasp0 is ideal for detecting many kinds of stellar variability . as a result ,",
    "the pegasus field data have yielded lightcurves of stars whose variable nature was previously unknown .",
    "shown in figure 10 are four examples of stars in the field which exhibit variable behaviour identified by the transit detection algorithm .",
    "clearly each of these stars are either too deep or too variable to be a genuine planetary transits and are likely to to be eclipsing or grazing eclipsing binaries .",
    "a comprehensive study of new variable stars discovered in the pegasus field will be published elsewhere .",
    "we have described an inexpensive prototype survey camera designed to monitor a wide - field on - sky area and hunt for transiting extra - solar planets .",
    "large datasets have so far been obtained of fields in draco and hyades with some additional nights monitoring pegasus at predicted transit times of the known extra - solar planet hd 209458b .",
    "a pipeline has been developed which makes use of the tycho-2 and usno - b catalogue to provide an astrometric solution for each frame .",
    "the transformed source list is then used to perform weighted aperture photometry at the location of each object in the catalogue .",
    "the resulting analysis of wasp0 pegasus data presented here demonstrates that this instrument is able to achieve millimag photometry and hence the necessary precision required to detect transit events due to extra - solar planets .",
    "a transit detection algorithm has been described and has shown that it is effective at extracting stars with exhibit transit - like behaviour from the bulk of the dataset .",
    "it is unfortunate that the wasp0 camera only observed using a clear filter .",
    "this means that multi - colour follow - up observations of transit candidates , needed to distinguish other possible physical scenarios , will be required to be sought after elsewhere .",
    "this prototype has successfully served as a proof - of - concept for superwasp , a robotically operated , multi - camera instrument recently constructed on la palma .",
    "the primary science goal of the superwasp project is to use the well - sampled lightcurves to detect planetary transits , but the data will also be used to detect near - earth objects and optical transients .",
    "the authors would like to thank aleksander schwarzenberg - czerny for useful discussions regarding the transit detection algorithm .",
    "the authors would also like to thank pparc for supporting this research and the nichol trust for funding the wasp0 hardware .",
