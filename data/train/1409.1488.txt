    "this question underlies a fundamental connection between deterministic chaos and statistical mechanics .",

    "a connection between transport property and chaotic microscopic motion was proposed on the base of an experiment more than fifteen years ago @xcite .",
    "considering the brownian movement of a colloidal particle in water , the authors concluded that the sum of positive lyapunov exponents is positive .",
    "since lyapunov exponents measure whether the dynamics sensitively depends on the initial conditions , this quantity seemed to present for the first time a direct connection of microscopic dynamical instability to relaxation properties of a many - body system , propounded in the classic work of krylov @xcite .",
    "krylov had laid the dynamical foundations of lorentz gas and estimated the lyapunov exponent for this system .",
    "an enormous amount of work has been carried out since then , summarized in reviews and books @xcite .",
    "subsequent to the work by gaspard et al .",
    "@xcite , there has been a vibrant debate where , mainly , at the centre of the debate is the gas with polygonal scatterers .",
    "we call this the ehrenfest gas to distinguish it from the lorentz gas where the scatterers are circular in shape . due to the absence of curved segments of the scatterers in the ehrenfest gas",
    ", there is no exponential separation of infinitesimally separated trajectories and thus the lyapunov exponent is zero .",
    "dettmann et al .",
    "@xcite argued that while an estimate of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy was given in @xcite , based on time series recorded from positions of a colloidal particle moving in a fluid ; very similar results were obtained for certain models with strictly zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "numerical experiments on the wind - tree model confirmed these arguments @xcite . a mixture of normal and anomalous diffusive behaviour of point particles moving along a polygonal channel was observed in careful numerical experiments by alonso et al .",
    "thus , at the microscopic level , it is not clear what degree of non - integrability @xcite is necessary to ensure typical transport properties @xcite .    for calculating the lyapunov exponent of the lorentz gas , sinai and dorfman @xcite",
    "have considered a narrow beam of two rays separated by an infinitesimal angle @xmath0 and calculated the typical time evolution of the separation .",
    "suppose the ends of the rays are a part of a circular wavefront of radius @xmath1 before a collision , one may use the well - known mirror formula for reflection off a concave surface to determine the radius @xmath2 of the wavefront after collision .",
    "this result is crucial for their calculation of the lyapunov exponent . in calculating the lyapunov exponent , as mentioned above ,",
    "the beam is considered infinitesimally narrow so that its bounding rays suffer collision with the same set of scatterers arranged in a periodic manner . for the ehrenfest gas , this",
    "can also be achieved",
    ". however , there appears a time during the evolution when a part of the beam falls on one side of an @xmath3-sided polygonal scatterer , whereas the other part strikes an adjacent side .",
    "this happens for a beam that is not infinitesimal , and , for scatterers with @xmath3 large .",
    "here we provide a definition of a finite - time exponent for pseudochaotic systems like the ehrenfest gas , by taking into account the relation between curvatures before and after the beam splits .",
    "to summarize , there are two main results we present - a collision rule to quantitatively describe beam splitting , and , an exponent incorporating this rule in the formulation due to sinai @xcite , with an estimate of the time over which this exponent may be used .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a regime of low density of randomly placed scatterers as analytic estimates become too hard for higher densities . as the number of sides of the polygonal scatterers increases ,",
    "the expressions found by us recover the well - known results for the circular scatterers .",
    "thus , in a sense , chaos emerges from pseudochaos .",
    "we recall that finite - time lyapunov exponents are defined for chaotic systems also but the system we are dealing with here is a non - chaotic , non - integrable one ( we have called this pseudo - chaotic ) @xcite .",

    "is given by @xmath69 at each collision , the angle @xmath0 is multiplied by a quantity @xmath70 , which is independent of @xmath0 , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : circref ] ) . however , for the ehrenfest gas , the angle of the beam after a collision with a polygonal scatterer is @xmath71 once the beam strikes a vertex , @xmath72 , @xmath0 increases almost algebraically as @xmath73 is roughly proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "since for the lorentz gas @xmath0 increases multiplicatively , for any howsoever large time @xmath74 , the initial angle can be chosen to make @xmath75 so small so as to ensure that the full beam hits the same scatterers with probability _ equal _ to unity .",
    "hence the limit @xmath76 can be taken in ( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "for the ehrenfest gas , this is true only if we choose the initial angle of the beam so small that it will always strike a flat side without enclosing a vertex .",
    "this leads to a zero lyapunov exponent , a well - known result .",
    "beams with a finite size will eventually split in both the cases - lorentz and ehrenfest .",
    "however , as we want to capture the positive @xmath77 of the lorentz gas in the limit @xmath78 , we use a finite ( and not infinitesimal ) initial @xmath9 , which inevitably leads to splitting of the beam after a finite time .",
    "the splitting time @xmath74 could be longer if the size of the initial beam is made smaller .",
    "but then there will be more non - diverging collisions before hitting a vertex for the first time .",
    "eqs ( [ eq : circref],[eq : polyref ] ) give the relations between the radii of curvature before and after a collision for lorentz and ehrenfest gases respectively .",
    "in a low density lorentz gas , @xmath79 increases uniformly with time until it falls to about @xmath80 after a collision , after which it increases uniformly again , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stops ] .",
    "the pattern continues as long as the full beam strikes the same scatterers .",
    "as observed above , since the beam can be made to strike the same scatterers up to an arbitrarily large time , the @xmath79@xmath81 graph continues indefinitely .",
    "however , for the ehrenfest gas where the beam may eventually enclose a vertex as the initial angle is not infinitesimal , the condition @xmath82 is violated after a certain number of collisions , causing the @xmath79@xmath81 graph to terminate , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : stops ] .",
    "it is this time that we propose to employ for calculating the time - average in this very definition of the exponent .     ",

    "note that this is only a schematic plot , assuming that all the distance between the scatterers is equal to the mean free path.,height=291 ]    in analogy with the manner in which the lyapunov exponent is calculated for circular scatterers , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) , we define the finite - time exponent for the polygonal scatterers by @xmath83 where with @xmath84 as @xmath85 , the latter expression is obtained after averaging over the angle variable assuming that @xmath86 .    the above expression is similar to the usual expression for the lyapunov exponent , the difference being that we average over a finite time @xmath74 . in general",
    ", @xmath87 will depend on initial conditions , initial angle , and @xmath74 .",
    "however , ehrenfest dynamics is represented in terms of interval - exchange transformations ( iet ) , where intervals correspond to the set of points on the disc from where scattering occurs . from collision - to - collision",
    ", there is a shuffling of the points belonging to the interval on the subsequent discs .",
    "this is the same as the dynamics inside a polygonal billiard @xcite . and",
    "recently , it has been proved that the dynamics induced by iet is weakly mixing @xcite .",
    "since weak mixing implies ergodicity @xcite , initial conditions will not matter over long times .    for further evaluation",
    ", we need a distribution function that takes into account the different lengths of the  teeth \" in the @xmath79@xmath81 graph ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stops ] ) for the ehrenfest gas .",
    "note that a new tooth begins only when @xmath0 and @xmath79 change upon a collision . for a circular scatterer",
    ", they change at each collision and thus the length of each tooth follows the distribution of times taken along the free paths between the scatterers .",
    "however , for the polygonal scatterer , this is not true of every collision .",
    "for the first few collisions , it is possible that the rays do not hit across a vertex , and hence face @xmath88 , keeping @xmath0 constant according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : angle_polygon ] ) .",
    "this aspect changes the value of @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finitedef ] ) , and thus the value of the finite - time lyapunov exponent if the initial alpha is chosen too small ( or , very rarely , if one of the first few free times is much shorter than the average ) . for large @xmath3 and @xmath90 , usually all collisions will be diverging .",
    "the change in finite time lyapunov exponent will therefore occur for very small @xmath49 only .",
    "it is hence crucial to determine the number of collisions on straight edge before encountering a vertex .",
    "a simulation was performed on mathematica using the reflection formula ( [ eq : polyref ] ) , for an ehrenfest gas with a mean free path of @xmath91 in units of the size of the scatterers .",
    "scatterers with @xmath92 sides were chosen , with an initial angle between nearby rays taken as @xmath93 radians .",
    "this resulted in the applicable time scale to be as large as around 100 units ( of @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the velocity of the wind and @xmath20 is the measure of the size of a scatterer ) .",
    "the number of teeth ranged up to 4 .    denoting the probability @xmath96 of hitting the vertex in the first collision",
    ", we note that its approximate value can be calculated from the following equation : @xmath97 it is a measure of @xmath3 , and as @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "we present the results for @xmath100 as calculated for the first tooth in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftlyapunov ] .",
    "if we set the mean free path to 16 times the radius of the scatterer , and the initial angle @xmath101 , then the case of @xmath102 corresponds to a scatterer with 12 sides , and @xmath103 corresponds to a scatterer with around 1200 sides . as the number of sides of the scatterer increases , and hence @xmath104 , the finite - time lyapunov exponent @xmath100 for the ehrenfest gas approaches the usual lyapunov exponent @xmath55 for the lorentz gas .",
    "and the right panel corresponds to @xmath103.,height=124 ]     and the right panel corresponds to @xmath103.,height=124 ]    the time of validity of the exponent can be estimated as follows : the condition to be met is @xmath105 . with @xmath106 , we see that @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "the exponent calculated over a single tooth gives a lower bound on the more accurate exponent calculated by an average over multiple teeth , which will be over a total duration of the order @xmath107 .",
    "the point of this is to show that a strictly non - zero finite - time exponent does exist .",
    "we have verified this in a simulation on mathematica , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : simul ] .",
    "we have studied the case in the theory of dynamical systems where beam splitting leads to non - integrability .",
    "although the lyapunov exponent of such systems is known to be zero , we may define a finite - time exponent which is positive .",
    "this is particularly meaningful for polygonal scatterers with large number of sides .",
    "the reflection law for the case of a regular polygonal scatterer was found .",
    "more precisely , eq . ( [ eq : polyref ] ) holds for any convex scatterer provided the two intersecting segments are replaced by the tangents to the scatterer . having found this , we have argued that for pseudointegrable systems ( which are non - chaotic ) , it is sometimes possible to define a finite - time exponent . in the limit of the number of vertices becoming infinite ( and hence the scatterer becoming circular ) , the exponent found here approaches the lyapunov exponent for the lorentz gas .",
    "thus , on both counts - the collision rule and lyapunov exponent - we have generalized the results .",
    "we have also argued that the finite - time exponent is valid for times of the order @xmath107 .",
    "sm and sc would like to thank the national initiative for undergraduate sciences program under the homi bhabha centre for science education ( hbcse ) for the opportunity and funding , and , bhabha atomic research centre ( barc ) for the facilities for carrying out this work .",
    "the authors also thank the referee for very valuable suggestions .",
    "integrability in the senes of liouville - arnold refers to existence of @xmath108 functionally independent constants of the motion that are in involution and where the vector fields in phase space are smooth everywhere for a system with @xmath108 degrees of freedom .",
    "non - integrability refers to all the behaviours which result from any of the abovementioned conditions to be violated .",
    "thus , defocussing scatterers will result in chaotic dynamics but scatterers with straight edges will give a non - integrable dynamics due to vector fields being singular at vertices @xcite .",
    "for a polygonal scatterer , @xmath7 will be a uniform distributed around @xmath109 with the limits depending on @xmath110 .",
