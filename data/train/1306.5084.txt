    "the natural detector gtf  112 was completely unblinded .",
    "the first step of unblinding gives the possibility to compare the model predictions to the observed number of events in those regions as a consistency check for the model .",
    "table  [ tab : extrapolated_bi ] also lists the predicted and observed number of events in these energy regions for different data sets . in total 13 events",
    "were observed in the unblinded 30  kev window of the _ gold - coax _ data set .",
    "the predictions in this window were 8.6 events from minimum and 10.3 events from maximum model .",

    "for the _ sum - bege _ data set there is a perfect agreement between the observed two events and the expectation of 2.2 events from the model .    if the additional events seen in the 30  kev unblinded window are included to the interpolation the expected bi at @xmath2  increases to 19@xmath3@xmath4  cts/(kev@xmath3kg@xmath3yr )  for the _ gold - coax _ data set",
    ".      given , for the _ gold - coax _ data set , the background prediction of the minimum model of 18.5@xmath310@xmath49 cts/(kev@xmath3kg@xmath3yr )  and the known  17.90  kg@xmath3yr  exposure at the end of phase  i , the sensitivity for the @xmath0 decay half life  @xmath15  was calculated .",

    "the number of events was allowed to fluctuate according to a poisson distribution with expectation given by the number of predicted background events .",
    "the expected lower limit for @xmath15  was estimated by using both , bayesian and frequentist analyses .",
    "in both analyses the signal and background strengths were free parameters .",

    "lower limit @xmath15  @xmath161.9@xmath310@xmath87  yr ( 90% c.l . ) corresponds to the median of the 90% quantile of the profile likelihood . in the bayesian analysis ,",
    "the 90% probability lower limit for @xmath15  was calculated as the median of the 90% quantiles of the posterior marginalized probabilities p@xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the hypothesis that both background and @xmath0 events contribute to the spectrum .",
    "the result is @xmath15  @xmath161.7@xmath310@xmath87  yr ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "the difference in the numerical values from the bayesian and frequentist analysis ( which have conceptually a different meaning ) is mainly due to the behavior of the two approaches in the cases when the number of observed counts is smaller than the background expectation .",
    "the  sensitivity is expected to be about 10% better than calculated from the _ gold - coax _ data set only , because of the extra exposure available in the _ silver - coax _ and _ sum - bege _ data sets .",
    "also the sensitivity might further increase by applying pulse shape discrimination techniques to the _ gold - coax _ , _ silver - coax _ and _ sum - bege _ data sets @xcite .",
    "the background measured by the  experiment has been presented in an energy range between 100 and 7500  kev .",
    "it has been demonstrated that stable low background data taking with the innovative technique of operating bare hpge detectors in a cryogenic liquid is possible over a time period of about 1.5  yr .",
    "more than 20  kg@xmath3yr  of data have been acquired by the  experiment with six enriched coaxial detectors of a total mass of 14.6  kg and with four enriched bege detectors of a total mass of 3.0  kg .",
    "a background model has been developed with the @xmath22=40  kev blinded that allows to predict the bi in this energy range .",
    "the predictions of the models have been tested for consistency on a 30  kev ( 32  kev ) range for the coaxial ( bege ) detectors , while the central @xmath22=10  kev region of interest and @xmath22=8  kev region for the bege detectors around @xmath2  was still blinded .",
    "the model describes the background in an energy range from 570 to 7500  kev well .",
    "the only significant background contributions in   originate from decays of @xmath5k in the lar bath , from @xmath6bi  in the detector assembly , from residual @xmath37rn  dissolved in lar , from @xmath7th  and @xmath8co in the detector assembly , and from surface @xmath9 particles .",
    "the largest contributions come from contaminants located close to the detectors .",
    "several cross checks confirm the validity of the background model .",
    "the 68% credibility intervals of the bi expected due to the minimum and maximum models at @xmath2  of @xmath1ge span the range between 17.6 and 23.8@xmath3@xmath4  cts/(kev@xmath3kg@xmath3yr ) .",
    "this range includes the systematic uncertainty due to different source location assumptions .",
    "predictions for the number of events in the blinded region around @xmath2  have been made .",
    "it could be shown that the expected background is flat in a region of @xmath41  200  kev around @xmath2  and that no significant peak like structures are expected in the blinded energy region . the background model and an interpolation of a fit to data from a 200  kev energy window into the blinded energy window",
    "give compatible results .",
    "the bi interpolated into the region of interest are + ( 1.75@xmath90)@xmath3@xmath47  cts/(kev@xmath3kg@xmath3yr )  for the coaxial detectors and ( 3.6@xmath91)@xmath3@xmath47  cts/(kev@xmath3kg@xmath3yr )  for the bege detectors .",
    "the statistical uncertainty on the bi prediction from interpolation is of the same size as the systematic uncertainty from the choice of the background model .",
    "the bi obtained from interpolation of the spectrum in a 200  kev window around @xmath2 will be used in the @xmath0  analysis of the phase  i data .",
    "given the expected background rate without pulse shape discrimination and assuming no signal , the sensitivity for the _ gold - coax _ data set is @xmath92  yr ( 90% c.l . ) using a profile likelihood fit and @xmath93  yr ( 90% c.i . ) using a bayesian analysis .",
