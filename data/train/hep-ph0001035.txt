    "diffractive phenomena occur in each of untagged , single - tagged and double - tagged photon - photon reactions via the total hadronic @xmath1 cross - section , @xmath2 ; the structure function of the real photon , @xmath3 ( or equivalently the @xmath4 cross - section ) ; and the total hadronic @xmath5 cross - section , @xmath6 respectively .",
    "thus in principle it is possible to study diffraction continuously from the quasi - hadronic regime dominated by non - perturbative physics to the realm of perturbative qcd with either single or double hard scales .",
    "the total hadronic @xmath1 cross - section was measured at lep in the ranges @xmath7  gev  @xcite and @xmath8  gev  @xcite , where @xmath9 is the photon - photon centre - of - mass energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "since the use of different monte carlo models ( pythia  @xcite or phojet  @xcite ) for the unfolding of detector effects leads to significant shifts of the normalisation , the results of the two experiments are compared using only phojet for these corrections ) . ] .",
    "both experiments have measured the high energy rise of the total cross - section typical for hadronic interactions . however a faster rise of the total @xmath10 cross - section with @xmath9 compared to purely hadronic interactions has not been unambiguously observed .",
    "this faster rise is predicted by most models for @xmath1 interactions .    to quantify this effect ,",
    "both experiments have fitted a donnachie - landshoff parametrisation of the form @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the results are @xmath13  ( opal ) and @xmath14  ( l3 ) , where the l3 fit uses only the preliminary data at @xmath15  gev .",
    "the fitted curves are also shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the l3 result implies a significantly faster rise of the total @xmath1 cross - section than in hadron - hadron scattering whereas the opal result is consistent with a typical value of @xmath16 for a soft pomeron .",
    "the results are consistent in the kinematic region where the measurements of both experiments overlap .",
    "some discrepancies seem to exist between the l3 measurements at different @xmath17 , both at low and at high @xmath9 . the data in the range",
    "@xmath18  gev also have large influence on the fitted value of @xmath19 due to the large correlation between the reggeon - term @xmath20 and @xmath19 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the scale for the high energy logarithms .",
    "the result is very sensitive to these parameters , and brodsky et al @xcite showed that changing @xmath21 or @xmath22 alters the predicted cross - section by factors of @xmath23 or @xmath24 respectively in a typical lep experiment .",
    "an additional uncertainty is due to the correct treatment of the production of massive charm quarks .    in an attempt to overcome the scale problem , boonekamp et al @xcite",
    "take a phenomenological approach to estimate the nnlo effects , making use of a fit @xcite to the proton structure function using the qcd dipole picture of bfkl dynamics .",
    "this reduces both the size of the bfkl cross - section and its energy dependence .",
    "[ dt ] shows the preliminary opal measurement of the double - tag e@xmath25e@xmath26 cross - section in the range @xmath27  gev@xmath28  @xcite compared to the lo bfkl calculation and to the ho model of  boonekamp et al .",
    "the cross - section predicted by phojet  @xcite is also shown .",
    "the l3 collaboration has extracted the @xmath29 cross - section using the photon flux for transverse photons ( fig .",
    "[ dt ] )  @xcite .",
    "the qpm part ( box diagram ) has been subtracted ( the unsubtracted cross - section is shown in fig .  [ sd3 ] ) .",
    "the l3 data is compared to a lo bfkl prediction and to the two - gluon exchange cross - section ( here called one - gluon ) based on ref .",
    "@xcite and to a fit of the hard pomeron intercept .",
    "a calculation  @xcite of subleading corrections to the bfkl equation shows that these are significant at lep energies , and with the inclusion of the soft pomeron a reasonable description of the l3 data is obtained .",
    "both experiments observe that the cross - section predicted by phojet , which does not contain bfkl effects , is consistent with the data within the large experimental errors , whereas lo bfkl predictions overestimate the @xmath29 cross - section by a large factor .",
    "however , the large theoretical uncertainties discussed above need to be taken into account .",
    "in the last year difficulties have emerged with the application of the altarelli - parisi equation to the evolution of the proton structure function at small @xmath30 and with the bfkl equation .",
    "these are summarised in  @xcite .",
    "one of the questions is whether intrinsically non - perturbative contributions are involved , even at quite large @xmath31 , because of the intrinsically non - perturbative target .",
    "this complication is in principle avoided in @xmath29 reactions as both are dominated at large @xmath31 by the perturbative part of the photon wave function",
    ". this may be happening at quite modest values of @xmath31 , providing lep with an excellent opportunity to clarify this question .",
