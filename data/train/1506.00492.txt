    "fifty years ago , lipkin , meshkov and glick ( lmg ) proposed in a series of papers an exactly solvable model of interacting fermions in nuclear physics @xcite . in recent years , due to the high controllability of trapped cold atomic and ionic systems , the model found applications in different areas of physics such as bose ",
    "einstein condensates @xcite , ion traps @xcite , in cavities @xcite .",
    "the model has also been used to investigate quantum phase transitions @xcite and their relations with bipartite entanglement @xcite,@xcite . despite the fact that it has been proved that the model is integrable through the bethe ansatz method @xcite  and",
    "some properties of the system can be extracted , in principle , this method does not yield an essential simplification for calculating the spectral properties of large systems . among the theoretical methods applied to the lmg model were the wkb method @xcite , the instanton technique @xcite , and a mapping onto a schrdinger particle problem @xcite .",
    "these methods are however only applicable in the asymptotic limit of large numbers of particles .    for many applications , e.g. the creation of many - particle entanglement by adiabatic ground - state transitions , it is important to establish a lower bound of the gap between the ground state and the rest of the spectrum . for the finite number of spins it has been shown @xcite , @xcite that the antiferromagnetic supersymmetric lmg model ( ground state with zero energy and doubly degenerate excited states in the energy spectrum ) is gapped for an arbitrary even number of particles .",
    "in this paper we present more detailed quantitative studies of the energy spectrum of this model .",
    "in particular , we find a lower bound for the spectral gap which does not depend on the number of particles .",
    "the latter result might sound paradoxical , because ,  it is commonly believed that the gap in the spectrum of spin-@xmath0 hamiltonians decreases with increasing the number of particles . for _ local hamiltonians _ in one spatial dimension with spin-@xmath0  it is an exact statement of the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem @xcite . in our model , however , the locality condition is violated and therefore this theorem is not applicable .",
    "we begin considering the lmg model .",
    "let us consider an even number @xmath1 of spin-@xmath0 particles interacting through a nonlinear coupling of the collective spin @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the @xmath4 th component of the single - particle spin .",
    "the interaction is assumed to be of second order in the total spin .",
    "the lmg hamiltonian takes the following form @xmath5 for the interested reader about the lmg model we refer to the review article @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we consider only the maximum symmetric sector of the total hilbert space , i.e. the total spin is equal @xmath6 the parameters @xmath7 are assumed to be positive constants . at the point",
    "where @xmath8 , depending on the sign of the @xmath9 the ground state is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic for @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . in the following we consider only the antiferromagnetic case .",
    "we note that by the rotation  @xmath12 the hamiltonian ( [ lmg_hamiltonian ] ) can be transformed into the form @xmath13  and therefore , we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath14 .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite the spectrum of the antiferromagnetic lmg model becomes  supersymmetric at the point  @xmath15 .",
    "the analysis of the spectrum of the hamiltonian operator ( [ lmg_hamiltonian ] ) can be greatly simplified by introducing new parameters,@xmath16 where @xmath17 and making use of the expression for a hyperbolic rotation about the @xmath18 -axis with the parameter @xmath19 @xmath20 thanks to this transformation , the hamiltonian can be factorized as follows@xmath21@xmath22 we set @xmath23 throughout .",
    "we see that for an arbitrary value of @xmath19 all eigenvalues @xmath24 of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianfacrorization ] ) satisfy @xmath25 ,  and in addition to that for even number @xmath1 of spin-@xmath0 , i.e. integer angular momentum @xmath26 , there is ground state with @xmath27 @xmath28 with @xmath29 being legendre polynomials ( for more details , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ spectrum ] shows the typical spectra  for @xmath30 and @xmath31 depending on anisotropy parameter @xmath19 .",
    "as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonianfacrorization ] ) the spectrum of the hamiltonian  is symmetric with respect to the @xmath19 .",
    "spectrum.eps    a glance at the spectrum of the hamiltonian as a function of @xmath19 reveals ( see fig.[spectrum ] ) that the spectrum consists of pairwise degenerate levels and a nondegenerate single state ( the ground state ) which signals the presence of a supersymmetry .",
    "in addition to that , we observe ( fig.[gap ] ) that the gap does not close for large values @xmath1 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianfacrorization ] ) has , for @xmath32 , no obvious symmetries other than the rotational symmetry around the @xmath18-axis by @xmath33 and the spin - flip symmetry .",
    "it is clear that those symmetries can not be responsible for this kind of spectrum .",
    "now let us move on to an explanation of these observations .",
    "we begin by the schwinger - boson representation of the angular momentum operators in terms of two bosonic operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath36 for our purposes it is convenient to use another unitarily equivalent form of the hamiltonian ( [ lmg_hamiltonian ] ) , namely @xmath37 this hamiltonian can be transformed into the following block diagonal form    gap.eps    @xmath38{cc}\\mathbf{h}_{even } & \\mathbf{0}\\\\ \\mathbf{0 } & \\mathbf{h}_{odd}\\end{array } \\right ]   \\label{decomposition_even_odd}\\ ] ]    by grouping together its elements with even and odd  bosomic excitations . in accordance with our partition @xmath39 is a matrix with the dimension @xmath40 .",
    "it acts on states with even number of bosons such as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an even number .",
    "and @xmath43 has @xmath44 dimension and acts on states with odd number of bosons such as @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an odd number .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ susy44 ] ) for @xmath48 particles has dimension @xmath49 . the susy spectrum of the system must be twofold degenerate except for ground state i.e. the total number of states must be an odd number .",
    "therefore we can see immediately that for an odd number  of particles the susy should be broken .",
    "the decomposition ( [ decomposition_even_odd ] ) allows us to introduce a fermionic  number @xmath50 : if @xmath51 one has even excitations and @xmath52 odd excitations . at the susy point @xmath53",
    "one can introduce the following two off - diagonal ( in the basis of odd and even bosonic excitations ) operators ( supercharges)@xmath54{cc}\\underset{\\left (   n+1\\right )   \\times\\left (   n+1\\right ) } { \\underbrace{\\mathbf{0 } } } & j_{x}\\cosh\\gamma - ij_{y}\\sinh\\gamma\\\\ j_{x}\\cosh\\gamma+ij_{y}\\sinh\\gamma & \\underset{n\\times n}{\\underbrace{\\mathbf{0}}}\\end{array } \\right ]   , \\label{supercharge1}\\]]@xmath55{cc}\\underset{\\left (   n+1\\right )   \\times\\left (   n+1\\right ) } { \\underbrace{\\mathbf{0 } } } & -j_{y}\\sinh\\gamma - ij_{x}\\cosh\\gamma\\\\ -j_{y}\\sinh\\gamma+ij_{x}\\cosh\\gamma & \\underset{\\left (   n+1\\right ) \\times\\left (   n+1\\right )   } { \\underbrace{\\mathbf{0}}}\\end{array } \\right ]   .\\label{supercharge2}\\ ] ] one can check easily that the lmg hamiltonian at the susy point can be represented as square of @xmath56 namely @xmath57 and in addition to that @xmath58 and @xmath59 anticommute with each other@xmath60 combining relations ( [ susy1 ] ) and ( [ susy2 ] ) in the form @xcite@xmath61    &   = 0,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we arrive at a simple superalgebra , i.e. , an algebra which includes both commutation and anticommutation relations .    the above discussion can be made more concrete by looking at the case when @xmath62 ( @xmath30 ) . in this case ,  the lmg hamiltonian ( [ susy44 ] ) after the renumbering states with even and odd excitations takes the following block diagonal form@xmath38{ccccc}e^{-2\\gamma } & \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2 } } & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2 } } & 3\\cosh2\\gamma & \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2 } } & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2 } } & e^{2\\gamma } & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2}\\left (   5\\cosh2\\gamma+\\sinh2\\gamma\\right )   & \\frac { 3}{2}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{3}{2 } & \\frac{1}{2}\\left (   5\\cosh2\\gamma-\\sinh 2\\gamma\\right ) \\end{array } \\right ]   .\\ ] ] the corresponding supercharges are@xmath63{ccccc}0 & 0 & 0 & e^{-\\gamma } & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}e^{\\gamma } & \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}e^{-\\gamma}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & e^{\\gamma}\\\\ e^{-\\gamma } & \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}e^{\\gamma } & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}e^{-\\gamma } & e^{\\gamma } & 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ]   , \\ ] ] and@xmath64{ccccc}0 & 0 & 0 & -e^{-\\gamma } & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}e^{\\gamma } & -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}e^{-\\gamma}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -e^{\\gamma}\\\\ e^{-\\gamma } & \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}e^{\\gamma } & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}e^{-\\gamma } & e^{\\gamma } & 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ]   .\\ ] ] a simple matrix calculation shows that these matrices satisfy the susy algebra ( [ susy33 ] ) .",
    "because the hamiltonian is @xmath65 its eigenvalues can not be negative .",
    "any states with zero energies are therefore ground states , and must be annihilated by both @xmath58 and @xmath59 . for the excited states , however , in general ,",
    "no further information can be gotten from the susy algebra ( [ susy33 ] ) , besides that they are two - fold degenerate @xcite .    in the following",
    "we show that by using the representation ( [ hamiltonianfacrorization ] ) the degeneracy and an estimation for the gap can be obtained through direct calculations .",
    "it is easy to see from the eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonianfacrorization ] ) that the lmg hamiltonian is similar to the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath66@xmath67 from this form , one can see clearly that this hamiltonian has a null state @xmath68 ( @xmath69 for an integer angular momentum ) .",
    "the second term gives rise to a coupling between @xmath70 and @xmath71 states .",
    "the operator @xmath72 can be represented as a block matrix in a basis where @xmath73 is diagonal , @xmath74{ccc}h_{- } & 0 & 0\\\\ \\left\\langle a\\right\\vert   & 0 & \\left\\langle a\\right\\vert \\\\ 0 & 0 & h_{+}\\end{array } \\right )   , \\label{blockform22}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are permutation equivalent real  @xmath77 matrices , i.e. they have the same spectrum , @xmath78 is the transposed vector which connects subspace with negative and positive values of the magnetic quantum numbers . for our purposes , the generic form of @xmath78 is not relevant .",
