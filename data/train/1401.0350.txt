    "determining the pseudo - effective cone , the closure @xmath8 of the cone of effective divisor classes on a projective variety @xmath9 , is a familiar and challenging problem in geometry . a related structure , defined when the picard group @xmath10 is finitely generated , is the cox ring , or total coordinate ring @xcite : @xmath11 this ring is graded by @xmath10 , and the support for this grading is the monoid of effective divisor classes , sometimes denoted @xmath12 , which forms a collection of distinguished lattice points in the effective cone . given a set of generators for @xmath13 , their classes in @xmath10 yield a set of generators for @xmath12 , and the limits of the rays spanned by these classes in @xmath14 generate @xmath15 .",
    "however , @xmath13 need not be finitely generated , even if @xmath15 or @xmath12 is , so computing a presentation of the cox ring is often not a plausible way to study effective divisor classes . moreover , the list of generators one obtains ( whether finite or not ) from generators of the cox ring can be massively redundant . when @xmath10 is finitely generated and torsion - free , there is a unique minimal generating set for @xmath12 which is typically quite geometrically meaningful .",
    "for instance , if @xmath9 is a del pezzo surface then the minimal generators for @xmath12 are the classes of the @xmath16-curves and this provides a bridge to many beautiful areas of representation theory and combinatorics .    the cox ring , effective cone , and effective monoid",
    "are usually studied over the complex numbers , since that is where the strongest geometric tools are applicable @xcite .",
    "however , they may be defined more generally if @xmath9 is defined over other rings and can encode important arithmetic information in such cases .    in this paper",
    "we develop a systematic framework for studying the cox ring and monoid of effective divisor classes for the moduli space @xmath17 of @xmath4-pointed stable rational curves , valid over any ring @xmath1 .",
    "we crucially rely on the kapranov - hassett presentation of @xmath17 over @xmath18 as an iterated blow - up of @xmath19 along linear subspaces @xcite , which in turn leads to a description , over the integers , of @xmath20 as a subring of invariants of a @xmath21-graded polynomial ring @xcite . as there are no torsion issues , and picard groups",
    "are canonically identified upon base change , there is no choice of isomorphism class of universal torus torsor and the cox ring is well - defined and may be studied over @xmath1 via its presentation over @xmath22 .",
    "questions about @xmath20 date back to the introduction of the notion of a cox ring @xcite , and studying the collection of effective divisors in @xmath17 has been central to a burgeoning industry for a myriad of moduli spaces @xcite .",
    "it has very recently been shown that @xmath20 is not finitely generated when @xmath23 and @xmath1 is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero @xcite .",
    "however , finite generation of @xmath24 and @xmath25 remains an open question for all @xmath26 . rather than focusing on finite generation , however , we turn to questions such as the following :    1 .   how do the cox ring and effective divisor classes depend on the base ring @xmath1 ?",
    "2 .   is the first lattice point of every ray of the effective cone an effective divisor class ?",
    "3 .   does a minimal generating set for the cox ring yield one for the effective monoid or cone ?",
    "4 .   are there classes spanning rays outside the previously known subcone of the effective cone ? 5 .",
    "what other geometric structures are related to the minimal generators of these objects ?",
    "we find that the answer to _ all _ of these questions changes drastically when passing from @xmath27 to @xmath26 .",
    "the following gives a flavor of our findings , all of which are provided by explicit examples .",
    "question ( 5 ) is addressed in  [ sec : precise ] , where detailed versions of these and other results are presented .",

    ".   there are rays in @xmath29 that are effective in all characteristics , yet their first lattice point is effective if and only if @xmath30 ; 2 .",
    "the monoid @xmath25 is not generated by the divisor classes spanning extremal rays of @xmath24 , hence the ring @xmath20 is not generated by the sections of such divisor classes , when @xmath31 .",
    "3 .   there are effective rays outside the cone of boundary and hypertree divisors , thereby disproving a conjecture of castravet and tevelev @xcite .",
    "[ rem : opie ] while preparing this preprint we were informed that opie had simultaneously constructed counterexamples to the hypertree conjecture @xcite .",
    "we show that , for @xmath7 , there are extremal rays outside the cone generated by boundary , hypertree , and opie s divisors .    by contrast , for @xmath27 the cox ring has the same set of minimal generators for any field , the classes of these generators form a minimal generating set for the effective monoid , and these classes are the first lattice points of each extremal ray of the effective cone ( see  [ sec : previous ] ) .",
    "for @xmath32 these generators are all boundary divisors . for",
    "@xmath5 there are non - boundary generators , and they are all given , in terms of kapranov s blow - up construction @xmath0 , as the strict transform of certain quadric hypersurfaces .",
    "we provide a complete classification of all minimal generators of @xmath25 corresponding to quadric hypersurfaces , for any @xmath4 ; this provides a rich enough supply of divisor classes to construct all the examples described in theorem [ thm : intromain ] .",
    "the basis of our framework is a result in @xcite that @xmath20 is isomorphic , over @xmath18 , to the ring of @xmath33-invariants for an action on a polynomial ring .",
    "this polynomial ring is the cox ring of a toric variety , call it @xmath34 , with the same picard group as @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath33-action on @xmath35 is induced by one on the universal torus torsor over @xmath34 , an open subset of affine space , rather than an action on @xmath34 itself .",
    "since the grading by this common picard group on the two cox rings is compatible , a divisor class on @xmath17 is effective if and only if the corresponding class on @xmath34 admits a @xmath33-invariant section .",
    "we encode homogeneous polynomials in @xmath35 by a singular simplicial complex whose simplices are in bijection with the terms of the polynomial and are decorated with the corresponding coefficients .",
    "invariance under the @xmath33-action then translates into a zero - tension condition that for each face of a simplex in the complex , the sum of @xmath1-weights of simplices containing that face is zero .",
    "as we shall see , this perspective of `` balanced complexes '' yields a powerful new perspective on the cox ring @xmath20 and effective monoid @xmath25 , and , like the case of @xmath16-curves on a del pezzo surface , it ties the geometry of effective divisors in @xmath17 to many beautiful classical constructions , such as triangulations of the sphere and other closed manifolds .",
    "we list several open questions and areas of further study arising from this perspective in  [ sec : future ] .      throughout this paper",
    "we fix an isomorphism @xmath0 , i.e. , a choice of @xmath36-class .",
    "this isomorphism was originally provided by kapranov over @xmath37 @xcite , but work of hassett extends it to be defined over @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this yields a @xmath22-grading on @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; indeed , by the _",
    "degree _ of a divisor or its class we shall mean the image under the map @xmath38 induced by the above blow - up presentation . thus , the degree of an effective divisor is zero if it is a union of exceptional divisors and it is simply the degree of its image as a hypersurface in @xmath39 otherwise .",
    "the first conjecture concerning effective divisors in @xmath17 was given by fulton , although formally stated by keel and mckernan in @xcite .",
    "it asserts that @xmath24 is spanned by the classes of boundary divisors , extending the del pezzo situation of @xmath40 and inspired by the geometry of toric varieties where boundary strata do indeed span all effective classes .",
    "put another way , this conjecture says that the effective cone is generated by classes of degree at most one . however , keel and vermeire simultaneously found degree two counterexamples for @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "hassett and tschinkel , with the help of computer calculation , verified that for @xmath5 the keel - vermeire classes , together with the boundary classes , do in fact span the entire effective cone @xcite .",
    "the question remained of whether the unique ( up to scalar ) sections of these divisor classes generate @xmath41 . here",
    "castravet performed a comprehensive analysis of this particular case and found a positive answer to this question @xcite .",
    "this implies that the effective monoid @xmath42 is also minimally generated by the boundary and keel - vermeire classes , so essentially everything is known here and attention now turns to @xmath43 .",
    "many experts believed the keel - vermeire classes in @xmath5 must be part of a more general construction valid for all @xmath4 , yet this vast generalization proved rather elusive .",
    "a breakthrough was made in 2009 when castravet and tevelev found a construction ( summarized in ",
    "[ sec : ctbackground ] ) that yields all keel - vermeire classes in @xmath5 and a huge number of new extremal rays for @xmath26 .",
    "they conjectured that the boundary classes together with these so - called hypertree divisor classes span @xmath24 for all @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "additionally , they raised the question ( and called it a `` pipe dream '' ) of whether , as with @xmath5 , it is always the case that the cox ring is generated by sections of divisor classes spanning extremal rays of the effective cone .",
    "one could weaken this dream slightly and ask for the effective monoid @xmath25 to be generated by classes lying along extremal rays . as we shall see below",
    ", these dreams fail for all @xmath26 , as does the hypertree conjecture ( see also remark [ rem : opie ] concerning opie s exciting paper @xcite ) .    along with the remarkable recent result of castravet and tevelev",
    "that @xmath20 is not finitely generated for @xmath23 @xcite , or in other words , that hu and keel s dream for @xmath17 is also false @xcite , we are left once again in a quandary : one hopes that there is some order to the seemingly chaotic and unwieldy collection of effective divisors and divisor classes on @xmath17 , yet the challenge is to find a structure that best describes it and reveals how truly complex it is .      for us ,",
    "a ( possibly singular ) @xmath44-simplex is a multiset of cardinality @xmath45 , and a pure - dimensional simplicial complex of dimension @xmath44 , or `` @xmath44-complex '' , with vertex set @xmath46 : = \\{1,\\ldots , n-1\\}$ ] is any set of @xmath44-simplices with entries in @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "thus , a 1-complex is a graph with loops allowed but multiple edges disallowed . for a multiset @xmath47 ,",
    "the number of times @xmath48 occurs is its multiplicity , denoted @xmath49 .",
    "we call a complex `` non - singular '' if every element of every simplex in it has multiplicity at most one .    fix a ring @xmath1 and consider @xmath17 relative to @xmath50 .",
    "a weighted complex is an assignment of a nonzero element of @xmath1 to each simplex in a complex , and a weighted complex is `` balanced '' if , for each face , the sum of the weights of simplices containing it is zero ( see definition [ def : balanced ] for details ) .",
    "it is `` balanceable '' if there exists a collection of elements of @xmath3 satisfying this property . for any @xmath44-complex @xmath51 on @xmath46 $ ]",
    "we define a degree @xmath45 divisor class @xmath52 as follows : @xmath53 here @xmath54 $ ] satisfies @xmath55 and @xmath56 denotes the corresponding exceptional divisor .",
    "the following result is where we crucially use the identification in @xcite ( and summarized in ",
    "[ sec : coxinvar ] ) of @xmath20 with an explicit ring of @xmath33-invariants :    [ thm : introcorresp ] for any @xmath57 and @xmath58 , there is a natural bijection between degree @xmath45 multi - homogeneous elements of @xmath20 , not divisible by any exceptional divisor section , and balanced @xmath44-complexes on @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "all balancings on a complex @xmath51 correspond to elements with class @xmath52 .",
    "we call a complex `` minimal '' if it is balanceable yet no proper subcomplex is balanceable . for a @xmath59-complex @xmath60 and a @xmath61-complex @xmath62 ,",
    "their product is the @xmath63-complex @xmath64 with simplices @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "recall that the monoid @xmath25 of effective divisor classes has a unique collection of minimal generators ( cf .",
    ", remark [ rem : monirr ] ) .",
    "we can now state our main results on complexes and divisor classes :    fix integers @xmath67 as above .    1 .",
    "let @xmath68 be a class such that @xmath69 is not effective for any @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath71 is effective if and only if there is a balanceable complex @xmath51 with @xmath72 .",

    "[ sec : complexes ] .",
    "turning now to 1-complexes ( i.e. , graphs ) and their corresponding degree two divisor classes ( i.e. , strict transforms of quadric hypersurfaces ) we have the following ( see  [ sec : deg2 ] ) :    fix a base field @xmath28 .",

    "moreover , the ray spanned by this class lies outside the cone of boundary and hypertree divisors ( corollary [ cor : nequalsseven ] ) , so it yields an @xmath89 counterexample to the castravet - tevelev conjecture and its pull - backs along the forgetful morphisms thus yield counterexamples for all @xmath4 .",
