    "a fundamental property of wireless signal transmissions is that their power rapidly decays over distance . in particular , in free space we know from the friis equation that over a distance @xmath6 the received signal power @xmath7 is given in terms of the transmit power @xmath8 as @xmath9 for a wavelength @xmath10 and antenna transmit and receive gains @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in terrestrial environments , propagation is much more complex to characterize due to ground reflections , scattering , blocking / shadowing , and other physical features . since the number of possible realizations of propagation environments is infinite , simplified models stemming from the friis equation are typically adopted that have at least some measure of empirical support .",
    "a nearly universal characteristic of such models is that the distance dependence is generalized to @xmath13 , with the path loss exponent @xmath2 being a parameter that can be roughly fit to the environment . in decibel terms , this gives a form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a catch - all constant that gives the path loss ( in db ) at a distance @xmath16 .",
    "for example , in the friis equation , @xmath17 .",
    "hence the slope of the path loss ( in db ) is constant and is determined only by @xmath2 in such a model , which we will term a _",
    "standard path loss model_.      although the standard path loss model has a great deal of history , and is the basis for most existing cellular network theory , analysis , simulation and design , it is also known to lead to unrealistic results in some special cases @xcite .",
    "besides , the standard path loss model does not accurately capture the dependence of the path loss exponent @xmath2 on the link distance in many important situations .",
    "we now enumerate a few of these as examples , along with the possible consequences to future cellular network optimization and design .",
    "* the two - ray model . * even a very simple two - ray model with one direct path and one ground - reflected path results in a pronounced dual slope path loss behavior @xcite .",
    "in particular , with transmit and receive antenna heights of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , below a critical distance @xmath20 the path loss exponent is @xmath21 , while above this distance it changes to @xmath22 . for a plausible values",
    "@xmath23  m , @xmath24  m , and a carrier frequency @xmath25 ghz , we have @xmath26  m as a rough threshold .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that there is a massive difference between @xmath27 and @xmath28 for most reasonable values of @xmath6 , and that splitting the difference by using @xmath29 results in large errors in both regimes .    *",
    "dense or clustered networks . *",
    "wireless networks are rapidly increasing in density , and in doing so are becoming ever more irregular @xcite .",
    "this causes increasing variations in the link distances and the number of appreciable interferers , and makes a `` one size fits all '' path loss model ever more dubious .",
    "for example , a cellular user equipment ( ue ) might connect with its closest macrocell ( or microcell ) that is beyond the critical distance , while experiencing interference from nearby closed access femtocells that are within the critical distance but can not be connected to @xcite .",
    "in such a case the sinr would be greatly over - estimated with a standard path loss model , and the gain from interference avoidance or cancellation techniques greatly underestimated . or if a nearby picocell was connected to , while interference mostly originated from more distant bss , the sinr would be greatly underestimated .",
    "in general , standard path loss models may not paint an accurate picture of what happens as networks densify , which is a key theme that we explore in this paper",

    "the intriguing possibility of using millimeter waves ",
    "@xmath30 mm , _ i.e.,_carrier frequencies of @xmath31 to @xmath32 ghz  for cellular communication makes the revisitation of propagation models particularly urgent @xcite . a key feature of millimeter wave systems is their sensitivity to blocking @xcite .",
    "one recently proposed model with considerable empirical support is to use one path loss exponent @xmath33 for line of sight ( los ) links and another @xmath34 for non line of sight ( nlos ) links @xcite .",
    "statistically , los links are shorter than nlos links , and a critical distance @xmath35 can be used to approximate the two regimes @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath35 is an environmentally dependent random variable , but it could be approximated by the mean los distance .",
    "for example , in urban parts of new york city and chicago , this method will lead to @xmath36  m @xcite , whereas in environments with less blocking @xmath35 would increase .",
    "although such approximations require considerable further investigation , generalizing to at least a dual - slope model appears essential for millimeter wave cellular systems .",
    "the above examples make clear that a dual ( or more ) slope path loss model is highly desirable for analysis . and",
    "indeed , such a model is very close to many scenarios in the winner ii path loss model adopted for 3gpp - lte standardization @xcite and is well - supported by many measurements see , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "a more detailed comparison between the dual ( or more ) slope path loss models and the models in the standardization activities can be found in @xcite .",
    "the overall contribution of this paper is to analyze the coverage probability ( sinr distribution ) and potential throughput of a downlink cellular network under multi - slope path loss models , with a focus on the dual - slope model .",
    "this can largely be viewed as a generalization of @xcite which used the standard path loss model and derived fairly simple closed form solutions particularly for the case of @xmath22 .",
    "one notable observation from @xcite was that the coverage probability ( sinr ) can only increase with bs density , and does not depend on the bs density once it is sufficiently large ( thus rendering noise negligible compared to interference ) .",
    "we term this property _ sinr invariance _ , and will see that it does not even approximately hold with a dual - slope model .",
    "although the results for a multi - slope path loss model are predictably more complicated than with the standard path loss model , in various limiting cases several crisp statements can be made .",
    "below , we summarize the main contributions of this paper :    * we derive numerically tractable integral - form expressions as well as tight closed - form estimates for the coverage probability ( sinrdistribution ) in cellular networks with multi - slope path loss functions and poisson distributed bss . * focusing on the dual - slope case , we prove that network sir decreases with increasing network density .",
    "since snr always increases with network densification , the spectral efficiency is a non - monotonic function of network density , rendering an ( finite ) optimal density that maximizes the coverage probability , _ i.e.,_the probability of meeting a particular @xmath37 target .",
    "these results stand in sharp contrast to the sinr invariance observed under the standard path loss model @xcite .",
    "* however , the network potential throughput still ( asymptotically ) _ linearly _ scales with network density @xmath38 if the near - field path loss exponent @xmath3 is larger than 2 .",
    "the scaling rate becomes @xmath39 , _",
    "i.e.,_sublinear , for @xmath40 .",
    "* on the other hand , with ultra - densification , _",
    "i.e.,_the network density @xmath38 goes to infinity , the potential throughput always scales unboundedly if @xmath41 , despite the fact that the coverage probability goes to zero in the limit when @xmath42 .",
    "phase - transition _ happens at @xmath43 : if @xmath44 , ultra - densification ( @xmath45 ) always leads ultimately to zero throughput .",
    "* the above results are shown to generalize to multi - slope path loss functions , with an arbitrary number of increasing path loss exponents .      in the rest of the paper",

    "we assume the bs distribution is governed by a marked poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath47 , where the ground process @xmath48 is a homogeneous ppp with intensity @xmath38 and @xmath49 is the ( power ) fading gain from the bs at @xmath50 to the typical user @xmath46 . for simplicity but without loss of generality , we assume that all bss transmit with unit power and let @xmath51 denote the path loss function .",

    "however , as we noted at the outset , this model has severe limitations , and several motivating examples lead us to consider a dual - slope path loss function .",

    "<S> existing cellular network analyses , and even simulations , typically use the standard path loss model where received power decays like @xmath0 over a distance @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this standard path loss model is quite idealized , and in most scenarios the path loss exponent @xmath2 is itself a function of @xmath1 , typically an increasing one . </S>",
    "<S> enforcing a single path loss exponent can lead to orders of magnitude differences in average received and interference powers versus the true values . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study _ multi - slope _ path loss models , where different distance ranges are subject to different path loss exponents . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the dual - slope path loss function , which is a piece - wise power law and continuous and accurately approximates many practical scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the distributions of sir , snr , and finally sinr before finding the potential throughput scaling , which provides insight on the observed cell - splitting rate gain . </S>",
    "<S> the exact mathematical results show that the sir monotonically decreases with network density , while the converse is true for snr , and thus the network coverage probability in terms of sinr is maximized at some finite density . with ultra - densification </S>",
    "<S> ( network density goes to infinity ) , there exists a _ phase transition _ in the near - field path loss exponent @xmath3 : if @xmath4 unbounded potential throughput can be achieved asymptotically ; if @xmath5 , ultra - densification leads in the extreme case to zero throughput . </S>"
