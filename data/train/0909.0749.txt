    "the underlying geometry is assumed to be that of a friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) geometry , and in matching the cosmological observables that derive from such a geometry , we have been led to the conclusion over the past decade that the present  day universe is dominated by a cosmological constant or other fluid  like `` dark energy '' with an equation of state , @xmath4 , which violates the strong energy condition .",

    "i will begin by briefly reviewing the two  scale `` fractal bubble model '' @xcite which i am hereby renaming the `` timescape model '' @xcite , concentrating on the operational interpretation of observations .",
    "the model is constructed by identifying the observed scales most relevant to the observed present epoch inhomogeneous structure as being negatively curved _ voids _ and spatially flat _ walls _ , which surround bound structures .    since",
    "galaxies and galaxy clusters formed from perturbations which were greater than critical density , then given an observable universe which on average has negative ricci scalar curvature , we have a natural separation between walls and voids .",
    "as there is assumed to be a gradient in spatial curvature , it is assumed we can always enclose the bound structures which formed from over - critical perturbations within regions which are spatially flat on average , and marginally expanding at the boundary .",
    "these boundaries are called _ finite infinity _",
    "regions @xcite , with local average metric ^2=-^2+^2 ( ) .",
    "[ wgeom]the walls constitute the union of such finite infinity regions .",
    "observationally they would correspond to all extended structures that contain galaxy clusters , namely sheets , filaments and knots @xcite .",
    "voids of a characteristic diameter @xmath15 mpc are observed to fill 4050% of the universe at the present epoch @xcite .",
    "in addition there are numerous minivoids , which have been well  studied in the local volume @xcite .",
    "together voids of all sizes appear to dominate the volume of the present epoch universe , the exact volume fraction depending on the empirical definition of a void in terms of some particular negative density contrast . in the two  scale approximation of refs .",
    "@xcite both the dominant voids and minivoids are assumed to be characterized by the same negatively spatial curvature scale , with a metric at the void centres being given by ^2=-^2+^2()[vgeom ]    we construct an average over the disjoint union of wall and void regions over the entire present horizon volume @xmath16 , where ^3=^3+^3,[bav]@xmath17 and @xmath18 being the respective initial void and wall volume fractions at last scattering .",
    "the finite infinity scale only becomes operationally defined once regions start collapsing and structure forms .",
    "thus at last scattering a different interpretation of the wall and void components in ( [ bav ] ) is required . at this epoch",
    "the wall fraction @xmath19 is understood as that fraction of the present horizon volume which comprises perturbations whose combined mean density is the same as the mean density of the statistical ensemble of perturbations , including those beyond the horizon .",
    "the void fraction , @xmath20 , is understood to be that ( small ) fraction of the present horizon volume in underdense perturbations which was not compensated by overdense perturbations at last scattering .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite ( [ bav ] ) as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the _ wall volume fraction _ and @xmath23 is the _ void volume fraction_.      in order to physically identify observables we must specify what is to be identified as a `` particle '' of dust .",
    "the question of what constitutes a particle of dust is not directly addressed in buchert s scheme , although perhaps implicitly many researchers think of galaxies as being the particles of dust , as historically this is the way the matter is treated in the flrw model .",
    "however , galaxies evolve considerably over time and are not homogeneously distributed at the present epoch . thus if we wish to follow cosmic evolution from the epoch of last scattering to the present , with no assumptions about homogeneity , then we must coarse grain the dust on scales over which mass flows can be neglected , so that each dust particle remains of a roughly fixed mass , even if the mass differs somewhat from particle to particle .    here",
    "we take a `` dust particle '' to be of at least the scale of statistical homogeneity , 100@xmath14 mpc or somewhat larger @xcite .",
    "the _ scale of statistical homogeneity _ is taken to refer to a scale volume within which the structure of voids and walls is roughly similar , if such a box is chosen at random on a spatial slice in the observable universe at late epochs .",
    "it is important to realise such volumes will _ not _ have the same density . rather they will have a density which is distributed about a mean with a standard deviation of order several percent , by an argument that follows from eq .",
    "( [ est ] ) below .",
    "we must stress that the universe is not considered to be a flrw model , and our terminology of a `` scale of statistical homogeneity '' is not the same as in a flrw model .",
    "a scale of homogeneity , in its sense in the flrw model , is not assumed to exist .",
    "the principal difference is that in a flrw model the density of the observable universe , sampled over the present horizon volume , is assumed to be the mean density of the ensemble from which our observable horizon volume was drawn . in the flrw case the standard deviation of the density of spatial volumes would decrease to zero as one sampled ever larger volumes greater than the homogeneity scale , as is the case for any stationary stochastic process @xcite",
    "such a state of affairs can not be expected to prevail , however , given cosmic variance and an initial spectrum of density contrasts of all possible length scales which are nested within each other , which is the expectation from primordial inflation .",
    "given cosmic variance , then as one samples larger and larger volumes that become comparable with the horizon volume , one is dealing with fewer and fewer individual fluctuations rather than a statistical ensemble .",
    "the assumption in the  scenario is that the present horizon volume is underdense relative to the ensemble mean density , which at last  scattering is extremely close to critical .",
    "the fact that it does nonetheless make sense to think of a `` scale of statistical homogeneity '' as above , however , is a simple consequence of the fact that although the density perturbations have all possible length scales , the magnitude of these contrasts was strongly bounded at the time of last scattering . in other words , given a universe which was close to homogeneous at last scattering , it can only evolve so far from homogeneity within the finite age of the universe .",
    "the relevant scale for a cutoff to the `` scale of statistical homogeneity '' is scale of the largest acoustic wave in the plasma at last scattering  of order 110@xmath14 mpc .",
    "the simple reason for such a cutoff , is that below this scale initial density contrasts may be amplified by acoustic waves in the plasma , so that rather than having initial density contrasts of say @xmath24 in nonbaryonic dark matter , the initial density contrasts will be somewhat larger .",
    "the second acoustic peak in the cmb anisotropy spectrum ",
    "i.e. , the first refraction peak  for example , will amplify the density contrast of underdense regions , and may therefore be the feature of the primordial spectrum responsible for the fact that the dominant void fraction is associated to a specific scale @xmath15 mpc @xcite .",
    "given that some initial density perturbations are amplified below the acoustic scale , and that the cmb anisotropy spectrum is fairly flat at long wavelengths , the acoustic scale provides a cutoff analogous the cutoff between the nonlinear and linear regimes of structure formation , although here there is no single global flrw model about which such regimes linear are defined @xcite .",
    "below the scale of statistical homogeneity we will typically find density contrasts @xmath25 which characterize the nonlinear regime , as is the observed case for @xmath15 mpc diameter voids @xcite . above the acoustic scale",
    ", we can be sure that the perturbations at last scattering have very similar amplitudes as a function of scale .",
    "although the perturbations in the photon  baryon plasma have contrasts @xmath26 at this epoch , the density contrast in nonbaryonic dark matter is expected to be somewhat larger ; e.g. , of order @xmath24@xmath27 , depending on one s dark matter model .",
    "the standard deviation of the density of cells on scales larger than the scale of statistical homogeneity can be estimated crudely by assuming that such cells each evolve as an independent friedmann universe from a smooth perturbation at the epoch of last scattering .",
    "this approximation is justified since the relevant scale is the one over which there are no appreciable average mass flows from one dust cell to another .",
    "we assume that the backreaction contributions do not dominate the volume  average evolution , and make our rough estimate from the friedmann equation with pressureless dust only , for which @xmath28\\ ] ] this leads to a present epoch density contrast 0(h)^2_t(1+z)^2 , [ est]where the density contrast is relative to the critical density , so that @xmath29 etc , where @xmath30 is a density parameter for the isolated region only .",
    "( physically , the critical density is that within a spatially flat wall region . )",
    "thus if we take @xmath31 at last scattering , when @xmath32 and when @xmath33 with @xmath34 , we are led to @xmath35 if @xmath36 .",
    "this crude estimate can be compared to the actual density variance determined from large scale structure surveys @xcite .",
    "sylos labini @xcite have recently determined the variance in the number density of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in the sdss - dr7 by dividing the full sample of 53,066 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath37 into @xmath38 equal nonoverlapping volumes . over the range @xmath39 , the standard deviation is found to be of order 8% , consistent with an earlier measurement of 7% by hogg  @xcite in a smaller lrg sample .",
    "these values are very close to our order of magnitude estimate of 6% .",
    "provided lrgs are correlated to the actual density , then the variance in the percentage density contrast will be commensurate .",
    "in fact , such variances can be used to constrain the dark matter density contrast at last scattering .",
    "a measurement of 8% would indicate , reversing the argument above , that a contrast of @xmath40 in nonbaryonic dark matter at last scattering is an order of magnitude too large .",
    "given a nearly scale  invariant spectrum of density perturbations , with perturbations nested in perturbations , our expectation is that the variance in density should not decrease appreciably if sample volumes are increased at nearby redshifts . in principle",
    ", it should be possible to calculate it as a function of scale , given the constraints from the cmb anisotropy spectrum at long wavelengths .",
    "for spatial slices at higher redshifts , looking further back in time , the variance would decrease in accord with ( [ est ] )  provided that a sample of objects such as lrgs can be found which does not exhibit strong evolutionary effects over the range of redshifts in question .    of course , the estimate based on ( [ est ] ) could be further refined to take backreaction into account ; but further accuracy can only be gained when one has a tighter estimate of the dark matter density contrast than simply an order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the statistical physics of cosmic structures in the  scenario may well differ from that of the flrw model @xcite in significant ways ; one has to revisit the whole problem from first principles .    in summary ,",
    "the observed universe is not assumed to be homogeneous or to approach any single global flrw model at any scale .",
    "the `` statistical homogeneity scale ''  which will coincide roughly with the bao scale  represents a scale above which the variance in density contrasts is bounded at the 10% level , and below which density constrasts become as large as they can possibly be .",
    "given our identification of dust particles coarse - grained at the scale of statistical homogeneity , and possible very large differences in spatial curvature and gravitational energy within such a cell , we do not assume that buchert average time parameter , @xmath41 , is the relevant parameter measured by every isotropic observer  those who see an isotropic cmb  within any dust cell .",
    "rather it is the time parameter measured by an isotropic observer whose local spatial curvature happens to coincide with the buchert volume  average spatial curvature @xmath42 .",
    "we employ an ansatz of an underlying quasilocal uniform hubble flow within a dust cell , below the scale of statistical homogeneity , in terms of local proper lengths with respect to local proper times , which both vary with gradients in spatial curvature and gravitational energy .",
    "this ansatz provides an implicit resolution of the sandage  de vaucouleurs paradox @xcite , and can be understood in terms of a generalization of the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "the metrics ( [ wgeom ] ) and ( [ vgeom ] ) are assumed to represent the local geometry for isotropic observers at finite infinity and at void centres respectively . within the scale of statistical homogeneity",
    "the metrics ( [ wgeom ] ) and ( [ vgeom ] ) are assumed to be patched together with a condition of uniform quasilocal bare hubble flow @xcite = = , which will preserve isotropy of the cmb .",
    "the mean cmb temperature and angular anisotropy scale will vary with the gradients in gravitational energy and spatial curvature , however .",
    "for the purpose of the buchert average we refer all quantities to one set of volume  average clocks : those that keep the time parameter @xmath43 of eqs .",
    "( [ buche1])([backr ] ) so that = = where t , t,[homo3]and , = , [ clocks1 ] are lapse functions of volume  average time , @xmath41 , relative to wall and void  centre observers respectively .",
    "the ratio of the relative hubble rates @xmath44 is related to the wall lapse function by = 1+(1-h_r)f_vh_r,[clocks2]and @xmath45 .",
    "the buchert equations for pressureless dust with volume  average density @xmath46 are solved @xcite in the two  scale approximation by assuming that there is no backreaction within walls and voids separately @xcite , but only in the combined average . with this assumption ,",
    "the kinematic backreaction term becomes @xcite = 6(1-)(-)^2= 2 ^ 23(1-).[q1 ] the resulting independent buchert equations consist of two coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations @xcite for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which may be written as & & + + = 1,[beq1 ] + & & ^-6_t(^2 ^ 6)+^-2_t(^2 ^ 2 ) = 0,[beq2 ] where & = & 8g0 ^ 33 ^ 2 ^ 3,[omm ] + & = & -^2/3 ^ 1/3 ^ 2 ^ 2,[omk ] + & = & -^29(1-)^2,[omq ] are the volume  average or `` bare '' matter density , curvature density and kinematic backreaction density parameters respectively , @xmath49 and @xmath50 being the present epoch values of @xmath51 and @xmath46 .",

    "for initial conditions at last scattering consistent with observations , solutions are found to reach within 1% of the tracking limit by a redshift @xmath53 @xcite .",

    "give volume average cosmic acceleration .",
    "the backreaction itself is not the sole reason for apparent cosmic acceleration ; that is also a question of how volume  average evolution is interpreted in terms of a local metric .",
    "one must take care in physically interpreting the solution of the buchert equation , since it does not represent a single exact solution of einstein s equations , but rather a spatial average .",
    "observers measure invariants of the local metric , and information carried by radial null geodesics from distant parts of the universe . in ref .",
    "@xcite a means of interpreting the buchert equation was developed as follows .",
    "first , since cosmological information is obtained by a radial spherically symmetric average , we construct a spherically symmetric geometry relative to an observer who measures volume  average time , and with a spatial volume scaling as @xmath57 , s^2=-^2+^2()^2 + ( , ) , + [ avgeom ] where the area quantity , @xmath58 , satisfies @xmath59 , @xmath60 being the conformal distance to the particle horizon relative to an observer at @xmath61 , since we have chosen the particle horizon as the scale of averaging .",

    "this leads to a relation = ^1/3 ^ 1/3[etarel ] along the geodesics .",
    "second , we account for volume and area factors by taking @xmath63 in ( [ wgeom ] ) to be given by the integral of ( [ etarel ] ) .",
    "the wall geometry ( [ wgeom ] ) , which may also be written ^2=-^2+^2/3 ^ 2 ^ 2/3 , on account of ( [ bav ] ) , is a local geometry only valid in spatially flat wall regions .",

    "@xcite in a void  dominated universe the dressed deceleration parameter is negative at late epochs , even though the bare deceleration parameter ( [ vdec ] ) is positive .",
    "thus cosmic acceleration is realised as an apparent effect due to the variance of local geometry from the average , leading to variance in the calibration of clocks and rods .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we will drop the subscript `` w '' from both @xmath62 and @xmath67 , as we will not need to make explicit reference to the time measured in void centres .",

    "nonetheless , the local geometry in an average void can be markedly different from the geometry in an average galaxy . given that observers and the things they observe are necessarily in bound structures , structure formation provides a selection effect in terms of our local geometry vis    vis the volume  average geometry in a void .",

    "what is notable is that the curve for the  model is considerably flatter than those of the  models .",
    "the origin of this feature may be understood qualitatively to arise from the fact that the magnitude of the apparent acceleration is considerably smaller in the  model , as compared to the magnitude of the acceleration in  models . for models",

    "in conclusion , the combination of tests we have described here have the potential to decide between the  cosmology , the  cosmology , and other homogeneous isotropic cosmologies with other sources of dark energy .",
    "a number of the tests have been devised by other researchers with homogeneous dark energy cosmologies in mind . in these cases",
    ", the results of independent analyses performed to date are encouraging for the  model .",
    "in particular ,    * a study of @xmath1 from recent datasets by zhao and zhang @xcite provides mild evidence at the 95% confidence level for an effective @xmath1 which crosses the `` phantom divide '' near the redshift @xmath170 indicated in fig .",

    "this paper has considered tests on scales greater than that of statistical homogeneity .",
    "there are many other such tests in addition to those which we have discussed . a number of these involve the cmb , such as the determination of the amplitude of the late  time integrated sachs  wolfe effect .",
    "such tests require first a computation of the detailed structure of the cmb acoustic peaks , recalibrated to the  cosmology .",
    "this is a very complicated task , which is why it has not been attempted here .",
    "however , it is an important goal for future work .    below the scale of statistical homogeneity",
    "we expect to see apparent variance in the hubble parameter , with a peak value 17% larger than the dressed global average value , measured over the scale of the dominant void fraction of @xmath15 mpc .",
    "since voids dominate by volume , a spherically symmetric average out to a fixed redshift will yield generally higher values until we average over volumes for which a typical line of sight intersects as many walls and voids as the global average .",
    "that is , the spherically averaged hubble parameter should decrease from a maximum at the @xmath15 mpc scale to the global average value at roughly the @xmath5 mpc scale .",
    "this general pattern is indeed borne out by the analysis of li and schwarz @xcite .",
    "much more detailed predictions of the expected variance could be made for the  model , by performing monte carlo simulations assuming a reasonable distribution of voids and minivoids packed into @xmath5 mpc spheres .",
    "this is an important goal for future work , as it would give a hubble bubble feature with unique characteristics , providing a test of a feature for which there is no counterpart in the standard cosmology .",
    "the recent determination of @xmath179 by the sh0es survey @xcite does provide a challenge for the  model .",
    "however , as we have just noted , in the  scenario spatial curvature gradients and apparent variance in the hubble flow below the scale of statistical homogeneity introduce systematic issues which complicate the determination of @xmath84 .",
    "riess  @xcite have done a very careful analysis , and make efforts to account for a hubble bubble  which they cut off at @xmath180 , approximately two thirds of the scale of statistical homogeneity . however , while they do not use supernovae with @xmath181 in the measurement of the hubble flow , their calibration of the distance ladder is necessarily made on nearby scales , in particular using the maser distance to ngc 4258 , at @xmath182 mpc , as an anchor . in the scenario the effects of spatial inhomogeneity and spatial curvature gradients are greatest on scales up to @xmath15 mpc . given that our own galaxy appears to be in a filament",
    ", this may have an impact in calibrating standard candles in the distance ladder .",
    "the megamaser project @xcite will therefore provide an interesting test , as it will yield purely geometric distances  independent of standard candle calibrations  on scales much larger than has been tested to date @xcite .",
    "the relevant scales are considered to be well into the hubble flow in the standard cosmology , and if distances of order @xmath183 mpc could be measured , would represent a substantial up to a large fraction of the scale of statistical homogeneity .",
    "the expectation in the  scenario is that provided such sources are sampled in directions in which the line of sight passes though a variety of different density fields , then there should be variance in the values of the hubble constant so derived",
    ". the sample of maser distances required to test the statistical expectations of the scenario would be considerably larger than the ten or so masers currently under investigation , but may become feasible in coming decades .    in comparing future measurements with model predictions it is important not only to extend the  model to develop counterparts of all the standard tests of the flrw models , but also to carefully examine the methods by which astronomical data is reduced , as in many cases the standard cosmology is either explicitly or implicitly assumed .",
    "as one case in point , bao analyses at present typically use a transformation to fourier space and the use of spectral transfer functions calibrated to the flrw models .",
    "thus while the results of gaztaaga  @xcite are suggestive in that they find results in agreement with our expected @xmath184  which is the physical parameter responsible for the degree of baryon drag in the primordial plasma  in applying results of independent analyses to the  model one must exercise caution until each step in the bao data reduction is understood directly from calibrations with the  model .",
    "another important case in which data reduction must be carefully considered is that of supernovae .",
    "it was recently pointed out @xcite that on bayesian evidence the  model is disfavoured as compared to the  model using the union @xcite and constitution @xcite compilations .",
    "however , the union and constitution data sets have been reduced using the salt method in which one simultaneously marginalizes over both empirical light curve parameters and cosmological parameters , assuming a flrw cosmology .",
    "hicken  @xcite discuss and compare four different methods of data reduction : salt , salt2 , mlcs31 and mlcs17 .",
    "they find some systematic differences between the methods ; for example , the salt methods give larger scatter at higher redshifts .",
    "as will be discussed in a forthcoming paper @xcite , use of the mlcs17 reduced data gives a different picture to the conclusions drawn by kwan , francis and lewis @xcite .",
    "in particular , analysis of the mlcs17reduced 372 sneia of hicken  gives bayesian evidence which favours the  model over the  model .",
    "thus there are already enough supernovae in principle to distinguish between the models ; except that systematic uncertainties in the empirical methods by which standard candles are standardized at present limit the conclusions that can be drawn .",
    "such issues are likely to also be a feature of many other astrophysical observations , and thus it is important that as many independent tests as possible are devised , and carried out carefully in a way in which any model  dependent assumptions are scrutinized .",
    "it is hoped that the tests discussed in this paper will provide a basis for comparing the  model with a physically well  grounded competing cosmological model .",
    "to fully compete , much further development of the  model is of course required .",
    "the standard cosmology consists of a base model for expansion of the universe  the flrw model dating from the 1920s  on top of which a sophisticated superstructure has been built over the last few decades .",
    "this superstructure includes features such as the generation of initial conditions from inflation , the bottom - up hierarchical structure formation process , and the results of large - scale structure simulations using newtonian gravity on top of the base expansion .",
    "the model of refs .",
    "@xcite replaces the base expansion of the flrw model by an average expansion which is not based on the friedmann equation , and this paper has explored a number of tests which can be performed based solely on the average geometrical properties .    many current cosmological tests of the standard cosmology  including detailed analysis of the cmb , galaxy clustering , redshift space distortions and weak lensing ",
    "can only be extended to the model once the standard cosmology superstructure built on top of the flrw model is adapted to the  model to understand the growth of structure at a more detailed level .",
    "although this may seem a daunting task , it is perhaps not as quite a tall order as one might at first think . in particular , the differences from a standard flrw model with inflationary initial conditions at last scattering are negligible , and consequently many large portions of the standard cosmology would not change . in particular , the mechanisms of physical processes are largely still the same , but what does change is the relationship of present average cosmological parameters to the initial perturbations .",
    "rederivation of the standard cosmology superstructure may largely be an issue of recalibration . where the calculations involve transfer functions that relate initial perturbation spectra to their time evolved distributions",

    "we require that the velocity perturbations and density perturbations at this epoch when @xmath202 are consistent with observation .",
