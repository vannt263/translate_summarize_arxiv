    "it has been known for decades that flares and filament eruptions ( which form cmes ) originate along polarity inversion lines ( pils ) of the radial photospheric magnetic field . in studies using photospheric vector magnetograms ,",
    "et al . _  ( 2003 , 2006 ) reported a strong correlation between active region cme productivity and the total length of pils with strong potential transverse fields ( @xmath0 g ) and strong gradients in the los field ( greater than 50 g mm@xmath1 ) .",
    "they used a @xmath22-day temporal window for correlating magnetogram properties with cmes .",
    "et al . _  ( 2003 ) noted that these correlations remained essentially unchanged for `` strong gradient '' thresholds from 25 to 100 g mm@xmath1 . using more than 2500 mdi ( los )",
    "magnetograms , schrijver ( 2007 ) found a strong correlation between major ( x- and m - class ) flares and the total unsigned magnetic flux near ( within @xmath3 mm ) strong - field pils  defined , in his work , as regions where oppositely signed los fields that exceed 150 g lie closer to each other than the instrument s @xmath4 2.9 mm resolution .",
    "schrijver s ( 2007 ) effective gradient threshold , @xmath4 100 g mm@xmath1 , is stronger than that used by falconer _",
    "et al . _  ( 2003 , 2006 ) .",
    "although these studies were published recently , the association between flares and @xmath5 sunspots , which posses opposite - sign umbrae within the same penumbra  and therefore also possess strong - field pils  has been well known for some time @xcite . in particular , @xmath6 spot groups are most likely to flare @xcite .",
    "a @xmath7 designation means no obvious north - south pil is present in an active region @xcite .",
    "we note that cui _",
    "et al . _  ( 2006 ) found that the occurrence of flares is correlated with the maximum magnitude of the horizontal gradient in active region los magnetograms  not just near pils  and that the correlation increases strongly for gradients stronger than @xmath4 400 g mm@xmath1 .",
    "one would expect the measures of cme- and flare- productivity developed by both falconer _",
    "et al . _  ( 2003,2006 ) schrijver ( 2007 ) to be larger for larger active regions .",
    "importantly , however , both studies showed that their measures of flux near strong - field pils is a better predictor of flare productivity than total unsigned magnetic flux .",
    "evidently , more flux is not , by itself , as significant a predictor of flares as more flux near strong - field pils .",
    "these intriguing results naturally raise the question , `` how do strong - field pils form ? '' for brevity , we hereafter refer to strong - field pils as spils .    schrijver ( 2007 ) contends that large spils form primarily , if not solely , by emergence .",
    "but he also noted that flux emergence , by itself , does not necessarily lead to the formation of spils .",
    "rather , a particular type of magnetic structure must emerge , one containing a long spil at its emergence .",
    "he suggests such structures are horizontally oriented , filamentary currents .    beyond the `` intact emergence '' scenario presented by schrijver ( 2007 )",
    ", other mechanisms can generate spils .",
    "when new flux emerges in close proximity to old flux  a common occurrence @xcite  spils can form along the boundaries between old and new flux systems .",
    "converging motions in flux that has already emerged can also generate spils .",
    "if the convergence leads to flux cancellation by some mechanism  emergence of u loops , submergence of inverse - u loops , or reconnective cancellation @xcite  then the total unsigned flux in the neighborhood of the spil might decrease as the spil forms .",
    "we note that , while cancellation in already - emerged fields can occur via flux emergence ( from upward moving u - loops ) , the emergence of a new flux system across the photosphere must increase the total unsigned flux that threads the photosphere .",
    "if the emergence of new flux were primarily responsible for spils , then a straightforward prediction would be that an increase in total unsigned flux should be correlated with an increase in the amount of unsigned flux near spils .",
    "hence , observations showing that increases in the unsigned flux near spils frequently occur without a corresponding increase in total unsigned flux would rule out new flux emergence as the sole cause of these strong field gradients .    our goal is to investigate the relationship between increases in the amount of unsigned flux near spils with changes in unsigned flux in the active regions containing the spils , to determine , if possible , which processes generate spils .",
    "from days - long time series of deprojected , 96-minute , full - disk mdi magnetograms for @xmath8 64 active regions , we computed the rates of change of unsigned flux near spils , following the method described by schrijver ( 2007 ) .",
    "we also computed the rates of change of total unsigned line - of - sight magnetic flux these active regions .",
    "our active region sample was chosen for use in a separate study of the relationships between surface flows derived from magnetograms and cmes .",
    "for the purposes of that study , we typically selected active regions with a single , well defined pil , for ease in identifying the presence of shearing and/or converging flows some cme models employ @xcite .",
    "the sample used here includes regions from 1996 - 1998 , and includes regions that did and did not produce cmes .",
    "some of our magnetograms image the same active region as it rotated back onto the disk one or more times .",
    "also , some of our selected regions are so decayed that they lack spots , and therefore have no noaa designation .    here , we analyze @xmath9 magnetograms .",
    "pixels more that 45@xmath10 from disk center were ignored . to convert the los field , @xmath11 , to an estimated radial field , @xmath12 ,",
    "cosine corrections were used , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the angle from disk center .",
    "triangulation was used to interpolate the @xmath12 data  regularly gridded in the plane - of - sky , but irregularly gridded in spherical coordinates @xmath15 on the solar surface  onto points @xmath16 corresponding to a regularly gridded , mercator projection of the spherical surface .",
    "this projection was adopted because it is conformal ( locally shape - preserving ) , necessary to ensure displacements measured in the tracking study mentioned above were not biased in direction . for computing gradients , a conformal projection is also appropriate .",
    "the background grayscale in figure [ fig : uno ] is a typical reprojected magnetogram .",
    "we note that the price of preserving shapes in the deprojection is distortion of scales ; but this can be easily corrected .",
    "g and @xmath17 g ( respectively ) .",
    "the outer black and white contours show the outlines of @xmath18 , dilated bitmaps of the strong - field masks with a 3 @xmath19 3 kernel function . for this magnetogram , the dilated bitmaps overlap at a single pixel , at @xmath20 ( 112,91).,width=528 ]    each active region was tracked over 3 - 5 days , and cropped with a moving window .",
    "a list of tracked active regions and mpeg movies of the active regions , are online , at ` http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/\\simyanli/lct/ `  .",
    "to identify spils , we used the gradient identification technique of schrijver ( 2007 ) . for a magnetogram at time @xmath21 , binary positive / negative strong - field masks  where @xmath22 g and @xmath17 g , respectively  were constructed , then dilated by a ( 3x3 ) kernel to create dilated positive and negative bitmaps , @xmath18 .",
    "these procedures are illustrated in figure [ fig : uno ] .",

    "@xmath32 is the total unsigned field the window , @xmath33 . , width=528 ]    following schrijver ( 2007 ) , we totaled the unsigned magnetic field over the weighting map to determine @xmath32 , a measure of the unsigned flux near spils , @xmath34 from a sample of more than 2500 mdi magnetograms , schrijver ( 2007 ) showed that @xmath32 is correlated with major ( x- and m - class ) flares .",
    "for each of the @xmath35 = 1621 magnetograms with @xmath36 , we summed the weighted absolute magnetic field in the previous magnetogram , @xmath37 , using the weighting map from @xmath21 , to compute the backwards - difference @xmath38 , @xmath39    we also computed the change in summed , unsigned field , @xmath40 to determine if new flux is emerging or if flux is canceling .",
    "if new flux is emerging , we expect @xmath41 .",
    "if flux is canceling , we expect @xmath42 .",
    "like schrijver ( 2007 ) , we have opted to keep @xmath32 in units of flux density ; for simplicity , we also keep @xmath43 in these same units .    when the overlap map @xmath25 for @xmath44 is identically zero , @xmath32 is also zero , and @xmath38 and @xmath43 are not computed",
    ".    in  [ sec : intro ] we discussed processes that can cause changes in @xmath45 what processes can lead to @xmath46 ?",
    "emergence of new flux or cancellation ( both only happen at pils ) can make @xmath47 , and these processes are probably related to evolution in @xmath32 .",
    "flux can also cross into or out of the cropping window . since our cropping windows were selected to include essentially all of each tracked active region s flux , systematic errors arising in this way",
    "are expected to be small .",
    "a more severe effect is the `` unipolar appearance '' phenomenon characterized by lamb _",
    "( 2007 ) , who found that the majority of newly detected flux in the quiet sun is due to coalescence of previously existing , but unresolved , single - polarity flux into concentrations large and strong enough to detect . while it is unclear",
    "if the conclusion reached by lamb _ et al . _ ( 2007 ) for the quiet sun also applies in active regions , this is plausible .",
    "moreover , much as flux can `` appear , ''",
    "flux can also disappear , via dispersive photospheric flows or perhaps even molecular diffusivity .",
    "also , simultaneous emergence of new flux and cancellation of existing flux can occur within the same active region , masking the effects of both processes .",
    "practically , therefore , we can only refer to increases in unsigned flux as `` possible new flux emergence , '' and to decreases in unsigned flux as `` possible cancellation . ''",
    "in figure [ fig : tres ] , we show a scatter plot of changes in @xmath32 as a function of changes in @xmath48 . the plot does not show the full range in @xmath43 , but the @xmath38 for outliers on the horizontal axes are near zero .",
    "one striking feature of the plot is its flatness , i.e. , that most changes in @xmath48 are not associated with any change in @xmath32 . in table",
    "[ tab : uno ] , we tabulated the data points in each quadrant of this plot .",
    "clearly , increases in @xmath32 , the unsigned flux near spils , usually occur simultaneously with increases in the unsigned flux over the entire active region .",
    "increases in @xmath32 only occur less frequently when flux is decreasing , i.e. , during cancellation .     as a function of changes in @xmath48 .",
    "increases in @xmath32 , the unsigned flux near spils , usually occur simultaneously with increases in the unsigned flux over the entire active region .",
    "increases in @xmath32 only occur rarely when flux is decreasing , i.e. , during cancellation . for a breakdown of the data points in each quadrant ,",
    "see table [ tab : uno].,width=528 ]       we set out to answer the question , `` how do strong - field pils form ? '' we related changes in total , unsigned flux over whole active regions with changes in total , unsigned flux in subwindows of the same active regions  defined by weighting maps .",
    "one might expect , therefore , that these quantities should be correlated , casting doubt about our ability to discrimintate between changes in total flux in active regions and in subwindows",
    ". if the two were strongly correlated , the excess of events with @xmath49 and @xmath41 might not be very meaningful .",
    "in fact , however , @xmath38 and @xmath43 are poorly correlated : the two have a linear correlation coefficient @xmath50 , and a rank - order coefficient of @xmath51 this suggests that the relationship between increases in @xmath32 and increases in total , unsigned active region flux is not an artifact of our approach .",
    "nonetheless , our active region sample is not ideally suited to address the origin of spils , generally .",
    "our sample was not unbiased with respect to active region morphology ; we selected regions with well - defined pils .",
    "in addition , our sample included some decayed active regions that noaa ar designations .",
    "consequently , we believe that a follow - up study , with a much larger , unbiased sample of active regions , is warranted ."
