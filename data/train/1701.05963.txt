    "the double or extended main - sequence turnoffs ( emstos ) were discovered in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of intermediate - age massive star clusters in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "one interpretation of the emstos is that the clusters have experienced an extended star - formation histories ( esfh ) with a duration of @xmath2 myr @xcite , which disagrees with classical understanding of star clusters being simple stellar populations ( ssps ) .",
    "the emstos were also discovered in young clusters ngc 1856 @xcite , ngc 1755 @xcite , ngc 1850 @xcite , and ngc 1866 @xcite .",
    "moreover , ngc 1856 , ngc 1755 , and ngc 1866 are found to exhibit dual main sequences ( ms ) below their msto @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the emstos is the effects of star rotation @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the extension of msto caused by star rotations is related to the rotation rate of stars , the efficiency of rotational mixing , and the age of star clusters .",
    "a relatively high rotation rate and a high efficient rotational mixing are required to explain the emstos of young clusters [ see figure 8 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see niederhofer et al .",
    "2015a and dantona et al . 2015 ) ] .",
    "@xcite claimed that the emsto of ngc 1856 can be explained by a rotation of @xmath3 times the keplerian rotation rate ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "but in order to explain the dual mss of clusters ngc 1856 and ngc 1755 , the rotation rate of @xmath5 @xmath4 is required @xcite . * a large number of rapid rotating stars have been found in ngc 1850 and ngc 1856 by @xcite . *",
    "* however , neither stellar models with different ages only , nor rapid rotating models with different rotation rates , properly reproduce the observed split ms and emsto of ngc 1866 @xcite .",
    "the populations with both different ages and different rotation rates are needed to explain ngc 1866 @xcite .",
    "* moreover , @xcite stated that their rotating models fail to reproduce the stars  after the end of the central h - burning phase \" of ngc 1856 .",
    "* however , these stars might be stars with decretion disks @xcite seen nearly edge on , so they suffer from extinction which pushes them into this region .",
    "*    another coeval interpretation of the emstos is interacting binaries @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that interacting binaries including merged binary systems and the binaries with mass transfer can lead to both the emstos and the dual red - clumps .",
    "the effects of the interacting binaries on the cmds of some clusters should not be neglected , although the number of the interacting binaries in a cluster could be not enough to explain the emstos alone .",
    "one of the important predictions of the esfh scenario is that the ongoing star - formation should be observed in young star clusters with an age of a few hundred myr .",
    "however , up to now , the expected ongoing star - formation is not observed in young clusters with age beyond 10 myr @xcite . @xcite and @xcite argued that the emstos can occur only in clusters with masses larger than a threshold of about @xmath6 and with escape velocity greater than @xmath7 km s@xmath8 .",
    "however , the emstos of ngc 1755 @xcite and ngc 411 @xcite would represent a challenge for this scenario . * furthermore , the observation that there exists a strong correlation between cluster age and the inferred age spread as found by @xcite also rules out an actual age spread being the origin of the emsto . *",
    "@xcite analyzed the sub - giant branch ( sgb ) of ngc 1651 harbouring an emsto and found that the sgb is narrower and offsets from what would be inferred from the emsto region if the large age spreads would be present within the cluster .",
    "similar results were found in ngc 1806 and ngc 1846 @xcite and ngc 411 @xcite .",
    "hence , they concluded that age spreads are not likely to be the cause of the emsto phenomenon .",
    "however , @xcite found that the cross - sgb profiles of ngc 1651 , ngc 1806 , and ngc 1846 are consistent with their cross - msto profiles when the latter are interpreted as age distributions .",
    "conversely , their sgb morphologies are inconsistent with those of simulated ssps .",
    "the origin of the emstos is still an open question .",
    "the overshooting of the convective core ( ovcc ) can bring more hydrogen - rich material into h - burning core , which significantly prolongs the lifetime of the burning of core hydrogen and enhances the he - core mass left behind .",
    "the distance of the overshooting of a convection is defined as @xmath9 , where is a free parameter and @xmath9 is the local pressure scale - height .",
    "recently , @xcite developed a method to determine the size of the convective core including the overshooting region from observed oscillation frequencies of low - degree @xmath10-modes .",
    "it was found that the value of is variable for stars with an approximatelly equal mass .",
    "for example , the value of is @xmath11 for kic 9812850 with @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 for kic 2837475 with @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 for procyon with @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath16 for hd 49933 with @xmath17 @xcite , and @xmath18 for kic 11081729 with @xmath19 @xcite . * the typical errors of the value of are @xmath20 . *",
    "if a variable overshooting exists in stars with masses larger than @xmath21 , the msto of young- and intermediate - age star clusters would be affected by the overshooting .    in this work , we mainly focus on whether the emstos of young- and intermediate - age star clusters can be explained by the effects of the ovcc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we show our calculation results in section 2 , and the results are compared with observations in section 3 , then we discuss and summarize the results in section 4 .",
    "in order to study the effects of overshooting of the convective core on the msto of star clusters , we computed a grid of evolutionary models with the initial metallicity @xmath22 , in the range of @xmath23 with a resolution of @xmath11 , supplemented by @xmath24 , and masses between @xmath5 and @xmath25 .",
    "the resolution of mass varies from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "we used the yale rotation evolution code ( yrec ) @xcite to construct the models in its non - rotation configuration .",
    "the opal equation - of - state table eos2005 @xcite and opal opacity table gn93 @xcite were adopted , supplemented by the @xcite opacity tables at low temperature .",
    "the diffusion and settling of both helium and heavy elements are computed by using the diffusion coefficients of @xcite for models with a mass less than @xmath28 .",
    "convection is treated according to the standard mixing - length theory .",
    "the value of the mixing - length parameter is fixed at @xmath29 .",
    "the full mixing of material is assumed in the overshooting region .",
    "all models are evolved from zero - age ms to the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the evolutionary tracks of models with @xmath30 but with different .",
    "the evolutionary tracks are obviously affected by the ovcc .",
    "the model with a large mainly exhibits to be bluer than the model with a smaller at a given age and the lifetime of the burning of core hydrogen is significantly prolonged , but the lifetime of sgb is shrunk . for example , the lifetime of the sgb of the model with @xmath30 and = 0 is @xmath31 myr , which is @xmath32 of its ms lifetime . but the lifetime of the sgb of the model with @xmath30 and = @xmath33 is only @xmath24 myr , which is about @xmath34 of its ms lifetime .",
    "the hertzsprung gap of the model with a large is obviously narrower than that of the model without the ovcc .",
    "the values of the central hydrogen @xmath35 at points b , e , and g in figure [ fig1 ] are about @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively , while the values of @xmath35 at points c , f , and h are around @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "compared with the whole ms lifetime of stars with a large , the timescale of their ms hook is very short .",
    "thus we define the points b , e , and g as the end of central h - burning phase .",
    "due to the fact that more hydrogen - rich material is brought into h - burning core by the ovcc , the stars with the ovcc produce more nuclear energy .",
    "part of the energy makes the stars more luminous .",
    "the other is transformed into internal energy , which leads to the fact that the stars expand obviously , i.e. , the radius of the stars increases significantly . as a consequence ,",
    "the effective temperature of the stars decreases at the end of central h - burning phase . and the star with a larger is brighter and redder than the star with a small at the end of central h - burning phase .",
    "thus , the ms width and msto of a star cluster must be extended by the presence of the ovcc with different .",
    "moreover , due to the fact that the timescale of the ms hook of the model with a large is significantly shrunk , the structure of ms hook of a young star cluster including many stars with the large is hard to be exhibited in the observed cmd of the cluster .      in order to understand the effects of an ovcc on the msto of young- and intermediate - age star clusters , we calculated isochrones with different . to obtain the cmds of the isochrones , the theoretical properties",
    "( [ fe / h ] , , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) of models are transformed into colors and magnitudes using the color transformation tables of @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the cmds of isochrones of models with different . comparing the isochrones of models with a large to those of models with a smaller",
    ", one can find that the upper ms and the msto of young- and intermediate - age star clusters are extended by the ovcc when the different ovccs exist in clusters .",
    "however , the lower ms of the clusters are almost not affected . for the isochrones with the age of @xmath47 myr , the separation between the isochrone of models with @xmath48 and that of models with @xmath49 is about 0.1 mag in color u - v at m@xmath50 , but it is only around @xmath51 mag at m@xmath52 . however , the separation is about @xmath27 mag in color v - i at m@xmath53 .",
    "the emsto of young clusters is better visible in u - v than in v - i ( see the panel @xmath54 of figure [ fig2 ] and figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "these characteristics are similar to those found in ngc 1856 and ngc 1755 @xcite * and are also expected in the rotational scenario . *",
    "we assumed that a distribution of such as a bimodal of @xmath55 and @xmath33 exists in a star cluster .",
    "the isochrones of models with @xmath56 are chosen as the standard one .",
    "the isochrones of models with a large are compared to those of models with @xmath56 to obtain the equivalent age spread caused by the ovcc .",
    "hereafter , the beginning and the end points of ms hook of an isochrone are labeled as b and c , respectively . the local bluest point",
    "( local minimum u - v ) of ms is marked as point a , and the brightest point ( minimum @xmath57 ) after point c is labeled as point d ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the values of the central hydrogen @xmath35 of models at points a , b , c , and d on the isochrone with age @xmath58 myr are about @xmath59 , @xmath36 , @xmath39 , and @xmath55 , respectively . according to the initial mass function , the more massive the stars , the less the number of the stars . moreover , the more massive the stars , the faster their evolutions .",
    "the stars between point c and d ( @xmath35 between about @xmath39 and 0 for @xmath56 but between about @xmath40 and 0 for @xmath48 ) should be rare in a young star cluster .",
    "thus we compare the non - overshooting isochrone between point a and b to the isochrone with an overshooting to obtain the equivalent age spread .",
    "for example , inspected by eyes , the non - overshooting isochrone between point a and b in figure [ fig4 ] is considered to overlap with the overshooting isochrone with @xmath48 and age @xmath60 myr .",
    "thus , the equivalent age spread caused by the overshooting with @xmath48 is @xmath61 myr when the age of the cluster is @xmath47 myr .",
    "the equivalent age spreads for other isochrones with different and ages are obtained in the similar way .",
    "the `` points c and d '' on the isochrone with age @xmath60 myr and @xmath48 can not be matched by those of any isochrone with @xmath56 .",
    "thus , we can not obtain the equivalent age spread through comparing the points c or d of isochrones with different .    due to the fact that the models with a large are obviously brighter and redder than the models with a smaller at the end of central h - burning phase , the end point of the central h - burning phase of an isochrone with @xmath48 can not be reproduced by that of the isochrones with @xmath56 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "thus , when one uses the isochrones with a small to fit the cmd of a cluster including many stars with a larger , one could find that there are many stars that can not be reproduced after the end of the central h - burning phase .    in order to understand whether the effects of the ovcc can explain the observed emstos of star clusters , the equivalent age spreads caused by the ovcc are extracted as mentioned above and compared to observed ones .",

    "however , when the age of star clusters is larger than 2 gyr , the equivalent age spreads caused by = 0.2 almost not increase with an increase in age of clusters .",
    "this is because the convective core of low mass stars shrink during their ms .",
    "but for more massive stars , the convective core increases in size during the initial stage of ms of these stars before the core begins to shrink .",
    "the larger the , the later the core begins to shrink . in the late stage of the ms of stars , when the core shrinks to a certain degree , the chemical composition of the core including the overshooting region is mainly helium . at this time , the effects of the overshooting on the evolution of stars are not significant .",

    "the radii of msto stars with a large are much larger than those of msto stars with a small .",
    "thus , the periods of the former could be about @xmath130 times as long as those of the latter .",
    "for example , at the end of the central h - burning phase of a star with @xmath30 , the period of the model with @xmath102 is about @xmath131 times as long as that of the model with @xmath56 .",
    "in other words , if the variable exists in a star cluster , long - periodic pulsating / variable stars ( in bright msto ) and short - periodic pulsating stars ( in faint msto ) would be observed in the star cluster .",
    "this case can not occur in rotation scenario and esfh scenario .",
    "for example , a difference of @xmath90 myr in age can only lead to a change of about @xmath132 , depending on the age , in frequencies or periods of pulsation of msto stars .",
    "gravity darkening caused by the angle of view can not result in any change in the frequencies or periods .",
    "thus , asteroseismical observation for the young- and intermediate - age star clusters would directly rule out or confirm ovcc scenario , and show what plays a dominant role in the origin of the emsto . *",
    "figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig10 ] show that the ovcc can lead to the observed emstos .",
    "the variable ovcc is a good potential mechanism for explaining the emstos of star clusters .",
    "however , it is dependent on the fraction of stars with a large that whether or not the ovcc is responsible for the observed emstos of star clusters .",
    "asteroseismology only tells us that the value of can be different for different stars with an approximatelly equal mass .",
    "it has not revealed the fraction of stars with a large .",
    "why there are different for stars is another open question for asteroseismology and stellar physicists .",
    "the ovcc is more efficient than rotation at bringing h - rich material into the h - burning core .",
    "the effects of the ovcc with @xmath48 on the msto of star clusters is hard to be mimicked by the effects of a rapid rotation . in order to reproduce the stars of ngc 1856 at the end of central h - burning phase , an overshooting of around 0.4 @xmath9 is required for our models .",
    "when both the ovcc and a rapid ratation exist in stars , the msto is mainly affected by the effects of the ovcc . however , the centrifugal effect of the rapid rotation playing a role in the ms stars whose envelope is radiative leads to the fact that the split of ms is more significant .",
    "the points c and d of the rotating isochrones with @xmath85 can be matched by those of non - rotating isochrones with the same but with different ages .",
    "the equivalent age spread obtained by comparing points c and d of a rotating isochrone to those of non - rotating isochrone with the same is twice more than that obtained through comparing points a and b of the rotating isochrone to those of non - rotating isochrone . @xcite",
    "might overestimate the equivalent age spreads caused by rotation .",
    "moreover , the higher the efficiency of the rotational mixing , the more the h - rich material brought into the h - burning core , the larger the luminosity of the rotating models at the end of central h - burning phase , which can lead to an increase in the equivalent age spread caused by rotation .",
    "these may be the reason why the equivalent age spread of @xcite rotating models can match that of ngc 1856 but that of our rotating models can not .",
    "however , a high efficiently rotational mixing in the radiative region of stars can hinder stellar expansion and lead to the fact that the evolutionary tracks of the stars move towards the upper left of the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "thus , the effects of a large are different from that of rotation .    the equivalent age spread between the isochrone with @xmath48 and that with @xmath56 in panel @xmath97 of figure [ fig10 ] is @xmath133 myr , and the spread between the isochrone with @xmath102 and that with @xmath77 is @xmath134 myr , which are close to the spread of 150 myr determined by @xcite . the equivalent age spread between the isochrone with @xmath102 and that with @xmath56 is @xmath135 myr , which is larger than that determined by @xcite .",
    "however , figure [ fig10 ] shows that the width between the msto of the isochrone with @xmath102 and that with @xmath56 does not exceed that of ngc 1856 .    due to the fact that the lifetimes of the sgb of the stars with a large are much shorter than those of the stars without overshooting or with a small",
    ", the population of sgb is not only dependent on the number of stars but also dependent on .",
    "moreover , the sgb of young star clusters could be polluted by the cheb interacting binaries .",
    "thus , the sgb of young star clusters can not be used to study the origin of the emstos .    * the effects of ovcc on the msto of young- and intermediate - age star clusters are similar to that of rotation . the equivalent age spread caused by rotation",
    "has a peak at age @xmath136 gyr @xcite , which is dependent on the efficiency of rotational mixing .",
    "the observationally inferred age spread also has a peak at age @xmath136 gyr @xcite .",
    "this characteristic does not occur in ovcc models .",
    "the emsto caused by the ovcc is still present in star clusters with age @xmath84 gyr .",
    "the emsto is hard to be exactly described by the equivalent age spreads relative to the same age isochrone with @xmath56 , especially for star clusters with age @xmath137 gyr .",
    "our models show that the width of the emsto caused by a of @xmath11 or @xmath33 at age @xmath138 gyr is about @xmath3 times as wide as that at age @xmath13 gyr .",
    "the width of the emsto caused by the ovcc has a peak in color v - i of cmd of star clusters at age @xmath67 gyr , and then decreases with an increase or decrease in age , which can not be reflected by the equivalent age spreads . in rotation models of @xcite ,",
    "the emsto can occurs in star clusters with age larger than @xmath139 gyr because rotational mixing exists in stars like the sun @xcite .",
    "thus the emsto of star clusters with age @xmath140 gyr can not be used to differentiate ovcc models and rotation models . if emsto does not exist in star clusters with ages between @xmath139 and @xmath141 gyr that is hard to be explained by ovcc scenario .",
    "perhaps , that is due to the fraction of stars with a large being small in the star clusters .",
    "*    * at the end of the central h - burning phase of rapid rotation models , the surface nitrogen abundance can be enriched by @xmath142 in young star clusters for a between 0.4 and 0.6 .",
    "this does not happen in the rotating models with @xmath70 and the non - rotating models .",
    "moreover , the pulsating periods of bright msto stars would be longer than those of faint msto stars in ovcc scenario because the former has a low mean density , which also does not occur in rotation scenario and esfh scenario .",
    "these characteristics could aid us in differentiating ovcc scenario and rotation scenario . *",
    "asteroseismology has shown that the value of overshooting parameter of the convective core is variable for stars with an approximatelly equal mass .",
    "we calculated the effects of the ovcc on the msto of young- and intermediate - age star clusters , and found that the observed emstos of young- and intermediate - age star clusters can be explained well by the effects of the ovcc with different . the equivalent age spread caused by the ovcc increases with an increase in age of star clusters and an increase in . due to the fact that the convective core of stars can shrink during the late stage of ms",
    ", the equivalent age spread can not increase continuously with an increase in age of star clusters .",
    "the emstos of ngc 1856 can be reproduced well by the coeval populations with different .",
    "the effects of a rotation with @xmath85 and the rotational mixing efficiency for the sun on the msto of a cluster with an age of @xmath106 myr are negligible compared with the effects of the ovcc . however , the presence of the rotation can result in the fact that the split of ms of the cluster is more significant .",
    "the emstos of star clusters may be related to the effects of the ovcc with different . * but keep in mind that a single value of @xmath0 can not produce any emsto in the cmd of clusters .",
    "asteroseismical observation would confirm or rule out ovcc scenario . *",
