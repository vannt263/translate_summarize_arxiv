    "a remarkable outcome of the heavy ion experiments at rhic  @xcite is the large elliptic flow observed in the collisions .",
    "phenomenological hydrodynamical models that fit the rhic data appear to require that the quark gluon matter has a very small value for the dimensionless ratio of the viscosity to the entropy density  @xcite .",
    "this ratio @xmath1 , a measure of the `` perfect fluidity '' of the system , is estimated to be @xmath2  @xcite , where @xmath3 is a conjectured universal lower bound  @xcite .",
    "its was shown recently  @xcite that the degree of perfectness of the quark - gluon fluid produced at rhic is sensitive to details of the initial spatial distribution of the produced matter at the onset of hydrodynamic flow .",
    "an important feature of the hydrodynamic models is that they require very early thermalization after the collision .",
    "estimates for the thermalization time , which range from @xmath4 fm  @xcite , are difficult to reconcile with a simple picture of thermalization arising from the rapid scattering of quasi - particles at rates greater than the expansion rate of the fluid .",
    "the uncertainty principle tells us that for @xmath5 fm , modes with momenta @xmath6 mev are not even on - shell , let alone amenable to being described as quasi - particles undergoing scattering . while a quasi - particle description is not essential to thermalization , it is the simplest one , and other realizations are more complicated . with regard to the issue of flow however , it is sufficient to note that one requires primarily that matter be isotropic and ( nearly ) conformal to obtain a closed form expression for the hydrodynamic equations  @xcite .",
    "how isotropization and ( subsequently ) thermalization is achieved in heavy ion collisions is an outstanding problem which requires that the problem be considered _",
    "ab initio_. what this means it that one needs to understand and compute the properties of the relevant degrees of freedom in the nuclear wavefunctions and how these degrees of freedom decohere in a collision to produce quark - gluon matter .",
    "an _ ab initio _ approach to the problem can be formulated within the framework of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) effective field theory , which describes the relevant degrees of freedom in the nuclei as dynamical classical fields coupled to static color sources  @xcite .",
    "the computational power of this approach is a consequence of the dynamical generation of a semi - hard scale , the saturation scale  @xcite , which allows a weak coupling treatment of the relevant degrees of freedom  @xcite in the high energy nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "there has been significant progress recently in applying the cgc effective field theory to studying the early time behavior of the matter produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "inclusive quantities such as the pressure and the energy density in this matter ( called the glasma  @xcite ) can be written as expressions that factorize the universal properties of the nuclear wavefunctions ( measurable for instance in proton - nucleus or electron - nucleus collisions ) from the detailed dynamics of the matter in collision  @xcite .",
    "key to this approach are the quantum fluctuations around the classical fields in the wavefunctions and in the collision .",
    "quantum fluctuations that are invariant under boosts can be isolated in universal functionals that evolve with energy .",
    "there are however also quantum fluctuations that are not boost invariant which are generated during the collision .",
    "these quantum fluctuations can grow rapidly and therefore play a significant role in the subsequent temporal evolution of the glasma .",
    "the problem of how to treat these so - called `` secular divergences '' of perturbative series is very general and occurs in a wide variety of dynamical systems  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the role of time dependent quantum fluctuations in heavy ion collisions bears a strong analogy to their role in the evolution of the early universe  @xcite . in the latter case , quantum fluctuations around a rapidly decaying classical field , the inflaton , are enhanced due to parametric resonance , and it is conjectured that this dynamics termed `` preheating ''  @xcite may lead to turbulent thermalization  @xcite in the early universe .",
    "it is therefore very important to understand the precise role of these quantum fluctuations in heavy ion collisions to determine whether they play an analogous role to that in the early universe in the isotropization / thermalization of the system .",
    "their computation in a gauge theory is quite involved so for simplicity , we shall in this paper first attack this problem in a scalar @xmath0 field theory . like qcd , the coupling is dimensionless in this theory and the fields are self interacting .",
    "in addition , we choose initial conditions for our study that are similar to those in the cgc treatment of heavy ion collisions .",
    "it must be said at the outset that there are important differences between the two theories and there is no _ a priori _ guarantee that the lessons learnt in one case will translate automatically to the other .",
    "the cgc initial conditions , for weak couplings @xmath7 , specifically lead to a power counting scheme where the leading contribution to inclusive quantities is the classical contribution of order @xmath8 .",
    "quantum corrections begin at @xmath9 and their contribution can be expressed as real - time partial differential equations for small fluctuations in the classical background , with purely retarded initial conditions .",
    "we will show that there are modes of the small fluctuation field that grow very rapidly and can become as large as the classical field on time scales of interest in the problem .",
    "we observe that there are two sorts of rapidly growing modes of the fluctuation field .",
    "one are modes that enjoy parametric resonance and grow exponentially .",
    "these modes are however localized in a rather narrow resonance band .",
    "the zero mode and low lying modes grow linearly and can also influence the temporal evolution of the system .",
    "both sorts of `` secular '' terms can be isolated and resummed to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the resulting expressions are stable and can be expressed as an ensemble average over a spectrum of quantum fluctuations convolved with the _ leading order _ inclusive quantity which , for a particular fluctuation field , is a functional of the classical field shifted by that quantum fluctuation .",
    "we note that a similar observation was made previously in the context of inflationary cosmology  @xcite .",
    "the fact that one can express resummed expressions for the pressure and energy density as ensemble averages over quantum fluctuations has profound consequences .",
    "without resummation , the relation between the energy density and the pressure is not single valued . for the resummed expressions , while the relation between the pressure and energy density is not single valued at early times , it becomes so after a finite evolution time .",
    "this development of an `` equation of state '' therefore allows one to write the conservation equation for the resummed energy momentum tensor @xmath10 as a closed form set of equations , which are the equations of ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "this of course suggests that the system behaves as a perfect fluid .",
    "if the considerations in our paper can be applied to a gauge theory , the result would have significant ramifications for the interpretation of the heavy ion experiments and the extraction of @xmath1 in hydrodynamical models .",
    "the evolution of the system towards the equation of state characteristic of hydrodynamic flow can be interpreted as arising from a phase decoherence of the different classical trajectories of the energy momentum tensor for different initial conditions given by the ensemble of quantum fluctuations . for a scalar @xmath0 theory ,",
    "the frequency of the periodic classical trajectories is proportional to the amplitude .",
    "therefore , for different initial values of the amplitude , the different trajectories are phase shifted . the ensuing cancellations between trajectories results in the single valued relation between the pressure and the energy density .",
    "while it appears that decoherence can arise from the zero mode and near lying modes alone , the inclusion of the resonant band significantly alters the decoherence of the system .",
    "similar behavior has been seen in models of reheating after inflation @xcite .",
    "in particular , one sees that quantum de - coherence of the inflaton field leads to a transition from a dust  like equation of state to a radiation dominated era .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the decoherence and concomitant fluidity observed in our numerical simulations implies thermalization of the system .",
    "we first investigate the behavior of the ensemble of initial conditions in the _ poincar _ phase plane for the toy case of uniform background field and fluctuations .",
    "one sees that the initially localized trajectories spread around a close loop filling the phase - space as one would expect for the phase - space density of a micro - canonical ensemble . for the toy example",
    "considered , the ensemble average of the trace of the energy momentum tensor can be expressed at large times as the time average along a single trajectory in the _ poincar _ phase plane .",
    "for the scale invariant @xmath0 theory , this average is zero with the consequence that the energy momentum tensor becomes traceless resulting in a single valued relation between the energy density and the pressure .",
    "going beyond the toy example , for the general case of spatially non - uniform fluctuations , there is no easy way to visualize trajectories on the _ poincar _ phase plane because the system is infinite dimensional .",
    "however , because the numerical problem is formulated on a lattice , one can look at a small sub - system on this lattice and study its event - by - event energy fluctuations .",
    "starting from a gaussian initial distribution , we see that the distribution converges to an exponential form",
    ". one can also study the moments of the energy distribution ; these again demonstrate a rapid change from initial transient values to stationary values . while the behavior is close to those expected from a canonical thermal ensemble , it is premature from our present studies to make definitive conclusions .",
    "this will require a careful study of the effects of varying the coupling and volume effects and will be left to a future study .",
    "we note however that the formalism developed in our paper is well suited to the study of thermalization of quantum systems .",
    "it has been argued previously  @xcite that quantum systems will thermalize if they satisfy berry s conjecture  @xcite .",
    "this conjecture states that the high lying quantum eigenstates of a system whose classical behavior is chaotic and ergodic have a wavefunction that behaves as a linear superposition of plane waves whose coefficients are gaussian random variables .",
    "when an inclusive measurement is performed on such an eigenstate , one obtains results that agree with the predictions of the micro - canonical equilibrium ensemble , a property that has been dubbed `` eigenstate thermalization '' in  @xcite .",
    "if the state at @xmath11 is a coherent superposition of such eigenstates , the micro - canonical predictions become valid only after the states in the superposition have sufficiently decohered ",
    "thus for quantum systems where berry s conjecture apply , thermalization appears to be a consequence of decoherence .",
    "the ensemble of quantum fluctuations included via the resummation we develop in the section 2.6 leads to fields that have precisely this behavior ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : berry-1]-[eq : berry-2 ] ) ) .",
    "our interest ultimately is in qcd , where the classical behavior of the system is believed to be chaotic  @xcite .",
    "because much of our formalism can be extended to gauge theories , we anticipate that a first principles treatment of thermalization is feasible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model scalar theory and the cgc - like initial conditions for its temporal evolution .",
    "we then discuss the computation of @xmath10 at leading and next - to - leading order .",
    "the problem of secular divergences is noted , and a stable resummation procedure is developed . a simplified toy model is considered in section 3 , wherein only spatially uniform fluctuations are considered .",
    "the behavior of the resummed pressure and energy density and their relaxation to an equation of state is studied .",
    "these results are interpreted and understood as a consequence of the decoherence of the system which allows one to equate ensemble averages to a temporal average over individual classical trajectories . for the longitudinally expanding case ,",
    "temporal evolution in the toy model displays the behavior of a fluid undergoing ideal hydrodynamic flow .",
    "the full quantum field theory is considered in section 4 , where we compute _ ab initio _ the spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "the full theory displays the same essential features as the toy model studied in section 3 , albeit the interplay of linearly growing low lying momentum modes and the resonant modes leads to a more complex temporal evolution . in this section",
    ", we also investigate the dependence of the relaxation time on the strength of the coupling constant .",
    "then , we study the energy distribution in a small subsystem , and its time evolution .",
    "we conclude with a brief outlook .",
    "much of the details of the computation are given in appendices .",
    "in appendix a , we discuss the numerical solution of the scalar field model , including the lattice discretization , the computation of the quantum fluctuation spectrum and the sensitivity of the results to the ultraviolet cut - off .",
    "the stability analysis of linearized perturbations to the classical field is considered in appendix b. the resonance band is identified and the lyapunov exponents are computed explicitly .",
    "we also discuss the relationship between decoherence and linear instabilities .",
    "in this section , we will consider a scalar field toy model whose behavior mimics key features of the glasma  @xcite description of the early behavior of the quark - gluon matter produced in high energy heavy ion collisions . in the cgc framework ,",
    "strong color fields are present in the initial conditions for the evolution of the glasma .",
    "in this situation , the leading order contribution is given by classical fields , with higher order corrections coming from the _ apparently _ sub - leading quantum fluctuations .",
    "we consider the stress - energy tensor in this scalar field model and discuss its temporal evolution at leading ( lo ) and next - to - leading orders ( nlo ) .",
    "we show explicitly that there are contributions at nlo that can grow with time and become larger than the lo terms .",
    "we end this section by describing how these `` secular '' terms can be resummed and the results expressed in terms of an average over a gaussian ensemble of classical fields .",
    "our cgc inspired scalar model has the lagrangean @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an external source . in the cgc framework ,",
    "the source @xmath13 coupled to the gauge fields represents the color charge current carried by the two colliding heavy ions .",
    "the current is zero at positive proper time , corresponding to times after the collision has taken place .",
    "we emulate this feature of the cgc in a simpler coordinate system by taking the source @xmath13 to be nonzero only for cartesian time @xmath14 , and parameterize it as to ensure a free theory in the remote past . ]",
    "@xmath15 at @xmath16 , where @xmath13 is zero , the fields evolve solely via their self - interactions , in an analogous fashion to the non - abelian color fields produced in the collision of two hadrons or nuclei .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) , we incorporated two additional features of the cgc .",
    "the first feature corresponds to a strong external current @xmath13 , which follows from the power of the inverse coupling when @xmath7 ; weak coupling is essential to motivate an expansion in powers of @xmath17 .",
    "the other feature of the cgc that is emulated is that the dimensionful parameter @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) plays a role analogous to that of the saturation scale  @xcite , in the sense that non - linear interactions are sizeable for modes @xmath19 .",
    "note that a scalar field theory with a @xmath0 coupling in four space - time dimensions is scale invariant at the classical level  the coupling constant @xmath20 is dimensionless in the theory . in our model",
    ", this scale invariance is broken by the coupling of the scalar field to the external source @xmath13 containing the dimensionful scale @xmath18 .",
    "we may therefore anticipate that all physical quantities are simply expressed by the appropriate power of @xmath18 times a prefactor that depends on @xmath20 .      because the source @xmath13 contains a power of the inverse coupling , the power counting for feynman diagrams indicates that the order of magnitude of a given graph depends only on its number of external lines and number of loops , but not on the number of sources @xmath13 attached to the graph  @xcite .",

    "this makes certain that none of the modes that exist on this lattice has an exponential instability .",

    "however , one can see in the figure [ fig : pressure2 ] that excluding the resonant modes leads to significant changes .",
    "the final outcome , the relaxation of the pressure towards @xmath130 , is not changed , but the details of the time evolution of the pressure are modified .",
