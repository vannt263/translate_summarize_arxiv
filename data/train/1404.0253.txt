    "the charge transport in fluids under confinements or around objects of nanometer length scale has been of growing interest in a lot of physical and biological systems @xcite ; for example , in the study of colloidal separation and self - assembly , nanoparticles at liquid - liquid interfaces , electrochemical energy devices and membrane ionic channels . when the length scale of confinements is comparable with the characteristic lengths of electrolytes ( e.g. , the bjerrum length of the solvent @xmath0 , and the debye length of the electrolyte @xmath1 ) , complex electrostatic phenomena such as the charge inversion and the like - charge attraction have been often observed experimentally .",
    "these phenomena are beyond mean - field theoretical explanations and motivate many challenges to computational and modelling communities @xcite .    in the vicinity of a charged surface ,",
    "counterions are attracted , forming a screening region called electric double layer .",
    "the structure of the double layer plays a key role in nanoscale interface sciences @xcite .",
    "the ions in the external diffuse layer is coulombic , where the electric potential decays exponentially with the characteristic debye length .",
    "the ions in the internal stern layer are condensed , where the electric potential does not obey the exponential rule due to the tangential ion correlation and other short - range interactions .",
    "if the medium contacting the electrolyte is a dielectric of low permittivity , the dielectric mismatch leads to an induced - charge potential , repelling the counterions and thus creating a depletion zone near the surface",
    ". this effect could play an important role in many phenomena of nanoscale systems , and is also attracting much attention in theoretical and simulation study ( see @xcite to mention a few recent literature ) .    in the mean - field description of ion structure and transport in the double layer , the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) and poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) theories have been considered .",
    "the pnp is beyond the pb because the pnp describes the charge dynamics and thus has been widely used for studying ion transport in nanopores and nanochannels ; for example , open ion channels in cell membranes @xcite .",
    "the system of equations has also been widely applied in continuum theories of narrow channels by coupling with the stokes equations to model nanofluidics @xcite .",
    "the pnp equations are also known as  drift - diffusion equations \" and have much use in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "asymptotic analysis on the pnp equations has been made to understand properties of charge diffusion of electrochemical energy systems @xcite . from the aspect of numerical analysis ,",
    "various numerical methods have been proposed @xcite to solve the nonlinear equations more accurately and efficiently and to capture specific dynamical behaviors of the non - equilibrium system .",
    "the classical pnp theory neglects the ion - ion correlation , excluded volume and image charge effects in the double layer , significantly changing the local structure and the far - field properties of electrolytes .",
    "when large surface charges or applied potentials are involved , the nonmonotonic differential capacitance of electrodes can not be predicted without these effects @xcite .",
    "analysis of current - concentration curves @xcite also showed significantly different trends between the experimental data @xcite and that predicted by the pnp theory .",
    "moreover , it has been found that the mean - field theory fails in explaining , even qualitatively , phenomena of the long range attractions between two surfaces in electrolyte @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the pnp theory and particle - based brownian dynamics simulations @xcite for cylindrical pores of varying sizes demonstrated the invalidity of the mean - field theories when the cylindrical radius is less than @xmath2 , evidencing that the aforementioned effects should be accounted for in the continuum modeling .",
    "different versions of modified pb / pnp theory have been proposed by including such as steric effects @xcite or the dielectric self energy @xcite .",
    "a useful approach of remedying the mean - field theory is to replace the mean potential by a better approximation of the potential of mean force , i.e. , to include the ignored effects by correcting the mean potential by the self energy of mobile ions .",
    "the remedy to modify the mean potential may improve the mean - field theory a lot by including ionic correlations and image charges to capture many - body physics ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the shortcoming is that the self energy is very difficult to obtain , either by molecular dynamics simulations or by solving high - dimensional equations from field - theory calculations . in this work ,",
    "we follow the idea of gaussian variational field theory @xcite which models the self energy as the self - green s function .",
    "a self - energy modified pnp model is derived ( sec .",
    "ii ) and the green s function is described by the generalized debye - hckel ( dh ) equation nonlinearly depending on the mean ion distributions .",
    "the resulted system of partial differential equations is then composed of three equations : the nernst - planck equations for the dynamics of charges , the poisson equation for the mean potential , and the generalized dh equation for the green s function .",
    "the self energy is solved efficiently by some analytical and numerical approximations , and then the modified pnp equations are solved by finite difference algorithm .    in section iii , we discuss the dimensionless formulation of the modified pnp equations , by introducing two ratios of length scales , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the characteristic length of confinements .",
    "then we developed the analytical wkb ( wentzel - kramers - brillouin ) approximation and the numerical finite - difference approximation for the dh equation .",
    "the wkb approach attempts to express the self energy as an explicit formula by asymptotic approximation assuming the parameter @xmath6 is small .",
    "the finite - difference numerical method is more expensive , but can be tackled by using selective inversion for sparse symmetric and positive definite matrix . in section 4 ,",
    "our numerical results show the wkb approximation is in a good agreement with the difference method when @xmath5 is bigger than a few bjerrum lengths .",
    "this is a positive evidence that the use of the wkb approximation gives a satisfactory accuracy in the self - energy calculation , while avoiding expensive high - dimensional numerical calculations .",
    "our numerical examples place much focus on the dielectric effect of electrodes .",
    "this effect is believed to be important in many systems as aforementioned , and may play important role in many - body interaction between colloids @xcite .",
    "certainly , electrostatic interaction at solid - liquid interfaces is much more complex than the simplified picture .",
    "one important effect is the variable dielectric permittivity of solvent , which has been found to capture many key phenomena observed experimentally @xcite",
    ". the modified pnp model does include the treatment of this effect with varying dielectric constant and excluded volumes of test ions by the dh equation ; eq . below .",
    "this treatment will highly increase the computational cost compared with the present model , thus , we remain our model here for a dielectrically homogeneous electrolyte bounded by sharp interfaces .",
    "the transport of charged particles in an electrolyte is often described by the nernst - planck equation ( also called the smoluchowski equation ) which states that the time derivative of the ion density function is composed of a diffusion contribution and an advection contribution due to the potential energy @xmath7 of the ions , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the concentration of the ions of species @xmath10 , @xmath11 is its diffusion constant , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath14 is the temperature .    in the mean - field description of electrostatics , the potential energy @xmath7 takes the mean potential energy @xmath15 , and the electric potential @xmath16 is governed by the poisson equation , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the valence , @xmath19 is the fixed charge , @xmath20 is the vacuum dielectric permittivity and @xmath21 is the relative dielectric permittivity of the medium .",
    "the coupling system between the nernst - planck equation and the poisson equation is called the poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) equations .",
    "the mean - field nature of the pnp ignores the induced - charge effect ( or image - charge effect ) of dielectric discontinuity and many - body ion correlation , which plays an important role in a lot of electrostatic phenomena . even at the weak - coupling limit ,",
    "the induced - charge effect is significant and should be taken into account . in order to include these effects , the potential energy of transported particles @xmath7 can be expressed as the mean potential energy plus a correction , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the self energy of a unit test ion of the @xmath10th transported species . given the mean potential @xmath16 , an accurate description of @xmath23 is to include all many - body interaction with the test ion , i.e. , the potential of mean force , which for example can be done by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , or by a reaction - field formulation @xcite . in the self - consistent gaussian field approximation @xcite",
    ", this quantity can be defined through a green s function @xmath24 , described by the generalized debye - hckel ( dh ) equation , @xmath25 and @xmath23 is then the self green s function limit , @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the green s function in free space to remove the invariable singularity , and @xmath28 is the local ionic strength , which describes the screening effect by the surrounding ions of the test ion , and where the ionic concentrations are determined by the nernst - planck equation .",
    "the prime in the permittivity function @xmath29 describes the function has been locally modified due to the excluded volume of the test ion , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ionic radius , and @xmath32 is the effective dielectric permittivity inside the ionic cavity .",
    "we see the ionic size effect is taken into account by assuming that the ionic cavity is inaccessible to mobile ions . consequently , in eq . , @xmath28 is expressed as , @xmath33 this modification is particularly useful to remove the self - energy singularity when the permittivity of solvent is space - dependent @xcite , but greatly increases numerical difficulty . to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we will not discuss this size effect in this work , and simply take the limit @xmath34 , and leave the algorithm development for a future study .    in equilibrium",
    ", the zero ion flux of each species leads to the following equality , @xmath35 solving this equation gives an explicit formula for the equilibrium ion density , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is constant determined by the chemical potential .",
    "substituting the expression into the right side of the poisson equation , we obtain a modified poisson - boltzmann equation , @xmath38 together with the generalized dh equation , it has been studied by avdeev and martynov @xcite using the debye closure of the bbgky chain , netz and orland @xcite using gaussian variational field theory , and in much recent work ( see @xcite to mention a few ) .",
    "in order to understand the self - energy effects for the charge transport , we consider an electrolyte with 1:1 salt between two parallel planar electrodes at @xmath39 ( see fig . [ fig : schem ] ) , which is a simple model of electrochemical systems .",
    "we study the case of sharp dielectric permittivity @xmath40 which takes the water permittivity @xmath41 for @xmath42 with a small @xmath43 , and the alternative value @xmath44 for the electrodes outside .",
    "the use of a small separation between the dielectric interface and the electrode avoids the self - energy divergence near the boundary .",
    "the sharp interfaces remain , providing the induced - charge effect to the mobile ions in the electrolyte .",
    ", the coefficient @xmath45 and the mobile ions near the interfaces are repelled by image charges . ]",
    "let @xmath46 be the bjerrum length at the water solvent , at which distance the interaction energy of two unit point charges is @xmath47 .",
    "we take @xmath5 as the reference length scale , @xmath48 as a typical diffusion constant , and @xmath49 as a typical ion condensation .",
    "we assume ions have uniform diffusion constant and define the another length scale @xmath50 .",
    "we note , when @xmath49 is the bulk ion concentration for symmetric monovalent salt , @xmath1 is the debye screening length .      the nernst - planck and the poisson equations are defined on a finite interval @xmath63 , while the generalized dh equation is defined on the whole three - dimensional domain with implied interface conditions at @xmath64 .",
    "we assume completely blocking electrodes @xcite imposed with a time - varying external potential , @xmath65 in dimensionless unit , on the electrodes .",
    "then , at @xmath66 , the ionic fluxes should vanish and the electric potential is a fixed time function .",
    "this boundary condition leads to a global zero flux at the steady state , i.e. , the equilibrium solution .",
    "the current - voltage relations for channel problems correspond to different boundary conditions and will be explored in a future publication under the self - energy modified pnp model . concerning the generalized dh equation , the green s function should be solved in an infinite domain , i.e. , the decaying boundary condition .",
    "therefore , we have the following boundary conditions for concentrations , potential and the green s function , @xmath67 in this work , we take @xmath68 to use the dirichlet condition for the potential . the robin boundary condition , i.e. , @xmath69 , is often used to account for the dielectric electrodes in literature @xcite by considering the tight counterion adsorption at the stern layer . in the green s function equation ,",
    "the dielectric permittivity is discontinuous at interfaces at @xmath64 .",
    "we find as a result of using a positive @xmath70 , the higher - order singularity of the self energy can be removed when @xmath71 .",
    "the dimensionless dielectric permittivity is then @xmath72 for @xmath73 , and @xmath74 elsewhere .",
    "initially , it is assumed that the ions are in equilibrium without applying the external potential which starts to function at @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , we can set constant initial ionic concentrations , @xmath76 , under electric - neutral constraint @xmath77 . for monovalent salt we are studying , @xmath78 for @xmath79 and 2 .",
    "in addition , we assume there is no fixed charge @xmath80 in the system , though fixed charges play important roles in many biological and nanofluidic devices .",
    "now we have completed initial and boundary conditions for the pnp model .",
    "the system properties are determined by the ionic species , the applied external potential , and the ratios of length scales @xmath6 and @xmath62 .",
    "the nernst - planck and the poisson equations are approximated by finite - difference discretizations .",
    "let @xmath81 and @xmath82 be the time and space steps , and denote the @xmath83th time and @xmath84th space grids by @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the second - order semi - implicit time - stepping scheme is employed for the nernst - planck equation , @xmath87,\\ ] ] where @xmath88 and @xmath89 here the scheme of diffusion term is a central difference , and that of the advection term is an extrapolation for approximating @xmath90 . by this discretization",
    ", we gain the second - order accuracy in time and the benefit of avoiding nonlinear iterations thanks to the use of the explicit approximation for the nonlinear advection coefficient .",
    "the stability condition mainly depends on the implicitly - discretized diffusion term , and thus the grid sizes can be @xmath91 . since it is a three - point scheme in time , we should use the backward scheme for @xmath7 at the initial step @xmath92 .    concerning the spatial discretization ,",
    "because the dielectric function @xmath72 is constant in interval @xmath63 and the ionic concentrations are smooth , we could rewrite the advection term as @xmath93 .",
    "standard three - point central differences are used for the first and the second space derivatives of @xmath9 and @xmath7 for the internal points . in discretizing the boundary conditions , two ghost points outside the boundaries",
    "are introduced to obtain second - order central approximations .",
    "for the poisson equation with given @xmath94 , the mean potential at @xmath95th time step can be simply obtained by central discretization with the boundary condition .",
    "different from the nernst - planck and the poisson equations , the discretization for the generalized dh equation is not trivial .",
    "we rewrite the generalized dh equation as a space - dependent - coefficient form , which is required to solve in each time step , @xmath96 where the generalized inverse debye length , @xmath97 between two interfaces and zero otherwise . here",
    "we set @xmath98 without loss of generality .",
    "solving this equation gives the green s function at time @xmath99 .",
    "this equation is more difficult due to higher dimensions of the green s function .",
    "we will introduce two approaches .",
    "the wkb approximation is often adopted to find approximate green s function in the presence of electrolytes and interfaces due to its analytical nature @xcite , which avoids numerical solution of the high - dimensional problem .",
    "we propose a simple wkb expression by improving the idea of buff and stillinger @xcite which has been used recently for studying the double layer interaction by wang and wang @xcite .",
    "this approach results in an explicit formula of the self energy with clear physical significance . in the second approach",
    "we propose a numerical approximation with finite difference , which could reach any desired accuracy by varying the grid sizes , and so we limit the use of wkb to a pure analytical formulation .",
    "the wkb formulation is derived from the perturbative expansion with small @xmath101 , and is also accurate for large @xmath101 because the strong screening leads to weak image potentials .",
    "thus the formulation is aysmptotically exact for both small and large @xmath101 limits . for the intermediate @xmath101 ,",
    "the wkb approximation can be considered as an interpolation of the two limits , which , however , may produce poor prediction for the self energy of ions near the interfaces due to inaccurate estimation of the local contribution @xmath120 . in the following ,",
    "we propose an improved approximation .",
    "we remain the form of the image charge series , but modifying the local contribution @xmath121 by the similar technique of born series ( truncated at the first order ) widely known in the field of quantum scattering .",
    "consider the following two green s functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 which satisfy , @xmath124 let @xmath125 , then @xmath126 can be approximately , @xmath127 subtracting eq .",
    "by eq . , we have the following approximate equation for @xmath128 , @xmath129 where in the right side the assumption @xmath130 is applied by considering @xmath131 is a perturbation of @xmath132 .",
    "the numerical solution of the green s function is usually difficult due to high dimensionality ",
    "it is a function of both the source and field coordinates .",
    "we will use the properties of the geometric symmetry of the considered system and only the self green s function being required .",
    "these two properties allow us to develop very efficient solver to get the self energy , which has been coupled with the modified poisson - boltzmann equation to simulate equilibrium charged systems @xcite .",
    "we briefly overview the algorithm below .    in order to reduce the dimensions ,",
    "the polar symmetric fourier transform with respect to @xmath153 and @xmath154 is first applied .",
    "let @xmath155 and @xmath156 be the frequency correspondences of @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and let @xmath159 be the frequency .",
    "the fourier transform of the generalized dh equation is a two - dimensional equation of @xmath110 and @xmath111 for each @xmath159 , @xmath160 \\widehat{g}(\\omega ; x , x ' ) = 2 \\delta(x - x ' ) .",

    "then the image and correlation self energy is given by the inverse fourier transform , @xmath164 \\omega d\\omega , \\label{integ}\\ ] ] where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are diagonal elements of the approximate frequency green s functions .",
    "this equation is approximated by numerical integration .",
    "we remark that the direct inversion of a matrix is expensive , and we should apply some sparse inversion technique to find the diagonals of an inverse matrix ; for literature , see @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present numerical results by performing calculations of monovalent electrolytes .",
    "two species of ions with valence @xmath167 are included , and initially the dimensionless ion densities set @xmath168 .",
    "the separation between the dielectric interface and the boundary takes @xmath169 , and thus @xmath170 . in all calculations ,",
    "the parameters @xmath171 and electrode voltage @xmath172 ( correspondingly , @xmath173 ) are fixed , and different strengths of @xmath62 and @xmath74 are investigated . since the debye length @xmath1 ( typically , @xmath174 ) is the characteristic thickness of the electric double layer , this choice of @xmath6 does not introduce much interaction between two double layers and continuum theory is thus considered adequate to describe the charge dynamics @xcite , and we will see that introducing self - energy contribution significantly modifies the system quantities at the length scale .    the wkb and finite - difference numerical approaches for the generalized dh equation are compared .",
    "since we have two wkb approaches , we label the results of different approaches by  wkb1 \" ,",
    " wkb2 \" and  fdm \" , where wkb1 is based on expression and wkb2 is the improved version eq . .",
    "also we present the results of classical pnp , denoted by  pnp \" ( corresponding to @xmath175 ) , to show the difference between the pnp and the modified model . the image charge series in wkb formulations are truncated at @xmath176 , large enough to ensure that the truncation error is negligible . in fdm approximation , the infinite integral eq .",

    "we take @xmath181 , @xmath182 and 16 quadrature points in the calculations .",
    "these parameters provide high accuracy for the integration .      in the first example",
    ", numerical schemes for the modified pnp equations with both the wkb and fdm approximations are tested .",
    "we set the parameter @xmath183 and the dielectric ratio @xmath184 , and compute the results up to time @xmath185 . for a water solvent at room temperature , @xmath186 and @xmath187",

    "this choice of big @xmath62 is convenient to observe the convergence of the schemes .",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath189 is typical for membranes or other materials .",
    "the time step takes @xmath190 with varying space grid sizes @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "[ fig : accuracy ] presents the results of the spatial distribution of the net charge density , @xmath193 , with the three approaches and the four grid sizes .",

    ", it is observed that the error is also decreased in a factor of @xmath197 if @xmath82 is halved , demonstrating all approaches are self - convergent with the second - order accuracy .",
    "the three approaches all predict a non - monotonic curves near the interfaces . near the cathode",

    "this is due to @xmath199 thus the self - image charges repel the mobile ions , and in agreement with monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the pnp ignores the polarization effect , and thus always predicts monotonic net charge density ( shown in next section ) . by comparing the three approaches , the charge density predicted from the wkb1 is much higher than those from the fdm and the wkb2 .",

    "[ fig : accuracy ] ( a)-(c ) are 1.54 , 1.32 , and 1.30 , respectively . as the fdm with the fine mesh",

    "the solution may blow up at a certain time without including the excluded volume effect .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a modified pnp model by coupling the pnp equation with the generalized dh equation and developed efficient wkb and numerical methods for the self energy .",

    "it has been investigated through simulations that image charges are involved in many many - body phenomena such as charge inversion @xcite and like - charge attraction @xcite .",
    "we show that the modified model can correctly predict the image - charge effect on dynamics of mobile ions .",
    "however , this work does not pay much attention on the ion - ion correlation , though this effect has been included in the modified pnp model .",
    "it is due to that the ion correlation should take into account the size effect of ions , which gives rise to a high difficulty in numerical implementation . without accounting for the ion size effect ,",
    "the solution of the modified pnp equation is unstable with the increase of applied surface voltages .",
    "the issue of overcoming this challenge is certainly our objective of future work .",

    "<S> we find that , at the length scale of the interface separation comparable to the bjerrum length , the results of the modified equations are significantly different from the classical pnp predictions mostly due to the dielectric effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that when the ion self energy is in weak or mediate strength , the wkb approximation presents a high accuracy , compared to precise finite - difference results . </S>"
