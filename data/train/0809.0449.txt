    "it is well known that there is a remarkable connection between the statistical properties of certain random hermitian matrices , the zeros of the riemann zeta function , and fermionic gases @xcite .",
    "underlying each of these objects are certain one - dimensional point processes ( defined more precisely in section 2 ) whose statistical properties ( under certain limits ) are believed to be identical .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide generalizations of this unique point process to point processes in @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 for any @xmath1 , and to characterize their spatial statistics exactly .",
    "since the characterization of a point process can be viewed as the study of a system of interacting  point \" particles , exact descriptions of nontrivial point processes in arbitrary space dimension , which are hard to come by @xcite , are of great value in the field of statistical mechanics .",
    "there are three prominent theories of random hermitian matrices , which model the hamiltonians of certain random dynamical systems ; see the excellent book by mehta @xcite . if the dynamical system is symmetric under time reversal , then the relevant theory for integral spin is that of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) or the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) for half - integer spin . on the other hand , the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) models random hamiltonians without time reversal symmetry , which is relevant to certain properties of the riemann zeta function .",
    "although there are distinct one - dimensional point processes associated with each of these ensembles , our interest here will be in the gue because of its relationship to the riemann zeta function .",
    "the gue of degree @xmath14 consists of the set of all @xmath15 hermitian matrices together with a haar measure .",
    "this is the unique probability measure on the set of @xmath15 hermitian matrices that is invariant under conjugation by unitary matrices such that the individual matrix entries are independent random variables .",
    "dyson @xcite showed that the eigenvalue distrubutions of the gue are closely related to those of the  circular unitary ensemble \" ( cue ) , which he exactly mapped into a problem of point particles on a unit circle interacting with a two - dimensional coulombic force law at a particular temperature .",
    "this point process on the unit circle or , equivalently , on the real line @xmath0 in the large-@xmath14 limit ( when suitably normalized ) has a pair correlation function ( defined in section 2 ) in @xmath0 at number density @xmath16 given by @xmath17 equation also applies for the gue in the limit @xmath18 such that the mean gap distance between eigenvalues at the origin is normalized ; this limit has the effect of magnifying the bulk of the eigenvalue density on @xmath0 such that is well - defined .",
    "we see that this point process is always _ negatively correlated _ , i.e. , @xmath7 never exceeds unity ( see fig .",
    "[ zeta - zero ] ) and is  repulsive \" in the sense that @xmath19 as @xmath9 tends to zero . more generally , dyson @xcite proved that the @xmath3-particle correlation function ( defined in section 2 ) is given by the following determinant : @xmath20    montgomery @xcite conjectured that the pair correlation function of nontrivial zeros of the riemann zeta function ( which , according to the riemann hypothesis , lie along the critical line @xmath21 with @xmath22 ) is given exactly by the gue / cue function ( [ g2-zeros ] ) in the asymptotic limit ( high on the critical line ) when appropriately normalized .",
    "this remarkable correspondence was further established by odlyzko @xcite , who numerically verified the riemann hypothesis for the first @xmath23 nontrivial zeros of the zeta function as well as at much larger heights and confirmed that the pair correlation function agrees with ( [ g2-zeros ] ) .",
    "rudnick and sarnak @xcite proved that , under the riemann hypothesis , the nontrivial zeros have @xmath3-particle densities for any @xmath3 given by ( [ gn - zeros ] ) .",
    "the reader is referred to the excellent review article by katz and sarnak @xcite , which discusses the connection between the zeros of zeta functions and classical symmetric groups , of which the three canonical random - matrix ensembles are but special cases .    for spin - polarized free fermions in @xmath0 ( fermion gas ) at number density @xmath16 , it is known that the pair correlation function in the _ ground state _ ( i.e. , completely filling the fermi  sphere \" ) is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fermi radius , which is the one - dimensional analog of the well - known three - dimensional result @xcite .",

    "such a dominant power - law decay of @xmath7 is a well - known property of bosonic systems in their ground states @xcite and , more recently , has been shown to characterize maximally random jammed sphere packings @xcite .",
    "realizations of the point processes are displayed in one and two dimensions , using a simulation technique described by us elsewhere @xcite , which vividly reveal their  repulsive \" nature .",
    "in fact , we show the point processes can be characterized by an effective  hard - core \" diameter that grows like the square root of @xmath1 .",
