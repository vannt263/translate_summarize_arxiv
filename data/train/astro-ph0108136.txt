    "this paper tries to understand whether concentrations of emission in observations of position - velocity space represent real clumps of gas in molecular clouds ; whether the properties inferred for the observed objects describe the actual clouds ; and what we can say about the mechanisms that drive interstellar turbulence by observing molecular clouds with different tracers .",
    "several papers have tried to address these points before .",
    "@xcite show that , in a galactic disk model , gas complexes in a longitude - velocity diagram do not necessarily correspond to real complexes .",
    "more recently , based on numerical simulations , @xcite showed that observed clumps frequently come from the superposition of several physically disconnected regions in the line of sight at the same radial velocity ( see also @xcite , ) but not necessarily at the same three - dimensional velocity .",
    "moreover , the morphology seen in observed position - position - velocity maps seems to be more representative of the spatial distribution of the velocity field in the line of sight than of the distribution of the density field , as has been shown in 3d numerical simulations by @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite shown that only the velocity field is responsible for the structure existing in the channel maps of observational data cubes .",
    "if observed structures do not match actual structures , it is valid to ask whether statistical properties of observed clouds , such as the @xcite relationships , are still valid for actual clouds .",
    "as @xcite mentions , they may instead be artifacts of the observations .",
    "in fact , @xcite argues that the mean density - size relationship is an artifact of the limited dynamical range of the observations ( see also @xcite . ) @xcite used two - dimensional simulations of the diffuse interstellar medium to suggest that there is no relationship between mean density and size of physical clouds ( defined as a connected set of pixels in their simulations ) , but that there is a relationship , although with strong scatter , between the velocity dispersion and size , a result confirmed by @xcite .",
    "although as we mentioned , several papers have studied the same questions as the present paper , they addressed them only partially , studying for example only objects in physical space @xcite , or in observational space @xcite ; or giving physical arguments to explain the observed @xcite relationships ( e.g. , @xcite itself ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we use three - dimensional numerical models of molecular clouds to directly compare structures in simulated observations to the actual physical structures that produce them .",
    "our goals are : to give observational predictions about the nature of the sources of the turbulence ; to disentangle what observed properties are representative of the true physical entities ; and what are more likely to just be the result of superposition of multiple structures along the line of sight . another way of asking this is , what are the differences between the observational space and the physical space ?",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in  [ simulationssec ] we describe the numerical models used here , and the methods used to define clumps and to generate simulated observations from model density and velocity cubes . in ",
    "[ role ] we study the role of the luminosity @xmath0 , wavenumber @xmath1 and initial magnetic field @xmath2 in the production of density fluctuations , and give observational criteria to infer the properties of the sources of turbulence .",
    "we discuss the superposition effects , and analyze the relative importance of the parameters of the simulations in the superposition effects (  [ superposition ] ) .",
    "section  [ larsonsec ] studies larson s relations ( mean density vs.  size , velocity dispersion vs.  size and mass spectrum ) and discusses the importance of each one of them , by comparing physical and observational space , and  [ summary ] draws the main conclusions .",
    "in the present work we analyze driven , supersonic , hydro- and magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) models described by @xcite .",
    "details of the models and forcing can be found there .",
    "here we just mention that the models are solutions of the mass , momentum and induction equations using zeus-3d @xcite at a resolution of @xmath3 and @xmath4 zones .",
    "they include periodic boundary conditions in each direction and an isothermal equation of state , implying that the simulations are scale free .",
    "they are forced at a characteristic scale given by the wavenumber @xmath1 and at a constant energy injection rate @xmath0 , with an initial magnetic field intensity @xmath2 .",
    "table [ simulations ] shows the parameters of those simulations .",
    "the first column shows the name of the run , following the notation in @xcite of the alfvn velocity to the sound speed , with x representing 10 . ] in columns 2 , 3 and 4 we show the driving luminosity , wavenumber and initial intensity of the magnetic field intensities .",
    "column 5 shows the value of the root mean square of the density fluctuations @xmath5^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    these simulations were performed to model the interior structure of molecular clouds , at scales of 0.01 - 1  pc , densities of @xmath6  cm3 , and temperatures of @xmath7  k. under these conditions , the isothermal equation of state is a reasonable approximation to the full thermodynamics of the cloud .",
    "other works focussing on larger scales ( 10 - 1000  pc ) have explicitly included heating and cooling , a star formation scheme , and so forth @xcite , but these are not necessary to study the scales we are concerned with .",
    "a bigger omission in our simulations is the lack of self - gravity , which will play a role in the production of dense cores @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we find the non - self - gravitating simulations useful to study superposition effects , and their consequences in the statistical properties observed for clumps .",
    "even more , since our results are consistent with other works that include self - gravity , we conclude that its lack in our simulations is not relevant for the conclusions stressed here .",
    "a similar conclusion has recently been reached by @xcite , who studied wavelet transforms of self - gravitating mhd turbulence and found that the overall structure was decoupled from that of the densest cores .",
    "we analyze the numerical data first by analyzing the physical variables such as density , velocity , and magnetic fields themselves , and second by simulating observations of the models . in previous work @xcite",
    "we represented the line profiles of the simulations as histograms of the velocity weighted by density .",
    "however , those line profiles did not include the effect of temperature in broadening the profiles , and did not account for optical depth effects .",
    "therefore we calculate the radiative transfer here , assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) for the population of the molecular energy levels , which is a sufficiently good approximation to study qualitatively the effects of projection and superposition ( velocity crowding ) of structure in the cloud . in order to model differences",
    "when observing the same region with different tracers , we took into account that at low densities the molecules will be underexcited . to do this",
    "we made the very simple assumption that the lines are excited only if the density is above 650  cm3 for the @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) transition , 6200  cm3 for @xmath8co(2 - 1 ) , and 1.8@xmath94 for cs(1 - 0 ) @xcite .",
    "in other words , we assume lte if the local density is larger or equal to these density thresholds for each transition .    because the simulations are scale - free , the units of density , temperature and length are arbitrary , but the included physics is adequate to represent the behavior of molecular gas with length scales between thousands of astronomical units for the densest cores , up to several parsecs . for the construction of the @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) ,",
    "( 2 - 1 ) and cs(1 - 0 ) line profiles , we adopted solar abundances ; and typical scales for the density and length of @xmath10  cm3 and @xmath11  pc , respectively . since the simulations are isothermal , we choose the temperature equal to 10  k. these choices produce regions that are mostly optically thin in both @xmath8co  and cs .    in the production of line profiles",
    ", we fixed the number of velocity channels at 32 .",
    "this choice results in a velocity resolution of 0.06  km  s@xmath12  for the less energetic simulations , and of 0.2  km  s@xmath12  for the more energetic cases .",
    "these resolutions are comparable to the velocity resolution of typical observations of molecular clouds at fcrao which is 0.08  km  s@xmath12 , or in large - scale surveys like the full galactic co survey by @xcite which reaches resolutions as high as 0.26  km  s@xmath12 .    since we know the detailed density and velocity distribution , and assume a constant temperature , in order to determine the emission from any given molecular transition we just have to integrate the corresponding transfer equation , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the intensity",
    "; @xmath15 is the source function , which we assume to be a blackbody at @xmath16  k ; @xmath17 is the distance along the ray ; and @xmath18 is the mass absorption coefficient of the line , and has units of [ @xmath19 gr@xmath12 ] . in order to integrate equation ( [ transfer ] ) along the line of sight we solve , in practice , the following equations : @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the background intensity and @xmath24 is the total optical depth of the cloud , and @xmath25 is the local mass density . since the models have constant elements of volume ( zones )",
    ", the integration over @xmath26 becomes a summation with constant step equal to the zone size .",
    "the absorption coefficient @xmath18 is _",
    "= a_ij c^28 ^ 2 g_ig_j ( v ) [ kappa ] where @xmath27 is the einstein coefficient for the @xmath28 transition if the density is larger than the threshold density for excitation , and zero if the density is smaller ; @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the statistical weights of the upper and lower states respectively ; @xmath31 is the numerical density of molecules in the lower state ; and @xmath32 is the line profile , which is assumed to be thermal .",
    "these last two parameters take the form n_j = g_j q^-1 , and ( v)=c(m_mol2kt)^1/2 ( -m_mol ( v - v_0)^22kt ) , where @xmath33 is the mean molecular mass of the gas ( assumed to be 2.5 times the mass of the hydrogen atom ) , @xmath34 is the mass of the emitting molecule , @xmath35 is its molecular abundance relative to the hydrogen ( assumed to be solar ) , @xmath36 is the partition function , and @xmath37 is the velocity of the zone , which is known .",
    "the molecular parameters are given in table  [ molecules ]      in order to represent and compare the physical and observational spaces in two - dimensional plots we integrate over one of the dimensions .",
    "in particular , when we integrate in the @xmath38 direction the physical space , the corresponding observational cube is integrated in the @xmath39 direction .",
    "this will allow us to compare , whether a clump in a position - velocity diagram has a counterpart in the position - position diagram .",
    "then , when we label a plot as @xmath40 or @xmath41 , we show the column density field integrated in the @xmath42 direction , after zeroing all those points where the density is smaller than the density threshold ( see table [ molecules ] . )",
    "the corresponding observational plot will be @xmath43 or @xmath44 respectively , and then represents the simulated observation of the @xmath45 map as seen by an observer located at the left of the plot , assuming @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) or @xmath8co(2 - 1 ) emission as described above .",
    "the first problem that appears when we study the properties of clouds and clumps is how to define them .",
    "for instance , if we are interested in studying large complexes and their substructure , we define a complex as a connected set of points with intensity above an arbitrary threshold @xcite .",
    "when we work in physical space , the `` intensity '' is the actual density .",
    "if we work in the observational space , the `` intensity '' is the brightness temperature . if instead , we are interested in studying individual clumps , we define a clump as a connected set of points below a local maximum following the intensity _ only _ downwards until the threshold is reached",
    ". this scheme has been implemented by @xcite in a code called clumpfind .",
    "a single large cloud with internal structure in the first scheme may be counted as several smaller clumps in the second scheme .",
    "other schemes are also used .",
    "for example , one can assume that clumps have a gaussian distribution of intensity @xcite , so that a clump defined as single by clumpfind  can be decomposed into several gaussian substructures .    in the present work we will use clumpfindfor simplicity .",
    "differences between methods will be discussed in future contributions , but it is worth noting that , as @xcite has shown , these methods can not identify clumps larger than a few resolution elements .",
    "we analyze how the parameters of the simulations ( driving strength and wavelength , magnetic field strength ) affect the structure in both observational and physical space . in particular , we attempt to give observational criteria to help determine the equivalent parameters of the physical mechanism driving the observed turbulence .",
    "we begin by comparing models with the same driving wavenumber and magnetic field , but different driving strengths . in table  [ simulations ] we see that the larger the driving strength @xmath0 , the larger the density fluctuations .",
    "this occurs because the rms mach number in the simulations depends on the driving strength and the wavenumber as @xmath46 @xcite , and the density contrast across an isothermal shock depends on the mach number as @xmath47 .",
    "figure  [ maps_l ] shows maps of both the physical column density and the observed emission for two hydrodynamical models with the same wavenumber ( @xmath48 ) , but driving strength different by a factor of 100 : model ha8 ( @xmath49 ) and model he8 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the main difference between these extreme cases is that ha8 has larger column densities of low - density tracers , and lower column densities of high - density tracers .",
    "another clear difference is that in high - density tracers ha8 shows well - separated , roundish cores , while he8 shows a more filamentary structure with few compact cores .",
    "these differences can be understood as follows . when the turbulence is weakly driven ( ha8 ) ,",
    "density fluctuations are small .",
    "there will be few regions with density below the density threshold for the low density tracer ( @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) ) , so most of the cube will emit in that line , but conversely only a few places will have densities higher than the threshold for the high - density tracer ( @xmath8co(2 - 1 ) ) , so only a small column density is seen in that line .",
    "conversely , for strong driving ( he8 ) , the fluctuations around the mean are larger , and more regions will have densities either below the threshold for @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) or above the threshold for @xmath8co(2 - 1 ) , so that the mean column density for @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) is lower , but the mean column density for @xmath8co(2 - 1 ) is larger .",
    "stronger driving leads not just to higher densities , but more extreme fluctuations , as indicated by a greater fraction of material at both high and low densities . since structures in the simulations are produced by the convergence of turbulent flows , the smaller the driving wavenumber , the larger the dominant structures .",
    "we can see this effect in figure  [ maps_k ] , where we show four maps for hc2 and four maps for hc8 , both with the same driving strength ( @xmath51 ) , but different wavenumber ( @xmath52 and  8 respectively ) . from these plots",
    "we can see that the density structure is more homogeneously distributed in the case of high wavenumbers ( hc8 ) , in both physical and observational spaces . on larger scales , this suggests that _ large molecular clouds might be the result of turbulence driven at large scales in the diffuse interstellar gas ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and not the agglomeration of small clouds by the action of the self - gravity _ , as in some models of molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite )    the effect of magnetic fields in our models is consistent with previous work using simulations of the diffuse interstellar medium by @xcite , who showed that weak magnetic fields decrease the size of the density fluctuations compared to the hydrodynamic case . for intermediate magnetic fields ,",
    "the density fluctuations may increase above the hydrodynamic and weak field cases , and finally , for very strong magnetic fields , the density fluctuations decrease again .",
    "( the actual diagnostic they used , as shown in their fig .",
    "8 , is the star formation rate as a function of the magnetic field strength ; but in their scheme the star formation rate depends directly on the size of the density fluctuations ) .    in figure  [ magnetic ]",
    "we demonstrate this behavior .",
    "the simulations used have intermediate driving strength ( @xmath51 ) and wavenumber ( @xmath53 ) , and three different initial magnetic field strengths of @xmath54 ( hc4 ) , @xmath55 ( mc41 ) , @xmath56 ( mc45 ) .",
    "we can understand the dependence of the density fluctuations on the magnetic field strength as follows : weak magnetic fields are strongly tangled by the flow , so that they have a nearly isotropic magnetic pressure that prevents compressions and large density fluctuations , while stronger fields have an anisotropic magnetic pressure that allows larger compressions along the mean field lines , and thus larger density fluctuations .",
    "magnetic fields do not noticeably affect the structure of the maps unless they are strong enough to introduce some anisotropy .",
    "for example , in figure  [ maps_b_10 ] we show @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) maps of three different simulations , integrated parallel ( @xmath39 ) , and perpendicular ( @xmath38 ) to the initial field direction . from bottom to top , the relative importance of the magnetic field compared to the luminosity of the simulation increases .",
    "we show : me21 ( large driving strength , small wavenumber and small magnetic field ) ; ma81 ( low driving strength , large wavenumber and small magnetic field ) ; and ma4x ( small driving strength , intermediate wavenumber and large magnetic field ) .",
    "only the strong field case ma4x ( top panels ) shows a morphology different than the hydrodynamic case . in this case , a marked anisotropy is visible , with the projection perpendicular to the magnetic field ( upper left panel ) , showing low - density structures aligned mainly in the direction of the field lines while the projection along the field line ( upper right panel ) presents regular structures , with no preferred direction .",
    "interestingly , in a higher density tracer , there is no clear morphological difference between projections along or perpendicular to the initial field ( see fig  [ maps_b_21 ] . )",
    "the maximum values of the column density are similar in both physical and observational projections for small magnetic field intensity . nevertheless , in the strong - field case ( ma4x , see upper panels in fig .",
    "[ maps_b_10 ] and  [ maps_b_21 ] ) the column density integrated perpendicular to the mean field ( right panels ) is higher than the column density integrated parallel to it ( left panels ) , as can be seen in the grayscale bars .",
    "this effect can be explained in the same way as that shown in figure  [ magnetic ] : strong magnetic fields only allow compressions parallel to the field .",
    "therefore , when we observe along the magnetic field lines we do not see high column density contrasts , while when we observe perpendicular to the field lines , we see higher contrasts in the compressions along the field lines . as a summary , _ strong fields can produce anisotropy and compressed structures perpendicular to the field lines , but weaker fields merely reduce the maximum density contrast somewhat .",
    "_      velocity crowding contributes substantially to the generation of clumps in observational space , so observed clumps frequently contain emission from physically separated regions @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate this effect using a typical mhd simulation : mc41 .",
    "we choose this run because it has intermediate values of driving strength ( @xmath51 ) and wavenumber ( @xmath53 ) , and it clearly shows the effects of superposition .",
    "figure  [ map_mc41 ] shows physical and observed maps for @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) .",
    "we see that clumps in real space ( letters a , b , and c in panel @xmath57 ) do not necessarily have a counterpart in observational space .",
    "clumps in observational space , on the other hand , ( letter d in panel @xmath58 ) do not necessarily come from isolated regions in real space , but have contributions from many different regions along the same line of sight . in figure  [ map_mc41 ]",
    "we plot dotted lines that show the places where the emission of a physical clump lies in observational space , and where the emission from an observational clump is generated in physical space . for reference",
    ", we use the same lines in the @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) map as in the @xmath8co(2 - 1 ) map .",
    "for the same data set we made another set of maps using higher density tracers .",
    "figure  [ mc41_cs10 ] shows the emission of cs(1 - 0 ) .",
    "the same lines are shown as in figure  [ map_mc41 ] , to indicate the location of the large @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) core . in this case , the illusory observational clump d has almost disappeared , and the physical clump a is observed more clearly in its observational counterpart .",
    "we also note that the position that we would attribute to the cores in different tracers is slightly different . in order to quantify the effects of superposition",
    ", we now compute the typical number @xmath59 of physically disconnected regions that contribute to the emission of a single observed clump .",
    "to do so , we developed an algorithm that brackets each observed clump in position and velocity and calculates the number of connected regions in physical space within the bracketed region in phase space .    in figure",
    "[ subclumps]_a _ we show the influence of driving strength and wavenumber on the amount of superposition .",
    "we find that high - density tracers behave differently than low - density tracers . in the case of a high - density tracer such as cs , @xmath60  23 , and is almost constant for different driving strengths and wavenumbers . on the other hand , in the case of a low - density tracer such as @xmath8co , which emits from most of the cube , superposition increases with driving wavenumber .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the way we forced the models , since short - wavelength driving produces multiple physical regions at the same velocity .",
    "there is also a marginal tendency for strongly - driven models to exhibit more superposition than weakly - driven ones .",
    "this occurs because the greater velocity dispersion in the strongly - driven model produces clumps with greater internal velocity dispersion that more easily overlap .",
    "we conclude that higher - density tracers will better disentangle velocity crowding , as is shown by the results using cs(1 - 0 ) , though still by no means completely .    in figure",
    "[ subclumps]_b _ we show the relative influence of the magnetic field by examining @xmath59 as a function of the ratio of the driving strength to the initial magnetic field strength @xmath61 .",
    "we find that the amount of superposition is a bit larger when we observe along the mean field direction ( @xmath39 ) than when we observe perpendicular to it .",
    "the effect is small , but present , and it is a consequence of the greater compressions parallel to the field lines producing more condensed clumps with smaller cross - sections for superposition when observed perpendicular to the field lines .",
    "a final word concerning superposition is in order : although it is true that high spatial resolution helps to segregate large clouds into their clumps , high velocity resolution does not necessarily help to disentangle superposition .",
    "it only helps if there is a monotonic velocity gradient along the line of sight , such that two clumps with similar velocities merge at low velocity resolution , and can be separated at higher velocity resolution .",
    "if clumps are produced in regions of converging flow in a larger turbulent region , however , as is likely the case in real clouds , then the velocity gradients will not be monotonic , and physically disconnected regions will often share the same line - of - sight velocity , so increasing velocity resolution will not help .    as a summary ,",
    "we conclude that velocity crowding is likely to always occur , implying that cores in observational space are not single entities in real space , and that it is larger for low - density tracers , large driving wavenumbers , and when we look along the mean field lines .",
    "if observed clumps have contributions from multiple physical regions , it is important to understand whether the relationships reported for observed clumps in molecular clouds have anything to do with the properties of the actual physical clumps .",
    "@xcite studied the dependence on size of the mean density , velocity dispersion , and mass spectrum of the clouds in a sample of observational data taken from the literature .",
    "he found    @xmath62    @xmath63    and    @xmath64    the most commonly quoted values in the literature are @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 have been attributed to virial equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however , there is some discrepancy in the values reported @xcite , especially for high latitude clouds , where the velocity dispersion - size relationship has been questioned @xcite .",
    "@xcite himself already suggested that the relationships he identified might be due to the limitations of the observations , but it was @xcite who first demonstrated that the observed mean density - size relationship could be due to observational effects , and that the observed and physical properties such as radius or volumetric density may be quite different .",
    "@xcite showed that co and extinction saturate at roughly the same column density , which forms the upper envelope of the mean density - size relationship .",
    "he also discussed how the surveys are biased due to the limitations of instrumental sensitivity and saturation .",
    "@xcite reproduced the mass spectrum , as well as the velocity dispersion - size relationship ( although with large scatter ) for clumps in physical space , using two - dimensional models .",
    "they reported the lack of a mean density - size relationship , confirming numerically the analysis by kegel ( 1989 , see also the discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) in the sense that there are clouds with small sizes and low column density that will be undetected in observational surveys .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported a slope close to @xmath70 for the mean density - size relationship derived from simulated observations of their models , and a very flat correlation between velocity dispersion and size ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "as they mentioned , both results are a consequence of their clump finding method ( based on what they call regions of contrast ) , which samples the entire line of sight .",
    "none of these studies attempting to explain the origin of the @xcite relationships have compared simulated observations to the actual physical density and velocity distributions for the same numerical model .",
    "we now do that , using the three - dimensional simulations of molecular clouds that we have described above .",
    "we must first define the size of a clump , both in observational and in physical space . for clumps drawn from simulated observations",
    "we take the circular radius , defined as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the projected area of the clump on the plane of the sky , for comparison with wgb94 . for physical clumps",
    "we take the geometric radius , defined as @xmath74 .",
    "other definitions are equally valid , but can lead to differences of a factor up to half an order of magnitude when comparing different size definitions , and differences of as much as a factor of 100 when calculating mean densities by dividing the total mass by the size .    finally , since the results discussed in the present section do not appear to depend on the parameters of the runs we analyze or ( in the magnetic case ) on the projection with respect to the mean magnetic field , we only present results for run hc8 - 256 ( see table  [ simulations ] ) , an available high - resolution run ( @xmath4 zones ) .",
    "we search for clumps in physical space using clumpfind , considering only regions with a density larger than 650  cm3 , the critical density for @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) emission .",
    "the results do seem to depend on the clumpfinding scheme used and on its parameters .",
    "for example , the number and size of the clumps found in clumpfinddepends on the level of refinement used in clumpfind : at high refinement , large clumps can be split into multiple smaller clumps , changing not only the slope of the mass spectrum , but also the dynamical range of size in the scaling relations .      in fig .  [ rhomeanfig ] ( upper panel ) , we show the mean density - size relationship for clumps in three - dimensional physical space .",
    "we note three points about this figure .",
    "first , the relation between mean density and size given by equation  ( [ rhomean ] ) is not seen at all , confirming the results of vbr97 from two - dimensional models .",
    "second , there is a minimum density below which there are no clumps identified .",
    "this minimum is just given by the density threshold we used in clumpfind .",
    "third , even though the simulations exhibit a large dynamical range in density ( @xmath75 ) , the dynamical range in the mean density - size relationship is small , because in constructing such a plot we choose the clumps around the local density maxima .    in the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ rhomeanfig ] we show the mean density - size relationship for clumps in simulated observational maps of the same run , integrated along the @xmath38 axis .",
    "the middle panel is the one obtained by using cs(1 - 0 ) , and the lower panel is the relationship obtained by using @xmath8co(1 - 0 ) .",
    "the observed clumps do exhibit approximately the relationship given by @xcite , despite the lack of correlation exhibited by the physical clumps in this model .",
    "we conclude from this demonstration that the observed density - size relationship ( eq .  [ [ rhomean ] ] ) is an observational artifact .",
    "two mechanisms have been suggested to explain density - size relationship with slope @xmath76 in observations .",
    "first , it might be due to the selection effect described by @xcite : only clouds with intensity exceeding the noise threshold determined by the instrumentation will be detected , effectively setting a column density cutoff , rather than the physical density cutoff imposed in the physical density - size relationship .",
    "a constant column density cutoff produces a cutoff with slope @xmath70 in the mean density - size plane ( middle and lower panels ) , just as the constant physical density cutoff in physical space produces a flat cutoff .",
    "second , it might be due to the limited dynamical range of the observations @xcite .",
    "to understand this , lets consider the simulations : if we had clumps with constant column density @xmath77 , we would infer a mean density @xmath78 , giving exactly a slope of @xmath70 . in the simulation analyzed here",
    "we do not have a constant column density , but the column density varies by only a factor of 30 ( see burkert &  mac low 2001 ) , far less than the variation in physical density .",
    "even worse , from this narrow distribution , the selected clumps have an even narrower column density distribution : on the one hand , as we already mentioned , there is a column density cutoff given by the minimum intensity used in clumpfind ; on the other hand , even the emission of the brightest clump does not come from the whole line of sight , and its column density is not the largest column density available in the simulation .",
    "the end result is that selected clumps naturally end up with column density constant to within an order of magnitude , consistent with the observed scatter in the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ rhomeanfig ] .",
    "similar arguments can be applied to the observational data .",
    "for example , when observing emission lines from molecules , there is a limited dynamical range in density available in which any particular tracer can be excited : it will not be excited at too low density , and it will become optically thick at too high a density @xcite . at iras wavelengths , @xcite claim constant column densities in iras observations of dust , where the dynamical range of the data should have allowed detection of any significant variations .",
    "however , @xcite showed that for iras observations , only the external layers of the clouds are heated by the diffuse uv radiation , so that the emission at 60 and 100  @xmath79 m actually comes from surface layers that are indeed expected to have nearly constant column density .    finally , we point out that deviations from the mean density - size relationship have also been found in observations @xcite , suggesting that with sufficient care , the trap of apparently constant column density can be overcome .      in figure  [ deltavfig ]",
    "we show the velocity dispersion - size relationship for clumps in physical and observational space . in the case of physical space ( upper panel )",
    "the typical velocity dispersion is of order of 0.2  km  s@xmath12 , a value that coincides with the value of the fluctuations of the overall velocity field for the run analyzed here ( hc8 - 256 ) .",
    "the slope fit to the data is 0.3  @xmath80  0.38 , smaller than the value of 1/2 suggested for compressible turbulent behavior ( see , e.g. , vbr97 ) , but with a strong scatter .",
    "in fact , in order to reduce substantially the uncertainty in the determination of the slope , we should have at least two orders of magnitude of dynamical range in sizes if the scatter is about one order of magnitude , as it is the case .",
    "but with clumpfind , it is difficult to have a large dynamical range ( see , e.g. , upper right panel of fig 7 in @xcite ) , since a reasonable refinement of the intensity contouring makes large clumps split up into several pieces @xcite .    on the other hand , when we analyze observational data as in fig  [ deltavfig ] ( lower panel ) , additional problems play a role .",
    "we now have the possibility that substantial superposition is occurring , in particular for low - density tracers .",
    "if this is so , the velocity dispersion of a single observed clump will reflect the velocity dispersion of several , physically disconnected regions in the same line of sight .",
    "this will also help to produce both large mean values of @xmath81 ( 0.8  km  s@xmath12 , compared to the 0.2  km  s@xmath12corresponding to the mean velocity fluctuations in the simulation ) and low values of the slope in the velocity dispersion - size relationship ( fig .",
    "[ deltavfig ] , lower panel ) .",
    "in contrast , for high density tracers ( cs(1 - 0 ) , fig.[deltavfig ] , middle panel ) , we obtain a steeper relationship ( 0.46 ) , and the mean velocity dispersion drops back to @xmath82  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "three reasons why this occurs are : in the case of high density tracers there is weaker superposition as shown in fig .",
    "[ subclumps ] ; clumps are substantially smaller than in the low - density case , giving smaller velocity dispersion ; and the sizes span about one and a half orders of magnitude , favoring disentanglement between the scatter and the actual trend .",
    "now we turn to the clump mass spectrum . before showing the mass spectra for the simulations",
    ", we have to think about the nature of the turbulent density structure and how clumpfind  ( or any other clumpfinding algorithm ) works .",
    "for instance , in a driven turbulent medium , such as the simulations we examine here , we expect density fluctuations at all scales above the dissipation scale .",
    "it is not at all clear when to stop counting substructure inside structure . in other words",
    ", should we look for all the stones in the small hills in every single mountain of the mountain chain , or only count the larger mountains ?",
    "if only the larger mountains , how do we define a lower limit ?",
    "intuitively , we might think that the dependence of clump numbers on clumpfind  parameters would be reduced in regions where clumps are well defined and reasonably isolated , as in an isolated star - formation region where cores have suffered some amount of collapse . to show that this is _",
    "not _ the case , we show in figure  [ mapa_hc8 ] a contour map of a slice through the center of model hc8 .",
    "we use five and ten isocontours between an arbitrary density threshold of @xmath83 and the maximum density @xmath84 . as we can see , the density structures seem to be well - separated and reasonably well defined . in figure  [ closeup_hc8 ]",
    "we present an enlargement of the lower - right corner of figure  [ mapa_hc8 ] , again using five and ten isocontours .",
    "we see that , even for the same density threshold , by changing the number of isocontours we find five more peaks ( see right panel in fig .  [ closeup_hc8 ] ) that will result in five new clumps in clumpfind .",
    "this happens in just a small region containing what we would think of as well - defined structures , at a single slice in @xmath39 .",
    "but in practice , we have 3d structures , so that every structure is far more complicated than apparent at first glance . even without considering",
    "whether observational and physical clumps are the same or not , the mass spectrum appears to be more an artifact of the manner in which we count clumps than an actual physical characterization of the structure , unless we count them exhaustively all the way down to the numerical or physical dissipation scales below which there is no longer well - defined structure .",
    "we note also that in the case of self - gravitating simulations the result is the same ( ossenkopf et al .",
    "2001 ) , and that similar results will hold for observations : at low resolution the structures look soft , but once we increase the resolution and the sensitivity , structure emerges inside the structure , as is clear from figure  4 in dame et al .",
    ".    preliminary work by @xcite shows that , by setting the density threshold in physical space to the average density , a large enough number of contour levels gives a log - normal mass spectrum , independently of the number of contours used .",
    "we compute the mass distribution using this prescription for run hc8 smoothed at a resolution of @xmath85 for physical space , and @xmath86 velocity channels for observational space in order to avoid excessive computation time and memory usage by clumpfind .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ masspec ] .",
    "the upper panel corresponds to physical space , and the lower panel corresponds to observational space , where instead of density , we used intensity contouring .",
    "the results are clear : for large number of isocontours the shape of the mass spectrum converges .",
    "good agreement is observed in the large - mass end of the distribution , although slower convergence is observed at the low - mass end .",
    "convergence to a factor of two for the full spectrum appears to be reached for 64 or more contours .    in fig .",
    "[ lognormal ] we compare the mass spectrum calculated in physical space ( bold line ) to that from observational space ( thin line ) using 512 isocontours .",
    "the dotted parabola shows a log - normal fit that reproduces fairly well the large - mass end of the spectra",
    ". such log - normal behavior of the observed spectrum might explain observations obtained for dense cores in the last few years .",
    "in particular , @xcite found a power - law mass spectrum with slope of @xmath87 for star - forming cores in serpens , substantially larger than the standard @xmath88 value .",
    "moreover , @xcite found a change in slope at low mass : the less massive cores exhibit slope of @xmath88 , considerably shallower than the @xmath89 slope found for the more massive cores .",
    "finally , we note that in these works , the mass spectrum was obtained using dust continuum observations with high signal - to - noise ratios . for present - day molecular - line observations , typical signal - to - noise ratios of 10 or less do not allow small contour separation , since contouring at less than the signal - to - noise ratio is meaningless @xcite .",
    "mass spectra derived from such observations are likely to be far from physical ( fig .",
    "[ masspec ] ) .",
    "we analyze a set of three - dimensional mhd numerical simulations at intermediate ( @xmath3 zones ) and higher ( @xmath4 zones ) resolution described by @xcite , in which the parameters driving strength ( @xmath0 ) , driving wavenumber ( @xmath1 ) , and initial magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) are varied .",
    "we show that :    * density fluctuations are primarily controlled by the driving luminosity : the larger the luminosity , the larger the fluctuations seen in the maps .",
    "morphology of the density structure , on the other hand , is primarily controlled by the driving wavelength : the larger the driving wavelength , the larger the structures seen in the maps , and vice - versa . *",
    "the magnetic field only produces detectable effects in our simulated molecular line observations if the fields are strong and in the plane of the sky , and the structure is observed in low density tracers . when observing magnetized clouds , it is slightly easier to obtain larger column densities if the field is in the plane of the sky than if it is perpendicular to it . *",
    "simulated observational maps of the models show strong superposition of structures along the line of sight .",
    "this implies that single clumps in observational space are frequently the superposition of multiple clumps in physical space .",
    "the apparent properties of observed clumps are poorly related to the physical properties of their constituent objects if strong superposition occurs .",
    "* we explore the effect of the simulation parameters on the generation of strong velocity crowding , finding that large driving strength and large wavenumber tend to favor velocity crowding .",
    "so far , the only more - or - less reliable method to ensure there is no substantial superposition of clumps is to use high - density ( close to the maximum density ) tracers .",
    "nevertheless , even in those situations superposition can occur .",
    "* larson s ( 1981 ) mean - density to size relationship does not exist in physical space , but does occur in our simulated observations .",
    "it appears to be an observational artifact , whose explanation we discuss .",
    "* larson s velocity - dispersion to size relationship is reproduced in both physical clumps and simulated observations , though with substantial scatter in the slope .",
    "more dynamical range in the simulations would probably help , although our clumps already span an order of magnitude in size with half an order of magnitude in scatter .",
    "* the mass spectra converge to a particular shape only when we use large number of contours ( above 32 for the high mass end , but above 64 for the whole spectrum ) , corresponding to an extraordinarily large signal - to - noise ratio in the observations . rather than a single power law",
    ", they seem to follow a log - normal distribution .",
