    "stellar populations are fundamental tracers of the formation and evolution history of their parent galaxy .",
    "the accurate determination of their basic parameters ( as age , metallicity and distance ) are then crucial , but this is restricted to a number of relatively nearby stellar systems , for which single stars are spatially resolved and whose magnitudes can be accurately determined . at least the brightest portion of the red giant branch ( rgb ) is needed in order to have hits on metallicity and distance , while the detection of the main sequence turn - off ( ms - to ) is required to get the age . in this respect ,",
    "detailed investigations of simple stellar populations ( ssp , _",
    "i.e. _ coeval and chemically homogeneous stellar aggregates ) offer a unique opportunity to empirically calibrate suitable photometric indices and evolutionary features in terms of the overall metallicity of the system .",
    "stellar clusters represent the best approximation of ssp known in the universe , hence they are ideal tools for this purpose . an empirical method to get simultaneously metallicity and reddening from the",
    "morphology and location of the rgb in the @xmath0 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) has been presented a decade ago @xcite .",
    "more recently , this method has been extended to the @xmath1 plane by @xcite and further improved by @xcite and @xcite by adopting the @xcite and the global ( @xmath2 $ ] ) metallicity scale , respectively .",
    "the method presented here adopts the most recent calibrations as obtained from a large ir photometric database of gcs , collected by our group with different instruments at the eso telescopes ( la silla , chile ) and at the tng ( la palma , spain ) over the last decade in the framework of a long - term project devoted to study the photometric properties of the rgb @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have recently presented a complete set of photometric indices ( colors , magnitudes and slopes ) describing the location and the morphology of the rgb and their calibrations in terms of the global cluster metallicity @xcite , together with the empirical calibrations of the ir luminosity of the two major rgb evolutionary features , namely the rgb bump and tip @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , the calibration relations used in this study rely on a database , whose properties have been derived in a fully self  consistent way .",
    "in fact , the adopted estimates of the cluster reddening , metallicity and distance are based _",
    "i ) _ on a homogeneous photometric system ; _ ii ) _ on the @xcite distance scale which relies on the most recent and largest database of galactic gcs ; and _ iii ) _ on a uniform and high  resolution metallicity scale @xcite .",
    "the calibration of suitable relations to derive metallicity , reddening and distance in the near ir plane is crucial in the study of extragalactic bulges , which can be characterized by high metallicities and can be affected by severe reddening .",
    "the current generation of ground - based ir instrumentation with high resolution and wide field coverage , and the future availability of the james webb space telescope will allow us to resolve the brightest giants in galaxies up to several mpc away , and to derive their overall metallicity , reddening and distance modulus with great accuracy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 discusses the adopted metallicity scale , while  3 and  4 present the equation sets for both the _ disk - like _ and _ bulge - like enrichment scenarios _ , respectively .",
    " 5 describes the computational routine which provides photometric estimates of metallicity , reddening and distance , while in  6 we test the described method on two template gcs in the galactic bulge and in the large magellanic cloud , namely ngc  6539 and ngc  1978 respectively , in order to demonstrate its reliability .",
    "as widely discussed in @xcite a correct parameterization of the rgb characteristics as function of the metal content of the population does require the knowledge of the so - called _ global _ metallicity , which takes into account the iron as well as the @xmath3element abundances .",
    "this is an important point since the location of the rgb strongly depends on the low  ionization potential [ fe+mg+si / h ] abundance mixture @xcite rather than on [ fe / h ] abundance alone .",
    "in fact , low ",
    "ionization potential elements are the main contributors to free electrons which generate the @xmath4 ion , the major component responsible for the continuum opacity in the rgb temperature range ( 30006000  k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in halo / disk field",
    "stars the average [ @xmath3/fe ] abundance ratio shows a general enhancement of 0.30.5 dex with respect to the solar value up to [ fe / h]@xmath51 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and a linear decreasing trend towards solar [ @xmath3/fe ] with further increasing metallicity .",
    "a [ @xmath3/fe ] enhancement is also found in the metal poor halo gcs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , until a few years ago , only a few measurements were available in the high metallicity regime , to properly define the [ @xmath3/fe ] trend in gcs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the actual position of the knee ( i.e. the metallicity at which [ @xmath3/fe ] begins to decrease ) depends on the type  ia sn timescales and it is also a function of the star formation rate , while the amount of @xmath6 enhancement depends on the initial mass function of the progenitors of the type  ii sne ( see * ? ? ?",
    "measurements of metal rich field and cluster giants towards the galactic bulge are a recent accomplishment of high resolution optical and ir spectroscopy .",
    "bulge stars are indeed ideal targets to study the behavior of the abundance patterns in the high metallicity domain , but foreground extinction is so great as to largely preclude optical studies of any kind , particularly at high spectral resolution .",
    "the most accurate abundance determinations obtained so far and based on high resolution optical spectroscopy refer to a sample of k  giants in the baade s window @xcite and a few giants in two gcs , namely ngc  6553 and ngc  6528 @xcite .",
    "recently , high resolution ir spectroscopic measurements of m giants in the baade s window @xcite as well as of bulge gcs @xcite dramatically extended the sample of measured bulge stars .",
    "all these studies point toward a @xmath3-enhancement by a factor of 2 - 3 up to solar metallicity .",

    "metallicity for a sample of 61 ggcs , @xcite used a constant @xmath7=0.28 $ ] for @xmath8<-1 $ ] and linearly decreasing to zero at @xmath9<0 $ ] . in the following",
    "we compute two independent sets of global metallicities and photometric relations , according to two different scenarios ( see fig .",
    "[ scenario ] ) :    _ scenario ( 1 ) - _ _ disk - like _ enhancement ( accordingly to @xcite ) @xmath7=0.3 $ ] for @xmath8<-1 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] linearly decreasing to zero for @xmath9\\le0 $ ] .    _ scenario ( 2 ) - _ _ bulge - like _",
    "enhancement ( accordingly to carney s ( 1996 ) suggestions and the recent results on the bulge field and cluster populations ) @xmath7=0.30 $ ] constant over the entire range of metallicity ( @xmath10\\le0 $ ] ) .",
    "the set of equations discussed in @xcite[hereafter paper  i ] and @xcite[hereafter paper  ii ] have been computed accordingly to _ scenario ( 1)_. here we present similar equations for _ scenario ( 2 ) _ , so the reader can choose the equation set which turns out to be the most suitable to the describe the stellar system .    in both scenarios the contribution of the @xmath3element enhancement has been taken into account by simply re  scaling standard models to the _ global _ metallicity [ m / h ] according to the following relation @xcite : @xmath11 = [ fe / h ] + log_{10 } ( 0.638 f_{\\alpha}+0.362)\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the enhanced factor of the @xmath3elements .      in this section",
    "we present and discuss the equation set adopted to construct the computational routine which provides metallicity , reddening and distance of a stellar population , by using the rgb observables in the @xmath13 ir plane .",
    "note that the validity of the relations has been extended up to [ m / h]@xmath14 + 0.4  dex , with respect to the results presented in paper  i , including the recent results on the metallicity of ngc  6791 @xcite .",
    "hence the relations presented here have been obtained in the metallicity range : -2.16@xmath15[fe / h]@xmath15 + 0.4 dex .",
    "the overall metallicity of a stellar population can be linked to the slope of the rgb ( @xmath16 ) as defined in the near ir - cmd , by @xcite and @xcite , accordingly to the following relation : @xmath17 = -2.53 -20.83 ( slope^{jk}_{rgb})\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the rgb slope measured following the prescriptions discussed in paper  i in the @xmath13-cmd .",
    "the rgb - tip luminosity is a quantity well predicted by theoretical models and it can be easily measured in populous stellar systems like galaxies .",
    "the luminosity of the rgb tip for stellar populations older than @xmath19 gyr is nearly independent from the population age .",
    "moreover , it turns out to be particularly bright in the near - ir ( @xmath20 ) hence , it is a very promising standard candle up to large distances .",
    "the main limitation of this method is the clear - cut determination of the rgb - tip luminosity that could be seriously affected by low - number statistics .",
    "in fact , the rapid star evolution near the end of the rgb , makes the brightest portion of the rgb intrinsically poorly populated .",
    "however , this problem is marginal in very populous stellar systems .",
    "the dependence of this feature from the overall metallicity of the stellar population has been empirically determined by using a sample of galactic gcs ( see paper  ii ) and it turns out to be in good agreement with theoretical expectations . here",
    "we report the relation obtained in paper  ii : @xmath21\\ ] ]    as well known ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for clusters older than 2 gyr the level of the helium - burning red clump ( rc ) is mainly influenced by metallicity and it shows little dependence on the age .",
    "hence for relatively old metal rich populations ( @xmath22>-1 $ ] ) it is also possible to use the level of the rc as an additional distance indicator .",
    "we estimate the mean level of the rc by using a metal - rich ( -0.9@xmath23[fe / h]@xmath23 - 0.3 ) cluster subsample ( namely , 47  tuc , ngc  6342 , ngc  6380 , ngc  6441 , ngc  6440 , ngc  6553 , ngc  6528 , and ngc  6637 ) selected from the global database presented in paperi .",
    "the value turns out to be : @xmath24 note that most selected clusters can be considered coeval within 10 - 20% accordingly to @xcite who measured the relative ages of 47  tuc , ngc  6342 , ngc  6637 and @xcite who measured the relative ages of 47  tuc , ngc  6528 , ngc  6553 .",
    "the adopted uncertainty of @xmath25 in equation ( 3 ) , takes into account the metallicity dependence of the rc position in the metallicity range spanned by our metal  rich gc subsample ( @xmath26\\sim 0.6 dex$ ] ) .",
    "in fact , accordingly to table 1 by @xcite the @xmath27 level is expected to vary @xmath28 at @xmath29 over a such metallicty range .",
    "moreover in the age range 2 - 10gyr , at fixed metallicity ( @xmath2=-0.68 $ ] ) the @xmath27 varies 0.03 mag per gyr . hence the 0.2 mag uncertainty adopted as conservative estimate of the @xmath27 level",
    "is expected to be reasonable over the considered range of age and metallicity .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the rgb at fixed color is another observable that can be used to define useful relations with the overall metallicity .",

    "to test the reliability of the proposed technique we have chosen two metal - rich clusters for which accurate determination of the metallicity have been recently obtained : the large magellanic cloud cluster ngc  1978 , and the galactic bulge cluster ngc  6539 .",
