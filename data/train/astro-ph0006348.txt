    "recently , _ quintessence _ in the form of slow - rolling scalar field @xmath109 has been proposed as an alternative form of dark energy density with negative pressure @xcite , and refs .  therein .",
    "the true minimum of the quintessence potential is presumed to vanish , i.e.  @xmath110 , however the present value of @xmath109 is displaced from the true minimum , providing u_q~(310 ^ -3 ev)^4 , [ quintpotential ] and a negative pressure with the equation of state = -0.6 , while obeying the usual equations of motion .",
