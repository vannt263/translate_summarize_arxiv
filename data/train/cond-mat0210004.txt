    "in the last few years , there has been considerable theoretical and experimental interest in colloidal systems with anisotropic host fluids @xcite .    since the temperature changes the anisotropic properties of the host fluid , the dispersed particles exhibit a rich variety of collective behaviors , leading to unexpected phase diagrams @xcite . depending on the details of the system , chain - like @xcite , crystal @xcite or cellular @xcite structures have been observed .    in the case of nematic hosts in three dimensions ( 3d ) ,",
    "the colloidal interactions result from the competition between the anchoring properties of the spherical colloidal surfaces favoring e.g. , radial ( homeotropic ) nematic orientation ( anchoring ) and the bulk elasticity that favors a uniform nematic . for sufficiently strong homeotropic anchoring @xmath0",
    ", the spherical colloids may induce topological defects or singularities in the nematic director field .",
    "if the size of the colloidal particle @xmath1 is large when compared to the nematic correlation length @xmath2 , a hyperbolic point defect appears at a certain distance from the particle ( _ satellite dipolar _",

    ", however , a ring disclination around the equatorial plane of the sphere may have a lower energy ( _ saturn - ring quadrupolar _",
    "configuration @xcite ) . finally , if @xmath3 is smaller than the typical nematic elastic constant @xmath4 , the director field varies smoothly and there are no defects ( _ surface - ring quadrupolar _",
    "configuration @xcite ) .",
    "depending on the symmetry of the distortion @xcite , the dominant long range interactions are dipolar @xcite or quadrupolar @xcite .",
    "the short range interactions are more difficult to predict , as nonlinear terms in the elastic free energy come into play .",
    "experimental evidence from a system where silicon oil droplets were dispersed in a nematic host @xcite reveals that when the nematic configuration around each droplet has dipolar symmetry , the attractive long range interaction between aligned droplets becomes strongly repulsive at short distances .",
    "a nematic topological defect appears between the particles and prevents their collapse .",
    "by contrast , when the long range distortion exhibits quadrupolar symmetry no such defects appear and the oil droplets coalesce .",
    "2d colloidal systems were also investigated recently and similar qualitative features were observed . in these systems the interactions between the dispersed particles are also mediated by the elastic distorsions of the anisotropic host .",
    "however , for 2d nematic hosts and homeotropic anchoring conditions , only quadrupolar configurations are stable @xcite .",
    "dipolar configurations may be found in 2d smectic c films @xcite , a system that is similar to a 2d nematic , but where the director does not exhibit mirror symmetry , thus excluding configurations with half integer topological charges . in this case , pettey et al .",
    "@xcite obtained analytic expressions for the free energy of a system of multiple disk - defect pairs , valid in the linear regime where the particles are sufficiently far apart .",
    "we investigated the short range interactions in this system by using a numerical method capable of describing the nematic orientation profiles induced by a small number of colloids with arbitrary shape in 2d @xcite .",
    "numerical investigations of this type are faced with a problem due to the very different length scales characterizing the colloids and the topological defects .",
    "we have solved it @xcite , by using finite elements with adaptive meshing to minimize the frank free energy and obtained very accurate interaction energies between disks at arbitrary separations .",
    "we have found a strong repulsion at short range followed by the expected long range dipolar interaction with a pronounced minimum at an intermediate distance .",

    "finally , we present the results of extensive numerical calculations for the interaction between disks at arbitrary separations .",
    "in the tensor order parameter formalism the 2d nematic order is represented by the ( tilt ) angle of the director field @xmath6 , that describes the mean orientation of the molecules , and the orientational order parameter @xmath7 , that measures the degree of alignment of the molecules with respect to the mean orientation . in the isotropic phase , where the molecules point in every direction , @xmath8 . by contrast , in the nematic phase the molecules are preferentially aligned and the orientational order parameter takes a well defined equilibrium value @xmath9 that depends on the temperature .    we define a 2d symmetric traceless tensor field , from the tilt angle @xmath10 and the orientational order parameter @xmath11 , @xmath12 that is invariant under the nematic symmetry operations @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    the landau - de gennes free energy may be understood as a taylor expansion in terms of the tensor order parameter @xmath15 ( the bulk free energy ) and its derivatives @xmath16 ( the elastic free energy ) @xcite : @xmath17 where the summation over repeated indices is implied .",
