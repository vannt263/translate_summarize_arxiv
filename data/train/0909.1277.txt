    "the study of the binary star population in stellar systems represents an important field of research of stellar astrophysics .",
    "binary stars are a unique tool to determine crucial information about a variety of stellar properties .",
    "moreover , they play a key role in the dynamical evolution of stellar systems and stellar populations studies . in collisional systems ( like stellar clusters ) binaries provide the gravitational fuel that can delay and eventually stop and reverse the process of gravitational collapse ( see hut et al . 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of binaries in star clusters can produce peculiar objects of astrophysic interest like blue stragglers , cataclysmic variables , low - mass x - ray binaries , millisecond pulsars , etc .",
    "( see bailyn 1995 and reference therein ) . finally , the binary fraction is a key ingredient in dynamical models to study the evolution of galaxies and stellar systems in general ( zhang et al . 2005 ) .    at odds with the galactic field ,",
    "several processes determine the relative frequency of binary systems in stellar clusters .",
    "in fact , binaries are continuously formed and destroyed during the evolution of the cluster as a result of the ever continuing interactions between binaries and single stars .",
    "the scenario is further complicated by the dynamical evolution of the cluster ( mass segregation , evaporation , etc . ) that acts on binary and single stars in a different way and produces radial gradients in the frequency of binaries . for these reasons ,",
    "the theoretical modelling of the dynamics of stellar systems including the effect of binaries is still an open challenge ( portegies zwart , mcmillan & makino 2007 ; ivanova et al . 2005 ; hurley , aarseth & shara 2007 ; sollima 2008 ) .    from the observational point of view , until recent years , the binary fraction has been estimated only in few individual globular clusters ( gcs ) ( romani & weinberg 1991 ; bolte 1992 ; rubenstein & bailyn 1997 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "2002 ; clark , sandquist & bolte 2004 ; zhao & bailyn 2005 ) .",
    "these studies argued for a deficiency of binary stars in gcs compared to the field ( pryor et al .",
    "1989 ; hut 1992 ; cote et al .",
    "more recently , we investigated the fraction of binaries in a sample of thirteen low - density gcs ( sollima et al .",
    "this study revealed that these gcs hold a fraction of binaries ranging from 10% to 50% depending on the cluster .",
    "in such analysis , an anti - correlation with the cluster age has been also noticed .",
    "milone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) enlarged the sample of analysed clusters and showed an even stronger anti - correlation between binary fraction and cluster luminosity ( mass ) .",
    "this last correlation is predicted by theoretical models as a consequence of the similar dependence of the cluster mass and of the efficency of the binary destruction process on the cluster density and velocity dispersion ( sollima 2008 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the sparse number of analysed objects together with the small range of parameters covered by the sample does not allow a firm conclusion on this issue .",
    "open clusters ( ocs ) represents an important group of objects to study the frequency of binary systems .",
    "they are indeed both less massive and younger than gcs , covering a range of structural parameters where homogeneous determinations of binary fractions are still missing .",
    "moreover , their proximity and low density makes the determination of the binary frequency in these stellar systems particularly easy .",
    "estimates of the binary fraction in individual open ocs have been provided by several authors ( sandhu , pandey & sagar 2003 ; bica & bonatto 2005 and references therein ) . however , it is difficult to interpret the results obtained by these authors in a global picture because of the different assumption made in these works .",
    "a recent homogeneous analysis of the fraction of binaries in a sample of six ocs have been presented by sharma et al .",
    "nevertheless , a direct comparison of these last results with those obtained for gcs is not possible since these authors _ i ) _ assume a significantly different distribution of mass - ratios and _ ii ) _ measure the fraction of binaries over the entire cluster extent .    in this paper",
    "we present an estimate of the binary fraction in the core of five high - latitude ocs .",
    "we used a set of archive images obtained with the wide field imager ( at the eso2.2 m telescope ) , wide field camera ( isaac newton telescope ) and 1.5 m danish telescope cameras .",
    "in  2 we describe the observations and the data reduction techniques . in ",
    "3 the adopted method to determine the fraction of binary systems is presented . in ",
    "4 we derived the binary fractions in our target clusters .  5 is devoted to the analysis of the correlations between the binary fractions measured in our sample of ocs and gcs and the main cluster s physical parameters .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in  6 .",
    "the photometric data - set consists of a set of wide - field images of a sample of five ocs .",
    "the target clusters have been selected on the basis of the following criteria :    * a high galactic latitude ( @xmath0 ) in order to limit the field contamination ; * an absolute visual magnitude @xmath1 in order to detect a significant sample of cluster stars .",
    "five cluster passed these criteria namely ngc188 , ngc2204 , ngc2243 , ngc2420 and ngc2516 . in table 1 the main physical parameters of the above target clusters are listed . the age ( @xmath2 ) , the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) and the galactic latitude ( @xmath3 ) are from the webda database ( mermilliod & paunzen 2003 ) while the v absolute magnitude ( @xmath4 ) from lata et al .",
    "( 2002 ) obtained by battinelli & capuzzo - dolcetta ( 1991 ) . ] .",
    "for each cluster we retrived all the available exposures in the b and v bands from the eso and ing science archives with the wfi and wfc cameras , respectively .",
    "wfi@eso2.2 m frames of ngc2204 and ngc2516 and wfc@int images of ngc188 and ngc2420 have been retrived .",
    "images cover an area of @xmath5 around the center of these clusters .",
    "each cluster has been centered in one of the chips of the camera , allowing to sample the entire cluster extent .",
    "in addition , small field ( @xmath6 ) images obtained at the 1.5 m danish telescope have been used to study the core of ngc2243 .    after applying the standard bias and flat - field correction ,",
    "the photometric analysis has been performed on the pre - reduced images using the sextractor photometric package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "given the small star density in these clusters ( @xmath7 at @xmath8 ) , crowding does not affect the aperture photometry , allowing to properly estimate the magnitude of stars . for each star we measured the flux contained within a radius r@xmath9fwhm from the star center .",
    "after applying the correction for exposure time , airmass and nominal infinite aperture , instrumental magnitudes have been transformed into the absolute johnson system by using a set of standard stars from the landolt ( 1992 ) list observed during each observing run .",
    "previous photometric analysis are present in the literature for all the clusters analysed in this work .",
    "our photometry has been compared with the photometric catalog already published ( krusberg & chaboyer 2006 for ngc188 ; kassis et al .",
    "1997 for ngc2204 ; bonifazi et al .",
    "1990 for ngc2243 ; sharma et al .",
    "2006 for ngc2420 and jeffries , thurston & hambly 2001 for ngc2516 ) .",
    "the mean magnitude differences found are always smaller than 0.02 mag in both passbands , consistent with no systematic offset .",
    "optimal astrometric solutions have been obtained through cross - correlation with a catalog suitable 2mass astrometric standard stars .",
    "the internal accuracy of the astrometry has been found to be @xmath10 .",
    "[ cmd ] shows the ( @xmath11 ) cmds of the 5 ocs in our sample .",
    "only stars within 5@xmath12 from the cluster center are shown . the cmds sample the cluster population from the sub - giant branch down to 4 - 5 magnitudes below the ms turn - off .",
    "in all the target clusters the binary sequence is well defined and distinguishable from the cluster s ms .",
    "[ riass ]    .main physical parameters of the target clusters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]",
    "in this paper we analysed the core binary population of five galactic ocs with the aim of studying their frequency in stellar systems .",
    "in all the analysed clusters the minimum binary fraction contained within one core radius is greater than 11% .",
    "this quantity seems to represent a lower limit to the binary fraction in ocs .",
    "the existing estimates of the binary fraction in other nearby ocs from radial velocity surveys agree with this lower limit ( mermilliod , grenon & mayor 2008 ; mermilliod , queloz & mayor 2008 ; mermilliod et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the _ complete _ fraction of binaries obtained in this paper range from 35% to 70% .",
    "according to the theoretical n - body simulations of portegies - zwart et al .",
    "( 2004 ) the binary fraction in a stellar system with a mass of @xmath13 and a distance to the galactic center of @xmath14 ( i.e. a typical oc ) would remain actually constant during the entire cluster evolution , rising in the cluster core from an initial 50% up to 70 - 80% in 1 gyr of evolution as a result of mass segregation .",
    "the fraction measured here are marginally smaller than the final result of these simulations . following these considerations ,",
    "the initial binary fraction in our target clusters could be @xmath15% , comparable to that observed in the solar neighborhood ( abt & levy 1976 ; duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; reid & gizis 1997 ) .    the estimated binary fractions of the clusters of our sample and those of the sample of gcs presented in sollima et al .",
    "( 2007 ) reveal a significant correlation with the absolute visual magnitude and can not exclude a dependence on the cluster age .",
    "the possible correlation with age found in sollima et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is indeed not clearly visible among the sample of ocs .",
    "the ocs analysed here hold binary fractions which are on average larger than those measured in gcs . however , the small number of ocs and the large errors in the binary fraction estimates make difficult to assess the existence ( or absence ) of a smooth correlation between these two parameters",
    ". a homogeneous analysis of a larger sample of clusters spanning a wide range of ages is therefore required to clarify this issue . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation between binary fraction and luminosity , already reported by milone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in a sample of 50 gcs , has been confirmed also in the range of mass covered by our sample of ocs ( 100 - 1000@xmath16 ) .",
    "theoretical models of evolution of stellar systems with a population of primordial binaries ( sollima 2008 ) indicates that the efficency of the binary ionization process , which represents together with mass segregation the dominant process in determining the binary fraction , has the same dependence as the mass on the cluster density and velocity dispersion .",
    "an anticorrelation between these two quantities is therefore expected . in practice , in low - mass clusters ,",
    "a larger fraction of binary systems can survive to the process of binary destruction as a consequence of the lower rate of collisions and the smaller mean kinetic energy of colliding stars .",
    "the results presented here confirm the prediction of theoretical models indicating that the process of binary ionization is the dominant process which determines the fraction of binaries in any relaxed stellar system .",
