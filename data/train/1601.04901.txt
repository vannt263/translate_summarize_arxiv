    "the maximum energy gain is quite limited by insulation problems , and the maximum voltage is around 10  mv .",
    "nevertheless , this is used for the first stage of acceleration , the particle sources , electron guns , x - ray tubes , and low - energy - ion acceleration .",
    "insulation issues limit the acceleration by static electric fields . in the general case ,",
    "the electric field is derived from a scalar potential @xmath16 and the time derivative of a vector potential @xmath19 : @xmath20 from maxwell s equations above , it follows that the time variation of the magnetic field generates an electric field , which can accelerate particles overcoming the static insulation problems .",
    "one method based on this principle is the betatron , as shown in fig .",

    "the top shows the side view , the middle the top view , and the graph at the bottom the magnetic field distribution.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the circularly symmetric magnet is fed by an alternating current at a frequency typically between 50 and 200  hz .",
    "the time - varying magnetic field @xmath21 creates an electric field @xmath3 and at the same time guides the particles on a circular trajectory . according to the field symmetry , the electric field generated is tangent to the circular orbit .",
    "betatrons were used to accelerate electrons up to about 300  mev with the energy reach limited by the saturation in the magnet yoke .",
    "one also can overcome the limitations of the electrostatic fields by radio - frequency ( rf ) acceleration .",
    "an rf oscillator feeds alternately a series of drift tubes with gaps in between them , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wideroe ] . inside the tubes ,",
    "the particle is shielded from the outside field . if the polarity of the field is reversed while the particle travels inside the tube , it gets accelerated at each gap .",
    "this leads to the synchronism condition that the distance @xmath22 between the gaps has to fulfil : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the particle velocity and @xmath25 the period of the rf oscillator .",
    "it is clear that this arrangement can not accelerate a continuous beam .",
    "only a certain phase range will be accelerated and the beam has to be bunched .    as the particle velocity increases , the drift spaces have to get longer and one loses efficiency .",
    "one can increase the radio frequency to counteract this effect but a large amount of power will be radiated as one goes to higher frequencies .",
    "it is then convenient to enclose the accelerating gap in a cavity which holds the electromagnetic energy in the form of a magnetic field and to make the resonant frequency of the cavity equal to that of the accelerating field .",
    "several of these cavities can be close together with a certain phase relationship between them ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cavities ] ) .",

    "the resulting wall current between the cavities is zero , and the common cavity walls are unnecessary .",
    "a variant of that scheme consists of placing the drift tubes in a single resonant tank such that the field has the same phase in all gaps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : alvarez ] ) .",
    "such a resonant accelerating structure was invented by alvarez , and this type is still used for the acceleration of protons with the energy ranging from 50 to 200  mev .     alvarez - type accelerating structure , scaledwidth=95.0% ]      when the particle traverses a cavity , the field varies during the passage of the particle through the accelerating gap .",
    "so , the particle will not always see the maximum field and the effective acceleration will be smaller by a certain factor .",
    "this _ transit - time factor _ @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 it quantifies the reduction of energy gain due to the fact that the particle travels with a finite velocity in an electric field with a sinusoidal time variation .",
    "the transit - time factor varies between 0 and 1 .    in the general case for a particle travelling in the @xmath4 direction , assuming that the particle velocity is constant , it is given by @xmath32    for a simple model , a uniform standing wave field @xmath33 with a constant field only present in the gap ( see fig .",

    "the reduction in acceleration becomes important for particles with low velocities , like low - energy protons and particularly ions .",
    "electrons reach a relativistic @xmath38 close to unity for a kinetic energy of 10  mev , while protons reach this only at an energy of the order of 10  gev . above these energies , the particles have basically the speed of light , and the drift - tube length remains constant .",
    "nevertheless , the drift - tube length would become very long unless the frequency is in the ghz range .",
    "so , the idea came up that the ultra - relativistic particles could be accelerated by a travelling wave in a waveguide .",
    "in order to to get continuous acceleration , the phase velocity @xmath39 of the wave has to match the velocity @xmath37 of the particle .",
    "however , rectangular or cylindrical waveguides have electric field modes with an electric field in the direction of propagation with phase velocities bigger than @xmath40 , so that the wave does not remain synchronous with the particle .",
    "the phase velocity can be adjusted by inserting irises into the waveguide , and the dimensions of the irises and cells can be tailored to match the phase velocity to the velocity of the particle .",
    "figure  [ fig : tw - cavity ] shows a sketch of such a disc - loaded travelling wave structure",
    ".        the electric field of an electromagnetic wave travelling in the @xmath4 direction ( see fig .  [",

    "so , this type of structure will continuously accelerate the particle during the passage through the structure .",
    "several phase conventions exist in the literature ( see fig .  [ fig : phase - conventions ] ) :    * mainly for circular accelerators , the origin of time is taken at the zero crossing with positive slope ; * mainly for linear accelerators , the origin of time is taken at the positive crest of the rf voltage .    in the following",
    ", i will stick to the former case of the positive zero crossing for both the linear and circular cases .",
    "common phase conventions : ( 1 ) the origin of time is taken at the zero crossing with positive slope , ( 2 ) the origin of time is taken at the positive crest of the rf voltage.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    let us consider an alvarez structure , where by design the energy gain for a particle passing through the structure at a certain rf phase @xmath46 is such that the particle reaches the next gap with the same phase @xmath46 .",
    "then the energy gain in the following gap will be again the same , and the particle will pass all gaps at this phase @xmath46 , which is called the ` synchronous phase ' .",
    "so , the energy gain is @xmath47 .",

    "the effect is opposite for particle m@xmath48 , which will gain more energy and reduce its delay compared to p@xmath48 .",
