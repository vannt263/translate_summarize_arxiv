    "reversal of the orientation of the magnetization without applying an external field seems to be of considerable interest for magnetic switching of micro - devices and caused extensive experimental and theoretical studies of the effect of currents on magnetic nanostructures .",
    "the experimental facts ex-11,ex-9,ex-15,ex-13,kab+00,ex-6,aem+02,ex-3,ex-5,ex-10,ex-20,gcj+03,okm+03 are still quite confusing , or , to put in the words of a recent short review article @xcite , `` many observed phenomena can be described qualitatively ... by a simple semi - classical spin - torque model .",
    "however , evidence of complications from several experiments suggests that a full understanding of all observations is not yet achieved '' .",
    "the by now generally accepted experimental facts are the following ones : ( 1 ) if the current of a given sign favors the parallel ( p ) magnetic configuration , the current of the opposite sign favors the antiparallel ( ap ) configuration , ( 2 ) the current needed to switch the magnetic configuration in nanostructured magnetic multilayer systems is of the order of 2 - 5 ma in samples with a volume in the range of 40 - 800 nm@xmath0 .",
    "these two facts led _ inter alia _ to a schematic effective two - level energy diagram for switching in which the critical current corresponds to the energy needed to overcome the potential barrier between the parallel and the antiparallel magnetic configuration . since experimentally also telegraph noise is observed , which in turn seems to correspond to an oscillation between these two states , this schematic picture proved to be quite useful .",
    "if by means of a sufficiently high current the system is driven from one configuration to the other one , it also can happen that after turning off the current the system remains in the switched configuration , i.e. , the system does not return to the ground state .",
    "in the two - level energy diagram this would correspond to the case that the two schematic minima are separated by a high enough potential barrier and are of about the same energy .",
    "most theoretical investigations th-8,th-10,bjz98,th-9,th-6,th-7,th-12,th-2,th-4,th-1,th-5 were concerned about finding expressions for the interaction between the applied current and the orientation of the magnetic moments .",
    "almost all theoretical considerations and models used the concept of spin currents and had to use phenomenological parameters to relate the respective approach to the experimental evidence .",
    "quite clearly in most cases the main idea was to describe the cause for current induced switching and deal afterwards with the subsequent effect , namely a change in the magnetoresistance . therefore the effect  creating excited states  was interpreted in various ways by invoking spin waves , all kinds of spin - polarization effects , etc .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present paper to summarize the various theoretical approaches used up - to - now .    in here",
    "a completely different approach is pursued : the main idea is to calculate fully relativistically the twisting ( exchange interaction ) energy of a system as it goes from a parallel to an antiparallel configuration , or opposite .",
    "this is a continuous function of the relative angle between the orientations of the magnetization in the magnetic parts of a spin valve system . in keeping one orientation fixed and rotating the other one by an angle @xmath1 around an axis perpendicular to the fixed orientation one",
    "thus can switch continuously from say the parallel magnetic configuration to the antiparallel configuration . for",
    "each given rotation angle @xmath1 simultaneously the corresponding sheet resistance ( resistance divided by the unit area ) is calculated fully relativistically , which then is also a continuous function of the rotation angle .",
    "it should be noted that by using a fully relativistic approach the spin no longer is  an observable , i.e. , at a given angle @xmath1 there is just one sheet resistance . in adopting this approach ( 1 )",
    "the excitation energy is related to the rotation angle , and ( 2 ) for the same angle a physical observable , namely the sheet resistance is evaluated .",
    "therefore at a given @xmath1 the effect of the physical phenomenon is described , which then can be related to the cause , namely the turning on of a current .",
    "it will be shown later on that the twisting ( exchange interaction ) energy is the ab - initio analogon of the above mentioned two - level energy diagram for switching . furthermore , by means of relating the twisting energy and the corresponding sheet resistance to the current not only a critical current can be defined unambiguously , but also the complexity of the switching process becomes evident .",
    "quite clearly in this picture no dynamic effects can be calculated , although very good reasons for the occurrence of the telegraph noise can be given .",
    "the quantum mechanical tools applied are the fully relativistic screened korringa - kohn - rostoker method @xcite and the fully relativistic kubo - greenwood equation @xcite in the context of the local density functional approximation .",
    "all further reasoning is based on the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation , in terms of which switching times can be evaluated using ab - initio parameters .",
    "the introduced approach is applied to co / cu / co type spin valves and in fact will show quite a few of the experimentally observed features mentioned earlier .",
    "consider a typical trilayer system of the type fm / nm@xmath2/fm consisting of two semi - infinite magnetic leads ( fm ) and a so - called non - magnetic spacer ( nm ) such as for example co(100)/cu@xmath2/co(100 ) or equivalently co(100)/cu@xmath2/co@xmath3/vac , where @xmath4 denotes the number of spacer layers and @xmath5 is a sufficiently large number of layers of the magnetic metal .",
    "suppose now that @xmath6 denotes a particular unit vector ( reference orientation , either parallel or perpendicular to the surface normal ) characterizing the orientation of the magnetization in a particular atomic layer containing one atom per unit cell . if @xmath7 such a configuration is usually referred to as a parallel configuration , whereas for @xmath8 frequently the term `` symmetric '' antiparallel configuration is used .",
    "if @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( the orientations of the magnetization in the semi - infinite leads ) and the @xmath11 are each rotated by individual angles around an axis perpendicular to @xmath6 this situation refers to a general non - collinear magnetic configuration in two - dimensional translational invariant systems . as for reasonably large @xmath4",
    "the interior of the nm part is completely non - magnetic in the following specific non - collinear configurations of the type @xmath12 will be considered , where @xmath13 is a unit vector rotated by an angle @xmath1 with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "it is obvious that for these magnetic configurations it is sufficient to specify the rotation angle @xmath1 .",
    "expressed in simple terms this means that in the right half of the trilayer system the orientation of the magnetization is rotated uniformly by an angle @xmath1 with respect to the orientation of the magnetization in the left half .",
    "since a current perpendicular to the planes of atoms has to be described in the present paper the reference orientation @xmath6 is chosen to be parallel to the surface normal ( @xmath14 axis ) ; the rotations are performed around the @xmath15 axis .",
    "the energy difference between the two possible collinear states , namely the parallel and the `` symmetric '' antiparallel magnetic configuration , is usually termed interlayer exchange coupling energy . in using the magnetic force theorem @xcite the total energies of these states",
    "are replaced by the corresponding grand potentials ( at zero temperature ) , i.e. , by the so - called band energy difference @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the density of states for a particular configuration , @xmath20 the valence band bottom and @xmath21 the fermi energy . according to eq .",

    "is given by@xmath48 and the corresponding magnetoresistance by@xmath49 the difference in sheet resistances can again be expanded in a power series in @xmath24@xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "it will be shown later on that in most of the cases investigated in here @xmath52 i.e.,@xmath53      for @xmath54 , @xmath1  takes on its equilibrium value @xmath55 .",
    "as the current @xmath56 is turned on , the relative orientation of the two magnetic layers changes to @xmath1 .",
    "evidently , the work done to accomplish this rotation is @xmath57 .",
    "suppose that this energy difference is equal to the energy lost by the current in the form of a `` magnetic '' contribution to the joule s heat @xmath58,@xmath59 thus for a fixed current @xmath56,@xmath60 where @xmath61  is the time required to accomplish the rotation .",

    "are scalar positive definite quantities , the above construction is independent of the direction of the current flow .",
    "nevertheless , in the following , the concept of twisting energies @xmath65 and the corresponding magnetic joule s heat generated during a time interval @xmath61 shall be used to explore the physics of current induced switching . in short",
    ", evidence will be provided that the origin of the work done against the exchange forces acting between the two magnetic layers is the magnetic contribution to the energy dissipation from the current .",
    "it might seem that by using an energy flux relation the problem of evaluating the current @xmath56 was only shifted to yet another unknown quantity , namely to the characteristic time @xmath61 , whose theoretical description and evaluation therefore has to be the subject of the next few sections .",
    "furthermore , it has to be pointed out that any comparison with experimental data has to take into account also the actual area @xmath47 present in a given experiment .",
    "however , before going ahead to discuss these two quantities , the computational details of the ab - initio related parts of this paper shall be given .",
    "the effective scattering potentials and exchange fields of spin valve systems of the type fcc - co(100)/co@xmath67/cu@xmath2/co@xmath3/co(100 ) , @xmath68 , @xmath69 were determined selfconsistently using the fully relativistic spin - polarized screened korringa - kohn - rostoker method , th-15 where at least @xmath5  layers of co served as `` buffer '' to the semi - infinite leads .",
    "it should be noted that because of the special features of the applied screened structure constants @xcite the total number of atomic layers between the two semi - infinite systems has to be a multiple of three .",

    "@xmath186 the situation is even more dramatic , since @xmath27 has quite a large maximum at @xmath187 , the ap configuration being only slightly less energetically favored than the p configuration . in this particular system the meaning of the critical current is quite obvious : it simply is the maximum in the @xmath66 versus @xmath1 curve .",

    "the system with 26 cu spacer layers is in particular interesting , since a non - collinear configuration is the ground state . in this case",
    "a tiny current ( about 0.05 ma in this figure ) produces a magnetoresistance that can be either zero , 1.5 or about 6 % .",
    "it should be noted that the energy barrier between the ground state and the parallel configuration is minute : the system can almost freely oscillate between magnetic configurations for values of @xmath191 .",

    "are observed : the twisting energy can be described very well in terms of  @xmath195 ; in order to switch from parallel to antiparallel or vice versa a current of about 0.35 - 0.6 ma is needed .",

    "as can be seen the precessional changes in the twisting energy are very small indeed .",
    "this figure justifies _ a posteri _ the approach taken to evaluate and discuss the switching time @xmath197 .",
    "in viewing now all the various cases discussed above the following observations can be added : ( 1 ) if the slope of the magnetoresistance with respect to the current is uniformly positive ( negative ) , the parallel ( antiparallel ) magnetic configuration is favoured ( see , @xmath198 versus @xmath199 ) , ( 2 ) if it becomes approximately infinite at a certain current then a jump in the magnetoresistance occurs ( e.g. , @xmath200 ) , and ( 3 ) if this slope changes sign , a more complicated behavior pertains ( e.g. , @xmath201 ) . in the latter case",
    "the system either remains in the switched configuration ( @xmath202 ) or because of a non - collinear ground state oscillations in the magnetoresistance between zero and a few percent can occur when a very small current is applied ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "the so - called telegraph noise seems to refer to the jumping between such minima in the twisting energy , the jumping rates obviously being connected with the barrier between these minima .",
    "the current needed to switch a configuration from parallel to antiparallel ( or vice versa ) refers to the largest value of @xmath66 .",
    "the present results suggest that the efficiency of current - driven switching can considerably be optimized by varying the spacer thickness : theoretically in using a spacer thickness of about 43    ( 25 layers of cu ) perfect switching can be achieved such that the system remains in the switched state after the current is turned off .",
    "further theoretical investigations using the approach presented in here can include interdiffusion effects at interfaces or refer to different kinds of magnetic slabs ( leads ) such as for example permalloy , a system , which because of anisotropy effects in the magnetoresistance perhaps is even more complicated than the present co / cu / co trilayer .    altogether correlating the twisting energy and the corresponding resistance with the current yields a very consistent view of the complexity found in current - driven experiments .",
    "clearly enough this correlation suffers from the fact that up - to - now no quantum mechanical description for the gilbert damping factor was found and that a linear response theory ( kubo - greenwood equation ) is used to evaluate the electric transport properties , i.e. , that the current had to be formulated as a scalar quantity .    finally , it has to be remarked that the experimentally observed critical switching currents are by a factor of about 10 - 100 larger than the ones obtained in here .",
    "it has to be remembered , however , that in here an ideal co / cu / co trilayer was assumed while most experiments are based on rather complicated nanostructures such as for example nanopillars and therefore - although a consistent approach to was introduced in order to evaluate switching times in terms of ab - initio parameters - also the question of a comparable cross section ( unit area ) is of quite some importance .",
