    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is a theory of quantum cosmology based on the more general theory of loop quantum gravity  @xcite ( for reviews , see  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important predictions of lqc is the avoidance of the big - bang singularity , which is replaced by a bouncing universe  @xcite for isotropic models sourced by a massless scalar field .",
    "this result has been derived rigorously at the level of the quantum theory , but has also been understood at the level of approximate effective classical equations that capture the main features of the quantum dynamics .",
    "extending the rigorous quantum dynamics to the anisotropic bianchi i model is challenging .",
    "because of this , the dynamics of bianchi i in lqc have mostly been studied by extrapolating the approximate effective semi - classical equations that proved successful in the isotropic case . for matter with zero anisotropic stress ,",
    "the effective equations predict a bounce that avoids the classical singularity  @xcite , thus extending the results of the isotropic case .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the shear anisotropy does not blow up in the collapsing phase , but remain finite through the bounce .",
    "several ambiguities in the quantum construction of the hamiltonian constraint were considered  @xcite , one of which has since been favored by gauge considerations  @xcite and by a more thorough construction of the quantum theory  @xcite . with this choice of quantization scheme , it was shown that the anisotropic shear is in fact conserved across the bounce when the matter has zero anisotropic stress  @xcite .    in this paper , we couple a homogeneous magnetic field to a bianchi i universe and consider the effective semi - classical modifications to the equations of motion . we show that the singularity is still avoided via a bounce , during which anisotropies remain finite .",
    "however , the anisotropic stress in the magnetic field leads to a non - conservation of shear anisotropy through the bounce , in contrast to the case where of matter has zero anisotropic stress .",
    "the inclusion of a cosmological magnetic field breaks isotropy , so we consider an anisotropic bianchi cosmology , the simplest being the bianchi i model : ds^2 = - dt^2 + a_1 ^ 2(t ) dx^2 + a_2 ^ 2(t ) dy^2 + a_3 ^ 2(t ) dz^2 ,   h_i:=_i a_i .",
    "maxwell s equations are [ meq ] _ [ f _ ] = 0 , _ f^ = j^ , where @xmath0 is the four - current .",
    "the faraday tensor defines electric and magnetic fields relative to observers with four - velocity @xmath1  @xcite e_=f_u^ ,   b_= _ f^ , where @xmath2 is the alternating tensor in the observer s rest - space .",
    "we assume high conductivity in the early universe , so that the electric field is effectively zero , and maxwell s equations reduce to h_^_&= & ( _ -23h _ ) b^ , [ ind ] + h^_b_&= & 0 ,   _",
    "^b^= h_j^ , where @xmath3 projects into the rest - space , @xmath4 is the volume expansion and @xmath5 is the shear : = h_1+h_2+h_3=3a a ,   a^3:=a_1a_2a_3 ,   _ i^j=_i^j ( _ j a_j- a a ) .    for a homogeneous magnetic field in bianchi i , the divergence constraint is automatically satisfied , and the curl constraint shows that there is no 3-current . to solve the induction equation  , we assume without loss of generality that the magnetic field is aligned along the @xmath6-direction : @xmath7 .",
    "the solution is [ bt ] b_b^=^2 ( a_2a_3)^2 ,   b^1 = a^3 , where @xmath8 is constant , in agreement with  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor is given by t^f _ & = & - f _",
    "f^ _ - g _ f _ f^ + & = & _ b u_u_+ 13_b h _ + ^b _ , where the magnetic energy density and anisotropic stress are [ bra ] _ b=12b_b^ ,   ^b_= 13b_b^h_-b_b_.    for the case with only a magnetic field , the einstein field equations @xmath9 lead to  @xcite : h_1 + h_i & = & ,   i=2,3 , [ eq1 ] + h_1 ^ 2 a^6 & = & _ 2 _ 3 - 4 g ^2a_1 ^ 2 , where @xmath10 are constants .",
    "it follows that [ a1c ] _ 2_3>0 ,   a_1 a_1m= , and thus any expansion in the magnetic field direction will eventually come to rest at the maximum scale factor @xmath11 and turn around into a contracting phase .",
    "the solutions @xmath12 can be given analytically  @xcite : a & & ( 1 + f^2 ) f^- 1 ,   f(a_1 ) : = ,  : = , [ vofa1 ] + a_i & & ( 1 + f^2 ) f^_i/ , [ a2ofa1 ] where the @xmath13 refers to the expanding ( collapsing ) branches before ( after ) @xmath14 is reached .",
    "we can now analyze the singularity behavior of the general solutions . from eq .",
    ", the volume goes to zero or infinity when @xmath15 goes to zero , depending on the value of @xmath16 .",
    "there are two separate cases .",
    "the first is the axisymmetric case , @xmath17 , @xmath18 . from eqs .   and",
    ", the axisymmetric singularity is characterized by [ axising ] a_2= a_3 ,   a_1 , a 0 .",
    "directions orthogonal to the magnetic field freeze as the singularity is approached , while the magnetic field direction contracts to zero , along with the total volume .",
    "this singularity is present in all solutions for the axisymmetric case .",
    "the overall evolution is characterized by expansion in the direction of the magnetic field until @xmath11 is reached . after that , the @xmath15 direction contracts and reaches the singularity in finite proper time . for this type of evolution",
    ", past infinity is characterized by @xmath19 while @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , the time reversed scenario is possible .    the non - axisymmetric case is slightly more complicated , but again all trajectories are singular . in this case @xmath21 , and the singularity is characterized by [ nonaxising ] a_2 0 ,   a_3 |_2| > |_3| ,   a_1 , a 0 , and vice - versa if @xmath22",
    ". thus the singularities are again given by @xmath15 going to zero , with one of the orthogonal directions contracting to zero , while the other expands to infinity in such a way that @xmath23 still goes to zero .",
    "the loop quantum formulation is based on a hamiltonian framework where the gravitational degrees of freedom in the bianchi i model are encoded in three triad components @xmath24 and momentum components @xmath25 , related to the metric components as [ eqn : p and a ] p_1=a_2a_3 ,   p_2=a_1a_3 ,   p_3=a_1 a_2 ,  c_i = _ i , where @xmath26 is the real - valued barbero - immirzi parameter and represents an ambiguity parameter of loop quantum gravity .",
    "black hole entropy calculations can be used to fix its value . in terms of these variables ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given by [ hamiltonian ] h= ( c_2p_2c_3p_3+c_1p_1c_3p_3+c_1p_1c_2p_2)+ h_m , where @xmath27 is the matter contribution to the hamiltonian .",
    "einstein s equations can then be derived from hamilton s equations , which explicitly for this system are [ doteqs ] _",
    "i = -8 g , _ i = 8 g .",
    "the hamiltonian must also vanish for the system : h=0 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the matter contribution is proportional to the energy density of the matter , so the magnetic hamiltonian is given by h_b = a^3_b=. we will also consider a perfect fluid with constant equation of state @xmath28 .",
    "this can be added to the matter hamiltonian by first solving the conservation equation to give = ca^-3(1+w ) ,   h_fluid = c a^-3w , where @xmath29 is a constant .    analyzing the system at the level of the quantum difference equations of lqc",
    "for this model would be highly challenging , given the complexity of the bianchi i equations .",
    "we thus consider approximate semi - classical equations of motion that incorporate loop quantum modifications .",
    "these effective equations have been shown to be very good approximations for the case of isotropic cosmologies sourced by a massless scalar field  @xcite , and the results have been extrapolated to more complicated models .",
    "the corrections modify the general relativistic hamiltonian   to be of the form  @xcite [ heff ] h_eff= - \\",
    "{ p_2p_3 + } + h_m .",
    "the parameters @xmath30 are the key ingredients determining the quantum corrections .",
    "it is easy to see that in the limit @xmath31 , the classical hamiltonian   is recovered .",
    "the @xmath30 parameters are assumed to be functions of the triad components @xmath24 , and their precise specification is an ambiguity of the quantization .",
    "two possible constructions are discussed in  @xcite , although one of them has been argued to be more physical on the grounds of certain gauge invariance considerations in  @xcite and of a more rigorous construction of the quantum theory in  @xcite .",
    "we will focus on that scheme in this paper .",
    "the particular form is |_i = , where @xmath32 is a constant that is typically related to the minimum area gap of loop quantum gravity . in this paper",
    "we assume that @xmath33 in planck units ; the precise value will not affect the qualitative results .",
