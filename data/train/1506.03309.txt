    "the problem of estimating the number of real solutions of a system of polynomial equations is ubiquitous in mathematics and has obvious practical motivations .",
    "fundamental notions like the degree or mixed volume give good estimates for the number of complex solutions of polynomial systems .",
    "however , these estimates can be rough for the number of real solutions when the equations have few monomials or a special structure ( see  @xcite ) . in the case of a non - zero single polynomial in one variable ,",
    "this is a consequence of descartes rule of signs which implies that the number of real roots is bounded by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of non - zero terms of the polynomial .",
    "generalizations of descartes bound for polynomial and more general systems have been obtained by a. khovanskii  @xcite .",
    "the resulting bounds for polynomial systems have been improved by f. bihan and f. sottile  @xcite , but still very few optimal bounds are known , even in the case of two polynomial equations in two variables .",
    "polynomial systems in two variables where one equation has three non - zero terms and the other equation has @xmath4 three non - zero terms have been studied by t.y .",
    "rojas and x. wang  @xcite .",
    "they showed that such a system , allowing real exponents , has at most @xmath5 non - degenerate solutions contained in the positive orthant .",
    "this exponential bound has recently been refined into a polynomial one by p. koiran , n. portier and s. tavenas @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite also showed that for @xmath6 the sharp bound is five .",
    "systems of two trinomial equations with five non - degenerate solutions in the positive orthant are in a sense rare  @xcite .",
    "later m. avendao  @xcite considered systems of two polynomial equations in two variables , where the first equation has degree one and the other equation has @xmath4 non - zero terms .",
    "he showed that such a system has either an infinite number of real solutions or at most @xmath7 real solutions .",
    "here all solutions are counted with multiplicities , with the exception of the solutions on the real coordinate axis which are counted at most once .",
    "this reduces to counting the number of real roots of a polynomial @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 $ ] has at most @xmath4 non - zero terms .",
    "the question of optimality was not adressed in  @xcite and this was the motivation for the present paper .",
    "we prove the following result .",
    "[ mainth ] let @xmath10 $ ] be a polynomial with at most three non - zero terms and let @xmath11 be any real numbers .",
    "assume that the polynomial @xmath12 is not identically zero .",
    "then @xmath13 has at most @xmath14 real roots counted with multiplicities except for the possible roots 0 and @xmath15 that are counted at most once .    at a first glance this looks as a slight improvement of the main result of  @xcite .",
    "in fact , our bound is optimal at least for @xmath6 .",
    "[ t : optimal ] the maximal number of real intersection points of a real line with a real plane curve defined by a polynomial with three non - zero terms is eleven .    explicitly , the real curve with equation @xmath16 intersects the real line @xmath17 in precisely eleven points in @xmath18 .",
    "the strategy to construct this example is first to deduce from the proof of theorem [ mainth ] some necessary conditions on the monomials of the desired equation .",
    "then , the use of real grothendieck s dessins denfant  @xcite helps to test the feasibility of certain monomials .",
    "ultimately , computer experimentations lead to the precise equation .",
    "we present some results of m. avendao  @xcite and add other ones . consider a non - zero univariate polynomial @xmath19 with real coefficients . denote by @xmath20 the number of change signs in the ordered sequence @xmath21 disregarding the zero terms . recall that the famous descartes rule of signs asserts that the number of ( strictly ) positive roots of @xmath22 counted with multiplicities does not exceed @xmath20 .",
