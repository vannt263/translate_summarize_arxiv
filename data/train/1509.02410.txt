    "polaritons - hybrid quasiparticles originating from the strong coupling between light modes and matter excitations - represent an important research area , both for fundamental and practical reasons : their bosonic character may lead to bose - einstein condensation @xcite , and the larger coherence length of the light modes may enhance the carrier mobility in organic semiconductors @xcite . while originating primarily in quantum - optical settings such as josephson junctions and arrays of coupled cavities @xcite , polaritonic excitations are now also studied in molecular systems @xcite .",
