    "since @xcite , following early proposals by @xcite and @xcite , suggested that strange quark matter , consisting of @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-quarks is energetically the most favorable state of the matter , the problem of existence of strange quark stars has been intensively investigated in the physical and astrophysical literature .",
    "the possibility that some compact objects could be strange stars remains an interesting and intriguing , but still open question .",
    "@xcite also proposed two ways of formation of strange matter : the quark - hadron phase transition in the early universe and conversion of neutron stars into strange ones at ultrahigh densities . in the theories of strong interaction",
    "quark bag models suppose that breaking of physical vacuum takes place inside hadrons . as a result vacuum energy densities inside and outside",
    "a hadron become essentially different , and the vacuum pressure on the bag wall equilibrates the pressure of quarks , thus stabilizing the system . if the hypothesis of the quark matter is true , then some of neutrons stars could actually be strange stars , built entirely of strange matter @xcite ) . however , there are general arguments against the existence of strange stars @xcite . for an extensive review of strange star properties",
    "see @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of quark stars .",
    "quark stars are expected to form during the collapse of the core of a massive star after the supernova explosion , as a result of a first or second order phase transition , resulting in deconfined quark matter @xcite .",
    "the proto - neutron star core , or the neutron star core , is a favorable environment for the conversion of ordinary matter to strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that some neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries can accrete sufficient mass to undergo a phase transition to become strange stars @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has also been proposed as a source of radiation emission for cosmological @xmath3-ray bursts @xcite .",
    "some basic properties of strange stars like mass , radius , cooling , collapse and surface radiation have been also studied @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanisms of the transition from neutron matter to quark matter in an astrophysical background have been studied within several models .",
    "the first is due to @xcite , who used a non - relativistic diffusion model .",
    "as such , this is a slow combustion model , with the burning front propagating at a speed of approximately @xmath4 m/@xmath5 .",
    "this is determined primarily by the rate at which one of the down quarks inside the neutrons is converted , through a weak decay , to a strange quark : @xmath6 .",
    "the second method of describing the conversion process was first suggested by @xcite , and analyzed in detail by @xcite and @xcite , who modelled the conversion as a detonation . in this case",
    "the conversion rate is several orders of magnitude faster than that predicted by the slow combustion model .",
    "this model is based on the relativistic shock waves and combustion theory .",
    "but regardless of the way in which the transformation occurs , an initial seed of quark matter is needed to start the process .",
    "real neutron stars have two conserved charges- electric and baryonic .",
    "therefore , a neutron star has more than one independent component and in this sense it is a  complex \" system @xcite . the characteristics of a first - order phase transition , like the deconfinement transition , are very different in the two cases . in the  complex \" system the conserved charges can be shared by the two phases in equilibrium in different concentrations in each phase .",
    "the mixed phase , formed from hadrons and quarks can not exist in a simple body in the presence of the gravity because the pressure in that phase is a constant @xcite .",
    "this causes a discontinuity in the density distribution in the star occurring at the radius where gibbs criteria are satisfied . the isospin symmetry energy in neutron rich matter will exploit the degree of freedom of readjusting the charges between hadronic and quark phases in equilibrium so as to reduce the symmetry energy to the extent consistent with charge conservation .",
    "regions of hadronic matter will have a net positive charge neutralized by a net negative charge on the quark matter regions @xcite .",
    "coulomb repulsion will prevent the regions of like charge to grow too large , and the surface energy will act in the opposite sense in preventing them to become too small .",
    "consequently , the mixed phase will form a coulomb lattice so as to minimize the sum of coulomb and surface interface energy at each proportion of phases . as the quark phase becomes more abundant ,",
    "the droplets merge to form rods , rods merge to form slabs etc . @xcite .",
    "hence the actual geometric phase of quark nuggets in a neutron star evolves as a function of the pressure and of the surface energy between dense nuclear matter and quark matter .    in order to describe the process of formation and evolution of quark nuclei in the neutron",
    "stars one must use nucleation theory .",
    "the goal of nucleation theory is to compute the probability that a bubble or droplet of the @xmath7 phase appears in a system initially in the @xmath8 phase near the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "homogeneous nucleation theory applies when the system is pure .",
    "nucleation theory is applicable for first - order phase transitions when the matter is not dramatically supercooled or superheated .",
    "if substantial supercooling or superheating is present , or if the phase transition is second order , then the relevant dynamics is spinodal decomposition @xcite .",
    "the nucleation of strange quark matter inside hot , dense nuclear matter was investigated , with the use of zeldovich s kinetic theory of nucleation , by @xcite . by assuming that the newly formed strange quark matter bubble can be described by a simple bag model containing @xmath9 ultrarelativistic quarks , and by assuming that the time evolution of the radius of the bubble is described by an equation of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the critical radius of the bubble and @xmath12 the weak interaction time scale , the nucleation rate @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the critical quark number , @xmath16 is the surface tension of the bubble and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the particle number densities in the neutron and quark phase , respectively @xcite . in this way a lower bound for the temperature of the nucleation , @xmath19 , can be obtained .",
    "the effects of the curvature energy term on thermal strange quark matter nucleation have been considered by @xcite , who derived , within the same approach , the following expression for the nucleation rate : @xmath20    all the effects of the curvature enter only through the value of @xmath11 . as a general conclusion one obtains the result that even the curvature term acts against strange quark matter nucleation , the physical temperature of a just born proto - neutron star is , in any model , more than enough to drive an efficient boiling of the neutron material ( the observations of the neutrino flux from sn1987a are consistent with an effective temperature of @xmath21 mev ) . the possibility of stable strange quark matter ( both bulk and quasi - bulk ) at finite temperature , and some of its properties have been investigated , within the framework of the dynamical density - dependent quark mass model of confinement , by @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the surface tension and the stability of quark droplets at @xmath22 has also been discussed , with reference to strangelet formation in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "a different approach to the problem of thermal nucleation was taken by @xcite .",
    "they used the assumption ( standard in the theory of bubble nucleation in first - order phase transitions ) that bubbles form at a rate given by @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the minimum work required to form a bubble with radius @xmath25 . as a main result it follows that if the bag constant lies in the interval where three - flavor but not two - flavor quark matter is stable at zero pressure and temperature ( @xmath26 mev@xmath27 mev ) , then all or parts of a neutron star will be converted into strange matter , during the first second of its existence . for bag constant above the stability interval , a partial transformation is still possible @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the rate of formation of quark matter droplets in neutron stars from a combination of bubble formation rates in cold degenerate and high temperature matter , taking into account nuclear matter calculations of the viscosity and thermal conductivity .",
    "the droplet formation rate is that of @xcite , given by @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the statistical prefactor , which measures the phase - space volume of the saddle point around @xmath11 that the droplet has to pass , in its way to the lower energy state .",
    "@xmath30 is the quark correlation length .",
    "the dynamical prefactor determines the droplet growth rate and is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the enthalpy difference and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the thermal conductivity and the shear and bulk viscosities , respectively .",
    "the droplet formation rate can be expressed as @xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36 is the quark chemical potential in units of @xmath37 mev .",
    "the total number @xmath38 of droplets formed by nucleation is the integrated rate over the volume of the neutron star and the time after the nucleation process starts at the moment @xmath39 , @xmath40dt$ ] , where @xmath41 is the radius of the neutron star .",
    "the pressure and temperature depend sensitively on the equation of state of the nuclear and quark matter . to convert the core of the neutron star into quark matter",
    "at least one droplet must be formed , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "then , with the use of eq .",
    "( [ eqn ] ) , the condition for the formation of at least one droplet requires @xmath43 mev @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the core values of the pressure and temperature , respectively @xcite .",
    "the pressure and enthalpy difference depends strongly on the equation of state of nuclear and quark matter and hence the droplet formation rate can not be reliably estimated .",
    "the effect of subcritical hadron bubbles on an inhomogeneous first order quark - hadron phase transition was studied in @xcite .",
    "the transition from nuclear matter ( consisting of neutrons , protons and electrons ) to matter containing strangeness was considered , within a mean field type model and with the use of langer nucleation theory , by @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the time the new phase to appear at various densities and times in the cooling history of a protoneutron star was also given .",
    "on the other hand , as a result of an increase of the central density of the star , due for example to accretion or spinning down , a metastable , super - compressed neutron phase can appear , with a star consisting of the new phase surrounded by normal neutron matter @xcite .",
    "this situation is similar to a gas undergoing a phase transition to its liquid state if compressed to a volume @xmath47 at fixed @xmath48 .",
    "if it is slowly compressed , it may stay in the vapor state even for @xmath49 ( similar examples are liquid water freed of dissolved air which may be heated above boiling temperature without the formation of vapor and cooled below freezing temperature without solidification ) . the transition from the super - compressed neutron phase to the quark phase can take place in a very long time , which in some cases can be longer than the estimated life of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "therefore an increase in the density of the neutron star does not automatically lead to the transition to quark matter inside the star .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on the quark star structure and on the nucleation process of the quark bubbles has been studied in @xcite . in the presence of strong magnetic fields the equation of state of strange quark",
    "matter changes significantly .",
    "the strange stars become more compact , the magnetic field reducing the mass and radius of the star .",
    "the surface energy and the curvature term of the quark phase both diverge , with the surface tension diverging logarithmically , while the curvature term diverges much faster .",
    "therefore the thermal nucleation of quark bubbles in a compact metastable state of neutron matter is completely forbidden in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "these results for the formation of quark bubbles in neutron matter have been obtained by using the csernai and kapusta theory of nucleation @xcite and its extension including the thermal conductivity of dense matter @xcite .",
    "in this theory both the hadron and quark materials are considered as substances with zero baryonic number , and are treated by using a relativistic formalism . the principal result in this approach is the suggestion that the prefactor @xmath50 is proportional to the transport coefficients ( viscosity and thermal conductivity ) of the neutron matter , and thus when these coefficients vanish a quark bubble necessarily does not form .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the energy flow does not vanish in absence of any heat conduction or viscous damping .",
    "since the change of energy density @xmath51 in time is given , in the low velocity limit , by the conservation equation @xmath52 @xcite , where @xmath53 is the enthalpy and @xmath54 the velocity , this implies that the energy flow @xmath55 is always present .",
    "therefore , an expression for the prefactor can be derived , which does not vanish in the absence of viscosity .",
    "the viscous effects cause only a small perturbation to the prefactor .",
    "the differences between the csernai - kapusta ( ck ) @xcite and ruggieri - friedman ( rf ) @xcite results are due to the technical differences in the treatment of the pressure gradients .",
    "a generalized approach , following the ck formalism leading to the prefactor in both viscous and non - viscous regimes was developed by @xcite . unlike in @xcite ,",
    "the linearized relativistic hydrodynamics equations have been solved in all regions .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to extend the zeldovich nucleation theory for the formation of quark droplets in neutron matter , by taking into account both the effects of the energy flow and of thermal conductivity , shear and bulk viscosities . as a result",
    "a more general expression for the quark matter droplet rate formation can be obtained , which is also valid in the limiting case of vanishing conductivity and viscosity coefficients . in the nucleation theory of @xcite , the transition from the neutron to quark state",
    "is possible only for a normal matter having viscous properties . for zero bulk and",
    "shear viscosities the transition is impossible .",
    "this assumption is , however , to restrictive , and the transition can also take place for a perfect ( no viscosity or heat conduction ) neutron matter fluid .",
    "we also derive the expression of the rate formation for this case .",
    "an alternative point of view of the transformation of neutron matter into strange matter can be developed if one assumes that the conversion process is endothermic . in this case",
    "the strange quark matter formation inside a neutron star is triggered by an external source of energy ( accretion from the companion star or spin - down ) .",
    "pulsars are born with an enormous angular momentum and rotational energy , which they radiate over a long period of time via electromagnetic radiation and electron - positron pair emission . when rotating rapidly , a pulsar is centrifugally flattened . with decreasing angular velocity the central density of the star is increasing and",
    "may attain the critical density necessary for a phase transition .",
    "first at the center and then in an expanding region the neutron matter will be converted to a highly compressible quark matter phase @xcite .",
    "the conversion of neutron matter to quark matter alters the moment of inertia of the star , and the epoch over which conversion takes place will be signaled in the spin - down characteristics of the pulsar . a measurable quantity",
    ", the braking index @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the angular velocity of the star , could be an observational indicator of the slow transition from neutron to quark phase @xcite . by using the formalism developed for the nucleation of quark matter we reconsider the idea of phase transition from neutron matter to quark matter in rotating compact stellar objects , by assuming that the nucleation and the growth of the quark droplets and the formation of a quark core in a neutron star is a result of the transfer of the gravitational energy to the quark droplets , due to the spinning down of the rapidly rotating neutron star .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the nucleation kinetics of strange matter bubbles is considered , within the framework of the zeldovich nucleation theory , in section ii .",
    "the expressions for the rate of formation of quark matter are derived , in both the perfect and dissipative neutron fluid case , in section iii .",
    "the transition of a neutron star to a quark star , due to increase of the central density as a result of the spinning down is considered in section iv . in section",
    "v we discuss and conclude our results .",
    "we consider that the change from the metastable neutron phase to the stable quark phase occurs as the result of fluctuations in a homogeneous medium , formed of neutrons , in which small quantities of the quark phase ( called bubbles or nuclei ) are randomly generated .",
    "since the process of creation of an interface is energetically unfavorable , it follows that when a quark nucleus is below a certain size , it is unstable and disappears again .",
    "surface effects disfavor the survival of small bubbles below the radius @xmath11 ( called critical size - the nuclei of this size are called critical nuclei or bubbles ) , which is nothing but the value that extremizes the thermodynamical work @xmath58 necessary to create the bubbles . only nuclei whose size @xmath59 is above the value @xmath11 are stable , and can survive @xcite .",
    "the nuclei are assumed to be macroscopic objects containing a large number of particles ( quarks ) .    for strongly degenerate neutron matter the thermodynamic work @xmath58 necessary to create a quark bubble is @xcite @xmath60 \\frac{4\\pi } { 3}r^{3}+4\\pi \\sigma r^{2}+8\\pi \\gamma r+e_{c},\\ ] ] where @xmath61 are the pressures of the quark matter and neutron matter ( exterior to the bubble , assumed to be spherical ) , @xmath16 is the surface tension , @xmath18 is the particle - number density of quark matter , @xmath62 are the chemical potentials of each phase , @xmath3 is the curvature coefficient and @xmath63 is the coulomb energy of the droplet @xcite . here @xmath64 is the excess charge of the droplet with volume @xmath65 compared with the surrounding medium , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the charge densities of the quark and nuclear matter , respectively",
    ". therefore the coulomb energy of the droplet is given by @xmath68 .",
    "assuming that the quark matter is immersed in a uniform background of electros , and that it is in @xmath69 equilibrium , with @xmath70 , it follows that the total electric charge in the quark phase can be expressed as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "generally @xmath73 .",

    "hence the curvature coefficient is given by @xmath77 mev@xmath78 @xcite .",

    "the coulomb correction has the effect of increasing the critical radius .",

    "the fluctuational development of nuclei in this range can still , with high probability , throw them back into the subcritical range , but nuclei beyond the critical range will inevitably develop into the new quark phase .",

    "magnetars are compact objects with super strong magnetic fields of the order @xmath229 gauss or even higher @xcite .",
    "it is now believed that soft gamma repeaters ( sgr s ) - a small class ( 4 confirmed and one candidate ) of high energy transient discovered through their emission of bright x - ray/@xmath3-ray bursts , which repeat on timescales of seconds to years - are magnetars .",
    "there is evidence that the giant sgr flares involve the cooling of a confined @xmath230-photon plasma in an ultrastrong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite have suggested that sgr s are strange stars , motivated in part by the super - eddington luminosities of their giant flares .",
    "the magnetars differ from the canonical pulsars ( with low magnetic fields of the order @xmath231 gauss ) in the sense that they spin down much more rapidly .",
    "if we assume that the spin - down of the magnetar is completely determined by the torque of its relativistic wind emission , generated via the magnetic dipole radiation , then the time variation of the angular velocity @xmath57 of the star is given by @xcite @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the moment of inertia of the star and @xmath234 is the magnetic dipole moment . when the star is born with a spin period much shorter that the observed one , the age of the star is the spin - down age @xmath235 , where @xmath236 and @xmath237 are the present spin period and its time derivative .",

    "therefore in a magnetar density changes , due to the spin - down , take place in a short interval of time .",
    "hence they can provide enough energy to trigger spontaneous nucleation to the quark phase , once the central density of the star goes above the critical density .",
    "the nucleation of quark droplets in the presence of strong magnetic fields essentially depends on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the energy of a quantum particle changes significantly if the magnetic field is of the order or exceeds the critical value @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is the mass of the particle . for electrons",
    "the value of the critical field is @xmath257 g. in order to calculate the value of the critical magnetic field for quarks we have to use the estimations for the quark masses .",
    "however , there are many uncertainties in the numerical values of the quark masses , which play an essential role in the calculation of the critical magnetic field and which are generally poorly known . in the case of free quarks ,",
    "the current quark mass is considered to be in the range of @xmath258 mev .",
    "then the corresponding critical magnetic field is @xmath259 g. for the current quark mass , this is the typical strength of the magnetic field at which the cyclotron lines begin to occur . in this limit",
    "the cyclotron quantum is of the order or greater than its rest energy .",
    "this is equivalent to the requirement that the de broglie wavelength is of the order or greater than the larmor radius of the particle in the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , from the physical point of view a better description of the quark mass can be obtained by using instead the current quark mass the effective or constitute quark mass , which takes into account the effects of the strong interactions , and which is of the order @xmath260 mev @xcite .",
    "the critical magnetic field corresponding to the effective quark mass could be as high as @xmath261 g.    the study of the behavior of the surface and curvature energy terms in strong magnetic fields have shown that both quantities diverge for @xmath262 , with the curvature term diverging much faster .",
    "consequently , in the presence of strong magnetic fields the rate of stable quark droplet formation per unit volume @xmath263 tends to zero , @xmath264 , and therefore there can not be any thermal nucleation of quark droplets in neutron star cores @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath8 inside a magnetar is not known , and it is not certain if the interior magnetic field is much stronger than the surface field .",
    "if in the interior of the magnetar the value of the magnetic field can exceed the critical value @xmath265 g , which represents the most conservative estimation of the critical magnetic field , corresponding to the free quark mass @xmath266 mev , then the rate of droplet formation can be considerably reduced and the transition from neutron matter to quark matter could not take place .    on the other hand , by taking into account that the physical mass of the quark is the effective mass , the corresponding critical magnetic field could be of the order @xmath267 g , value which could be higher than the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the magnetars .",
    "for magnetic fields smaller than @xmath268 , the endothermic nucleation process can take place in a short time interval during the spin - down of the magnetar .",
    "in the present paper we have considered a kinetic theory of strange matter nucleation in neutron stars .",
    "we derived general necessary conditions for neutron to quark matter conversion .",
    "there have been several assumptions made in the derivation of the results , mostly related to the form of the growth speed of the bubble .",
    "the result is valid only if non - linear effects can be ignored , and the linearized hydrodynamic equations are applicable .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed that the radii of the bubbles are larger than the correlation length and that heating due to dissipation is slow , causing the temperature to vary slowly across the bubble wall .",
    "we also considered that the phase transition is strongly first order , releasing considerably heat .",
    "the growth of the critical size quark bubbles nucleated in the first order transition in the neutron star core is governed by the dynamical prefactor @xmath269 .",
    "there are several expressions for the prefactor obtained in the physical literature . in the csernai - kapusta approach @xcite",
    ", the prefactor essentially depends on the dissipative properties ( shear , bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity ) of neutron matter .",
    "therefore , in a non - viscous medium with @xmath270 , the growth of the quark bubbles can not take place .",
    "the main physical assumption is that the energy flow is provided by the viscous effects only .    on the contrary",
    ", one can argue that the energy flow does not vanish in absence of heat conduction or viscous damping @xcite . in this case , and in the limit of zero viscosity , the prefactor depends only on two scale parameters , the correlation length @xmath34 and the critical radius of the quark bubble @xmath11 . for a viscous medium",
    "the prefactor can simply be written as the sum of the viscous and non - viscous term , with the viscous term not affecting the growth process significantly .",
    "the previous ( viscous ) results can be reobtained by using some assumptions for the velocity of sound in the medium around the saddle configuration .",
    "the condition for the formation of at least quark bubble in the neutron matter as a result of the thermal fluctuation is given by eq .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "the condition includes both the cases of viscous and ideal neutron matter .",
    "it is extremely sensitive with respect to the numerical values of the microscopic parameters characterizing the quark bubble , like the surface tension @xmath16 , the bag constant @xmath8 or the curvature coefficient @xmath271 . in discussing the astrophysical implications of the expression ( [ cond1 ] )",
    "we shall consider separately the two limiting cases , corresponding to viscous and non - viscous neutron matter , respectively .",
    "in the case of ideal neutron matter , the condition of the formation of a quark bubble is given by eq .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "this equation determines at which temperature the phase transition takes place .",
    "for example , in the case of the walecka mean field equation of state @xcite , with @xmath272 and @xmath273 @xcite , the temperature @xmath46 necessary for the formation of a stable quark bubble in a second ( @xmath274 s ) , in a volume @xmath275 with radius @xmath276 km ( @xmath277 km@xmath278 ) , and at the center of the neutron star , is around @xmath279 mev , for @xmath280 mev@xmath281 .",
    "here we have also assumed the standard values for the quark matter chemical potential and for the bag constant , @xmath282 mev and @xmath283 mev@xmath92 @xcite .",
    "since the temperature of a newborn neutron star is around @xmath4 mev @xcite , this value of the surface tension seems to rule out , for the given equation of state , the possibility of formation of quark nuclei in the neutron matter .",
    "however , a small variation in the value of @xmath16 , @xmath284 mev@xmath285 reduces the temperature for quark nuclei formation to @xmath286 mev , a value which does not exclude the possibility that quark nuclei formation can be initiated in the early stages of the neutron star evolution .",
    "smaller values of @xmath16 , of the order of @xmath287 mev@xmath281 , can lower even more the phase transition temperature , making it possible even for cold neutron stars .",
    "the transition temperature is relatively insensitive to the details of the equation of state of the dense neutron matter .",
    "if the temperature at which the phase transition is initiated is strongly dependent by the microscopic model adopted for describing the neutron matter properties , the total transition time of the neutron star to a quark star , given by eq .",
    "( [ conv ] ) , is much less dependent on the details of the equation of state or the exact numerical values of the surface tension or curvature of the bubble .",
    "generally , for a neutron star with radius @xmath288 km , the conversion time is very long , of the order of @xmath289 years for @xmath290 mev@xmath281 . for @xmath291 mev@xmath281 or even lower ,",
    "the conversion time could have values of the order of @xmath292 years , which are still of the same order of magnitude as the lifetime of a neutron star ( @xmath292 years ) .",
    "hence , in the present approach , which is limited to the consideration of linear effects only in the hydrodynamic description of the first order phase transitions for an ideal neutron fluid , the growth of the quark nuclei is very slow .",
    "therefore the results of the present analysis suggest that even quark nuclei could appear inside the neutron star at a very early stage , the transition to a pure quark phase ends only in the final stage of its evolution .    if the neutron matter - quark matter phase transition is mainly driven by viscous processes , like in the csernai - kapusta scenario , then the time necessary for a neutron star to convert to a quark star follows from eqs .",
    "( [ k1 ] ) and ( [ tconv ] ) . in order to numerically estimate the conversion time , we need an estimation of viscosity and conduction coefficients of nuclear matter .",
    "we shall also consider two limiting cases for the phase transition .",
    "below the critical density @xmath293 g/@xmath294 , cold neutron matter consists of two distinct phases . at low density ,",
    "neutron star matter consists of nuclei which form a solid lattice for temperatures below the melting temperature and a sea of relativistic electrons . when the density reaches @xmath295 g/@xmath294",
    ", neutrons begin to  drip  from the neutron - rich nuclei and then , in addition to the relativistic electrons there is a sea of non - relativistic neutrons . at the critical density the neutron - rich nuclei dissolve , leaving seas of degenerate neutrons , protons and electrons .",
    "the neutrons in cold neutron star matter are quite likely superfluid , and therefore the transport coefficients are dominated by electrons , with the motion of electron determined by electron - electron and electron - proton scattering @xciteas a result the viscosity is much lower , but the thermal conductivity is only slightly smaller as compared to the case in which both neutrons and protons form normal fluids @xcite .",
    "hence , we can neglect the viscosity coefficients with respect to the thermal conductivity and approximate @xmath140 by @xmath296 , with @xmath297 @xcite .",
    "a slightly different expression for the leading term in thermal conductivity has been proposed in @xcite , @xmath298 , with @xmath299 @xmath92 and @xmath300 @xmath92 .",
    "hence , by using this last expression , we obtain for @xmath176 @xmath301    the transition time is independent of the temperature of the neutron matter .",
    "it depends only on the microscopic properties of the quark bubble ( surface tension and curvature coefficient ) , density and the equation of state of the matter inside the star . for @xmath302 mev and @xmath283 mev@xmath92 and for @xmath290 mev@xmath281 eq .",
    "( [ therm ] ) gives , for a neutron star with radius @xmath303 km and for several equations of state values of the conversion time of the order @xmath304 years .    in the case of young and hot neutron stars ,",
    "the main dissipative mechanism which could drive the phase transition is the shear viscosity of the neutron matter .",
    "the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity coefficient can be approximated by @xmath305 , with @xmath306 mev@xmath307/@xmath170 @xcite .",
    "consequently , by neglecting the heat conduction and the bulk viscosity , the conversion time becomes @xmath308      in fig .",
    "1 we have represented @xmath176 given by eq .",
    "( [ shear ] ) as a function of temperature , for different equations of state of neutron matter .",
    "we have considered four equations of state , namely , the equation of state ( eos ) of the free neutron gas @xcite , the bethe - johnson eos @xcite , the lattimer - ravenhall eos @xcite and the walecka eos @xcite . in all cases we calculated the conversion time for a neutron star with radius @xmath309 km .",
    "as one can see from the figure , in this case the conversion time is much shorter as compared to the ideal neutron matter case or thermal conduction driven phase transition .",
    "@xmath176 is rapidly decreasing with the temperature .",
    "for a neutron star with rapidly cooling processes , e.g. direct urca process , kaon condensation etc .",
    ", the stellar temperature can decrease to less than @xmath310mev in a time scale of @xmath311 yr @xcite . according to fig .",
    "1 , the conversion can take place in a time scale less than @xmath312 yr if the spin - down time scale is less than this time scale .",
    "this can be case if this neutron star is a magnetar .",
    "we should point out that the interior of magnetars are not quantum liquid , i.e. superfluid or superconducting , because the strong magnetic field can destroy the nucleon cooper pairs @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the neutrons and protons are superfluid , then the transport properties are determined completely by electron - electron scattering .",
    "in fact in this case the viscosity of the nuclear fluid is given by @xmath313 t^{2}$ ] @xcite , where @xmath314 is the fine structure constant , @xmath315 is the thomas - fermi wave vector , and @xmath316 , @xmath317 and @xmath318 are the electron mass , momentum and energy , respectively .",
    "we assume that the electron gas inside the neutron star is extreme relativistic and strongly degenerate .",
    "then it follows that @xmath319 @xcite , with @xmath320 the fermi momentum and @xmath321 the electron number density .",
    "since @xmath321 can be related to the total particle number @xmath322 by means of the relation @xmath323 , with @xmath324 the mean number of electrons per baryon , it follows that @xmath325 .",
    "hence we obtain for the shear viscosity coefficient of the nuclear matter @xmath326 ^{2}+\\left [ \\frac{m_{e}\\left ( 8\\pi \\right ) ^{1/3}}{\\left ( 3y_{e}n_{0}\\right ) ^{1/3}\\left ( n / n_{0}\\right ) ^{1/3}}\\right ] ^{4}\\right\\ } t^{2}.\\ ] ]      in this case , since the viscosity of the superfluid nuclear matter is much smaller , the conversion time is longer than for a nuclear fluid dominated by the neutron viscosity .",
    "however , in this case the phase transition from neutron matter to quark matter can also take place at very low temperatures .",
    "consequently , a very short @xmath176 , of the order of hours or a few days , is also allowed in the framework of this model .",
    "it is widely accepted that at asymptotic densities the ground state of qcd with @xmath328 is the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite . in this phase , color gauge symmetry",
    "is completely broken , as are both chiral symmetry and baryon number .",
    "the effective coupling is weak and the low - energy properties can be determined by using methods from the theory of superconductivity . for large gaps @xmath329 ,",
    "the cfl phase is rigorously electrically neutral , despite the unequal quark masses , and even in the presence of electron chemical potential .",
    "the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter via bubble nucleation may be greatly simplified if the transition occurs directly to quark matter in the cfl phase @xcite . for a given baryonic chemical potential @xmath330 , electrically neutral nuclear matter and electrically neutral quark matter",
    "have different values of the electronic chemical potential @xmath331 .",
    "since @xmath331 must be continuous across any interface , a mixed phase region is formed , within which positively charged nuclear matter and and negatively charged quark matter with the same @xmath332 coexist at any given radius .",
    "the growth of the quark droplets is at the expense of the nuclear matter .",
    "however , if the quark matter is in the cfl phase , an interface between bulk nuclear matter with non - zero electron number @xmath333 and cfl quark matter with @xmath334 may be stable , as long as @xmath331 satisfies the condition @xmath335 , with @xmath336 the variation of the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "therefore , the existence of the cfl phase supports the idea that in neutron stars quark matter and baryonic matter may be continuously connected .",
    "then the growth of the interface between the neutron and cfl quark phase could be the result of exterior energy absorption , via an endothermic mechanism .    in summary , by using the kinetic nucleation theory we have considered the possibility that the neutron matter - quark matter phase transition could be triggered by the gravitational energy released during the spin - down of a pulsar .",
    "this process could take place in a very short time interval , of the order of few tens seconds , in a class of dense compact objects , with very high magnetic fields , called magnetars .",
    "however , the percentage of neutron star matter that can be converted into quark matter depends on the initial period , the neutron star mass and on the equation of state of the neutron and quark phases .",
    "an important and open issue is how could we determine if such a process is taking place or took already place in some pulsars or magnetars , and what are the observational signatures of the endothermic neutron matter - quark matter transition .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to know if such a process could be a possible gamma - ray burst mechanism , as suggested by @xcite .",

    "<S> we consider the general conditions of quark droplets formation in high density neutron matter . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of the quark bubble ( assumed to contain a sufficiently large number of particles ) can be described by means of a fokker - planck equation . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the nucleation essentially depends on the physical properties of the medium it takes place . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions for quark bubble formation are analyzed within the frameworks of both dissipative and non - dissipative ( with zero bulk and shear viscosity coefficients ) approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the conversion time of the neutron star to a quark star is obtained as a function of the equation of state of the neutron matter and of the microscopic parameters of the quark nuclei . as an application of the obtained formalism </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the first order phase transition from neutron matter to quark matter in rapidly rotating neutron stars cores , triggered by the gravitational energy released during the spinning down of the neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> the endothermic conversion process , via gravitational energy absorption , could take place , in a very short time interval , of the order of few tens seconds , in a class of dense compact objects , with very high magnetic fields , called magnetars . </S>"
