    "in the absence of constraints on the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 any metric satisfies einstein s equations since they can be regarded as a definition of @xmath3 , i.e. , a set of equations determining @xmath2 for any given metric @xmath4 . however , if one wishes to explore general properties that hold for a variety of different physical sources it is convenient to impose the so - called _ energy conditions _ that limit the arbitrariness of @xmath2 on physical grounds.@xcite    on scales relevant for cosmology , an important point in the study of the energy conditions is the confrontation of their predictions with the observational data . by using model - independent energy - condition",
    "_ integrated _ bounds on the cosmological observables as , for example , the distance modulus and lookback time , this confrontation has been made in some recent articles@xcite@xcite ( see also the pioneering refs .   by visser ) . in ref .",
    ", however , it was shown that the fulfillment ( or the violation ) of these _ integrated _ bounds at a specific redshift @xmath5 is not a sufficient ( nor a necessary ) _ local _ condition for the fulfillment ( or respectively the violation ) of the associated energy condition at @xmath5.gravity have also been investigated in ref .   and more recently in refs .   and . ] in this way , the confrontation between the prediction of these _ integrated _ bounds and observational data can not be used to draw conclusions on the fulfillment ( or violation ) of the energy conditions at @xmath5 . in ref .",
    "this problem was overcome by deriving new _ non - integrated _ energy - condition bounds , and confrontations between the new bounds with type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) data of the _ _ gold__@xcite and _ _",
    "combined__@xcite samples were performed by using the upper and lower limits of confidence regions on @xmath6 plane .",
    "more recently , in ref .",
    "a new statistical way for estimating the deceleration parameter @xmath7 was carried out , and a new picture of the energy conditions fulfillment and violation for recent past ( @xmath8 ) was calculated by using the recently compiled _ union _",
    "sample.@xcite    in this work , we use the most recent statistical procedure introduced in ref .   along with the _ _ gold__@xcite and _ _ combined__@xcite samples to obtain estimates of @xmath0 in order to build up a new picture of the confrontation between the energy condition _ integrated _ bounds and these sne ia data sets , completing therefore the cycle of this type of analysis which involves these three samples and the two statistical procedures to @xmath0 estimates of refs . and .",
    "it is known that the energy conditions can be stated in a coordinate - invariant way in terms of @xmath2 and vector fields of fixed character ( timelike , null and spacelike ) . however , within the framework of the standard friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model , we only need to consider the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid with density @xmath9 and pressure @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 . in this context , the energy conditions take the following forms:@xcite @xmath12 where nec , wec , sec and dec correspond , respectively , to the null , weak , strong , and dominant energy conditions . for a flrw metric with a scale factor @xmath13 , the density @xmath9 and pressure @xmath14 of the cosmological fluid",
    "are given by @xmath15 \\qquad   \\text{and } \\qquad p =   - \\frac{1}{8\\pi g}\\left[\\ , 2\\,\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a } + \\frac{\\dot{a}^2}{a^2 } + \\frac{k}{a^2 } \\,\\right ] \\;,\\ ] ] where overdots denote the derivative with respect to the time @xmath16 and @xmath17 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the _ non - integrated _ bounds from energy conditions derived in ref .   can be obtained in terms of the deceleration parameter @xmath18 , the normalized hubble function @xmath19 , and the curvature density parameter @xmath20 , simply by substituting eqs .   into eqs .  .",
    "this gives , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . ]",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the redshift , @xmath26 , and the subscript 0 stands for present - day quantities .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the flrw flat ( @xmath27 ) universe .",
    "in this case the * nec * , * sec * and * dec * bounds reduce , respectively , to @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , while the * wec * bound is fulfilled identically .",
    "thus , having estimates of @xmath31 for different redshifts @xmath32 , one can test the fulfillment or violation of the energy conditions at each @xmath33 .",
    "now , the @xmath31 estimates are obtained by using a sne ia data set , by approximating the deceleration parameter @xmath0 function as the following linear piecewise continuous function : @xmath34 where the subscript @xmath35 means that the quantity is taken at @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "the supernovae observations provide the redshifts and distance modulus @xmath38 + 25 \\;.\\ ] ] then , by using the following well known relation between @xmath0 and @xmath39 : @xmath40 along with eq .  , we fitted the parameters of the @xmath0 , as given by , by using the sne ia redshift  distance modulus data from the _ _ gold__@xcite and _ _ combined__@xcite samples .",
    "since in the flat case the energy condition bounds given by eqs .  , and",
    "depend only on @xmath0 , we have obtained the @xmath41 estimates at @xmath42 confidence levels from _ gold _ and _ combined _ sne ia samples by marginalizing over @xmath43 and the other parameters ( @xmath44 s ) of the @xmath0 function [ eq.([eq : q_z ] ) ] .    a global picture of the breakdown and fulfillment of the energy conditions in the recent past has been built up with the @xmath31 estimates at 200 equally spaced redshifts in the interval @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "[ qxz](a ) shows the * nec * , * sec * , and * dec * bounds along with the best - fit values and the @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 limits of @xmath31 in the @xmath49 plane .",
    "we recall that * wec * bound [ @xmath50 is fulfilled identically .        in fig .  [ qxz ]",
    "it is showed that the * sec * bound is violated with @xmath46 confidence level until @xmath51 for _ gold _ and @xmath52 for _ combined _ sample , while in the redshift intervals @xmath53 [ panel ( a ) ] and @xmath54 [ panel ( b ) ] this violation occurs with more than @xmath48 confidence level , where the highest evidence is found at @xmath55 with @xmath56 [ _ gold _ , panel ( a ) ] and @xmath57 [ _ combined _ , panel ( b ) ] . unlike the result of ref .  , wherein these analyses have been performed by computing the confidence regions on the @xmath58 plane , revealing no redshift value for the * sec * fulfillment with at least @xmath46 , we note here the * sec * is fulfilled with more than @xmath46 for @xmath59 [ _ gold _ , panel ( a ) ] and @xmath60 [ _ combined _ , panel ( b ) ] . according to the present * sec * analysis , with @xmath46 confidence level , the universe crosses over from a decelerated expansion phase to an accelerated expansion during the redshift interval @xmath61 for _ gold _ and @xmath62 for _ combined _ sample . ) . ]    regarding the * nec * , fig .",
    "[ qxz ] indicates its breakdown within @xmath48 confidence level for low redshift , @xmath63 [ panel ( a ) ] and @xmath64 [ panel ( b ) ] . for higher values of redshift ,",

    "finally , we note that the * dec * violation of the present analysis is weaker than that obtained in ref .   in the sense",
    "that , differently from that analysis , now the * dec * is fulfilled with @xmath46 confidence level in the entire redshift interval for both samples .",
