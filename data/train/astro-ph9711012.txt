    "scintillation studies provide us with a powerful tool for determining conditions along the line - of - sight to a particular pulsar .",
    "they have the potential to determine both the strength of the scattering process and the location of the dominant scattering screen and have been extremely successful in determining some properties of the interstellar medium ( cordes et al .",
    "1991 ; gupta 1995 ) . in binary pulsars which are interacting with their companion stars , such as the ablating millisecond pulsars ,",
    "scatter broadening provides us with a vital clue in understanding the eclipse mechanisms ( luo & melrose 1995 ) .",
    "we present observations and interpretation of the scintillation parameters for the binary pulsar 259 , the only known radio pulsar with a be star companion .",
    "259 was identified as a pulsar in a highly eccentric ( @xmath3 ) , 3.4 yr orbit with the @xmath4 be - star , ss2883 ( johnston et al.1992 ) .",
    "optical observations determined that ss2883 is of spectral type b2e , and also suggested that the system is at a distance @xmath51.5 kpc , placing the pulsar in or just beyond the sagittarius - carina spiral arm ( johnston et al .",
    "be stars are characterized by a circumstellar disk of cool , dense material , which extends outward from the equator to a few tens of stellar radii , and a hot , low - density polar wind .",
    "observations of the pulsar have shown that dispersion measure ( dm ) variations around the orbit are @xmath6 @xmath7pc , except close to periastron where the dm increases by @xmath015 @xmath7pc . at this time the pulsar undergoes extreme scatter broadening at frequencies up to at least @xmath8 ( johnston et al .",
    "the increased dm and the scatter broadening can be explained by the line - of - sight to the pulsar traversing the be star s wind and disk ( melatos , johnston , & melrose 1995 ) .",
    "259 thus potentially provides us with a probe of the wind structure of a be star ( far from periastron ) and the disk structure ( close to periastron ) .    a priori",
    ", one can think of four potential locations for the scattering material : the general interstellar medium , dense material within the spiral arm , an  bubble around the hot star , or the wind / disc of the be star . in this paper",
    "we examine each of these possibilities in turn .",
    "we made a total of 46 independent observations of 259 between 1993 august and 1997 february using the parkes 64-m radio telescope .",
    "this excludes data taken in 1993 december and 1994 january during the periastron passage of the pulsar ( johnston et al .",
    "the observations were made at .8 and .4 using dual - channel , cryogenically cooled systems sensitive to two orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "the signals from the receivers were down - converted to an intermediate frequency and then passed into a back - end filterbank which consisted of a number of contiguous frequency channels . prior to 1996 october the filterbank consisted of 64 channels , each @xmath9 wide for a total bandwidth of @xmath10 . since 1996 october",
    "we have used an alternative back - end system consisting of 128 channels , each @xmath11 wide ( total bandwidth @xmath12 ) .",
    "the signal was detected , high and low - pass filtered , and sampled at @xmath13 .",
    "the observations were typically between 30 min and 100 min in duration .",
    "the off - line data analysis was performed in two stages .",
    "first , a dynamic spectrum was constructed by forming pulse profiles for each frequency channel over a small length of time , typically @xmath14 . in order to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio , we often summed consecutive frequency channels and time - intervals , making sure that we retained adequate resolution across individual scintillation maxima .",
    "subsequently , a 2-dimensional autocorrelation was formed of the summed dynamic spectrum , and 1-dimensional gaussians fitted to the zero lag in time and frequency to find the diffractive bandwidth , , and diffractive time scale , , respectively .",
    "no significant tilt of the autocorrelation function was observed , and we computed fractional uncertainties of the values based on the number of scintles present in the dynamic spectrum following cordes ( 1986 ) .",
    "the scintillation parameters for each observation and their associated errors are plotted as a function of days from periastron in figure  [ fig : scint ] .",
    "the main finding from these observations is that there is little or no change in the scintillation parameters with orbital phase from 25 days after periastron until 100 days before periastron .",
    "the apparent decrease in the scintillation bandwidth at .8 in late 1996 and early 1997 is most likely due to the improved spectral resolution .",
    "the standard deviation of the values throughout the orbit is @xmath030% , consistent with the individual uncertainties at both .8 and .4 . averaging all data at .8",
    ", we find that  = 8.5 @xmath15 and  = 190 @xmath16 . at .4",
    ", we find that  = 70 @xmath17 and  = 360 @xmath18 .",
    "the contrast of these values far from periastron with the @xmath020 hz scintillation bandwidth at .8 just prior to periastron is startling .",
    "scattering in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is due to electron density inhomogeneities which are thought to be distributed as a power - law , @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the 3-dimensional electron density power spectrum , @xmath21 gives the averaged level of turbulence along a particular line - of - sight , @xmath22 is the spatial wavenumber , and @xmath23 is the spectral index of the power spectrum ( e.g. kaspi & stinebring 1992 ) . in the discussion below",
    "we assume kolmogorov turbulence such that @xmath24 .    using the definition for @xmath21 given in cordes ( 1986 ) and the parameters for 259 , we find @xmath25 . this value places 259 in the top five pulsars ranked by @xmath21 and is more than two orders of magnitude greater than the ` canonical ' value of @xmath26 for the warm , ionized ( ism ) .",
    "further evidence for the enhanced density towards the pulsar comes from the pulsar s dm . at a distance of 1.5 kpc ,",
    "the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model yields an expected dm of @xmath27 , in contrast to the measured value of @xmath28 .",
    "the scintillation velocity , @xmath29 , can be computed from @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the observing frequency and @xmath32 is the ratio between the screen - observer distance and the screen - pulsar distance ( gupta et al .",
    "1994 ; gupta 1995 ) . assuming a mid - placed ( @xmath33 ) scattering screen we derive a scintillation velocity of @xmath0150 km s@xmath34 .",
    "we note that the scintillation velocity , as a function of orbital phase , is constant within the errors .",
    "the small and slowly changing component of the pulsar s orbital velocity can not be detected in the data .",
    "the proper motion of 259 has not been measured , although johnston et al .",
    "( 1994 ) estimate a recessional velocity of @xmath35 based on the shift of the h@xmath36 line .",
    "theoretical considerations of the evolution of systems like 259 give an upper limit of @xmath37 for the space velocity ( brandt & podsiadlowski 1995 ) . to reconcile this with",
    "the measured scintillation velocity implies @xmath38 , placing the screen closer to the pulsar than the observer .    evidently , then , there is good evidence for enhanced - density scattering material located significantly closer to the pulsar than mid - way from the observer . in the following discussion",
    "we derive an expression linking the scintillation bandwidth with the total electron density variance along the line - of - sight , @xmath39 , the outer scale of density inhomogeneities , @xmath40 , and the thickness of the scattering screen , @xmath41 .",
    "we then consider three possible locations of the scattering screen : the wind of the be star , a possible  sphere surrounding the system , and the sagittarius - carina spiral arm , all three of which satisfy the condition on @xmath32 .",
    "> from geometric ray optics , we can compute the time delay , @xmath42 , of scattered rays and using the ` uncertainty relationship ' , @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the speed of light and @xmath46 is the scattering angle at the screen .",
    "( note that for a mid - placed screen , @xmath33 , the angular broadening , @xmath47 , is @xmath48 and equation 2 becomes the familiar @xmath49 . ) by relating the electron density inhomogeneities to the coherence length of the electromagnetic phase , @xmath46 can be expressed as @xmath50^{-3/5}\\ ] ] ( cordes et al . 1985 ) , where @xmath51 is the classical electron radius .",
    "@xmath52 is given by @xmath53 both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are dimensionless constants which depend only on @xmath23 and have values of 2.49 and 0.18 , respectively , for @xmath24 ( cordes et al .",
    "1985 , cordes et al .",
    "1991 ) . combining these equations and putting the parameters in convenient astronomical units we find that @xmath56 ^{5/6}.\\ ] ]    the wind of the be star near apastron is a possible scattering site",
    "however , if this were the case , one would expect a modulation in the scintillation parameters as a function of orbital phase .",
    "our observations cover a period in which the distance of the pulsar from the be star varies by a factor of 3 ; assuming a wind profile density which varies as @xmath57 , this implies a change in electron density by a factor of @xmath010 .",
    "given that the scintillation bandwidth scales as @xmath58 ( from equation [ [ eq : ne2 ] ] ) , if @xmath59 and @xmath40 remain constant we should observe a change in  by a factor @xmath0250 .",
    "furthermore , the wind velocity is as high as @xmath01000 km s@xmath34 and this would then be the dominant velocity in the system , causing a diffractive timescale much shorter than observed .",
    "finally , it is unlikely that the electron density within the wind is large enough to cause the observed scintillation until very close to periastron . assuming the scattering screen is located only a few hundred light seconds from the pulsar and that @xmath60 is also of this order , then @xmath61 @xmath62 . for even a fully modulated wind with @xmath63 the implied electron densities",
    "are only encountered within @xmath6430 days of periastron .    the uv flux from hot",
    ", high - mass stars can form an  bubble ( or  sphere ) within the ism .",
    "the interface between these two regions can be a source of turbulence and is a possible site for scattering .",
    "we can put limits on the emission measure of the  sphere from a 12-hr synthesis image of the pulsar made using the australia telescope compact array .",
    "the observations were made at frequencies of 1.4 and 2.4 ghz and were gated into 8 bins synchronous with the pulsar period .",
    "after removal of the pulsed component from the image , the upper limit on the brightness temperature of any residual emission is @xmath01 k. using standard equations for free - free emission from  regions and assuming a temperature of 10@xmath65 k , the upper limit on the emission measure is 650 @xmath62pc .",
    "the radius of a  sphere for a b2 star with effective temperature of @xmath66 k is related to the electron density within the surrounding medium by @xmath67 ( prentice & ter haar 1969 ) .",
    "hence , we see that @xmath68 @xmath7 and @xmath69 pc for the  sphere to be undetectable .",
    "applying equation ( [ eq : ne2 ] ) , assuming @xmath70750 and @xmath71 pc , we see that @xmath72 must be larger than @xmath73 @xmath62 to yield the observed scintillation bandwidth . such a large value is inconsistent with the upper limit on the electron density imposed by the lack of radio emission .",
    "thus , the  sphere can not be the source of the observed scattering .",
    "the sagittarius - carina arm intersects the line - of - sight at a distance of @xmath01 kpc .",
    "the spiral arm likely contains numerous , high - density regions which can cause both excess dm and scattering . if we estimate @xmath74pc for an  region and use @xmath75 , equation ( [ eq : ne2 ] ) yields @xmath76 @xmath62pc . from the excess dm we have that @xmath77 @xmath7pc and assuming that the condition @xmath78 holds within the  region then we find @xmath79 @xmath7 and @xmath80 pc .",
    "the derived electron density is consistent with @xmath06 @xmath7 and @xmath03 @xmath7 obtained by heiles , reach , & koo ( 1996 ) and mckee & williams ( 1997 ) , respectively , for ` typical '  regions .",
    "we thus conclude that the source of the enhanced scattering is one ( or several )  regions within the sagittarius - carina spiral arm .",
    "a number of other factors point to the sagittarius - carina spiral arm as a dominant source of scattering .",
    "psr  j12436423 , only 2.2  distant from 259 on the sky , has very similar scintillation parameters to those of 259 ( johnston et al . 1997 ) .",
    "its dm - derived distance is @xmath81 , yet indications from  absorption suggest a distance as low as @xmath82 ( frail & weisberg 1990 ) .",
    "it seems evident that the spiral arm contributes both to its large dm and relatively small scintillation bandwidth .",
    "nicastro & johnston ( 1997 ) recently discovered a pulsar only 7  from 259 with an exceedingly high dm of @xmath83 .",
    "such a large dm is not expected in this part of the galactic plane , and this again points to the spiral arm as a significant source of excess electrons .    near periastron we conclude that the disk of the be star must dominate the scattering .",
    "twenty days from periastron  is @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "we assume that the proximity of the scattering screen implies @xmath86 .",
    "we take @xmath87 light seconds and hence obtain @xmath39 of @xmath88 @xmath62 .",
    "again , assuming @xmath89 , an electron density of @xmath90 @xmath7 is required .",
    "modeling of the disk of the be star ( melatos et al .",
    "1995 ) shows that the maximum density encountered along the line of sight through the disk reaches @xmath91 @xmath7 some 25 days prior to periastron and rises by an order of magnitude at periastron itself .",
    "hence , near to periastron , there is sufficient density in the be star s disk to produce the observed scattering .",
    "because the scattering angle is @xmath00.5 , the angular broadening produces an image size of @xmath92 cm on the screen .",
    "this value is significantly larger than the diffractive coherence scale of @xmath010@xmath93 cm for scattering in the spiral arm .",
    "we thus expect a quenching of the scintillation seen through the spiral arm , which is confirmed by the observations .",
    "we have determined the scintillation parameters of the binary pulsar 259 as a function of orbital phase and conclude that there is no change in these parameters except during a small portion of the orbit around the time of periastron .",
    "the scintillation bandwidth is much less than expected if the scintillation were solely due to the background ism .",
    "we have demonstrated that the electron densities are not sufficiently large in either the wind of the be star far from periastron or a putative  sphere to produce the observed scattering .",
    "the sagittarius - carina spiral arm is therefore the most likely origin of the scintillation far from periastron . at periastron",
    ", however , the electron density in the be star disk is sufficiently large to counterbalance the ` lever - arm effect ' of having the screen so close to the pulsar .",
    "this produces extremely strong scattering , and the resultant broadening of the pulsar image is sufficient to quench further scintillation in the ism .",
    "the back - end system used in this work was designed and built by a. lyne at the university of manchester .",
    "we thank r. manchester for help with the observations , b. rickett for fruitful discussions and h. fagg and m. mccoll for receiver installation and maintenance .",
