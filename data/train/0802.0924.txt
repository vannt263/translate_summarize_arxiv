    "hydrated acceptor - doped perovskites are known to be proton conductors in the temperature range @xmath4200700@xmath5c.@xcite the doping creates an oxygen - deficient structure and in a humid atmosphere water molecules dissociate into hydroxide ions , which fill the oxygen vacancies , and protons , which bond to lattice oxygens.@xcite the proton conductivity of perovskites varies quite dramatically amongst different types of materials for the same dopant concentration .",
    "for instance , in the bazr@xmath6@xmath1@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath1 = y , in , sc and ga ) system , the proton conductivity differs several orders of magnitude depending on the dopant atom used.@xcite the origin for this difference is intriguing and remains to be clarified .",
    "the current understanding of the conduction mechanism in hydrated perovskites is that the transport process occurs in two elementary steps : i ) hydrogen - bond mediated proton transfer between adjacent oxygens , and ii ) reorientational motion of the hydroxyl group in between such transfers . in this two - stage mechanism",
    "it is only the protons that exhibit long - range diffusion while the oxygens reside on their crystallographic positions .",
    "these processes have been studied in different systems mainly using molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and quasielastic neutron scattering ( qens)@xcite . qens is a particularly suitable experimental technique as it gives access to the time range @xmath410@xmath710@xmath8 s , in which these processes occur , as well as providing information about the spatial geometry of the atomic motions . in addition , the very high neutron scattering cross section of protons provides a good contrast in the experiments and enables studies of systems with a low dopant concentration , _",
    "i.e. _ a low hydration degree and concomitantly few protons .    previous qens investigations have revealed localized motions in the ps time range , mainly interpreted as rotational motions with radii between @xmath9@xmath40.7 and 1.1  , and with activation energies @xmath10@xmath11100 mev.@xcite the results have also been interpreted in more complex terms of a diffusional process of the proton consisting of a sequence of free diffusion and trapping / escape events.@xcite these studies have , however , been performed on orthorhombic perovskites , which makes the interpretation of the data more difficult as the structure is intrinsically anisotropic and there are several non - equivalent oxygen sites for the protons in the structure .",
    "in addition , no study has addressed the question of the role of the type of dopant on the elementary steps in the conduction mechanism .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations on proton conducting perovskites have revealed a fast rotational motion of the protons around the line connecting the cell edge of the perovskite structure on the ps time scale and with an activation energy less than 50 mev.@xcite by extending the simulations to higher temperatures and pressures , also five proton transfer events within a simulation time of @xmath4100 ps were observed.@xcite this process was found to be considerably dependent on the oxygen - oxygen separation , inferred by the vibrations of the oxygen sublattice.@xcite in the contracted transition state , having an energy of @xmath40.41 ev , proton transfer was found to occur almost barrierless , although it was not always that the proton was transferred.@xcite    in the present work we investigate the proton dynamics in 10% y- and sc - doped bazro@xmath12 , the two extremes in the cubic bazr@xmath6@xmath1@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath1 = y , in , sc and ga ) system considering the conductivity , using qens .",
    "the main interest in this study lies in the fact that although the structure of these materials is very similar , their proton conductivities differ almost two orders of magnitude with the y - doped perovskite exhibiting the highest.@xcite the qens results reveal a localized proton motion , with a slightly different activation energy in the two materials , and a comparison to density functional theory calculations suggests that for both materials we observe proton transfers between neighboring oxygens close to dopant atoms .",
    "the bazr@xmath6@xmath1@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath1 = y and sc ) samples , hereafter abbreviated as 10y : bzo and 10sc : bzo , respectively , were prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of baco@xmath12 , zro@xmath13 and ( y / sc)@xmath13o@xmath12 . the oxides were heated to 250@xmath14c overnight to remove moisture prior to weighing . to ensure thorough mixing ethanol ( 99.5 % )",
    "was added during the milling procedure , which was performed manually using an agate mortar and a pestle .",
    "the finely ground mixtures were fired at 1000@xmath14c for 8 hours and subsequently ground and pelletized using a 13 mm diameter die under a pressure of 8 tons .",
    "the pellets were sintered at 1200@xmath14c in air for 72 hours .",
    "after sintering , the pellets were reground , compacted , and refired at 1500@xmath14c for 48 h. finally , the pellets were finely reground to powders . the charging with protons",
    "was performed by annealing the powder samples at @xmath4300@xmath14c under a flow ( 12 ml / min ) of ar saturated with water vapor at 76@xmath14c for 10 days .",
    "our x - ray measurements revealed a cubic structure of both hydrated materials .",
    "one should note that 10y : bzo has previously been reported as tetragonal.@xcite however , from our diffractogram we find no evidence for a tetragonal distortion .",
    "the qens experiments were performed at the time - of flight spectrometer in6 at the institut laue langevin in grenoble ( france ) , using neutrons with a wavelength of 5.1  , yielding an energy resolution of 100 @xmath15ev ( fwhm ) and a @xmath16-range 0.261.9 @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath16-dependent spectra were summed into 14 groups to increase the statistics .",
    "spectra were measured at 2 , 250 , 300 , 380 , 430 , 465 and 495 k for 10y : bzo , and at 2 , 380 , 430 , 465 and 495 k for 10sc : bzo , and the integration time was four hours .",
    "the 2 k measurements were used as resolution functions in the data analysis .",
    "the samples were loaded in vacuum tight al - containers , which were coated on the inside with a 100 nm thick layer of pt to avoid corrosion .",

    "the sample containers were mounted in 135@xmath14 geometry in a cryofurnace .",
    "a spectrum of the empty sample container was measured at 380 k and subtracted as a background from the sample spectra while a vanadium standard was used to correct for the detector efficiency .",

    "only protons are expected to move on this time scale the quasielastic broadening can thus be directly related to proton motions , which facilitates the analysis .",

    "the temperature dependence of the total mean square displacement in fig .",
    "[ u2 t ] suggests an onset of this motion at a temperature of about 300 k , whereas below this  threshold  temperature , the total mean square displacement seems to be related only to harmonic ( vibrational ) motions of the protons .",
    "this finding agrees well with a recent inelastic neutron scattering study of hydrated bain@xmath55zr@xmath56o@xmath57 , where it was found that the total mean square displacement of the protons increased only very slightly between 30 and 300 k.@xcite    the observed local process has an activation energy of 10 mev ( 10y : bzo ) and 30 mev ( 10sc : bzo ) for the quasielastic width .",
    "these values are considerably lower than the activation energy for the proton conductivity , which is around 500 mev.@xcite thus , the process we observe in our experiment can not be rate limiting for the long - range proton diffusion .",
    "that is , there must exist another dynamical process of the protons , which occurs on a longer time scale and that can not be observed in the present experiments , that controls the rate of the long - range diffusivity , _",
    "i.e. _ the macroscopic proton conductivity . perhaps , this could be the escape event from a trapping site in the structure , where the proton spends an extended time before it diffuses further .",

    "as described above , we can imagine two localized dynamical processes for the proton in hydrated perovskites , i ) proton transfer between adjacent oxygens , and ii ) rotation of the o - h group around the line connecting the octahedrally coordinated cations .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations have shown that these processes are well described with a jump diffusion model over two ( transfer ) and four ( rotation ) sites , respectively.@xcite for these models the quasielastic intensities are given by @xcite @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the quasielastic structure factors for the transfer and rotational motion , respectively , @xmath9 is the jump length , and @xmath62 is a scale factor that we need to use since we do not have the quasielastic intensities on an absolute scale . included in fig .",
    "[ al ] are free fits with the two model functions to the quasielastic intensity for the investigated temperatures , while the fit parameters are shown in tab .",
    "[ fitparametersdecoupled ] . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ al ] , it is very difficult to discriminate between the two models . in order to directly separate them it would be necessary to have data at larger @xmath16-values . it should here be noted that some of us performed an experiment at the inverted time - of - flight quasielastic spectrometer iris at the pulsed neutron source isis in united kingdom to extend the @xmath16-range to 0.53.7  , but due to the presence of numerous bragg peaks in this @xmath16-range it was , unfortunately , impossible to analyze these spectra with sufficient accuracy .",
    "insight into what process we are observing may instead be obtained from the jump lengths , see tab .",
    "[ fitparametersdecoupled ] . from these",
    "we can see that for both the transfer and rotational model the jump lengths for the sc - doped material are overall shorter than for the y - doped counterpart .",
    "furthermore , we see that apart from the lowest temperature ( 380 k ) , the obtained jump lengths are basically temperature independent .",
    "the temperature independence for @xmath63495 k suggests that the fits are physically reasonable , while the overall larger values for the 380 k data is likely a consequence of the low quasielastic intensity at this temperature , wherefore these fit parameters have larger uncertainty .",
    "thus , we will keep the following discussion to @xmath64  k.    the proton experiences a different local surrounding and hence a different potential energy surface ( pes ) depending on where it is located in the structure.@xcite figure  [ picture ] shows the relevant migration paths for the proton around and between oxygens in the first ( o1 ) and second ( o2 ) oxygen coordination shell of a dopant atom @xmath1 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ picture ] , r1 and r2 denote the rotational processes at o1 and o2 , respectively , and t11 , t12 and t22 represent proton transfers between adjacent o1 atoms , between adjacent o1 and o2 atoms , and between adjacent o2 atoms , respectively .",
    "further away from the dopant atom the pes is less distorted and there is essentially only one type of rotational ( r ) and one type of transfer ( t ) process .",
    "these local motions have been modeled by dft calculations on a system corresponding to a dopant concentration of 3.7%.@xcite the jump lengths and classical migration barriers so obtained for the r1 , r2 , t11 , t12 , t22 , r and t processes in sc- and y - doped bazro@xmath12 , respectively , are reported in tab .",
    ".    .[fitparametersdecoupled ] jump lengths obtained from free fits of the quasielastic intensity with the jump - diffusion models over two and four sites according to eq .",
    "( [ structurefactor_transfer ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ structurefactor_rotation ] ) .",
    "@xmath65 denotes the jump length for the transfer process , and @xmath66 denotes the jump length ( radius ) for the rotational process . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the y - doped material the situation seems to be very similar although for this material the pes is not only lowered at o1 but also , to an equal extent , at o2.@xcite this suggests that the protons spend most of their time close to the y dopants , but , in contrast to sc : bzo , with a similar occupation of o1 and o2 sites .",
    "however , inspection of tab .",
    "[ dft ] shows that all the migration pathways r1 , @xmath67 , r2 near y , except t11 , are associated with relatively high classical energy barriers ( @xmath68  mev ) .",
    "hence , these processes are expected to occur on much longer time scales than the one / ones we observe in the experiments .",
    "the only remaining candidate is then t11 , which has a calculated classical barrier is of 90  mev ( _ cf . _",
    "[ dft ] ) .",
    "further addition of @xmath69  mev obviously results in a negative barrier , which is not physically sound .",
    "given the tendency of dft to underestimate this type of barrier it is , however , not unreasonable to link t11 to the measured 10  mev activation energy in the y - doped material .",
    "consequently , we once again claim that t11 gives the predominant contribution to the experimental spectra , despite an even larger ( 0.17   ) difference between the experimental and theoretical jump lengths . in this context",
    "we note that even though the degree of hydration is higher in the y - doped material,@xcite the slightly higher quasielastic intensity for the sc - doped material ( _ c.f .",
    "[ al ] ) suggests that there is a larger number of protons in the immediate vicinity of the dopant in the sc - doped material than in the y - doped counterpart .",
    "this is in agreement with the very high t12 barrier for the sc - doped material , which may also be the reason to the lower proton conductivity of this material .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the comparatively larger disagreement between our experimental results and the calculations in 10y : bzo may suggest that a more complex process is taking place , or that the processes listed in tab .",
    "[ dft ] contribute in an averaged manner to the quasielastic intensity . in order to elucidate what process / es we are seeing in the two materials , and in 10y : bzo in particular , further experimental and theoretical investigations are needed .",

    "the results reveal a localized proton motion on the ps time scale and with a low activation energy , @xmath41030 mev .",
    "comparison of the qens results to density functional theory calculations suggests that for both materials we observe proton transfers between neighboring oxygens bound to a dopant atom .",
    "the low activation energy , much lower than the activation energy for the macroscopic proton conductivity , suggests that this process is not rate - limiting for the long - range proton diffusion in either of the two materials .",
