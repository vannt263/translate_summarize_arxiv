    "radiative decays @xmath5 and @xmath6 are important processes to study the nature of the @xmath0 resonance because of the proximity of the @xmath7 system to the mass of the subthreshold @xmath0@xcite . from parity and angular momentum conservation ,",
    "it is clear in these decay processes that the s - channel exchange of the @xmath0 resonance must be predominant at threshold@xcite .",
    "therefore , information on the @xmath0 couplings can be obtained by analyzing these radiative decays .",
    "measurements of the branching ratio were recently renewed by the brookhaven experiment .",
    "they were reported to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these new measurements improved previous experimental values @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which might contain attributions either from in - flight @xmath12 or pile up to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 events with poor energy resolution@xcite . on the other hand , however , theoretical estimates on these processes within the framework of the isobar model remain untouched , with old predictions for the past experimental values@xcite .    in our previous work@xcite , we showed that inclusion of the t - channel exchange of the axial vector meson @xmath3 could improve the model prediction for these ratios , because the @xmath3 with spin parity @xmath15 was allowed by parity and angular momentum conservation at threshold , as well as @xmath0 . here , we investigate the reaction process @xmath16 by using the result of our previous work to constrain the process . to be more specific",
    ", we calculate cross sections for photoproduction @xmath2 with the coupling constants determined from the decay process of the @xmath7 system . due to the scarcity of experimental data ,",
    "however , this process has rarely been studied .",
    "therefore , the numerical consequences in this work will be predictions for future experiments .    in section",
    "i , we give a brief summary of the branching ratio @xmath17 studied in ref.@xcite with emphasis on the additional contribution of @xmath18 exchange , and we compare the result with those of refs.@xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we calculate the total and differential cross sections for @xmath16 .",
    "we discuss the results in the final section .",
    "the decay width for the process @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the 4-momenta of the kaon , proton , hyperon , and photon with masses @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , respectively . the @xmath28 is the wave function of the kaon captured at the s - orbit with respect to a proton , and @xmath29 is the invariant mass of the process .",
    "the width is evaluated at threshold @xmath30 in the center of mass frame with the spin - average for the initial state and the spin - sum for the final state interacting particles .",
    "then , the branching ratio is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the decay width of the @xmath7 system for all channels and @xmath33mev @xmath34 is the pseudopotential of the @xmath7 system@xcite .    with the transition amplitude @xmath35 in eq.([decay ] ) given in ref.@xcite , the t - channel @xmath3 exchange is obtained by replacing @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the photoproduction amplitude@xcite on the basis of crossing symmetry between the two processes .",
    "we have estimated the anomalous coupling constant @xmath38 by applying the vector meson dominance to the strong coupling vertex @xmath39@xcite .",
    "the strong coupling constants @xmath40 , and @xmath41 can be determined by using the su(3 ) octet relations@xcite .    in table",
    "[ cb ] , we list principal coupling constants for the non - resonant born terms and the @xmath42 and @xmath18 resonances couplings used for the calculation of branching ratios . on the basis of the same set of nucleon and hyperon resonances as those of ref.@xcite",
    ", the wf in table [ cb ] refers to the model calculation of ref.@xcite , type i to ref.@xcite , and type ii to the present work with the @xmath18 contribution to wf .",
    "[ cb ]    .[cb ] coupling constants for the non - resonant born terms and meson exchanges in the radiative decay processes @xmath43 and @xmath14 .",
    "anomalous magnetic moments are given in units of the proton magneton , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath49 and @xmath38 are in units of gev@xmath50 .",
    "nucleon and hyperon resonances are taken into account from ref.@xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values of the wjc model are taken from ref.@xcite . in this model ,",
    "meson exchanges in the t - channel are not considered by the duality between s- and t - channel .",
    "thus , not only the @xmath42 but the @xmath18 exchange is absent from the model . note that the wf values in table [ cc ] for the @xmath42 and the @xmath18 coupling constants are irrelevant here because they are , now , coupling to the @xmath0 .",
    "we must address that , while there is ambiguity in the sign of @xmath51 , we choose the sign of the @xmath52 to be opposite to the wjc one , as in table [ cc ] , in consideration of the relative signs between @xmath51 and @xmath52 in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also take the sign of the coupling constant @xmath53 of wjc to be opposite to the original one in ref.@xcite in order for the cross section to decrease beyond the resonance region , @xmath54 gev . with the cutoff @xmath55 for the hadron form factors taken as 1.2 gev for the non - resonant born terms and 1.8 gev for the resonances@xcite ,",
    "the numerical results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pstcrs-1 ] for the total cross section and in fig .",
    "[ fig : psdcrs-1.6 ] for the differential cross section , respectively .",
    "in fig . [ fig : pstcrs-1 ] , dashed and dash - dotted curves are the cross sections of the model with wjc coupling contants taken , each of which results from varying @xmath51 from 1.5 to 3.0 , respectively .",
    "the result of the present work is shown in the dash - dot - dotted , dotted , and solid lines corresponding to the choice of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 in order .",
    "it should be noted that all the curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : pstcrs-1 ] and [ fig : psdcrs-1.6 ] are calculated with the use of the same form factors in both models , i.e. , the model with wjc values and the present work for comparison , although the former in ref.@xcite does not consider such form factors . in the absence of these form factors , however , the maximum height of the wjc cross section becomes by an order of magnitude larger than the present one .",
    "as shown in this figure , the cross section is very sensitive to changes in the leading coupling constant @xmath51 .    figure .",
    "[ fig : psdcrs-1.6 ] shows the angular distributions in both model calculations near threshold , @xmath59 gev .",
    "the solid curve results from the present work , and the dotted one from the model with wjc values , where @xmath60 is taken in common for comparison .",
    "the angular distribution of the former represents an apparent feature of p - wave production , indicating a rapid increase of the t - channel kaon exchange@xcite , while the latter demonstrates the backward increase implementing the strong u - channel contribution , which in the present study might be due to the hyperon exchanges considered . in fact , such a distinction can be thought of as a natural consequence of the different choice of coupling - channels ; i.e. , the absence of t - channel couplings from the model with wjc values leads to the u - channel enhancement .    in this work ,",
    "we have presented an analysis of the branching ratio of @xmath61 and have applied the obtained coupling constants to an analysis of the @xmath2 process in the framework of the isobar model . introducing the axial vector meson @xmath3 from parity and angular momentum conservation , we have improved the model prediction for the branching ratio .",
    "related to this issue , we make a comment on the unitary coupled channel approach to these processes , in which the role of the initial state interaction in the @xmath62 process is emphasized@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the resonance state @xmath0 is generated in a noble way such as the quasi - bound state of a @xmath63 or a @xmath64 coupled channel@xcite .",
    "we note in ref.@xcite , however , that such an approach to the radiative decay of the @xmath7 system yields an overestimate of the branching ratio , which amounts to double the value of the measured one for the @xmath13 decay ; i.e. , @xmath65 ( without cut - off @xmath66 ) .",
    "thus , it needs further corrections , apart from the model dependence due to the cutoff @xmath66 .",
    "we have investigated the photoproduction @xmath67 with relevant coupling constants constrained from the radiative decay of the @xmath7 system .",
    "cross sections are reproduced for our further understanding of the strong and the electromagnetic properties of the @xmath0 through the production mechanism .",
    "we found in this work that the magnitude of the cross section for the @xmath4 photoproduction was of an order of micro barn , which was very sensitive to variations in the leading coupling constant @xmath68 . without resonances with masses around 2 gev near threshold",
    ", large sensitivity of the cross section to the change of @xmath51 could be a useful tool for determining the coupling constant by measuring cross sections in future experiments",
    ". as discussed , the difference between the angular distributions reproduced in both models is contrasting .",
    "they reveal the respective features of the t - channel and the u - channel contributions , which are to be distinguished , as well , from future experiments .",
