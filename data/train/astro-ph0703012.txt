    "clusters are natural laboratories to study the effects of environment on the evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "a plethora of evidence shows that the properties of late - type galaxies depend strongly on environment : besides the well known morphology - density relation @xcite , in local clusters ( @xmath40.03 ) spiral galaxies are deficient in neutral hydrogen @xcite and have lower star formation activity than galaxies of similar type and size in low density environments @xcite .",
    "various physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the different evolution of late type spirals in clusters and in the field . in general , they invoke either dynamical interactions of cluster galaxies with the hot intracluster medium ( icm , @xcite ) , or gravitational interactions with nearby companions @xcite , with the potential of the cluster @xcite , or with a combination of these two @xcite . interactions with the icm are likely to be the dominant process at the present epoch and can account for the truncation of the gas disks in members of several local clusters ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , ram - pressure can not produce the strong morphology - density relation @xcite , nor can it thicken the disk of a spiral galaxy and transform it into an s0 ( i.e. @xcite ) . +",
    "this apparent contradiction could be solved if the structures form hierarchically ; that is , if galaxy clusters form not by accreting individual galaxies randomly from the field , but rather by the infall of less massive groups along filaments .",
    "these infalling groups have velocity dispersions that are much smaller than that of the cluster as a whole , permitting the slow , strong interactions normally associated with field galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore a plausible evolutionary history would take into account that environmental conditions and the physical properties of galaxies are changed significantly during cosmic time , changing the influence of various physical mechanisms on the evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , this hypothesis is far from confirmed , since we lack detailed understanding of the range of environmental effects that act as a function of the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "although star - forming galaxies in clusters at intermediate redshift appear more disturbed @xcite and have higher star formation activity @xcite than local disk galaxies , it is still an open question which mechanisms are at play and how they influence the evolutionary history of cluster galaxies @xcite . to solve this riddle , we need to observe galaxies that physical circumstances and chance have revealed in rare moments of transformation .",
    "these peculiar systems can be used to probe different environmental effects and to constrain models of the evolutionary history of galaxies .",
    "much of our knowledge on the evolution of nearby galaxies in both groups @xcite and clusters @xcite has in fact come from studying of such systems .",
    "unfortunately this information is difficult to extend to high redshift because both clusters and galaxies have evolved significantly : clusters were less relaxed @xcite and galaxies had higher gas content .",
    "therefore , the effects of the same environmental mechanisms could depend strongly on the age of the universe .",
    "+ in this paper , we present a multiwavelength analysis of two peculiar galaxies ( hereafter referred as 235144 - 260358 and 131124 - 012040 ) falling into the centers of the massive clusters abell 2667 ( @xmath50.23 ) and abell 1689 ( @xmath50.18 ) .",
    "both these systems are associated with extended trails of bright blue knots and diffuse wisps and filaments of young stars , features observed so far only in one other galaxy at similar redshift @xcite .",
    "these two objects have been serendipitously detected by looking at the wfpc2 and acs images of massive clusters at z@xmath00.2 .",

    "we therefore found 2 galaxies with extended trails within 13 studied clusters all located at 0.175@xmath60.25 , suggesting that we are observing a very short snapshot of a critical stage in the evolution of these cluster galaxies .",
    "+ because these two systems have significantly different optical luminosities ( @xmath7 and @xmath00.1@xmath8 ) but are at similar distances from the cores of clusters of similar mass , they represent an interesting case for a comparison of the effects of similar environments on different - sized galaxies . + throughout this paper we assume a cosmology with @xmath9 = 0.3 , @xmath10 = 0.7 and @xmath11 = 70 km / s mpc@xmath12 , implying a distance modulus of 39.74 ( 40.33 ) mag and a linear scale of 3.16 ( 3.71 ) kpc / arcsec for a1689 ( a2667 ) .",

    "this very simple scenario , supported by the fact that infalling galaxies have usually highly eccentric radial orbits @xcite , allow us to express the cluster - centric distance ( r ) as a function of the galaxy infalling velocity : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the ( measured ) velocity component along the line of sight and @xmath90 is the cluster - centric distance projected along the line of sight .",

    "+ both clusters have a 1d velocity dispersion @xmath95 @xcite , implying a 3d infalling velocity @xmath96 . in the following we therefore assume a 3d infalling velocity in the range between 1000@xmath971730 @xmath98 ( i.e. @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) that can be considered as upper and lower limit of the real value .",
    "the values so derived for the cluster - centric distance , the length and the age of the trails for the upper and lower limit of @xmath101 are summarized in table [ model_assumption ] .",
    "although the tidal interaction hypothesis is consistent with the presence of a strong starburst only in 235144 - 260358 , it is not able to explain why 131124 - 012040 shows clear signs of a recent truncation of its star formation .",
    "both a1689 and a2667 are x - ray bright clusters suggesting that the effects of the hot intracluster medium could be significant .",

    "while at its current location 131124 - 012040 has almost been totally stripped by ram pressure ( @xmath143 ) , in 235144 - 260358 ram pressure has only affected the outer galaxy regions ( @xmath144 ) .",

    "[ rstrip ] right ) .",
    "131124 - 012040 has already lost @xmath14580 % of its original gas content and if observed in a local cluster it would be classified as a highly hi - deficient object .",
    "conversely , ram pressure has only stripped a tiny fraction of the gas from 235144 - 260358 , whose hi deficiency ( @xmath00.25 ) would approximately lie at the edge between normal and deficient galaxies ( hi - deficiency@xmath0 0.2 ) .",
    "we remark that the hi - deficiency shown in fig.[rstrip ] is not determined from observations , but is obtained from our analytical model .",
    "+ comparing fig.[rstrip ] to fig.[accrad ] it appears clear that ram pressure in 131124 - 012040 has become efficient before gravitational interactions were able to strip material from the galaxy .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the different time - scales of the interaction determined from the inversion of the color gradients ( @xmath66 300 myr , likely produced by ram pressure stripping ) and from the blue star - forming trails ( @xmath86 100 myr , clear signature of gravitational interactions ) .",
    "the mutual effects of gravitational interactions and ram pressure have already been observed in several cluster galaxies , however the tails of blue star forming knots here discovered represent an extremely rare feature , to our knowledge previously observed only one other starburst galaxy in the abell cluster 2125 ( @xmath50.247 , @xcite ) .",
    "the morphology and luminosity of the knots suggest that we are dealing with dwarf galaxies and/or stellar super - clusters @xcite .",
    "this could explain the observed difference between luminosity of the knots ( @xmath02.5 mag ) in the two galaxies since the luminosity of the brightest star clusters is usually correlated with the sfr of the parent galaxy @xcite .",
    "+ the properties of the knots ( i.e. colors and emission lines ) suggest that they are undergoing an extended period of star formation as discussed in section 3 . from the model described in the previous sections the dynamical age of the trails results 50@xmath146 myr and 20@xmath147 myr for 235144 - 260358 and 131124 - 012040 respectively ,",
    "fairly consistent obtained in the previous section must be considered as a lower limit since it assumes that the stripped material is at rest with regard to the cluster . ] with the age inferred from their optical colors ( see fig .",
    "[ ccdiagram ] ) .",
    "it is impossible to determine whether the knots where already forming stars when they have been stripped or if their activity was triggered by an external mechanism once in the icm .",
    "we can exclude that these systems have been formed in the icm by the accretion of unbounded material stripped by the parent galaxies : the combined effects of the cluster tidal field and ram pressure tend to inhibit the formation of bound systems from the collapse of stripped material @xcite .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite showed that gravitational interactions can lead to the formation and ejection of peripheral self gravitationally bound clouds with masses @xmath148 , which begin their life in a major burst of star formation .",
    "moreover @xcite have recently demonstrated that ram pressure can trigger the collapse of stripped clouds leading to a burst of star formation , suggesting that even the formation and evolution of the blue star forming knots is probably driven by the mutual effects of gravitational interactions and ram pressure .",
    "only deeper spectroscopic observations will shed light on the star formation history of these rare objects .",
    "the analysis in this paper allows us to propose a scenario for the evolution of the two disturbed galaxies in abell 2667 and abell 1689 .",
    "these objects are currently falling into massive , gas - rich galaxy clusters with similar mass and gas density profiles ( see table [ cluster ] ) . under the combined action of tidal forces",
    "( more likely from the cluster potential ) and of ram pressure by the icm , their morphologies and star formation are strongly perturbed .",
    "self gravitational bound systems are ejected from the main galaxies and stars and ionized gas are stripped from the stellar disks producing the observed tails of blue knots and stellar wisps tracing the infalling trajectory of these systems into the cluster core .",
    "only the tidal field of abell 2667 is able to drive a gas infall into the center of 235144 - 260358 triggering a nuclear burst of star formation and making this galaxy a rare example of luminous infrared cluster galaxy .",
    "simultaneously ram pressure stripping by the hot intracluster medium strips the neutral hydrogen from the galaxy outskirts but it is not able to affect the central regions where the starburst is taking place .",
    "conversely in 131124 - 012040 gravitational forces are not strong enough to trigger the collapse of gas clouds while ram pressure is already extremely efficient . at the present galaxy location ram pressure",
    "has stripped at least the @xmath080% of the original neutral hydrogen content , quenching the star formation activity in this object , as confirmed by the strong balmer line in absorption observed in the optical spectrum @xcite and by the inversion of the optical color gradients along all the galaxy extent @xcite . +",
    "a larger statistical sample is necessary to determine whether we are witnessing a common snapshot in the evolution of cluster galaxies or an extremely rare phenomenon .",
    "in fact , as discussed in the introduction , only these 2 galaxies out of 13 different clusters imaged at 0.175@xmath60.25 show extended trails of blue knots . within the wfpc2 field of view ( @xmath00.25 @xmath149 at @xmath150 )",
    "there are typically @xmath050 cluster members but only the @xmath020% of them are spiral galaxies @xcite , implying a frequency of @xmath01.5% ( 2 over 130 ) among cluster spirals at @xmath50.2 .",
    "this value is fairly consistent with the expected frequency roughly obtained dividing the typical time scale of the interaction ( @xmath151200 myr ) to the age of the cluster ( @xmath011 gyr ) .",
    "+ if we are witnessing a common step of cluster galaxy evolution what can we learn by studying these two rare objects ?",
    "abell 2667 and abell 1689 have comparable mass and gas profiles and the two galaxies are approximately at the same projected cluster - centric distance , suggesting that the absolute intensity of the cluster tidal field and of ram pressure by the cluster icm is approximately the same in the two environments .",
    "therefore we can speculate that the different recent evolutionary history of the infalling systems could be in part related to their different properties ( i.e. their different luminosities : @xmath7 and @xmath00.1l@xmath39 ) . in this case",
    ", our result suggests that giant spiral galaxies infalling into the core of massive clusters are mainly perturbed by the gravitational interaction with the cluster .",
    "stars respond by forming arms and bars , while the gas flows directly toward the central region within @xmath152100 myr .",
    "the sinking of the gas towards the center triggers a burst of star formation and is able to alter the galaxy morphology ( @xcite ) .",
    "ram pressure stripping produces a truncation of the disk but only in the outskirts of the galaxy being not efficient within the optical effective radius .",
    "when all the remaining fuel has been consumed by the star formation this galaxy will not longer appear as a disky gas rich systems but more likely as a bulge dominated quiescent spiral .",
    "this is not the case for less massive galaxies .",
    "ram pressure is much more efficient on low mass systems and it is able to strip a considerable fraction of the neutral hydrogen from the inner part of these galaxies , preventing the gas from sinking toward the center driven by tidal interaction and quenching the star formation history . within @xmath01",
    "gyr this object will not appear as a blue spiral any more but will probably look like an early type ( e.g. red ) disky spiral @xcite .",
    "the different evolutionary scenarios for the evolution of low and high mass infalling galaxies emerging from our analysis apparently fit with recent observations and models , suggesting that the bulk of the cluster population of giant bulge dominated early type spiral galaxies can only be formed during some kind of gravitational interaction @xcite , while lower mass systems can be transformed by simple gas removal from healthy spirals @xcite .",
    "+ the properties of the blue knots stripped from the infalling galaxies deserve particular attention .",
    "these systems have a luminosity ( -16.5@xmath153 - 11.5 ) and a physical size ( @xmath154 kpc ) typical of dwarf galaxies and consistent with the ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( ucd , @xcite ) , recently discovered in abell 1689 @xcite .",
    "there are two competing formation scenarios to explain the origin of ucds .",
    "@xcite propose that they are the remnants of stripped dwarf galaxies . in this scenario",
    "a nucleated dwarf looses its envelope and a great part of its dark matter content due to tidal interaction with another object . on the contrary @xcite",
    "propose that ucda could origin from the _ amalgamation _ of rich aggregates of young massive star clusters that can form during gravitational interactions between gas - rich galaxies .",
    "it appears clear that the knots discovered here strongly support the second scenario , suggesting that at least part of the population of ultra - compact dwarfs originate from young massive star clusters : we are probably for the first time witnessing the dawn of the ucds .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with the recent discovery of a massive extra galactic star cluster ( @xmath155 , @xmath156 myr ) lying at a projected distance of 17 kpc from the merger remnant ngc3310 and likely formed during the merging event @xcite .",
    "+ finally the diffuse stellar streams and ionized gas observed along the trails suggest that the mechanisms acting here will significantly influence the properties of the intracluster light and contribute to the enrichment of the icm .",
    "the results here obtained might be representative only of the clusters at @xmath1570.2 where the infalling rate is higher and galaxies have an higher gas content than the one observed in local clusters of galaxies .",
