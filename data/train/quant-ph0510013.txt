    "experimental verification on the conflict between quantum mechanics and local realism for two particles have been well demonstrated in several experiments @xcite . for a system with more than two particles , for example three particles , experimental verification of the violation of local realism",
    "is generally more difficult .",
    "recently , conflicts between quantum mechanics and local realism for three qubits and four qubits have also been verified @xcite . for n qubits , experimental observations for violation of",
    "bell inequalities are still lacking .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors proposed an optical setup for testing quantum nonlocality in phase space for two qubits .",
    "the setup essentially demonstrate quantum nonlocality based on phase space measurement of the wigner function using photon counting .",
    "the source used in ref .",
    "@xcite is a single photon incident on a 50:50 beam splitter ( see figure [ sourcefig ] ) .",
    "the generated state is @xmath0 written in terms of the exit ports @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "for example , @xmath3 means one photon exits at port @xmath1 and no photon exits at port @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath4 can be realized by one phase shifter to adjust the relative phase and the relative phase can be set to zero without loss of generality . as pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the measuring apparatus consists of a beam splitter and photon counting detector . the power transmission of the beam splitter is t. the incidence of an excited coherent state @xmath5 on the second input port of the beam splitter results in coherent displacement .",
    "namely , the action of the beam splitter is described by @xmath6 in the limit of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the realistic measurement proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is a test that the detectors are capable of resolving the number of absorbed photons and @xmath9 are assigned correspondingly to events in which an even / odd number of photons is registered . in short , the correlation function measured is the wigner function . in the experiment , quantum nonlocality of two qubits is revealed through violation of the chsh inequality @xcite . in this paper , we generalize the method to a @xmath10-particle system .    for @xmath10 qubits ,",
    "there have been umpteen bell inequalities that have been proposed @xcite to test quantum nonlocality .",
    "the more general inequalities are the ones given in @xcite .",
    "these inequalities ( b inequalities ) impose sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of local and realistic model .",
    "the b inequalities take the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is correlation function measured in a dichotomic - observable experiment .",
    "specific choices give nontrivial inequalities .",
    "for example , for @xmath13)$ ] one recovers the mabk inequalities @xcite . in the article",
    ", we propose a general experimental setup for testing quantum nonlocality of @xmath10 qubits by using the b inequalities . in section",
    "[ 1 ] , we generalize the two - qubit experimental scheme to @xmath10 qubits .",
    "we provide the general form of the correlation functions measured in the scheme . in section [ 2 ] , we consider the cases for @xmath14 as examples to show that the experimental observation of quantum nonlocality can be linked to the violation of 3-qubit and 4-qubit bell inequalities . for three qubits ,",
    "the b inequality is not violated by all pure entangled states @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we constructed bell inequalities which are violated by any pure entangled state of three qubits . both 3-qubit b inequality and",
    "the bell inequalities given in refs .",
    "@xcite will be used to test nonlocality in the proposed experiment .",
    "effect of detector inefficiency is also considered in the section .",
    "we first consider the source for generating an entangled state of @xmath10 qubits for the optical setup . for two qubits ,",
    "the source is a 50:50 beam splitter .",
    "the output state of the source is @xmath15 . for three qubits ,",
    "we look for a source that consists of a beam splitter with reflectivity @xmath16 followed by a 50:50 beam splitter .",
    "the output state is @xmath17 .",
    "such a source is shown in figure [ sourcefig ] ( 2 ) . in the figure [ sourcefig ] ( 2 ) , we use a black box to represent an effective three - qubit source . for a four - qubit source",
    ", one can build on the three - qubit source with an additional beam splitter .",
    "the beam splitter in this case has a reflectivity @xmath18 .",
    "generalizing , an @xmath10-qubit source for arbitrary @xmath10 qubit is realized by a beam splitter with reflectivity @xmath19 followed by a @xmath20-qubit source .",
    "the overall action of @xmath20-qubit source is that a single photon entering the box will have equal chances of exiting at any of the @xmath20 ports .",
    "the probability is @xmath21 .",
    "the beam splitter has a transmittance @xmath22 .",
    "so in figure [ sourcefig ] ( 3 ) , the probability of a single photon exiting from each port ( @xmath23 ) of the box is @xmath24 .",
    "the probability of a single photon exiting from the reflected port @xmath1 of the beam splitter is also @xmath25 since its reflectivity @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the effective source generates an @xmath10-qubit w state @xmath26 .",
    "the experimental setup is schematically shown in figure [ setupfig ] . a single photon enters the source and exits with an equal chance at each outgoing mode @xmath27 .",
    "the measuring devices are photon detectors preceded by beam splitters which have transmittance @xmath28 .",
    "strong coherent states @xmath29 are injected into the beam splitters . as a result ,",
    "the beam splitters give coherent displacements @xmath30 with @xmath31 on the input modes when @xmath32 @xcite . by assigning @xmath9 to the events that an even / odd number of photons has been registered ,",
    "the correlation function measured in the experiment is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is coherent displacement for the mode @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath35 is an operator defined as @xcite @xmath36 the operator @xmath35 is also of the form @xcite @xmath37 which is the displaced parity operator .",
    "because that @xmath38 for the state @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 for @xmath10 qubits , by measuring correlation functions and using b inequalities , one can hopefully show violation of @xmath10-qubit bell inequality . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate quantum nonlocality of 3 and 4 qubits .",
    "in this section , we generalize the scheme to 3 qubits first . for three qubits ,",
    "the source of nonclassical radiation is a single photon incident on a beam splitter with transmittance @xmath41 and reflectivity @xmath42 followed by a 50:50 beam splitter , which generates a three - qubit w state .",
    "the measuring devices are photon counters with beam splitters placed in front of them .",
    "the beam splitters have the transmission coefficient close to one with strong coherent beams injected into the auxiliary ports . in this limit , the beam splitters effectively perform coherent displacements @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 on the three ports ( modes ) of the input field .",
    "the correlation function measured is @xmath46 we next construct a bell quantity from the 3-qubit b inequality : @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the two experimental settings of the coherent displacements for ports @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively . for a local realistic theory , @xmath53 .",
    "unfortunately 3-qubit b inequality does not reveal quantum nonlocality since a numerical calculation gives @xmath54 .",
    "a possible reason is that the degree of quantum nonlocality depends not only on the given entangled state but also on the bell operator @xcite .",
    "hence the result means that 3-qubit b inequality may not reveal quantum nonlocality for displacement measurements on the particles .",
    "recently new bell inequalities for three qubits have been proposed in refs .",
    "the bell inequalities are violated for any pure entangled state .",
    "we next show that quantum nonlocality of three qubits can be exhibited in the proposed experimental scheme using the correlation - form inequality given in @xcite .    unlike the 3-qubit b inequality where there are only three - particle correlation functions , the recent bell inequality for three qubits contains two - particle correlation functions and one - particle correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the two - particle correlation functions and one - particle correlation functions are given by @xmath55 the two - particle correlation functions are measured when one of three observers does not perform any measurement on his detector .",
    "the one - particle correlation functions are measured when two of three observers do not perform any measurement on their detectors . by similar calculations to the one for three - particle correlation function , we have @xmath56 where @xmath57 . using a correlation form of the inequalities for three qubits given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we construct a new bell quantity for three qubits @xmath58 local realism theories impose the upper bound value of 3 for the bell quantity @xmath59 . by taking the coherent displacements as @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 which is greater than 3 .",
    "thus one can detect quantum nonlocality of a three - qubit system in the proposed experiment .          where @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath66 are two experimental settings of the coherent displacements for mode @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "by setting the experimental values of the coherent displacement as @xmath69 , @xmath70 , the maximum value of @xmath71 is calculated numerically to be 5.14529 .",
    "since local realistic theories require @xmath72 , the violation of local realism is simply shown from b inequality .",
    "it should be mentioned that other factors should be taken into account , such as detector inefficiencies , in practice .",
    "if one considers the inefficiency of detector , one has to modify the correlation slightly to account for the imperfections , which are characterized by the quantum efficiency of detectors @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) . for ideal detectors , @xmath75 and",
    "the correlation is perfect . for non - ideal detectors",
    ", the correlation is modified by @xmath76 .",
    "if we assume that all the photon detectors have the same efficiencies @xmath73 , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is an operator defined as @xmath79 a straightforward calculation yields the modified correlation function for the state @xmath80 @xmath81 the detector efficiency directly affects the experimental results . as an example , we consider the 3-qubit experiment . using the modified correlation functions @xmath82 where @xmath57 , a bell quantity @xmath83 is constructed from the bell inequality given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath84 since , for a local realistic description , @xmath85 and for quantum nonlocality , the bell quantity @xmath83 has a maximum value of 3.1605 , which is greater than 3 when @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the nonlocality of a three - qubit system exhibits in the proposed experiment if @xmath87 .",
    "quantum nonlocality of n qubits ( n is an arbitrary number ) can be tested in the proposed experiment in a similar way .    in the article",
    ", we propose an experimental setup for testing quantum nonlocality of @xmath10 qubits by using @xmath10-qubit bell inequalities .",
    "the correlation function measured in the scheme is described by the wigner function .",
    "we also briefly consider the case in which the detectors are inefficient and provide a threshold value above which nonlocality observation can be obtained .",
