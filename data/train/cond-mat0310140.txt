    "the quantum mechanical two - state system ( spin 1/2 or in today s modern language qubit ) interacting with a bosonic bath , is the simplest possible model to describe the effect of an environment on constructive and destructive quantum interference .",
    "it allows in a rather comprehensive way to investigate decoherence and damping on the quantum system imposed by a phenomenological environment .",
    "hence , it has found numerous applications ranging from electron transfer to quantum information processing .",
    "the characteristics of the harmonic bath in contact with the two - state system is captured by the spectral density @xmath1 of the bath .",
    "a well studied special case is the spin - boson model with an ohmic spectral density , where @xmath2 ( up to some cut - off frequency ) .",
    "this implies that the quantum system is damped equally at all frequencies , which is the case for many physical systems .",
    "a prominent example in the field of condensed matter physics are single - charge effects in micro- and nanostructured systems in which the electromagnetic environment can be modeled by an impedance of pure ohmic form .",
    "the more general case of @xmath1 having a power - law distribution , i.e. , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 sub - ohmic and @xmath5 super - ohmic bath ) also finds wide - spread applications , for instance when the tss couples to an electromagnetic environment represented by a rc - transmission line . for these specifications ,",

    "another limit to be mentioned in this context is the case of a single environmental mode at a specific frequency @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath6 , which is for instance realized by an electromagnetic environment with a pure inductive impedance .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the spin - boson model for the case of the bath spectral density having a distinct resonance at a characteristic frequency @xmath0 of the order of the tss level splitting , and behaving ohmically a low frequencies ( peaked spectral density with ohmic background ) .",
    "this model currently receives growing interest in the context of quantum computing with condensed matter systems @xcite , especially for superconducting flux qubit devices @xcite . in these devices , the state of the tss , i.e.",
    ", the direction of the magnetic flux , is read out by a dc - squid which couples inductively to the qubit superconducting loop . at bias currents well below the critical current @xmath7",
    ", the squid can be modeled as an inductor @xmath8 .",
    "an additional shunt capacitance @xmath9 creates an on - chip environment which improves the resolution of the dc - squid .",
    "the resulting impedance of this dc - squid environment can display a pronounced resonance at the characteristic frequency of the @xmath10-circuit ( see below for details ) .",
    "+ as an alternative but equivalent point of view , a tss coupled to a harmonic bath with a peaked spectral density represents an effective description of a tss coupled to a damped harmonic oscillator of characteristic frequency @xmath0 .",
    "in this perspective , this model has recently been used to describe solid state implementations of a qubit coupled to a resonator .",
    "various schemes of measurement , entanglement generation , quantum information transfer and interaction with a nonclassical state of the electromagnetic field have been proposed @xcite and dephasing effects have been addressed @xcite .",
    "moreover these devices , besides being promising candidates for realizing qubits in a possibly scalable quantum computer , are also very interesting objects to display fundamental quantum physical properties , like macroscopic quantum coherence @xcite , rabi oscillations @xcite , ramsey interference @xcite , etc .    the spin - boson model with a peaked spectral density of the bath has been investigated theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been demonstrated that an external driving field can be applied to slow down decoherence by moving the tss out of resonance with the ho due to dressing of the tss by the driving field .",

    "ohmic _ spectral density . throughout this work ,",
    "we concentrate on the case of a weak coupling of the oscillator to the ohmic bath , but the tss - ho coupling is kept arbitrary .",
    "this choice of the parameter region is due to the experimentally given situation of dc - squids which are typically underdamped .",
    "this mapping allows to apply the numerically exact method of the quasi - adiabatic propagator path - integral ( quapi ) @xcite for the tss+ho being the the central quantum system .",
    "ay additionally tracing out the ho degrees of freedom , we determine the time - evolution of the reduced density matrix of the tss .",
    "we extract the dephasing and relaxation time constants for the decay of a localized state of the tss . in order to elaborate the difference",
    ", we compare our numerical results to the well - known analytical expressions for the rates of a tss coupled to a structured harmonic reservoir evaluated to lowest order in the tss - reservoir coupling @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , these weak - coupling rates _ deviate considerably _ ( up to a factor of 50 ) from the numerically exact decay rates for level splittings around the oscillator frequency .",
    "this shows that if the frequencies of the tss and the ho are comparable , the decay rates are determined by the _ full _ frequency spectrum of the peaked environment , and not only by its low frequency weak ohmic backround .",
    "next , we concentrate on the specific case of the tss being exactly in resonance with the oscillator and establish a simple three - level description of the tss - ho system .",
    "since we are interested in weak system - bath coupling , we formulate the redfield equations for this three - level system ( 3ls ) which can be solved analytically .",
    "the resulting dephasing rates agree well with the numerically exact values of quapi .",
    "finally , we apply our general model to experimentally realized superconducting flux qubit devices .",
    "to setup the model , we consider the hamiltonian of a two - state system being coupled to a bath of ( non - interacting ) harmonic oscillators , i.e. , @xmath11 here , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the annihilation and creation operators of the @xmath14th bath mode with frequency @xmath15 .",

    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xmath21 here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the annihilation and creation operators of the localized ho mode while the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 are the corresponding bath mode operators .",
    "the spectral density of the continuous bath modes now becomes ohmic , i.e. , @xmath26 where we have introduced the usual high - frequency cut - off at @xmath27 ( we note that throughout this work , we use the value @xmath28 ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath29 follows as @xmath30 since for our cases of interest , the damping of the ho is small ( @xmath31 ) , we will denote the tss+ho - system as the central quantum system which is itself weakly damped .",
    "however , the coupling between the tss and the ho can still become large . in the following",
    ", we will evaluate the reduced density operator @xmath32 for the tss+ho - system , where the bath degrees of freedom have been traced out .",
    "@xmath33 denotes the full density operator at initial time @xmath34 . throughout this work",
    ", we assume a factorizing initial preparation where all three parts of the total system are decoupled and the coupling is switched on instantaneously at @xmath35 . in particular , we choose the bath being at thermal equilibrium at inverse temperature @xmath36 as well as the localized mode being thermally distributed .",

    "the measured value for the dephasing time is @xmath253 ns .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the dynamics of the spin - boson problem for the case when the frequency distribution of the bath shows a distinct resonance at a characteristic frequency @xmath0 .",
    "we have mapped this model onto that of a two - state - system ( tss ) coupled to a single harmonic oscillator ( ho ) mode with frequency @xmath0 , the latter being weakly coupled to an ohmic bath .",
    "since an ohmic bath induces rather fast decaying correlations at finite temperatures , the numerical method of the quasiadiabatic propagator path - integral ( quapi ) can be applied by using the tss+ho as the central quantum system exposed to ohmic damping .",
    "this becomes treatable by quapi as the later relies on the technique of cutting the correlations after a finite memory time .",
    "having then studied the decay rates for dephasing and relaxation of a quantum superposition of eigenstates of the tss , we found new features of the dynamics .",
    "this includes at least two inherent frequencies of the time evolution of the tss , as well as pronounced increased dephasing and relaxation if the tss is in resonance with the localized harmonic mode .",
    "our findings clearly demonstrate that the whole frequency spectrum of the peaked environment , and not only its low frequency ohmic part may become relevant in determining the tss relaxation dynamics , if the frequencies of the tss and the ho are comparable . in particular , we showed that , for a peaked environment close to resonance conditions , the commonly used estimate of the decay and relaxation rates to lowest order in the coupling between the tss and the harmonic reservoir becomes inadequate .",
    "the appropriate route is to consider the tss+ho as the quantum system , and then perform perturbation theory in the coupling between such a system and the smooth ohmic environment . to this extent",
    ", we established the redfield equations for the unbiased , resonant tss - ho system .",
    "it turns out that this system can be reduced to a three - level system at temperatures well below the characteristic frequency @xmath0 . within the three - level system approximation",
    ", we have obtained analytic expressions for the relaxation and dephasing rates , which well agree with the numerical quapi rates .",
    "+ finally , we have applied the general model to experimentally realized superconducting flux qubits coupled to a dc - squid playing the role of the detector .",
