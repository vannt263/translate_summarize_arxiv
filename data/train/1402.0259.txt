    "one can see that our model fits well with the experimental data for mosfet in all ranges ; for hemt there is a slight deviation from experiment at high intensities .",
    "it is worth noting that the photoresponse model accuracy depends on the accuracy of the channel current model . for mosfets",
    "the dc current is well described by eq .  .",
    "however currently there is no a single well developed model of @xmath101 which takes into account all effects corresponding to hemt transistors .",
    "therefore , the accuracy of the experiment described by model eq .   for hemt",
    "is slightly less than for mosfet transistors .    performing the simulations with difrent sets of parameters",
    "we have observed that in principle the saturation behaviuor can be also explained by transistor heating by incoming radiation .",
    "however we found that reproducing the saturation requires unrealistically high temperatures .",
    "therefore we can with certainty state that the current saturation ( similar to one observed in standard dc characteristics ) is the dominating effect responsible for thz signal saturation at high radiation intensities .",
    "to summarize , the detection by field effect transistors in broadband non - resonant regime was observed in wide intensity range from 0.5  mw/@xmath0 up to 500  kw/@xmath0 at the frequency range from 0.13  thz up to 3.3  thz .",
    "we demonstrate that detection can be linear with respect to radiation intensity up to several kw/@xmath0 and then it saturates . the signal behavior in wide range of radiation intensity",
    "is interpreted in the frame of the generalized model of thz fet detection .",
    "this model takes into account the nonlinear behavior of the transistor characteristics which is important at high level of photoresponse .",
    "the model quantitatively explain experimental data both in linear and nonlinear ( saturation ) range showing that dynamic range of field effect transistors based terahertz detectors extends over many orders of magnitude .",
