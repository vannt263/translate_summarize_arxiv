    "was performed in @xcite using the criterion for black hole formation derived by shibata and sasaki @xcite which refers to the the metric perturbation rather than the density field .",
    "however , given the large uncertainties involved the results obtained by the two methods were shown to be consistent .",

    "schechter approximation was originally proposed in the context of initial gaussian density perturbations and was much later generalized to accommodate non - gaussian initial conditions @xcite .",

    "this generalization has successfully reproduced the results obtained from @xmath27-body simulations with non - gaussian initial conditions @xcite but it has been shown in ref . @xcite that it does not adequately solve the cloud - in - cloud problem ( see also ref .",
    "although this means that in many models @xmath24 is not expected to be exactly constant , it will in general be of order unity .",
    "consequently this small uncertainty will have a negligible impact on our final results and we shall not consider it further in the following analysis ( we will use @xmath28 throughout the paper ) .    the precise value of the threshold value @xmath22 relevant for the calculation of the phb abundance is uncertain but we shall use the standard value , @xmath29 , for a radiation dominated universe @xcite . although there should also be a finite upper limit to the integration in eq .",

    "an overdense region in order to collapse must be larger than the jeans length at maximum expansion which , in the radiation dominated era , is @xmath30 times the horizon size . on the other hand , it can not be larger than the horizon size or otherwise it would form a closed universe separate from our own @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", here we will assume that pbhs will form with roughly the horizon mass .",
    "this assumption is only approximately true ( in general the mass of primordial black holes is expected to depend on the amplitude , size and shape of the perturbations ) .",
    "it will nevertheless have a small impact on our main results .",
    "hence , when the comoving scale @xmath31 enters the horizon the horizon mass is m_h= ( c / h)^-3 , and primordial black holes with a mass @xmath32 may form at that time . in the radiation dominated era @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom ( we approximate the temperature and entropy degrees of freedom as equal ) .",
    "this implies that m_h= ( _ , 0)^1/2 h_0 r^2 ( ) ^1/6 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath35 it is straightforward to show that [ rm ] = 5 10 ^ -24 ( ) ^1/2 ( ) ^1/12 . the number of relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath36 , in the early universe is expected to be of order @xmath37 . however , the smoothing scale @xmath14 is only weakly dependent on @xmath36 ( note that eq .",
    "( [ rm ] ) corrects a minor error in ref .",
    "we consider an initial density field with a chi - squared probability distribution function ( pdf ) with @xmath1 degrees of freedom , the pdf having been shifted so that its mean is zero ( such a pdf becomes gaussian when @xmath2 ) .",

    "we plot the pbh abundance as a function of black hole mass assuming a power - law spectra with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( sets of curves from left to right respectively ) .",
    "the gaussian model is represented by a solid line and the dashed , dot - dashed and dotted lines represent @xmath0 models with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 degrees of freedom respectively .",
    "we clearly see that even a small amount of non - gaussianity may have a large impact on the estimated pbh abundance .",
    "this shows that an improper use of the standard gaussian assumption may introduce errors on the estimated pbh abundance of many orders of magnitude .",
    "it is useful to determine the impact of non - gaussianity on the spectral index constraint , @xmath51 .",
    "we clearly see from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that for @xmath0 models with a finite numbers of degrees of freedom the constraints are strengthened since for the same value of the spectral index the phb abundance is significantly increased .",
    "still , this will at most shift the spectral index constraint down by about @xmath52 ( in the most extreme case with @xmath53 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to ask how much larger the amplitude of the perturbations has to be in a standard gaussian model relative to a @xmath0 model in order for the mass functions @xmath21 at a given mass to be the same .",
    "an answer to this question is easily obtained by solving the equations ( x ) & = & f ( > m ) , + q(/2 , x + /2 ) & = & f ( > m ) . with respect to @xmath49 for a given @xmath1 and @xmath21 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "as expected we clearly see that if @xmath1 is increased then @xmath49 decreases ( approaching @xmath50 when @xmath2 ) .",
    "also , for a fixed @xmath1 a smaller @xmath21 implies a larger @xmath49 since the differences between gaussian and @xmath0 probability distribution functions ( for @xmath54 ) become more dramatic as we move deeper into the distribution tail .    in this study",
    "we do not compute the pbh for any specific model of inflation .",
    "still , we expect the @xmath0 class of models we investigate in this paper to be representative of a large family of non - gaussian models which may be realized in the context of specific inflationary scenarios .",
    "the simple assumptions made in this paper also have the advantage of allowing for a complete separation between the effect of the power spectrum ( which controls the amplitude of density perturbations on the scales relevant for the calculation of pbhs abundances ) from the distribution of the phases of the various fourier modes .",
    "although , it is possible to consider stronger deviations from a gaussian random distribution which would modify the constraints even further , it might be difficult to construct realistic models where such deviations are incorporated in a natural way .",
