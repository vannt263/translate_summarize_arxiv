    "@xcite have proposed an absolute spectral flux density scale valid from 1 to 50 ghz , based on the known absolute emission spectrum from the planet mars ( @xcite ) , and employing accurate flux density ratios derived by the vla approximately yearly since 1983 .",
    "they propose that the quasar 3c286 , whose flux density has been stable to @xmath11% over the past 30 years , be employed as the primary flux density calibrator source for frequencies between 1 through 50 ghz , and provide a polynomial expression for its spectral flux density .",
    "in addition , @xcite provide time - variable polynomial expressions for the spectral flux densities of 3c48 , 3c138 , and 3c147 .",
    "the vla , prior to its upgrade , always provided full polarization information when used in its standard continuum operating modes .",
    "the nineteen separate observing sessions utilized by @xcite provides a detailed database from which the polarization properties of the fourteen target sources can be determined .",
    "in addition , since the planet mars was extensively observed in this program , its well known polarization characteristics can be utilized to establish the true position angle of polarized emission of the other sources .    in this paper",
    ", we briefly describe the polarization calibration procedure , and give results for the integrated polarization properties of the four most compact sources in the program ",
    "3c48 , 3c138 , 3c147 , and 3c286 .",
    "the observing methodology and calibration procedures are described in detail in @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the additional calibration steps employed to determine the antenna polarization , and the position angle of linearly polarized flux density are given below .",
    "* the position angle rotation introduced by the earth s ionosphere was estimated by utilizing tec data from the cddis data archive with a model of the earth s magnetic field .",
    "the predicted corresponding phase rotation was applied to the lcp data .",
    "the correction is typically a few degrees at 1.5 ghz , and is unimportant above @xmath15 ghz . *",
    "the antenna polarizations were measured utilizing the technique of @xcite which utilizes the rotation of the antenna parallactic angle , @xmath2 , over time .",
    "this rotation permits a separation of the antenna from the source polarizations , and provides estimates of each . *",
    "the plane of linear polarization was based initially by adjusting the phase of the lcp channel so the observed position angle of the polarized flux density from 3c286 was 33 degrees at all frequencies .    following this calibration procedure , images for all sources in stokes parameters q and u",
    "were made for each epoch .",
    "the polarized images of the optically thin unpolarized source ngc7027 demonstrate the accurcy of our determinations of the fractional polarization to be typically 0.1% .",
    "our observing program comprised fourteen sources , observed at all vla frequency bands in the lowest - resolution ` d ' configuration .",
    "the polarization imaging results for the heavily resolved sources 3c123 , 3c196 , and 3c295 show a complicated polarization pattern , with very low integrated polarization . because of this , these sources are not useful as polarization calibrators .",
    "no linear polarization , to a limit @xmath1 0.1% , was found for the planetary nebulae ngc7027 and ngc6572 , the evolved star mwc349 , and the planets uranus and neptune .",
    "venus does show some polarization from its surface at low frequencies , but the quality of the data and the resolution of the images are both too low for these results to be useful .",
    "the sources 3c48 , 3c138 , 3c147 , and 3c286 are all significantly polarized at most frequencies utilized by the vla .",
    "all are very compact , and are thus useful for polarization calibration purposes , providing their integrated polarization properties are at most slowly variable .",
    "the planet mars was sufficiently resolved on twelve observing sessions at our higher frequencies that its polarization can be imaged and utilized to calibrate the position angle for the other sources .",
    "the procedure is described in the following section .",
    "most vla users have adopted the value of 33 degrees for the position angle of the linearly polarized flux density of 3c286 at all frequencies .",
    "this value was determined by @xcite with a quoted error of @xmath3 degrees , and is based on observations at 6.7 ghz with the algonquin radio telescope .",
    "@xcite also give a position angle of 31@xmath4 degrees for 3c286 at 10.7 ghz .",
    "we are not aware of any systematic effort to measure the true position angle of 3c286 at other frequencies in order to check the common assumption that the position angle is independent of wavelength .",
    "our observations of mars provide the capability to make this check for the higher frequencies where we are able to resolve the planet s disk , as the emission of blackbody radiation from a planet such as mars will show a radially oriented linear polarization which maximizes near the limb of the planet ( @xcite ) .    for a solid body such as mars , the thermal radio emission originates from beneath the surface , which upon crossing the surface , is refracted according to snell s law @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the propagation angle with respect to the surface normal",
    ", @xmath7 is the index of refraction , @xmath8 is the dielectric constant for the particular medium , and the subscripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the media for the incident and transmitted radiation .",
    "( we assume non - magnetic media , for which @xmath11 ) .",
    "because of the change in media properties at the planetary surface , from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , part of the emerging wave is reflected , and part transmitted .",
    "the fraction transmitted depends upon the angle of incidence , the dielectric constant , and the polarization .",
    "the transmissivity ( defined as the fraction of the incident power which is transmitted across the boundary ) is given by @xcite @xmath14 the parallel linear polarization component lies in the plane defined by the incident and transmitted propagation directions .",
    "the perpendicular component is orthogonal to this plane .    assuming a simple model where mars is a uniform sphere of radius @xmath15 , the radiation emitted towards the observer from a location with perpendicular offset @xmath16 from the center of the visible disk leaves the planet surface at angle @xmath17 to the local planet normal . defining @xmath18 as the fractional perpendicular offset from the planet center ,",
    "the transmissivity can be written , using equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) as @xmath19 the parallel component is radially oriented , and the perpendicular component is azimuthally oriented .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "further , @xmath22 rises from the planet center outwards , reaches a maximum of unity at the brewster angle , @xmath23 , and falls dramatically thereafter , while @xmath24 declines uniformly with offset .",
    "hence , the observed emission will be radially polarized , with the fractional polarization increasing with offset .",
    "the fractional degree of polarization @xmath25 is a strong function of the planet dielectric constant @xmath8 , rising from zero at the planet center to a maximum very near to the planet s limb ( @xcite ) . for mars , with @xmath26 ( @xcite )",
    ", the maximum linear polarization would exceed 30% , were the martian surface smooth .    finite angular resolution and surface roughness",
    "will reduce the observed fractional polarization ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but the radial position angle relation will be preserved on large scales , allowing a position angle calibration to be established for observations which adequately resolve the planet s disk .    to illustrate this effect ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : qmars99 ] images of the polarized intensity , and the position angle of the polarized intensity at 43 ghz , taken from our observations on april 16 , 1999 , when mars had an angular diameter of 15.6 arcseconds .",
    "the instrumental resolution is 2.0 arcseconds .",
    "twelve of the thirteen observing sessions which included the planet mars were taken when mars had an angular diameter sufficiently large to resolve its polarization in at least one frequency band .",
    "for these sessions , we made polarization images of mars at all frequencies where there were at least three resolution elements across the planet .",
    "the lowest frequency at which this could be done for our observations was 5 ghz .",
    "a special aips task was written to find the mean deviation of the observed position angle around the planet s disk from the radial direction .",
    "this deviation was then added to the assumed value of 33 degrees for 3c286 to determine the correct position angle for that source .",
    "the measured position angles for the remaining sources were subsequently corrected using this offset .",
    "the observed deviations , and ( 1-@xmath27 ) error are given in table  [ tab : pangle ] .",
    "the bottom line in table  [ tab : pangle ] gives the weighted mean of the data and the probable error .",
    "a small but significant offset is found .",

    "their paper shows that the emission from 3c48 on milliarcsecond scales is quite complicated , with a short and twisted jet - like structure blending into an extended region located to the ne of the quasar core .",
    "our global rotation measure value of -68 @xmath60 is in good agreement with the ` spot ' values from their component ` c ' of -68 to -95 @xmath60 .",
    "the merlin polarimetric image at 1.65 ghz shows the weak polarized emission aligned nearly vertically , in good agreement with our integrated value of -5 degrees at 1.64 ghz .",
    "the heavily resolved vlba images shown in their figure 6 at 4.78 and 8.31 ghz are difficult to compare to our integrated values , but the polarized position angles shown are close to our integrated values .",
    "high resolution vla images taken at 26 ghz with 70 mas resolution show the majority of the polarized emission coming from bright northern component labelled ` c ' in @xcite , with the more compact structures labeled by them at ` b ' , ` b2 ' , and ` b3 ' .      the small - scale structure is shown in @xcite to comprise a relative weak unresolved nuclear core , a strong and well  resolved jet - like structure extending @xmath1400 milliarcseconds to the ne , and a very weak counter - jet 250 milliarcseconds to the sw .",
    "the ne jet is highly and uniformly polarized , and accounts for nearly all the total polarized emission seen in our integrated measures .",
    "their figure 4 shows the weaker , trailing parts of the ne jet to have a linearly polarized emission at p.a . @xmath1 -25 degrees , while the much brighter head of the jet to have its polarized emission at an angle near 0 .",
    "the sum of the two components is near our integrated measure of @xmath1 - 10 degrees .",
    "our data show the position angle to decrease by about 15 degrees as the frequency rises  this is probably due to a spectral index effect whereby the head of the ne jet becomes more prominent compared to the steeper spectrum trailing areas .",
    "the decline in integrated polarization , and decrease in the resulting position angle , seen since 2002 at the higher frequencies are likely due to an emerging new component along p.a . near -30",
    "( as shown in figure 6 in @xcite ) with polarization along this angle .",
    "vlba polarimetric imaging at 5 and 8 ghz for 3c147 has been presented by @xcite . at milliarcsecond resolution ,",
    "the source comprises a compact core and apparently rapidly expanding jet , extending only @xmath110 milliarcseconds to the sw .",
    "beyond this , a very diffuse and well - resolved lobe extends to the sw to a maximum extent of @xmath61 milliarcseconds .",
    "high resolution vla observations at @xmath170 milliarcseconds resolution show another , more extended and detached elogated lobe extending northwards @xmath1 700 milliarcseconds .",
    "3c147 has an extremely high rm of -1467 @xmath60 , in good agreement with the value resported by @xcite for their component b , located at the end of the inner , flaring jet .",
    "high resolution vla polarimetric imaging at 25 ghz with 70 milliarcsecond resolution shows that the nucleus and inner jet regions dominate the total polarized flux density .",
    "the true integrated position angle of 88 degrees from our integrated measures agrees well with the intrinsic angle for the b - field of the flaring jet shown by @xcite in their figure 7 .",
    "the quasar 3c286 was selected by @xcite as the primary non - variable flux density standard from 1 to 50 ghz , based on the stability of its total intensity over period exceeding 30-years .",
    "this current study shows that 3c286 also serves as an equally useful and stable reference source for polarimetry .",
    "although we detect a very small secular increase in its polarized flux density , the change appears to be steady , permitting easy calculation of the expected polarized flux density at any epoch .",
    "high resolution polarimetry of this source is shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter paper sketches the overall structure , comprising a central core , a compact eastern lobe about 1 arcsecond east , and an extended western lobe , extending @xmath1 2.5 arcseconds to the se .",
    "the central core region contains a highly polarized extension of length @xmath180 milliarcseconds , in p.a .",
    "135 degrees ",
    "i.e. , pointing towards the se lobe .",
    "both the total and polarized emission from this source are unusual .",
    "there is no clearly defined inverted spectrum core , suggesting either a dearth of recent activity , or a geometry whereby the core emission is beamed away from our direction .",
    "the polarized emission is almost entirely along the jet , contrary to the general rule where jet emission is primarily polarized transversely to the jet axis .",
    "3c286 has recently been proposed by @xcite as a polarization calibration source for millimeter - wavelength observations .",
    "their results are in excellent agreement with a simple extrapolation of ours : a polarization fraction of 13.5% and an intrinsic position angle of 37.4 degrees at @xmath62 mm .",
    "@xcite also provide values at @xmath63 mm of 14.5% and 33.5 degrees  however , these have much larger error estimates , and are not inconsistent with our results .",
    "we have determined that the position angle of linearly polarized emission from 3c286 rises from 33 degrees at frequencies below 10 ghz , to 36 degrees at 43 ghz .",
    "changes in this position angle over time are less than @xmath12 degrees over the past 20 years .",
    "the fractional linear polarization of 3c286 is steadily increasing at all frequencies at a rate of about 0.15%/year .",
    "the polarization characteristics of 3c48 and 3c147 are fairly stable , but small changes , likely related to the small variations in total intensity noted by @xcite are visible .",
    "the polarization position angles for these two objects for frequencies at which their fractional polarization exceed 1% are well fitted with a simple @xmath45 law over most of the observed frequency range .",
    "the strongly polarized source 3c138 has undergone a notable flare , beginning in 2003 , which nearly doubled its total intensity by 2010 , and has been rapidly declining since .",
    "the polarization properties also changed dramatically during this period , and appear to be returning to the pre - flare levels .",
