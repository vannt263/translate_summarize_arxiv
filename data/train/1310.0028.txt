    "[ [ section ] ]    the generation of entanglement is an essential tool for the realization of scalable quantum computing and long distance quantum communication .",
    "the ability to entangle a photon for reliable long range quantum communication and another particle with a long - term quantum memory would allow for the construction of such a scalable quantum network .",
    "large strides have been made towards this in many different physical media .",
    "entanglement and the means for communication have been demonstrated most recently in quantum dots @xcite , nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond @xcite , neutral atoms @xcite , atomic ensembles @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite , and ions @xcite .",
    "here we report on entanglement and bell inequality violation in a system of a photon and a ^138^ba^+^ ion .",
    "this system is particularly well suited for quantum computation @xcite and communication because its transitions have relatively long wavelengths making them more suitable for long range fiber optic transmission .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in this experiment , entanglement was produced by spontaneous emission of a photon from an excited ^138^ba^+^ ion with multiple decay channels similar to @xcite .",
    "the two entangled qubits were the zeeman sublevels of the @xmath1 ground state of the ion and the emitted photon s polarization .",
    "entanglement was verified by performing state detection on each qubit in two non - orthogonal bases .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the famous 1935 paper by einstein , podolsky , and rosen concluded that the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics was not complete @xcite .",
    "this was based on the observation that entangled quantum systems require nature to be nonlocal or non - real . however in 1964 , john bell demonstrated that the principles of locality and realism assumed by einstein , podolsky , and rosen in their paper were inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the mathematical formalism he presented gave an inequality that must be obeyed by any theory satisfying local realism .",
    "many experimental tests have shown violations of some form of the bell inequality @xcite , however none have simultaneously closed both of the major loopholes ( the detection , or  fair sampling , \" loophole and the locality loophole ) associated with such a measurement .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    in our experiment , we demonstrate violation of the bell inequality of the form suggested by clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( chsh ) @xcite . experimental tests of the chsh inequality have three requirements : ( 1 ) repeated creation of entangled pairs of qubits , ( 2 ) the ability to rotate each qubit independently through a polar angle @xmath2 , @xmath3 on the bloch sphere , and ( 3 ) state measurement of each qubit . chsh show that all theories satisfying local realism must obey the following inequality : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a correlation function measurement , and @xmath6 is the fraction of the total events in which qubits a and b are found to be in states denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively following rotations of the qubits by polar angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively on the bloch sphere .    [ [ section-4 ] ]    quantum mechanics predicts that the chsh inequality can be violated for particular entangled states and measurements .",
    "for example , given the bell state @xmath9 , one calculates the corresponding correlation function @xmath10 .",
    "this results in a violation of eq .",
    "( [ chsh ] ) for certain angles and maximum violation @xmath11 for @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    the bell signal measured in an experiment can be reduced , however , by infidelity in the state that is produced .",
    "a measure of entanglement fidelity can be found by calculating a state s overlap with the appropriate maximally entangled bell state @xcite .",
    "thus with respect to the particular bell state @xmath9 , the fidelity is given by the expectation value of the density matrix ( @xmath16 ) in the bell state : @xmath17 where @xmath16 is given in the computational basis , @xmath18 .",
    "the first two density matrix elements are just the correlation probabilities of detecting the states @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "these correlation probabilities ( @xmath23 ) are given by the probability of detecting qubit @xmath24 in the state corresponding to @xmath25 multiplied by the conditional probability of detecting qubit @xmath26 in the state corresponding to @xmath25 given that the state of qubit @xmath24 is the state corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "the second two elements can be determined by rotating each qubit s measurement basis by the polar angle @xmath27 on the bloch sphere .",
    "then @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the @xmath27 polar rotation operator with relative phase @xmath30 . with @xmath30",
    "set to zero , one finds that @xmath31 thus we find a lower bound for the fidelity expressed in terms of the correlation probabilities in the original and rotated bases : @xmath32 one also finds the expected bell signal for the angles of maximal violation from the density matrix in the unrotated and rotated bases ( with the relative phase of the rotation @xmath33 ) of : @xmath34",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    the ion was confined in a linear paul trap and doppler cooled on the @xmath1 to @xmath35 transition with a 493 nm laser .",
    "a 650 nm laser was used to repump from the long - lived @xmath36 state ( lifetime @xmath37 s @xcite ) to which the @xmath35 state may decay .",
    "an applied magnetic field @xmath38 gauss provided a quantization axis , and a circularly polarized beam of 493 nm light aligned parallel to the quantization axis was used for optical pumping to either of the two zeeman sublevels of the @xmath1 ground state .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    ionic qubit state detection was accomplished by the use of a stabilized 1762 nm fiber laser to drive the  shelving \" transition from the @xmath1 ( @xmath39 ) ground state sublevel ( defined as @xmath40 ) to the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) metastable sublevel ( lifetime @xmath43 s ) using adiabatic rapid passage sweeps @xcite .",
    "once excited to the @xmath41 shelved state , the ion is removed from the cooling cycle and will appear  dark \" while the cooling lasers are incident on the ion , whereas an unshelved ion will be  bright . \"",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    a dedicated wire loop in the vicinity of the trap inside the vacuum chamber was used to generate a tunable radio frequency ( rf ) magnetic field in order to drive magnetic dipole transitions between the zeeman sublevels for the necessary ion qubit rotations .",
    "an rf synthesizer ( based on a direct digital synthesis ( dds9910 ) chip ) generated a stable sinusoidal voltage which was amplified and dropped over a 50 ohm rf resistor for impedance matching , producing an oscillating current in the loop .",
    "this setup allowed for ion qubit rotations with a tunable phase .",
    "an example of ground state rabi oscillations is shown in fig . [ zeemanflops ] .",

    "finally the ion was weakly excited ( excitation probability @xmath62 ) to the @xmath35 ( @xmath39 ) sublevel ( lifetime @xmath63 @xcite ) with a 20 ns exposure to the optical pumping beam .",
    "this was followed by photon- and ion - state detection .",
    "the photons were detected by the pmts inside a detection window of 20 ns , delayed somewhat from the excitation pulse .",
