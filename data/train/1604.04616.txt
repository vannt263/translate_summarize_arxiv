    "currently , observational experiments show that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion  @xcite .",
    "the most accepted agreement is that there is two components which play a serious and important role in the formation and evolution of the universe ; the so called  dark matter \" ( dm ) , which is responsible for the structure formation and clustering of the galaxies  @xcite and the  dark energy \" ( de ) which makes a negative pressure and thus gives rise to the accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the former has a contribution of about @xmath11% of the total matter density , the latter forms about @xmath12% of it and the rest is related to the baryonic ( visible ) matter  @xcite .",
    "there are two general approaches which can be used to face the problems associated to de and dm .",
    "the first one deals with introducing some matter field(s ) that affect the dynamical evolution of the universe and thereby these observed phenomena may be explained . in the second approach",
    "one can alter the geometrical sector of gr to obtain some theoretical results corresponding to the observational ones . in order to apply the former ,",
    "numerous scenarios have been proposed so far .",
    "the cosmological constant can be accounted for as the most successful and important candidate for de which has a constant eos parameter .",
    "the gr theory comprised by the cosmological constant and dm is called the concordance or the @xmath13 model  @xcite . in spite of high consistency of @xmath13 model with the present observations ,",
    "it suffers from an important problem ; the theoretical value of the de density is not compatible with the observationally accepted one .",
    "indeed , their values differ about @xmath14 orders of magnitude .",
    "this problem is called  the cosmological constant problem \"  @xcite .",
    "the other proposals for the accelerated expansion of the universe are the dynamical de models with time - varying eos e.g. , quintessence and phantom models  @xcite .",
    "however , these models may also include other problems , e.g. , the  fine tuning \" which is a major issue , by which the quintessence models are afflicted .",
    "another candidate for de ( which is the main subject of our study ) is the chaplygin gas ( cg ) model introduced as to explain the de phenomenon  @xcite . following a perfect fluid ,",
    "the eos for this matter is , @xmath15 where @xmath5 is a constant ( this case is called the standard chaplygin gas ( scg ) ) .",
    "it has been shown that the chaplygin cosmology can be interpreted as a transition from a dm dominated universe to an accelerated expansion universe including an intermediate phase with  stiff fluid \" ( which corresponds to a fluid with @xmath16 ) domination  @xcite .",
    "although , the scg model can lead to a transition from a decelerated to accelerated expansion , it can not explain the structure formation and it is encountered some problems with the cosmological power spectrum  @xcite . consequently , the eos of the scg model has been generalized as @xmath17 , to confront the mentioned issues .",
    "note that , the general cg model ( gcg ) gives rise to an intermediate epoch with the eos @xmath18",
    "the gcg model has been used in different areas such as , the de problem  @xcite , matter power spectrum  @xcite and wormholes  @xcite .",
    "the geometrical manipulation of gr is the other approach with the aim of solving some problems such as de and dm . in the past decades , higher order gravity , specially @xmath19",
    "gravity has been introduced by replacing the ricci scalar in the einstein - hilbert action with some scalar invariants .",
    "this model has drawn a remarkable attention among the other models and theories . in @xmath19 theory of gravity ,",
    "one simply replaces the ricci curvature scalar with a function of it .",
    "this theory has had successes and failures in different aspects  @xcite .",
    "as an idea toward the development of @xmath19 gravity , some authors assume that the matter lagrangian is non - minimally coupled to the geometrical sector of the action  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a more complete form of these type of models entitled as @xmath20 gravity is proposed .",
    "another suggestion to couple the matter sector to the geometrical one is to employ the trace of emt .",
    "this model was presented by authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , and various features of this model have been reported in  @xcite .    in the present work we use both approach ,",
    "namely , we work on a model in which gcg and the baryonic matter are considered as the whole matter in @xmath0 gravity as the background geometric law .",
    "simultaneously use of both approach have been already employed in the literature to describe the early or late time phenomena in cosmology  @xcite . since @xmath0 gravity introduces a new approach to involve the interactions of matter effects with spacetime curvature , it is well - motivated to consider cosmological consequences of different types of matter in the framework of this theory .",
    "the gcg in the background of gr involved some issues e.g. , the standard case , namely scg has ruled out by the most observational data or in some works it is reported that only specific subclasses of solutions would pass the observational tests ( i.e. , those with @xmath21 )  @xcite .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have shown that cg produces oscillations or exponential blowup of the power spectrum of dark matter which is not consistent with observations .",
    "particularly , they have reported that @xmath22 of gcg parameter space which previously has been allowed , would be excluded .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been discussed that considering the joint effect of shear and rotation can overcome this instability . in this regard , the study of chaplygin gas in other frameworks such as @xmath0 gravity , in search of a viable dark energy model may leads to more desirable results .",
    "cosmological considerations of every theory of gravity are based on the investigation of the behavior of the hubble and the deceleration parameters which are defined as the first and second order of time derivatives of the scale factor i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the former determines the expansion of the universe and the latter indicates the acceleration / deceleration behavior .",
    "the de models are constructed so as to match them with the observations .",
    "for this reason , the most consistent de models give the same present values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , there is some type of degeneracy in the present values , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . to deal with this issue",
    ", various strategies have been proposed .",
    "the statefinder diagnosis is an efficient tool to discriminate different de models .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite introduced new cosmological parameters constructed out of the third order of time derivative of the scale factor which are called  statefinder parameters \" and are denoted by the pair ( @xmath29 ) . since , this tool use the different orders of the time derivative of the scale factor , it is a geometrical diagnosis .",
    "this method can distinguish between de models that have the same values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , in a higher level .",
    "note that this method can be extended to the models with higher degrees of degeneracy . in the statefinder diagnostic tool",
    ", the de models indicated by the ( @xmath30 ) plane trajectories and in this way one could consider the behavior of different de models and thus discriminate them .",
    "we have mentioned that the @xmath31 model is still good fitted to the observation and therefore the suggested de models should not be so far from this model . to understand this fact , the difference between the predicted present values @xmath32 and @xmath33 of models and the corresponding values of @xmath31 model ( @xmath34 ) is a criteria for distinction of the de models ( this difference is called  distance of model \" ) .    up to now , different de models are diagnosed which are mainly of scalar field type models , such as @xmath31 and quintessence de models which have been considered in  @xcite and are accounted for as the first research works that introduced the statefinder diagnostic tool , the interacting quintessence models  @xcite , the holographic de models  @xcite , the holographic de model in a non - flat universe  @xcite , the phantom model  @xcite , the tachyon model  @xcite , the gcg model  @xcite and the interacting new agegraphic de model in a flat and a non - flat universe  @xcite .",
    "we plan our investigations as follows : in sec .  [ fieldequations ] , we start with presenting the action of @xmath0 gravity and obtain the related field equations and a constraint that must be satisfied by the function @xmath0 in order to guarantee the conservation of emt .",
    "we devote the rest of this section to present the procedure of obtaining the function @xmath0 . for some reasons we presume a linear combination of the matter and curvature sectors of the lagrangian , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "this choice facilitates the procedure of obtaining @xmath0 function using the emt conservation and makes us capable of getting exact solutions .",
    "minimal couplings respect the emt conservation and for these type of models all equations and solutions can be easily reduced to gr .",
    "these models can be seen as a modification to gr .",
    "also , the models including minimal couplings respect the equivalence principle , in spite of non - minimal ones which show some violation , in this respect  @xcite .",
    "we get three classes of @xmath0 function .",
    "class i for the scg model , class ii for the gcg model in high pressure situations and class iii for the gcg model in high density regimes . in sec .",
    "[ eq - def ] we introduce the statefinder parameters and obtain them for these three models .",
    "moreover , we bring forward some cosmological parameters that are helpful for the rest of our study . in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] , we present adequate numerical plots to show and discuss the cosmological consequences of these three models .",
    "[ test ] has been devoted to testing models i , ii and iii using the recent observational data via the chi - square technique and finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we summerize our results .",
    "in this section we present the field equation of @xmath0 theory of gravity and also discuss the conservation of emt when two pressureless baryonic matter and gcg are taken into account . by including the two forms of matters , the action of @xmath0 theory of gravity can be written as @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the lagrangian of the total matter as @xmath37 in the above equations @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the ricci curvature scalar , the trace of emt of the baryonic matter and gcg ( which we get these fluids as the total matter content of the universe ) and the lagrangian of the total matter , respectively .",
    "the superscripts @xmath41 and @xmath42 stand for the baryonic matter and gcg , @xmath43 is the determinant of the metric and we set @xmath44 .",
    "the emt @xmath45 is defined as the euler - lagrange expression of the lagrangian of the total matter , i.e. , @xmath46}{\\delta g^{\\mu \\nu}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    instead of obtaining the field equations for the action ( [ action ] ) , it is sufficient to obtain the corresponding field equations of @xmath0 gravity for general trace @xmath47 and the matter lagrangian @xmath48 , and then solve them using the related quantities of the two forms of matters ; namely , the baryonic matter and gcg . if in the action ( [ action ] ) , the trace @xmath49 and @xmath50 are replaced by trace @xmath47 and @xmath51 , respectively , the field equations for @xmath0 gravity can be obtained as  @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 and , for the sake of convenience , we have defined the following functions for the derivatives with respect to the trace @xmath47 and the ricci curvature scalar @xmath38 @xmath54 assuming a perfect fluid and a spatially flat friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) metric @xmath55 together with using equation ( [ frt field equations ] ) , the generalized friedmann equation for a perfect fluid with non - zero pressure is achieved as @xmath56    applying the bianchi identity to the field equation ( [ frt field equations ] ) leads to the following constraint for multi perfect fluids @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of included perfect fluids .",
    "constraint ( [ constraint1 ] ) for a pressureless matter reduces to @xmath59 equations ( [ constraint1 ] ) and ( [ constraint2 ] ) are two constraints that restrict the form of the lagrangian density @xmath60 in our case .",
    "these constraints guarantee the conservation of emt which is imposed by the bianchi identity .",
    "therefore , to obtain the hubble parameter from equation ( [ friedmann ] ) , we need to find the function @xmath61 that satisfy these constraints .",
    "generally , function @xmath61 can take an arbitrary form in equations ( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ constraint1 ] ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", viable models of @xmath0 gravity can be classified in the following manner  @xcite    * the @xmath35 models which have been mostly considered in the literature .",
    "we can enumerate some motivations to propose these type of models ; ( i ) equations of motion and the related calculations are more tractable in the framework of these models as compared to the other ones , such that one can always simply obtain the gr results by switching off the function @xmath9 . from mathematical point of view , in each theory modest field equations can result in exact solutions without resorting to numerical methods .",
    "( ii ) these models can be seen as a trivial modification to gr which depends on the matter content ( regardless of the simplest possibility , i.e. , adding a cosmological constant ) . in this regard",
    ", a simple correction may lead to some plausible results comparing with the other type of corrections .",
    "these models may also connect to other theories , for example , those in which the cosmological constant clearly depends on the trace of emt which is called  @xmath62 gravity \" in the literature  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) since any theory of modified gravity must be reduced to the einstein - hilbert action at low curvature regimes , for more complicated @xmath0 functions , gr may not be recovered .",
    "( iv ) these models are well - defined for cosmological fluids with @xmath63 , like radiation ( as we will see the third type of models may show some inconsistencies ) . (",
    "v ) the emt conservation tells us that for a linear combination of curvature and matter sectors we can determine the form of @xmath9 function up to some integration constants .",
    "however , for complicated forms , this option may not be accessible .",
    "particularly , in our work the emt conservation leads to an intricate function for the standard chaplygin gas , see expression ( [ frt - i ] ) .",
    "therefore a reasonable choice is to consider the contribution due to the trace of emt into lagrangian density , linearly .",
    "such a setting makes calculations rough enough to take the ricci scalar instead of an arbitrary function of it , as the geometrical part of the action .",
    "* models with arbitrary forms for the ricci scalar but minimal coupling to the emt trace : @xmath1 .",
    "these cases can be accounted for corrections on @xmath19 gravity which may cure possible deficiencies of these theories . as some of the above motivations are still mentionable for these class of models",
    ", the complexities involved in the @xmath64 function may lead to some problems such as finding exact solutions . in the present work ,",
    "the benefit of choosing the simple form @xmath2 is to obtain the hubble parameter in terms of the matter terms , in a straightforward way .",
    "we note that the exact form of the hubble parameter is needed in order to calculate the statefinder parameters , see e.g. , equation ( [ hubble ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that from equation ( [ friedmann ] ) , for cases in which @xmath65 the hubble parameter may not be obtained exactly . * the models with @xmath66 .",
    "the field equations for these type of models can be so complicated due to non - minimal coupling term .",
    "these categories suffer from an important problem .",
    "since for an ultra relativistic fluid the trace of emt is vanished , the models with non - minimal coupling between the geometrical and matter sectors in the lagrangian can become singular . optimistically , these cases reduce to @xmath19 gravity similar to the cases discussed in the above items . for instance , the actions with a pure non - minimal term ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) can become either singular ( eg . , @xmath68 ) or null , since the trace of ultra relativistic matter is vanished .",
    "another issue is that , the excellent information about the function @xmath9 which can be extracted from the models with linear combinations may be lost even for simple forms of @xmath69 . as a result ,",
    "equation ( [ constraint2 ] ) turns into a completely complicated expression in terms of second time derivative of the hubble parameter once non - minimal couplings are allowed .",
    "this in turn leaves us without any reasonable outcome for @xmath9 function .",
    "the major concern of theories including non - minimal couplings in the lagrangian is that they could lead to the violation of the equivalence principle  @xcite .    motivated by the above discussion",
    ", we consider a function of the following form @xmath70 using definitions ( [ f definitions1 ] ) and the ansatz ( [ frt function ] ) we get @xmath71 where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "applying the derivatives ( [ f definitions2 ] ) to equation ( [ friedmann ] ) leaves us with the following relation @xmath72 where the summation should be done over all terms corresponding to the two forms of matter . notice",
    "that , hereafter the arguments in @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 will be dropped for simplicity until we may restore them for some purposes .    for a perfect fluid with @xmath76 ,",
    "the constraint ( [ constraint1 ] ) using the trace @xmath77 and the conservation equation @xmath78 , could in principle leads to a differential equation for the function @xmath0 .",
    "for the expression ( [ frt function ] ) it reads @xmath79}=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , assuming that the two matters do not interact with each other , we can obtain @xmath80 since the signature of metric ( [ metricfrw ] ) implies @xmath81 for the pressureless matter , equation ( [ de - m ] ) gives @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are constants of integration .",
    "now we try to solve equation ( [ de - g ] ) for gcg .",
    "the eos for gcg is written as @xmath85 equation ( [ chaplygin - p ] ) together with the equation of the emt conservation @xmath86 lead to the following solution for the matter density of gcg @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath6 and @xmath89 are some constant which have to satisfy the conditions @xmath90 and @xmath91  . setting @xmath92 , we can rewrite ( [ chaplygin - rho1 ] ) in a suitable form as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the scale factor and @xmath95 . for later applications we rewrite ( [ chaplygin - rho2 ] ) as @xmath96 where @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "note that , the argument @xmath99 denotes the variation with respect to the scale factor for constant values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "substituting equation ( [ chaplygin - p ] ) in ( [ de - g ] ) together with using @xmath100 and @xmath101 , we get @xmath102 the left hand side of equation ( [ conservedfunction - g1 ] ) is in terms of @xmath103 while the right hand side is a function of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which shows that it is not a closed deferential equation . to complete it ,",
    "the trace of emt of gcg can be rewritten as the following form @xmath106 by solving equation ( [ trace - g ] ) , in principle , we can obtain the matter density @xmath104 in terms of the gcg trace , and then , substitute it into equations ( [ chaplygin - p ] ) and ( [ conservedfunction - g1 ] ) to get a closed differential equation in terms of the pure trace @xmath103 . unfortunately , this is not a straightforward calculation , since equation ( [ trace - g ] ) admits a lot of roots that depend on the value @xmath6 ( equation ( [ trace - g ] ) can be problematic when non - integer values of @xmath6 are included as well ) .",
    "furthermore , the solutions can get complicated forms such that the differential equation ( [ conservedfunction - g1 ] ) may not be solved . however , for the case of the standard chaplygin gas ( scg ) , namely , @xmath107 the solutions are tractable and for the other values we use the approximation methods . equation ( [ trace - g ] ) for @xmath107 has the following solutions @xmath108 where superscript  s \" stands for scg . since , @xmath109 can get negative values and thus violates the weak energy condition ( wec ) , we discard it as a non - physical solution .",
    "we then consider the solution @xmath110 . by",
    "setting @xmath107 in equation ( [ conservedfunction - g1 ] ) , and using ( [ rho - g - exact ] ) we have @xmath111 and , we finally obtain the following differential equation @xmath112 where the solution @xmath113 corresponds to @xmath114 . the solutions of the above differential equation are obtained as @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are constants of integration . as a result , in @xmath0 theory of gravity , for the non - interacting baryonic matter and scg ,",
    "the conservation of emt enforces us to use the following function @xmath118 where we have restored the argument of function @xmath119 for clarification and dropped the sign  @xmath120 \" . also , we have added the superscript i for later applications and @xmath121 . nevertheless , we consider two another model ; the models which use gcg in two extreme situations , i.e. , when @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "these cases will be considered for arbitrary values of @xmath6 . in either cases we approximate @xmath124 and @xmath125 . in these cases , using equation ( [ de - g ] ) , the related differential equations are given as @xmath126 for which the solutions are found as @xmath127 and @xmath128 where we have restored again the arguments and labeled the equations and solutions by @xmath129 and @xmath130 that denote the either extreme cases and @xmath131 and @xmath132 with @xmath133 are integral constants .",
    "thus , we have two another forms for @xmath0 function , i.e. , @xmath134 for @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 for @xmath138 , where @xmath139 .",
    "note that , there are two sets of constants labeled by the numbers @xmath140 and @xmath141 which determine the degree of involved differential equations .",
    "therefore , we have three classes of non - interacting models including pressureless baryonic and three forms of cg ; in the first one we have scg represented by the function ( [ frt - i ] ) , the second one uses gcg when the matter density is negligible in comparison with the pressure as shown by the function ( [ frt - ii ] ) , and in the last case , the gcg matter density is dominant which is determined by function ( [ frt - iii ] ) .",
    "note that , from equations ( [ chaplygin - p ] ) and ( [ chaplygin - rho2 ] ) , the eos parameter @xmath142 for gcg can be obtained . at the early time ( @xmath143 ) , we have @xmath144 , and at the late time ( @xmath145 ) , @xmath146 .",
    "this means that the gcg in the early time behaves like cdm and in the late time like de .",
    "therefore , we assume that de and cdm are unified by gcg model . besides , we have the baryonic matter indicated by superscript  b \" which does not interact with gcg component .    in the next section , we present the statefinder parameters and obtain them for these three models , and also get the deceleration parameter and define the effective eos , as well .",
    "henceforth , we will call these as , models i , ii and iii .",
    "in this section , we present the definitions of the statefinder parameters and calculate them for models i , ii and iii .",

    "future measurements like snia data from the large synaptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , the supernovae acceleration probe ( snap ) and x - ray cluster data from constellation - x may provide better constraints on the statefinder parameters . the baryon oscillation experiment which is applied in galaxy redshift surveys for high - redshift ranges can also make tighter constraint on these parameters .",
    "using equations ( [ qi ] ) and ( [ eos ] ) , the cosmological evolution of the eos parameter for this model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ wi ] , for specific values @xmath188 and @xmath189 with @xmath190 .",
    "moreover , we have plotted the corresponding diagrams for the standard case @xmath191 ( i.e. , for gr , as we have before mentioned ) in order to indicate possible deviations . the zero value for @xmath5 ,",

    "since , there are generally some divergences in the cases with positive values of @xmath199 and @xmath7 ( which occur in a certain value of @xmath200 , for some values of @xmath5 ) , the evolution of the related eos parameter is not depicted in fig .",
    "physically , this divergence causes a total increase in the value of the deceleration parameter after the matter dominated era s . ] . hence ,",
    "positive values for the coupling constants @xmath201 , can lead to non - physical behaviors and we discard such cases as the less physically interesting models .",
    "however , one may find some curves without divergence for positive values .",
    "for example , for @xmath202 and @xmath203 we can obtain the acceptable value @xmath204 consistent with the recent results  @xcite .",
    "plots in fig .",

    "decreasing the parameter @xmath199 for @xmath179 , leads to smaller values of @xmath207 for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "by contrast , decreasing in the parameter @xmath7 for @xmath208 , gives smaller values for @xmath209 and larger values for @xmath210 .",
    "to understand the reason of this dual behavior , we calculate the present value of @xmath164 for @xmath208 , as @xmath211 as we see , for special case @xmath212 , the effective eos is independent of the parameter @xmath7 and for a given @xmath7 , the value of @xmath213 increases for @xmath210 and decreases for @xmath209 .",
    "calculations show that when @xmath206 , the mutual behavior is absent and in these situations a decrease in @xmath7 leads to an increase in @xmath213 for all values of @xmath5 ( compare lower diagrams in fig .",
    "therefore , in lower right diagram we see a total decrease in the value of @xmath213 ( a decrease due to the effect of @xmath206 and an increase due to the effect of @xmath7 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath213 vanishes in the early times ( @xmath214 which corresponds to @xmath215 ) , and goes to @xmath216 in the late times except for the case @xmath194 .",
    "the evolution of the deceleration parameter ( [ qi ] ) is presented in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "an interesting result is that , the value of the deceleration parameter for the models with @xmath194 is running when @xmath217 .",
    "the curve corresponding to @xmath194 , is sensitive to negative values of @xmath7 .",
    "plots show that there is a transition between the value @xmath218 and negative values of @xmath26 .",
    "this transition for @xmath194 is relatively slower than for the other value of @xmath5 ; the larger values the parameter @xmath7 gets , the later the transition occurs .",
    "in addition to the mentioned effect of negative values of @xmath7 for curves with @xmath194 , the overall effects of the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath199 can be distinguished . to this end ,",
    "the present values of the deceleration function @xmath28 in fig .",

    "left corner diagram with lower left one in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , shows that the net effect of @xmath219 is to decrease the values of @xmath28 .",
    "since there is a linear relation between the deceleration and eos parameters , there exists a similar mutual behavior for the effect of @xmath7 when @xmath208 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we present the evolution of the statefinder parameters in the @xmath220 plane for @xmath221 . in this plane , the values of @xmath3 are mapped on a horizontal axis and a vertical axis determines the values of @xmath4 . in the upper left panel ,",
    "we plot the diagrams that hold for gr , in order to see possible deviations . in each panel besides the present values ( which are indicated by small solid circle ) , we represent starting point with a star symbol ( corresponding to a point in the early times ) , the position of the @xmath10cdm model ( corresponding to future ) with a solid small box and the direction of the evolution of the trajectories with colored arrows .",
    "the starting point corresponding to the early times is obtained by the condition @xmath222 . in the limit @xmath222",

    "[ fig2 ] , shows that for a specific value of @xmath5 , the net effect of negative values of @xmath7 is an increase in the value of @xmath32 , and a decrease in the value of @xmath33 .",
    "a columnar view shows that negative values of @xmath199 would increase the value of @xmath32 .",

    "besides the model coupling constants @xmath241 and parameter @xmath5 , there is another parameter , @xmath6 , as the forth constant .",
    "therefore , the net effects of this parameter should be considered .",
    "the related figures of the effective eos parameter @xmath164 for this model are illustrated in fig .",

    "hence , in this case the diagrams for @xmath207 and @xmath26 are not redrawn in model(s ) ii ( and iii in the later subsection ) .",
    "we arrange the diagrams the same as model i , however in this case the parameter @xmath6 increases horizontally .",
    "an increase in the value of @xmath6 leads to a decrease in the value of @xmath192 , and this is clearly evident for the relatively smaller values of @xmath5 . in this model",
    "we obtain more acceptable results in all range @xmath245 ; upper left diagram shows that even for @xmath246 we have @xmath247 ( red dot - dashed line ) , the result that met in model i only for @xmath248 . by comparing the effective eos diagrams between model i and ii",
    "we see that the value of @xmath192 decreases when the value of @xmath6 increases , and this means that we can construct more acceptable models for larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "in fig  [ fig6 ] we have depicted ( @xmath235 ) plane diagrams for different values @xmath262 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "these diagrams have been arranged in such a way that the parameter @xmath6 varies in the horizontal view and the coupling constants @xmath241 in the vertical view .",
    "comparison of the lateral diagrams shows that in the high pressure regime a growth in the value of @xmath6 would result in a decrease in the value of @xmath32 and increases the value of @xmath33 for @xmath255 .",
    "however , when @xmath265 this feature can not be seen for large values of @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the distance to the @xmath13 fixed point becomes so long when @xmath6 approaches to @xmath140 and @xmath266 gets away from @xmath140 .",
    "that is , the models with large values of @xmath6 and small values of @xmath5 are distinguishable from the @xmath13 model in the high pressure regime .",
    "however , since the @xmath13 is the mostly accepted cosmological model , these models can not be very interesting .",
    "the upper left panel holds for gr regime which resembles the @xmath13 model , since , we have @xmath267 and @xmath268 . in the vertical view , we see that decreasing the values of @xmath7 does not lead to a significant variations of the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath32 . therefore , decreasing in the value of @xmath7 does not affect the distance of underlying model . furthermore",
    ", when @xmath260 decreases , the present fixed point @xmath269 gets farther from the @xmath13 one only for large values of @xmath6 and small values of @xmath5 .",
    "when parameter @xmath7 is switched on , an increase in the values of @xmath273 and @xmath28 would happen .",
    "such an effect appears in model ii , as well . since , when @xmath8s@xmath180 , we have the same values of @xmath273 and @xmath28 for the three models , therefore to understand the effect of decreasing the value of @xmath278 from zero to an arbitrary negative value ( here @xmath216 ) , one can compare the diagrams of fig .

    "thus , again decreasing @xmath278 to negative values can help to construct more reliable models with admissible values of @xmath273 and @xmath28 . in figure  [ fig9 ] we present the related diagrams for the statefinder parameters of model iii .",
    "these diagrams are plotted for @xmath277 , since the diagrams for @xmath279 are the same as the diagrams for model ii with @xmath255 . comparing the plots of fig .",

    "as diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] show , an increase in the value of @xmath6 , decreases the value of @xmath32 and makes @xmath33 to get larger values . the overal behavior of this , is to lengthen the distance to the @xmath10cdm fixed point .",
    "nevertheless , the effect is weak for larger values of @xmath5 .",
    "a vertical view indicates that decreasing the parameter @xmath7 , has no remarkable effect on the present values of the statefinder parameters , though it leads the distance to become slightly shorter for larger values of @xmath6 and smaller value of @xmath5 .",

    "we have obtained three different forms for @xmath0 function based on the emt conservation and subsequently the cosmological consequences of these models have been extracted from a theoretical point of view . in this section , these solutions will be compared to snia cosmological data and the compilation of hubble parameter measurements .",
    "supernovae type ia as accurate standard candles are the most direct probe to detect signatures of the accelerated expansion of the universe as well as de .",
    "therefore , dark energy scenarios in the first step can be examined by comparing their predicted luminosity distance to the observational data . in this regard ,",
    "we apply the chi - square test of the goodness of fit of the hubble parameter and modulus distance quantity defined by equations ( [ ei])-([eiii ] ) for models i , ii and iii to the observational data .",
    "the procedure of fitting can be summarized as follows : the supernova observations include @xmath200 apparent magnitude @xmath280 which can be translated to a quantity which is called  distance modulus @xmath281 \" , the corresponding redshift @xmath282 and their errors .",

    "for example , we have @xmath287 in this paper .",
    "the idea is to find the best fit values of the model parameters which lead to the most consistency between the predicted curves of the modulus distance as well as the hubble parameter ( by the virtue of the underlying theoretical model ) and the observational data .",

    "all trajectories start from @xmath342 in the @xmath220 plane .",
    "the distance to the @xmath10cdm model is weakly affected by variation of the value @xmath6 when @xmath343 . for @xmath344 ,",
    "the trajectories are the same as those models of class ii and belong to categories ( i ) and ( iii ) .",
    "finally , we have employed the chi - square test to examine models i , ii and iii using recent observational data .",
    "specifically , the union 2 sample including 557 snia data and 28 hubble parameter measurements have been used and the best fit values of the model parameters by minimizing the so called chi - square function ( it can be accounted for as the function of all model parameters ) have been obtained .",
    "we found that in models i and ii , the behavior of the modulus distance , the hubble parameter and the effective eos parameter are consistent with the observations for those best fit parameters which minimize the modulus distance chi - square . in this case we have obtained @xmath345 and @xmath346 which show admissible values .",
    "the best fit parameters gained from the hubble parameter chi - square test lead to a non - compatible value for the present effective eos parameter and also in this case the theoretical curve of modulus distance does not match the observational data in both models i and ii . we compared the values of statefinder parameters which are predicted by these three models by the observational data .",
    "it is shown that the results from the observational constraints on the statefinder parameters are in favor of model ii .",
    "we came to conclusion that the results of performed studies in this work , for @xmath0 gravity with gcg in high pressure regimes can be reassuring enough to merit further investigations .",

    "<S> in this paper , we investigate cosmological consequences of a scenario for recently reported accelerated expansion of the universe , in which the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) along with the baryonic matter are responsible for this observed phenomenon . in the present model </S>",
    "<S> , we employ an isotropic and homogeneous flrw space time in the framework of @xmath0 theory of gravity . in @xmath0 gravity </S>",
    "<S> , the conservation of energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) leads to a constraint equation which enforces us to use some specific forms of type @xmath1 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three classes of chaplygin gas models which include three different forms of @xmath0 function ; those models which employ the standard chaplygin gas ( scg ) , models which use gcg in the high pressure regimes and finally , the third case is devoted to investigating high density regimes in the presence of gcg . </S>",
    "<S> the effective equation of state ( eos ) and the deceleration parameter for these chaplygin gas models are calculated and it is indicated that the related present values can be observationally acceptable in @xmath0 gravity . among the models we shall present , type two models has a better situation ; the predictions of these models are more consistent with the observational data . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine these models via the statefinder diagnostic tool . </S>",
    "<S> the statefinder parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are obtained for these three scenarios and various trajectories are plotted for different values of the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the involved parameters are , @xmath5 and @xmath6 which appear in the gcg density and the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 which are related to the integral constants which are appeared in the process of obtaining @xmath9 . the discrimination between different dark energy models is considered by varying the mentioned parameters for these three types of models . since positive values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 s would lead to some divergences , we will take negative values . </S>",
    "<S> it is discussed that the consistent values for the effective eos for all allowed values of @xmath5 , can only be obtained in the high pressure regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the distance of these models ( which is defined as the difference between the predicted present values of the statefinder parameters of a model and the corresponding ones for @xmath10cdm model ) , varies for different choices of the model parameters . however </S>",
    "<S> , the distance does not depend on the values of @xmath6 for models of type three . finally , we test these chaplygin gas models using recent hubble parameter as well as type ia supernova data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these models are compatible with type ia supernova data . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , we plot the modulus distance , the hubble parameter and the effective eos parameter for the best fit values of the model(s ) parameters . also , we compare the predicted present values of the statefinder parameters to the observational data . </S>"
