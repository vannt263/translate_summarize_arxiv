    "many larger and more ambitious surveys are ongoing , planned or proposed .",

    "a major challenge for the future of wl studies is to have a very tight control of systematic errors .",
    "these include incomplete knowledge of the source redshift distribution .",
    "recent cosmic shear studies have obtained their redshift distributions from joint redshift - magnitude distributions measured in independent surveys @xcite ; from photometric redshifts ( `` photo-@xmath4 s '' ) @xcite ; or some combination . the former approach suffers from the difficulty that the selection function ( and relative weighting ) of galaxies may be different in the lensing and redshift surveys , while the latter approach suffers from possible photo-@xmath4 errors that are difficult to constrain in the absence of spectroscopic confirmation , especially if only a small number of colors are measured .",
    "several studies have marginalized over the source redshift distribution .",
    "ultimately the most robust and model - independent determination of the source redshift distribution would be via spectroscopy of a randomly chosen sub - sample of the source catalog .",
    "however , spectroscopy of faint galaxies can be very time - consuming even with today s large - aperture telescopes . in this paper",
    ", we forecast fisher - matrix constraints from cosmic shear using a spectroscopically determined redshift distribution , varying the number of spectra @xmath0 obtained .",
    "the source redshift distribution is expanded in a fourier series , and the amplitudes of each mode are considered as parameters to be constrained via both the spectroscopic and wl data .",
    "we address the effect of galaxy clustering on our analysis and discuss the effect of a better calibration .",
    "the following basic parameter set for wl is considered : @xmath5 , the physical matter density ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively the fraction of the critical density in a dark energy component and its equation of state ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the spectral index and running of the primordial scalar power spectrum at @xmath10 ; @xmath11 , the amplitude of linear fluctuations ; @xmath12 , the leading coefficients of a fourier expansion of the source galaxy redshift distribution ( see eq . [ eq : z_dist_expansion ] in the see next section ) ; in the case of two bin tomography we use @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "we also include @xmath15 and @xmath16 as defined in @xcite to parametrize the shear calibration bias , in which the gravitational shear is systematically over- or under - estimated by a multiplicative factor , _",

    "@xmath15 refers to the calibration error of the power spectrum , which is twice the calibration error of the amplitude as the power spectrum is proportional to amplitude squared .",

    "this error affects the measured power spectrum @xmath19 in accordance with : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the fraction of the source galaxies in bin a and b respectively .    in order to combine this with information from the cmb we include @xmath23 , the physical baryon density ; @xmath24 , the optical depth to reionization ; and @xmath25 , the tensor - to - scalar fluctuation ratio .",

    "the spectroscopy fisher matrix is obtained as follows .",
    "if a galaxy is chosen at random from the lensing catalog , and is spectroscopically determined to have redshift @xmath4 , then the log - likelihood for the redshift distribution parameters @xmath62 is @xmath91 .",

    "it is possible to take different numbers of spectra in the two bins ; we have not attempted any optimization of this .",
    "we consider the cases of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "the results can be compared to the case where the source redshift distribution is known exactly by taking the limit @xmath104 .",
    "the fisher matrix is an asymptotic expansion , and while it is the standard tool of parameter forecasting , it sometimes leads to over - optimistic parameter constraints ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extreme example ) .",
    "we have not tested its validity when used with this many parameters , although this could be done by monte carlo methods as used by ref .",
    "in the discussion above , it has been assumed that the spectroscopically obtained @xmath105 is on average the same as the redshift distribution @xmath105 of the sources used for lensing , and that the redshifts of the galaxies targeted for spectroscopy are independent .",
    "these assumptions will be literally true in the idealized case that the spectroscopic galaxies are chosen independently from the lensing source catalog , and there are no failures to obtain spectro-@xmath4 s . in practice",
    ", spectro-@xmath4s would probably be obtained by a multi - object spectrograph attached to a large telescope .",
    "the spectro-@xmath4 failure rate will be minimized by using the longest practical integration time to maximize signal - to - noise for each spectrum , and the demands on telescope time are thus reduced if multiple objects in the same field of view can be targeted simultaneously .",
    "however in this case the galaxies are not being drawn independently from the source catalog , in particular large - scale clustering can cause the redshifts of neighboring source galaxies to become correlated . the feasibility of obtaining many independent spectro-@xmath4 s is directly tied to the clustering of the sources and the field of view of the telescope since these determine the maximum number of galaxies that can be simultaneously targeted for spectroscopy without the results being strongly correlated .",
    "the effect of source clustering can be understood within the context of fisher matrix theory as follows .",
    "if the fiducial model is correct , and the analysis is done assuming that the spectro-@xmath4s are independent , the difference @xmath106 between the estimated and fiducial model parameters is roughly @xmath107^{\\alpha\\beta } \\left.{\\partial\\ln{\\cal l}\\over \\partial p^\\beta}\\right|_{\\rm fid } , \\label{eq : dpa}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the likelihood assuming independent spectro-@xmath4s ( i.e. the sum of eq .",
    "[ eq : lqj ] over the spectroscopic targets ) , @xmath109 is the fisher matrix ( also assuming independent spectro-@xmath4s ) , and the gradient is taken at the fiducial model .",
    "so long as each galaxy in the lensing source catalog has an equal probability of being targeted for spectroscopy , it is easy to see that the spectroscopy contribution to @xmath110 and hence @xmath111 , i.e. the inclusion of the spectroscopy likelihood function introduces no bias in the parameters even if the spectroscopic galaxies are not chosen independently .",
    "however , the clustering of the sources does increase the covariance matrix of the @xmath112 ; taking the covariance of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dpa ] ) gives @xmath113^{\\alpha\\gamma}[{\\bf f}^{-1}]^{\\beta\\delta } \\left\\langle { \\partial\\ln{\\cal l}\\over \\partial p^\\gamma } { \\partial\\ln{\\cal l}\\over \\partial p^\\delta } \\right\\rangle_{\\rm fid } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & [ { \\bf f}^{-1}]^{\\alpha\\gamma}[{\\bf f}^{-1}]^{\\beta\\delta } \\bigl\\ { [ { \\bf f}_{cmb}+{\\bf f}_{wl } + \\pi]_{\\gamma\\delta } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\delta_\\gamma^{q_j}\\delta_\\delta^{q_k } \\sum_{a , b=1}^{n_{spec } } \\frac { \\langle\\cos(j\\pi p_0(z_a))\\cos(k\\pi",

    "( [ eq : pvar ] ) , the last term in @xmath115 would simply be the spectroscopy fisher matrix for independent spectro-@xmath4s , @xmath116 .",
    "the @xmath117 terms are only non - zero due to correlations of the galaxies with each other , and they contribute to quantity in @xmath115 by an amount @xmath118 . since the probability of two galaxies separated by angle @xmath119 being physically associated with each other is @xmath120 $ ] , where @xmath121 is the angular correlation function , and the cosine is bounded in the range @xmath122 to @xmath123 , it follows that the @xmath117 contribution is @xmath124 as compared with @xmath125 .",
    "therefore if @xmath126 , then the clustering contribution @xmath127 will be small compared to the spectroscopy fisher matrix @xmath116 and hence will contribute negligibly to the parameter uncertainties according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pvar ] ) .",
    "let us consider the implications of this result for an idealized spectroscopic survey strategy that consists of observing @xmath128 widely separated fields , and obtaining @xmath129 spectra in each field .",
    "we suppose the telescope has a circular field of view of angular radius @xmath130 , that the number density of galaxies targeted for selection in each field is @xmath131 , and that the angular correlation function is @xmath132 .",
    "we then have @xmath133 where the integrals are taken over a circular disk of radius @xmath130 .",
    "( the replacement of the galaxy - galaxy pair summation by an integral is appropriate because the integral is convergent at small separation @xmath134 . )",
    "the factor of @xmath128 in the first line occurs because we have to repeat the sum for each of the @xmath128 fields . in order to have @xmath126 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wsum ] ) tells us that we need a number of fields given by @xmath135 not surprisingly , the number of fields that need to be observed depends on the ratio of the field - of - view radius @xmath130 to the angular clustering scale @xmath136 .",
    "an angular clustering scale of @xmath137  degrees is observed in sdss @xcite for the magnitude range @xmath138 ( valid at separations of 130  arcmin ) .",
    "even smaller @xmath136 applies to fainter samples , e.g. the cfdf survey finds @xmath139 for @xmath140 galaxies , corresponding to @xmath141  degrees ( for slope @xmath142 , which is consistent with the @xmath143 data from @xmath144 to several arcminutes ) .",
    "the fainter cfdf sample is probably more representative of the galaxies that will be used in future wl surveys . for @xmath145 and a field of view of 0.5 degree radius ,",
    "we find from eq .",
    "( [ eq : jreq ] ) the requirement @xmath146 ( @xmath147  deg ) or @xmath148 ( @xmath149  deg ) . in either case",
    "the number of fields that must be observed to achieve @xmath145 ranges from a few to a few dozen , and for @xmath150 we find that the minimum number of fields @xmath128 is a few dozen to a few hundred .",
    "the number of spectra to be obtained per field is @xmath151 .",
    "the problem of spectro-@xmath4 failures is more difficult to assess than the source clustering . in order to accurately reproduce the @xmath105 of the lensing source catalog , the targets in the associated spectroscopic survey",
    "must be selected randomly from the lensing catalog , or at least have the same selection criteria .",
    "spectro-@xmath4 failures are not part of the lensing catalog selection criteria , and hence can bias the @xmath105 determination .",
    "the spectro-@xmath4 failure rate can be reduced by using large - aperture telescopes and very long integration times , which may prove feasible if @xmath130 is large , @xmath136 is small , and hence the number of fields @xmath128 to be observed is only a few .",
    "it may also be possible to reduce failures by imposing appropriate color cuts on the source sample .",
    "nevertheless , the failure rate will never be exactly zero .",
    "the treatment of systematic errors in @xmath105 due to these failures is beyond the scope of this paper , but clearly deserves consideration in future work .",

    "as expected , we find that combination of constraints from wl and from cmb leads to significant improvements in parameter estimation , notably for @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath155 .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : notomo ] , the increase of the number of expansion terms from @xmath156 to 100 has little effect on this result .",
    "this suggests that the parameter estimates have converged and , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_dist_expansion ] ) can model an arbitrary function for sufficiently large @xmath157 , it suggests that the form ( eq .  [ eq : z_dist_expansion ] ) for the redshift distribution is not artificially constraining the cosmological parameters .",
    "in agreement with previous results , we find that the addition of redshift information is helpful for several of the cosmological parameters such as @xmath155 , @xmath152 , @xmath154 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the optical depth @xmath24 is less improved by lensing because most of the statistical power on @xmath24 is coming from the cmb polarization reionization peak , which is not degenerate with any lensing - related quantities .",
    "the baryon density is well - constrained by the cmb , however by improving our constraints on several cosmological parameters , lensing information breaks the relatively weak remaining degeneracies in the cmb and reduces the error from @xmath158 to @xmath159 .",
    "even lensing with @xmath100 is sufficient to break this degeneracy , so inclusion of redshift information adds little for @xmath160 .",
    "the addition of redshift information leads to further significant improvements in the parameter estimation as expected .",
    "the @xmath100 constraints are substantially worse than @xmath161 , because in the @xmath100 case even wildly oscillating redshift distributions @xmath105 are formally allowed , as is evidenced by the large @xmath162 in table  [ tab : notomo ] .",
    "although the gradual addition of spectroscopic redshifts does make additional improvements on the constraints on the cosmological parameters , we find that there is a certain number of @xmath0 ( several thousands for the surveys considered here ) beyond which the addition of further spectra will make only a very small improvement to the cosmological parameters .    in order to try to explain this ,",
    "let us recall that error bars are correlated , and hence there can still be combinations of parameters that are degraded by incomplete knowledge of the source redshift distribution .",
    "information on this degradation is contained within the @xmath163 covariance matrix @xmath164 of the cosmological parameters @xmath165 .",
    "we examine the degradation factor @xmath166 of the combination of parameters @xmath167 given by @xmath168^{\\alpha\\beta}k_\\alpha k_\\beta } { [ \\textbf{c}(\\infty)]^{\\alpha\\beta}k_\\alpha k_\\beta}.\\ ] ] the maximum value of @xmath166 can be found by setting @xmath169 , which leads to the eigenvalue equation @xmath170^{\\alpha\\beta}k_\\alpha k_\\beta } { [ \\textbf{c}(\\infty)]^{\\alpha\\beta}k_\\alpha k_\\beta}k_\\gamma = [ \\textbf{c}^{-1 } ( \\infty)]_{\\gamma\\beta } [ \\textbf{c}(n_{spec } )   ] ^{\\beta\\alpha}k_\\alpha.\\ ] ] thus the @xmath171 that maximizes the degradation @xmath172 is an eigenvector of @xmath173 $ ] , and the degradation factor @xmath172 is the eigenvalue .",

    "this is because @xmath179 is a direction in parameter space that is very well - constrained by wl+cmb : with cmb only , we have @xmath182 , whereas with wl and @xmath145 added to the cmb we have @xmath183 and correlation coefficient @xmath184 . consequently , although @xmath179 is degraded by imperfect knowledge of the source redshift distribution , and is degenerate with the redshift distribution parameters , it is not the direction that dominates the uncertainties on the individual cosmological parameters .",
    "the second - largest eigenvalue of @xmath174 $ ] is 1.2 , indicating that the directions other than @xmath179 are not significantly degraded .",
    "when we fix the calibration parameters , the eigenvector analysis shows an increase of almost an order of magnitude on the degradation with @xmath185 , but again , not in the direction that dominates the uncertainties on the conventional cosmological parameters . as seen from table [ tab : notomo ] and table [ tab : tomo ] , a better calibration will make a larger numbers of spectra slightly more useful but a significant improvement require a rather idealized perfect knowledge of the calibration .",
    "the most significant improvement in the cosmological parameters with large numbers of spectra comes from the cases with tomography , since this helps break the degeneracies that dominate the parameter uncertainties and allows the directions well constrained by wl to become more important .",
    "one can see from table  [ tab : tomo ] that the uncertainties on @xmath6 , @xmath152 , and @xmath7 are degraded by @xmath186 for @xmath150 versus @xmath187 with the larger area @xmath175 .",
    "in all the other cases the degradation with @xmath150 is much less .",
    "it is possible that different results would be obtained if wl were combined with additional cosmological probes such as supernovae , which could break remaining degeneracies in the data and therefore make the degradation of @xmath179 more important .",
    "a general way to investigate this possibility is to examine @xmath188 for the wl - only matrices , since combining wl with cosmological probes that do not include the @xmath58 must result in a degradation factor @xmath188 smaller than that for wl alone .",
    "when we apply the eigenvalue analysis to the weak lensing only matrices , we obtain the degradation factors of @xmath189 for the fixed calibration case and @xmath145 .",
    "the latter number indicates that there are directions in cosmological parameter space which are dramatically improved by exact knowledge of the redshift distribution rather than only 512 spectra .",
    "we can reduce the degradation factor to @xmath190 by increasing @xmath0 to 200000 , and it is thus only for @xmath191 that _ every _ direction in parameter space is limited by lensing statistics rather than redshift distribution uncertainties .",
    "however , this improvement is rapidly lost due to the approximate calibration - redshift degeneracy if the calibration is uncertain : if the prior on the calibration parameters is widened to @xmath192 we achieve @xmath190 at @xmath193 , and with @xmath194 we achieve @xmath190 at @xmath195 . thus having either good calibration or a well - determined redshift distribution individually",
    "may not be very useful , but having both combined can significantly improve some constraints .",
    "we conclude that , though significant improvement is obtained from the addition of redshifts information , there is a certain number of @xmath0  of order @xmath196 for the surveys considered here  beyond which the addition of further spectra will make only a very small improvement to the cosmological parameters .",
    "we do find that there are directions in parameter space that continue to improve and do not saturate until @xmath0 is very large , especially if the calibration is very well determined ; however these directions correspond to very large eigenvalues of the wl fisher matrix and do not dominate the parameter uncertainties in the wl+cmb combinations we have discussed .",
    "the results presented here indicate that if @xmath2few@xmath3 spectra of representative sources can be obtained , cosmological constraints can potentially be improved relative to the cmb - only case without model - dependent assumptions about the source redshift distribution .",
    "these results are robust against fluctuations in the spectro-@xmath4 distribution due to galaxy clustering so long as enough spectroscopic fields are observed , as detailed in sec .",
