    "optical clocks in general and lattice clocks in particular have shown outstanding fractional frequency instabilities of about @xmath3 @xcite , averaging down to the low @xmath4-regime .",
    "this development has been made possible mainly by significant improvements on the frequency stability of the interrogation lasers @xcite .",
    "the improvement of clock stability has a strong impact on the determination of the clock s accuracy since systematic frequency shifts can be evaluated with higher accuracy in reasonable time .",
    "furthermore , the stability of a clock also determines how practical it is for actual measurements and if , e.g. , temporal variations of signals @xcite can be observed .",
    "the instability of a clock stems from different sources of noise contributing to the error signal detected in the clock cycle , i.e.  the estimated frequency offset of the clock laser from the atomic transition , and from the dick effect @xcite due to the non - continuous interrogation of the atoms by the clock laser @xcite .",
    "the dick effect originates mostly from the unobserved clock laser fluctuations during the dead - time of the clock cycle .    in high - performance clocks",
    "the reference transition is coherently interrogated by either rabi or ramsey schemes on a frequency - sensitive slope of the spectroscopic signal . in the detection , the quantum superposition state of each individual atom",
    "is projected to the ground or excited state , leading to the fundamental noise limit given by the quantum projection noise ( qpn ) @xcite .",
    "an increase of atom number @xmath5 will reduce the influence of the projection noise as it scales with @xmath6 while the signal scales with @xmath5 .",
    "however , in practice the atom number is limited by other factors as , e.g. , collision shifts @xcite .",
    "ideally , the qpn should be the dominant noise contribution in the measurement of the frequency offset of the local oscillator from the atomic line .",
    "squeezed states @xcite and entanglement of the atoms @xcite can overcome the projection noise limit .",
    "it must , however , be noted that at present even the most stable optical clocks are still limited by the aliasing of laser noise , i.e. , via the dick effect .    with this background",
    "it becomes obvious that a detailed understanding of the noise sources present in the experiment is not only essential for optimizing the clock stability and interrogation strategy , but also for judging the necessity to implement squeezing and entanglement methods to improve the clock .",
    "we therefore give a rigorous analysis of the detection noise contributions in our sr lattice clock @xcite ( sec .",
    "[ sec : noise ] ) .",
    "the noise model is further supplemented by a contribution of the clock laser noise @xcite via the dick effect ( sec .",
    "[ sec : laser ] ) . combining both",
    ", we show that the clock instability observed during evaluations of systematic effects in interleaved stabilization mode is well reproduced and a clock instability of @xmath1 can be inferred for regular clock operation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : stability ] ) , which is governed by the excellent stability of our clock laser @xcite and competitive with the best values of @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite published to date .",
    "in this section , the individual noise contributions affecting the measured excitation probability are discussed . in the final part of the section ,",
    "their influence on the clock signal is modeled and compared with experimental observations . for the sake of simplicity , we express all noise amplitudes in arbitrary units of the data acquisition system labeled ` counts ' .    figure  [ fig : scheme ] shows a simplified level scheme of the strontium atom .",
    "details for laser cooling and trapping of strontium atoms have been described in previous publications @xcite . to derive the spectroscopic signal of the lattice clock after the interrogation of the @xmath9sr atoms by the clock laser , atoms in the ground state ( @xmath10 )",
    "are excited with a resonant laser beam in standing - wave configuration on the strong 461  nm cooling transition , @xmath11 .",
    "the fluorescence is observed by a photomultiplier tube in current mode .",
    "its signal is amplified and digitized with an analog - to - digital converter of the data acquisition computer .",
    "this signal @xmath12 is , apart from an offset @xmath13 , proportional to the @xmath10 ground state atom number .",
    "the radiation pressure removes the atoms from the detection volume within 20  ms .",
    "similarly , the signal @xmath14 from atoms in the excited clock state ( @xmath15 ) is detected after the atoms have been optically pumped within few 100  @xmath16s to the @xmath17 state by two lasers resonant with the @xmath18 and @xmath19 transitions , from where they decay further to the ground state .",
    "in addition , the offset @xmath13 in both @xmath12 and @xmath14 due to stray light , multiplier dark current , and electronic offset is measured via a third and final detection pulse after removing any remaining atoms .",
    "therefore , each of the signals @xmath12 , @xmath14 , and @xmath13 is a sum of different contributions from fluorescence ( @xmath20 ) , stray light ( @xmath21 ) , and electronic background ( @xmath22 ) . from these three signals ,",
    "the atomic excitation probability @xmath23 is estimated by @xmath24 this normalization removes substantial noise on @xmath12 and @xmath14 due to shot - to - shot fluctuations of the atom number @xmath5 . here , we replaced the measured offset @xmath13 by its running average @xmath25 , since the variation of the actual background is small on timescales of several interrogation cycles ; thus the additional noise of @xmath23 due to the shot - to - shot noise of the offset measurement is suppressed and does not need to be considered in the noise model .",
    "the connection between the excitation probability , in particular its noise , and the corresponding frequency excursion of the interrogation laser is given by the slope of the spectroscopic signal .",
    "for the case of probing the atomic resonance line at a half - width point @xcite using rabi interrogation with a pulse of length @xmath26 , the slope is @xmath27 with its sign depending on which side of the resonance is probed . a ramsey interrogation scheme with a free precession time @xmath28 and short excitation pulses leads to a steeper slope of @xmath29      the electronic noise was measured by running the standard detection sequence without atoms or laser light being present .",
    "the observed noise is a sum of amplifier , digitizer , and dark current noise .",
    "such noise will be present in the three signals , @xmath12 , @xmath14 , and @xmath13 , but not in @xmath25 .",
    "the standard deviation of the signal is @xmath30  counts , while the amplitude of the electronic offset signal @xmath31  counts .      during the detection of the atomic fluorescence ,",
    "a finite number of photons is collected by the photomultiplier tube .",
    "thus , the signals @xmath12 and @xmath14 will suffer from a shot noise contribution . in order to quantify this contribution , we have investigated the photon shot noise using a flashlight as a shot noise  limited light source . for the observed white phase noise , the first point of the allan deviation of the recorded data is equal to their standard deviation ; we use this value as a measure of the noise to remove the influence of slow intensity variations of the flashlight .",
    "the measurements were performed for different signal amplitudes .",
    "the electronic background @xmath22 ( discussed in the previous subsection ) must be removed to extract the actual ` fluorescence ' signal @xmath20 , i.e.  the signal stemming only from detected photons . the resulting ` fluorescence ' noise contribution @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shotnoise ] .",
    "the expected @xmath33-dependence of the noise amplitude @xmath32 is well reproduced . from a fit we find @xmath34 which corresponds to @xmath20 = 0.35(3 ) counts per detected photon .",
    "fluorescence shot noise will be present in the signals @xmath12 and @xmath14 with an amplitude depending on the fluorescence contribution @xmath20 to these signals , as e.g.  the electronic offset @xmath22 is not subject to shot noise .",

    "[ eq : sn ] ( solid line).,width=8 ]      intensity fluctuations of the detection laser at the position of the atoms will show up on the fluorescence signal as long as the transition is not strongly saturated .",
    "we avoid high intensity , since the radiation pressure  induced heating of the atoms reduces the reasonable interaction time and thus the detected signal .",
    "this loss of signal is not compensated by the higher photon scattering rate , and the detection would be less efficient .",
    "intensity fluctuations may arise from both power and pointing instability of the detection laser .",
    "we measured the power fluctuations of the laser in a similar procedure as for the shot noise measurements , except that we used stray light from the detection laser instead of a flashlight . from these measurements",
    "we have found data that is very similar to the one presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : shotnoise ] . in particular ,",
    "we have observed no significant noise contribution with a linear dependence on laser power and thus conclude that laser power noise on short time scales , which would result in such a contribution , can be neglected .",
    "this is corroborated further by direct measurements of the laser power .",
    "the optical setup of the detection beam , which is delivered by a fiber and collimated to a diameter of about 2  mm , comprises only a short free - space path on the order of 50  cm ; we have analyzed its pointing instability and found it to be negligible on relevant time scales .",
    "we also note that the shot noise of the detection beam with a power of about 400  @xmath16w is negligible .",
    "laser stray light ( @xmath21 ) adds a shot - noise contribution to the signals @xmath12 and @xmath14 according to eq .",

    "it depends on the atom number @xmath5 and the excitation probability @xmath23 @xcite as @xmath38 the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath39 can thus be improved by increasing the atom number .",
    "@xmath5 is proportional to @xmath36 , where the constant of proportionality to convert from ` counts ' to atom number is about one atom per count .",
    "this factor depends on the actual alignment of the experiment , the frequency and power of the detection laser , and other parameters .",
    "we measured the noise @xmath40 of the excitation probability of samples of atoms with @xmath35 and different atom numbers @xmath5 to investigate whether we can achieve qpn - limited detection in our experiment . in order to become insusceptible to frequency noise of the interrogation laser , we prepared a coherent superposition state by using a resonant @xmath37-rabi pulse instead of rabi excitation with a @xmath41-pulse at a half - width frequency detuning as usually applied in a stabilization sequence .",
    "a pulse length of @xmath42  ms was chosen .",

    "we conclude that detection is limited by qpn for more than 200  counts , or 130  atoms . for 300  atoms",

    "finally , the duty cycle of clock laser interrogation could be increased : nondestructive detection methods @xcite , which use , e.g. , the phase - shift imprinted onto an off - resonant detection beam , allow keeping the majority of cold atoms in the lattice and thus reduce the required preparation time .",
