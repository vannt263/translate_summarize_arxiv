    "fractional calculus is the generalization of classical calculus and with a history parallel to that of classical calculus .",
    "it was studied by many of the same mathematicians who contributed significantly to the development of classical calculus . in recent years , it has seen a growing use as an appropriate model for non classic phenomena in physical , engineering , and biology fields @xcite .    to gain an understanding of the basic elements of fractional calculus , we recall @xmath8 a slight rewriting yields @xmath9 clearly , eq . ( [ deffracint2 ] ) still formally makes sense if @xmath10 is replaced by @xmath4 ( @xmath11 ) leading to the definition of the fractional integral as @xmath12 here @xmath13 .",
    "this definition of the fractional integral is natural and simple , and inherits many good mathematical properties , e.g. , the semigroup property .",
    "moreover @xmath14 ` connects ' @xmath15 to @xmath16 in a natural way .    with the derivative as the inverse operation of the integral",
    ", the definition of the fractional derivative naturally arises by combining the definitions of the classical derivative and the fractional integral . in this way",
    ", the fractional derivative operator @xmath17 can be defined as @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "mathematically , the first one can be regarded as preferred since @xmath20 while @xmath21 , which involves additional information about the function at the left end point .",
    "when considering a fractional derivative in the temporal direction , the second formulation is more popular due to its convenience when specifying the initial condition in a classic sense .",
    "these two definitions of derivatives are referred to as the riemann - liouville derivative and caputo derivative @xcite , respectively , with the riemann - liouville derivative being defined as @xcite @xmath22 and the caputo derivative recovered as @xmath23 a third alternative definition is the grnwald - letnikov derivative , based on finite differences to generalize the classical derivative .",
    "this is equivalent to the riemann - liouville derivative if one ignores assumptions on the regularity of the functions .    for ( [ rlderi ] ) ,",
    "the following holds @xcite @xmath24 and for ( [ deffracint3 ] ) , @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the operator @xmath26 makes sense and ` connects ' the orders of the fractional derivative from @xmath15 to @xmath27 .",
    "however , for ( [ cderi ] ) , one recovers @xmath28 the riemann - liouville derivative and the caputo derivative are equivalent if @xmath29 is sufficiently smooth and satisfies @xmath30    in this work , we develop a local discontinuous galerkin ( ldg ) methods for the one - term and multi - term initial value problems for fractional ordinary differential equations ( fodes ) . for ease of presentation , we shall focus the discussion on the following two types of fodes @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 $ ] , and @xmath6 is a positive integer and also include examples of @xmath34 $ ] in the interest of generalization . for ( [ firstclass ] ) and ( [ secondclass ] ) , the initial conditions can be specified exactly as for the classical odes , i.e. , the values of @xmath35 must be given , where @xmath36 for ( [ firstclass ] ) and @xmath37 for ( [ secondclass ] ) .",
    "it appears that the earliest numerical methods used in the engineering community for such problems are the predictor - corrector approach originally presented in @xcite , later slightly improved in @xcite , and a method using a series of classical derivatives to approximate the fractional derivative , realized by using frequency domain techniques based on bode diagrams @xcite . for the second method , ways to evaluate the time domain error introduced in the frequency domain approximations",
    "remains open .",
    "the discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods have been well developed to solve classical differential equations @xcite , initiated for the classical odes @xcite with substantial later work , mostly related to discontinuous galerkin methods for the related volterra integro - differential equation , including a priori analysis @xcite , @xmath38-adaptive methods @xcite and recent work on super convergence in the @xmath39-version @xcite .",
    "this has been extended to approximate the fractional spatial derivatives @xcite to solve fractional diffusion equation by using the idea of local discontinuous galerkin ( ldg ) methods @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we discuss dg methods to allow for the approximate solution of general fodes . all the advantages / characteristics of the spatial dg methods carries over to this case with a central one being the ability to solve the equation interval by interval when the upwind flux , taking the value of @xmath29 at a discontinuity point @xmath40 as @xmath41 , is used .",
    "however , this is a natural choice , since for the initial value problems for the fractional ( or classical ) odes , the information travels forward in time .",
    "this implies that we just invert a local low order matrix rather than a global _ full _ matrix .",
    "the ldg methods for the first order fodes ( [ firstclass ] ) have optimal order of convergence @xmath0 in the @xmath1 norm and we observe superconvergence of order @xmath2 at the downwind point of each element . here",
    "@xmath3 is the degree of the approximation polynomial used in an element .",
    "for the two - term fodes ( [ secondclass ] ) , the ldg methods retains optimal convergence order in @xmath1-norm , and superconvergence at the downwind point of each element as @xmath7 .",
    "we shall discuss the underlying mechanism of this superconvergence and illustrate the results of the analysis through a number of examples , including some going beyond the theoretical developments presented here .",
    "what remains of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we present the ldg schemes for the fodes , discuss the numerical stability of the scheme for the linear case of ( [ firstclass ] ) with @xmath42 $ ] , and uncover the mechanism of superconvergence . the analysis is supported by a number of computational experiments and we also illustrate how the proposed scheme can be applied to compute the generalized mittag - leffler functions . in section 3",
    "we discuss a number of generalizations of the scheme , illustrated by a selection of numerical examples and section 4 contains a few concluding remarks .",
    "the basic idea in the design the ldg schemes is to rewrite the fodes as a system of the first order classical odes and a fractional integral .",
    "since the integral operator naturally connects the discontinuous function , we need not add a penalty term or introduce a numerical fluxes for the integral equation . however , for the first order odes , upwind fluxes are used . in this section",
