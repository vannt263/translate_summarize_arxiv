    "if electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model ( sm ) arises solely from the presence of a fundamental scalar , the scale of the electroweak interactions requires a severe fine - tuning .",
    "the economy of the higgs mechanism thus comes at the cost of making the sm unnatural .",
    "technicolor models @xcite aim to ameliorate this instability by considering the higgs as a composite state ; however , these simplest models are ruled out by their large oblique corrections @xcite .",
    "a new approach to a composite higgs is provided by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , in particular as represented by randall - sundrum ( rs1)-type setups @xcite .",
    "typically the higgs has been confined to a particular brane in the 5d picture , thus corresponding to a 4d state of infinite scaling dimension @xcite .",
    "this , however , is more than is necessary to avoid issues of extreme fine - tuning .",
    "even if the higgs is localized somewhere near the ir brane of rs1 , the corresponding 4d state is interpreted as a composite and can be light with tuning at only the percent level .",
    "this particular relaxation of the usual assumptions is the salient feature of the gaugephobic higgs model @xcite we consider below ( see also @xcite for other treatments of a 5d higgs ) .",
    "the crucial aspect of this model that we exploit is that the higgs can be made light ( e.g. @xmath5 gev ) while simultaneously suppressing its couplings to fermions and weak gauge bosons , such that current experimental constraints are evaded .",
    "the gaugephobic model is described in @xcite ; here we review only the features important for higgs production at b - factories . as in rs1",
    ", we have a slice of ads@xmath6 with conformally flat metric ( taking @xmath7 to denote the coordinate of the extra spatial dimension ) : @xmath8 @xmath9 corresponds to the position of the uv brane and sets the curvature scale of the extra dimension .",
    "the second boundary is at @xmath10 with @xmath11 generating the weak - planck hierarchy due to the warp factor .",
    "@xmath9 is a free parameter , while @xmath12 is set by the masses of the weak gauge bosons .",
    "the bulk gauge group @xmath13 is broken to @xmath14 by boundary conditions and a bi - fundamental higgs with zero @xmath15 charge . with the higgs taken to be a bulk field , we choose the three parameters @xmath16 to describe it . in our analysis",
    "we parameterize the effect of the higgs bulk mass @xmath17 by @xmath18 .",
    "conventional rs1 is described by the limit @xmath19 .",
    "the profile of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is controlled by uv brane boundary conditions to be @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the sm @xmath22 gauge coupling , and @xmath23 is the 5-dimensional @xmath24 gauge coupling .",
    "the normalization @xmath25 of the vev is chosen such that the sm is recovered as one takes @xmath26 gev : in this limit the gauge boson profiles are flat , with all mass coming from direct overlap with the higgs .",
    "conversely , in the limit @xmath27 the profiles of the gauge bosons are pushed towards the uv ( away from the ir - localized vev ) so that their mass comes entirely from momentum in the fifth dimension .",
    "this corresponds to the higgsless limit @xcite : in this case the kaluza - klein ( kk ) scale is lowered , so that the appearance of the weakly - coupled kk states fulfill the higgs boson s additional role of restoring unitarity in @xmath28-scattering .",
    "the other ingredient that establishes the profile ( [ vevprofile ] ) is the higgs quartic coupling @xmath29 , which is confined to the ir brane to ensure that electroweak symmetry breaking takes place there .",
    "we trade this parameter for the mass @xmath30 of the physical higgs mode via the effective potential s minimization condition , in the same way as in the sm .",
    "the couplings between the higgs and other states is provided by the overlap of the corresponding 5d profiles , so field localization governs interaction strength .",
    ".range of the scanned parameter space with the ads scale set by @xmath31 gev .",
    "the range of @xmath32 is chosen to localize the higgs vev towards the ir brane , while the range of @xmath25 is chosen to interpolate between the sm and `` almost higgsless '' limits .",
    "the bulk mass for the left- and right - handed bottom quark are constrained by the required precision of their coupling to the @xmath33 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the light fermions in the model are arranged in doublets of the bulk gauge group .",
    "the 5d fermions must be vector - like due to the nature of the 5d realization of the dirac algebra , so that bulk mass terms are allowed for them and will dictate their localization .",
    "they each have dimensionless bulk masses @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the left- and right - handed pieces as well as a uv kinetic term to split the masses within a given multiplet .",
    "the inclusion of the third quark generation requires more care , however , since the heavy top quark requires a large overlap with the higgs vev . with the top and bottom",
    "arranged together in doublets , this would lead to an unacceptable deviation in the @xmath36 coupling . we choose to solve this problem as in @xcite where non - universal corrections to the @xmath33-couplings are avoided by representing the left - handed bottom quark in a bi - doublet of the bulk @xmath37 .",
    "the total field content of the third generation thus contains the new fields @xmath38 and @xmath15 , where the quantum numbers of the @xmath38 allow it to mix with @xmath39 .",
    "the new exotic quark @xmath15 has electric charge 5/3 so wo nt mix with the other fields .",
    "the lowest lying @xmath15 state enters at @xmath40 .",
    "vs. @xmath25 . as @xmath41 gev from above the sm is approached , i.e. @xmath42 while as @xmath25 is increased the gauge bosons decouple from the higgs.,width=317 ]    the gaugephobic model is described by the five parameters shown in table  [ tab : params ] , with the ranges we considered . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hzzhbbvsv ] we scan over the parameter space imposing the constraints in this section .",
    "we find that _ all _ of the higgs couplings are suppressed in this model .",
    "lep searched for the higgs in the higgsstrahlung mode in which it is radiated off a @xmath33 boson through the @xmath43 coupling . by decoupling the higgs from the @xmath33 ,",
    "lep would have a sufficiently small rate that it could not discover the higgs  @xcite .",
    "we apply the decay mode independent bound on the higgsstrahlung cross section .",
    "this limit varies by a factor of two as a function of mass ; we apply @xmath44 which is the upper bound for the limit in the range @xmath45 , where we define the suppression relative to the sm of @xmath33 bosons and bottom quarks as @xmath46 with @xmath47 denoting the @xmath48 coupling and @xmath49 the bottom yukawa .",
    "these suppression factors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hzzhbbvsv ] and are uncorrelated with the higgs mass .",
    "the lep constraint depends only on the @xmath43 coupling and is independent of other modifications which would change the higgs decays .",
    "with the higgs decoupled from the @xmath33 , the next most relevant constraints come from radiating the higgs off @xmath50 quarks . for @xmath51 , the sm higgs",
    "was first ruled out by argus  @xcite in the channels @xmath52 and @xmath53 with the assumption that @xmath54 gev .",
    "however today we know from cdf and d0  @xcite that @xmath55 gev , which strongly enhances this branching ratio . for a sm higgs in this mass range , these channels would be dominant  @xcite because of an @xmath56 enhancement in the rate : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the dimensionless phase space factor for @xmath59 .",
    "we use this standard result to approximate the rate even in this model .",
    "new contributions coming from kk quarks will contain suppression not only from the top yukawa couplings , but also from both gauge couplings appearing in the diagram : the overall suppression from these three couplings makes their contribution substantially smaller than eq .",
    "[ eq : gammabhs ]",
    ". the exotic @xmath15 quark does not contribute to this process .",
    "thus to avoid regions that are tightly constrained to have an extremely weak higgs coupling , we prefer @xmath60 .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hzzhbbvsv ] , the couplings of the higgs become arbitrarily small as @xmath61 , so that a large enough vev could provide an adequate suppression in the top yukawa coupling to explain the observed rate . with the measured value  @xcite of @xmath62 and assuming @xmath63 , the gaugephobic higgs with @xmath64 is allowed when @xmath65 tev .",
    "at this point we have a suppression of the top yukawa coupling @xmath66 while @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath60 the most profitable mode to search is in @xmath68  @xcite where @xmath69 , which we discuss in detail in the next section .",
    "once the @xmath43 constraints are taken into account , the gaugephobic higgs also has suppressed couplings to @xmath50 quarks and therefore @xmath70 s .",
    "this mode was not as vigorously pursued as higgsstrahlung and @xmath71 meson decays because there is sufficient theoretical uncertainty in the predictions for this mode . even including these uncertainties ,",
    "this mode only barely reached the expected sm level .",
    "therefore lep data was used to rule out the sm higgs in the @xmath72 region instead .",
    "searches were performed by the cleo collaboration using @xmath4 decays to mono - energetic photons  @xcite .",
    "they limit @xmath73    the cusb collaboration measured the entire photon spectrum from upsilon decays  @xcite .",
    "they rule out earlier claims from mark iii  @xcite and crystal ball  @xcite of evidence for higgs resonances at 2.2 gev and 8.3 gev respectively .",
    "this limit just barely reaches the sm expectation @xmath74 for @xmath75 and worsens to limit @xmath76 as @xmath77 increases .",
    "finally the argus collaboration searched for a monochromatic photon line  @xcite in the ranges @xmath78 where the limits quoted are at the lowest @xmath30 and worsen slightly for higher @xmath30 .",
    "additionally , there is an important indirect constraint from the coupling of the @xmath33 to @xmath50 quarks , @xmath79 : for left - handed @xmath50 s this is constrained to be within @xmath800.25% of its sm value @xcite while for the right - handed fields the constraint is relaxed to @xmath8030%  @xcite .",
    "this accuracy is possible only with the third generation incorporated in the representations described above , and even then provides a stringent condition on the bulk masses of those fields .",
    "we point out that a complete analysis of electroweak precision parameters is lacking for this model .",
    "however it has been shown that in the higgsless limit , the large contributions to the @xmath81-parameter typical of technicolor models can in fact be cancelled in a holographic model by an appropriate `` de - localization '' ( i.e. tuning of the bulk masses ) of the bulk fermions @xcite .",
    "the effect of de - localization on our results is small : we have confirmed numerically that adding restrictions to the localization of the light fermions does not qualitatively change our results .",
    "at low masses , the gaugephobic higgs is produced by radiation from the heaviest fermion available .",
    "data with heavy fermions comes dominantly from producing @xmath70 and @xmath82 resonances .",
    "babar has collected 30.2 fb@xmath83 on the @xmath2 and 14.45 fb@xmath83 on the @xmath3 , complementing the 3 fb@xmath83 collected by belle , and older results from cleo .",
    "the higgs is radiated from vector resonances @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "the photon is monochromatic with an energy @xmath85 because the higgs is extremely narrow ( @xmath86 mev ) for these masses . the relative rate assuming a coulomb - like potential for the @xmath87 state is  @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the suppression relative to the sm .",
    "the factor @xmath90 includes any next - to - leading order corrections , most notably the leading one - loop qcd correction  @xcite and relativistic correction  @xcite .",
    "all of these corrections reduce the branching ratio to higgs over the entire mass range , but there is considerable uncertainty as to how to combine the various contributions . see @xcite for further discussion . since these two corrections are coming respectively from hard and soft gluon effects , we simply combine the two to find the approximate branching fraction for @xmath91 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : br ] . the relative uniformity of this plot reflects the fact that the suppression of the bottom yukawa coupling has little direct dependence on the mass of the physical higgs .",
    "numerical differences between this rate for the @xmath92 state and the same rate for the lighter @xmath93 resonances can be determined from the difference in the partial width @xmath94 of each .     to a photon and higgs , as a function of higgs mass.,width=302 ]    unfortunately the @xmath95 data is almost useless in the wilczek mode because its width is so much larger . for the @xmath95 data to be competitive with @xmath2 data , one needs approximately @xmath96 times more data because the @xmath95 is above threshold for decay into a pair of @xmath71 mesons and consequently has a very large width .",
    "however , one can profitably search for a higgs in @xmath71 meson decays using @xmath95 decays , albeit with reduced kinematic reach @xmath97 gev .",
    "a light higgs boson is experimentally excluded only when its couplings to other sm fields are sufficiently large",
    ". there still exists a class of viable models in which these couplings are suppressed in an `` almost higgsless '' scenario , allowing for the potential discovery of a light higgs at b - factories .",
    "this discovery would be associated with the discovery at the lhc of heavy @xmath1 and @xmath0 kaluza - klein resonances and no higgs .",
    "we show the range of viable parameters within the gaugephobic higgs model . for a higgs lighter than 10 gev",
    ", the relevant signal would be an excess of monochromatic photons in @xmath98 data , associated with a pair of heavy fermions such as charm or tau .",
    "a higgs lighter than the @xmath71 meson is much more tightly constrained to be nearly higgsless , and can be discovered in @xmath99 using @xmath95 data .",
