    "<S> depth - dependent atomic and molecular density fractions may be computed for arbitrary gas density , far - ultraviolet field intensity , and the metallicity dependent h@xmath1 formation rate coefficient , and dust absorption cross section in the lyman - werner photodissociation band . </S>",
    "<S> we use our procedure to generate a set of transition profiles for a wide range of conditions , from the weak- to strong - field limits , and from super - solar down to low metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if presented as functions of dust optical depth the hi and h@xmath1 density profiles depend primarily on the sternberg  @xmath2 parameter \" ( dimensionless ) that determines the dust optical depth associated with the total photodissociated hi column . we derive a universal analytic formula for the transition points as a function of just @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> . our formula will be useful for interpreting emission - line observations of hi/ h@xmath1 interfaces , for estimating star - formation thresholds , and for sub - grid components in hydrodynamics simulations . </S>"
