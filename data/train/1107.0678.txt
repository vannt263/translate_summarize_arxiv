    "radiation flux ( @xmath10 ) from a unit surface area of an optically thick disk toward a unit solid angle at the polar angle of @xmath11 decreases with an increasing @xmath12 as follows ( netzer 1987 ) : @xmath13 here , the first term represents the change in the projected surface area , while the latter represents the limb darkening effect for plasma , whose opacity is dominated by electron scattering over absorption ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1985 ; phillips & meszaros 1986 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : flux_theta_dep ] shows the @xmath11-dependency of @xmath14 , where the former effect alone is also drawn for comparison .",
    "an accretion disk emits lesser radiation in the direction closer to its equatorial plane ( i.e. , larger @xmath12 ; laor & netzer 1989 ; sun & malkan 1989 ; hubeny et al .",
    "if the torus and the disk are aligned , the assumption of isotropic emission from accretion disks ( e.g. , equation ( [ eq : bar87 ] ) ) obviously overestimates the radiation flux toward the torus , leading the overestimation of the inner radius of the torus .",
    "this effect works even if the disk is infinitesimally thin . as shown in section [ sec : qmax ] , a nonzero thickness of the disk brings about another anisotropy of illumination flux , such that the torus is not illuminated below the disk height at @xmath12 larger than a critical angle @xmath15 . except in section [ sec : qmax ] , we throughout adopt a thin disk with an aspect ratio of @xmath16 , like the standard accretion disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "the effects of anisotropic emission and orientation have been discussed in the context of the baldwin effect in the line fluxes of photo - ionised emission ( netzer 1985 ; francis 1993 ; bottorff et al .",
    "these effects upon the torus were examined for the first time in paper i.      the inner edge of the torus is determined so that the temperature of a clump ( at the irradiated surface ) equals @xmath2 there . since the radiation flux from the disk @xmath10 varies with the polar angle @xmath12 , the sublimation radius of the torus @xmath17 is also a function of @xmath12 .",
    "namely , @xmath17 is the distance between the torus edge and the central bh for various @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast , we express the sublimation radius estimated under the isotropic emission assumption ( equation ( [ eq : bar87 ] ) ) as @xmath4 .",
    "the anisotropic illumination given in equation ( [ eq : flux ] ) results in @xmath18^{0.5}. \\label{eq : rsub}\\ ] ] here , @xmath19 is the polar angle toward the observer seen from the central accretion disk . outside this radius , there are numerous clumps with their temperature below @xmath2 . in the case of an isotropic emission from the disk ,",
    "the torus edge is supposed to stand at a distance of @xmath4 .",
    "although various grain sizes result in the sublimation process occurring over a transition zone rather than a single distance ( nenkova et al .",
    "2008 ) , we employ a sharp boundary for simplicity .    in paper",
    "i , we found that ( 1 ) the torus inner edge is located closer to the central bh than suggested by previous estimations ( equation ( [ eq : bar87 ] ) ) and that ( 2 ) the structure of the edge is concave / hollow .",
    "moreover , ( 3 ) our result indicated that the innermost edge of the torus may connect with the outermost edge of the accretion disk continuously ( e.g. , emmering et al .",
    "1992 ; elitzur & shlosman 2006 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic ] shows a schematic view of the torus inner region .",
    "if the torus is indeed a reservoir of gas for the disk , angular momenta of the infalling gas will align these axes .",
    "the misalignment between the torus and the disk is investigated in section [ sec : misaligned ] .",
    "current interferometric nir observations ( e.g. , swain et al .",
    "2003 ; kishimoto et al . 2009 ) and future adaptive optics imaging with @xmath20 m telescopes can not spatially resolve the innermost region ( radius and shape ) of the torus in nearby seyfert galaxies .",
    "thus , observations of time variability will continue to be powerful tools to probe the innermost structure of the torus even in the coming decade .",
    "we calculate the time variation of nir emission in response to a @xmath21-function like variation of the optical / uv illumination [ transfer function @xmath22 .",
    "transfer functions contain various information of the re - emitting region , such as the shape and the emissivity profile etc ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; netzer 1990 ; gaskell et al .",
    "time variation of the reprocessed radiation ( nir in this study ) is a convolution of the illumination flux variation with @xmath23 . we calculate @xmath23 and its centroid @xmath24 , which corresponds to the observed time lag .",
    "since the time profile is also one of the characteristics of this study compared to the earlier work ( sections [ sec : phi_contri ] and [ sec : theta_contri ] ) , we also calculate the width @xmath25 and the skewness @xmath26 to describe the shape of @xmath23 : @xmath27^{0.5}\\\\ s & = &   \\int ( t - t_{\\rm delay})^3 \\ , \\psi ( t ) \\ , dt \\",

    "the computed @xmath25 and @xmath26 would be useful to interpret and predict the cross correlation functions between nir and optical / uv light curves .",
    "a larger @xmath25 will correspond to a larger uncertainty in the measurements of the time delay .",
    "as to the detectability of nir variations , a small @xmath25 and a high @xmath23 indicate the relative ( i.e. in mag ) and absolute ( e.g. , in ergs@xmath28 ) variability , respectively .    when the illumination flux varies , the inner edge of the torus shifts in principle ( laor 2004 ) . depending on whether dust grains in the clumps",
    "are sublimated or not , clumps belong to either the broad emission line region or the dusty torus ( netzer & laor 1993 ; suganuma et al .",
    "however , it takes @xmath29year for the inner region of the torus to adjust to the varying illumination flux ( koshida et al . 2009 ; pott et al .",
    "thus , we regard that the inner structure of the dusty torus is steady in the timescale of nir - to - optical time lag ( @xmath30months ) .    to calculate @xmath23 for the clumpy torus",
    ", we consider the following items ; ( 1 ) the optical path , ( 2 ) nir emissivity of the torus inner region as a function of @xmath12 and ( 3 ) anisotropic emission of each clump . in this work ,",
    "( 4 ) we include the effect of torus self - occultation ( i.e. , absorption of nir emission from a clump by other clumps on the line of sight ) . while the torus self - occultation is a minor effect for a typical type-1 agn , it plays a significant role for inclined viewing angles , thick tori and misaligned tori .",
    "considering the self - occultation , we ignore the response from the aligned torus at @xmath31 ( appendix ) .",
    "first , ( 1 ) the optical path difference is written as @xmath32 ,   \\label{eq : opd}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the azimuthal angle and defined so that @xmath34 for the observer ( figure  [ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "the concave shape of the inner region of the torus reduces the optical path difference .",
    "clumps at slightly farther and those at slightly closer than @xmath35 will also emit nir radiation , smearing out the resultant nir response .",
    "since this effect unlikely changes the @xmath23 drastically , we consider only optical paths that hit the inner edge of the torus .",
    "next , ( 2 ) for the emissivity as a function of @xmath12 , we assume that ( 2 - 1 ) the clump size increases and ( 2 - 2 ) the clump number density decreases when the clump - to - bh distance increases ( e.g. , hnig et al .",
    "2006 ; schartmann et al .",
    "following paper i , the emissivity of nir flux per @xmath36 is assumed to be proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "third , ( 3 ) the anisotropy of the nir emission from each clump is considered , since clumps are optically thick to nir ( and optical / uv ) radiation ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "namely , the question is how extent the illuminated surface of a clump is seen by the observer ( nenkova et al .",
    "let us suppose that an observer looks at a clump with an angle @xmath38 , where @xmath39 means a face - on view of the illuminated surface .",
    "we adopt the following anisotropic coefficient for the waning effect , @xmath40 .",
    "\\label{eq : waning}\\ ] ] this coefficient is chosen so as to reproduce the monte carlo calculations by hnig et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for a single clump observed from three different @xmath38 .",
    "finally , ( 4 ) if the line of sight from a region to the observer passes through the torus , we omit the nir flux from such a region .",
    "radiation energy absorbed by the clumps on the way will be re - radiated at mid - ir bands .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ fig : phi_contribution ] presents the resultant transfer function of the aligned torus for @xmath19 = 25 , calculated by summing up the nir responses from different portions of the torus at ( @xmath11 , @xmath33 ) .",
    "the integration is done from @xmath41 to @xmath42 in the @xmath11-direction and 0 to @xmath43 in the @xmath33-direction . here , the opening angle of the torus @xmath41 is assumed to be 45 , which is roughly consistent with various observational results ( e.g. , the ratio between types-1 and -2 agns and/or opening angles of light cones in the narrow line region ) , and the maximum @xmath11 of the torus @xmath42 is set to 89  ( i.e. , thin disk approximation ) .",
    "this parameter set is identical to the one adopted in paper i , and is regarded as fiducial in this study .",
    "the mean delay @xmath24 , the width @xmath25 and the skewness @xmath26 of @xmath23 are @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . for typical seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars ( e.g. , with uv luminosity of @xmath47ergs@xmath28 and @xmath48ergs@xmath28 ) ,",
    "the expected inner radii @xmath4 are @xmath300.1 and 1pc ( equation [ eq : bar87 ] ) , while our resultant delays @xmath24 for the fiducial parameter set are about a month and a year , respectively ( see figure [ fig : tl ] ) .",
    "the long - dashed line is computed by switching off both the waning effect and the torus self - occultation , making the left horn higher than the right one similar to the time response of optically thin tori ( barvainis 1992 ) .",
    "then , the short - dashed line takes into account the waning effect , and is identical to the @xmath23 presented in paper i , with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the torus self - occultation results in a slight increase of @xmath24 and a more skewed profile .",
    "we will see the reason for these changes in the next subsection .      in order to clarify contributions from different @xmath52",
    ", we divide the torus inner edge into three regions equally .",
    "the three solid lines in figure [ fig : phi_contribution ] show the @xmath23 from each @xmath52 range . among them , the left one is produced by the low @xmath52 region ( @xmath53 ) , showing the rapid response at @xmath54 ( due to a short optical path difference ) and a strong reduction of flux by the waning effect ( large @xmath38 ) and the torus self - occultation . on the contrary ,",
    "the right one with the longer delay at @xmath55 comes from the large @xmath52 region ( @xmath56 ) , where clumps tend to direct their illuminated surface toward the observer , suffering from less waning effect .",
    "we see that the torus self - occultation affects no influence at @xmath57 with the fiducial parameter set . in other words , both the waning effect and the self - occultation selectively reduce the emission from the region with a short delay , making the right horn higher than the left one , opposing to the results for optically thin tori ( barvainis 1992 ) .",
    "the fluences , @xmath58 , from each @xmath52 region are 1.3 , 6.4 and 10.4 from low to high @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "later , we change the torus thickness ( section [ sec : qmin ] ) and the disk thickness ( section [ sec : qmax ] ) . to understand how they will affect the time response of nir emission , we draw @xmath23 from different @xmath12 ranges ( at @xmath59 ) separately in figure [ fig : theta_contribution]a .",
    "it turns out that most nir flux arises from small @xmath12 regions at @xmath60   ( i.e. , the region with a high latitude from the equatorial plane ) , which show similar time delay . because the emissivity is assumed in proportion to @xmath37 , the fluence from the largest @xmath12 range ( 7589 ) near the equatorial plane , where the torus inner edge is closest to the central bh , is small .",
    "the nir fluences from each @xmath12 range , from small to large @xmath12 , is 8.4 , 6.8 and 2.9 , respectively .",
    "therefore , little difference in @xmath24 for various @xmath42 and a shorter @xmath24 for an extremely thin ( @xmath61 ) torus are expected .",
    "consequences of a thick torus are not drawn straightforwardly , because of the torus self - occultation .    in case",
    "the torus is optically thin ( cf .",
    "appendix ) , we shortly mention the contribution from the far side ( @xmath62 ) of the torus . depending on the origin of optical / uv time variability of agns ( x - ray reprocessing or change in the accretion rate etc . ; e.g. , kawaguchi et al .",
    "1998 ; sakata et al . 2011 ) , the link between the disk fluxes to @xmath62 and to @xmath59 will vary .",
    "the nir time variations from @xmath62 is controlled by the variations of the disk flux to @xmath62 , which we can not observe .",
    "thus , if the disk illumination to the two sides are random , the nir flux variations from @xmath62 influence the measurements of the optical / uv - to - nir lag as noise . on the other hand",
    ", if the time variations of disk illumination toward the two sides are similar , the time delay of nir emission will become longer , as follows . to calculate the nir response from @xmath62 , we replace @xmath63 in equation ( [ eq : rsub ] ) by @xmath64 , and switched off the self - occultation effect .",
    "figure [ fig : theta_contribution]b presents nir responses from @xmath62 , which have long time delay due to their long light path . if no extinction affects the nir emission from @xmath62 ( as barvainis 1992 assumed ) , we will obtain the net response from @xmath65   with @xmath24 of @xmath66 .",
    "in other words , a long @xmath24 may be a signature of an extremely low volume filling factor of clumps in the torus and/or a very thin torus ( appendix ) .",
    "in this section , we present various dependencies of the nir emission from the torus whose rotation axis is aligned to the disk axis . at the end of each subsection",
    ", we shortly summarise the obtained dependency by contrasting with the result for the fiducial parameter set .",
    "figure [ fig : thetaobs_tf ] shows the transfer functions for various @xmath19 , from an exactly pole - on geometry ( @xmath67 ) to inclined viewing angles . with a large @xmath19 ( @xmath68@xmath69 ) , the line of sight grazes the upper boundary of the torus , which would corresponds to the situation in type-1.8/1.9 agns . here ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are fixed at 45  and 89 , respectively .",
    "as @xmath19 increases , we see that ( 1 ) the centroid of the response @xmath24 increases , ( 2 ) the nir fluence @xmath58 also increases , and ( 3 ) the profile becomes broad .",
    "in addition , ( 4 ) @xmath23 is quite peaky for a nearly face - on geometry .",
    "the first and second results are our new findings .",
    "although the third and forth trends are already reported for optically thin tori by barvainis ( 1992 ) , we find here that both trends are also true for optically thick tori .",
    "first , ( 1 ) @xmath24 is drawn as a function of @xmath19 in figure [ fig : thetaobs_tdelay ] . for comparison ,",
    "the result computed without the self - occultation is also shown .",
    "the torus veils selectively the region with a short delay ( figure [ fig : phi_contribution ] ) , hence enlarges @xmath24 .",
    "the self - occultation shows larger influences for more inclined angles . on the right - hand side",
    ", we also draw a histogram of the observed delay in the unit of @xmath70 ( based on figure [ fig : tl ] ) .",
    "the computed @xmath24 ranges from 0.27 to 0.74@xmath70 ( 0.27 to 0.60@xmath70 without the self - occultation ) , which covers the range of the observed time delay .",
    "in contrast , since barvainis ( 1992 ) assumed an optically thin torus , @xmath24 was expected to have no ( or quite weak ) @xmath19-dependency .",
    "since such a broad range is not achieved by the changes of @xmath41 and @xmath42 as we will see later , we propose that the viewing angle is the key parameter responsible for the observed scatter about the regression line in the @xmath24@xmath6 diagram ( oknyanskij & horne 2001 ; suganuma et al . 2006 ) .",
    "conversely , the measurements of @xmath24 are potentially useful to estimate the inclination angles .    in order to compare our results with the observed data more directly , the @xmath24 v.s .",
    "@xmath6 diagram is drawn in figure [ fig : tl ] ( suganuma et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "following kishimoto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we estimate @xmath6 by @xmath71 .",
    "the uncertainty of the @xmath24 is @xmath72 on average .",
    "our loci for various @xmath19 ( with @xmath41 and @xmath42 fixed at the fiducial values ) well cover the observed scatter .",
    "a type-1.5 seyfert galaxy ngc3227 ( triangle ) is located at an area with a small @xmath19 ( @xmath73@xmath74 ) , which would require a hysteresis effect ( koshida et al .",
    "2009 ) or a thin torus for its relatively short @xmath24 . among the three points for ngc4151 ( green diamonds ) , the lower two data ( collected in 1969 - 1980 and 1990 - 1998 ) are consistent with a pole - on view , while the upper one in 2001 indicates an inclined angle . a change of the viewing angle on the timescale of tens years , due to e.g.",
    ", a precession of the disk , is indicated .",
    "second , ( 2 ) the top panel of figure [ fig : thetaobs_lssp ] shows that the nir fluence toward the observer , @xmath58 , is insensitive to the viewing angle at @xmath75 and increases with @xmath19 at more inclined angles ( solid line ) . comparing @xmath76  with @xmath77 , the fluence increases by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "due to the self - occultation , the nir flux decreases by 19% at @xmath78  and by 2628% at @xmath79@xmath69 .    regarding a continuous illumination from the disk as a series of flash",
    ", we can draw conclusions other than the time response of nir emission .",
    "namely , the obtained nir fluence indicates the nir flux toward the observer under a given steady optical / uv illumination .",
    "we recall that we compute for various objects with a common optical flux toward the observer .",
    "therefore , the @xmath80-axis ( nir fluence ) directly indicates the nir - to - optical color . in other words ,",
    "the nir - to - optical color becomes red as @xmath19 increases .",
    "we thus argue that the red ir - optical color observed for type-1.8/1.9 agns compared with type-1 objects ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2003 ) arises not only from dust extinction but also from their intrinsically red color .    the red color for large @xmath19 objects can originate in the reduction of optical flux toward large @xmath11 ( equation ( [ eq : flux ] ) ) and/or in the change of nir flux .",
    "here , we try to distinguish its origin .",
    "the dotted line shows the disk flux toward @xmath81 , in proportion to @xmath82^{-1}$ ] , normalised so that it coincides with the nir fluence at @xmath76 .",
    "if the nir emission is isotropic , the nir fluence in this diagram should change as the dotted line . instead , if the computed nir fluence is smaller ( or larger ) than the dotted line , it means the nir flux decreases ( or increases ) with @xmath11 .",
    "our result indicates that the nir flux decreases with @xmath11 due to the torus self - occultation , but its @xmath11-dependency is weaker than that of the disk flux , thereby presenting the red nir - optical color for inclined angles .",
    "the reduction of the nir flux toward a larger @xmath19 is consistent with the radiative transfer calculations under an isotropic optical / uv illumination ( hnig et al .",
    "2006 ; nenkova et al .",

    "in other words , the self - occultation by the region with @xmath85 and @xmath91 hides the rapid response ( left horn ) , which originates in the large @xmath11 ( @xmath92 ) region and becomes visible when the torus gets thin ( @xmath93 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the self - occultation unlikely influences the result for a thin torus . as shown in section [ sec : theta_contri ] , a rapid response is obtained when the torus is extremely thin ( @xmath61 ) , since @xmath94 is small at large @xmath11 .    to see the @xmath41-dependency more quantitatively ,",

    "clearly , @xmath24 becomes short for thin tori .",
    "therefore , we expect that luminous quasars will show a relatively short time delay in the unit of @xmath70 .",

    "thus , it is not obvious how the nir fluence of our torus model varies with @xmath97 .",

    "the steeper decline of the nir flux in our result is likely due to the @xmath11 dependency of @xmath105 , in contrast to the constant sublimation radius ( resulted from the presumed istropic illumination ) in their computations .",
    "next , we move on to the result for a thick torus .",
    "the self - occultation reduces the nir flux by 5567% for @xmath106@xmath90 , whereas it results in a reduction by @xmath107% for the fiducial @xmath41 of @xmath108 . due to the self - occultation , too thick tori with @xmath109",

    "the flux reduction of a thick torus compared with a modestly thick torus is again consistent with the result by nenkova et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "bringing together the two behaviours , both a thick and a thin tori show the weak nir emission .",
    "namely , a modest thickness of the torus leads to the strongest nir emission .",
    "therefore , a selection bias will arise such that nir - selected agns tend to possess moderately thick tori .    compared with the modest torus thickness ( @xmath89 ) , both a thick and a thin tori display the weaker nir emission ( i.e. , a bluer nir - optical color ) .",
    "a thick torus shows a slightly delayed , narrow and largely skewed nir response . on the other hand ,",
    "as the torus gets thinner , the nir response becomes more rapid , narrower , closer to time - symmetric and low .",
    "when the accretion rate exceeds the eddington rate ( @xmath111 ) , an optically thick advection - dominated accretion flow ( a slim disk ) appears ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) . since super - eddington disks are geometrically thick ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ; madau 1988 ) , they can not illuminate the directions near their equatorial plane by the disk self - occultation ( fukue 2000 ) .",
    "as discussed in paper i , some agns with presumably super - eddington accretion rates show the weak nir emission ( ark564 , tons180 , j0005 and j0303 ; rodrguez - ardila & mazzalay 2006 ; kawaguchi et al .",

    "; see , however , hao et al . 2010 ) .",
    "small @xmath42 due to the self - occultation by a geometrically thick disk can be a reason for the weakness .",
    "moreover , the observed data do not support the concept of eddington - limited accretion ( collin & kawaguchi 2004 ) .",
    "thus , a strong anisotropy of the disk emission , such as equation ( [ eq : flux ] ) and the disk self - occultation , is required to allow gas infall to super - eddington accreting sources . in this subsection",
    ", we examine the influences of the disk thickness and the accretion rate upon the nir emission in more detail .    in principle , the disk thickness is a function of the distance from the central bh .",
    "both the illumination spectrum from an agn disk and the absorption efficiency of dust have their peaks at far - uv ( e.g. , laor & draine 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , we deduce the disk thickness at the far - uv emitting region . based on the work by kawaguchi ( 2003 ; his figure 5 for a @xmath112 bh ) , the semi - thickness of the disk ( = 90@xmath113 ) at the region with the temperature of ( 45)@xmath114k are 1 , 4 , 17  and 39 , for the accretion rates of 1 , 10 , 100 and 1000@xmath115 , respectively . comparing the first and the last cases , the solid angle of the torus illuminated by the disk ( equation [ eq : omega ] ) differs by a factor of @xmath309 ( a smaller @xmath97 with a higher accretion rate ) .",
    "transfer functions for four accretion rates are presented in figure [ fig : thetamax_tf ] . as we see in section [ sec : theta_contri ] , @xmath24 is insensitive to @xmath42 ( top panel of figure [ fig : thetamax_tlss ] ) .",
    "therefore , the observed broad range of @xmath24 is not reproduced by a change of the accretion rate .",
    "larger accretion rates make the disk thicker and the shade of the disk itself larger ( i.e. , smaller @xmath97 ; equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the nir fluence becomes small as the accretion rate increases , as shown in the second panel . by changing the accretion rate from 1 to 1000@xmath115",
    ", the fluence becomes @xmath116 .",
    "this is consistent with the weakness of the x - ray emission line from neutral iron , which potentially originates in the illuminated torus , in a narrow - line quasar ( takahashi et al .",
    "2010 ; cf . page et al .",
    "similar to @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are insensitive to @xmath42 ( third panel ) . on the contrary , the height of @xmath23 ( bottom panel ) is affected by the accretion rates in the sense that super - eddington sources will show a low absolute variation .",
    "other than the reduction of @xmath42 and @xmath97 , super - eddington accretion rates cause another influence upon the nir flux .",
    "sub - eddington accretion disks suffer little from the disk self - gravity , hence extend far away from the central bh , radiating across uv , optical and nir bands ( tomita et al .",
    "2006 ; kishimoto et al .",
    "when the accretion rate becomes super - eddington , the disk self - gravity starts to govern the disk and truncate the outer part of the disk . due to the truncation",
    ", super - eddington disks do not radiate at nir ( kawaguchi et al .",
    "2004 ) . to sum up ,",
    "both small @xmath42 of the torus and the small outer radius of the disk , caused by the high accretion rate , provide less nir emission .",
    "in contrast to the result for a thin disk with a sub - eddington accretion rate of @xmath115 , a super - eddington accretion rate leads to a much weaker nir emission ( with a help of the disk self - gravity ) and to a low time response .    here",
    ", we summarise the three dependencies examined above .",
    "only the variation of the viewing angles reproduces the observed range of the time delay .",
    "therefore , we propose that the viewing angle is the key parameter responsible for the observed scatter in the @xmath24@xmath6 diagram . a weak nir emission ( such as in hot - dust - poor agns in the weakest cases )",
    "indicates either a thin torus , a thick torus or the super - eddington accretion . on the other hand , a stronger nir flux ( a redder nir - optical color ) than the fiducial one",
    "is obtained only by a large viewing angle for a modestly thick torus .",
    "so far , we have assumed that the rotation axis of the torus is aligned to that of the disk .",
    "since a specific angular momentum is likely larger in the torus than in the disk , the assumption sounds plausible .",
    "indeed , we have examples , where the rotation axes of maser disks are aligned to the jet directions ( e.g. , miyoshi et al . 1995 ; meisenheimer et al . 2007 ;",
    "mamyoda et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , there are also a number of examples showing the misalignment between the maser disks and the jets ( e.g. , yamauchi et al .",
    "2004 ; raban et al .",
    "random orientation between jets and galactic axes is also reported ( clarke et al . 1998 ; nagar & wilson 1999 ; schmitt et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in this section ,",
    "we investigate the consequences of the misalignment between the torus and the disk axes .",
    "now , we introduce @xmath117 and @xmath118 to specify the rotation axis of the torus relative to that of the disk and the observer ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : schematic ] shows the geometry with @xmath119  and @xmath120 .",
    "three @xmath117 are examined ; 30 , 60  and 90 . in the first two cases , we adopt @xmath19 of @xmath121 . since the direction to @xmath19 of @xmath122 is obscured by the torus if @xmath123 , @xmath19 of 65  is chosen in the last case . with @xmath124  and 90 ,",
    "the inner edge of the torus at @xmath62 becomes visible .",

    "is realized for @xmath117 of 90@xmath131 , accompanied with a fluence similar to the one for the fiducial parameter .",

    "clumps with optical depth at @xmath174-band of @xmath176@xmath177 are often adopted ( nenkova et al .",

    "krolik & begelman ( 1988 ) estimates @xmath162 to be @xmath178 ( @xmath30one tenth of equation ( [ eq : clumnh ] ) ) .",
    "even with such a reduction of the clump opacity by @xmath179@xmath180 , each clump is still opaque to nir photons .",
    "therefore , optical thickness of the torus @xmath181 is simply related to the probability that the incoming rays hit clumps .",
    "we treat the two directions separately : one in the vertical direction ( parallel to the rotation axis ) with a suffix of @xmath182 , and another along the equatorial plane with a suffix of @xmath183 .",
    "the key parameter here is the volume filling factor of clumps in the torus @xmath184 , for which we assume 0.03 ( vollmer et al . 2004 ) . by writing the number density of clumps in the torus by @xmath185 , @xmath186 where we assume the thickness of the torus @xmath187 to be @xmath188",
    "now , @xmath181 means the mean number of clumps along the ray , and a fraction @xmath189 of the incoming rays pass through the torus without encountering any clumps ( natta & panagia 1984 ; nenkova et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "if we adopt the clump size in equation ( [ eq : clumpsize ] ) , then @xmath190 assuming that clumps are mainly heated by the direct illumination from the central accretion disk ( i.e. ignoring the irradiation from nearby clumps ) , the clump temperature will be proportional to @xmath191 , with @xmath192 being the illumination luminosity ( cf .",
    "nenkova et al .",
    "therefore , the size of torus emission is larger for larger @xmath192 at longer @xmath193 , in the form @xmath194 ( tristram et al . 2009 ) .",
    "then , we assume for @xmath163 as follows , @xmath195 with @xmath196 being the eddington luminosity . in summary , @xmath197 figure [ fig : tautorus ] shows the optical thickness of the clumpy torus as a function of @xmath157 . throughout",
    ", we fix @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath184 so that these in parentheses in equation ( [ eq : tautorus ] ) equal unity . for instance",
    ", @xmath200 is about five at @xmath157 of 0.1pc .",
    "the radius where the torus is opaque @xmath201 is achieved by setting @xmath202 : @xmath203 the inner part within this radius of the torus is likely optically thick . in this study",
    ", we therefore consider basically emission from the near side of the torus , as we did in paper i. this assumption can be tested in principle via the profile of broad emission lines and its time variation ( e.g. , peterson 2001 ) .",
    "if some indications of the emission from the far side of the torus is observed , the volume filling factor seems extremely low ( @xmath204 ) or the torus is very thin ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "similarly , we deduce the optical thickness perpendicular to the rotation axis @xmath206 , which is equivalent to @xmath207 ( the average number of clumps along radial equatorial rays ) denoted by nenkova et al .",
    "they showed that @xmath207 is likely between 5 and 15 , consistent with our estimation below . adopting the inner radius of @xmath4 and the clump size in equation ( [ eq : clumpsize ] ) , @xmath208 here , we assume @xmath209 .",
    "since this optical thickness is also larger than unity , we restrict ourselves to non - obscured objects ( i.e. , the geometry where the line of sight to the central bh is not blocked by the torus ) ."
