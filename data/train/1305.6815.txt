    "the existence of new physics structures beyond those of the standard model ( sm ) is motivated , among other things , by the puzzles of dark matter ( dm ) and inflation . the minimal way to address these problems",
    "is to add a `` hidden '' sector containing the required sm  singlet fields .",
    "the existence of the hidden sector can also be motivated from the top  down viewpoint , in particular , by realistic string constructions @xcite .",
    "such a sector can couple to the sm fields through products of gauge  singlet operators , including those of dimension 2 and 3 . in this work",
    ", we study in detail the corresponding couplings to the hypercharge field .",
    "let us define the `` hidden sector '' as a set of fields which carry no sm gauge quantum numbers .",
    "then a `` portal '' @xcite would be an operator that couples the sm fields to such sm singlets .",
    "let us consider the minimal case : suppose that the relevant low energy degrees of freedom in the hidden sector are those of a weyl fermion @xmath2 , or a massive vector @xmath3 , or a real scalar @xmath4 ( one field at a time ) .",
    "then the lowest , up to @xmath54 , dimension operators which couple the sm to the hidden sector are given by @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the lepton doublet ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the field strength tensors for hypercharge and @xmath3 , respectively ; @xmath10 is an sm fermion with generation index @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the covariant derivative with respect to the sm gauge symmetries , and @xmath13 are constants .",
    "note that a particular version of operator @xmath14 is induced by @xmath15 after diagonalization of the vector kinetic terms .",
    "an attractive feature of such an extension of the standard model is that it can offer viable dark matter candidates as well as provide a link to the inflaton sector .",
    "in particular , a sufficiently light `` right  handed neutrino '' @xmath2 is long  lived and can constitute warm dark matter @xcite .",
    "also , a massive vector @xmath3 ( or a scalar @xmath4 @xcite ) can inherit a @xmath16 symmetry from hidden sector gauge interactions , which would eliminate terms linear in @xmath3 and make it a stable cold dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "finally , the higgs coupling @xmath17 to the inflaton @xmath4 would be instrumental in reconciling metastability of the electroweak vacuum with inflation @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we explore a more general @xmath54 hypercharge coupling to the hidden sector , when the latter contains multiple u(1 ) s . in this case , a chern  simons ",
    "type coupling becomes possible @xcite .",
    "if such a coupling is the only sm portal into the hidden sector , the lightest u(1 ) vector field can play the role of dark matter .",
    "the trademark signature of this scenario is the presence of monochromatic gamma ",
    "ray lines in the photon spectrum of the galactic center .",
    "we analyze general experimental constraints on the chern  simons ",
    "type coupling as well as the constraints applicable when the vector field constitutes dark matter .",
    "suppose the `` hidden '' sector contains two massive u(1 ) gauge fields @xmath18 and @xmath12 . before electroweak symmetry breaking ,",
    "the most general dim-4 interactions of these fields with the hypercharge boson @xmath19 are described by the lagrangian @xmath20 here we have assumed cp symmetry such that terms of the type @xmath21 are not allowed ( see @xcite for a study of the latter ) .",
    "the kinetic and mass mixing can be eliminated by field redefinition @xcite , which to first order in the mixing parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 reads @xmath24 in terms of the new fields , the lagrangian is @xmath25 which will be the starting point for our phenomenological analysis .",
    "we note that , due to the kinetic mixing @xmath26 , @xmath18 and @xmath12 have small couplings to the standard model matter .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the effect of the chern  simons  type term @xmath27 , we will set @xmath26 to be very small or zero in most of our analysis .",
    "the term @xmath27 has dimension 4 .",
    "however , it vanishes in the limit of zero vector boson masses by gauge invariance , both for the higgs and stckelberg mechanisms .",
    "this means that it comes effectively from a higher dimensional operator with @xmath28 proportional to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cutoff scale or the mass scale of heavy particles we have integrated out . on one hand",
    ", this operator does not decouple as @xmath31 since both @xmath32 and @xmath30 are given by the `` hidden '' higgs vev times the appropriate couplings ; on the other hand , @xmath27 is phenomenologically relevant only if @xmath32 are not far above the weak scale .",
    "thus , this term represents a meaningful approximation in a particular energy window , which we will quantify later .",
    "( a similar situation occurs in the vector higgs portal models , where the interaction @xmath33 has naive dimension 4 , but originates from a dim-6 operator @xcite . ) from the phenomenological perspective , it is important that @xmath27 is the leading operator at low energies , e.g. relevant to non  relativistic annihilation of dark matter composed of @xmath18 or @xmath12 , and thus we will restrict our attention to this coupling only .",
    "a coupling of this sort appears in various models upon integrating out heavy fields charged under both u(1 ) s and hypercharge .",
    "explicit anomaly ",
    "free examples can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the chern ",
    "simons term arises upon integrating out heavy , vector  like with respect to the sm , fermions .",
    "both the vectors and the fermions get their masses from the higgs mechanism , while the latter can be made heavy by choosing large yukawa couplings compared to the gauge couplings . in this limit , eq .  @xmath34 gives the corresponding low energy action .",
    "reduce to the chern - simons term on  shell in the non  relativistic limit ( @xmath35 ; @xmath36 and similarly for @xmath37 ) .",
    "such operators should generally be taken into account when deriving the low energy action in explicit microscopic models . ]    finally , we note that increasing the number of hidden u(1 ) s does not bring in hypercharge  portal interactions with a new structure ,",
    "so our considerations apply quite generally .",
    "in this section we derive constraints on the coupling constant @xmath28 from various laboratory experiments as well as unitarity considerations .",
    "the relevant interaction to leading order is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the photon and z - boson field strengths , respectively .",
    "in what follows , we set the kinetic mixing to be negligibly small such that the lighter of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 states is not detected and thus appears as missing energy and momentum .",
    "there are then two possibilities : the heavier state decays into the lighter state plus @xmath43 either outside or inside the detector .",
    "consider first the case where the mass splitting and @xmath28 are relatively small such that both @xmath41 and @xmath42 are `` invisible '' .",
    "the coupling @xmath27 involves longitudinal components of the massive vectors .",
    "therefore , some scattering amplitudes will grow indefinitely with energy , which imposes a cutoff on our effective theory . for a fixed cutoff ,",
    "this translates into a bound on @xmath28 .",
    "consider the scattering process @xmath44 at high energies , @xmath45 .",
    "the vertex can contain longitudinal components of at most one vector since @xmath46 .",
    "then one finds that the amplitude grows quadratically with energy , @xmath47 with the subscripts @xmath41 and @xmath42 applying to the processes involving longitudinal components of @xmath18 and @xmath12 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude can not exceed roughly @xmath48 . neglecting order one factors ,",
    "the resulting constraint is @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath30 is the cutoff scale . as explained in the previous section , @xmath30",
    "is associated with the mass scale of new states charged under @xmath51 . since constraints on such states",
    "are rather stringent , it is reasonable to take @xmath52 tev .",
    "this implies that light vector bosons can couple only very weakly , e.g. @xmath53 for @xmath54 mev .",
    "it is important to note that the unitarity bound applies irrespective of whether @xmath41 and @xmath42 are stable or not .",
    "thus it applies to the case @xmath55 or vice versa and also in the presence of the kinetic mixing .",
    "suppose that @xmath42 is the heavier state and the decay @xmath57 is not fast enough to occur inside the detector .",
    "then production of @xmath41 and @xmath42 would appear as missing energy .",
    "in particular , light @xmath58 can be produced in the invisible @xmath56 decay @xmath59 which is a powerful probe of new physics since its branching ratio in the standard model is small , about @xmath60 @xcite . in our case , this decay is dominated by the @xmath61channel annihilation through the photon , while the @xmath62contribution is suppressed by @xmath63 .",

    "the decay rate becomes @xmath72 taking @xmath73 gev , @xmath74 gev , @xmath75 gev and using the babar limit br@xmath76 at 90% cl @xcite , we find @xmath77 this bound applies to vector boson masses up to a few gev and disappears above @xmath78 .",
    "an analogous bound from @xmath79 is weaker .",
    "we note that the @xmath80 dependence is characteristic to production of the longitudinal components of massive vector bosons .",
    "the corresponding polarization vector grows with energy as @xmath81 , or in other words , at @xmath82 , the decay is dominated by the goldstone boson production , whose couplings grow with energy .",
    "thus , stronger constraints on @xmath28 are expected from the decay of heavier states .",
    "the corresponding bound from the radiative @xmath56 decay @xmath83 is much weaker .",
    "by @xmath41parity , such a decay can only be mediated by the @xmath62 boson , which brings in the @xmath63 suppression factor .",
    "the resulting constraint is negligible .",
    "the invisible width of the @xmath62 boson @xmath84 is strongly constrained by the lep measurements @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath85 contributes to @xmath84 for vector boson masses up to about 45 gev , thereby leading to a bound on @xmath28 .",
    "we find @xmath86 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath87 and @xmath71 , it becomes @xmath88 taking the bound on the bsm contribution to @xmath84 to be roughly 3 mev ( twice the experimental error  bar of @xmath84 @xcite ) , we have @xmath89 in the given kinematic range , this constraint is even stronger than the unitarity bound for @xmath90 tev and comparable to the latter with a multi  tev cutoff . as explained above , such sensitivity of @xmath91 to @xmath28 is due to the @xmath81 enhancement of the longitudinal vector boson production .",
    "flavor changing transitions with missing energy are also a sensitive probe of matter couplings to `` invisible '' states ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the decay @xmath94 proceeds via the sm flavor violating @xmath95 and @xmath96 vertices with subsequent conversion of @xmath97 into @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "numerically , the process is dominated by the @xmath62 contribution with the flavor changing vertex @xcite @xmath98 with @xmath99 where @xmath100 are the ckm matrix elements and @xmath101 is the inami  lim function @xcite , @xmath102 we find @xmath103 \\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the form factor @xmath104 is defined by @xmath105 with @xmath106 .",
    "the decay rate is dominated by the contribution from large invariant masses of the @xmath58 pair due to the longitudinal vector boson production .",
    "this justifies the subleading character of the photon contribution : the corresponding dipole operator can be significant at low invariant masses due to the @xmath107 pole , as in the @xmath108 processes ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent summary ) .",
    "the relative size of various @xmath109 operators can be found in @xcite , and we find that the photon contribution is unimportant .",
    "the relevant experimental limit has been obtained by babar : br@xmath110 at 90% cl @xcite .",
    "then taking @xmath111 and using its @xmath61dependence from @xcite , we find @xmath112 for @xmath113 up to roughly 2 gev .",
    "the above considerations equally apply to the process @xmath114 , up to trivial substitutions .",
    "we find that the resulting bound is weak , @xmath115 .",
    "this stems from the @xmath116 behavior of the rate , which favors heavier mesons .    finally , the chern ",
    "simons coupling does not contribute to @xmath117 due to the @xmath118tensor contraction , so there is no bound from the @xmath119 decay .",
    "also , @xmath28 contributes to @xmath120 only at the two loop level such that the resulting bound is insignificant .    .",
    "the unitarity bound assumes @xmath90 tev . ]",
    "the summary of the bounds is shown in fig .",
    "[ kappabounds ] .",
    "we see that the most stringent limits are set by the @xmath62 invisible width and unitarity considerations .",
    "the latter has the advantage of not being limited by kinematics and places a tight bound on @xmath28 for vector masses up to about 100 gev .",
    "when the vector boson mass difference is not too small , the heavier particle , say @xmath42 , will decay inside the detector . in this case , the constraints on @xmath28 get somewhat modified .",
    "the decay width @xmath122 is given by @xmath123 assuming that the @xmath62emission is kinematically forbidden .",
    "given the velocity @xmath124 and lifetime @xmath125 , @xmath42 decays inside the detector if @xmath126 is less than the detector size @xmath127 , which we take to be @xmath128 m. in this case , @xmath28 is constrained by radiative decays with missing energy .",
    "consider the radiative decay @xmath129 .",
    "its branching ratio is constrained by babar : br@xmath130 for a 3body final state and @xmath131 up to about 3 gev @xcite . since br@xmath132 100% , this requires approximately @xmath133 which is the strongest bound on @xmath28 in the kinematic range @xmath134 gev .",
    "this bound applies for @xmath135 where we have made the approximation @xmath136 .",
    "for example , taking the maximal allowed @xmath28 consistent with ( [ ups - rad ] ) at @xmath137 gev , the decay occurs within the detector for @xmath138 mev .",
    "( however , since the experimental cut on the photon energy is 150 mev , @xmath139 close to this bound would not lead to a detectable signal . )    on the other hand , the bound on @xmath28 from the invisible @xmath62 width does not change even for decaying @xmath42 .",
    "the reason is that the invisible width is defined by subtracting the visible decay width into fermions @xmath140 from the total width @xmath141 measured via the energy dependence of the hadronic cross section @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath142 qualifies as `` invisible '' decay and we still have @xmath143 as long as the decay is kinematically allowed .",
    "finally , the unitarity bound @xmath144 remains intact as well .",
    "another constraint in the higher mass range @xmath145 gev is imposed by the lep monophoton searches @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "we find , however , that it is somewhat weaker than the unitarity bound for @xmath90 tev ( the same applies to @xmath147 ) .",

    ", some of the relevant lhc constraints will be discussed in the next section , while their comprehensive analysis requires a separate study .",

    "these apply to very light , up to @xmath149(mev ) , particles .",
    "in particular , the rate of energy loss in horizontal  branch stars sets stringent bounds on light particle emission in compton  like scattering @xmath150 .",
    "we find that this cross section in the non  relativistic limit scales approximately as @xmath151 , with @xmath152kev being the core temperature .",
