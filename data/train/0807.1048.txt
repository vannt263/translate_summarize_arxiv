    "the growing interest on the application of organic molecules for building nanoelectronic devices is motivated by several factors : conductance properties , self - assembly and molecular recognition properties .",
    "self - assembly of molecular building blocks into well - structured systems allows us to exclude physical manipulation during fabrication of nanosize devices .",
    "moreover , the structural damages of the electrical elements can be repaired without any physical contact using the molecular recognition .",
    "since the dna molecules satisfy all these requirements and , moreover , have been found to conduct charge , its application to developing a nanoscale molecular devices is quite promising .",
    "while pristine dna is not a good conductor , its conductivity can be greatly enhanced by suitably changing the environment , thereby rendering it an important element for the nanobio electronics @xcite .",
    "an important finding that the overlapping of @xmath0 orbitals of the stacked base pairs can create a @xmath0-pathway for charge migration in dna , has over the years inspired many research groups to investigate the electronic properties of this important biomolecule .",
    "two independent possible directions can be discerned from various experiments , reported as yet : the charge migration in dna @xcite and its conductivity @xcite .",
    "it is now more or less established that charge migration in dna occurs through superexchange tunneling and charge hopping @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental data related to dna conductivity remains unclear : dna molecules exhibit a wide range of behaviors , from insulator to metallic @xcite .",
    "only recently , this issue has received a new twist , i.e. , the humidity is recognized as an important factor controlling both dna conductivity @xcite and dna magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the dna conductivity can increase exponentially by up to 10@xmath2 times with rising humidity @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , participation of the dna molecule in charge transport was verified by the high resistance of the environment , which exceeds up to 100 times the resistance of dna itself .",
    "the origin of dna conductivity and its enhancement with humidity was not yet clearly understood .",
    "the current interpretation of this phenomena @xcite rests on the change of dna permittivity and therefore , the dna conductivity due to adsorption of the water molecules on the dna skeleton .    for dna conductivity ,",
    "the electronic interaction of the nearest - neighbor base pairs is the most important issue , that was extensively investigated by many research groups @xcite .",
    "the parameters thus obtained were subsequently used for simulations of the charge transfer in dna within different approaches , such as the tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite , the system of kinetic equations @xcite and the polaron model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , when the superexchange tunneling and hopping were taken as two main transfer mechanisms , the experimentally observed features for hole migration @xcite were indeed reproduced by the theories .",
    "however , these models fail to explain the diverse behaviors of dna conductivity observed in the experiments .    from our point of view",
    ", the inconsistency of theory and experiment on dna conductivity lies with the reported theoretical approaches , where the charge transfer parameters were evaluated via the quantum - chemistry methods _ in vacuum _",
    "moreover , most often this evaluation was performed for a single nucleobase in vacuum @xcite that disregards the significant shift of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) energies due to the interstrand interaction of the nucleobases participating in the pair formation @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the computed parameters and the experimental estimate is rather large .",
    "for example , the potential barrier for the charge transfer from g - c to a - t has been estimated theoretically to be @xmath3 ev @xcite , while the experimental value is 0.2 ev @xcite .",
    "application of the pure electrostatic model to account for the solvation effect @xcite has shown a decrease of this potential barrier from 0.7 ev to @xmath4 0.5 ev , still higher than the experimental value .",
    "therefore , it was suspected @xcite that interaction of dna with water contributes not only to the solvation effect but also by changing the nucleobase electronic properties due to their interactions with water .    of late several papers have reported quantum - chemical calculations of the electronic properties of dna surrounded by solvent molecules @xcite .",
    "we have shown earlier @xcite that the nucleobases link to water and interactions between them can change the symmetry of the occupied @xmath0 orbitals localized on the nucleobases , that significantly shifts their orbital energies .",
    "therefore , the potential barrier for hole migration from g - c to a - t pairs is decreased from 0.7 ev ( dehydrated pairs ) to 0.123 ( hydrated pairs ) .",
    "moreover , occurrence of unbound @xmath0 electrons was found to be a reason for an increase of dna conductivity with rising humidity @xcite .",
    "the unbound @xmath0 electrons result in breaking of @xmath0 bonds , that occurs because of redistribution of the electron density from the @xmath0 bonds toward the nitrogen atoms due to hydrogen bonding of nitrogen with water molecules .",
    "the increase of the charge transfer between two base pairs due to contribution of such unbound electrons ( up to 250 times @xcite ) thus found , is still much less than in the experiments @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the reason for the underestimation of the humidity effect lies in the fact that the dna geometry transformation from b to a forms with dehydration of dna is not taken into account .    in our present work",
    "we report on our investigation of the impact of humidity on the orbital interaction and charge transfer between two base pairs if they are stacked according to the structural parameters of b - dna and a - dna .",
    "the aspects of the orbital interaction of the unbound electrons are considered also for an explanation of the magnetic properties of the b - dna molecule , exhibiting the paramagnetic behavior in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations for the dna molecule placed into the  water box \" have shown that the nucleobases are able to make hydrogen bonding with the water molecules @xcite . for our investigation of the electronic properties of canonical base pairs for dehydration and hydration ,",
    "the optimized structures of the a - t and g - c base pairs without water molecules and the same structures connected by hydrogen bonds to the water molecules were constructed via the quantum - chemical methods . in the first stage",
    ", the geometries of the a - t and g - c base pairs were optimized in vacuum with the jaguar program @xcite .",
    "the becke3-lee - yang - parr functionals @xcite and the restricted basis set with polarization and diffuse functions 6 - 31++g * * were applied .",
    "next , the crystal structure of the hydrated dna base pairs were obtained by placing the water molecules close to the nucleobase atoms having the ability to make hydrogen bonding with the water molecules @xcite .",
    "the position of water molecules were optimized under the condition of frozen base pair geometries to save their planarity .",
    "the crystal structures of the hydrated ( a - t ) and ( g - c ) pairs thus obtained are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .        to build the poly - sequences such as ( a - t)@xmath5 and ( g - c)@xmath5 and also the mixed sequences ,",
    "the optimized geometries of the hydrated ( a - t ) and ( g - c ) base pairs were stacked using the parameters of b - dna and a - dna .",
    "the natural bond orbital ( nbo ) analysis @xcite for these structures was performed , based on the electron density calculated with the b3lyp/6 - 31++g * * functional , which was earlier found to be a better choice for this purpose @xcite .",
    "the application of the hf method for determination of the electron density distribution provides similar results as the nbo analysis @xcite except for weaker interaction of the natural bond orbitals .",
    "the @xmath6 eigenfunctions are the natural bond orbitals built within the nbo analysis based on the input atomic orbital basis set obtained from the dft .",
    "the advantage of the nbo analysis is that the pauli exclusion principle is applied not only at the inner nodes that preserve orthogonality of the two electrons in the same orbital , but also at the outer nodes preserving the interatomic orthogonality . within the nbo analysis @xcite the charge transfer between the nucleobases",
    "@xmath7 has been found as the sum of the @xmath8 charge transfer between the donor orbital @xmath6 belonging to one nucleobase to the acceptor orbital @xmath9 on another nucleobase as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the donor orbital occupancy , @xmath12 are the orbital energies , @xmath13 is the off - diagonal element .",
    "the charge occupancy transfer is considered for stabilizing the orbital interaction , i.e. when the second order interaction energy @xmath14 is characterized by the positive sign .",
    "the electronic coupling between the nucleobases has been estimated for the natural bond orbitals set as @xmath15 to estimate the @xmath16 charge transfer in the dna molecule , we took into account the charge exchange only between the @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "it is well known that charge transfer in dna occurs due to the overlapping of the @xmath0 orbitals of the nearest - neighbor nucleobases .",
    "the efficiency of charge transfer is determined by the coupling of these @xmath0 orbitals and the difference of their energies .",
    "thus , for two interacting base pairs , the transfer of a @xmath0 electron between stacked nucleobases is usually attributed to the interaction of homo and homo-1 orbitals ( located on purines ) and homo-2 and homo-3 ( located on pyrimidines ) .",
    "the more efficient charge transfer is expected for two molecular orbitals located on the purines .    in this section ,",
    "we analyze the interaction of the homo and homo-1 orbitals in the system of two stacked base pairs .",
    "the efficiency of such interactions directly depends on the location of the base pairs relating to each other .",
    "it is known that sufficiently wet dna is characterized by a b - form , while dehydration changes the geometry of the dna molecule to the a - form .",
    "the distinction of a- and b - forms lies mostly in the helical twist @xmath17 , which for a - dna is 32@xmath18 and for b - dna is 36@xmath18 , and in a dislocation of the base pairs from a helix axis @xmath19 , which for a - dna is 4.5 and for b - dna is -1.0 @xcite .",
    "these parameters are important to describe a location of a base pair in the system of the two stacked pairs .",
    "the rest of the parameters , such as base pair tilt @xmath20 and axial rise per nucleotide @xmath21 , which are linearly dependent on each other @xcite , do not significantly change this location .",
    "the geometry of the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequences , where base pairs are stacked with structural parameters of b - dna and a - dna , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . as the nucleobases in the b - form",
    "are located on top of each other ( the displacement from the helix axis @xmath19 is close to zero ) , the most important contribution to the base pair interaction comes from the intrastrand part . for the a - form",
    ", the dislocation of the base pair from the helix axis causes both the intra- and interstrand charge exchange between the nucleobases .",
    "here we study the influence of the base pair location in a system of two stacked base pairs , such as ( a - t)@xmath5 and ( g - c)@xmath5 sequences .",
    "the shift of the @xmath0-orbital energies due to the interaction between two stacked base pairs can be determined from @xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the @xmath0-orbital energies respectively before interaction and after interaction , @xmath26 is the intrinsic interaction integral and @xmath27 is the effective core potential .    in the system of ( a - t)@xmath5 and ( g - c)@xmath5 sequences",
    "the interaction of filled @xmath0 orbitals is repulsive and therefore , the base pairs tend to repeal each other @xcite .",
    "this process is dominant when filled orbitals are orthogonalized , i.e. when the tilt angle @xmath20=0@xmath18 and the twist angle @xmath17=0@xmath18 . in this case , because the wavefunctions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are interacting in such a way that their lobes of the same sign overlap ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 are orthogonal orbitals , i.e. _ in - phase _ interaction ) , this leads to a decrease of the charge occupancy transfer @xmath7 between the intrastrand nucleobases and the pauli repulsion becomes dominant .",
    "the result of such an interaction is a shift of the @xmath0-orbital energies @xmath30 and @xmath31 by @xmath32 , while the contribution of the @xmath33 term is approximately zero .",
    "the shift of the homo and homo-1 orbital energies after perturbation is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] for the ( a - t)@xmath5 sequence and in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] for the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequence . for a twist angle of 0@xmath18",
    "the @xmath34 wavefunctions are almost equally delocalized over two purines and the splitting of the homo and homo-1 orbitals is large @xmath35 .",
    "however , in the a- and b - dna molecule the pair bases are stacked with a helical twist and additionally they are shifted from the helix axis . therefore , the @xmath0 electron density of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 wavefunctions are shifted such that it destroys the wavefunction orthogonality and results in a rise of the intrastrand charge occupancy transfer @xmath7 between the stacked base pairs . depending on the efficiency of the charge occupancy transfer , which is determined by the orbital overlap @xmath36 and symmetry of the interacting orbitals , the orbital energies @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "can be significantly shifted in comparison to the orthogonal case ( see the case of @xmath17=0@xmath18 in figs .  [",
    "fig : fig3]  [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath0-electron clouds are shifted , the charge occupancy transfer is significant even when two orbitals @xmath28 and @xmath29 are in - phase ( see dehydrated b - dna in fig .  [ fig : fig4 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "therefore , for the b - dna and the a - dna , the wavefunctions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are strongly localized on one nucleobase and splitting of their homo and homo-1 orbitals is decreased relating to orthogonal case due to the contribution from the @xmath39 term in eqs .",
    "[ eq : three]  [ eq : four ] . in our earlier works @xcite , the humidity was found to change the electron density distribution and symmetry of the @xmath0 orbitals for the single g - c and a - t base pairs . here",
    ", we observe that for the ( a - t)@xmath5 and ( g - c)@xmath5 sequence in the b - form , hydration reverses the interaction of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 wavefunctions .",
    "for example , for the ( a - t)@xmath5 sequence , the hydration changes interaction from out - of - phase to in - phase , while for the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequence from in - phase to out - of - phase .",
    "for the a - dna the humidity changes the symmetry of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 wavefunctions as well , but preserve the type of their interaction , i.e. the interaction of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 wavefunctions always remains out - of - phase for the ( a - t)@xmath5 sequence and in - phase for the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequence .",
    "the symmetry of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 wavefunctions localized on purines shows an opposite behavior for the ( a - t)@xmath5 and ( g - c)@xmath5 sequences staked with parameters of the b- and a - forms .",
    "this was found to be a result of the interaction of purines with pyrimidine within the dna pairs . for two stacked dehydrated guanines ( g)@xmath5 and two stacked dehydrated adenines ( a)@xmath5 only out - of - phase interactions of their @xmath28 and @xmath29 wavefunctions corresponding to homo and homo-1 orbitals",
    "are observed for both a- and b - forms in dehydrated case .",
    "therefore , the stacked guanines and the adenines originally are characterized by the same symmetry of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 wavefunctions .",
    "their properties are changed due to the contribution of the pyrimidine bases participating in the base pair formation .",
    "thus , for the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequences , the contribution of the @xmath0 orbital symmetry from cytosine switch the interaction of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 wavefunctions to in - phase type , while the contribution of the @xmath0 orbital symmetry from thymine for the ( a - t)@xmath5 sequence do not provide such a phase reversal . similar to the occupied orbitals , the ( a - t)@xmath5 and ( g - c)@xmath5 sequences have shown the opposite type of interaction of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( lumos ) , such as lumo and lumo-1 .    we thus conclude that the transport properties of the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) will be quite different due to the difference of their electronic structures , namely due to different symmetry of their interacting homos and lumos .",
    "this implies that experimentally observed @xcite different properties of poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) molecules showing respectively the @xmath40-type and @xmath41-type conductance can be related to their intrinsic electronic properties .",
    "our next step is the quantitative characterization of the charge occupancy transfer between stacked base pairs performed with the nbo analysis for dna of b and a forms with different levels of humidity . for the hydrated ( a - t)@xmath5 and ( g - c)@xmath5 sequences in the b - form , the intrastrand interaction between the stacked pairs and interaction of the nucleobases with water molecules drastically change the electron density distribution and population of the @xmath0 orbitals over the base pairs . as a result ,",
    "the covalent structure of the nucleobases is converted to a structure with separated charge ( ionic ) , that has been obtained by the nbo analysis @xcite .",
    "in particular , for adenine and guanine the @xmath0 electron density between the @xmath42 and @xmath43 atoms is shifted .",
    "therefore , instead of a double bonding to the @xmath43 atom , the @xmath42 atom _ donates _ an electron to form a double bond with the @xmath44 atom , which contributes one @xmath0 electron from the lone pair .",
    "consequently , the @xmath43 atom has only three bonds and carries a negative charge ( one @xmath0 electron not locked up to the covalent bond ) , while the @xmath44 atom has four bonds ( one missing @xmath0 electron ) and carries a positive charge .",
    "the charge separation occurs for the cytosine in a similar manner , where the @xmath45 atom carries a negative charge and the @xmath46 atom carries a positive charge .",
    "interestingly , for the ( a - t)@xmath5 sequence , the adenines are converted to the ionic structure already for the dehydrated case , while thymine always has a covalent structure .",
    "the origin of this behavior is the low weighting of the covalent structure of adenine and the high weighting of thymine @xcite .",
    "the alteration of the double bond pattern due to conversion of the covalent structure to the structure with separated charges changes the orbital perturbation and the intrastrand charge occupancy transfer between the nucleobases within each base pair .",
    "therefore , the interaction of guanine and cytosine within the hydrated g - c pair ( @xmath20=0 ) is significantly increased in comparison to that for the dehydrated g - c pair .",
    "their interstrand interactions are enhanced because of the change of the covalent structure of guanine and cytosine to the ionic structure and consequently to lowering the energy gap between their @xmath0 orbitals . in the covalent structure of the dehydrated g - c pair",
    "the charge transfer ( @xmath47=0.00043  ) occurs mostly between the @xmath48 lone pair ( guanine ) and the @xmath49 orbital of the @xmath45-@xmath42 bond ( cytosine ) , where the energy gap is @xmath50 ev . in the structure with separated charge , the charge transfer occurs mostly between the lone pair of the @xmath48 atom ( guanine ) and unbound @xmath0 electron on the @xmath45 atom ( cytosine ) .",
    "the energy gap between them is decreased to @xmath51 ev and the amount of charge transfer is @xmath52=0.0054  .",
    "the electronic coupling between guanine and cytosine is estimated to be @xmath53=0.0065 ev for the hydrated case against @xmath54=0.0016 ev for the dehydrated . unlike in dry dna in wet dna",
    "the interstrand charge transfer within the g - c pair can actually make a large contribution to the dna transport properties because of a stronger electronic coupling between guanine and cytosine and a lower energy gap between them .",
    "the enhancement of the interaction of the thymine and adenine within a a - t pair due to hydration is found to be very small .    within the ionic structure of both guanine and adenine",
    ", the unbound @xmath0 electrons are localized on the @xmath43 atom .",
    "however , the participation of these @xmath0 electrons in the intrastrand charge transfer within the ( g - c)@xmath5 and ( a - t)@xmath5 sequences is completely different for these purines due to the symmetry of the interacting orbitals homo and homo-1 observed in the previous section ( in - phase and out - of - phase ) . for the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequence in b form , the @xmath28 and @xmath29 wavefunctions are out - of - phase and therefore , the charge transfer between two guanines is large because of the permitted direct charge exchange between the @xmath43 atoms ( @xmath55@xmath56 ) with participation of the unbound @xmath0 electrons .",
    "the overlap of these unbound electrons for the b - dna is significant ( the overlap matrix @xmath57 @xmath56=0.0245 ) and energy gap for transfer is rather small @xmath58 ev .",
    "all of these provide a charge occupancy transfer from one guanine to another with participation of the unbound electrons to be @xmath59@xmath56=0.145  , that is a dominant charge transfer channel for the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequence . because the unbound @xmath0 electrons on the @xmath43 atoms are strongly localized , their orbital overlapping is sensitive to the twist angle",
    ". therefore , the @xmath55@xmath56 charge transfer exist only in the confined range of twist angle from @xmath17=33@xmath18 to @xmath17=44@xmath18 .",
    "our computational results for the charge occupancy transfer between guanines and cytosines within the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequence are presented in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "dehydration of the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequence in b - form leads to a major decrease of the charge occupancy transfer and change of its trend as result of application of the symmetry rule ( see dehydrated b - dna in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "for the intrastrand cytosines in the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequences , the dominance of the @xmath45-@xmath60 @xmath61-@xmath62 interaction in the dehydrated case is switched to the prevalence of the @xmath45-@xmath63@xmath45-@xmath64 interaction in the hydrated case , that significantly increases the charge transfer between the hydrated bases .",

    "the consideration of the pauli exclusion principle for outer nodes ( interatomic orthogonality ) in the nbo analysis allows us to analyze the spin state of unbound electrons .",
    "originally , the phase of the interacting wavefunctions is taken from the standard calculation b3lyp/6 - 31++g * * within the restricted basis set . if the wavefunctions of the homo and homo-1 orbitals obtained within the dft method are in - phase , then the unbound electrons obtained within the nbo analysis are also in - phase ( see figures  [ fig : fig3 ] and  [ fig : fig4 ] ) , i.e. , paired with parallel spin . their natural orbitals are closer in energy because of absence of exchange repulsion term @xmath89 in the interaction energy of two electrons . for the two unbound electrons paired with anti - parallel spins ( out - of - phase interaction of homo wavefunctions )",
    "their orbital energy splitting is quite large .",
    "the energy diagram of the unbound electrons in the guanines within the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequence , in adenines within the ( a - t)@xmath5 sequence and in cytosines within the ( g - c)@xmath5 sequence are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] a ) , b ) and c ) respectively for hydrated sequences in b and a - forms .",
    "two stacked cytosines are found to be source of paramagnetic behavior because their paired unbound electrons have parallel spin , while for the stacked adenines and guanines the interaction of the unbound electrons largely depend on the dna geometry . however , the stacked adenines as are also expected to contribute to the b - dna paramagnetism .",
    "therefore , with regards to the diamagnetic and paramagnetic properties of dna , dry dna is expected to be always diamagnetic because of the absence of unbound electrons , while wet dna should be paramagnetic and the efficiency of paramagnetism is directly dependent on the dna sequences .",
    "the control of the spin of the unbound electrons by the magnetic field would open up real opportunities for using dna in spintronics @xcite .",
    "our findings that hydration of dna activates the occurrence of the unbound @xmath0 electrons , which can easily participate in conductance because of narrowing of the band gap to @xmath4 3.0 ev in comparison to @xmath4 8.0 ev for dehydrated dna , allow us to characterize the dna molecule as a narrow band gap semiconductor .",
    "the main factors enhancing the appearance of these unbound electrons are linking of the nucleobases with water molecules and intrastrand interactions between neighboring nucleobases . the main contribution to",
    "the conductivity comes from the intrastrand transfer of unbound @xmath0 electrons between purines because of quite strong overlapping of their orbitals ( @xmath85@xmath90 0.025 ) and a small energy gap @xmath91 ev .",
    "therefore , at room temperature sufficient hydration of dna can lead to an increase of the conductivity by up to 10@xmath1 times , but at low temperature the conductance properties of the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) sequences should be significantly different because of the orbital symmetry rule . as an example , because of the out - of - phase interaction of the wavefunction of the corresponding @xmath0 unbound electrons , the conductivity of the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) chain is expected to be much larger than that for the poly(da)-poly(dt ) structure , where these wavefunctions are in - phase",
    ". the pairing of the unbound @xmath0 electrons from the nearest - neighbor intrastrand bases within the hydrated dna chain can be with anti - parallel or parallel spins , that is a source of correspondent diamagnetic and paramagnetic behavior of dna in a magnetic field .",
