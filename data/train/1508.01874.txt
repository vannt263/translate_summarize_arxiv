    "the problem of galaxies and their structures formation is one of the objectives of modern extragalactic astronomy and cosmology .",
    "there are many scenarios of structure formation @xcite , which are still important .",
    "this is because the new scenarios are essentially the modifications of the old ones and can be classified according to the classical ones .",
    "revised and improved structure formation scenarios can be found in various papers @xcite . the crucial goal is to discriminate among different models of galaxies and their structures formation .",
    "the main controversy here is how galaxies acquire their angular moments , which yield subsequently the moments of galaxy clusters .",
    "presently the commonly accepted is spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic @xmath1cdm model of the universe . in such model ,",
    "the structures were formed from the primordial adiabatic , nearly scale invariant gaussian random fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the most popular galaxy formation scenario , so - called hierarchic clustering model @xcite is based on this assumption .",
    "the numerical simulations @xcite confirm that such mechanism could be realized in the universe . in this mechanism",
    ", the large scale structure can appear from bottom to up as a consequence of gravitational interactions between galaxies .",
    "this means that galaxies are formed at the beginning with subsequent merger into larger clusters ( structures ) . in this case , the galaxies spin angular momenta arise as a result of interaction with their neighbors .",
    "original version of this model claims that the initial orientation of galaxy spins should be random .",
    "however , it had been shown later , that hierarchic clustering model admits naturally so - called tidal torque mechanism . in this mechanism , galaxies have their angular momenta aligned due to the coupling between the protogalaxy region and surrounding structure .",
    "the galaxy rotation in this mechanism is due to tidal interaction between galaxies @xcite based on the ideas of @xcite .",
    "the review of tidal torque scenario is presented by @xcite .",
    "note that while originally the tidal torque mechanism considers completely random distribution of spin angular momenta of galaxies , it has been shown later that the local tidal shear tensor can cause a local alignment of their rotational axes @xcite . on the other hand , some authors like @xcite , still argue that there is misalignment of angular momenta in the hierarchical clustering model .",
    "different scenarios make different predictions concerning distribution of their angular momenta and especially about orientation of galaxies in structures ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "of course the final test of a given scenario is to compare its predictions with observations .",
    "it is possible to conclude that the observed variations in angular momentum represent simple but fundamental constraints for any model of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "the investigations of galaxies alignment show that it depends on the mass of the parent structure .",
    "generally , the groups of galaxies and the small galaxy clusters reveal almost no alignment , while we observe such alignment for rich galaxy clusters and superclusters . the alignment increases with mass of the structure @xcite .",
    "note that it is commonly agreed that there is no evidence for rotation of the groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "that implies that such structures do not rotate ( for example @xcite ) , see however @xcite for an opposite opinion . in this context ,",
    "especially important is the result of @xcite who examined the dispersions and velocity gradients in 899 abell clusters and found possible evidence for rotation in only six of them .",
    "thus any non - zero angular momentum in groups and clusters of galaxies should arise only from possible alignment of galaxy spins and stronger alignment mean larger angular momentum of such structures .",
    "the aim of the present work is the theoretical analysis of the influence of tidal interaction between objects like galaxies , their clusters as well as smooth halos on their gravitational field distribution . for that we use the statistical method of @xcite . to apply our result to observable quantities",
    ", we calculate the distribution function of the angular momenta .",
    "we do that for linear ( corresponding to @xcite approximation in displacement field ) and nonlinear regimes of fluctuation growth . as in our method , the parameters of galaxy ensemble like their masses , radii and volumes enter problem as parameters , our calculation permits to trace possible relation between angular momentum and mass ( richness ) of the galaxy clusters .",
    "the above statistical method reveals the fact , that in the stellar systems , the derived distribution function can not be gaussian but rather belongs to the family of so - called `` heavy - tailed distributions '' , see , e.g. , @xcite for details .",
    "moreover , choosing the cosmology on the base of corresponding friedmann equation , our result permits to trace the time evolution of the distribution function of angular momenta and its mean value @xmath2 . in our approach , we can also derive the well - known empirical relation between mean galaxy cluster moment @xmath2 and its mass @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we , based solely on the quadrupole ( tidal ) interaction potential between astronomical objects , calculate our universal ( i.e. independent on the details of lanrangian or eulerian spaces ) distribution function of gravitational fields @xmath5 . in the section 4 , on the base of the function @xmath5 , we calculate the distribution function of angular momenta @xmath6 both in the linear and nonlinear lagrangian approximation .",
    "we emphasize that as @xmath5 does not depend on the eulerian or lagrangian picture , it can be used to calculate the distribution of any quantity ( like momentum ) of the astronomical objects ( not only galaxy clusters but smooth component like halos as well ) in any ( linear or nonlinear ) regime of fluctuation growth .",
    "unfortunately , the spin angular momentum is known only for very few galaxies and structures .",
    "therefore , instead of the angular momentum by itself , the orientation of galaxies in each cluster is usually studied .",
    "this is the reason that here we are interested primarily in the absolute value of galaxies angular momenta .",
    "we represent a matter ( both luminous and dark ) as the newtonian self - gravitating fluid embedded in the universe obeying corresponding friedmann equation . to obtain the tidal ( i.e. shape distorting ) interaction between the astronomical objects , we ,",
    "similar to @xcite , perform the multipole expansion of the newtonian interaction potential between fluid elements .",
    "truncating this expansion on the quadrupole terms , in the spirit of the article @xcite , we write the hamiltonian ( total classical energy ) of interaction between galaxies in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gravitational constant , @xmath9 is the total mass of the ensemble , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the quadrupole moment of the @xmath12-th galaxy , @xmath13 is its mass , @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 is a relative separation between centres of galaxies and @xmath19 is their number .",
    "the expression for @xmath11 has the form @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a volume of @xmath12-th galaxy , @xmath22 is a density of its mass .",
    "note , that expression generalizes the two - particle result of ref .",
    "@xcite on the ensemble of @xmath19 objects , splitting the interactions between them in pairwise manner .",
    "such splitting is customary in condensed matter physics where the interacting many - body ensemble is represented by the sum of all possible pair interactions between particles @xmath12 and @xmath23 ( for example 123=12 + 13 + 23 ) , see ref . @xcite and references therein in the context of magnetic systems .",
    "the same procedure is also used in astronomy @xcite .",
    "the physics of the interaction is the following . under the influence of the interaction with other astronomical objects , the shape of a given @xmath12-th object changes , which inflicts the variation of its density field @xmath22 , eq . .",
    "as the objects are situated randomly and have random shapes , the mass @xmath13 and quadrupole moment @xmath11 of an object ( like galaxy , galaxy cluster or smooth component ) will vary randomly .",
    "this generates the random variations of the gravity field @xmath24 from these quadrupoles .",
    "latter field is a gradient of the potential ( divided by mass @xmath25 ) and has the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the unit vector in the direction of the radius - vector .",
    "as we can not solve the random many - body problem exactly , different approaches had been used for its approximate solution .",
    "the simplest approach in condensed matter physics is so - called mean field approximation , where the fluctuating ( electric , magnetic , elastic in condensed matter ) field , acting on the specific particle is substituted by some ensemble averaged , mean field , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this approach does not take into account the particle clustering ( i.e. two- , three- , four - particle cluster in the field of the rest of likewise clusters ) and is not suitable to describe the systems with disorder , which is also our case . in the disordered case",
    "the adequate approach is statistical method similar to that applied by chandrasekhar @xcite to describe the fluctuations of the force acting on a specific star from the rest of stellar system . in this method ,",
    "the distribution function of random gravitational field is introduced so that any observable quantity of an ensemble ( like orbital moment , energy etc ) can be expressed by averaging the corresponding single - particle quantity with the above distribution function , see refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , @xcite and references therein , where the statistical method had been applied to disordered solids .",
    "according to statistical method , very similar to that from chandrasekhar @xcite , the distribution function of random quadrupolar fields reads ( see @xcite and references therein ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 is dirac @xmath30 - function , @xmath31 is given by the expression and bar means the averaging over spatial ( and any other possible ) disorder .",
    "we note that the above statistical method has frequently been used to describe the physical properties of disordered solids like dielectrics @xcite and/or magnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of distribution function is as follows .",
    "if we do not have any randomness in the galaxies ensemble ( for instance , all galaxies are similar ) the distribution function is just delta - peak , centered in the corresponding field @xmath31 .",
    "if we have a disorder in a system , the averaging broadens this delta - peak , giving rise to `` bell - shaped '' continuous probability distribution . during this averaging the index @xmath12 will be `` swallowed '' as we average over the stellar ensemble .    to perform the prescribed averagings",
    ", we pass to the integral representation of dirac @xmath30 - function to obtain @xmath32    the explicit averaging in eq .",
    "is based on the fact that the mass and quadrupole moment of the galaxies in the volume @xmath33 obey the uniform distribution with probability density equal to @xmath34 .",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that the fluctuations of above galaxies parameters obey poisson distribution @xcite , see also @xcite for purely mathematical treatment of this question . in this case",
    "the averaging for single galaxy yields @xmath35_1=\\frac{1}{4\\pi v}\\int_ve^{-i{\\boldsymbol \\rho}{\\bf e}({\\bf r})}d^3r,\\ ] ] while for the @xmath19 galaxies ensemble the corresponding average equals to @xmath36 @xmath37_1^n$ ] , i.e. the single - galaxy average , raised to power @xmath19 @xcite",
    ".    we note here that the above averaging procedure implies that the astronomical objects are similar to each other .",
    "however , it can be shown ( see @xcite and references therein ) , that such approach takes into account the pair clusters of galaxies or other spatially disordered constituents in the systems other then stellar .",
    "the higher order clusters ( three , four etc objects ) can be taken into account along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite which would require to solve the chain of kinetic equations for @xmath38 etc bodies distribution functions . on the other hand ,",
    "since the above procedure accounts exactly for pair clusters , the many - body clusters can be considered by the splitting them into corresponding pairs .",
    "this means that our approach takes also the many - particle clustering into account .",
    "however , in the future , we are going to elaborate the above @xmath39 - bodies procedure and compare it to our present results .",
    "we have finally @xmath40^n \\equiv \\lim_{n\\to\\infty , v\\to \\infty}\\left[\\frac 1v \\int_v u({\\bf r})d^3r\\right]^n\\equiv \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\equiv \\lim_{n\\to\\infty , v\\to \\infty } \\left\\{1-\\frac 1v\\int_v \\biggl[1-u({\\bf r})\\biggr]d^3r\\right\\}^n=   \\lim_{n\\to\\infty }   \\left\\{1-\\frac nn\\int_v \\biggl[1-u({\\bf r})\\biggr]d^3r\\right\\}^n\\equiv \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\equiv \\exp\\biggl[-n\\int_v \\bigl[1-u({\\bf r})\\bigr]d^3r\\biggr],\\nonumber \\\\ & & u({\\bf r})\\equiv \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int e^{-i\\rho e\\cos \\theta } \\sin \\theta d\\theta d\\varphi=\\frac{\\sin \\rho e({\\bf r})}{\\rho e({\\bf r } ) } , \\label{star10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is given by eq . .",

    ", we obtain following expression for the distribution function @xmath46d^3r.\\ ] ] we see that @xmath47 is indeed the characteristic function for random gravitational fields distribution . note",
    "that the galaxy clustering can be better considered if we assume that the density of galaxies is not a constant but rather @xmath48 .",

    "one more way to consider the effects of clustering is to account for inhomogeneous distribution of masses ( and/or quadrupolar moments ) in the ensemble . this can be done along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the distribution function of masses @xmath52 had been introduced . in our case , however , the situation will be not that simple as we are dealing with more complicated object like quadrupole moment of an object . in the present publication we do not consider this effect especially in view that there is large ambiguity in determination of function @xmath52 from the astronomical observation data .",
    "however , we are going to incorporate the dependence @xmath52 in our consideration in future .",
    "we note here that distribution function @xmath53 is by no means gaussian",
    ". we will show that function does not admit gaussian limit so that for problem of interaction between gravitational quadrupoles ( and actually higher order terms like octupoles etc ) the distribution function of gravitational fields and angular momenta is never gaussian . to demonstrate that , we note that it had been shown earlier for condensed matter systems ( ferroelectrics in @xcite and magnetic semiconductors in @xcite ) that gaussian limit corresponds to large density @xmath54 of electric dipoles ( ferroelectrics ) or spins ( magnetic systems ) .",
    "it had also been shown by @xcite and @xcite that limit @xmath54 corresponds to small fourier variable @xmath43 in the equation .",
    "this means that to obtain the gaussian limit of the distribution function , we should expand its characteristic function @xmath47 in small @xmath43 . in first nonvanishing ( gaussian ) approximation in small @xmath43 this procedure yields @xmath55 to derive equation , we use the expansion @xmath56 , valid at @xmath57 . the explicit rewriting of with respect to yields @xmath58 where the last integral over @xmath59 is divergent at small @xmath59 .",
    "we note here that in the solids the gaussian limit exists ( i.e. the integral becomes convergent ) due to presence of short range terms @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is so - called correlation radius , defining the range of interaction ) in the interaction potential between dipoles or spins . as the exchange interaction between spins is always of short range , this feature is peculiar to magnetic systems , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this means that due to long - range quadrupole - quadrupole interaction between galaxies , @xmath62 , the distribution function of their fields and/or orbital moments ( see below ) is never gaussian .",

    "it is seen that functions @xmath195 , related to the second perturbative corrections , are negative .",
    "substitution of such function into the exponent of integrand generates the imaginary part , which does not change the behaviour of @xmath196 qualitatively .",
    "that is why for the purpose of comparison of the linear and nonlinear regimes of fluctuation growth , everywhere we use the moduli of the functions @xmath195 both in cdm and in @xmath1cdm models .",
    "the dependences @xmath196 for einstein - de sitter cdm model with above @xmath182 are shown in the fig .",
    "it is seen that at time growth the distribution function diminishes , while at zero time it goes to infinity . as time ( figures near curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) grows , the maximum @xmath197 shifts towards larger @xmath178 so that the whole distribution function `` blurs '' at large times .",
    "this is related to the fact that functions @xmath182 enter the exponent in the integrand . the comparison of left and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show that the behaviour of @xmath196 is qualitatively similar in linear and nonlinear regimes of fluctuation growth .",
    "this means that for qualitative analysis we may safely use the linear regime . to further demonstrate that , at the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we report the dependence @xmath197 . it is seen that both in linear and nonlinear regime this function grows with time , although in @xmath1cdm model this growth is much faster so that to show both cdm and @xmath1cdm curves in one panel , we use the logarithmic scale .",
    "the result of numerical calculations in @xmath1cdm model are reported in fig .",
    "it is seen that qualitative behavior of @xmath196 is similar to that for cdm model . here",
    ", however , we can trace the variation of @xmath196 with parameter @xmath101 .",
    "it is seen that as parameter @xmath101 increases , the distribution function decreases - for the similar times the distribution function is smaller for larger @xmath101 .",
    "similar to cdm model , the maximum of distribution function shifts towards larger @xmath178 at time growth .",
    "the above regularities are the same for linear and nonlinear regimes , while the values of distribution functions in @xmath1cdm model for the same @xmath101 are smaller in nonlinear regime .",
    "this is related to the fact that function @xmath195 grows much faster then @xmath198 in @xmath1cdm model . also ,",
    "as has been noticed in many references ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , that first order perturbation result ( linear regime ) corresponds to so - called zeldovich approximation which is approximately valid also for nonlinear situation .",
    "this shows once more that for qualitative discussion of the time dependence of the distribution function @xmath199 we can safely use the linear approximation , based on the function @xmath198 only .",
    "it should be noted that parameter @xmath118 in eq .",
    "is of order of the hubble time @xmath200 .",
    "the comparison of the curves for different @xmath154 in the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that the relaxation time is very long .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that clusters are known to be dynamically young objects , i.e. with crossing timescales which are non negligible with respect to the age of the universe at the time of their formation .",
    "the fact that the relaxation time in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is very long suggests that the dependence of the effective 1d distribution function @xmath196 ( and average angular momentum as the result ) on the redshift should be weak .",
    "also , the comparison of figs [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] shows that the distribution of spin parameters of galaxy clusters depends on the cosmological parameters and generally speaking is weak .",
    "our theoretical results about the distribution function of momenta can shed some light on the problem of galaxies orientation in clusters .",
    "our main message is that although the gravitational interaction between galaxies is of long - range character , the observations ( which we will discuss below ) may evidence that there is additional short - range intergalaxy interaction with characteristic radius @xmath61 .",
    "this means that if the distance @xmath59 between two galaxies is smaller then @xmath61 , they are correlated and have their orbital moments aligned .",
    "this is the case for the dense ( rich ) galaxy clusters , which , by this virtue , have high degree of orbital moments alignment . in the opposite situation of poor clusters , where the intergalaxy distance @xmath201 , the long - range multipole interaction of alternating sign dominates and the alignment of the orbital moments is absent .",
    "we speculate that this situation resembles that in diluted magnetic systems , where the presence of short - range exchange interaction between magnetic spins promote long - range magnetic order , which is characterized by macroscopic spin alignment , see @xcite and references therein for details .",
    "the aforementioned statistical method permits to account for this situation if we add the ( empirical ) short - range interaction term to the initial potential . in this case , the distribution function of random fields would depend on the above average value of angular momentum @xmath202 as a parameter ( see @xcite ) so that self - consistent equation for @xmath203 of the form @xmath204 can be derived .",
    "here @xmath205 is the distribution function of random gravitational fields , which substitutes the expression in the case of inclusion of the possible short - range interaction term . in such case , for finite @xmath61",
    ", the distribution function decays at @xmath206 faster then so that the integral converges . as",
    "now the total interaction potential includes both luminous and dark matter , the equation permits to address the question about alignment of sub - dominant galaxies , when most of cluster angular momentum is in the smooth dark matter halo component .",
    "observationally it is relatively easy to analyse the orientation of angular momenta in the luminous matter i.e. in real galaxies and their clusters . with dark matter ( sub )",
    "halos this is not so easy .",
    "one should not , however , forget , that there are relation between the properties of luminous and dark matter .",
    "the articles @xcite show clear observational evidence of relation between the dark matter halos and galaxies orientation , see however @xcite for opposite opinion .",
    "the assumption that angular momentum of the luminous matter traces that of the associated dark matter ( sub)-structures ( e.g. angular momentum totally aligned , one galaxy per sub - halo ) allows us to conclude that angular momentum alignment of galaxies give us information about similar alignment in dark matter .",
    "in other words , the properties of angular momentum of luminous matter ( like real galaxies ) give us information about those of dark matter ( sub)-structures .",
    "for luminous matter , it is possible to consider the relation between the angular momentum and the mass of a structure as based on the observational data @xcite .",
    "it is possible to investigate how this image varies with the mass of galaxy clusters , beginning with the simplest ones , i.e. galaxies pairs .",
    "these investigations show that their angular momentum originates mainly from the orbital motion of galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite examining a sample of 31 galaxy pairs , found that an `` anti alignment '' of these galaxies spins occurs .",
    "@xcite recognized a weak alignment in physical pairs of galaxies .",
    "alignment in pairs of spiral galaxies was also discerned by @xcite .",
    "intrinsic spin alignment in galaxies pairs has independently been confirmed by @xcite within their research on weak gravitational lensing , where it was necessary to estimate and remove the effects related to alignment of galaxy orientations",
    ". also the analysis of positions of the milky way s companions shows their non random distribution ( they are located perpendicularly to the milky way s disc ) , which can be regarded as their orbital alignment .",
    "galaxies within compact groups rotate on prolate orbits about the group s centre @xcite , which contributes to the system s total angular momentum .",
    "@xcite found , while @xcite confirmed it , that the companions of central red galaxies are aligned along their large axes .",
    "the similar result has been obtained by @xcite in the two papers about the ordering of satellites orbits around m31 theirs latest article @xcite also corroborates this result .",
    "thus it can be maintained that structures like galaxies and their companions , pairs and compact groups of galaxies have a non zero net angular momentum related mostly to their orbital motion .",
    "one should not forget , however , that situation is more complicated in more massive structures . as there is no evidence for rotation of the groups and clusters of galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is clear that angular momentum of such structures is related primarily to the alignment of constituents spins .",
    "we should note here that there are many ( seemingly contradictory ) observational results regarding the alignment ( or misalignment ) of galaxies angular momenta in the literature beginning with the paper of @xcite , who found an alignment in the galaxy orientations in the virgo and a2197 clusters .",
    "the evidence for alignment of galaxies belonging to the virgo cluster had been found by @xcite .",
    "non random galaxy orientation was found in very rich galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the alignment of galaxy planes was also found in a1689 @xcite .",
    "this result is important as a1689 is the most distant cluster where the alignment has been found till now .",
    "there are also contradictory results .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied orientation of galaxies within clusters and did not find any alignment .",
    "the same result has been obtained by @xcite in theinvestigations of three abell clusters of richness class zero . during studies of the isolatedabell groups",
    "@xcite , only a rudimentary alignment was found and related only to the brightest cluster members .",
    "the alignment has also not been found during analysis of tully s groups of galaxies belonging to the local supercluster @xcite .",
    "summarizing above observations of angular momenta misalignment , we can conclude that such misalignment had been obtained for less massive structures like group and poor galaxy clusters .    to check the hypothesis , that the alignment of galaxies angular momenta increases with the cluster richness , @xcite examined orientation of galaxies in clusters both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "the analysis of the spatial orientations of galaxies in the 247 optically selected rich abell clusters , having in the considered area at least 100 members has been performed by @xcite .",
    "the structures have been taken from the pf catalog @xcite .",
    "the statistical analysis , based on linear regression , permitted to conclude that cluster angular momenta increase with their numerousness .",
    "note however , that relatively small statistical sample of 247 clusters , analyzed by @xcite , does not give a possibility to discriminate between linear dependence tested by @xcite , the dependence @xmath207 ( @xcite ) and our result that mean angular momentum is proportional to @xmath208 ( stemming from @xmath171 ) .",
    "however , such detailed analysis would be possible if larger statistical sample of galaxy clusters is available .",
    "the above results show clearly that galaxy clusters have a non zero net angular momentum related mostly to their orbital motion . for more massive structures",
    "there is a lack of alignment of the orientation of galaxies for group and poor galaxy clusters , while there is evidence for alignment for the rich clusters of galaxies ( @xcite , see also @xcite for later improved analysis ) .",
    "it has been suggested that degree of alignment increase with clusters richness , and as a result the cluster angular momentum increases with its numerousness .",
    "here we emphasize once more that the equation , which depends parametrically on the clusters parameters ( like mass density @xmath43 and cluster density @xmath39 ) will give zero or nonzero solutions for @xmath203 ( corresponding to alignment or misalignment of galaxies angular momenta ) depending on the parameters values and cluster reachness in particular .",
    "now we present an alternative explanation of alignment and misalignment of galaxies angular momenta in rich and poor clusters respectively .",
    "namely , as rich galaxy clusters are less dynamically evolved objects , the galaxies constituting them , havent had time to reach the pericenter of their orbit in the cluster and retain the alignment imprinted by the larger scale environment in which the cluster is embedded . in other words , large scale filaments ( cosmic web ) feed ( reach )",
    "galaxy clusters along privileged directions , resulting in clusters being rather more prolate in shape than spherical .",
    "we begin with the paper of @xcite , who had shown that the galaxies orientation distribution in the abell 754 double cluster is nonrandom with galaxy planes being perpendicular to the main cluster plane .",
    "the above nonrandom orientation distribution had also been found in the abell 754 cluster @xcite , but the direction ( relatively to the main cluster plane ) of the observed galaxy ordering is perpendicular to that for abell 754 .",
    "the interpretation of above orientation difference has been presented by @xcite in terms of two different types of galaxy clusters : oblate and prolate .",
    "one more interpretation can be done on the base of tidal interaction scenario .",
    "namely , it has been observed by @xcite that in large scale structure the direction of angular momenta ( relatively to its main plane ) of constituting objects depends on the structure mass . the same result has been obtained by @xcite .",
    "the newest analysis @xcite ( based on the earlier studies of @xcite ) on the dark matter halos angular momentum orientation also confirm the above result .",
    "the studies of galaxies angular momenta ordering in large scale had been fulfilled by @xcite , who use the data from sloan digital sky survey catalog .",
    "they found that galaxies angular momenta align perpendicularly to the large scale structures planes .",
    "latter effect has not been observed for the structures with relatively small masses .",
    "these results agree well with the simulations of @xcite based on tidal interaction mechanism . @xcite",
    "have found that the spins of spiral galaxies in the cosmic web have tendency to align along the filaments axes , which has been interpreted as the `` fossil '' evidence of the effects of long - range tidal interactions .",
    "the other interesting problem is possible time evolution of galaxy clusters alignment .",
    "assuming einstein - de sitter model @xcite , on the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we report the time evolution of the function @xmath147 .",
    "it is interesting that at time growth the distribution function goes to zero .",
    "this means that older structures ( clusters ) should have more scattered observed values of angular momenta than younger ones . at the same time , equation shows that mean angular momentum of the clusters should increase in time .",
    "latter result is obtained in einstein - de sitter model but is still valid for any similar cosmological models .",
    "the predictions will be available to verify when we get better data concerning alignment in galaxy clusters .",
    "note however that even now we have observational results suggesting the possible evolution of alignment with redshift .",
    "there are for example the results of @xcite who found that the alignment profile of cluster galaxies drops faster at higher redshifts .",
    "the main physical result of the present paper is the calculation of the distribution function of the gravitational fields of astronomical objects like galaxies ensembles and smooth halos based solely on the tidal interaction between constituting elements .",
    "we show that for tidal ( quadrupolar ) interaction the distribution function can not be gaussian , its explicit form being presented by the equation .",
    "we emphasize here that derived distribution function of gravitational fields does not depend on the specific eulerian or lagrangian description of newtonian matter and thus can be used to calculate virtually any observable characteristic of stellar ensemble . as an example , we use the above distribution function to calculate the distribution of angular momenta . from the astronomical interpretation point of view , it is important that for particular cluster with richness @xmath39 we expect not a single value of angular momentum but the range of allowed values described by the probability function . as the distribution function slowly decays at infinity , its first moment",
    "does not exist because the corresponding integral is divergent . to calculate the mean value of angular momentum in this situation",
    ", we assume that the maximal value of distribution function @xmath167 gives the desired quantity .",
    "we note that such procedure is usual while dealing with so - called heavy - tailed distributions , see , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "as astronomical objects ( for instance galaxies ) masses , radii and number enter the equation as parameters , we were able to show that mean value of angular momentum @xmath167 for particular galaxy cluster of mass @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath209 , thus corroborating well - known ( see @xcite and references therein ) empirical result .",
    "our other result @xmath210 @xmath171 ( or @xmath208 , eq . ) has also its astronomical interpretation that larger ( richer ) clusters of galaxies have higher angular momentum , see also the discussion below . the observational discrimination between the dependences @xmath209 and @xmath208 would be possible when larger statistical sample of galaxy clusters will be available .",
    "the parametric time dependence of @xmath167 via functions @xmath119 and @xmath211 in einstein - de sitter model permits us to trace its time evolution .",
    "this shows that our approach to derivation of distribution function of galaxies angular momenta gives physically reasonable answers .",
    "we have also analyzed the time evolution of the distribution function .",
    "it is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and shows that the distribution function is flattening with time .",
    "the relation between angular momentum and mass of the structures has been extensively analysed theoretically @xcite , see @xcite for review .",
    "this relation has usually been presented empirically in the form @xmath207 . from the point of view of modern scenarios of galaxy and their structures formation , increasing of angular momentum with the cluster richness could be explained only in tidal torque scenario in the hierarchic clustering model @xcite and in li model @xcite .",
    "one should note however that the value of the universe rotation , required by @xcite , is too large as compared to the anisotropy found in cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "the increase of the galaxies angular momentum with mass of the structure was found observationally during analysis of the alignment of galaxies in clusters @xcite . since it is commonly agreed that groups and clusters of galaxies do not rotate @xcite , any possible nonzero angular momentum of such structures should arise only from possible alignment of galaxy spins and stronger alignment mean greater angular momentum of such structures .",
    "generally there is no evidence for a non zero angular momentum of galaxies or group and poor galaxy clusters , while we observe such alignment for rich clusters of galaxies and superclusters .",
    "we speculate that this phenomenon may occur due to some additional short - range interaction between galaxies such that in rich clusters the galaxies are correlated as they fall in the range of this interaction and hence have their angular moments aligned . in such situations",
    "there should be some critical richness @xmath212 , related to the interaction range @xmath61 such that only clusters of richness @xmath213 would have their spins aligned .",
    "we note here that such physical picture is common for disordered magnets and ferroelectrics , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we postpone the quantitative investigation of this interesting question for future publications . the above scenario can we applied to the problem of the possible merger of galaxies into larger objects . the corresponding results will also be published elsewhere .",
    "the problem of galaxies merger in a cluster is related to that of the role of much more massive central galaxy .",
    "this problem , in turn , is due to the fact of ( generally speaking random ) interaction between cluster members and dynamic evolution of the nearby ( to specific cluster member ) structures .",
    "the problem of dynamic evolution can be studied by the combined examination of mutual orientation of galaxies in clusters and binggeli effect @xcite .",
    "more specifically , this can be done by two methods .",
    "the first is binggeli effect studies , i.e. the investigation of relation between positions of great axes in groups or clusters of galaxies and directions towards their neighbors .",
    "the second one is the studies of mutual orientation of the brightest galaxy ( and other bright galaxies ) in a structure relatively to the position of cluster great axes or even examination of structure ellipticity redshift dependence , especially in the enlarged observational samples .",
    "the analysis of the differences between position angles of the tullys groups of galaxies belonging to the local supercluster shows @xcite that there exists the alignment of the line joining two brightest galaxies with both the position angle of the parent group and the direction toward virgo cluster center .",
    "this analysis reveals the following picture of the structure formation .",
    "two brightest ( most massive ) galaxies were formed firstly .",
    "they originated in the filamentary structure directed toward the center of the protocluster .",
    "this is the place where the virgo cluster center is located now .",
    "due to gravitational clustering , the groups were formed in such a manner that galaxies follow the line determined by the two brightest ( most massive ) objects .",
    "therefore , the alignment of the structure position angle and line joining two brightest galaxies is observed .",
    "the other groups were formed on the same or nearby filament .",
    "this shows the particular role played by the more massive ( brighter ) galaxies . in our future investigations",
    ", we will analyze the particular role played by the central ( most massive ) galaxies quantitatively .",
    "one should note that the theoretical and observational analysis of galaxies alignment in cluster is also very important from the point of view of weak gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "there are mutual influence of the orientation of galaxies and weak gravitational lensing .",
    "it should be pointed out as well that the examination of galaxies orientations is also meaningful due to one of the outcomes of the activity of gravitational lensing effect @xcite which is the alignment of the galaxies images . such alignment , in several mpc scale",
    "is also expected in case of cosmic shear existence .",
    "@xcite proved that at least in the scenario of tidal interactions , the effects of alignment can be distinguished from the effects of weak gravitational lensing . taking both of these effects into consideration ( in appropriate proportions )",
    "is of a paramount importance for mapping the mass distribution with weak lensing techniques , and vice versa : weak lensing induced shape deformations are important for studies of the intrinsic orientation of galaxies within structures",
    ". therefore weak - lensing studies will allow investigating mass distribution in clusters which is important for studies of dark matter in them .",
    "let us finally summarize the simplifying assumptions made in the above calculation of the distribution function .",
    "we assume that autocorrelation radius is constant and is the same for each cluster @xcite .",
    "also we treated cluster density as a parameter rather then a function of interobject ( intergalaxy ) distance .",
    "we note here that as time ( via the functions @xmath214 , calculated in cdm and @xmath1cdm models in linear and nonlinear fluctuation growth regimes ) enters the distribution function as a parameter , our approach is valid for any cosmological model - from conventional einstein - de sitter cdm @xcite to @xmath1cdm .",
    "most important simplification is to assume that all galaxy has equal masses . in the future studies we plan to consider more realistic situation , introducing @xmath48 , the real ( i.e. extracted from observational data ) galaxy mass distribution function and the short - range term in the potential of interaction between astronomical objects ( say galaxies and their clusters ) .",
    "such generalisations will require numerical calculations of the distribution function of gravitational fields and its mean value .",
    "we are grateful to anonymous referee , whose expertise helps us to improve our work substantially .",

    "<S> the essence of reduction is that we use the multipole ( up to quadrupole here ) expansion of newtonian potential so that all hydrodynamic , `` extended '' characteristics of an object like its density mass are `` integrated out '' giving its `` point - like '' characteristics like mass and quadrupole moment . in that sense we make no difference between galaxies and smooth components like halos . </S>",
