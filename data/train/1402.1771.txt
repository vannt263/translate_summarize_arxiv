    "understanding the evolution of galaxies and large scale structure remains a fundamental challenge in astrophysics .",
    "many ambitious galaxy surveys have been carried out to address this problem , but limited time on large telescopes results in a classic problem : sky coverage , depth , and spectral resolution ",
    "choose two .",
    "for example , the very - wide - area sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) provides a wealth of spectral information for galaxies over a cosmologically significant volume , but its modest depth limits the sdss to the relatively local , ` modern ' universe .",
    "conversely , the hubble ultra - deep field photometric survey probes deep into cosmic time  to the epoch of reionization , but only over a tiny volume whose small population of galaxies leads to large uncertainties on their physical properties . while the union of such surveys has begun to paint a coherent picture of galaxy growth , significant patches of blank canvas limit our ability to fully describe how environmental processes , the infall of gas that fuels star formation , galaxy mergers and acquisitions , and feedback , all shape the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time .",
    "the carnegie - spitzer - imacs survey ( csi ) has been designed to address one of the most dramatic and least understood features of galaxy evolution  the remarkably rapid decline in cosmic star formation since @xmath1 .",
    "it is during this extended epoch of galaxy maturation that galaxy groups and clusters have also emerged as a conspicuous feature of the landscape .",
    "the csi survey is uniquely able to link together the evolution of individual galaxies with these features of large - scale structure growth .    in our ambitious spectrophotometric redshift survey of distant galaxies , we strike a balance between the aforementioned three factors : ( 1 ) high completeness to moderate redshift ( @xmath11 ) , ( 2 ) spectral resolution intermediate between conventional photometric and spectroscopic surveys ( combining the efficiency of imaging surveys with a spectral resolution high enough to resolve large - scale structure and prominent emission - lines ) ; and ( 3 ) an unprecedented area of 15 deg@xmath2 for a @xmath12 survey .",
    "these give the csi survey a volume comparable to the sdss , with a selection method that efficiently traces stellar mass over 2/3 the age of the universe ( @xmath13 )  spanning the critical redshift range where cosmic star formation precipitously drops , and groups and clusters become prominent . as the redshift survey with the largest unbiased volume at @xmath14",
    ", csi will allow us to comprehensively address the interplay between environment , galaxy mass buildup , and star formation at these redshifts .",
    "the innovation of moving to low resolution for cosmologically interesting problems of galaxy evolution was instigated by the primus collaboration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they designed a low dispersion prism to perform an optically selected redshift survey of several legacy fields and have used their sample of 140,000 galaxies to constrain the evolution of galaxy stellar mass functions @xcite , and to study agn activity @xcite and it s relation to galaxy evolution @xcite .    in this , the sample definition and basic analysis paper of the csi survey ,",
    "we describe the design of the project , with particular focus on the flux limits of the selection , the data processing and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting with its attendant determination of redshifts and redshift errors .",
    "we apply our methodologies to the first batch of data in 5.3 degs@xmath2 of the swire xmm - lss field , and provide an overview of some basic properties of galaxies over the past 9 gyr , with an emphasis on the gains made by selecting galaxies by stellar mass instead of by their rest - frame uv light .",
    "any effective probe of galaxy assembly must sample a wide range of masses in order to trace evolutionary connections between large and small systems .",
    "the build - up of massive red sequence galaxies may be driven by mergers with sub-@xmath15 systems , so it is essential to trace evolution to masses below @xmath15 to mitigate against the differential growth of the high- and low - mass populations .",
    "this trade - off between depth and area noted above has led to a dichotomy in redshift surveys .",
    "narrow and deep programs , such as the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ; * ? ? ? * ) or the galaxy mass assembly ultra - deep spectroscopic survey ( gmass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could not cover enough volume to robustly sample the evolution of the high mass population at @xmath16 , while other surveys that have traded depth for area do not reach below @xmath15 with high fidelity .",
    "an old stellar population at @xmath14 with a stellar mass of @xmath17 corresponds to roughly @xmath8 mag and @xmath18 mag in the optical , as shown in figure [ fig : masslimits ] .",
    "the extreme optical faintness of such galaxies results in many of them being missed in optically - selected surveys despite their relatively high masses .",
    "for example , the selection limits for deep2 @xcite and primus @xcite are shown in this figure by the blue and green dashed lines , respectively . at @xmath19 these programs _ required _ galaxies to be extremely massive or have their optical light dominated by young stellar populations in order to be fall within the survey selection .",
    "at best it can be difficult to trace the evolution of the most massive galaxies with such surveys . at worst ,",
    "if not properly accounted for , the survey selection introduces biases and systematic effects .",
    "extremely deep optical limits can be taken as one valid approach to ameliorating this problem , with the side effect of an overwhelming number of low - mass star - forming dwarfs dominating one s source catalog .    , @xmath20 , and @xmath0 m as a function of redshift , for passively evolving stellar populations ( @xmath21 ) with stellar masses @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 at @xmath25 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the magnitude limits for deep2 @xcite and primus @xcite are drawn .",
    "such optical flux limits only cover the most massive passively evolving systems or those galaxies with young unattenuated stellar populations , biasing galaxy samples at early times .",
    "the shallow dependence of the @xmath0 m magnitude on redshift yields a selection with significantly less bias against old systems",
    ". the effective optical limit of csi , @xmath26 mag , is also shown .",
    "the dotted vertical lines show the redshifts below which the deep2 , primus , and csi samples are not biased against old galaxies with stellar masses @xmath27 .",
    "[ fig : masslimits],width=240 ]          the integrated light of all but the youngest stellar populations are dominated by light from the stellar giant branch , cool stars whose light output peaks in the near - ir .",
    "it has long been recognized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that this results in a @xmath28 m `` bump ''  a peak in bolometric luminosity  for galaxies with a wide range of star formation histories .",
    "indeed , as shown clearly in ( for example ) figure 1 of @xcite , this feature is nearly unchanging in @xcite models of stellar populations with mean ages 100 myr @xmath2910 gyr . put in other terms , the near - ir mass - to - light ratio , m / l@xmath30 changes slowly for all but the youngest stellar populations .",
    "the csi survey exploits the wide field and sensitivity of the _ spitzer space telescope _ with the _ infrared array camera _ ( _ irac _ ) to take advantage of this property of the integrated near - ir light from stellar populations in @xmath31 galaxies .",
    "combined with the insensitivity to internal and galactic extinction , selection at @xmath0 m closely mirrors selection by stellar mass .",
    "figure [ fig : masslimits ] directly compares the evolution of @xmath0 m magnitude with the optical @xmath32 and @xmath20 bands : the csi selection wavelength has a dependence on redshift that is much shallower than surveys selected in the optical .",
    "what slope remains for the csi selection function is an unavoidable _ k - correction _ : over the redshift range @xmath33 , the center of the @xmath0 m _ irac _ band corresponds to restframe wavelengths of @xmath34 , straddling the @xmath28 m `` bump '' of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) as it redshifts through the bandpass .",
    "thus massive galaxies exhibit a much flatter trend of observed magnitudes with redshift in the ir than in the optical , and this weaker dependence on galaxy mass afforded by @xmath0m - selection of the sample is a key feature of the csi survey . our goal has been to make a spectrophotometric survey to characterize galaxy populations and environments in an unbiased way down to a stellar mass of @xmath15 out to @xmath35 , and down to a stellar mass of @xmath23 out to @xmath36 .",
    "as can be read from figure [ fig : masslimits ] , a mass limit of @xmath15 corresponds to @xmath37 mag or @xmath26 mag at @xmath38 , and @xmath23 corresponds to @xmath37 mag or @xmath26 mag at @xmath36 .",
    "our current spectroscopic reduction and analysis , described below , is reaching an effective optical limit of @xmath26 mag ; brighter than this limit the csi spectroscopic sample is correctably complete ( though not necessarily uniformly complete ; see  [ subsec : success ] for more details ) .",
    "figure [ fig : masslimits_lim ] ( left ) plots the limiting mass as a function of redshift for csi ( solid orange ) and other redshift surveys .",
    "the depth of csi in stellar mass is substantially less sensitive to redshift compared to the others due to the _ irac _",
    "@xmath0 m selection , varying by a factor @xmath39 over @xmath40 , compared to @xmath41dex over the same redshift range for optically - selected surveys .",
    "consequently , csi samples a more uniform range of stellar masses over the full volume of the survey , and to a lookback time of 9 gyr .",
    "this critical point is illustrated in figure [ fig : masslimits_lim ] ( right ) , plotting the depth in stellar mass against the volume probed with complete , unbiased samples .",
    "deep2 , shown in violet ( the line colors are the same as in the left ) , is limited in both area and mass depth .",
    "primus s 9 degs@xmath2 is limited in depth , and thus only probes an unbiased volume comparable to our first 5 degs@xmath2 .",
    "when csi reaches its goal of 15 degs@xmath2 , the survey will cover an unbiased volume equal to the sdss with similar depth in stellar mass .",
    "the large areas available from legacy spitzer _ irac _ surveys  both wide _ and _ deep , and the freedom from foreground and internal extinction at this wavelength , allows the construction of uniformly deep , homogeneous photometric samples for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "csi reaches factors of 2 - 6 deeper than deep2 in mass , over an area ultimately 8 times wider , and redshifts sufficiently accurate to characterize environments by directly identifying groups and clusters . with such data we aim to make the first group catalog at @xmath14 that is comparable in limiting mass and volume to sdss , and thus enable detailed environmental characterizations of galaxies at a time when the universe was less than half its current age .    in this first paper",
    ", we describe the details of our data reduction and redshift fitting , redshifts for the first 45,284 galaxies in 5.3 degs@xmath2 of the swire - xmm field ( figure [ fig : xmmfield ] ) , and an initial characterization of the general galaxy populations in our stellar mass - limited sample .",
    "a project of this type and scope requires attention to detail and care in the processing and combination of a broad range of data from different sources . in this section",
    "we describe the imaging data and reductions that underpin the broadband flux measurements for the sample , both for the ultimate goal of fitting seds , but also for defining the selection criteria and incompleteness functions .",
    "unless otherwise specified , all object detection was performed using sextractor @xcite .",
    "the swire legacy survey @xcite observed several large fields with _",
    "irac _ to a depth suitable for our survey .",
    "three of these fields are accessible from southern telescopes , providing up to 23.8 deg@xmath2 of coverage at @xmath0 m .",
    "basic properties of the three fields are given in table [ tab : fields ] .",
    "of these fields , @xmath42 deg@xmath43 have supplemental optical imaging that is publicly available .",
    "of the 9.1 degs@xmath2 of _ irac _ imaging in the xmm - lss field , 6.9 degs@xmath2 is covered by the cfht legacy survey w1 @xmath44 imaging . in this section",
    "we discuss our analysis of the swire xmm - lss _ irac _ data , our reprocessing of the cfhtlsw1 @xmath44 imaging and subsequent photometry of the @xmath0 m catalog , as well as our observations at @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the field using newfirm @xcite on the mayall 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the swire legacy survey was a program undertaken to trace galaxies by stellar mass back to @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we obtained the _ irac _ images of the xmm - lss field from the archive at ipac . the reductions and processing of these data",
    "were described by @xcite . in order to minimize contamination of the object catalog by artifacts around stars",

    "a ` mexican hat ' convolution kernel was used for object detection , resulting in 585,159 objects in the @xmath0 m catalog of the xmm - lss field .",

    "the `` wide '' w1 field provided almost 7 deg@xmath43 of overlapping @xmath44 coverage in the swire xmm - lss field .",
    "unfortunately , the processed images and catalogs available at terapix were not entirely suitable for our purposes , owing to uncertain astrometry and inadequate defringing of the @xmath20 and @xmath49 data . to remedy this issue",
    ", we obtained the complete set of calibrated frames from the cfht archive and processed the data using the following additional steps .",
    "we begin by constructing new fringe frames in @xmath20 and @xmath49 by medianing scaled exposures obtained within a single night .",
    "these were then rescaled and subtracted from the individual exposures .",
    "some bright objects did bias these medians when the number of exposures was small ( i.e. @xmath50 ) , leaving faint traces in the resulting fringe frames . in general , however , the greater sky uniformity after subtraction of these new fringe frames improved the depth of our resulting catalogs by @xmath51 to @xmath52 mag compared to the terapix catalogs .",
    "we constructed sky frames as well for the @xmath53 , and @xmath32 bands using a similar methodology , though not restricting the construction to data collected within single nights .",
    "new astrometric solutions were derived for each exposure using the _ irac _ catalog as a set of deep astrometric standards .",
    "cubic solutions for each chip were derived with a typical rms scatter of 015 . for those regions of the megacam images that did not overlap the swire data , we supplemented the catalog with the 2mass point source catalog @xcite , in order to prevent the solutions from diverging at the edges of the _ irac _ field .    using these new astrometric solutions , and the photometric solutions from the headers of the individual frames , we constructed cosmic - ray - cleaned image stacks with 0185 pixels , 30 arcmin on a side and evenly spaced .",
    "these smaller images were more easily managed than the larger image formats provided by terapix , which allowed us to distribute the image analysis and photometry tasks over multiple processors .",
    "the zeropoints were checked by comparing the photometry of moderately bright objects with the data in the catalogs from terapix and we found systematic offsets less than @xmath54 mag in every case .",
    "object catalogs were generated using sextractor , and these were matched to the _ irac _ catalog with a tolerance of 15 arcsec , with the goal of using the optical image characteristics to aid in star / galaxy separation , and to determine which _",
    "irac_-selected objects have centroids with optical centers falling far from the defined slit positions .",
    "newfirm @xcite is a wide - field ( @xmath55 ) near - ir camera deployed by noao at the mayall 4 m at kitt peak from 2007 to early 2010 . during the fall semesters we imaged the xmm - lss field in @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "typical exposure times were 70 min / pixel in @xmath45 and 32 min / pixel in @xmath46 .",
    "the seeing ranged between @xmath56 arcsec ( fwhm ) .",
    "the data were processed using a fully automated , custom pipeline , written as a prototype for a wide - field imager being deployed at magellan .",
    "the basic steps in the reduction were : ( 1 ) subtraction of the dark current ; ( 2 ) correction for nonlinearity ; ( 3 ) division by a flat - field ; ( 4 ) masking of known bad pixels ; ( 5 ) construction of first - pass sky frames ; ( 6 ) derivation of image shifts , in arcsec , on the sky ; ( 7 ) stacking of the first - pass sky - subtracted frames ; ( 8) generation of a deep object catalog ; ( 9 ) construction of object and persistence masks for second - pass sky estimation ; ( 10 ) temporary interpolation over objects , persistence , and bad pixels for each frame ; ( 11 ) constructing bivariate wavelet transforms of these masked frames ; ( 12 ) fitting the time variation of the wavelet transforms of the sky using shorter frequencies for larger spatial scales ; ( 13 ) reconstruction of model sky frames by inverting the temporally smoothed wavelet transforms ; ( 14 ) subtraction of the model sky frames ; ( 15 ) re - derivation of image shifts , in arcsec , on the sky ; ( 16 ) final stacking of the sky - subtracted frames , including the generation of sigma and exposure maps ; ( 17 ) identification of objects in the 2mass point source catalog , restricted by 2mass psc quality flags ; ( 18 ) application of rotation , translation , and scale to the camera distortion based on the 2mass objects ; and ( 19 ) calculation of image zero - points using the 2mass objects .    using the zeropoints of each image , we constructed image mosaics @xmath57 on a side centered at the locations of our @xmath44 mosaics , but with 04 pixels .      magnitudes in @xmath58 were derived using aperture photometry within a range of circular apertures for the entire swire catalog . because the seeing varied with wavelength and pointing , we convolved the @xmath49-band image stacks ( which had the best psfs on average ) with gaussians to simulate the effects of poorer seeing in the @xmath59 data .",
    "the offsets in magnitude from the degraded @xmath49 images were applied as psf - corrections to the @xmath59 aperture magnitudes . while the details of the psf and potential blending are critical for small apertures and for modeling the profiles of the objects , our choice of fitting the seds to much larger - aperture ( @xmath60 ) magnitudes allows us to utilize a simple and economical approach to the psf corrections",
    " this choice was especially important given the enormous size of the object catalog .",
    "the choice of such a large aperture also reduces the systematic errors in matching the aperture magnitudes to the _ irac _ @xmath0 m fluxes .     from 7500  to 1@xmath61",
    "the eight layers are made from thin prisms of s - fpl51 and n - kzfs2 , to make a stack of glass 150 mm thick .",
    "this prism has a resolution with a mild dependence on wavelength ( see figure [ fig : resolution ] ) compared to the first prism deployed in imacs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : udpphoto],width=316 ]          while the concept of using a low - dispersion prism for galaxy evolution has origins in primus , the infrastructure and background work for csi s observing strategy and data reduction was largely developed during the first author s participation in the study of the @xmath62 cluster rxj015213 and the intervening field @xcite . between 2008 and 2009 the swire xmm field was targeted in 31 multislit mask exposures with the _ imacs _ f/2 camera configuration and the low dispersion prism ( ldp ) designed by s. burles for the primus redshift survey @xcite . in 2010",
    "we observed 29 swire xmm masks using an innovative eight - layer disperser called the uniform dispersion prism ( udp , see figure [ fig : udpphoto ] ) .",
    "although both of these dispersers produce spectra with median resolutions of @xmath63 , the dispersion curve of the udp is much flatter , providing significantly higher resolution than the ldp out to @xmath64 m , at the expense of marginally lower resolution in the blue compared to the ldp ( figure [ fig : resolution ] ) .",
    "previous work by the pi on a similar program had obtained adequate @xmath65 ratios with exposure times of 3 hours down to @xmath66 mag using less sensitive site detectors @xcite .",
    "significantly more sensitive e2v detectors were installed in imacs , thanks to support from the nsf s tsip program ( see dressler  2011 ) ; these ccds boosted the throughput of the instrument by factors of 2 - 3 in the far red .",
    "we observed with these detectors using the nod and shuffle mode of imacs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and accumulated exposure times of 2h per galaxy for more than 90% of the sample , using individual integrations with durations of 30 min ( 15 min per position ) .",
    "typical slit lengths were 5 arcsec , with slit widths of 1 arcsec .",
    "the positions of the slit masks are shown in figure [ fig : xmmfield ] .",
    "no blocking filter was necessary , as all of the light dispersed by prisms stays within a single order .",
    "spectrophotometric standards were obtained during most observing runs , with a consistency of 5% from run - to - run .",
    "helium calibration lamps illuminating the deployable flat - field screen were taken approximately every hour ( i.e. , every other science exposure ) . in this section",
    "we describe the basic steps involved in reducing the multislit prism data using the custom pipeline that had been written for the earlier cluster programs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two critical aspects of the reduction of ldp and udp data involve mapping wavelengths on the detector , and transposing between sky coordinates of objects and ccd coordinates .",
    "the small number of he lamp lines are insufficient for determining accurate wavelength solutions in individual slitlets , so we derive global wavelength mappings over an entire ccd using all of the slitlets simultaneously . thus , lines in a single spectrum that may be corrupted by bad columns or pixels will not affect the solution for that slitlet , as the @xmath67 helium lines over a ccd frame constrain the fit .",
    "the following are the basic , automated steps we have implemented in our pipeline :    * derive mapping of sky coordinates to ccd coordinates using an image of the slitmask ; * identify lines and fit 2d wavelength solutions using isolated helium lamp exposures on a chip - by - chip basis ; * refit new centroids for blended helium lines using nonlinear simultaneous gaussian fitting on a slit - by - slit basis ; * fit for improved mapping of 2d wavelength solutions ; * shift the wavelength maps using 2 - 3 night sky emission lines ( e.g. , [ o i ] 5577 , na 5890 , [ o i ] 6300 ) ;    we start with a distortion map for the camera , defined from previous exposures of the field around the globular cluster palomar 5 , to compute the approximate mapping of sky coordinates to ccd coordinates for the objects in the multislit mask .",
    "sextractor is run on a direct image of the slit mask and a simple pattern analysis matches up the predicted positions of the slits and the measured positions of the slits to create an adjusted mapping of sky coordinates to ccd coordinates .    with a theoretical dispersion curve for the prism ,",
    "we generate a trivariate mapping of sky coordinates to ccd coordinates that is wavelength dependent .",
    "sextractor is run on a helium comparison lamp image and the resulting catalog of the 3,000 to 4,000 helium lines is pattern - matched to the predicted positions of 8 unblended helium lines ( out of the 11 lines in our line list ) .",
    "new wavelength mappings are solved for as the order of the fit is gradually increased .",
    "the nearly final solutions generated at this stage are first order rescalings of the theoretical dispersion , with coefficients that are cubic polynomials of the sky coordinates .",
    "the typical rms at this stage is 0.3 - 0.4 pixels . with these solutions ,",
    "we can now generate predicted positions for the complete helium line list and fit gaussian profiles to the full line list for each slit . within each slit ,",
    "the gaussians are fit simultaneously , providing accurate positions for both the unblended and blended helium lines .",
    "using these new positions for the helium lines in ccd coordinates , we derive through iteration , the trivariate mapping between ccd coordinates and both wavelength and sky positions , with a typical final rms scatter of 0.25 pixels . for ldp data this scatter corresponds to @xmath68  at @xmath69 , or @xmath70",
    "this large uncertainty in the wavelength calibration in the far red for the ldp is due to the fact that its dispersion reaches @xmath71 / pixel at @xmath69 ; the scatter of @xmath72  introduces a 25% uncertainty in @xmath73 at such wavelengths when computing the flux calibration . because the resolution with the udp is @xmath74 higher at these red wavelengths , this additional source of uncertainty is negligible for those data .",
    "the final step involves cross - correlating simulated night sky emission lines ( [ oi]5577 , na i 5890 , and [ oi]6300 ) placed at their predicted positions with the spectra in the science frames , on a slit - by - slit basis .",
    "the median offset in both @xmath75 and @xmath76 is then applied to the wavelength mappings found from the nearest helium lamp exposure .      due to the unique nature of these prism data , the science frames must also be processed in a nonstandard fashion using custom written routines .",
    "we take particular care in the extraction of spectra because of the small number of pixels covered by each object , the faint optical limits we expect to probe , and the proximity of the objects to slit ends where residual sky counts can bias simple extraction algorithms .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : resolution ] ( top right ) , each object is exposed twice per readout . in our implementation of nod & shuffle ,",
    "the object positions are shifted by 1.6 arcsec between the two spectra , a and b. due to the fairly rapid timescale of the nodding ( typically 60s ) , the sky backgrounds in the a and b exposures are functionally identical , and the subtraction of the a and b two - dimensional spectra from each other should leave only the object remaining . however , while nod & shuffle does provide excellent sky subtraction , the galaxy spectra themselves still must be divided by a flat - field .",
    "flat - fielding data from nod & shuffle is also complicated by the fact that the a and b spectra were both exposed on identical detector pixels .",
    "thus the pixels in the flat - field defined by the position of the a spectrum should be used to flatten _ both _ the a and b spectra . to summarize the first two steps of our reductions , first subtract 2d spectrum a from 2d spectrum b , and b from a. next , divide the a - b spectrum and the b - a spectrum by those pixels in the ( normalized ) flat - field that were covered by spectrum a.",
    "a first attempt to extract 1d spectra for every object in an exposure involves a simple form of optimal extraction @xcite , in which each object is assumed to have a gaussian spatial profile .",
    "the centroid of the gaussian is defined as a low - order polynomial of wavelength , and this polynomial defines the initial trace of the object .",
    "the second moment of the gaussian is also computed as a low - order polynomial function of wavelength .",
    "then a rough 1d spectrum for a given object can be obtained using this gaussian approximation for the spatial profile in a manner similar to @xcite but we opt to solve for the 1d spectrum in a least - squares sense , representing it as a b - spline @xcite , and allowing us to downweight bad pixels , cosmic - rays , or other discrepant data . with this approximate spectrum ,",
    "we solve for new parameters of the spatial profile , including up to 4 hermite moments ( 10 for spectrophotometric flux standards ) , with each of these moments defined as low - order polynomial functions of wavelength .",
    "the wavelength binning of the b - spline is defined by the wavelength solution for each slitlet .    when these spatial profiles and object moments have been derived for all eight ccds of a given exposure",
    ", we analyze the differences between the predicted and measured object positions .",
    "these deviations are well described by a linear function of coordinates in the slitmask , largely reflecting the small misalignments of the mask that occurred when the observations were taken .",
    "we use this new linear function to fix the object positions , re - compute spatial profiles , and re - extract 1d spectra for each object in each exposure .    after deriving the traces and gauss - hermite moments of all the objects in all the exposures of a given slit mask",
    ", we perform a final optimal extraction using all of the exposures of a mask simultaneously .",
    "this procedure allows us to better flag ( and ignore ) cosmic - rays and other bad pixels , and to use the improved 1d spectrum of each object to further refine the spatial profiles and object positions . in this final extraction that combines all of the exposures , we incorporate the sensitivity function from our flux - calibration and produce spectra in physical units .",
    "pixels , now all converted to flux units , are weighted according to the inverse of the expected noise and bad columns and pixels flagged as discrepant are given zero weight .",
    "iteration allows us to flag and reject most cosmic rays , and to also re - weight the pixels using the `` least - power '' m - estimator ( see below ) in an effort to discount the noise estimates initially derived from the data frames .",
    "blindly using noise that has been estimated from the original frames can lead to subtle , small biases in the resulting spectra ; the iterative re - weighting helps mitigate the issue .",
    "the process performs an optimal extraction that yields a single 1d spectrum that matches all the data in a least - squares sense . while the exposure times are fairly uniform , the sky noise can vary greatly from exposure to exposure , especially as one approaches twilight or nearer to the moon .",
    "given the small differences between the wavelength solutions of the exposures , we sample the one - dimensional b - spline representation of the spectrum at a fixed set of wavelengths , defined by the dispersion of the prism at the center of the field .",
    "this fixed grid greatly simplifies the construction of templates for fitting the seds .",
    "spectra for objects repeatedly observed in overlapping slitmasks were not combined at this stage , but kept separate  for this paper  so that we could better assess data quality and empirically estimate our redshift precision .",
    "approximately 18% of the galaxies were repeated ; we discuss these below in the context of the redshifts and their uncertainties .",
    "approximately 20% of the objects observed with the ldp were also reobserved with the udp .",
    "accurate flux calibration is a critical component of the survey because spectral slopes provide additional information to constrain galaxy redshifts . for csi",
    "we choose bright hydrogen white dwarf standard stars with deep , broad balmer lines that can be detected with the ldp / udp .",
    "when taking a standard star spectrum , we place it in the center of an alignment star box on one of our slitmasks to ensure we are capturing essentially all of the star s flux .",
    "deep balmer lines are thus required since they allow us to refine the wavelength calibrations for the stars when they are not accurately centered in the boxes .",
    "the processing of standard star exposures is similar to that described above for the science exposures , with the following modifications . in order to derive the sensitivity function",
    ", we must first compensate for the fact that the seeing in the standard star exposure leads to different resolution than one would obtain with a narrow slit .",
    "we make an assumption that the seeing was isotropic and that the gauss - hermite parameterization of the spatial profile is a valid descriptor of the seeing profile in the dispersion direction . using this profile as a kernel , we deconvolve the extracted spectrum using an implementation of clean @xcite , convolving the result to a resolution equivalent to that defined by the science data ( fwhm=4.5 pixels ) .",
    "the wavelength calibration of the alignment star box is calculated with the trivariate wavelength solution of a helium lamp exposure obtained immediately after the standard star , with an additional correction from the measured positions of the star s balmer lines .    due to time and weather constraints ,",
    "spectrophotometric flux standards were not obtained during every night , but the excellent run - to - run repeatability of the relative flux calibration from 8500  to 4500  for the ldp ( and from 9000  to 4500  for the udp ) , of approximately @xmath77 allows us to use flux standards obtained on different nights or during different runs .",
    "we correct for slit losses , aperture corrections , and other such systematics as part of our sed fitting procedures , discussed in the next section .",
    "with broadband photometry and spectra in hand , a suitable library of template spectra can now be employed to estimate spectrophotometric redshifts . in this section",
    "we describe the basis functions in our templates , implement a generalized maximum likelihood method and estimate confidence limits for the redshifts of each galaxy along with several other parameters and properties .    here",
    "we discuss the construction of the templates , using several continuum components , each derived from the @xcite models .",
    "the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) was used , resulting in a median offset from `` diet '' salpeter imf ( bell & de jong 2001 ) of 0.04 dex for ssp ages up to about 9 gyr .",

    "can not be done _ a priori _ as it is one of the chief goals of the project .",
    "however , models of evolving stellar populations have been used for modeling low - dispersion prism data for the purpose of recovering redshifts to @xmath31 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "our method for csi echoes that approach , and we describe it here .",
    "our templates are constructed as the superposition of several continuum components and multiple emission lines .",
    "the stellar population bases were derived from the @xcite models , using the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) ratios of `` diet '' salpeter imfs ( bell & de jong 2001 ) for single stellar population ( spp ) ages up to about 9 gyr . ] . in building our templates",
    "we exploit the well known fact that for times @xmath78 gyr after the cessation of star formation , optical data no longer provide significant leverage on a galaxy s prior star formation history @xcite .",
    "we adopt a simple set of stellar population basis functions : these components are sensitive to different timescales of a galaxy s star formation history ; in combination , they reproduce the broad range of sed properties seen in normal galaxies .    the first base component is a constant star formation model with a starting epoch of @xmath79 .",
    "the time at which star formation ceases for this component is a free parameter in our analysis , a grid of values ranging from @xmath80 yr to @xmath81 yr prior to the redshift of observation ( capped at @xmath82 ) , whose values are spaced logarithmically with an interval of 0.10 dex .",
    "the metallicity of this base population is also gridded with values ranging from [ z / h]@xmath83 to [ z / h]@xmath84 , with an interval of 0.2 dex .",
    "redshift is the final gridded parameter , ranging from @xmath85 to @xmath86 at intervals of @xmath87 .",
    "superimposed on the base population are up to five piecewise constant sfr populations that formed in 200myr intervals centered on lookback times of @xmath88 yr , with the same metallicity as that of the base .",
    "four cartoon star formation histories built out of such components are schematized in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "the seds of each of these stellar components are redshifted , convolved to the wavelength - dependent resolution of the instrument , and sampled at the wavelengths appropriate for the galaxy spectra .",
    "lastly , extinctions of @xmath89 mag are applied to each component in an effort to reproduce the effects of complex dust distributions that are not well modeled by simple screen models .",
    "in addition to the continuum components , we include several emission line components : ( 1 ) a single unresolved gaussian emission line for [ oii]3727 , ( 2 ) a blend of three gaussians at [ oiii]5007 , [ oiii]4959 , and h@xmath90 , with ratios of @xmath91 , to broadly mimic the typical line ratios seen in galaxies at these masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( 3 ) a gaussian for h@xmath92 , and ( 4 ) an unresolved emission line for mgi2799 .",
    "because of the increasing uncertainties in the flux calibration of ldp data beyond 8000 , no emission lines were allowed beyond that point in those fits .",
    "given the higher quality of the udp data in the far red , we extended this limit to 9000  in fitting udp data , with the exception of [ oii]3727 , which we accepted to 9400 .",
    "these restrictions do not greatly affect the redshifts that are measured , but they do have some impact on the fit to the red continua of low redshift galaxies .",
    "note that the widths of the gaussian profiles are fixed to that defined by the spectral resolution .",
    "thus there are in total 24 stellar continuum components and 4 emission line components , each redshifted , convolved to the wavelength - dependent resolution of the instrument , and sampled at the wavelengths appropriate for the galaxy spectra .",
    "the broadband magnitudes of each component are computed using the filter transmission and detector qe curves of the respective imaging instruments .      before solving for the 28 coefficients at every location in the three - dimensional grid of redshift , metallicity , and termination time",
    ", we perform a step that solves for wavelength - dependent slit losses and aperture corrections , so that the imacs spectrum and broadband photometry can be fit together as a single sed .",
    "this rescaling of each imacs spectrum is derived using the broadband @xmath93 photometry from the 4 arcsec diameter apertures .",
    "performing this task on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis can be done accurately and robustly when the @xmath65 ratio of the photometry exceeds that of the spectroscopy , such as was done with deep suprimecam data in @xcite .",
    "but in csi , the cfhtls - w1 data has a 5-@xmath94 depth of @xmath95 mag , and fitting for a separate wavelength dependence for each galaxy is not robust .",
    "therefore we use the bright , red galaxies observed in a given mask to define a simple polynomial dependence for such slit losses and aperture corrections .",
    "the procedure is as follows : ( 1 ) construct a reduced set of templates , ( 2 ) fit these templates to the broadband fluxes of the bright , red galaxies , ( 3 ) derive rough photometric redshifts , ( 4 ) use these best - fit photometric templates to construct template prism spectra , and ( 5 ) ratio these prism templates with the observed prism spectra and fit low order polynomials .",
    "the resulting function is used for the wavelength dependence of the aperture corrections / slit losses for all objects within a given mask , allowing for a simple scaling of this polynomial for every galaxy to match the prism spectra with the broad - band photometry . at low",
    "redshift the adoption of a single polynomial to fix the flux calibration for an entire mask breaks down for large galaxies , contributing to some incompleteness at bright magnitudes .",
    "no significant correlations of the residuals from this fitting procedure are seen with respect to the positions of objects on the slit mask .",
    "standard least - squares and @xmath96 minimization techniques are susceptible to bad data points and outliers , for example , from a few residual cosmic rays or unidentified bad pixels , especially given the small number of usable pixels in each spectrum ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "we opted to perform an iteratively reweighted non - negative least squares fit for the template coefficients at each location in the grid , using the weight function of huber s m - estimator @xcite .",

    "the routine effectively minimized this m - estimator . by minimizing @xmath98 , instead of the @xmath104 m - estimator",
    ", the fitting produces a set of coefficients that are robust against outliers and contaminated data , so long as the fraction of bad pixels is @xmath105 .    using the rescaled imacs spectra and the @xmath58 photometry , we solve for the template coefficients using iteratively reweighted non - negative least squares .",
    "the coefficients for each galaxy are stored , as well as several m - estimators for each grid location , for use in the final likelihood analysis ( described below ) .",
    "each location in the three - dimensional grid of redshift , metallicity , and the termination of star - formation for the base ` constant - star - formation ' model has a dozen coefficients , as well as goodness of fit metrics . with these grids of population coefficients and m - estimators , confidence limits on all of the gridded parameters and derived properties , such as total masses , stellar masses , restframe colors ,",

    "* ) , were also very effective .",
    "we caution against using m - estimators that are insufficiently concave , as pixels `` contaminated '' by real ( but narrow ) features such as unresolved emission lines are attributed less weight than continuum pixels ( by definition ) . with these three dimensional likelihood functions",
    ", we have 24 sfh + 4 emission line parameters at each location in the grid .    for every spectrum",
    ", we marginalize over redshift , stellar mass , rest frame colors , stellar population parameters as per the components in the sed fitting , and emission line luminosities , estimating 68% , 90% and 95% confidence intervals for every parameter and property .",
    "several criteria are employed to define the sample that has successfully passed through the sed fitting , including sensible restframe colors and physically meaningful stellar masses .",
    "we also restrict the sample to the set of galaxies with formal 95% uncertainties in rest frame @xmath108 of @xmath109 mag ( equivalent to @xmath110 mag ) .",
    "the result is a relatively clean sample of 45,286 galaxies with a total of 55,490 spectra , over a field of 5.3 degs@xmath2 .",
    "we will use these confidence limits , along with data quality measures derived from additional m - estimators , to identify a high quality sample in the next sections .      assessing",
    "the quality of any data involves more than the estimation of @xmath65 ratios and calculations of reduced @xmath96  statistics that rest on simplistic or potentially unrealistic assumptions for the underlying sources of noise . in this section",
    "we investigate the distributions of residuals from the sed fitting using m - estimators and construct a new statistic to assess data quality . because they display varying degrees of sensitivity to outlying data points , comparisons of m - estimators directly probe how well the errors in the flux measurements have been estimated . because one s measurement uncertainties underpin any likelihood analysis , confidence in one s measurement errors translates directly to confidence in any confidence intervals . and",
    "while no simple combination of m - estimators will provide a complete description of the distribution and sources of bad data , the heuristic approach shown below provides important initial insights that we expect to push further as we complete the remainder of the survey .",
    "we first assume that on average the residuals from the maximum likelihood analysis reflect the true distribution of flux errors",
    ". the magnitude of these residuals , normalized by our estimated measurement errors , probes both the extent to which uncertainties have been improperly estimated and the extent to which bad pixels contaminate the data . recall that most likelihood analysis is of the form @xmath111 , with some limited analysis of @xmath96 .",
    "however , such work can only provide insight so long as @xmath112/\\sigma(\\lambda)$ ] is drawn from a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of unity .",
    "m - estimators have been designed to mitigate against specific non - gaussianities  long tails and sporadic spurious points  and such `` best fit '' solutions are significantly less biased by bad data .",
    "however , wholesale under- or over - estimation of measurement errors may remain an issue in one s data , and different m - estimators will reflect this to varying degrees .",
    "thus , ratios of m - estimators have the potential to become powerful tools for identifying galaxies in our sample that have been contaminated by spuriously bad pixels , have simply had their flux errors under - estimated due to poorly handled systematics , both intrinsic to the data or introduced in the reduction process , or have substantial systematic errors due to template mismatch or poor calibration ( e.g. flat - fielding ) .    for this analysis",
    "we introduce the `` fair '' and `` least - power '' m - estimators @xcite : @xmath113\\\\ l_{p}(x ) = & |x|^{1.2}/1.2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and use the ratio @xmath114 as a means to assess data quality .",
    "a higher ratio indicates that the formal errors have been underestimated .",
    "since this ratio does nt include @xmath115 , which was optimized in our sed fitting , the ratio @xmath114 provides a relatively independent check on the data quality .",
    "this statistic represents a helpful moment of the distribution of residuals from the sed fitting in a way that captures the extent to which the noise was properly accounted for .",
    "after all , the noise estimates underpin the shape of @xmath116 .    for a gaussian distribution of residuals , with perfect estimates for the measurement uncertainties , the ratio @xmath117 converges to @xmath118 . for",
    "a survey with many thousands of spectra with only 50 resolution elements , 68% of @xmath117 should fall between @xmath119 .",
    "for non - gaussian distributions the ratio increases .",
    "therefore , a finding of @xmath120 for a set of data indicates that the noise estimates were underestimated  though one does not know if the elevation in noise was due to contamination by spurious data or to a simple underestimate of the gaussian noise .",
    "but by using simple monte carlo experiments we calculate how this ratio is correlated with @xmath65 ratio under the assumption that a range of systematic measurement errors plague the data set . comparing the resulting trends with what is seen in the csi data",
    ", we can better understand how to divide the csi sample according to a quantitative assessment of data quality .",

    "the spectroscopic residuals from our sed fitting are not consistent with such simple underestimates of the errors in the imacs spectra .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mrat](b ) , we show models in which additional ( gaussian ) noise is added at levels of 1% , 2% , 5% , and 10% of an object s flux , with progressively thinner lines .",
    "these curves indicate that our data have additional sources of noise unaccounted for in our analysis that are typically at levels of a few percent or less .",
    "such levels may result from errors in flat - fielding or from a general mismatch of templates , for example .",
    "however , the additional sources of noise need not be uniformly distributed within each spectrum . in figure",
    "[ fig : mrat](c ) , we start with the 1% `` flat - fielding '' noise and contaminate 1 resolution element , with additional , localized noise at levels of 5% , 10% , and 25% of an object s flux in those pixels .",
    "while the permutations of such models may be infinite , the residuals in the csi data are reasonably well described by some combination of the estimated noise due to the sky , object , and detector electronics , _ plus _ flat - fielding errors at levels of @xmath123 , _ plus _ additional sources of bad pixels containing noise at levels of several percent .",
    "these trends should remind reader the combined sources of noise in the data are indeed non - gaussian , justifying our use of m - estimators in this maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "we now adopt the noise model shown in blue in figure [ fig : mrat](c ) as the baseline for defining spectroscopic data quality , since it effectively follows the lower boundary of the locus of points .",
    "we refer to the 50th percentile curve of this set of monte carlo simulations as @xmath124 , and use the 68% population interval , at fixed @xmath65 , to define the significance of a deviation from @xmath124 : @xmath125/\\sigma_{\\log m(s / n)}\\ ] ] at a given @xmath65 ratio , galaxies that lie far above @xmath124 either have problematic data or have severely underestimated flux uncertainties .",

    "depends on fits of template seds to flux measurements made over a ( hopefully ) wide baseline in wavelength .",

    "artifacts like poorly handled bad pixels , cosmic rays , improper fringe correction , and blending may similarly cause the sed fitting to fail for some fraction of spectroscopic targets .",

    "instead , the factors which contribute to incompleteness in csi more closely resemble those that affect broadband photometric surveys .",
    "the presence of , e.g. , strong [ oii]3727  can certainly lead to highly secure redshifts in some cases .",
    "however , the power of this survey comes with the ability to trace intermediate - width structure within the seds , such as the broad ca h&k absorption , the g band , or even the structure around the mgii absorption at restframe 2800  in older stellar populations .",
    "success for csi therefore depends on the quality of the photometry and the extracted 1d spectra , which jointly constitute our seds .",
    "having too low a s / n ratio in the imacs spectra is usually an issue at magnitudes fainter than i=23.5 , and at these flux levels the photometry is especially crucial .",

    "the distribution of inferred to total densities is asymmetric on the shortest scales and at the faintest magnitudes ; this is driven by small number statistics .",
    "essentially , when the inferred source density is zero , there may be two reasons : the true source density may , in fact , be zero , or there may be one or two galaxies present that were simply missed by the slitmasks or rejected by our quality cuts .",

    "there is a tail to low csi redshifts . at such low redshifts",
    "the @xmath188-band can be an important redshift discriminant and some of this tail is due to our use of m - estimators that reduce the weight of `` discrepant '' data points in fitting templates to the seds . when an @xmath32-band point is discrepant , the effect is minimal due to the wavelength coverage of the spectra .",

    "reproducing the potentially larger range of emission line luminosities ( with respect to the underlying stellar continuum properties ) at earlier epochs may be problematic .",
    "the allowed strength of [ oii]3727  line emission is important when the resolution is very low .",
    "galaxies with weak ( or no ) [ oii]3727  line emission and a balmer break indicative of intermediate age stars can sometimes be fit with templates that have [ oii]3727line emission blended with the 4000  break .",
    "this effect is similar to that seen in the low resolution spectroscopic study of a stars by @xcite , in which variable strengths of the lines in the balmer series can shift the apparent location of the break .",
    "we show example seds in figure [ fig : primus2 ] for galaxies at @xmath189 from the positive tail of the distribution of redshift differences between csi and primus , listing both redshifts and the reduced @xmath96 we obtain for our best - fit templates at the csi and primus redshifts .",
    "note that many of these galaxies have modest [ oii]3727  and intermediate age stellar populations .",
    "the wide baseline of broadband photometry used by csi helps constrain those stellar population components that define the 4000  and balmer breaks .",
    "we also take figures 20 and 21 of @xcite as confirmation that these tails to high csi redshifts are a reflection of these issues of resolution and feature strength . in those plots",
    ", @xcite shows that the primus redshift error distribution has a tail to negative redshift errors for galaxies at @xmath191 .",
    "we take the dependence of this tail on primus s quality flag ( and the dependence of the tail in figure [ fig : primus ] on the primus quality flag ) as suggestive that the tail is due to primus s systematic bias to low redshifts ( for galaxies of this particular spectral type ) .      because the data from individual slit masks were reduced independently ,",
    "repeat measurements can be compared .",
    "these comprise approximately 20% of the measured redshifts , providing a sample large enough to be analyzed as a function of galaxy properties , such as magnitude , color , stellar mass , or redshift . without prior constraints or measurements for the derived properties of these objects we adopt the mean of multiple measurements when plotting or analyzing the distributions as functions of redshift . in figure",
    "[ fig : repeats_z ] we plot the 68% fractional redshift differences against redshift , as well as @xmath0 m and @xmath20-band magnitudes . as a function of redshift",

    "as can be seen in the third panel , the width of the distribution is a stronger function of optical magnitude than near - ir magnitude because our sed fitting is dominated by the imacs spectroscopy .",
    "currently , we find @xmath198 at 22.6 mag @xmath199 23.6 mag , and @xmath200 at 23.6 mag @xmath201 24.6 mag .",
    "planned refinements in the pipeline are expected to improve the fidelity of the extracted spectra for such faint sources as our survey progresses .",
    "the redshift uncertainties are dissected further in figure [ fig : repeats_z2 ] by breaking up the sample into three redshift ranges and plotting against @xmath65 ratios of the imacs spectra , stellar mass , star formation activity , and rest frame @xmath202 color . from these panels",
    "it is evident that the redshift errors are not strongly correlated with spectral type or color , unlike the dependencies often seen in photometric redshifts .",
    "there is a rather small , subtle dependence on spectral type : quiescent galaxies ( those with a negligible specific star formation rate and hence strong balmer/4000  breaks ) and strongly star - forming galaxies have the greatest precision , while galaxies with modest or intermediate sfr have degraded redshift precision .",
    "weak [ oii]3727  emission at high redshift and observed at low resolution can appear blended with the 4000  break and produce spectra that are reasonably well fit by an sed with a balmer break and no [ oii]3727 .",
    "more specifically , [ oii]3727  is imperfectly correlated with the sfr inferred from the stellar continuum , leading to an additional uncertainty in the redshifts at the @xmath203 level in @xmath186 , depending on the @xmath65 ratio of the spectra , and even when not particularly statistically significant .",
    "this effect is substantially less pronounced for udp data , where the higher resolution of the disperser shifts the wavelength of such [ oii]3727  confusion farther to the red .",
    "this power of the higher resolution udp is illustrated in the last sed of figure [ fig : examples1 ] , in an old galaxy at @xmath204 with [ oii]3727  line emission ( likely a liner , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "again , this problem with low resolution spectroscopy is only important for `` green '' galaxies ; the bulk of the galaxy population , lying in the blue cloud and red sequence ( with strong [ oii]3727  and balmer breaks respectively ) , is unaffected .",
    "while the abundance of repeat spectroscopic measurements has allowed us to characterize the redshift uncertainties , repeated spectra of any given object are fine - tuned with the same broadband photometry as described in section [ subsec : fitting ] .",
    "for some galaxies this can in principle introduce artificially tight correlations between the repeat spectroscopic measurements .",
    "presumably , this issue becomes a serious problem only if the broad - band photometry is allowed to have greater weight in the likelihood analysis .",
    "this never occurs in our procedures because the number of data points in the udp and ldp spectra far exceed the number of photometric bands .",
    "even when the @xmath65 ratios of the spectra are low , binning these data over the photometric bandpasses yield @xmath65 ratios exceeding those of the broadband photometry for faint galaxies . however , since other factors ( e.g. , template selection ) may produce artificially consistent repeat measurements , in the following section we employ one more independent test of the redshift uncertainties .",
    "because galaxies largely exist in close pairs , in groups , in clusters , and in even larger coherent structures , all of which have velocity widths smaller than the redshift errors we expect in our data and analysis , the distribution of redshift errors can be inferred statistically from the distribution of pairwise redshift differences in a given sample .",
    "this technique was first explored and described by @xcite in an effort to derive the redshift uncertainties in photometric galaxy surveys , where a lack of spectroscopic follow - up and limited templates can hamper one s ability to estimate uncertainties .",
    "any methodology relying explicitly on clustering requires dense spatial sampling in order to extract a strong signal from the pairwise velocity histograms . while photometric redshift surveys , by definition , result in the highest possible spatial sampling , the spatial sampling of csi is limited by slit collisions , limiting the number of galaxy pairs available to perform this analysis .",
    "we divided our sample into subsets based on @xmath20-band magnitude and redshift and constructed pairwise velocity histograms .",
    "for the subsamples based on magnitude , we used those galaxies brighter than a given bin as a reference set , since those galaxies on average have more precise redshifts .",
    "while @xcite chose to randomize the positions in their dataset to correct for close pairs that arise only in projection , we opted to randomize the galaxy velocities since our slit - placement constraints lead to nontrivial spatial dependencies .",
    "care was taken to properly normalize the histograms derived from the randomized distributions , as the number of galaxies in them , by definition , is too large by the number of galaxies within coherent velocity structures . because this number can not be precisely defined _ a priori _ , it must be deduced from the data  from the wings of the histograms .",
    "we made several realizations to reduce the poisson noise imposed by the randomization process .",
    ", width=192 ]        the pairwise velocity histograms were fit by gaussians and the resulting standard deviations as a function of magnitude are plotted in figure [ fig : quadricompare ] .",
    "overplotted in blue are the expectations using the 68% confidence limits from our redshift likelihood functions , which are consistent with the pairwise velocity histograms down to @xmath205 mag .",
    "we derived the black circles assuming that the 95% confidence limits better represent the true redshift error distribution . at faint optical magnitudes , the closer match of the black points with the red histogram reflects a shift from unimodal to bimodal redshift likelihood functions , where the 95% confidence limits probe both peaks while the 68% redshift confidence limits often do not fully encompass multiple peaks in bimodal ( or trimodal ) likelihood functions .",
    "the consistency demonstrated by the @xcite method , along with comparisons to other spectroscopic redshifts , has reinforced the validity of the redshift uncertainties derived from our generalized likelihood analysis down to faint magnitudes .",
    "for faint sources , even when bimodality of the likelihood functions becomes important , redshifts remain constrained on average to 0.05 or better in @xmath186 .",
    "this is consistent with the relative numbers of galaxies with redshift errors @xmath206 and errors @xmath181 in @xmath186 seen in ",
    "[ sec : specz ] .",
    "the striking agreement between the different methods of estimating redshift errors should be of general interest , since the @xcite method was in part devised to remedy the fact that photometric redshift surveys provide neither repeat measurements of a given galaxy nor high - resolution spectroscopy for most targets . since any spatially dense survey will provide repeat measurements of ( relatively ) cold cosmic structures , the @xcite methodology remains a valuable technique for any spatially dense spectroscopic or photometric redshift survey  any survey where one does not have repeat observations with which to characterize uncertainties empirically .",
    "based on these three methods , we conclude that our random redshift uncertainties have been reliably characterized , and also that systematic uncertainties appear to be minimal . in particular",
    "we stress that our redshift errors are not strongly dependent on relative star formation activity , spectral type , or color .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , redshift errors that are strongly correlated with spectral type will bias estimates of local galaxy density if care is not taken to ensure that velocity windows ( or line - of - sight linking lengths ) encompass both red and blue galaxies with equal probability .",
    "given csi s primary goal of characterizing galaxy properties as a function of environment , the relative insensitivity of our redshift errors on spectral type is a crucial point .",
    "we conclude our discussion of the survey by presenting a broad overview of the csi sample . using the sample directly with the completeness functions derived earlier",

    "given that most galaxies in virialized or massive groups ( or both ) are `` red and dead '' even at @xmath31 @xcite , the mass selection , high spectral coverage , and color - insensitive redshift accuracy of csi will all be critical elements in characterizing relatively poor groups at high redshift .",
    "subsequent csi analyses will also focus on , for example , agn and any connections to group and/or host galaxy properties , on differences between centrals and satellites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and on merger rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as functions of environment .",

    "<S> we describe the carnegie - spitzer - imacs ( csi ) survey , a wide - field , near - ir selected spectrophotometric redshift survey with the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) on magellan - baade . by defining a flux - limited sample of galaxies in spitzer _ irac _ @xmath0 m imaging of swire fields , the csi survey efficiently traces the stellar mass of average galaxies to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this first paper provides an overview of the survey selection , observations , processing of the photometry and spectrophotometry . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe the processing of the data : new methods of fitting synthetic templates of spectral energy distributions are used to derive redshifts , stellar masses , emission line luminosities , and coarse information on recent star - formation . our unique methodology for analyzing low - dispersion spectra taken with multilayer prisms in _ imacs </S>",
    "<S> _ , combined with panchromatic photometry from the ultraviolet to the ir , has yielded high quality redshifts for 43,347 galaxies in our first 5.3 degs@xmath2 of the swire xmm - lss field . </S>",
    "<S> we use three different approaches to estimate our redshift errors and find robust agreement . over the full range of @xmath0 m fluxes of our selection , </S>",
    "<S> we find typical redshift uncertainties of @xmath3 . in comparisons with previously published spectroscopic redshifts </S>",
    "<S> we find scatters of @xmath4 for galaxies at @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for galaxies at @xmath7 . for galaxies brighter and fainter than @xmath8 mag , we find @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> notably , our low - dispersion spectroscopy and analysis yields comparable redshift uncertainties and success rates for both red and blue galaxies , largely eliminating color - based systematics that can seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolution on environment . </S>"
