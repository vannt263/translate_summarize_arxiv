    "<S> we analyze entanglement generation between a pair of neutral two level atoms that are initially excited in a common electromagnetic vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocal correlations that appear due to the interaction with the field can become entanglement when the field state is known . </S>",
    "<S> we distinguish two different situations : in the first , the field remains in the vacuum state , and second two photons are present in the final state . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we study the dependence of the entanglement with time and interatomic distance , at ranges related with locality issues .     </S>",
    "<S> + as is well known , an atom @xmath0 can not become excited by a physical signal coming from other atom @xmath1 placed at a distance @xmath2 at a time @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this does not prevent the emergence of correlations between these two atoms at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when the final state of the field ( and/or atom @xmath1 ) is fixed , atom @xmath0 can become excited even when both atoms were initially ( at @xmath5 ) uncorrelated and the time elapsed was smaller than @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the specification of this final state is highly nonlocal and a finite excitation probability @xmath7 for atom @xmath0 at times @xmath8 earlier than @xmath6 does not imply causality violation but is an artifact of that nonlocality . as shown in @xcite , causality </S>",
    "<S> is fully restored after summing over all the accessible final states for atom @xmath1 and the electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> now only the state of @xmath0 is accounted for ; this is a local property , no wonder that @xmath9 for @xmath4 in this case . in the language of quantum information , </S>",
    "<S> the system is nonsignaling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the mere existence of correlations is not enough in order to send information between the parties : classical communication is always needed to transform entanglement into information .    due to the existence of these nonlocal correlations , the reduced state of the atoms at a time @xmath8 is a mixed classically correlated state , even for @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of a correlated state from an uncorrelated one only by local interactions could be blamed on the fact that the field vacuum is an entangled state between spacelike separated regions @xcite or on the finiteness of the feynman propagator for @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are at least two ways to obtain entanglement from these correlations : introducing a suitable time dependent coupling between the field and the atoms ( like in @xcite with a scalar field and two classical detectors ) or fixing the field state @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we will show new examples of the latter case : we will start with both atoms excited in the electromagnetic vacuum , and after a interaction time @xmath8 we will consider the following field states :    * no photons are present , * two photons are detected </S>",
    "<S> .    we shall study the dependence of the entanglement with @xmath8 and @xmath2 , both for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the wavelengths relevant in the interaction with the atoms , and the separation between them , are much longer than the atomic dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole approximation , appropriate to these conditions , permits the splitting of the system hamiltonian into two parts @xmath13 that are separately gauge invariant . </S>",
    "<S> the first part is the hamiltonian in the absence of interactions other than the potentials that keep @xmath1 and @xmath0 stable , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the second contains all the interaction of the atoms with the field @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electric displacement field , and @xmath17 is the electric dipole moment of atom @xmath18 , that we will take here as real and of equal magnitude for both atoms @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the excited and ground states of the atoms , respectively .    in what follows we choose a system given initially by the product state , latexmath:[$|\\,\\psi\\,\\rangle_0\\,=\\ ,    @xmath0 are in the excited state @xmath20 and the field in the vacuum state @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the system then evolves under the effect of the interaction during a lapse of time @xmath8 into a state : @xmath24 that , to order @xmath25 , can be given in the interaction picture as @xmath26 where @xmath27 being @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the time ordering operator and @xmath30 is a shorthand for the state of @xmath18 photons with definite momenta and polarizations , i.e. @xmath31 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the superscript signs in @xmath32 , to be defined in [ e ] below , are associated to the energy difference between the initial and final atomic states of each transition . among all the terms that contribute to the final state ( [ c ] ) </S>",
    "<S> only @xmath33 corresponds to interaction between both atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this would change at higher orders in @xmath25 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath34 describes intra - atomic radiative corrections , @xmath35 and @xmath36 single photon emission by one atom , and @xmath37 by both atoms , while @xmath38 corresponds to two photon emission by a single atom . in quantum optics , virtual terms like @xmath33 and @xmath38 which do not conserve energy and appear only at very short times , </S>",
    "<S> are usually neglected by the introduction of a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) . </S>",
    "<S> but here we are interested in the short time behavior , and therefore all the terms must be included , as in @xcite . actually , </S>",
    "<S> only when all these virtual effects are considered , it can be said properly that the probability of excitation of atom @xmath0 is completely independent of atom @xmath1 when @xmath39 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , in the dipole approximation the actions @xmath40 in ( [ d ] ) reduce to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the transition frequency , and we are neglecting atomic recoil . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e ] ) depends on the atomic properties @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and on the interaction time @xmath8 . in our calculations </S>",
    "<S> we will take @xmath45 2p transition in the hydrogen atom , consider @xmath46 , and analyze the cases @xmath47 near the time @xmath48 where one atom could begin to receive signals from the other .    </S>",
    "<S> given a definite field state @xmath49 the pair of atoms is in a projected pure two qubits state as shown in ( [ c ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will denote these states by @xmath50 , @xmath51 and will compute the concurrence @xmath52 @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 the largest of the eigenvalues @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) of @xmath57\\rho_{ab}^{(n)}$ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the case @xmath58 , where the field is in the vacuum state and , following ( [ c ] ) , the atoms are in the projected pure state @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the normalization , giving a concurrence @xmath61 the computation of @xmath34 and @xmath33 can be performed following the lines given in @xcite , where they were computed for the case of a initial atomic state @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider that the dipoles are parallel along the @xmath63 axis , while the atoms remain along the @xmath64 axis . under that conditions , using the dimensionless variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 : @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where : @xmath70\\label{j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath71 with the additional term @xmath72 for @xmath73 . </S>",

    "<S> 2 the concurrence is sketched as a function of @xmath63 for given values of @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the tiny values of the concurrence for the region @xmath84 ( which corresponds to @xmath71 ) , diminish as @xmath8 grows and will eventually vanish , since @xmath33 is a non - rwa term .     of the atomic state in the e.m . </S>",
    "<S> vacuum @xmath77 as a function of @xmath85 for @xmath86 6 ( solid line ) , 9 ( dashed line ) and 12 ( dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 amounts to @xmath84 in each case . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the case @xmath87 analyzed in @xcite , shows atom - atom correlations due to the uncertainty of the photon source . here </S>",
    "<S> , we will focus on the two photon case . </S>",
    "<S> the final atomic state @xmath88 , with @xmath89 , is in the same subspace as for @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization @xmath91 is @xmath92 like the expectation values @xmath38 , @xmath37 , so that all the coefficients in @xmath93 may be large . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , although the probability of attaining this state is small , the correlations are not . </S>",
    "<S> the concurrence is @xmath94 we find that : @xmath95 with @xmath96 and @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the primes account for the two single photons , i.e. @xmath98 . the quantities @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 have been computed in @xcite .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 we show @xmath105 in front of @xmath75 for given values of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath81 ( @xmath82 , i.e. the quantum optics regime ) , @xmath38 vanishes and the final atomic state would be the separable state @xmath106 , with zero concurrence . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is sizeable for @xmath71 , and could be maximized if a particular two photon state was detected @xcite .     of the atomic state with @xmath107 photons @xmath108 in front of @xmath109 for @xmath110 5 ( solid line ) , 10 ( dashed line ) and 15 ( dotted line).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig . 4 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath105 is sketched as a function of @xmath63 for given values of @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> again , the concurrence for the region @xmath84 ( @xmath71 ) , diminish as @xmath8 grows and will eventually vanish , since it is due to @xmath38 , which is a non - rwa term .     of the atomic state with @xmath107 photons @xmath108 in front of @xmath111 for @xmath112 6 ( solid line ) , 9 ( dashed line ) and 12 ( dotted line).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    interestingly , as we noted in @xcite for the single photon emission , @xmath76 is a singular point that divides the spacetime into two different regions . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs , as in @xcite , even if in these cases @xmath8 is not the propagation time of any physical signal between the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this effect comes from the appearance of effective interaction terms like @xmath113 , that would be missing if we could discriminate the source of emission of each photon .    </S>",
    "<S> as a summary , we have computed the concurrence generated between a pair of neutral two level atoms by the interaction with the electromagnetic field , in order to study the role of locality in the growing up of quantum correlations . we have considered the initial state with both atoms excited and the field in the vacuum , and two different situations after a time @xmath8 : the field remains in the vacuum and two photons have been emitted . in the former case , </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is generated by the interaction amplitude @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath12 photon exchange make correlations grow during a short time , before vanish eventually due to the non - rwa nature of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath39 although @xmath33 is nonzero its amplitude is negligible compared with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different when two photons are present . </S>",
    "<S> there is a relevant probability that both photons come from the same atom , which in our scheme is represented by the non - rwa amplitude @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> as long as we can not distinguish the source of emission of each photon , concurrence is sizeable for @xmath39 and @xmath12 , and will eventually vanish . </S>",
    "<S> although there are no interaction terms between the atoms , the indistinguishability construes effective interaction terms and @xmath114 plays the role of a frontier between two different spacetime regions .    </S>",
