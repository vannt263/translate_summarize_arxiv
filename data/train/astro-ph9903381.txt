    "over the last few years significant progress has been made in the search for distant galaxy clusters as well as in the study of their galaxy populations .",
    "the existence of massive , virialized systems at very high redshifts has a direct bearing on theories of structure formation ( e.g. , eke et al . 1996 ) .",
    "finding clusters at redshift @xmath11 has become routine in serendipitous searches in the x - ray , based on deep rosat - pspc observations .",
    "near - infrared surveys are now reaching the necessary depth and area to push these searches to redshifts @xmath2 ( e.g. ,  stanford et al .",
    "these studies have provided new constraints on both the evolution of the cluster abundance out to @xmath12 ( see rosati 1998 for a review ) and the evolution of early - type galaxies over a substantial look - back time ( e.g. ,  stanford 1998 ) .",
    "the study of the spectrophotometric properties of cluster galaxies at large redshifts provides a powerful means of discriminating between scenarios for the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "predictions of the color - magnitude distribution of cluster early - types based on hierarchical models of galaxy formation ( kauffmann 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) differ at @xmath13 from models in which ellipticals formed at high-@xmath14 in a monolithic collapse ( eggen et al .  1962 )",
    "this is the result of different star formation histories predicted in the two scenarios . in the former ,",
    "star formation activity is modulated by interactions and merging up to relatively late times , whereas in the single burst scenario the original stellar population evolves passively for a large fraction of the hubble time .",
    "the evolution of the ir - optical colors , the slope of the color - magnitude relation , and the amount of its scatter are important diagnostics for constraining the mode and epoch of formation of the e / s0 galaxies ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; kodama & arimoto 1997 ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "all these studies , which to date have mainly concentrated on clusters at @xmath15 , suggest that early - type galaxies form at @xmath16 , with a high degree of synchronism in their initial epoch of star formation activity .",
    "identifying clusters at @xmath2 provides a valuable sample of galaxies at early cosmic epoch .",
    "the rest frame ultraviolet spectra can be used to age date the stellar populations , providing another measure of the formation epoch of early - type galaxies ( e.g. , dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ; spinrad et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "near - infrared imaging is essential at these large redshifts to compensate the k - correction which significantly dims the dominant population of early - type cluster galaxies at observed optical wavelengths .",
    "stanford et al .",
    "1997 ( hereafter s97 ) have shown that optical - infrared colors can be used to considerably enhance the contrast of the cluster galaxies against the field galaxy population and , at the same time , to estimate the cluster redshift . by using this method",
    "s97 detected a red clump of galaxies with a narrow @xmath1 color distribution in a field galaxy survey covering @xmath17 arcmin@xmath10 ( elston et al .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy with the keck telescope secured 10 galaxy redshifts at @xmath18 with a velocity dispersion of @xmath19 km / s .",
    "an a posteriori analysis of a deep rosat - pspc archival pointing revealed a corresponding low - surface brightness x - ray emission at the cluster position , most likely the result of hot intra - cluster gas with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath20=(0.8\\pm 0.3)\\times   10^{44}{\\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}}$ ] , i.e.  typical of a moderately rich cluster .",
    "this system , clg  j0848 + 4453 , is currently the most distant x - ray emitting cluster found serendipitously in a field survey .",
    "targeted searches for clusters around high - redshift agn have led to several positive identifications ( e.g. , crawford & fabian 1996 ; pascarelle et al . 1996 ; dickinson 1997 ; hall & green 1998 ) .",
    "follow - up deep rosat imaging has also revealed the existence of diffuse x - ray emission around several 3cr sources out to @xmath21 ( dickinson et al .",
    "the rarity of powerful radio galaxies , however , make these studies unsuitable for assessing the cluster abundance , and perhaps unrepresentative of normal cluster environments .",
    "x - ray imaging is also a well established method to search for bona - fide distant clusters ( e.g. , gioia et al .  1990 ,",
    "gioia & luppino , 1994 ) . with the advent of the rosat - pspc , with",
    "its unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution , archival searches for extended x - ray sources have become a very efficient method to construct large , homogeneous samples of galaxy clusters out to at least @xmath12 ( e.g. ,  rosati et al .  1995 , 1998 ; scharf et al .",
    "1997 ; collins et al .  1997 ; vihklinin et al .",
    "the rosat deep cluster survey ( rdcs ) ( rosati et al .  1998 ( r98 ) ) , has shown no evidence of a decline in the space density of galaxy clusters of x - ray luminosity @xmath22 over a wide redshift range , @xmath23 .",
    "the fact that the bulk of the x - ray cluster population is not evolving significantly out to this large redshift increases the chances of finding clusters beyond redshift one , since @xmath24 clusters ( @xmath25 in the [ 0.5 - 2.0 ] kev band , roughly the coma cluster ) can be detected at @xmath2 as extended x - ray sources in deep rosat pointed observations , provided that the x - ray surface brightness profile does not evolve significantly ( see also hasinger et al .",
    "1999 ) .    to improve the success rate of identifying very high redshift clusters from deep x - ray surveys ,",
    "we have begun a program of near - ir imaging of unidentified faint candidates in the rdcs . in this paper",
    ", we describe the imaging and spectroscopic follow - up observations of the first of these x - ray faint candidates , rxj0848.9 + 4452 , which has led to the discovery of a cluster at @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding x - ray source is located in the same pspc field ( the `` lynx field '' ) as the cluster discovered by s97 , and lies only 4.2 arcmin away from clg  j0848 + 4453 at @xmath7 . by combining these new data with the spectrophotometric data of s97",
    ", we find strong evidence for the existence of a superstructure at @xmath27 consisting of two collapsed , possibly virialized clusters .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we adopt the parameters @xmath28 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath6 .",
    "the rdcs was designed to compile a large , x - ray flux - limited sample of galaxy clusters , selected via a serendipitous search for extended x - ray sources in rosat - pspc deep pointed observations ( rosati et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "the depth and the solid angle of the survey were chosen to probe an adequate range of x - ray luminosities over a large redshift baseline .",
    "approximately 160 candidates were selected down to the flux limit of @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 ) , over a total area of 50 deg@xmath10 , using a wavelet - based detection technique .",
    "this technique is particularly efficient in discriminating between point - like and extended , low surface brightness sources ( rosati et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "optical follow - up observations for the cluster candidates consisted primarily of optical imaging in the @xmath31-band , followed by multi - object spectroscopy with 4 m class telescopes at noao and eso . to date , more than 100 new clusters or groups have been spectroscopically confirmed , and about a quarter of these lie at @xmath11 .",
    "the spectroscopic identification is 85% complete to @xmath32 . to this limiting flux the completeness level and the selection function",
    "are well understood . at fainter",
    "fluxes the effective sky coverage pregressively decreases .",
    "in addition , the x - ray identification becomes more difficult due to the increasing confusion and the low signal - to - noise ratio of the x - ray sources which makes it more difficult to discriminate between point - like and extended sources .",
    "below @xmath33 the completeness level can be as low as 50% .",
    "however , it is in these lowest flux bins that the most distant clusters of the survey are expected to lie . if one assumes that the evolutionary trend in the cluster population continues past @xmath34 ,",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity function , @xmath35 , of r98 can be extrapolated to predict that up to a dozen clusters at @xmath36 remain to be identified in the rdcs , which covers about 15 deg@xmath10 at @xmath32 .",
    "this prediction conservatively takes into account the evolution of the bright end ( @xmath37 ) , in keeping with the results of henry et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and the survey incompleteness near the flux limit .",
    "to date , moderately deep @xmath31-band imaging of several candidates with @xmath38 has shown only marginally significant galaxy overdensities in the best cases .",
    "some of these candidates could be x - ray sources of a different nature , rather than galaxy clusters . to increase the efficiency of cluster identification",
    ", we have initiated a program of @xmath39 and @xmath40-band imaging of these faint unidentified candidates in the deepest archival fields of the rdcs .",
    "the lynx field , centered at @xmath41 ( j2000 ) , was observed for 64.3 ksec with the pspc in two pointings ( rp90009a00,a01 ) .",
    "the x - ray data were processed as described in rosati et al .",
    "the object detection and classification yielded 3 cluster candidates in the central area of the detector ( @xmath42 ) ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the brightest one was identified as a cluster at @xmath43 , using the cryocam spectrograph at the kpno 4 m telescope .",
    "a 1200 second @xmath31 band image of the two faint remaining candidates , obtained at the kpno 4 m prime focus , failed to show a strong enhancement in the projected galaxy density at either of the peaks of the x - ray emission .",
    "a 28 arcmin@xmath10 region in the lynx field was also part of a deep multicolor optical - ir survey by elston et al .",
    "the faintest source in table 1 , rxj0848.6 + 4453 , was identified by s97 as the x - ray counterpart of clg  j0848 + 4453 at @xmath7 . in the following",
    ", we will focus on rxj0848.9 + 4452 , the cluster candidate which lies at the extreme southeast corner of the lynx field in the elston et al.near-ir survey .",
    "in figure  [ f : sb ] , we show a comparison between the bidimensional and radial cumulative x - ray surface brightness of rxj0848.9 + 4452 with a nearby point - like source scaled down by a factor 1.8 to account for the flux ratio of the two sources . the latter is located 2 arcmin north ( @xmath44 ) and has been identified as a qso at @xmath45 in spectroscopic observations carried out at the kpno 4 m telescope .",
    "we use this point - like source to register the pspc x - ray image onto the optical images .",
    "this resulted in a 10shift from the nominal position , which is not unusual for aspect solution errors of the pspc .",
    "the statistical @xmath46 residual error in the position of the x - ray centroid is about 5 .",
    "the conversion factor from counts to unabsorbed x - ray flux was calculated using the galactic hi column density in the lynx field , @xmath47 , and assuming a thermal spectrum with @xmath48 kev for the source .",
    "the source counts are integrated over an aperture of @xmath49 mpc radius .",
    "this aperture encircles @xmath50 of the total flux for the profile parameters given below .",
    "the first and second top panels in figure  [ f : sb ] are cut - outs extracted from the pspc image in the [ 0.5 - 2.0 ]  kev band with 8pixels .",
    "the third panel shows a simulated cluster which has been obtained assuming a king profile with core radius of 200 kpc , @xmath51 , and the observed x - ray flux of @xmath52 .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness count distribution is then redshifted to @xmath53 and overlaid onto the measured poissonian background in the lynx field of 0.37 counts / pixel .",
    "this simulation shows that , within the errors due to the low signal - to - noise , typical cluster parameters match the surface brightness distribution of rxj0848.9 + 4452 .",
    "furthermore , the growth curves show that the cluster candidate source is clearly extended when compared with a nearby point - like source , as also revealed by the statistical characterization provided by the wavelet algorithm ( table 1 ) .",
    "given the limited resolution of the pspc and the faintness of the x - ray source , we can not rule out the possibility from the x - ray properties alone that the x - ray emission is the result of source confusion , or is partially contaminated by one or more agn .",
    "the x - ray spectral information on the x - ray source is very poor , although no emission is detected below 0.5 kev , consistent with a thermal cluster spectrum . as we will discuss below",
    ", however , the optical - ir imaging and spectroscopic follow - up observations suggest that the diffuse x - ray emission is most likely due to hot intracluster gas trapped in a gravitationally bound structure .",
    "deep optical imaging of the lynx field in @xmath54 bands was carried out by elston et al .",
    "( 1999 ) at the 4 m telescope of the kitt peak national observatory using the pfccd / t2 kb which covers @xmath55 arcmin with 0.48  pixels .",
    "a deep @xmath31-band image , taken as part of this survey , is shown in figure  [ f : ibandima ] with the x - ray contours overlaid .",
    "although an overdensity of galaxies with @xmath56 is visible around the x - ray peak ( @xmath46 significant above the background counts ) , optical data alone can not distinguish between possible cluster galaxies and the field galaxy population .",
    "since the area around rxj0848.9 + 4452 was only partially covered by the near - ir survey of elston et al . , we obtained @xmath39 and @xmath57 imaging at the palomar 200 `` telescope with the prime - focus infrared camera ( jarrett et al .",

    "these data indicate the presence of a moderately rich galaxy cluster at @xmath4 with rest frame x - ray luminosity @xmath105 ergs s@xmath9 ( 0.52.0 kev band ) .",
    "rxj0848.9 + 4452 is the highest redshift x - ray selected cluster found to date .",
    "an interesting circumstance is that this system lies only 4.2 arcmin away from clg  j0848 + 4453 , an ir - selected cluster previously discovered by stanford et al .",
    "( 1997 ) at @xmath18 , also known to be x - ray luminous with half the @xmath85 of rxj0848.9 + 4452 .",
    "ten spectroscopic members are known to date in clg  j0848 + 4453 and several others have been found in a 28 arcmin@xmath10 field surrounding these two systems .",
    "we therefore find evidence of a high redshift superstructure , consisting of two separate systems , in an advanced stage of collapse as elucidated by the x - ray data .",
    "the two cluster cores are separated by @xmath106 comoving mpc .",
    "furthermore , the redshift distribution of all the spectroscopic members suggests a velocity difference between the two clusters @xmath107 km / s , leading us to speculate that these systems are in the process of merging .",
    "the member galaxies in the two clusters form a homogeneous population with similar colors , the difference in the median value of @xmath1 being less than 0.05 mag .",
    "this supports the conclusion of s97 and sed98 who found that the spectrophotometric properties of these red galaxies are consistent with passively - evolving ellipticals formed at high redshift .",
    "this work shows that the combination of near - ir imaging and the x - ray selection from deep x - ray pointings can lead to the identification of bona - fide clusters at @xmath2 .",
    "the additional advantage of this approach is that the x - ray selection allows the search volume to be estimated and thus the cluster space density to be effectively evaluated , along with the cluster mass function once the cluster mass is measured .",
    "the current limitation of this approach is due to the limited resolution and sensitivity of current x - ray observations which require pushing these studies to flux levels where confusion becomes important and the effective sky coverage becomes very small . with the advent of axaf and xmm , the use of this strategy for cluster searches at @xmath2 promises to be extremely effective , possibly with a success rate of identification as high as the one obtained with the rosat - pspc at @xmath108 .",
    "a census of galaxy clusters at @xmath109 will be a major breakthrough toward our understanding of the formation of both clusters and their constituent galaxy populations .",
