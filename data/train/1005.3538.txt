    "the most massive galaxies in the universe occur in rich groups and clusters .",
    "these brightest cluster galaxies ( hereafter bcgs ) often reside close to the peak of the diffuse x - ray emission from the intracluster medium ( icm ; @xcite ) , and can have recessional velocities indistinguishable from the cluster mean ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) . their major axis is preferentially aligned with that of the host cluster , as defined by the projected distribution of cluster galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the icm x - ray emission @xcite , an effect which seems independent of cluster richness @xcite . furthermore , there is a clear relationship between the stellar luminosity of central bcgs and the total mass and x - ray luminosity of their host cluster @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that many bcgs reside near the centers of the cluster gravitational potential , and that the formation of central bcgs is intimately linked to the formation and evolution of the cluster itself , as anticipated in a hierarchical structure formation scenario .",
    "this idea is supported by results of cosmological simulations which indicate that central bcgs are built up through a series of mergers near the cluster core ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "such simulations also suggest that these mergers must have been predominantly dissipationless , at least for bcg major mergers occurring at low redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the notion that bcgs have a unique formation history is further reinforced by findings indicating that their properties are separate from those of other ( cluster ) galaxies .",
    "for example , the optical luminosity of bcgs is not drawn from the same distribution as that of other cluster members @xcite , bcgs tend to have spatially extended stellar halos not seen around other galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and they are more likely to be radio - loud than other galaxies of similar stellar mass @xcite .    unfortunately , an observational understanding of the formation of bcgs is largely limited by the fact that few systems in the process of forming have actually been identified .",
    "multiple nuclei are common in bcgs at low and moderate redshifts , suggesting that galaxy ",
    "galaxy mergers must be frequent ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in a few cases , multiple galaxies at the initial stages of merging have been identified at the centers of x - ray clusters @xcite , including one case in which tidal features provide direct evidence for galaxy  galaxy interactions @xcite . however , as these examples all occur at moderate to high redshifts , detailed studies of the bcg formation process have not been possible .",
    "potential examples at lower redshift include known dumbbell galaxies @xcite , some of which constitute the brightest galaxy in x - ray clusters",
    ". however , at least some of these are likely to represent various stages in the mergers of _ cluster _ cores , each already containing a fully formed central dominant galaxy @xcite . as such , they may not offer a particularly clean view of the build - up of the bcg itself .    for these reasons",
    ", it also remains uncertain to what extent bcg formation may have affected the thermodynamic history of baryons in x - ray bright cluster cores .",
    "for example , major galaxy ",
    "galaxy mergers near the core of a cluster could provide a mechanism for distributing metals into the icm @xcite and so provide a partial explanation for the pronounced central metal excesses observed in many systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such mergers might also act to disrupt the formation of cool cores , and thereby help explain the puzzling dichotomy between `` cool - core '' and `` non cool - core '' groups and clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    here",
    "we present a _",
    "study of a recently discovered low - redshift ( @xmath0 ) x - ray cluster , mz10451 , with a bcg in the process of forming . to the best of our knowledge , and if excluding dumbbell galaxies but including major merger candidates in low - redshift sdss groups and clusters @xcite , this represents the first known case of an ongoing central bcg major merger in an x - ray cluster in the nearby universe .",
    "the goal of the present investigation is two - fold .",
    "we aim to establish how the ongoing galaxy ",
    "galaxy interaction is affecting the thermodynamics and chemical properties of the icm in the cluster core .",
    "the relatively low icm temperature of this system , @xmath1  kev , makes it attractive for a study of this kind , because any x - ray signatures of the interaction are likely to be more pronounced than in much more massive clusters .",
    "secondly , we also hope to shed light on the bcg formation process itself , e.g.  by exploring whether the merging galaxies contain any hot ( or cold ) gas ( i.e.  whether the merger is dissipationless ) , and whether they show evidence for strong nuclear activity induced by the interaction .",
    "we assume @xmath2  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the target redshift of @xmath6 then corresponds to a luminosity distance of @xmath7  mpc , and @xmath8 on the sky to 67  kpc .",
    "we further adopt solar abundances from @xcite , and a local galactic hi absorbing column of @xmath9  @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , uncertainties are given at the 68% confidence level .",
    "as part of the _ xi _ groups survey @xcite , we have obtained comprehensive multi - wavelength data for a sample of 25 groups and poor clusters .",
    "we are using _ xmm - newton _ to study the x - ray properties of each system , and the imacs multi - object spectrograph @xcite on the 6.5-m baade / magellan telescope at las campanas to determine group membership down to very faint luminosities ( @xmath11 ) .",

    "this is well within the typical uncertainty in our imacs redshift measurements of @xmath45  km  s@xmath3 @xcite , demonstrating that , along the line of sight , both galaxies are consistent with being at rest relative to the group center .",
    "secondly , both galaxies display morphological features consistent with an interaction .",
    "most prominent is an extensive stellar plume that extends @xmath45  kpc northwards from the optical nucleus of galaxy  a. an extended stellar component is also visible around galaxy  b , as is a bright stellar bridge between the two objects .",
    "mz10451 was observed by _",
    "chandra _ in very faint telemetry mode for a total exposure of @xmath46  ks , with the acis - s3 ccd as aimpoint .",
    "observations were split into three separate pointings , which were analyzed using ciao v4.1 .",
    "to apply the newest calibration data and enable the suppression of background events afforded by the telemetry mode , new level  2 event files were generated .",
    "cti corrections , time - dependent gain corrections , and standard grade filtering was applied .",
    "lightcurves extracted for the s3 ccd in the 2.57  kev band revealed no evidence for background flares in any of the pointings , leaving a total effective exposure time of 78.56  ks . while the focus here is on the properties of the central group regions of mz10451 as seen by _",
    "chandra _ , we facilitate the analysis by including our _ xmm _ data where relevant .",
    "these data were prepared following the prescription outlined in @xcite .",
    "the _ xmm _ data indicate detectable icm emission out to at least @xmath47 from the x - ray peak ( section  [ sec , results ] ) , implying that any methods involving local background estimation should be avoided for the analysis of diffuse emission in the _ chandra _ s3 data .",
    "employing the `` blank - sky '' background data in the _ chandra _ calibration database for this purpose is also problematic , because the particle background component is now much more pronounced than at the time of these blank - sky observations ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we have verified this by extracting blanksky - subtracted source spectra in regions that are not source - dominated , revealing prominent excess emission even at @xmath48  kev , presumably from unsubtracted particles .",
    "instead , we employed the 275-ks of ` period  e ' background data taken with the acis array in the stowed position , in which only non - x - ray events are recorded .",
    "these data can thus be used to estimate the particle contribution to the total background . the latest observation to be included in these data",
    "was performed just three months prior to our mz10451 observation and so should not display serious discrepancies with respect to the actual particle level in our data .",
    "indeed , in the 9.512  kev band , the total flux ratio between source and stowed data exceeds unity by an acceptable 79% among our three pointings ( compared to almost 60% for to blanksky data ) .",
    "the stowed data are scaled up by these small factors in our analysis .    in all spectral analysis , we subtracted the particle contribution using the stowed data , and modeled the remaining background components .",
    "the latter include the extragalactic x - ray background , whose spectrum can be well described by a power - law of photon index @xmath49 , and diffuse galactic emission which is strongly spatially varying but can be described by a low - temperature thermal plasma model .",
    "our _ xmm _ data were used to constrain the properties of these two components at the position of mz10451 as follows .",
    "spectra were extracted for each epic camera in bins of @xmath50  net counts within a @xmath5110@xmath52  annulus of the x - ray peak .",
    "energies @xmath53  kev were excluded , to suppress the particle - induced contribution including the instrumental fluorescence lines at @xmath541.6  kev .",
    "the results were jointly fitted with a model consisting of a power - law subject to galactic absorption plus an unabsorbed solar - abundance thermal plasma model .",
    "free parameters were thus the power - law index @xmath55 , plasma temperature @xmath56 , and the normalization of the two components",
    ". the resulting fit , with @xmath57 for 72 degrees of freedom , yielded uncertainties on the best - fit values of @xmath58 and @xmath59  kev of only @xmath60% .",
    "the pn spectrum and best - fit model are presented in figure  [ fig , pnbkg ] .",
    "we include this background model in all fits to the _ chandra _ data .",
    "leaving the relative normalization of the thermal and power - law components free to vary did not impact significantly on our results , so this ratio was fixed to that derived from the _ xmm _ fit , with only the overall background normalization remaining as a free parameter .",
    "source and stowed - background spectra and associated response products were extracted separately for each of the three _ chandra _ pointings , with spectra accumulated in bins of @xmath61  net  counts and jointly fitted in xspec v11.3 .",
    "whenever relevant , a similar approach was adopted for source and blanksky - background spectra extracted for each _ xmm _ camera .",
    "in addition to the x - ray data , we also acquired optical long - slit spectroscopy of each of the merging galaxies , using the imacs camera at the baade / magellan telescope in november 2009 .",
    "the f/2 camera mode was used with the 300  lines  mm@xmath3 grism , giving a nominal wavelength range of 390010000   and a dispersion of 1.34    pixel@xmath3 .",
    "each galaxy was observed for 30  min using a 0.9-arcsec wide slit ( corresponding to a physical scale of @xmath62 1  kpc at the group redshift ) .",
    "general details of the flat - fielding , bias- and sky - subtraction , and wavelength calibration can be found in @xcite .",
    "the large - scale morphology of the icm in mz10451 is most easily discerned from our _ xmm _ data .",
    "based on a particle - subtracted and exposure - corrected 0.32  kev epic mosaic image , figure  [ fig , xmmmosaic](a ) shows adaptively smoothed _ xmm _",
    "contours of the central @xmath63  arcmin ( @xmath64  mpc@xmath65 ) region .",
    "the surface brightness distribution clearly exhibits a fairly symmetric morphology , consistent with the expectation for a virialized system . on the largest scales probed by _ xmm _ , there is an indication of the icm distribution being slightly elongated in the north  south direction , roughly coinciding with the axis joining the two central galaxies .",
    "+    based on the same ( unsmoothed ) data , figure  [ fig , xmmmosaic](b ) shows a radial surface brightness profile of the diffuse emission , extracted from the x - ray peak in bins containing a signal - to - noise ratio of s / n  @xmath66 .",
    "uncertainties in this plot contain a 10% systematic error associated with the subtraction of the _ xmm _ particle background , added in quadrature to all poisson uncertainties .",
    "emission is robustly detected out to at least @xmath67  arcsec ( @xmath68  kpc ) .",
    "a simple @xmath69model with @xmath70 provides a reasonable description of the profile across this radial range , with the exception of the very core which shows a slight excess of emission above the best - fit model . a thermal plasma model ( apec ) fit to the global _ xmm _ spectrum within the full region covered in figure  [ fig , xmmmosaic](b ) provides an acceptable fit , @xmath71 for 111 degrees of freedom , and would suggest @xmath72  kev and @xmath73  z@xmath38 .",
    "we note that this abundance measurement is plausibly biased low due to the likely presence of temperature variations across this large radial range ( `` fe bias '' ; @xcite ) . the best - fit model would imply a 0.32  kev luminosity of @xmath74  erg  s@xmath3 , with the bolometric value a factor of 1.8 higher .",
    "subtracting the particle background as estimated from stowed data and excluding identified point sources , a total of @xmath624,900 net counts ( 0.32  kev ) from diffuse x - ray emission is detected on the _ chandra _",
    "s3  ccd , roughly a factor of four more than in the shallower _ xmm _ pn data of the same region .",
    "figure  [ fig , cxomosaic ] shows a particle - subtracted , exposure - corrected , and adaptively smoothed _",
    "chandra _ mosaic image of the central regions .",
    "afforded by the superior spatial resolution of _ chandra _ , these data clearly demonstrate that both central galaxies are offset from the peak of the diffuse x - ray emission at ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) = ( 02@xmath77 , @xmath78 ) , suggesting that neither galaxy is completely at rest at the center of the group gravitational potential .",
    "the x - ray morphology of the group core is quite regular , presenting little evidence that the ongoing galaxy interaction has yet had any profound impact on the central icm density distribution .",
    "also note that an emission component at the optical position of galaxy  b is clearly visible .    to test for radial variations in icm temperature and abundance and",
    "search for icm signatures of the ongoing merger , _ chandra _ spectra were extracted in concentric annuli centered on the x - ray peak , each containing @xmath621,000  counts from diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "these were fitted with an apec model added to the x - ray background model described in section  [ sec , obs ] .",
    "deprojection was not attempted , as our _ xmm _ data show that the regions beyond the _ chandra _ s3 ccd are not free of group emission .",
    "the resulting radial profiles of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are shown in figure  [ fig , profiles ] .",
    "note that the x - ray peak is located @xmath81 east of the s3 ccd center , enabling coverage towards the western ccd corners to @xmath47 in figure  [ fig , profiles ] , although the angular coverage in the outermost radial bin is considerably less than 360  degrees .",
    "the temperature profile reveals the presence of slightly cooler gas in the group core , showing a peak in the radial bin that extends from @xmath821.3@xmath52 ( @xmath8390  kpc ) from the core",
    ". the central temperature drop may not be quite as pronounced as in typical cool - core groups , with the innermost sub - bin in figure  [ fig , profiles ] nominally being only @xmath84% cooler than the peak temperature ( the drop is significant at the @xmath85 level ) .",
    "however , resolution effects could have an impact on this , given the higher redshift of this system compared to those of typical well - studied x - ray groups ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an orthogonal regression fit in @xmath79log@xmath86 space to the outermost four bins in figure  [ fig , profiles](a ) yields @xmath87 for the slope outside the core , consistent with results for typical cool - core groups @xcite .",
    "we can therefore approximate the temperature profile as a piecewise log  linear function , @xmath88 similarly , the abundance profile can be approximated as constant at 0.3  solar outside the core , rising linearly in log@xmath86log@xmath80 space to its central value .",
    "these parametrizations are illustrated by the dashed lines in figure  [ fig , profiles ] .",
    "while the temperature profile is thus typical of cool - core groups , the abundance profile is slightly unusual .",
    "although showing the central peak of roughly solar abundance typical of such systems , the profile does not exhibit the steady radial decline seen in such groups but is instead consistent with being largely flat outside the core .",
    "note also that the derived _",
    "abundances are everywhere larger than suggested by the fit to the global _ xmm _ spectrum within this region , supporting the suspicion that the _ xmm _ estimate could be affected by the fe bias arising from the presence of significant temperature variations",
    ". we also checked the si / fe ratio for the region encompassing the innermost two bins in figure  [ fig , profiles](b ) , using a vapec model fit .",
    "although @xmath89 is poorly constrained , the ratio is found to be @xmath90  z@xmath91z@xmath92 at @xmath93 significance , indicating an important contribution to central enrichment from type  ia supernovae and hence from an old stellar population .    combining the _ xmm _ surface brightness profile , which is well constrained to large radii , with the parametrized _ chandra _ temperature and abundance profiles ( slightly smoothed to ensure a continuous behavior ) , profiles of deprojected gas density @xmath94 , entropy @xmath95 ,",
    "cooling time , and total mass were determined .",
    "the latter was obtained via the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , as supported by the regular icm morphology on large scales .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig , mass ] .",
    "uncertainties on each profile were obtained from 1,000 monte carlo realizations , for each of which all relevant parameters ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath69 , @xmath98 , and surface brightness normalization ) were drawn from a gaussian distribution centered at the measured or parametrized value and with 1-@xmath99 width equal to the typical 1-@xmath99 uncertainty on the relevant parameter . at each interpolated radius , we recorded the resultant outlier - resistant biweight mean and standard deviation .",
    "the latter represent the 1-@xmath99 error bounds shown in figure  [ fig , mass ] .",
    "errors on overdensity radii were evaluated from the mass profile using an analogous procedure .",
    "the entropy profile is fairly typical of cool - core groups , showing a continuous decline towards the center , and a logarithmic slope at large radii which is flatter than that expected from gravitational processes only @xcite .",
    "the cooling time profile shows a central value of @xmath100  gyr and a slope at large @xmath86 in good agreement with results for hotter systems @xcite .",
    "the derived mass profile implies a total mass of @xmath101  m@xmath38 within the radius of x - ray detection ( @xmath102  kpc ) , which is itself bracketed by the resulting values of @xmath103  kpc and @xmath104  kpc .",
    "the estimated virial radius in the adopted cosmology is @xmath105  kpc , enclosing an extrapolated mass of @xmath106  m@xmath38 .",
    "table  [ tab , x_opt ] includes relevant quantities obtained from the mass profile .",
    "although mz10451 is intrinsically fairly x - ray luminous , its considerable distance ( @xmath107  mpc ) still renders it too faint to allow spectral mapping at fine spatial detail with the present _ chandra _ data .",
    "hence , to further investigate the icm properties in the group core and to identify regions of particular interest for spectral analysis , we first generated a hardness ratio map of the group core .",
    "for this , energy bands of 0.51 and 12  kev were chosen , in order to provide comparable number of counts in the ` soft ' and ` hard ' bands .",
    "we avoid the lowest energies , to reduce contamination from any patchy , soft galactic emission .",
    "mosaic images in each band were particle - subtracted and corrected for exposure variations , and results were smoothed using scales resulting from adaptively smoothing the corresponding full - band 0.52  kev image .",
    "the hard - band image was then divided by the soft - band one . for the temperatures and abundances seen in figure  [ fig , profiles ] , the hardness ratio map @xmath108 in these energy bands",
    "provides a useful proxy for spatial variations in icm temperature @xmath109 along the line of sight @xcite . utilizing this , 2-d maps of projected pseudo - entropy @xmath110 and pressure @xmath111",
    "were also constructed , based on @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the icm emission measure . to generate these maps , a 0.52  kev image , smoothed on the same scales as @xmath108 ,",
    "was taken as a proxy for @xmath115 ( modulo metallicity variations ) , since at fixed metallicity @xmath116  z@xmath38 ( as seen outside the very core ) , the emissivity of a plasma varies by @xmath117% for the range of temperatures in figure  [ fig , profiles ] @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , caution should be exercised when interpreting these maps , due to the degeneracy with metallicity and the presence of statistical fluctuations .",
    "the results are displayed in figure  [ fig , maps ] , which shows the central @xmath118 region around the x - ray peak , corresponding to the region covered by the two innermost bins in figure  [ fig , profiles](b ) .",
    "the hardness ratio map in figure  [ fig , maps](a ) generally suggests fairly uniform hardness ratios on these spatial scales , but with some notable exceptions : the central regions display relatively soft emission , while a region of slightly harder emission is seen south of the group core .",
    "if interpreting these features as due to variations in icm temperature , the results support the presence of slightly cooler gas in the group core on scales of 2030  kpc , as already hinted at by figure  [ fig , profiles ] .",
    "several of the detected point sources in this region also show emission which is considerably harder than that of the icm , but , interestingly , this is less obviously so for the two central galaxies .",
    "the map also suggests the presence of a curved region of slightly hotter material immediately south of galaxy  b , referred to in figure  [ fig , maps](a ) and in the following as the southern `` hotspot '' .    the entropy map in figure  [ fig , maps](b ) suggests the presence of a central region of relatively low - entropy gas , centered close to the x - ray peak .",
    "the entropy distribution generally appears fairly symmetric and reveals no prominent features around the two central galaxies .",
    "in particular , there is no clear indication of ongoing ism stripping from either galaxy , e.g. , in the form of irregularly distributed low - entropy material in their immediate vicinity .",
    "note that the southern hotspot visible in the hardness ratio map also shows up in this diagram as a region of slightly enhanced icm entropy .",
    "the pressure map , figure  [ fig , maps](c ) , indicates that icm thermal pressure is generally declining outwards from the x - ray peak , as expected for hot gas in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "however , the map also presents several potentially interesting features .",
    "one of these is a region of seemingly enhanced icm pressure _ between _ the two galaxies , as marked in the figure .",
    "no corresponding surface brightness enhancement is clearly seen ( which could suggest a local enhancement in @xmath80 at fixed projected density ) , nor in entropy or hardness ratio .",
    "we also note that the x - ray peak seems to be surrounded by two small low - pressure regions , with no obvious counterparts in the surface brightness distribution ( cf.figure  [ fig , cxomosaic ] ) , but the available statistics do not allow a detailed investigation of their robustness or possible origin .",
    "we can , however , test the robustness of the hotspot seen south of galaxy  b. for this , a spectrum was extracted in a rectangular region covering this feature and fitted with a thermal plasma model . figure  [ fig , specregions ] outlines the spectral extraction regions discussed in the following . within the region",
    "labelled `` h '' in the figure , the derived temperature , @xmath119  kev , is indeed higher than that obtained for a comparable control region at similar distance north of the x - ray peak ( region `` c '' in figure  [ fig , specregions ] ) , @xmath120  kev .",
    "formally , these results differ at 1.5-@xmath99 significance , with the southern region being @xmath84% hotter .",
    "we note that although the position of the temperature peak in figure  [ fig , profiles ] is consistent with that of this region , results for the radial profile do not change significantly if excluding this region from the second radial bin in the profile ; the presence of a peak in the temperature profile at this radius is therefore not simply due to the hotspot .",
    "we also note that the derived metallicity within this region , @xmath121  z@xmath38 , is fully consistent with the radial average at this distance from the x - ray peak , @xmath122  z@xmath38 .",
    "this implies that the presence of this feature is not simply due to strong local variations in icm abundance .",
    "another interesting question is how the icm metallicity in the region covered by the stellar plume of galaxy  a compares to that of its immediate surroundings .",
    "this plume might represent tidally stripped material that could evolve into an intracluster light component .",
    "these stars would be able to chemically pollute the surrounding icm very efficiently , as their ejecta would mix directly with the icm without having to overcome the confining gravitational potential and gas pressure of their former host galaxy . to test this possibility ,",
    "a spectrum was extracted in a wedge extending @xmath123 northwards from the x - ray peak ( region `` p '' in figure  [ fig , specregions ] ) , with the minimum size of the region dictated by the need to get at least 500 counts as required for a rough measurement .",
    "corresponding wedges extending to the east and west of the peak were employed as control regions .",
    "all regions had their apex centered on the x - ray peak rather than on galaxy  a itself , such that the metal - rich group core ( cf.figure  [ fig , profiles ] ) would be equally represented in all wedges and thus not bias the result for the northern wedge . for the n wedge , we find @xmath124  z@xmath38 , compared to @xmath125  z@xmath38 for the combined e and w wedges .",
    "hence , gas coinciding with the stellar plume does show significantly higher abundance than other regions at similar distance from the group core .",

    "these features suggest a system with icm properties very typical of those of relaxed x - ray bright groups and clusters .    before addressing the impact of the central galaxy merger on the icm , as well as the nature of the merger itself , it is useful to first assess the current stage of the interaction .",
    "it is not immediately clear from the present data whether the two galaxies have already experienced a first close passage .",
    "the pronounced tidal stream protruding northwards from galaxy  a might suggest so , but dedicated @xmath205-body simulations of binary mergers ( which we hope to employ in future work ) would be needed to firmly establish under which orbital conditions this feature could arise .",

    "the possible destruction of cool cores , or the prevention of them forming in the first place , is still poorly understood and widely debated in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our results suggest that central galaxy ",

    "@xcite ) . in partial support of the former possibility",
    ", we note that dynamical heating by galaxy motions alone generally seem insufficient to significantly disrupt cooling in cluster cores @xcite .",
    "the situation in mz10451 is somewhat different from that in typical x - ray clusters where a fully formed bcg is already residing at the cluster center and potentially re - heating its surroundings via intermittent agn activity . nevertheless , the offset between galaxy  a and the x - ray peak is still small , @xmath220  kpc , and the central cooling time of @xmath213  gyr is comparable to that of other cool - core systems at the relevant radii @xcite .",

    ", some features of the icm thermodynamic properties may be linked to the ongoing interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig , maps](c ) indicates the presence of a region of enhanced icm pressure between the two galaxies , with no obvious counterpart in the surface brightness or entropy maps . in the absence of external influences , this feature should disappear roughly on its sound crossing timescale , which is @xmath211  myr for its estimated spatial extent of @xmath223  kpc .",
    "it is therefore likely to be associated with a very recent or ongoing event , plausibly reflecting ongoing adiabatic compression and heating of the icm between the galaxies , induced by their relative motion .",
    "it remains unclear , however , whether the tentative presence of an extended region of hot , high - entropy gas immediately south of galaxy  b is related to the interaction .",
    "the hardness ratio and entropy maps suggest that the extent of the structure is several tens of kpc even at its narrowest range .",
    "thus , an explanation invoking a shock front generated by galaxy  b moving supersonically southwards seems excluded . alternatively",
    ", this gas could represent high - entropy material ejected or stripped from either galaxy as a result of the interaction , but again , the sheer size of this feature makes this unlikely .",
    "there are insufficient counts in this region to test for departures from solar abundance ratios , thus precluding any direct tests for a possible origin in starburst outflows .",
    "however , such an explanation would be at odds with the lack of clear post - starburst features in the optical spectrum of either galaxy .",
    "it is possible that the feature is due to `` sloshing '' of the core gas owing to the gravitational perturbation to the group potential caused by the ongoing merger , although the absence of a similar feature in the surface brightness distribution may argue against this @xcite .",
    "another possibility , discussed in more detail in the next section , is that it is related to a larger - scale interaction between two sub - groups",
    ".    from the viewpoint of the icm abundance distribution , figure  [ fig , profiles ] shows that any merger  induced icm enrichment is so far confined to the innermost @xmath224  kpc and",
    "so has had no large - scale impact on the icm metal content .",
    "nevertheless , the central abundance peak seen in this and many other systems could be partly related to processes associated with bcg formation .",
    "the observation of enhanced icm abundances in the region covered by the stellar plume of galaxy  a may signify the presence of stripped , highly enriched ism from this galaxy .",
    "this would suggest that central metal excesses could generally have a contribution from enriched gas shed by central bcg progenitors .",
    "in fact , the icm mixing expected during such a merger may help to explain the considerable _ extent _ of the central abundance peak in many systems , thus alleviating the need for additional subsequent processes , such as agn  driven turbulence @xcite , to disperse metals well beyond the optical extent of the central bcg .",
    "an alternative explanation would associate the central abundance peak in mz10451 with _ in situ _",
    "enrichment by stars tidally stripped during the interaction , some of which are likely to evolve into an intracluster light component . to assess the feasibility of this scenario",
    ", we first reiterate that the subsolar si / fe ratio seen in the central region implies an important contribution from sn  ia and hence from old stars , in line with results for fully formed bcgs in x - ray bright groups @xcite .",
    "this also indicates that central icm enrichment from any young stellar population in the plume ( or within the possibly star - forming galaxy  b ) must be modest , in line with the apparent absence of the plume in our uv and @xmath12 m images in figure  [ fig , galpair ] . at the resolution of figure  [ fig , profiles ] , the elevated icm abundance in the group core implies an _ excess _ fe mass in the core of @xmath225  m@xmath38 .",
    "aperture photometry based on our magellan @xmath129-band image further suggests that @xmath226 of the stellar light of galaxy  a is located in this plume , indicating a plume stellar mass of @xmath227  m@xmath38 for @xmath228  m@xmath140l@xmath38 as assumed in section  [ sec , pair ] .",
    "given these values , sn  ia in the plume could have provided the central fe excess on a timescale of just @xmath215  gyr , estimated using the approach of @xcite and excluding any contribution from sn  ii or stellar winds .",
    "thus , it seems entirely feasible for intracluster light generated by the merger to have produced the central fe excess . forthcoming _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) imaging of mz10451 will be used to provide more reliable mass and age estimates of the stripped stellar component of galaxy  a and further test the viability of this picture .",
    "the relatively undisturbed appearance of the icm suggests that the central bcg merger does not result as a consequence of a recent larger - scale merger between separate subgroups .",
    "idealized hydrodynamical simulations of major cluster ",
    "cluster mergers with a range of progenitor mass ratios and impact parameters suggest that the timescale for a merged system to appear relaxed , as judged visually from the morphology of its x - ray isophotes , is @xmath217  gyr from the time at which the gas core of the secondary merges with that of the primary @xcite .",
    "for mz10451 specifically , we note that the icm appears regular on the scales of figure  [ fig , xmmmosaic ] , i.e.out to at least @xmath229  kpc .",
    "the icm should relax roughly on a sound crossing time @xmath230 .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq , tprof ] ) to evaluate the local sound speed at all @xmath86 gives @xmath231  gyr within @xmath232  kpc , and @xmath233  gyr within @xmath234  kpc , in broad agreement with the general expectation from the above simulations .",
    "this confirms that any major group  group merger in mz10451 can not have taken place very recently",
    ".    however , it may still be premature to entirely dismiss the possibility of such a merger , partly because the observed entropy enhancement to the south of the group core is not easily explained by a galaxy  galaxy interaction alone , and partly because the icm may have relaxed more rapidly than the galaxies .",
    "we note that the entropy feature is not seen in the surface brightness distribution of figure  [ fig , cxomosaic ] , is not particularly sharply defined in the entropy and temperature maps of figure  [ fig , maps ] , and has higher temperature and entropy than its surroundings .",
    "it is therefore unlikely to represent a cold front @xcite resulting from a subgroup penetrating the group core , or a remnant cool core of such a subgroup .    nevertheless , it is still conceivable that the feature represents a weak , merger - generated shock front , possibly viewed at some oblique angle .",
    "if so , a lower limit to its age of @xmath235  myr can be estimated from its current projected distance to the x - ray core of @xmath236  kpc , assuming propagation from the core at a velocity comparable to the local sound speed .",
    "one might have expected a similar feature to the north of the group core , but projection effects could be rendering this undetectable .",
    "in addition , simulations of cluster ",
    "cluster mergers @xcite suggest that such central entropy asymmetries , including the curved appearance of the region in figure  [ fig , maps ] , _ can _ arise as a consequence of shock heating in cluster mergers when the progenitor mass ratio differs substantially from unity ( @xmath2373:1 ) .",
    "we note that dissipation of turbulent energy injected by such a shock could easily account for the observed entropy enhancement .",
    "the mean icm density at the approximate radial distance of this feature is @xmath238  @xmath239 ; for a cylindrical volume of length @xmath240 and base diameter @xmath241 ( assuming a depth along the line of sight equal to the `` width '' of the feature ) , the total gas mass is then @xmath189  m@xmath38 within this region .",
    "the energy required to raise @xmath79 of this gas by @xmath242  kev , as suggested by our spectral analysis , is @xmath243  erg .",
    "this is three orders of magnitude below what can be provided by shocks generated by a major group  group merger producing a system of the relevant virial mass @xcite , so energetically it seems entirely feasible to produce this feature through shocks associated with an infalling subgroup .",
    "hence , the observed north  south entropy asymmetry could conceivably result from the aftermath of a group  group merger , with galaxy  a and b representing the central galaxies of the two progenitor groups .",

    "as also illustrated in figure  [ fig , galdistr](a ) , the spatial distribution of galaxies in the group provides no clear indication that infall of a subgroup , let alone a group  group major merger , has recently taken place . to test this possibility in more detail and search for evidence of kinematic substructure in the system",

    "both our galaxies have @xmath204 comparable to this limit ( section  [ sec , pair ] ) .",
    "the presence of extended thermal emission associated with galaxy  b indicates that it , too , possesses a hot halo , suggesting that such halos may be preserved at least at this merger stage . in the case of galaxy",
    "a , no such halo is unambiguously detected , so it remains a possibility that any extended halo of this galaxy has been largely disrupted , since this galaxy also appears particularly disturbed in the optical .",
    "we should note , however , that we do not have the s / n or spatial resolution to directly establish whether either galaxy shows current evidence for hot gas stripping , although the pseudo - entropy map ( figure  [ fig , maps ] ) suggests that any such activity must be modest .",
    "it is commonly assumed , as also suggested by numerical simulations , that the nature of low - redshift major mergers leading to bright , early - type bcgs is largely dissipationless , involving progenitors containing little or no gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on observed stellar rotational velocities in nearby bcgs , some likely counterexamples do exist however , although these seem rather rare @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to establish to what extent either of the merging galaxies in mz10451 is experiencing active star formation fueled by a reservoir of _ cold _ gas .    in the case of galaxy",
    "a , the observed nuv flux would suggest weak star formation at a level of @xmath264  m@xmath38  yr@xmath3 , but no ir emission is accompanying the uv output down to our approximate detection limit of 0.1  m@xmath38  yr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in addition , its fuv  nuv color of @xmath265 is consistent with that seen for the majority of passively evolving ellipticals @xcite , suggesting that the uv light may be dominated by that of an evolved stellar population .",
    "while this latter point remains true also for galaxy  b , this case is nevertheless more ambiguous .",
    "the galaxy is detected at 24@xmath266 m , but there is no clear evidence for optical emission lines or nuclear x - ray activity .",
    "any agn responsible for the 24@xmath266 m emission must thus be subject to strong intrinsic obscuration , with an absorbing column exceeding @xmath267  @xmath10 for typical agn x - ray luminosities .",
    "examples of such highly obscured agn do occur at low redshift ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , including , as is the case for galaxy  b , galaxies that do not show any seyfert signatures in the optical band .",
    "alternatively , the infrared emission may instead be powered by dusty star formation , implying that the galaxy also retains some cold gas .",
    "if so , the observed 24@xmath266 m flux would suggest low - level star formation at a rate of @xmath264  m@xmath38  yr@xmath3 , computed using the prescription in @xcite which takes into account the contribution from cold dust heated by an evolved stellar population .",
    "if attributed to young stars , the _ galex _ nuv flux would instead suggest a rate of @xmath268  m@xmath38  yr@xmath3 based on the @xcite relation and before correction for dust attenuation .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that some obscured star formation activity is taking place , supporting the notion of a cold gas reservoir in galaxy  b. unfortunately , the absence of a robust _ spitzer _ detection of either galaxy at 70@xmath266 m implies that we can not use the 24/70@xmath266 m flux ratio to distinguish between star formation and agn activity .",
    "furthermore , the available nvss radio data of the galaxy pair are not deep enough to provide useful constraints in this regard .",
    "the radio luminosity limits are well below a commonly adopted dividing line between starburst galaxies and radio - loud agn of @xmath269  w  hz@xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but while the limit on the @xmath270 parameter for galaxy  b , @xmath271 , is consistent with that of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it does not rule out a contribution from agn activity to the 24@xmath266 m emission .",
    "deep hi or co observations would thus be needed to decisively test for the presence of a cold gas reservoir in galaxy  b. while such data will eventually be provided by the upcoming wallaby survey to be undertaken by the australian ska pathfinder array , we simply note here that the tentative evidence for obscured star formation within galaxy  b points to an early - type major merger which does involve some gas , with the implication that at least some low - redshift bcg major mergers must be dissipational to some degree .",
    "coupled with the absence of pronounced nuclear activity in either galaxy , this result is consistent with a picture in which the early stages of interactions between early - type galaxies first trigger residual star formation , followed by efficient central inflow of gas leading to strong agn activity at the final stages ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    if identifying the peak of diffuse x - ray emission with the center of the group gravitational potential , our results also suggest that bcgs may form very close to the latter .",
    "this is consistent with a picture in which central bcgs have been built up through a series of mergers near cluster cores , in line with the galactic cannibalism scenario for bcg growth discussed by @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , it is possible that galaxy  a was initially at rest at the position of the x - ray peak but has now been slightly displaced as a result of the ongoing interaction .",
    "furthermore , our radial velocity measurements and the fact that the merging pair and the x - ray peak are all aligned , indicate that the motion of the galaxies occurs largely in radial orbits along a north - south axis , coinciding with the direction defined by the stellar plume of galaxy  a. at the same time , the large - scale x - ray morphology seen in figure  [ fig , xmmmosaic ] implies an overall icm elongation along a similar axis . if the elongation of the icm betrays the orientation of the filaments feeding the cluster , then the merging galaxies and their `` parent '' filaments line up .",
    "this is consistent with expectations from simulations , which suggest that the mergers forming central bcgs occur preferentially along radial orbits aligned with the filaments feeding the host cluster , and thus with the major axis of the cluster itself ( @xcite and references therein ) .      as a final point , it is interesting to also consider the likely properties of the merger product , in terms of the nature of the merged central galaxy and of the group as a whole . as mentioned , the estimated @xmath138-band luminosity of the merged galaxy would be @xmath272  l@xmath38 . using @xmath39 from table  [ tab , x_opt ] , we can compare this to the expectation based on the observed low - redshift correlations between bcg @xmath138-band luminosity and @xmath39 of the host cluster derived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "either of these relations would suggest @xmath273  l@xmath38 for a bcg in a group of this mass , in excellent agreement with the above estimate . while some of the stellar mass of the bcg progenitors will be tidally stripped in the merging process and",
    "thus will not contribute directly to @xmath274 @xcite , it seems likely that mz10451 in the post - merger phase would thus have properties in good agreement with the observed @xmath275@xmath39 relations , particularly in light of the very considerable scatter around these relations at low values of @xmath39 .",
    "the tidally stripped stars seen around both merging galaxies may become unbound during the interaction and would then contribute to the emergence of an intracluster light component .",
    "this possibility will be investigated in more detail in a future paper based on our forthcoming _",
    "hst _ imaging of this system .",
    "however , we note for now that our existing imaging of mz10451 seems consistent with the notion that an intracluster light component can form in systems which do not already have a central dominant early - type galaxy .",
    "such a scenario draws support from cosmological simulations which suggest that major mergers associated with bcg formation play a prominent , and possibly dominant , role in the generation of intracluster light @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that mz10451 would not become a `` fossil group '' as a consequence of the merger , if adopting the definition of @xcite .",
    "although the x - ray luminosity criterion , @xmath276  erg  s@xmath3 , is already safely met , the combined magnitude of the merger product of @xmath277 would be only @xmath278  mag brighter than that of the subsequently second - brightest galaxy within @xmath279  kpc , thus falling short of the @xmath280 gap between the first- and second - ranked galaxy required to meet the above definition of a fossil system .",
    "this remains true even if just considering the region within @xmath281  kpc , for which @xmath282 would be @xmath283  mag .    taking this argument even further",
    ", we note that any subsequent merger between the forming central galaxy and the resulting brightest satellite galaxy within a projected distance of @xmath284 ( with @xmath285  m@xmath38 ) _ would _ create an @xmath129-band magnitude gap of @xmath286 ( @xmath287 ) .",
    "this satellite currently has a radial velocity @xmath288  km  s@xmath3 relative to the group mean and so is likely to be in a low - eccentricity orbit . under these circumstances , dynamical friction acting on this galaxy",
    "could accomplish such a merger on a time - scale of @xmath289 where @xmath290 and @xmath291 is the current orbital radius and circular velocity of the satellite , respectively , and @xmath292 the characteristic circular velocity of its dark matter halo @xcite . a lower limit to @xmath290",
    "is the projected distance of the satellite from the x - ray peak of @xmath293  kpc .",
    "taking @xmath294 and assuming an @xmath129-band total mass - to - light ratio of 10 for the satellite ( a spiral ) , along with the assumption of an isothermal sphere mass distribution for its halo , we have @xmath295  km  s@xmath3 . with these numbers , equation  ( [ eq , dynfric ] )",
    "would predict a time - scale @xmath296  gyr , with equality corresponding to @xmath297 .",
    "thus , even following the ongoing central merger , mz10451 would be resilient to the formation of a fossil - like configuration by means of dynamical friction for many hubble times .",
    "this is consistent with the notion that present - day fossil systems are unlikely to have formed recently ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath298 low - mass cluster mz10451 is , to our knowledge , a unique system .",
    "it is x - ray bright , harbors a central bcg currently being formed from the major merger of two optically luminous early - type galaxies , and resides at a distance where the nature of the bcg merger and its impact on the surrounding icm can be studied in unprecedented detail .",
    "we have combined _ chandra _ observations of the icm in the cluster core with _ xmm _",
    "data of the large - scale icm properties , and with optical , infrared , and uv data of the merging galaxies , to explore the impact of the interaction on the icm and on the interacting galaxies themselves .",
    "the data indicate detectable icm emission out to at least @xmath299 , centered close to the two interacting galaxies .",
    "the icm surface brightness in mz10451 is symmetrically distributed on both small and large scales , consistent with the expectation for a virialized system .",
    "hence , the ongoing central galaxy ",
    "galaxy interaction has not significantly disturbed the icm density distribution even in the group core . on the largest scales ,",
    "the icm distribution is elongated in the north - south direction , however .",
    "the icm exhibits a cool core and a central metal excess ( here extending to @xmath300  kpc ) , as typically seen in undisturbed x - ray bright systems with a central bcg .",
    "this implies either that cool cores and central abundance peaks are not necessarily destroyed by central galaxy ",
    "galaxy mergers in clusters , or that any significant central icm heating and mixing takes place at post - coalescence stages .",
    "the brighter of the merging galaxies presents a pronounced plume of tidally stripped stars .",
    "the icm metallicity in the region covered by this feature is significantly enhanced .",
    "this suggests efficient local enrichment by intracluster stars ejected by the interaction , or merger - induced stripping of highly enriched gas from either galaxy .",
    "such processes may thus have contributed to building up the pronounced central abundance peak seen in this and other systems .",
    "some of the tidally stripped stars may represent the emergence of an intracluster light component , suggesting that such a component can form in systems that do not already host a central dominant galaxy .",
    "both the merging galaxies are spatially offset from the icm x - ray peak , but only by @xmath220 and @xmath221  kpc , and their radial velocities are both consistent with the group mean within the errors .",
    "this demonstrates that central bcg formation can occur close to the center of the cluster potential , consistent with the notion that central bcgs are built up through a series of mergers in cluster cores .",
    "the merger axis extends toward the x - ray peak and roughly coincides with the axis defined by the large - scale elongation of the icm .",
    "combined with the above , this provides support for a picture in which bcg mergers are caused by galaxies falling along radial orbits aligned with the accreting filaments that feed cluster growth .",
    "a rough estimate based on their current separation suggest that the interacting galaxies are still @xmath301  gyr from nuclear coalescence .",
    "despite being involved in a galaxy  galaxy interaction in the core of an x - ray bright system , at least one of the merging galaxies shows clear evidence of having retained an extended hot gas halo at this stage .",
    "the inferred infrared , uv , and x - ray properties of the galaxy pair are consistent with the presence of low - level obscured star formation in at least one of them",
    ". this would be consistent with a picture in which early - type galaxy interactions initially trigger residual star formation , followed by an agn - dominated phase closer to coalescence .",
    "the tentative evidence for ongoing star formation in one of the merging galaxies suggests that low - redshift bcg major mergers need not be completely dissipationless .",
    "however , while the x - ray data reveal no evidence for strong moderately obscured agn activity in either galaxy , the possibility of an agn hidden behind a compton - thick screen can not be ruled out as an alternative to the presence of cold gas .",
    "deeper radio observations would be required to decisively settle this issue .    our forthcoming _",
    "_ observations of mz10451 should further elucidate the optical properties of the central merging galaxies , and thus help constrain the properties of the merger product itself .",
    "these data will also help in establishing the age of tidally stripped stars , and the generation and properties of any intracluster light in this unusual system .",
    "a detailed analysis of these and our magellan optical data will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",

    "<S> we present multi - wavelength observations of the nearby poor x - ray cluster mz10451 , in which both processes can be studied in unprecedented detail . </S>",
    "<S> _ chandra _ observations of the intracluster medium ( icm ) in the cluster core , which harbors two optically bright early - type galaxies in the process of merging , show that the system has retained a cool core and a central metal excess . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that any merger  induced icm heating and mixing remain modest at this stage . </S>",
    "<S> tidally stripped stars seen around either galaxy likely represent an emerging intracluster light component , and the central icm abundance enhancement may have a prominent contribution from _ in situ _ enrichment provided by these stars . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller of the merging galaxies shows evidence for having retained a hot gas halo , along with tentative evidence for some obscured star formation , suggesting that not all bcg major mergers at low redshift are completely dissipationless . </S>",
    "<S> both galaxies are slightly offset from the peak of the icm emission , with all three lying on an axis that roughly coincides with the large - scale elongation of the icm . </S>",
    "<S> our data are consistent with a picture in which central bcgs are built up by mergers close to the cluster core , by galaxies infalling on radial orbits aligned with the cosmological filaments feeding the cluster . </S>"
