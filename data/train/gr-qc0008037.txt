    "spatially homogeneous ( sh ) cosmologies , that is , cosmological solutions of the einstein field equations that admit a local group of isometries acting on spacelike hypersurfaces , are of considerable importance in theoretical cosmology and have been much studied since the 1960s .",
    "these models can be used to analyze aspects of the physical universe which pertain to or which may be affected by anisotropy in the rate of expansion , for example , the cosmic microwave background radiation , nucleosynthesis in the early universe , and the question of the isotropization of the universe itself ( see , for example , [ 1 ] ) .",
    "spatially homogeneous cosmologies also play an important role in attempts to understand the structure and properties of the space of all cosmological solutions of the einstein field equations , since they are part of a symmetry - based hierarchy of cosmological models of increasing complexity , starting with the familiar friedmann - lemitre models :    * friedmann - lemitre cosmologies * non - tilted sh cosmologies * tilted sh cosmologies * @xmath4 cosmologies * @xmath5 cosmologies * generic cosmologies    the terminology used in this hierarchy has the following meaning .",
    "a sh cosmology is said to be _ tilted _ if the fluid velocity vector is not orthogonal to the group orbits , otherwise the model is said to be _ non - tilted _ [ 2 ] .",
    "a @xmath4 cosmology admits a local two - parameter abelian group of isometries with spacelike orbits , permitting one degree of freedom as regards spatial inhomogeneity , while a @xmath5 cosmology admits one spacelike killing vector field .    an important mathematical link between the various classes in the hierarchy is provided by the idea of representing the evolution using a _",
    "state space_. the physical state of a cosmological model at an instant of time is represented by a point in the state space , which is finite dimensional for classes i)-iii ) and infinite dimensional otherwise .",
    "the einstein field equations are formulated as first order evolution equations , and _ the evolution of a cosmological model is represented by an orbit _",
    "( i.e. , a solution curve ) _ of the evolution equations in the state space_. the state space of a particular class in the hierarchy is contained in the state spaces of the more general classes , which implies that the particular models are represented as special cases of the more general models .",
    "this structure opens the possibility that the evolution of a model in one class may be approximated , over some time interval , by a model in a more special class .",
    "the models in each level of the hierarchy can be classified according to generality in various ways .",
    "for our purposes the most important of these is the algebraic classification of the isometry group of the sh models , the so - called _ bianchi classification _ acting simply transitively on the hypersurfaces of homogeneity , and includes all sh models except for the kantowski - sachs models , which admit an isometry group @xmath6 acting on the hypersurfaces of homogeneity , but with no simply transitive subgroup @xmath7 . ]",
    "( see , for example , [ 3 ] , page 112 ) .",
    "there is also a classification of the @xmath4 cosmologies , determined by the action of the isometry group , that is relevant for this paper .",
    "we refer to [ 4 ] ( table 12.4 on page 268 ) for details of how this classification relates to the bianchi classification .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the matter content of the universe is a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is constant , the cases @xmath9 ( dust ) and @xmath10 ( radiation ) being of primary interest .",
    "considerable work has been done in analyzing sh models , subject to this assumption , and a detailed , although still incomplete , description of the non - tilted models has been obtained .",
    "we refer to [ 4 ] ( chapters 6 & 7)and [ 5 ] , for details .",
    "much less is known about the tilted models , but it is evident that as one moves through stages i)-iii ) in the hierarchy there is an increase in dynamical complexity and new features emerge at each stage .",
    "it is plausible to assume that as one moves to levels iv)-vi ) , which contain inhomogeneous models , this trend will continue .",
    "clearly , understanding the dynamics at one level of complexity is a prerequisite for understanding the dynamics at a higher level .",
    "it is within this framework , which has a long term goal of obtaining qualitative information about the evolution of spatially inhomogeneous models , that the analysis of sh models assumes renewed importance .    for the class of tilted sh models ,",
    "the einstein field equations have been written as an autonomous de in a number of different ways ( see for example , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] and [ 8 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , due to the complexity of the equations , a detailed analysis of the dynamics has not been given except in the case of a subclass of models of bianchi type v [ 9]-[11 ] .",
    "our goal in this paper is to give a qualitative analysis of the dynamics of the tilted sh cosmologies of bianchi type ii near the initial singularity and at late times , using the methods of the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "the bianchi ii cosmologies , while very special within the whole bianchi class , nevertheless play a central role since the bianchi ii state space is part of the boundary of the state space for all higher bianchi types ( i.e. all types except for i and v ) .",
    "we thus expect that an analysis of the dynamics of the tilted bianchi ii class will give insight into the dynamics of the more general tilted bianchi classes , while providing a lower bound for their dynamical complexity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the evolution and constraint equations that arise from the einstein field equations , and in section 3 we describe the stability properties of the equilibrium points of the evolution equations , which provide the basis for the discussion of the dynamics in the singular asymptotic regime in section 4 and in the late time asymptotic regime in section 5 . in section 6 we discuss the implications of the results . appendix a gives details of the derivation of the evolution equations .",
    "parts of the paper , in particular sections 2 and 3 , and the appendices , are inevitably of a rather mathematical nature .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are less technical , and in these sections we give the physical interpretations of the results . in the introduction and in the discussion",
    "we discuss the longer term goals of the research and its potential significance in a broader context .",
    "the background material needed for this paper can be found in [ 4 ] . in appendix a it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the orthonormal frame formalism of ellis & maccallum [ 12 ] ( see [ 4 ] , chapter 1 ) .",
    "in addition , familiarity with some basic concepts and results from the theory of dynamical systems is assumed in sections 2 and 3 ( see [ 4 ] , chapter 4 ) .",
    "we use geometrized units with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and the sign conventions of [ 4 ] .",
    "in order to write the einstein field equations in a form amenable to dynamical systems analysis , we use the orthonormal frame formalism of ellis & maccallum [ 12 ] . in this formalism",
    "the commutation functions of the orthonormal frame are used as the gravitational field variables , which has the advantage of leading directly to first order evolution equations for the gravitational field .",
    "the first step is to choose the orthonormal frame to be invariant under the group of isometries , which implies that the commutation functions depend only on a preferred time variable @xmath13 .",
    "the second step is to choose the timelike frame vector @xmath14 to be equal to the unit normal @xmath15 of the group orbits , which is thus tangent to an irrotational congruence of geodesics .",
    "the third and key step is to make the commutation functions dimensionless by dividing them by the rate of expansion of the normal congruence , which leads to variables that remain bounded throughout the evolution of the models .",
    "as described in appendix a , the class of tilted bianchi ii cosmologies can be described by the following set of expansion - normalized variables : @xmath16 subject to one constraint of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is given by , i.e. @xmath19 here @xmath20 are _ shear variables _ , @xmath21 is a _ spatial curvature variable _ and @xmath22 is a _",
    "tilt variable_. these variables determine the density parameter @xmath23 and the shear parameter @xmath24 according to , and .",
    "as mentioned at the end of appendix a , we regard the off - diagonal shear variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 as representing the two tilt degrees of freedom .    the evolution equations for the variables , as derived in appendix a , are given below : @xmath27 where @xmath28.\\ ] ] the auxiliary equation for @xmath29 is @xmath30 \\omega .\\label{e2.4}\\ ] ]    the state space is the subset of @xmath31 defined by the constraint and the inequality @xmath32 , which by , and , is equivalent to @xmath33 this restriction , and the fact that @xmath34 , implies that the state space is bounded .",
    "the evolution equations are invariant under the transformations @xmath35 provided that the product @xmath36 does not change sign . in addition , it follows that @xmath37 and @xmath22 can not change sign along an orbit .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath38 taking these restrictions into account , the state space @xmath39 of the tilted perfect fluid bianchi ii cosmologies is defined by the inequalities @xmath40 the boundary @xmath41 is obtained by successively replacing the strict inequalities in by equalities .",
    "the evolution equations are an autonomous de in @xmath31 of the form @xmath42 where the function @xmath43 on the right side is a _ rational function _ ( note the function @xmath44 in the denominator in @xmath45 , and the form of the @xmath46 equation ) . for values of @xmath1 that satisfy @xmath47 , the two functions in the denominator are strictly positive on the physical state space @xmath39 and on its boundary @xmath41 .",
    "the de is thus smooth , indeed analytic , on the set @xmath48 .",
    "since this set is compact and invariant , the solutions of the de can be extended for all @xmath49 .",
    "the constraint entails a consistency requirement , namely that the equation @xmath50 should define an invariant set of the evolution equations .",
    "a straightforward calculation using - shows that @xmath51 it thus follows ( see [ 4 ] , proposition 4.1 on page 29 ) that @xmath52 does indeed define an invariant set .    in analyzing a class of bianchi cosmologies ,",
    "one typically finds that the orbits in the _ boundary of the state space _ play a significant role in determining the dynamics , since orbits in the interior can shadow , page 104 . ]",
    "orbits in the boundary . for the tilted bianchi ii models , the boundary of the state space is the union of five disjoint invariant sets , as shown in table 2.1 .",
    "the invariant sets i)-iv ) describe familiar solutions but give multiple representations of them .",
    "for example , the orbits with @xmath53 in the invariant set i ) describe non - tilted bianchi ii cosmologies relative to a fermi - propagated frame , while the orbits with @xmath54 describe the same models , but relative to a rotating frame ( see ) .",
    "likewise , the orbits with @xmath55 in the invariant set ii ) describe ( nontilted ) bianchi i cosmologies relative to a fermi - propagated frame , while the orbits with @xmath54 and/or @xmath56 describe the same models , but relative to a rotating frame .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table ii : local sinks in the tilted bianchi ii state space .",
    "we can describe the mechanisms for these bifurcations , without giving full details , as follows .",
    "the linearization of the evolution equation for @xmath21 at @xmath57 is @xmath58 showing that the spatial curvature variable @xmath21 destabilizes @xmath57 at @xmath59 .",
    "the associated eigenvector is @xmath60 in .",
    "the linearizations of the evolution equations for @xmath25 and @xmath22 at pii are @xmath61 showing that @xmath22 and @xmath25 destabilize pii at @xmath62 .",
    "the associated physical eigenspace is actually one - dimensional and the eigenvector is @xmath63 .",
    "finally , the linearization of @xmath64 at pii@xmath65 is @xmath66 showing that @xmath26 destabilizes pii@xmath65 at @xmath67 .",
    "stability is transferred from pii@xmath65 to pi@xmath68 through the line of equilibrium points @xmath69ii@xmath65 , which exists only for @xmath67 .",
    "we shall refer to the bifurcation at @xmath70 as _ the spatial curvature bifurcation _ , and , in view of the fact that @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the tilt degrees freedom , we shall refer to the bifurcations at @xmath62 and @xmath71 as _ the first and second tilt bifurcations_.    as regards local sources , it turns out that unless @xmath72 , none of the equilibrium points or equilibrium sets is a local source .",
    "this result follows from a careful analysis of the eigenvalues associated with the equilibrium points and sets .",
    "if @xmath72 , it turns out that a subset of the jacobs disc shown as the shaded region in figure i , is a local source .",
    "the shaded region , a subset of the jacobs disc , is a local source in the case @xmath73 .",
    "it is of interest to consider the invariant subset defined by @xmath53 , which describes the evolution of models with one tilt degree of freedom . for these models",
    "an analysis of the eigenvalues shows that there is an arc of the kasner circle @xmath74 , defined by @xmath75 , @xmath76 , that is a local source .",
    "we have seen that for each value of @xmath1 in the range @xmath77 , excluding @xmath71 , there is a unique equilibrium point that is a local sink of the evolution equations , while if @xmath67 , there is an arc of equilibrium points that is a local sink .",
    "these local sinks are listed in table 3.1 , and the bifurcations that occur as @xmath1 increases are displayed in equation . by definition of local sink ,",
    "any orbit that enters a sufficiently small neighbourhood of the sink approaches the sink as @xmath78 .",
    "the monotone functions in appendix b , and numerical simulations , provide strong evidence that _ for a given value of @xmath1 the local sink is the future attractor of the evolution equation _",
    ", i.e. all orbits , except possibly a set of measure zero , approach the local sink as @xmath79 .",
    "the main conclusion that can be drawn from this asymptotic result is that the dynamical significance of the tilt and the shear at late times increases as the equation of state parameter increases from 0 to 2 , as follows :    * in the range @xmath80 the models isotropize , and since the deceleration parameter is asymptotically negative ( i.e. @xmath81 ) , the models are inflationary , * at @xmath70 the spatial curvature destabilizes the flat fl equilibrium point , and for @xmath82 the models no longer isotropize , * at @xmath62 , the tilt destabilizes the collins - stewart solution , and for @xmath83 , the models are asymptotically tilted at late times , and * if @xmath84 , the tilt is asymptotically extreme @xmath85 at late times .",
    "the @xmath1-dependent limits of the dimensionless shear scalar @xmath24 and the tilt variable @xmath86 , as defined by , can be obtained from the list of equilibrium points in section 3 . in the physically important cases of dust @xmath87 and radiation @xmath88 , which satisfy @xmath89 , the models are asymptotic to the collins - stewart solution",
    "i.e. they do not isotropize @xmath90 , but the tilt becomes dynamically negligible @xmath91 , at late times .",
    "as mentioned in section 3 , there is no equilibrium point or equilibrium set that is a local source , except in the special case @xmath72 , or unless one restricts consideration to models with only one tilt degree of freedom ( the invariant set @xmath53 ) .",
    "the implication of this fact is that _ a typical orbit is not past asymptotic to an equilibrium point_. the situation is analogous to the case of non - tilted sh cosmologies of bianchi types viii and ix ( see [ 4 ] , section 6.4 ) , for which it has been shown that there exist _ infinite heteroclinic sequences _ based on the circle @xmath92 of kasner equilibrium points , i.e. infinite sequences of equilibrium points on @xmath92 , joined by special heteroclinic orbits directed into the past ( see [ 15 ] and [ 4 ] , section 6.4.2 , for a geometrical description of these heteroclinic sequences ) .",
    "these heteroclinic sequences determine the dynamics in the singular regime @xmath93 in the sense that a typical orbit shadows - limit set of a typical orbit . for recent progress in proving the existence of the @xmath94-limit set",

    "the heteroclinic sequences contain orbits that join two points on @xmath92 , orbits that join two points on @xmath96 , and orbits that join a point on @xmath92 to a point on @xmath96 , and vice versa .",

    "the projections of these orbits in the @xmath108-plane are shown in figure ii , with the arrows showing evolution into the past .",
    "we note that the orbits i ) describe the taub vacuum solutions of bianchi type ii ( see [ 4 ] , page 137 ) , while the orbits ii ) and iii ) describe the kasner vacuum solutions relative to a rotating frame ( i.e. the angular velocity @xmath109 of the spatial frame is non - zero ; see appendix a ) .",

    "it is not our intention to describe the detailed structure of the heteroclinic sequences , as has been done in the case of the non - tilted models of bianchi types viii and ix ( see the references at the beginning of this section ) .",
    "we simply wish to point out that _ the evolution of tilted cosmologies of bianchi type ii in the singular asymptotic regime is governed by infinite heteroclinic sequences based on the kasner vacuum models_.    the case @xmath72 is exceptional in that there is a local source , namely a subset of the jacobs disc ( see figure i ) .",
    "we thus conjecture that a typical orbit with @xmath72 is past asymptotic to an equilibrium point in this set .",

    "we conclude this section by comparing our description of the oscillatory behaviour in the singular regime using dynamical systems methods in the expansion - normalized state - space with the descriptions provided by the hamiltonian approach ( see [ 18 ] and [ 19 ] , pages 63 - 4 ) and by the so - called bkl approach ( [ 20 ] , pages 533 - 8 ) .    for the class of non - tilted sh models of bianchi types viii and ix this oscillatory behaviour",
    "is described as a succession of    * bounces off bianchi type ii potential walls , in the hamiltonian approach , * changes of the kasner exponents as described by the bkl map ( see [ 4 ] , page 236 ) , in the bkl approach , and * vacuum bianchi ii orbits ( taub orbits ) linking kasner equilibrium points in the expansion - normalized state - space .",
    "the presence of tilt leads to a new dynamical phenomenon which is due to the occurrence of off - diagonal shear degrees of freedom , and which is described in the above three approaches as follows :    * bounces off `` centrifugal '' potential walls in the hamiltonian approach ( see [ 21 ] , pages 132 - 4 ) , * rotation of the kasner axes , thereby permuting the kasner exponents , in the bkl approach ( see [ 22 ] , pages 640 - 7 ) , and * non - singular kasner orbits that link physically equivalent kasner equilibrium points ( see figure ii , ii ) and iii ) ) in the expansion - normalized state - space .    in the expansion - normalized state space ,",
    "the presence of tilt leads to an additional new phenomenon , namely _ transitions between states with zero tilt and states with extreme tilt _ , described by the non - singular kasner orbits that link equilibrium points on @xmath74 and @xmath110 ( see figure iii ) .",
    "these orbits , that describe changes in the dynamical significance of the tilt during the oscillatory regime , do not appear to have an analogue in the other two approaches .",
    "in this paper we have introduced expansion - normalized variables to describe the evolution of tilted sh models of bianchi type ii , and have shown that with this choice of variable , the einstein field equations reduce to an autonomous de on a five dimensional compact subset of @xmath31 . since the state space is compact , the orbits of the de have a well - defined asymptotic behaviour as the dimensionless time @xmath124 tends to @xmath125 .",
    "this property enabled us to give a detailed description of the dynamics of the above class of models in the late time regime ( see section 4 ) and on approach to the initial singularity ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the description is incomplete in one respect , namely , that we have not discussed the kinematical properties of the cosmological fluid . for a non - tilted sh cosmology",
    "the only non - zero kinematical quantities of the fluid congruence are the rate of expansion and the rate of shear , since the acceleration and vorticity are necessarily zero [ 12 ] . on the other hand , in a tilted sh cosmology ,",
    "all four kinematical quantities of the fluid congruence are non - zero in general [ 2 ] .",
    "it is essential to keep in mind , however , that in our analysis , the dimensionless shear variables and the hubble scalar @xmath126 describe the kinematics of the timelike congruence that is normal to the group orbits .",
    "the kinematical quantities of the fluid congruence can be expressed in terms of the variables by adapting the formulas in [ 2 ] ( see sections 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the desired relations , valid for all bianchi types , are given in appendix c , and can easily be specialized to models of bianchi type ii .",

    "we refer to [ 7 ] ( page 53 ) and [ 23 ] , for alternative descriptions . ] since equilibrium points correspond to self - similar solutions of the einstein field equations , one says that _ the models are asymptotically self - similar at the initial singularity @xmath93 and at late times _ @xmath128 .",
    "the initial asymptotic state is typically a kasner solution and the late time asymptotic state is the collins - stewart perfect fluid solution .",
    "we have seen that a bianchi ii model can in general accommodate two tilt degrees of freedom , described by the two off - diagonal shear variables @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",

    "the above results lead to some interesting comparisons concerning the ways in which various anisotropies , in particular , _ spatial curvature , magnetic fields _ and _ tilt _ , affect the dynamics of sh cosmologies .",
    "it is known that the anisotropic spatial curvature in a sh cosmology , as described by the variables @xmath134 , @xmath135 , affects the stability of the circle of kasner equilibrium points ( see [ 4 ] , page 132 ) . if all of the @xmath134 are non - zero , corresponding to models of bianchi types viii and ix , all kasner points become saddles , leading to the existence of infinite heteroclinic sequences into the past , and hence an oscillatory singular regime .",
    "it has also been found that magnetic fields affect the kasner equilibrium points in an analogous way , although the mechanism is somewhat different in that a magnetic field with more than one degree of freedom generates off - diagonal shear components .",
    "we refer to [ 24]-[27 ] for details .",
    "the present paper shows that in sh models of bianchi type ii , the tilt degrees of freedom affect the kasner circle in the same way by generating off - diagonal shear components , leading to an oscillatory singular regime .",
    "since bianchi ii orbits are contained in the boundary of the state space of models of more general bianchi type ( all except types i and v ) , we expect that this mechanism will operate quite generally for tilted bianchi models .",
    "there are also analogies in the way in which anisotropic spatial curvature , magnetic fields and tilt affect the dynamics of sh cosmologies at late times . if the equation of state parameter satisfies @xmath80 , then all orbits are asymptotic in the future to the flat fl equilibrium point @xmath57 , implying that the models isotropize . since in this case",
    "the limit of the deceleration parameter @xmath45 is negative @xmath136 , the models are inflationary .",
    "for each of the three types of anisotropy , bifurcations occur as @xmath1 increases , the result of which is that these anisotropies influence the dynamics to an increasing degree at late times .",

    "ii and vi@xmath137 destabilizes these new equilibrium points , with the result that the magnetic field becomes dynamically significant ( see [ 24]-[25 ] ) . in this paper we have shown that the tilt in a bianchi ii model acts in a similar way , becoming dynamically significant if @xmath83",
    ".    there is , however , an important difference between the effect of tilt in a sh model of bianchi type ii and the effect of spatial curvature and magnetic fields .",
    "we have mentioned that the spatial curvature destabilizes the flat fl point @xmath57 at @xmath138 .",
    "it has also been shown that a magnetic field leads to a second destabilization of @xmath57 at @xmath10 ( see [ 26 ] ) . on the other hand",

    "the flat fl equilibrium point @xmath57 is stable with respect to the off - diagonal shear degrees of freedom that arise in the presence of tilt_. in the language of dynamical systems the tilt increases the dimension of the stable manifold of the equilibrium point @xmath57 making it more likely that orbits will pass close to @xmath57 .",
    "the physical significance of this result is that _ in bianchi ii models tilt increases the probability of intermediate isotropization with @xmath139_. whether this result is true in general for tilted sh models requires further investigation .",
    "in this appendix we derive the evolution equations - for the tilted sh models of bianchi type ii .",
    "we begin by giving the evolution equations for a general sh model , in terms of expansion - normalized variables defined relative to the timelike congruence that is normal to the group orbits .",
