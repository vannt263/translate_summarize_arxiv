    "ag dra is the well - studied symbiotic binary consisting of a high - velocity , metal - poor , bright k - type giant and a hot white dwarf companion ( e.g. mikoajewska et al .",
    "1995 ; smith et al .",
    "the binary system has an orbital period of 549 days and a well - defined spectroscopic orbit ( fekel et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "ag dra is also among the most active symbiotic stars .",
    "its optical light curve is characterized by a series of active ( outbursts ) and quiescent phases ( e.g. fig .",
    "7 of glis et al .",
    "although the activity of ag dra , and other classical symbiotic stars is still poorly understood , multifrequency observations covering a few whole activity cycles indicate that in ag dra this activity is related to changes of both radius and temperature of the hot component ( e.g. mikoajewska et al . 1995 ; greiner et al .",
    "ag dra is also one of 10 known galactic supersoft x - ray sources ( greiner et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "recently , the star has been searched , together with all the northern supersoft x - ray sources , for radio emission at 5 and 8.4 ghz ( ogley et al .",
    "2002 , hereafer o02 ) .",
    "the observations by merlin telescope have confirmed previous vla detections .",
    "moreover , the source has been resolved at the milliarcsec scale into two components of nearly equal brightness , and combined flux of @xmath0 mjy . o02",
    "have also studied possible interpretations of this emission in terms of a wind environment from either the cool giant or the hot white dwarf .",
    "they have concluded that all their scenarios give the radio emission fluxes an order of amplitude lower than the observed value .    in the following we reanalyze a possible origin of the resolved radio emission from various wind environment , and",
    "show that it presumably arises from jet(s ) ejected from the hot component during its recent series of outbursts .",
    "we point out here that o02 have adopted unreasonably low values for both the cool giant wind and the hot component luminosity in their analysis . below in this section",
    ", we provide a critical analysis of their assumptions and calculations .",
    "the wind environment of ag dra has been discussed in several papers , and estimates for the mass loss from both components are available .",
    "all these estimates have been based on the assumption of an isothermal , spherically symmetric steady flow . in particular , the mm - submm radio spectrum and @xmath1 $ ] colour excess are both consistent with the cool giant mass - loss rate , @xmath2 ( mikoajewska , ivison & omont 2002 ; kenyon 1988 ) , whereas the uv continuum and emission line analysis ( mrset et al . 1991 ) gave @xmath3 , in all cases values two orders of magnitude _ larger _ than @xmath4 adopted by o02 . using the wright & barlow ( 1975 ) formula for completely ionized wind ,",
    "the first estimate above gives a flux at 5 ghz of @xmath5 mjy _ independent _ of the adopted distance .",
    "thus , the cool component wind could , in principle , account for the observed intensity of the radio emission but not for the double structure .",
    "we also find an error in the value of irradiation luminosity adopted by o02 in their estimate for the mass loss rate in the cool giant due to irradiation by its hot companion , @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 in units of @xmath8 ; their eq .",
    "( 3 ) and table 2 ) .",
    "this error apparently stems from a mistake in rescaling results of greiner ( 2000 ) to @xmath9 used by o02 .",
    "the rescaling gives in fact @xmath10 .",
    "using eq.(3 ) of o02 with more realistic values , namely @xmath11 ( e.g. greiner et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 kpc and @xmath14 adopted by o02 from tomov , tomova & ivanova ( 2000 ) are mutually inconsistent given the observed near ir magnitudes , colours and spectral classification of the giant .",
    "namely , if we accept @xmath14 , we obtain ( using the barnes - evans relation , cahn 1980 , with the surface brightness appropriate for a mid k - type giant and the observed @xmath15 , e.g. belczyski et al .",
    "2000 ) @xmath16 kpc , even more discrepant with our preferred value of @xmath17 . ]",
    "( mikoajewska et al . 1995 ) , we find the mass loss rate for the evaporated wind , @xmath18 , and the predicted quiescent 5 ghz flux of @xmath19 mjy . this radio flux can be further increased by increasing the hot component luminosity ( e.g. mikoajewska et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found an order of magnitude increase in @xmath20 due to activity ) , however , this model still does not account for the double source structure .    concluding this section , the resolved radio emission from ag dra detected by merlin",
    "can not be interpreted in terms of the spherically symmetric steady wind from the cool giant .",
    "we note , however , that the _ hipparcos _ position of ag dra ( perryman et al . 1997 ) practically coincides with that of the n1 component in the merlin image .",
    "this indicates that the n1 component can , in principle , originate in the cool giant wind .",
    ".history of radio observations of ag dra [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the active phases of ag dra are characterized by an increase of the emission line widths and marked p cyg structure of high ionization uv lines ( e.g. nv ) , which indicate outflow velocities of @xmath21@xmath22 ( mikoajewska et al .",
    "1995 , and references therein ) , while the optical heii and hi balmer lines develop broad emission wings ( e.g. tomova & tomov 1999 ) .",
    "this behaviour suggests that the hot component develops a significant wind in outburst .",
    "tomova & tomov ( 1999 ) estimated the wind velocity of @xmath23 and the mass loss rate of @xmath24 from the broad wings of h@xmath25 and h@xmath26 profiles observed during the 1995 outburst .",
    "their estimate made use of the distance - dependent estimate for the hot component radius of mikoajewska et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and thus it corresponds to @xmath27 kpc .",
    "it was also based on the assumption of the spherically symmetric steady wind which is probably not true for the hot component wind developed during the outburst . anyway , applying the wright & barlow formula ( 1975 ) , such a wind should give rise to the radio flux of @xmath28 at 5 ghz , again much lower than the flux observed by o02 .",
    "although only a few attempts have been made to observe ag dra at radio wavelenghts , it seems that the radio emission may be variable , and possibly related to the hot component activity ( table 1 ) .",
    "ag dra was not detected at 4.9 ghz on jd 2445006 ( seaquist & taylor 1990 ) when the star was at maximum of a large eruption ( see the light curves in mikoajewska et al .",
    "1995 , and glis et al .",
    "1999 ) , whereas it was detected at 3 epochs ( torbett & campbell 1987 ; seaguist & taylor 1990 ) during less pronounced burst and its decline a few years later .",
    "it is particularly important that ag dra was not detected on jd 2448290 , when the star was in quiescent phase , by the highly sensitive vla survey at 8.3 ghz ( seaquist et al .",
    "1993 ) , and the @xmath29 upper limit for the 8.3 ghz flux of @xmath30 was much lower than the 5 ghz fluxes of any of the two radio components detected by o02 .",
    "the hot component entered another large outburst in 1995 , which was followed by a series of more or less prominent bursts of activity till at least the end of 1999 .",
    "it is interesting that there are two kinds of outbursts : stronger , cool outbursts during which the hot component temperature decreases , and fainter , hot outbursts during which it increases ( gonzlez - riestra et al . 1999 ; mikoajewska et al .",
    "the temperature decrease during the strong cool outbursts is very likely due to slow expansion of the hot component to about 23 times its original size ( mikoajewska et al .",
    "1995 ; greiner et al . 1997 ) and possible development of an optically thick wind .",
    "all the previous radio detections were made during hot outbursts .",
    "moreover , in 1997 and 1998 , ag dra was detected at 1.3 and 0.85 mm by the iram and jmct telescopes , respectively ( mikoajewska et al . 2002 ) . at the time of both detections",
    "ag dra was at the hot activity stage .",
    "the fact that the radio emission is resolved into two compact components raises an interesting possibility that it originates in jets ejected from ag dra .",
    "bipolar jets have been detected in a few symbiotic systems , e.g. in v694mon , ch cyg , hen3 - 1341 and stha190 ( belczyski et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ; tomov , munari & maresse 2000 ; munari et al .",
    "2001 ) , and in all cases they have been associated with the hot component outbursts and an appearance of a high - velocity stellar wind .",
    "a relation between the radio emission and the hot component activity stage has been also found in another symbiotic binary , ci cyg .",
    "the cm - submm spectrum of ci cyg is inconsistent with predictions of any model involving spherically symmetric wind(s ) , and the radio emission most likely originates from a bipolar outflow ( mikoajewska & ivison 2001 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the relationship between the binary geometry and the resolved merlin image of ag dra . from the data in table 1 of o02 , we have estimated a separation of the components , @xmath31 arcsec , and a position angle of the whole structure , @xmath32 . from spectropolarimetry we know the binary orbit orientation , @xmath33 , as well as the orbit inclination , @xmath34 ( schmid & schild 1997 ) .",
    "thus the two radio components are within the observational errors aligned with the binary axis ( @xmath35 ; fig .  1 ) .",
    "moreover , the possible extended emission reported by torbett & campbell ( 1987 ) has similar orientation .",
    "the separation of the two radio components resolved by merlin corresponds to @xmath36\\ , \\rm a.u.$ ] assuming that they have been ejected perpendicularly to the orbital plane with a velocity of the order of the escape velocity from the hot component , @xmath37 for @xmath38@xmath39 , and @xmath40 at the maximum of the large otbursts ( mikoajewska et al .",
    "1995 ; greiner et al .",
    "1997 ) , this separation implies that the ejection took place @xmath41 years before the merlin observations , possibly during the recent 199598 series of outbursts .",
    "the major results and conclusions of this paper can be summarised as follows :        \\(iii ) the two radio components resolved by merlin ( o02 ) are practically aligned with the binary axis of ag dra . the possible extended radio emission reported by torbett & campbell ( 1987 ) has similar orientation .",
    "the resolved radio emission presumably originates in jets ejected from the binary system .",
    "\\(iv ) assuming that the jet velocity is of order of the escape velocity of the hot component , the separation between the two radio sources indicates that the ejection took place @xmath42 yr earlier , and it was associated with the recent series of outbursts .",
