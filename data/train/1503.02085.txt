    "few agns are found to be intrinsically x - ray weak , i.e. , producing much less x - ray emission than expected from the relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the best - studied intrinsically x - ray weak agn is the type 1 quasar phl  1811 , a very bright ( @xmath11 ) radio - quiet quasar at @xmath12 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is weak by a factor of relative to expectations from the relation , and its x - ray weakness is likely intrinsic instead of being due to absorption given its canonical x - ray spectrum ( power - law photon index @xmath13 ) , lack of detectable photoelectric x - ray absorption , and short timescale x - ray variability @xcite .",
    "interestingly , phl  1811 also has an unusual uv spectrum @xcite , which is dominated by strong fe@xmath2ii and fe@xmath2iii emission with very weak high - ionization lines .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width ( rew ) of the c@xmath2iv  @xmath10 line ( 6.6   ) is a factor of @xmath8 times smaller than that measured from quasar composite spectra ( 30   ) ; this line is also blueshifted ( by @xmath14  km  s@xmath9 ) and asymmetric , indicative of a wind component in the broad emission - line region ( belr ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "based on photoionization modeling , @xcite suggested that many of the unusual emission - line properties of phl  1811 are a result of the soft optical - to - x - ray ionizing continuum caused by the intrinsic x - ray weakness .",
    "the intriguing possible connection between the extreme emission - line and x - ray properties of phl  1811 prompted a search for more such x - ray weak quasars using uv emission - line selection criteria ( @xcite , hereafter w11 ) .",
    "a pilot sample of eight type 1 , radio - quiet , non - bal quasars with phl  1811-like emission - line properties ( including small c@xmath2iv rews , large c@xmath2iv blueshifts , and strong fe@xmath2ii and fe@xmath2iii emission ) , termed phl  1811 analogs , were selected for study .",
    "all of them turned out to be x - ray weak , by factors of @xmath15 to @xmath16 , confirming the empirical link between the weakness and unusual uv emission - line properties .",
    "however , an stacking analysis revealed a hard spectrum on average for this sample , albeit with a large uncertainty , suggesting that unlike phl  1811 itself that appears to be intrinsically x - ray weak , these phl  1811 analogs may often be x - ray absorbed .",
    "more phl  1811 analogs selected in addition to the eight w11 pilot objects are clearly required to constrain better the nature of these extreme quasars .",
    "there is another small population of type 1 quasars that have and uv emission - line properties overlapping with those of the phl  1811 analogs : radio - quiet weak emission - line quasars ( wlqs ) .",
    "strong broad emission lines in the optical and uv are a characteristic feature of radio - quiet quasars .",
    "it was thus surprising when @xcite discovered the first wlq pg  1407 + 265 , with unusually weak ly@xmath17 , c@xmath2iv  @xmath10 , c@xmath2iii ]  @xmath18 , and h@xmath19 lines . with the large spectroscopic quasar sample provided by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) ,",
    "more wlqs were discovered .",
    "these were originally at @xmath20 where ly@xmath17 coverage is available ( @xmath21 wlqs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) requiring weak c@xmath2iv and/or other lines at longer wavelengths .",
    "the fraction of x - ray weak quasars among either the high - redshift or lower - redshift wlqs is high ( @xmath23 ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter w12 ) , again suggesting a link between the weak uv line emission and x - ray weakness .    based on the overall similarities between the phl  1811 analogs and x - ray weak wlqs , w11 argued that phl  1811 analogs are a subset of wlqs , despite small technical differences in their uv line rew selection criteria.iv rew @xmath24   , while the wlqs in the w11 study were from the @xcite catalog which requires rew @xmath25    for all uv emission features ( e.g. , c@xmath2iv , c@xmath2iii ] , and mg@xmath2ii ) .",
    "no apparent difference was found between the phl  1811 analogs having @xmath26    c@xmath2iv rews and those having 510    c@xmath2iv rews .",
    "therefore , the different rew criteria were considered a technical selection effect and the wlq criterion could be relaxed to c@xmath2iv rew @xmath24   , which is the lower 3@xmath27 limit of the log - normal c@xmath2iv rew distribution ( @xcite ; w12 ) .",
    "[ footnote - sel ] ] wlqs contain both x - ray normal and x - ray weak quasars ( we adopt an x - ray weakness factor of 3.3 as the dividing threshold between x - ray weak and x - ray normal quasars ; see section  [ sec - aox ] below ) , while phl  1811 analogs are likely weak wlqs due to the additional selection criteria of strong uv fe emission and large c@xmath2iv blueshift ( w11 ; w12 ) . a larger sample of phl  1811 analogs than the pilot sample of eight would help examine further the above suggested connection .    except for the unusual uv emission - line and x - ray properties ,",
    "the phl  1811 analogs and wlqs appear to be typical quasars in terms of other observable multiwavelength properties ( e.g. , @xcite ; w11 ; w12 ) .",
    "various explanations have been proposed for the nature of the phl  1811 analogs and wlqs , such as an anemic belr where there is a significant deficit of line - emitting gas in the belr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a brief evolutionary stage where the belr is not fully developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a soft ionizing spectral energy distribution ( sed ) produced by the cold accretion disk of a very massive black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a soft ionizing continuum due to intrinsic weakness ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) , and a soft ionizing continuum due to small - scale absorption ( e.g. , w11 ; w12 )",
    ". however , for the general population of phl  1811 analogs and wlqs , the absorption - induced soft ionizing continuum appears the most likely scenario , based on systematic studies , albeit using small samples , of their x - ray and multiwavelength properties ( e.g. , w11 ; w12 ) .",
    "a small - scale `` shielding gas '' scenario was proposed in w11 to explain and unify phl  1811 analogs and wlqs , which was broadly motivated by the shielding gas generally required in the disk - wind model for bal quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the w11 scenario , some shielding gas interior to the belr shields all or most of the belr from the nuclear ionizing continuum , resulting in the observed weak uv emission lines .",
    "if our line of sight intersects the x - ray absorbing shielding gas , a phl  1811 analog or an x - ray weak wlq is observed ; if not , an x - ray normal wlq is observed .",
    "since bal quasars were excluded in the selection of phl  1811 analogs and wlqs , the inclination angle ( with respect to disk normal ) should probably still be relatively small so that the line of sight does not intercept the ( often equatorial ) disk wind which would produce bals in the observed spectra .",
    "the reason this shielding gas is unusually effective at screening the belr in the phl  1811 analogs and wlqs remains uncertain , but it should be a rare occurrence given the small numbers of phl  1811 analogs and wlqs discovered .    the fractions of phl  1811 analogs and wlqs among typical quasars are small , @xmath28 ( w11 ) .",
    "however , studies of rare and extreme objects often clearly reveal phenomena that are more generally applicable , as such effects are more difficult to identify in the overall population ( cf .",
    "we shall indeed argue the case for such generality later in this paper ( see section  6.3 below ) . with the pilot studies of w11 and w12 examining systematically the x - ray and emission - line properties of phl  1811 analogs and wlqs",
    ", progress has been made toward understanding the nature of these extreme quasars ( e.g. , the w11 shielding - gas scenario ) .",
    "however , the small x - ray sample available in their work , with only eight phl  1811 analogs and 11 radio - quiet wlqs ( which are also divided into x - ray weak and x - ray normal categories for the case of wlqs ) , limited further investigations . a larger sample is critically needed to reduce the uncertainties of stacking and joint spectral analyses , examine correlations between the degree of x - ray weakness and emission - line properties ,",
    "assess why phl  1811 analogs are preferentially x - ray weak , and further explore the shielding - gas scenario .",
    "as an extension of the w11 and w12 work , we present here an x - ray and multiwavelength study of 18 phl  1811 analogs and 33 wlqs , including 33 objects with new _",
    "chandra _  observations .",
    "we describe the sample selection and _ chandra _   data analysis in sections 2 and 3 , respectively . the multiwavelength properties , including the @xmath3 parameters , continuum seds , and radio properties , are presented in section  4 . in section  5 ,",
    "we perform x - ray stacking and joint spectral analyses , estimate eddington ratios , construct composite sdss spectra , and identify spectral indicators for the x - ray weak subsample . in section  6",
    ", we discuss the unification of the x - ray weak and x - ray normal phl  1811 analogs and wlqs under the w11 shielding - gas scenario , and we propose that a geometrically thick inner accretion disk may act as the shielding gas in the general population of phl  1811 analogs and wlqs .",
    "we summarize in section  7 .",
    "we caution that , consistent with the exploratory nature of this work , the phl  1811 analogs and wlqs could be a heterogeneous population .",
    "the discussions and conclusions are mainly applicable to the general population of phl  1811 analogs and wlqs , and we acknowledge that other explanations are possible for a fraction of our sample . we also stress that phl  1811 analogs were selected based on their phl  1811-like uv emission - line properties , and they are not necessarily intrinsically x - ray weak like phl  1811 itself .",
    "in fact , the x - ray weakness of phl  1811 analogs is likely caused by absorption , based on the studies of w11 and our work here . throughout this paper , we use j2000 coordinates and a cosmology with @xmath29  km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "therefore , the observed x - ray emission from these objects is likely dominated by indirect , reflected / scattered instead of transmitted emission through the disk .",

    "if our line of sight is close to the edge of the inner bulge of the puffed - up disk in some objects , a small change in the covering factor of the inner disk due to , e.g. , accretion - disk instability could result in transitions between weak and normal states on timescales of years .",
    "such a phenomenon may have been observed in the @xmath197 quasar phl  1092 .",

    "further x - ray monitoring observations of phl  1811 analogs and wlqs are required to constrain the frequency and duration of such transitions , which may be a useful probe of the geometrically thick disk scenario .      based on our geometrically thick disk scenario for phl  1811",
    "analogs and wlqs , these extreme and rare quasars are likely not a distinct population , but are instead extreme members of the continuous population of quasars .",
    "the shielding effect from a puffed - up inner disk likely exists beyond these extreme objects , and it might be applicable at a milder level to quasars with lower eddington ratios ; in either the slim - disk model or the @xcite simulations , the disk is unlikely as thin and flat as what a standard disk model describes as long as @xmath191 .",
    "when the eddington ratio is smaller than those of phl  1811 analogs and wlqs , the radius and scale height of the puffed - up disk decreases , and its covering factor to the belr also decreases , leading to a larger c@xmath2iv rew than those of phl  1811 analogs and wlqs .    given a continuously varying covering factor of the inner disk that is @xmath152 dependent , a substantial fraction of the quasar c@xmath2iv",
    "rew distribution ( spanning about two orders of magnitude ; figure  [ fig - vc4]a ) could be governed by the eddington ratio .",
    "additional factors shaping this distribution include anisotropic continuum emission , anisotropic line emission , gas metallicity , c@xmath2iv belr geometry ( setting the fraction of ionizing radiation that is captured ) , and potential self - shadowing of the belr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , shielding of the nuclear x - ray emission can prevent the disk wind from being overionized and help the launching of the wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a larger covering factor of the geometrically thick disk ( larger @xmath152 ) could thus produce a stronger outflowing wind and result in a larger c@xmath2iv blueshift .",
    "the distribution of quasar c@xmath2iv blueshifts ( figure  [ fig - vc4]a ) could thus also be partly explained by the disk shielding scenario .",
    "we investigated the x - ray weak quasar diagnostics discovered in section  [ sec - weakdiag ] , and found that they can be plausibly fitted into the w11 shielding - gas scenario , where the x - ray weak objects are viewed at larger inclination angles than the x - ray normal objects .",
    "the redder @xmath55 color of the x - ray weak population can be explained by mild excess intrinsic reddening ( @xmath199  mag ; section  [ sec - compspec ] ) if the dust tends to reside in the equatorial plane of the quasar ( e.g. , in a dust - driven outer wind scenario as discussed by @xcite ) which leads to more extinction at larger inclination angles .",
    "another possible scenario is that the accretion - disk emission is not isotropic ( e.g. , from a puffed - up slim disk ; see section  [ sec - phy ] ) , and less uv emission is received at larger inclination angles , producing an intrinsically redder continuum .",
    "the larger rews of the uv lines ( c@xmath2iv , the @xmath52 complex , fe@xmath2iii , fe@xmath2ii , and mg@xmath2ii ) in the x - ray weak population compared to those in the x - ray normal population may be a consequence of the aspect dependent effects of accretion - disk emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the continuum flux from a standard accretion disk scales approximately as @xmath200 , where @xmath44 is the inclination angle of the disk @xcite . in the case of a slim disk ,",
    "the disk continuum emission is significantly anisotropic ( e.g. , see figure  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "the emission - line flux , on the other hand , is presumably from a belr structure which overall emits more isotropically .",
    "the resulting line rew thus depends on the inclination angle and may be increased by a factor of a few moving from a small angle for an x - ray normal wlq to a moderate angle for an x - ray weak wlq . in this scenario ,",
    "the ratios of the emission - line rews for the x - ray weak and normal populations should not differ significantly .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the distributions of the fe@xmath2ii to c@xmath2iv rew ratios for the two populations in our sample ( figure  [ fig - fe2c4ratio ] ) , which show no significant difference ( peto - prentice test @xmath170 ) .",
    "the theoretical angular dependence of disk continuum emission is slightly stronger toward longer wavelength in the uv ( e.g. , figure 32 of @xcite ) .",
    "the fe@xmath2ii emission is at a longer wavelength than the other studied uv lines except mg@xmath2ii , and it is also relatively stronger than the other weak uv lines in wlqs ( leading to more reliable measurements ) .",
    "these two factors combined probably cause the fe@xmath2ii rew to be the best x - ray weak quasar diagnostic among all the rews in our analysis ( c@xmath2iv , the @xmath52 complex , fe@xmath2iii , fe@xmath2ii , and mg@xmath2ii ) .",
    "the other two less - significant diagnostics of quasars , the c@xmath2iv blueshift ( 1.7@xmath27 ) and fwhm ( 2.2@xmath27 ) , can be generally incorporated in the w11 scenario considering that the c@xmath2iv line has an accelerating disk - wind origin so that the line may have both a larger blueshift and a larger velocity broadening if our line of sight is more aligned with directions along which the wind is strongly accelerated .",
    "a large c@xmath2iv blueshift was one of the selection criteria for our phl  1811 analogs , but it appears less efficient than the requirement of large uv fe@xmath2ii rew for selecting x - ray weak quasars ; the orientation - angle dependence of the line - of - sight wind velocity is probably less significant than the orientation - angle dependence of the line rews .",

    "wlqs do appear to be more common at higher redshifts from studies of limited wlq samples at @xmath576 @xcite . to test further this notion ,",
    "a large sample of wlqs selected systematically across a broad range of redshift is required .",
    "however , there is no simple way to define universal selection criteria for wlqs at all redshifts based solely on sdss spectroscopy due to the limited spectral coverage ( e.g. , section  3.2 of w12 ) . broader spectral coverage , such as nir spectra for high - redshift wlqs and uv spectra for low - redshift wlqs ,",
    "are needed to study the correlations of weak emission lines and thus define consistent selection criteria for wlqs at different redshifts .",
    "currently , only a small sample of wlqs have such broad spectral coverage ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and nir / uv spectroscopic observations of more wlqs are needed .",
    "moreover , given the unified nature of phl  1811 analogs and wlqs , the wlq selection criteria ( rew @xmath25    for all emission features ) should be relaxed to c@xmath2iv rew @xmath204   , which will allow the selection of a wlq sample that is more consistent with the selection of phl  1811 analogs .    if the distributions of quasar c@xmath2iv rews and blueshifts ( figure  [ fig - vc4]a ) are indeed partly the result of the varying covering factor of a geometrically thick disk ( which depends on the eddington ratio ) as we suggest in section  6.3 , we would also expect to see more quasars in general having smaller c@xmath2iv rews and larger c@xmath2iv blueshifts at higher redshifts due to the redshift evolution of the quasar eddington ratio .",
    "caution should be applied when performing such analyses as the c@xmath2iv rews and blueshifts might have other luminosity and/or redshift dependences ( e.g. , the baldwin effect ) .",
    "the most - luminous quasar at @xmath205 discovered recently is also a wlq @xcite , consistent with our expectation that the wlq fraction rises with redshift .",
    "it probably has a high or even super - eddington accretion rate , as we propose for wlqs ( section  6 ) ; a luminosity exceeding the eddington limit may help explain its very high luminosity .",
    "this quasar has a mg@xmath2ii - based virial mass of @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "however , as we discussed in section  5.3 , virial - mass estimates for these extreme quasars are highly uncertain and perhaps systematically in error ( e.g. , mg@xmath2ii - based virial masses are on average @xmath117 times larger than h@xmath19-based virial masses for five of our objects ) ; this factor could alleviate the challenge of growing such a massive black hole in the early universe .",
