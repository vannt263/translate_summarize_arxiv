    "<S> * tomography is the study of the properties of matter through the attenuation pattern of a calibrated flux of fast particles that lose energy via multiple elastic and inelastic scatterings . for ultrarelativistic heavy ion reactions this technique </S>",
    "<S> was first discussed for vector mesons but has only recently been generalized to hard partonic processes which dominate the experimentally accessible moderate- and high-@xmath0 region of hadron production  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the overlap function @xmath2 reflects the reaction geometry and the elementary nucleon - nucleon cross sections are calculable to leading and next - to - leading order  @xcite based on the successful perturbative qcd factorization approach  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the potentially dramatic observable effects of jet quenching  @xcite , @xmath3 , in @xmath4 versus @xmath5 collisions even for dynamically expanding systems come from the nuclear size enhancement @xmath6 and the large initial energy and parton number densities of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in the interaction region . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the suppression of the single inclusive spectra  @xcite and the disappearance of the back - to - back di - hadron correlations  @xcite in central and semi - central @xmath7 reactions , parton energy loss plays a major role in the generation of the high-@xmath0 azimuthal asymmetry  @xcite and the enhancement of the moderate-@xmath0 baryon to meson ratios  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the final state origin of many of these effects is now confirmed via the control @xmath8 measurement and its comparison to theoretical predictions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the first calculations of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) destructive interference effect in qcd  @xcite already indicated that medium induced non - abelian bremsstrahlung dominates over the elastic energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> the current techniques for the computation of the gluon radiative spectrum @xmath9 and the mean energy loss @xmath10 have been reviewed in  @xcite and include a path integral approach  @xcite , an effective 2d schredinger equation  @xcite , exact reaction operator formalism  @xcite and a twist expansion series  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for static non - abelian media the mean energy loss depends quadratically on the nuclear size , @xmath11 , and measures the gluon transport coefficient @xmath12 . in dynamically expanding plasmas the radiative spectrum and the mean energy loss </S>",
    "<S> can be related to the soft gluon rapidity density , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the outlined path length dependence holds for both small and large numbers of scatterings but @xmath14 is more sensitive to the few semihard kicks that hard partons undergo as they traverse the medium  @xcite . </S>",
