    "thanks to the excellent performances of the new generation of x  ray satellites both in terms of spatial resolution ( _ chandra _ ) and high energy throughput ( xmm_newton _ ) it has been possible to perform the deepest x  ray observations and almost completely resolve the 0.58 kev x  ray background ( xrb ) into single sources ( brandt et al .",
    "2001 ; giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) . although at the flux limits reached by deep _ chandra",
    "_ surveys a large variety of sources has been detected , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) provide the most important contribution to the overall energy budget of the hard xrb .",
    "the increasing observational evidence of a large population of obscured sources support the prediction of agn synthesis models for the x  ray background ( setti & woltjer 1989 ; comastri et al .",
    "1995 ; gilli et al .",
    "2001 ) . at this stage",
    "it seems obvious to conclude that there would be no other deep x ",
    "ray surveys if the origin of the xrb is considered a closed issue .    in the following",
    "we try to outline a few topics which would greatly benefit from further observations with a large collecting area x  ray facility such as xeus .",
    "the overall status of optical follow  up observations of x  ray sources is usually summarized by plots of the r  band magnitude versus the 210 kev x  ray flux ( figure  1 ) . the range of x  ray to optical flux ratios of spectroscopically identified agn is marked with the shaded area within 1 @xmath0 log@xmath1 1 ( maccacaro et al .",
    "this trend holds for a large number of sources over a broad range of fluxes .",
    "attention should be paid to those sources which deviate from log@xmath2 .",
    "the objects characterized by high values of @xmath3 are optically faint , sometimes below the limits of deep optical images .",
    "the spectroscopic identification of these objects is already challenging the capabilities of 810 m ground based telescopes .",
    "although obscured accretion seems to provide the most likely explanation for their x  ray to optical flux ratios distribution ( comastri , brusa & mignoli 2002 ) the observed properties are also consistent with those expected for high redshift ( possibly even @xmath4 ) quasars and cluster of galaxies at @xmath5 . + a not negligible number of x ",
    "ray sources have optical counterparts which are brighter than expected for agn and lie below log@xmath6 .",
    "the identification breakdown suggests that these objects are fairly normal galaxies and the x  ray emission is powered by processes associated with star formation , even though obscured accretion might be responsible of the peculiar broad band properties of a few of them ( comastri et al .",
    "for the purposes of the present discussion we have selected three different classes of hard x  ray selected sources which , in our opinion , deserve further investigation and would greatly benefit from deeper x  ray observations",
    ". an expanded view of their x  ray and optical fluxes is reported in figure 2 .",
    "the red asterisks in the upper part of the diagram correspond to extremely red objects ( eros ) , the cyan squares around log@xmath7 are x  ray bright optically normal galaxies ( aka xbong ; comastri et al .",
    "2002b ) , while the black circles in the lower left part are spectroscopically confirmed starburst galaxies .",
    "the bulk of the overall energy output of extremely red objects ( r  k @xmath8 5 or i ",
    "k @xmath8 4 ) is , almost by definition , in the near  infrared band .",
    "the red colors are consistent with those expected for passively evolving galaxies , dust  enshrouded starburst galaxies or reddened agn at @xmath9 1 .",
    "recent _ chandra _ and xmm_newton _ hard x  ray observations ( alexander et al .",
    "2002a , brusa et al .",
    "2002a , vignali et al . 2002 ) have proven to be very powerful in disentangling the various possibilities .",
    "the properties of x  ray detected eros are consistent with those of high redshift , luminous , obscured agn .",
    "therefore , hard x  ray selected eros have the properties of the so far elusive population of type 2 quasars predicted by the synthesis models and responsible for the energetically dominant component of the xrb . stacking analysis of those objects which are not individually detected",
    "suggests that , on average , star ",
    "forming systems are more luminous x  ray sources than passively evolving galaxies ( brusa et al .",
    "2002b ) .      the excellent spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ detectors allowed to unambiguosly identify an intriguing new class of x  ray sources ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "2001 , barger et al .",
    "they are found at moderately low redshift ( @xmath10 1 ) and are characterized by an absorption dominated optical spectrum and agn  like hard x  ray luminosities ( @xmath11 erg s@xmath12 ) .",
    "the average value of their log@xmath13 distribution is around @xmath14 with a large dispersion ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "an attempt to investigate their nature through a multiwavelength approach suggests that the putative agn responsible for the hard x  ray emission is completely hidden at longer wavelengths ( comastri et al . 2002b ) .",
    "it has been also suggested that the observed broad band properties can be explained by the presence of an heavily obscured ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) compton thick agn ( comastri , brusa and mignoli 2002 ) .",
    "it is well known that the radio and far  infrared luminosities of star  forming galaxies follow a tight linear relation .",
    "making use of a sample of nearby star  forming galaxies observed by asca and bepposax it has been shown that a linear relation holds also between the x  ray and both the radio and far  infrared bands ( ranalli , comastri & setti 2002 ) . such a relation has been extended to @xmath171 combining the 1 ms _ chandra _ deep field north exposures with deep 15@xmath18 m isocam ( alexander et al",
    ". 2002b ) and 1.4 ghz vla observations ( bauer et al .",
    "2002 ) and up to @xmath19 3 via stacking analysis of lyman break galaxies ( nandra et al .",
    "these results imply that the hard x  ray emission can be used as an absorption independent indicator of the star formation rate .",
    "+ moreover it is possible to compute the expected x  ray counts of star  forming galaxies from the log@xmath20log@xmath21 measured in deep radio surveys ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the number counts of star  forming galaxies begin to overcome agn counts at fluxes of the order of 10@xmath22 erg s@xmath12 @xmath16 .",
    "interesting enough the predictions are fully consistent with the constraints from fluctuation analysis in deep _",
    "chandra _ fields ( miyaji & griffiths 2002 ) and with the number counts expected by the x  ray binaries resulting from the peak in the cosmic star formation rate at @xmath231 ( ptak et al .",
    "the foreseen xeus capabilities in terms of collecting area will allow to obtain ( with exposure times ranging from 100 ks to 1 ms ) good quality x  ray spectra for almost all the x  ray sources discovered in the deepest _ chandra _ and xmm_newton _ surveys .",
    "given that most of these sources are likely to be the obscured agn responsible for the bulk of the hard x  ray background , it will be possible to completely characterize the cosmic history of accretion powered sources .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the detection of iron k@xmath24 features could provide the only method ( besides spectroscopy with 30100 m optical telescopes and the photometric technique ) to obtain a redshift estimate for those sources with extremely faint optical counterparts .",
    "the detection of x  ray sources will be pushed down to limiting fluxes of the order of a few @xmath25 erg s@xmath12 @xmath16 . at this level",
    "starburst galaxies will be detected in the x  ray band to at least @xmath193 , allowing to obtain an independent constraint on the cosmic star formation history to be compared with those obtained at longer wavelengths , and to investigate the connection with the onset and fueling of massive black holes .",
