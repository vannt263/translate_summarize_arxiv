    "collimated outflows , or jets , are observed from a wide range of accreting astronomical objects , starting from supermassive black holes ( bhs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) to protostars @xcite .",
    "this ubiquity along with the examples of association of accretion and jet launching in black hole systems @xcite and in agns @xcite strongly suggest that the accretion and the jet launching are coupled .",
    "although being a universal phenomenon this disk - jet coupling is a fundamental topic of interest in astrophysics , it is still poorly understood .",
    "jets from accreting compact stars ( stellar mass bhs , neutron stars ( nss ) , and even white dwarfs ( wds ) ) are additionally interesting , because they ( 1 ) are launched from regions of intense gravitational fields ; ( 2 ) are useful to probe much shorter timescales in comparison to those of agn jets ; and ( 3 ) can be used to probe the physics of accreting binaries .",
    "for example , although fossil jets have been observed from quiescent binaries , with luminosities that are several orders of magnitude lower than their bright - state luminosity @xcite , jets have not been observed to originate due to the quiescent activities . in binaries , jets in the x - ray wavelengths",
    "are known to originate from synchrotron and/or thermal bremsstrahlung emissions @xcite .",
    "the x - ray jets thus provide essential high energy information , which is complementary to that extracted from the more commonly encountered radio jets .",
    "jets are typically detected from resolved structures , or from spectral analysis @xcite",
    ". however , resolved x - ray jets from bh and ns binaries are rare , and the nearest of them is at least 4 kpc away from the sun @xcite .",
    "the nearest x - ray jets observed so far are from the symbiotic stars ( sss ) rh cygni @xcite and r aquarii @xcite , both located between 200250pc .",
    "we present observations which suggest that the x - ray jet from  is by far ( by more than one order of magnitude ) the nearest resolved x - ray jet from an accreting compact star that is not an ss .    the faint x - ray point source  with a prominent jet ( @xmath3 = 17@xmath4 23@xmath5 37532 , @xmath6 = -37344197 ) was discovered in a _",
    "chandra _ image in 2008 @xcite .",
    "however , this image alone was insufficient to either conclusively decide on the nature of the source , or to measure its distance .",
    "here we use a combination of photometric and spectroscopic observations in the optical and infrared ( ir ) in order to identify , as well as to measure its distance .",
    "we find that this source is a compact star accreting from a g9  v star located at a distance of 334@xmath060pc .",
    "the field containing the source cxo j172337.5 - 373442 was observed by the two legacy programs of _ spitzer _ : the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) using irac at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  and mipsgal , a 24 and 70 micron survey of the inner galactic disk with mips ; all data are available at the nasa / ipac infrared science archive ( irsa ) . using accurate photometric analysis",
    "we detect the source clearly in the 4 irac bands and do not detect it with mips at 24  .",
    "the mean position of the source in the 4 irac bands is @xmath3 = 17@xmath423@xmath5375 @xmath6 = 3734422 with an uncertainty of 1 .",
    "thus the position of the infrared source is in excellent agreement with the _ chandra _ point source discussed by @xcite .",
    "two 1800-s medium - resolution optical spectra between 3850 and 7200of  were acquired starting at 20:52 ut of 08 august 2009 with the 1.9-m  radcliffe \" telescope in sutherland , south africa .",
    "a spectrograph equipped with a 266@xmath71798  pixel site ccd is mounted at the cassegrain focus of this telescope . using the grating # 7 and a slit of 18 , we obtained a nominal spectral coverage between 3850 and 7200    and a dispersion of 2.3   / pix .    the spectra were optimally extracted @xcite using iraf after performing flat - fielding , bias - subtraction , cosmic ray rejection and background subtraction . on each spectrum",

    "we estimate the wavelength calibration uncertainty to be @xmath8 0.5   using the positions of background night sky lines .",
    "the two spectra were stacked together to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we acquired simultaneous photometric data ( tab.1 ) in seven optical and near - ir wavebands by observing  in @xmath9 , using gamma - ray burst optical / nearinfrared detector ( grond , @xcite ) mounted at the 2.2 m eso / mpi telescope at lasilla observatory ( chile ) .",

    "based on the mir photometry obtained with irac and mips we have obtained the following colours for : [ 3.6][4.5 ] = -0.26 , [ 5.8][8.0 ] = 0.28 , [ 3.6][5.8 ] = 0.22 and [ 8]-[24 ] = 1.98 . using the observed colours in the two diagnostic colour - colour diagrams [ 3.6][4.5 ] vs [ 5.8][8.0 ] and [ 3.6][5.8 ] vs [ 8.0]-[24 ] and comparing the regions occupied by the stellar and protostellar candidates ( cf .",
    "* ) we conclude that the source is definitely not a protostellar candidate , but rather shows colours of a star .",
    "next , we have searched for the typical optical spectral features seen in x - ray binaries in our observed spectrum . while  is clearly visible in absorption ,  and",
    "are only marginally detected , and he ii  ( 4686  ) is not detected at all .",

    "other prominent spectral features identified in the spectrum are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig_optspec ] .",
    "the fact that the ca i ( 4226   ) line is significantly stronger than the h@xmath11 and the h@xmath12 lines further shows that the star is of a later type than g5 .",
    "based on a more precise comparison with stellar spectra from the library by @xcite we have identified the source to be a star of spectral type g9 v.    the intrinsic color @xmath13 of a g9 v star is 0.81 @xcite and from _ grond _ the observed color is @xmath14=1.66 , resulting in @xmath15 . we thus obtain a visual extinction of @xmath16@xmath17 , considering 0.1  mag error in each of the two optical magnitudes .",
    "this @xmath16value corresponds to a neutral hydrogen column density ( @xmath18 ) of @xmath19  @xmath20 ( using the empirical formula of @xcite ) , which is consistent with the _ chandra _ x - ray data analysis best - fit value @xmath21",

    "here we explore the nature of the compact x - ray source . since the ir / optical counterpart of  is a g9 v star ,",
    "this source is not a protostar or a pulsar wind nebula or a symbiotic star , and is either a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) or a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) .",
    "note that @xcite excluded the plausible agn identification of the source based on the observed low @xmath18 value .    for a roche lobe filling main - sequence g9 v star ,",
    "the orbital period of the system is @xmath25 hrs ( using equation 3.45 of @xcite ) . for the estimated @xmath18 ,",
    "an unabsorbed flux of 5.31@xmath710@xmath26 erg @xmath20 s@xmath27 in 0.310.0 kev range implies a low x - ray luminosity of the point source ( @xmath28 erg s@xmath27 ; assuming isotropic emission ) .",
    "in contrast the luminosity of the jet is only 3.9@xmath710@xmath29erg  s@xmath27 .",
    "we note that the expected x - ray emission of a g9 star is soft and of the order of 10@xmath29erg  s@xmath27 .",
    "since the expected eddington luminosity of an lmxb is @xmath30 erg s@xmath27 ,  should have been in an extreme quiescent state during the observation , if this source is an lmxb .",
    "even if this source is a cv , its low luminosity indicates a quiescent level . in this state ,",
    "the optical and ir emission from the star can be much more than x - ray emission due to accretion : this is consistent with the results shown in the fig.4 of @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the signatures of accretion ( e.g. , broadened balmer lines & he ii  4686  , all in emission ) may not be discernible in the optical spectrum , which is consistent with the observation .",
    "the compact star of  can thus be a bh or an ns or a wd .",
    "although @xcite did not detect a soft thermal x - ray spectral component from the point source , which is a typical signature of quiescent ns lmxbs @xcite , such a thermal component can not be completely ruled out based on the available _ chandra _ data .",
    "the estimated upper limit of the flux of the thermal component is about 50% of the total flux .",
    "fitting the jet x - ray spectrum with a thermal bremsstrahlung model gives an unphysically high best - fit temperature ( @xmath31 kev ) .",
    "therefore , assuming a synchrotron origin of the jet , we follow @xcite and @xcite to estimate the minimum energy associated with . the jet length of @xmath32and a width of @xmath33 , roughly give a volume of @xmath34@xmath35 , and hence a minimum jet energy @xmath36erg .",
    "this minimum energy condition is achieved when there is an equipartition of energy in particles and the magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding magnetic field is @xmath37 = 28.4  @xmath38 g and the lorentz factor @xmath11 of the energetic electrons which emit the synchrotron radiation is 1.6@xmath39 .",
    "note that this is not the lorentz factor corresponding to the bulk motion of the material in the jet .",
    "an important question is whether the resolved x - ray jet was  fossil \" or it originated from quiescent activities . in order to find out ,",
    "we assume that the intensity difference between the approaching jet ( observed ) and a plausible receding jet ( not detected ) is solely because of doppler boosting and deboosting . unlike many pulsars the speeds of binary systems are known to be small , the only two exceptions being xtej1118 + 480 and groj1655 - 40 @xcite .",
    "hence one of the jets of should not be destroyed by the collision with ism ( as might have happened for the geminga pulsar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and our assumption of the intensity difference arising only due to doppler boosting and deboosting is reasonable . with this assumption ,",
    "the photon flux ratio of the approaching jet to the receding jet is given by @xmath40^{2+\\gamma}$ ] , where @xmath41 bulk speed of jet in the unit of the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath42 angle between the approaching jet s direction and the observer s direction , and @xmath43 is the photon index for a spectral fitting with a powerlaw .",
    "since the receding jet was not detected @xcite , we consider the maximum possible limit of @xmath44 , which is 1 .",
    "this implies that the upper and lower limits of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are 1 and @xmath47 respectively . in order to calculate the opposite limits",
    ", we use the @xmath48 upper limits of @xmath43 ( @xmath49 ) and the receding jet photon counts ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this gives a lower limit of @xmath51 , implying @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the nearest detected part of the jet was @xmath545 away from the point source during the 4th september 2001 _ chandra _ observation .",
    "hence , for @xmath55 ( which has 98% probability of occurrence assuming @xmath46 could have any random value in @xmath56 ) , and the measured source distance ( @xmath57 pc ) , this nearest detected part was ejected less than 3.6 years before september 2001 .",
    "definitely did not become bright ( non - quiescent ) after january 1998 , because , otherwise the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ )  all sky monitor \" and _ rxte _  proportional counter array \" galactic bulge scan would have detected it .",
    "the x - ray jet of this source was most likely launched by the quiescent activities .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the jet power to the ( quiescent ) accretion power is @xmath58 for  in the @xmath59 kev spectral range ( assuming isotropic emission ) , which is within the same order of magnitude of the typical ratio ( @xmath60 ) for a range of astrophysical objects @xcite .",
    "we have identified the optical / ir counterpart of the x - ray source  as a g9-v star and determined the distance to the source to be 334@xmath060pc .",
    "based on the comparable values of hydrogen column densities measured independently toward the optical / ir source and the x - ray source , we conclude that these two most likely form a binary . barring the two symbiotic stars rh cygni and r aquarii no other binary system with resolved x - ray jet has been observed at such short distances from us . the currently available x - ray data does not allow us to determine the nature of the compact object . in the event of  being an bh lmxb , it would the nearest known bh .",
    "the low x - ray luminosity of the point source , 7.1@xmath61ergs@xmath27 , suggests that the jet is most likely launched during quiescent activity .",
    "further , the low luminosity of the jet , @xmath62 erg s@xmath27 , implies that such jets could be significantly more ubiquitous than are currently known to be , since being located at large distances they are not likely to be detected easily .",
