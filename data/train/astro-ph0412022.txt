    "cmb anisotropies have been used widely to put constraints on cosmological parameters ( cp hereafter ) during the last ten years . until recently , the inhomogeneous set of observations and systematic effects have lead to limited constraints on some parameters ( or combinations of parameters ) .",
    "most of these limitations seem to disappear with the new wmap data which encompass a large sky coverage ( full sky ) and large scale range ( from arc minute to 180 degrees , or in fourier modes , from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , some degeneracies are intrinsic to cmb physics and can not be broken even with a perfect experiment ( when considering temperature anisotropies only ) .",
    "i focus in this work on the degeneracy between initial conditions and late time cosmology and in particular between the shape of the initial power spectrum and the matter content of the universe .",
    "the shape of the initial power spectrum ( ips hereafter ) is not known a priori and is often assumed to be a power law caracterised by an amplitude @xmath2 and an index @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the case @xmath5 is referred as harrison ",
    "zeldovitch spectrum .",
    "if such assumption is made ( in addition to the flatness , trivial topology of the universe and unicity of adiabatic initial modes ) , one can retrieve with good accuracy most of the cosmological parameters ( see spergel et al .",
    "2003 and fig .  1 ( right ) ) .",
    "one can also find that a unique amplitude for all scale is a bit simple and parametrize the ips by different amplitudes by intervalles in inverse scale ( @xmath6 ) . following the different works",
    ", one finds that the best shape ( as needed to fit the wmap cmb angular power spectrum ) is in agreement with a power law ( briddle et al .",
    "2003 ) or present a bent at a particular scale ( see mukherjee et al .",
    "2003 and figure 1 ) around @xmath7 .",
    "a second parametrization considered is the broken initial power spectrum .",
    "the idea is to split the spectrum in two parts , two power laws having independent indexes caracterising large and small scales .",
    "blanchard et al . ( 2003 ) have shown that in this situation wmap angular power spectrum ( in temperature and cross temperature polarization cases ) , large scale surveys ( 2df , apm , pscz ) and lyman alpha inferred power spectra are fully in agreement with an einstein de sitter model . figure 2 shows that even planck will be unable to make the difference between a @xmath8-cdm power law cosmology and a @xmath9 model with a broken power spectrum .     power law angular spectrum and @xmath9 model over - plotted on wmap data and their difference compared to planck estimated error bars , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]   power law angular spectrum and @xmath9 model over - plotted on wmap data and their difference compared to planck estimated error bars , title=\"fig:\",width=170,height=170 ]      having such good datasets as wmap allows one to probe the initial condition of cosmic scenarios .",
    "the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies is a convolution of `` late time cosmology '' effects ( transfer function , @xmath10 ) with initial conditions ( ips of fluctuations , @xmath11 ): @xmath12 , where the last term is in matrix notation and represents a numerical approximation to the integral . generally speaking , it is not possible to invert the matrix @xmath13 to solve for the power spectrum , because each @xmath14 embraces information about a limited range in @xmath15-space .",
    "however the inversion is feasible under some assumptions .",
    "basically the lack of information can be remedied by the introduction of priors , such as for example the requirement of a certain degree of smoothness in the solution .",
    "tocchini valentini , douspis and silk ( 2004 ) have presented a new method reaching this goal , with the advantage of knowing the error bars on the reconstructed ips .",
    "other methods have been proposed in the same spirit ( shafieloo et al .",
    "2004 ; kogo et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "figure 3 ( left ) shows the reconstructed power spectrum from wmap individual @xmath14 s when `` concordance '' late time cosmological parameters are assumed .",
    "the horizontal black line represent the best fitting power law ips found in spergel et al .",
    "the first remark is perhaps that the reconstructed ips is not far from a power law .",
    "nevertheless , deviations occur and are needed in order to fit features seen in the angular power spectrum and responsible for the `` bad '' goodness of fit of a power law spectrum .",
    "the reconstructed ips allows one to fit the wmap @xmath14 s in improving by 44 the log - likelihood ( @xmath16 ) compared to the power law @xmath8-cdm .",
    "such spectrum let some imprints in the angular power spectrum but also in the matter power spectrum .",
    "recent surveys probing large scales are then able to test such deviations .",
    "figure 3 ( right ) shows the comparison between the ips found in fig .",
    "3 ( left ) evolved to now , and the matter power spectrum observed by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "more than being compatible , here again , the reconstructed ips allows to improve the goodness of fit , by fitting nicely the deviations seen in sdss data .         if such deviations ( in the angular and matter ps ) remain in the future ( at this level ) , it will be hard firstly to detect them in the ips ( if they are not systematics effects ) and then to explain such behavior ( especially if they are not coherent ; see martin & ringeval ( 2004 ) for coherent oscillations in the ips ) .",
    "furthermore , if the `` concordance '' cosmological parameter prior is not set , one is able to find the `` best '' ips fitting the data for almost any kind of cosmological parameters given the strong degeneracy between initial conditions and late time cosmology .",
    "figure 6 shows for example the ips reconstructed from wmap @xmath14 s by forcing @xmath17 and the cosmological parameters presented in blanchard et al .",
    "the corresponding angular spectrum gives by definition an acceptable goodness of fit ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the degeneracy between primordial cosmology , ips , and late time cosmology , cp , allows one to mimic actual ( and future ) cmb angular power spectrum observations . if the hypothesis of unique power law initial power spectrum is relaxed , the constraints from cmb ( and large scale surveys ) on cosmological parameters are weakened .",
    "such degeneracy shows then the need for other probes and combinations ( clusters of galaxy , supernovae , lensed galaxies , ... ) in order to reach precision cosmology and to set strong constraints on cosmic scenarios ."
