    "strongly correlated quantum many - body systems with topological order have been proposed as a substrate for building fault - tolerant quantum computers  @xcite . under this proposal ,",
    "logical information is stored within a subspace of a fixed number of quasi - particles ( anyons ) .",
    "computation is performed by exploiting the non - abelian statistics obeyed by these anyons under braiding . compared to more conventional implementations of quantum computers ,",
    "this offers an intrinsic resilience to noise : local perturbations can not decohere the stored information because of the non - local nature of the encoding .    at present ,",
    "perhaps the most promising candidate systems exhibiting non - abelian statistics are fractional quantum hall systems  @xcite .",
    "some amount of experimental evidence is already available in this setting  @xcite .",
    "other proposed systems include topological insulators  @xcite and lattice spin systems  @xcite whose local interactions could be enginereed artificially  @xcite .",
    "independently of the proposed physical realization , the stability of the topologically ordered phase with respect to ( local ) perturbations is of great interest for topological quantum computation .",
    "this presents a formidable theoretical challenge .",
    "possible approaches range from the study of concrete physical models ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) or bounds on the gap for general families of models  @xcite to the investigation of effective hamiltonians describing the inter - anyon interactions ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in the context of the latter ,",
    "it is natural to study paradigmatic models such as 1-dimensional anyonic chains .",
    "these are the natural counterpart of spin chains .",
    "the study of such systems has led , e.g. , to an exactly solved model called the golden chain  @xcite , and novel realizations of infinite randomness critical phases  @xcite .",
    "a peculiar aspect of anyonic systems is the structure of the hilbert space of @xmath0  anyons .",
    "in contrast to the space of @xmath0 qudits , this space does not decompose into an @xmath0-fold tensor product .",
    "instead , its dimension scales as  @xmath1 , where the quantum dimension  @xmath2 is generally not an integer . for analytical studies , it is sometimes convenient to embed this space into a larger tensor product space .",
    "however , this approach is inconvenient when using variational methods : with the most straightforward encoding , it may be unclear how to vary ( numerically ) over the subset of physical states .",
    "furthermore , this leads to a significant increase in computational complexity , particularly because locality is only approximately preserved by such an embedding . even for one - dimensional anyonic systems , these issues",
    "complicate the direct application numerical methods such as dmrg  @xcite . while such methods may presently be the most powerful and successful tools available ,",
    "these difficulties motivate the search for alternative approaches .",
    "there is another more profound reason why the nave application of numerical methods for qudits may be suboptimal : local anyonic operators preserve the total topological charge in their support .",
    "since a realisitic hamiltonian consists of locally acting terms , topological charge conservation severly constrains the action of the hamiltonian both at the local level as well as on larger scales .",
    "incorporating this fact into the method of study should therefore be highly beneficial . with a qudit embedding ,",
    "the meaning of this constraint is obscured and may be hard to make use of .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a variational method for anyonic systems which avoids using unphysical additional states and optimally exploits the special structure of the hilbert space .",
    "this is motivated in part by the goal of facilitating numerical studies .",
    "perhaps more importantly , variational families of ansatz states can provide significant insight into the nature of quantum correlations in a given system . even in this regard ,",
    "a qudit embedding of anyons is generally undesirable , as a physically motivated ansatz for qudit systems may lose its significance when applied directly to the anyonic setting .",
    "our scheme is inspired by renormalization group studies of anyonic chains  @xcite , composite anyon distillation  @xcite and the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera )  @xcite for ( non - anyonic ) spin chains .",
    "in fact , it can be understood as the natural anyonic counterpart of the latter and shares many of its properties .",
    "in particular , it can be seen as a renormalization group scheme and is thus especially suited for describing scale - invariant systems .",
    "the scheme allows  in principle  to extract , e.g. , critical exponents when considering fixed points of the renormalization group flow .",
    "more generally , it provides procedures for computing parameters of the corresponding conformal field theory ( cft ) in the continuum limit . while such procedures are also available for other variational methods ( e.g. , matrix product states  @xcite , by transfer matrix methods ) , they are particularly natural in the present context due to the scale - invariant form of the ansatz .",
    "we formulate our ansatz for one - dimensional ( periodic ) chains of anyons .",
    "this allows us to numerically test its validity for the golden chain  @xcite and its relatives  @xcite . ultimately , though , it is desirable to find methods for two - dimensional systems .",
    "our work makes some progress towards this goal : the non - anyonic mera extends naturally to two dimensions and this is also the case for its anyonic counterpart . in the appendix",
    ", we briefly comment on such generalizations .",
    "entanglement renormalization , while originally defined for qudit systems , has been extended to free bosons  @xcite and interacting fermions  @xcite .",
    "anyonic statistics are peculiar to two dimensions , encompassing both fermions and bosons ( which are abelian ) in addition to interesting non - abelian generalizations .",
    "our ansatz applies to all such models , but its use is especially suggestive in the non - abelian case .",
    "this is due to the special form of the hilbert space mentioned earlier .",
    "interestingly , the exact details of the exchange statistics play essentially no role in the definition of the ansatz , though they become important when evaluating expectation values of local operators in the case of e.g. , two - dimensional arrangements of anyons .    in a wider context",
    ", entanglement renormalization is a special instance of the class of tensor network states , which also includes e.g. , mps  @xcite , peps  @xcite as well as the closely related terg - states  @xcite .",
    "these have wide applicability beyond qudit systems .",
    "in particular , a general framework for fermions has been developed  @xcite .",
    "our focus is on entanglement renormalization because of its unique operational interpretation , as well as the possibility of efficiently computing expectation values without approximations , even in two dimensions ( in contrast to e.g. , peps  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , anyonic entanglement renormalization is conceptually related to previous analytical studies for anyonic chains  @xcite .",
    "however , our work suggests that anyonic generalizations of other tensor network states should also be possible along similar lines , though further work may be needed to evaluate their descriptive power .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : mera ]",
    ", we review the formulation of the mera for spin chains . in section  [",
    "sec : anyonicformalism ] , we give some background on anyonic systems and their description in terms of fusion diagrams .",
    "we then present the anyonic entanglement renormalization ansatz in section  [ sec : anyonicmera ] and show how to efficiently evaluate expectation values of local observables and correlation functions .",
    "we also discuss an operational interpretation in the context of composite anyon distillation . in section  [ sec : goldenchain ] , we apply the ansatz to the golden chain and identify a renormalization group fixed point .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to motivate our ansatz , we recapitulate the definition of the mera for 1d  qudit chains and that of related tensor network states  @xcite . for more details , we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the assumption underlying this ansatz is that certain local degrees of freedom are insignificant for the long - range character of the target state .",
    "the mera is a quantum circuit which completely decouples and discards these degrees of freedom using local unitaries .",
    "this procedure is subsequently repeated for the resulting coarse - grained description of the state . as a variational family of states ,",
    "the mera consists of those states which are turned into ( @xmath0-fold ) product states by such quantum circuits .",
    "it is convenient to use the diagrammatic formalism of tensor networks to describe the unitaries and the local isometries constituting a mera ( the latter correspond to the elimination of local degrees of freedom , but the division into `` disentangling '' unitaries and isometries is often arbitrary ) . in this formalism , the identity on  @xmath3 is represented by a single directed edge , and operators @xmath4 are represented by shaded boxes with @xmath5  ingoing and @xmath6  outgoing ( ordered ) edges .",
    "labels on the edges from  @xmath7 correspond to the elements of a fixed orthonormal basis of  @xmath3 .",
    "products of operators are taken by connecting outgoing with ingoing edges , and summing over labels of edges with no free ends .",
    "the trace of an operator on  @xmath8 is taken by connecting each outgoing strand with the corresponding ingoing strand , and then contracting the tensor network ( i.e. , summing over all edge labelings ) .",
    "partial traces are computed analogously by connecting up subsets of edges .",
    "tensor products are obtained by placing diagrams next to each other .",
    "consider a system of @xmath0  qudits arranged on a line with periodic boundary condtions .",
    "for any tensor network as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mera ] , one obtains a variational family of states @xmath13 parametrized by the isometries @xmath14 and the state  @xmath15 at the top of the structure .",
    "this is the mera ansatz .",
    "[ fig : mera ] represents a map @xmath16 which can be understood as the bra  @xmath17 of the represented state .",
    "the fact that the recipe specifies  @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 is a matter of preference , but the chosen convention has a natural operational interpretation : one may think of fig .",
    "[ fig : mera ] as a renormalization prescription by decomposing the tensor network along different horizontal cuts  @xmath19 .",
    "the strips @xmath20 represent coarse - graining maps which reduce the number of degrees of freedom at each level .       for concreteness , we first consider the example of the two - leg ladder model discussed in  @xcite , closely following that presentation .",
    "this is a system of two chains of @xmath6  anyons each placed next to each other as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : twochainladder ] along a non - trivial cycle on the torus .",
    "the figure also indicates two - anyon nearest neighbor interactions , which are e.g. , projections onto trivial charge as in the golden chain .",
    "the hilbert space of this system is @xmath21 with @xmath22 , as this space depends only on the topology of the surface ( an @xmath23-punctured torus ) and the boundary labels ( all equal to  @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , the basis   is now ambiguous and we must choose a linear ordering of the anyons . a convenient choice of an ordering is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ladderlabeling ] .    given this ordering , some of the nearest - neighbor terms in the hamiltonian now act on non - neighboring pairs @xmath25  of strands in the diagrammatic representation . to make sense of such terms",
    ", it is necessary to introduce an additional basis change corresponding to a transposition @xmath26 .",
    "physically , such basis changes correspond to movements of the anyons , and this is where the ( non - abelian ) braid group statistics appears : pairs of neighboring anyons may be exchanged in either clockwise or anticlockwise fashion .",
    "thus there are two inequivalent ways of transposing neighboring pairs .",
    "it is natural to define the hamiltonian as the result of transposing , applying the charge projection , and undoing the transposition , averaged over either version of exchanging .    in the diagrammatic formalism",
    ", clockwise- and anticlockwise exchanges of neighboring anyons are represented by over- and undercrossings , respectively .",
    "the following computational rules involving the @xmath27-matrix of the modular category are then added to the isotopy - invariant calculus : @xmath28 with  - , these rules imply that over- and undercrossings may be resolved according to @xmath29 where the sums are restricted to fusion - compatible labels  @xmath30 .",
    ".   gives the matrix elements of the linear operators @xmath31 corresponding to the two types of exchanges .",
    "they are unitary if @xmath32 .    given this definition , we can write down the interaction corresponding to preferred trivial charge of a ` horizontal ' pair @xmath33 of neighboring anyons on the bottom chain in fig .  [ f : twochainladder ] as follows : @xmath34 these are @xmath35-anyon operators acting on the anyons indexed  @xmath36 .",
    "analogous expressions apply to pairs on the upper chain .",
    "the two - chain ladder is one of the simplest examples where transpositions need to be used to define physically interesting hamiltonians . in a more generally arrangment of anyons , such as a regular @xmath37-lattice",
    ", the same procedure applies .",
    "depending the chosen standard ordering , however , more transpositions may be required to apply a local operator to a subset of anyons .",
    "for example , a projection onto trivial charge of two anyons may take the form @xmath38 where we sum over particles for undirected edges .",
    "the fact that   is a multi - anyon non - local operator now appears to be an obstacle to the use of the anyonic entanglement renormalization ansatz .",
    "but the special structure of   allows to efficiently evaluate its expectation value for suitable mera structures in spite of this .",
    "this is because crossings can be pushed past isometries to higher levels using the fact that @xmath39 ( and similarly for undercrossings ) , and be absorbed into the isometries / unitaries by applying the linear maps   to their inputs and outputs , respectively .",
    "this eventually reduces the evaluation to the expectation value of a local operator for a related anyonic mera - state .",
    "the efficiency of this procedure depends on the number of crossings that need to be resolved , and therefore on a judicious choice of orderings .",
    "this feature is identical to fermionic tensor networks / meras , where it is necessary to keep track of the number of swaps ."
