    "the hilbert space spanned by the basis vectors @xmath56 is introduced .",
    "then we upgrade the hybrid state , hamiltonian , and transition generators into composite operators on the big hilbert space : @xmath57 now we consider the following lindblad me : @xmath58+\\sum_\\alpha\\left[{\\widehat l}_\\alpha{\\widehat\\rho}{\\widehat l}_\\alpha{^\\dagger}-{{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\{{\\widehat l}_\\alpha{^\\dagger}{\\widehat l}_\\alpha,{\\widehat\\rho}\\}\\right]\\;.\\ ] ] it is consistent , as we know . by construction , it preserves the block diagonality ( [ hdup ] ) of @xmath59 .",
    "so , if we multiply both sides by @xmath60 and take the partial trace on both sides , we get exactly the hybrid me ( [ hme ] ) .",
    "therefore the consistency of the latter is guaranteed by the lindblad me ( [ qmebig ] ) .",

    "we are looking for the dynamics of @xmath62 .",
    "the hybrid me that evolves @xmath62 should contain a coupling between @xmath45 and @xmath61 .",

    "our naive hybrid me is not correct .",
    "nonetheless , we can find the correct one . invoking the method of section [ derivation ] , we postulate the lindblad me ( [ qmebig ] ) on the big hilbert space , with a carefully choice of a single lindblad operator : @xmath66 substitute this into ( [ qmebig ] ) , multiply both sides by @xmath67 and take partial trace on both sides",

    "which cure the defect of the naive me ( [ hmemonnaive ] ) . the crucial relationship ( [ xq ] ) between the classical variable @xmath61 and the monitored position @xmath45 survives whereas a diffusive noise is superposed on the measured signal @xmath61 as well as on the momentum of the particle .",
    "observe the exact reciprocal trade between the signal noise and momentum diffusion ( i.e. : position decoherence ) .",
    "let s integrate both sides over @xmath61 .",
    "we find that the reduced quantum state @xmath2 obeys the simple lindblad me ( [ decme ] ) with @xmath69 .",
    "a more complex derivative of the hybrid me of monitoring is the following non - autonomous fokker - planck equation for the reduced classical density : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the conditional expectation value of @xmath45 .",
    "this equation expresses the diffusive noise superposed on the measured signal @xmath61 , at diffusion coefficient @xmath41 .",
    "the hybrid me ( [ hmemon ] ) is equivalent with the standard theory of quantum monitoring @xcite which prescribes two coupled ito stochastic differential equations for the conditional state @xmath72 and the measured signal @xmath61 , respectively , instead of the hybrid me for @xmath62 .",
    "the proof of equivalence of the two ito equations with the hybrid me is straightforward , will be shown elsewhere .",
    "we gave a short introduction into the concept of hybrid systems .",
    "we emphasized that quantum measurement has a natural hybrid formalism .",
    "a novel general structure of hybrid me has been proposed , to unify the pauli and lindblad structures .",
    "an application to quantum continuous measurement ( monitoring ) has been shown .",
    "ad hoc hybrid theories are often falling short .",
    "certain ad hoc mes violate the positivity of the hybrid density .",

    "certain ad hoc hybrid theories do nt pass the `` free will test '' @xcite .",
