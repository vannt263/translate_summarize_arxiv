    "in the current paradigm for structure formation , the cold dark matter model @xcite , galaxy mergers play an important role in galaxy formation and evolution . galaxy mergers drive gas towards central starbursts ( e.g.  @xcite ) and supermassive black holes ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and transform galactic morphology ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "many parameters , like the gas fraction and morphology of the merging galaxies , as well as their relative orbits and orientations , affect the properties of the merger remnant .",
    "one of the most important factors is the mass ratio of the merging galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy mergers of all mass ratios are frequent in a universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but special importance is given to major mergers , usually considered as those with mass ratios less than @xmath2 .",
    "these are thought to play a significant role in the buildup of the red sequence @xcite by transforming blue star - forming late type galaxies into red passive early type galaxies .",
    "many observational studies have been carried out in recent years to investigate the fraction of galaxies that show signs of major merger activity as a function of mass , luminosity and redshift .",
    "observationally , only merger fractions can be obtained , and in order to transform them into merger rates , which can be directly compared with theoretical models , the time scale of the observed events must be estimated ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "two principal approaches are used to observe galaxy merger fractions .",
    "one is pair counting ( e.g.  @xcite ) , i.e.  identifying galaxies separated from one another by less that typically @xmath3 .",
    "this method probes the pre - merger stage and is therefore a `` progenitor galaxy '' merger fraction @xcite .",
    "the second approach is identification of mergers through morphological signatures such as asymmetry and tidal tails ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this method aims at identifying mergers in their relatively late stages , and is therefore a `` descendant galaxy '' merger fraction . for each of the principal approaches different authors use different methods , as well as different selection criteria , which create systematic effects that are not easily comparable .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic uncertainties of each method , and the effect of cosmic variance ( e.g.  @xcite ) contribute further to the large scatter between the obtained results .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have noticed that the merger fractions obtained with the two principal methods should be carefully defined , and can not be directly compared to each other , as they are actually different quantities . both authors proposed ( different ) simple conversions between the two quantities . nevertheless , both disregarded the fact that the mass difference between the progenitors and the descendant is up to a factor of @xmath4 ( in equal - mass binary mergers )",
    ". that may result in very large differences in the number densities of progenitors and of descendants . since the measured merger _ fraction _",
    "implicitly includes the information of the _ number _ of objects , different number densities are implicitly included in the merger rate or merger fraction per progenitor galaxy versus per descendant galaxy .",
    "@xcite and @xcite realised this , and have taken the different number densities into account when comparing merger fractions obtained with different methods .",
    "we show in this paper that the different definitions of the merger rate , per descendant or per progenitor halo , lead to significantly different results , particularly for major mergers , high redshift mergers , and high mass mergers .",
    "galaxy mergers follow their dark matter halo mergers , but the connection between the two is not straightforward .",
    "when two dark matter halos merge , the orbital angular momentum is transferred into internal degrees of freedom , while the more concentrated galaxies are at first not much affected .",
    "the galaxies lose relative angular momentum due to dynamical friction , and they start merging as well when they are more tightly bound @xcite .",
    "all of the baryonic physics involved in galaxy mergers makes it difficult theoretically to quantify the galaxy merger rate reliably ( p.  f.  hopkins et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "nevertheless , a first step towards quantifying the galaxy merger rate would be to understand the dark matter halo merger rate , which can be studied more robustly .",
    "@xcite have estimated the halo merger rate based on the extended press - schechter ( eps ) model @xcite . @xcite and @xcite have recently constructed eps - based approximations that are self - consistent , and @xcite have done so for the ellipsoidal collapse model .",
    "all these models differ by factors of a few tenths up to a few .",
    "n - body simulations have only recently been used to study the halo merger rate with a large dynamical range ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter fm08 ) .",
    "fm08 have investigated this problem based on the large millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "they have found that the dark matter halo merger rate has an almost universal form that can be separated into its dependencies on mass ratio , descendant mass and redshift . nevertheless , the analysis of n - body simulations is also subject to uncertainties , in particular in identifying halos .",
    "fm08 present 3 ways to analyse the simulation , which differ from one another by @xmath5 , and by a more significant amount compared to the @xcite analytical approximation .",
    "all of these investigations have quantified the halo merger rate per _ descendant _ halo .",
    "recent work has also used n - body simulations to study mergers of subhalos @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extract the dark matter halo merger rate from the millennium simulation using a new method for identifying halos and mergers , as well as a new definition of the merger rate . in ",
    "[ s : millennium ] we review the millennium simulation and its post - processing . in  [ s : new_trees ] we describe how we create merger trees that are free of artificial effects not considered previously . in  [ s : rates ] we define the merger rate per descendant halo , as well as the merger rate per progenitor halo , which is related to observed galaxy merger fractions when they are measured via pair counting . in ",

    "the millennium simulation is a cosmological n - body simulation following @xmath6 dark matter particles , each of mass @xmath7 , in a box of @xmath8 on a side , with 64 generated output times ( `` snapshots '' ) from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the cosmology is set to with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which we will adopt throughout this paper .    in the millennium simulation",
    "there are two levels of structure identification .",
    "first , the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm ( @xcite ; with a linking length @xmath17 of the mean particle separation ) creates a catalogue of fof groups in every snapshot . in the limit of a large number of particles ,",
    "fof groups enclose the particles within isodensity contours of @xmath18 times the mean matter density @xcite , and their mean densities correspond approximately to the overdensities of virialised halos expected from the spherical collapse model @xcite .",
    "thus , fof groups are considered to represent dark matter halos .",
    "however , substructure as traced by local density maxima are not distinguishable within the fof groups . for this purpose ,",
    "the algorithm subfind @xcite identifies substructures in each fof group , by finding gravitationally self - bound groups of particles around maxima in their smoothed density field .",
    "thus , each fof group contains at least one subhalo , and the subhalo with the `` most massive history '' is chosen to be the _ main _",
    "subhalo @xcite .",
    "the millennium merger trees are constructed from the subhalos by finding a single descendant for each subhalo at the following snapshot .",
    "the fof groups themselves play no role in constructing the merger trees .",
    "nevertheless , if the halo merger rate is to be studied , then new merger trees , in which each node is a halo rather than a subhalo , must be built .",
    "we build new halo - based , that is fof group - based , merger trees by defining one descendant for each fof group .",
    "the main subhalo in each fof group is identified and followed to its subhalo descendant using the original subhalo trees .",
    "then , the fof group to which that subhalo descendant belongs is defined as the fof group descendant of the fof group in question .    [",
    "f : splitting_motivation ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to investigate the sensitivity of our results to the time resolution of the snapshots in the simulation , we have performed the following test . for any progenitor snapshot @xmath19",
    ", we have extracted the merger rate skipping the two subsequent snapshots , as though the next available snapshot was only @xmath20 . at low redshift",
    "we find a negligible change in the results . at increasing redshift , @xmath21 increases ,",
    "so when @xmath4 snapshots are skipped , there occurs a non - negligible effect of averaging the redshift dependence of the merger rate .",
    "this is why at @xmath22 a decrease of up to @xmath1 can be seen for this `` skip @xmath4 '' method , a difference that is consistent with being just the result of averaging the redshift dependence .",
    "this @xmath21-convergence is comparable to the one found by fm08 .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ f : rates_x ] and table [ t : fits ] , the shape of @xmath23 changes with mass and redshift , so that no global values for the fitting parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 & @xmath27 can be obtained .",
    "this reflects deviation from self similarity , in the sense that halos of different masses and at different redshifts have different weights for merging with halos of different mass ratios . at a given redshift ( figure [ f : rate_vs_x_low_z ] and figure [",
    "f : rate_vs_x_high_z ] ) , more massive halos have slightly more minor mergers ( @xmath28 , consistently with fm08 ) while they are being accreted onto larger halos ( @xmath29 ) at a much lower rate than less massive halos .",
    "similarly , for a given halo mass ( figure [ f : rate_vs_x_const_mass ] ) , at high redshift the minor merger rate ( per unit time ) is higher , while the rate of being accreted onto bigger halos is lower .      for a quantitative comparison between similar masses at different redshifts or different masses at fixed redshifts",
    ", a specific value or range in @xmath30 must be chosen .",
    "we investigate the dependence on mass and redshift of the possibly most interesting range : @xmath31 , i.e.  the major merger rate : @xmath32 note that , following the discussion in ",
    "[ s : rates ] , in cases where integrating over the range @xmath31 counts the same merger twice , also both halos are counted in @xmath33 .",
    "in other words , each merger always contributes exactly one count to the merger rate _ per halo",

    "[ f : mm_rate ]    [ f : mm_rate_comp ]    figure [ f : rate_vs_m_low_z ] shows the dependence of @xmath34 on mass at @xmath35 . at @xmath36 the major merger rate increases with increasing mass , and a relation of the form @xmath37 holds , as the solid green line in figure [ f : rate_vs_m_low_z ] shows .",
    "however , for higher masses the major merger rate _ decreases _ with increasing mass , because the exponential cut - off of @xmath38 at small @xmath30 affects even the range @xmath39 . at each redshift the critical mass above which equation ( [ e : mass_dependence ] )",
    "no longer holds is different . at high redshift",
    "there are less massive halos , so the exponential cut - off occurs at @xmath40 already for lower masses , compared with low redshift .",
    "we find that equation ( [ e : mass_dependence ] ) is valid for @xmath41    similarly , for a given mass @xmath42 , at low enough redshifts the major merger rate increases with increasing redshift , as shown in figure [ f : rate_vs_z_const_mass ] .",
    "the relation is of the form @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "but since @xmath45 decreases with increasing redshift , there is a redshift above which @xmath46 . at that redshift",
    "the major merger rate begins to be affected by the exponential cut - off , and the power law approximation breaks down .",
    "the major merger rate starts _ decreasing _ with increasing redshift only at much higher redshifts ( e.g.  while @xmath47 , the major merger rate of @xmath48 halos starts decreasing with increasing redshift only at @xmath49 ) .",
    "we note that the regime that is affected by the cut - off exists for the merger rate per progenitor halo that we present in this section . it does not appear in the merger rate per descendant halo , as will be shown in  [ s : rates_desc ] and  [ s : comparison_prog_desc ] .    as long as equation ( [ e : critical_mass ] ) holds , we find the following fitting function for the major merger rate as a function of mass and redshift : @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it is accurate to within @xmath55 , an inaccuracy that is included in the errors quoted for the fitting parameters . because of the inability to properly split halos in the very last snapshots of the simulation at @xmath56 ( as explained in ",
    "[ s : new_trees ] ) we do not include this range in our fitting .",
    "an illustration of the regime where equation ( [ e : critical_mass ] ) does not hold is shown in figure [ f : rate_vs_x_high_z ] and figure [ f : rate_vs_m_high_z ] . since @xmath57 ,",
    "all the mass ranges we can probe at this redshift are in the regime where equation ( [ e : critical_mass ] ) does nt hold . in figure",
    "[ f : rate_vs_x_high_z ] it is shown that at @xmath22 the exponential cut - off occurs at much larger @xmath30 ( compared with figure [ f : rate_vs_x_low_z ] ) , so that also the major and minor merger regimes are affected .",
    "this means that the merger rate is _ lower _ for _ more _ massive halos even at @xmath58 , as opposed to low redshift , where this is true only for @xmath59 . the major merger rate , explicitly as a function of mass , is shown in figure [ f : rate_vs_m_high_z ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the major merger rate per unit redshift , @xmath60 is approximately constant with redshift for the range that is not affected by the exponential cut - off , since @xmath61 approximately cancels out the redshift dependence in equation ( [ e : major_merger_rate_fit ] ) . at redshifts higher than the break redshift , the major merger rate per unit redshift decreases steeply with increasing redshift .",
    "the bimodal fit : @xmath62 describes the major merger rate per unit redshift for @xmath63 halos as a function of redshift .",
    "it can be applied for different masses using equation ( [ e : major_merger_rate_fit ] ) to scale with mass , and equation ( [ e : critical_mass ] ) to find the `` break '' redshift .",
    "if the mass dependence of the major merger rate , which is weak , is neglected , equation ( [ e : major_merger_rate_fit ] ) can be integrated between @xmath64 and @xmath65 to achieve the average number of major mergers throughout the formation history of halos .",
    "if a population of halos of mass @xmath42 is chosen at redshift @xmath64 where @xmath66 , then for @xmath67 the major merger rate per unit redshift is roughly constant with redshift .",
    "therefore the very simple linear relation for the average number of major mergers halos of mass @xmath42 at redshift @xmath64 will undergo until redshift @xmath68 is @xmath69 while the number of major mergers individual halos undergo is of course distributed around this average .",
    "we find that the merger rate per descendant halo can be fit much better with a global fitting formula , compared with the rate per progenitor halo .",
    "we adopt the fitting form of fm08 ( albeit keeping our mass ratio variable @xmath70 ) , and give different best - fitting parameters that express our different treatment of fragmentations (  [ s : new_trees ] ) and different mass definition (  [ s : mass_def ] ) : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which we estimate using the approximation provided by @xcite .",
    "our best - fitting parameters are : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "note that with the mass ratio definition used by fm08 our parameters correspond , in their notation , to : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath78 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "a detailed comparison with the results of fm08 is presented in ",
    "[ s : comparison_fm08 ] .",
    "we find this formula to fit the merger rate per descendant halo per unit redshift with deviations of up to @xmath1 for all the mass range probed by the millennium simulation at redshifts @xmath83 .",
    "one systematic exception is at @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where the fitting formula tends to overestimate the merger rate by up to @xmath0 . at @xmath86 the redshift dependence as well as",
    "the mass dependence become stronger , and we do not make an attempt to fit that regime .    also the merger rate per descendant halo can be integrated across cosmic times ( neglecting its mass dependence ) to obtain the mean number of major mergers that halos of mass @xmath42 at redshift @xmath68 have undergone since redshift @xmath64 . if we approximate @xmath87 as @xmath88 at @xmath89 and @xmath90 at @xmath91 ( an approximation that holds with deviations @xmath92 ) then we obtain @xmath93      for mergers of @xmath94 at high mass / redshift the different definition of the merger rate , i.e.  per progenitor halo versus per descendant halo (  [ s : rates ] ) , is an important issue .",
    "where equation ( [ e : critical_mass ] ) is no longer satisfied , the functional behaviour of the two is different : defining the merger rate per progenitor halo , the exponential cut - off of the merger rate enters into the @xmath58 range , whereas defining it per descendant halo , the function increases all the way to @xmath95 , beyond which @xmath30 is no longer defined .",
    "this difference is caused by attributing major mergers ( e.g.  between identical halos of mass @xmath42 ) to their approximate sum of masses . the same number of mergers is recorded by both methods , but there are far fewer halos with mass @xmath96 than halos with mass @xmath42 in the exponential cut - off regime .    for @xmath97 , or the minor merger regime , the difference between the two definitions is small .",
    "for example , the integrated rate of mergers with @xmath98 per progenitor halo is lower by @xmath55 at @xmath99 and @xmath100 than the same rate per descendant halo .",
    "we further consider the major merger rate , i.e.  the merger rate integrated over @xmath31 ( or @xmath101 for the merger rate per descendant halo ) .",
    "figure [ f : mm_rate_comp ] shows the merger rate per descendant halo , keeping our halo mass definition and treatment of halo fragmentation ( _ blue , asterisks _ ) . comparing figure [ f : mm_rate_comp ] to figure [ f : mm_rate ] illustrates that in the low mass / redshift regime where equation ( [ e : critical_mass ] ) holds , the major merger rate is only slightly affected by the merger rate definition . as described in ",
    "[ s : rates_m_z ] , above the threshold set by equation ( [ e : critical_mass ] ) , we find the mass / redshift dependencies of the merger rate per progenitor halo to break , a different behaviour than that of the merger rate per descendant halo . at high",

    "finally , only the merger rate per progenitor halo quantifies the rate of `` destruction '' events , where halos are accreted onto more massive halos , in an explicit way .",
    "this `` destruction '' merger rate , @xmath102 , is not defined by the merger rate per descendant halo alone . to obtain the merger rate with @xmath102 from the merger rate per descendant halo ,",
    "the halo mass function must be known . in appendix",
    "[ s : analytic ] we develop analytic formulae that convert merger rates per descendant halo into merger rates per progenitor halo and vice versa , and also relate the merger rate per progenitor halo at @xmath102 to that at @xmath58 . the conversion formula from the merger rate per descendant halo to the merger rate per progenitor halo",
    "is given by @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the merger rate per progenitor halo , @xmath106 is the merger rate per descendant halo , @xmath107 is the mass function defined as @xmath108 , and @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the progenitor and descendant redshifts , respectively .",
    "we verified numerically that those formulae describe the relations between the different merger rate definitions well .",

    "the difference arises because fm08 accept most temporary links between fof groups as mergers .",
    "this leads to an artificial inflation of the number of minor mergers .",

    "the merger rate per descendant halo is the natural quantity that is obtained from the eps model , and does not require explicitly the mass function of halos .",
    "fm08 found that the eps model predicts more major mergers and ( especially ) fewer minor mergers compared with the millennium simulation .",

    "the redshift dependence of the merger rate in the millennium simulation based on our method matches well that of eps ( see also @xcite ) , but the normalisation , as already mentioned , has an offset .",
    "[ f : comparison_eps ]      there is a substantial uncertainty as to how to determine the boundaries of halos in n - body simulations .",
    "sometimes the mass of halos is taken as the mass inside a sphere , within which the density equals the expected density of virialised groups in the spherical collapse model .",
    "this class of definitions is not well - suited for our purposes , because they are less reliable for halos undergoing mergers @xcite .",

    "[ s : new_trees ] ) and spurious linkage of particles to groups are inherent to the algorithm .",

    "therefore , two reasonable definitions we consider for the mass of a halo are : ( 1 ) the total mass of all the particles associated with the halo by the fof algorithm ( as in e.g.  fm08 ) , and ( 2 ) the total mass of all the particles that belong to the halo and are also gravitationally bound to any of its subhalos .    as described in ",

    "first we describe how this affects the merger rate , and then interpret this phenomenon and justify our choice of not including the unbound particles when computing the merger rate .",
    "halos at snapshot @xmath19 that are about to undergo a merger have on average higher ratios of total fof mass over bound subfind mass .",
    "we find that the total - over - bound mass ratio of a halo correlates with two quantities related to a halo s next merger : 1 ) the time before the next merger begins , relatively to the dynamical time @xmath138 , and 2 ) the mass ratio of that merger .",
    "specifically , as a halo approaches a merger with another halo of comparable or larger mass , its total - over - bound mass ratio increases with time , an effect that is stronger as the mass of the other halo is larger",

    "[ f : ratio_vs_ratio ]    since the more massive halo of the merging pair ( or group ) retains the typical value of @xmath151 , and the less massive halos have untypically large total - over - bound mass ratios , the mass ratios of mergers shift towards smaller values ( mergers become more equal - mass ) when the total mass is taken into account , compared with the choice of the bound mass as the halo mass .",
    "the effect on the merger rate is pronounced . when the halo mass is taken as the total mass",
    ", there is a deficiency of very high mass ratio mergers near the resolution limit , but since we restrict our analysis to mergers with halos of @xmath152 , this is not seen .",
    "what is seen is an enhancement of the merger rate for every @xmath153 .",
    "the merger rate using the total fof mass is larger by typically @xmath154 and up to @xmath155 than our fiducial method .",

    "when the halo mass is defined as the total fof mass , including gravitationally unbound particles , the inferred merger rate is higher by up to @xmath0 ( in a similar way for all masses at all redshifts ) .",
    "this is caused by the fact that halos that are about to merge with more massive halos have unusually high total - to - bound mass ratios . to check whether this is the only source of difference",

    "the difference , at a given overdensity , between all halos and halos about to undergo a @xmath102 merger shows that it is not possible to use the correlation with the environmental overdensity to disentangle the dependence shown in figure [ f : ratio_vs_ratio ] .",

    "[ f : mass_vs_density ]    the strong correlation of the total - over - bound mass ratio of halos with their proximity to their next merger and its mass ratio , and the fact that there is almost no additional dependence on environment , suggest that the mergers themselves are responsible for the change in the total - over - bound mass ratio .",
    "the question to be asked is whether this is a gravitational effect , which changes the bound mass even before the fof groups merge , or a numerical effect , which changes the fof group mass even before the gravitational interaction is significant . to give a fully satisfactory answer to that question ,",
    "a detailed dynamical analysis is needed , which can not be obtained with just the merger trees , and is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , figure [ f : mass_histories ] shows that it is not the bound mass that decreases before the merger , but the total mass that increases more rapidly , that causes the total - over - bound mass ratio to increase .",
    "we postulate that a significant amount of particles are added to the outskirts of the fof group during the few snapshots before the merger , but are not found to be bound to it .",

    "each curve is normalised to @xmath157 at the time of @xmath168 snapshots before the merger .",
    "it is seen that the total mass grows faster than the bound mass , which results in increased total - over - bound mass ratios as these halos approach a merger with a more massive halo . for halos",

    "the two different definitions of the merger rate , per progenitor halo and per descendant halo , have different physical meanings , and they correspond to the two different observational approaches towards measuring the galaxy merger rate . when the merger rate is measured via pair counting , the mass ( or luminosity ) of each galaxy in the pair is measured separately , and the merger fraction / rate is attributed to the measured progenitor galaxy mass . the merger rate in this case is related to the time scale for galaxies of a given mass / luminosity to encounter other galaxies of a given mass / luminosity , analogously to the merger rate per progenitor halo . in the case of morphological / kinematical identification of disturbed galaxies that show signs of mergers , it is difficult to infer the mass of each of the original components that have merged , and the merger is then attributed to the total mass of the system , i.e.  the descendant mass . in that case , the merger rate is related to the time scale on which a population of galaxies is created by mergers . while such observations still suffer from large uncertainties , it is important to realise that the merger rates that are inferred by both methods are not the same quantity .",
    "those two quantities are related to each other by our conversion formula , in a fully analogous way to the two definitions of the merger rate of dark matter halos .",
    "some evidence for the expected difference between the two methods can be found in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite measure the galaxy major merger rate in a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation , and define it as being per descendant galaxy .",
    "they find a steep monotonic relation between increasing mass and increasing merger rate , similar to the trend of the halo merger rate per descendant .",
    "also @xcite , measuring the merger fraction using a morphological investigation , find that the merger fraction ( at @xmath169 ) increases strongly with increasing mass . on the other hand , @xcite find that the major merger rate of galaxies , obtained via observed pair counting , peaks with respect to luminosity , therefore also with respect to mass .",
    "this different dependence , which at first might seem to be at odds with the findings of @xcite and @xcite , is actually qualitatively expected once it is taken into account that @xcite measure ( implicitly ) the merger rate per _ progenitor _ galaxy .",
    "therefore , when comparing either observed or simulated galaxy merger rates , the nature of the observations and the definition used to analyse the simulations must be taken into account . similarly , @xcite find that the redshift dependence of the merger fraction becomes stronger for higher mass galaxies , while @xcite , measuring the pair fraction of galaxies , find exactly the opposite trend , i.e.  that higher mass galaxies have a shalower redshift evolution .",
    "this is again in qualitative agreement with our expectations based on the difference between merger rates per progenitor and per descendant halo / galaxy .    to quantitatively compare observations with the frequency of galaxy mergers predicted by simulations , a treatment of baryonic physics",
    "must be included .",
    "such a comparison is outside the scope of this paper , but can be found in e.g.  @xcite and p.  f.  hopkins et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "however , we make here a comparison between the halo merger fraction ( per descendant halo ) in the millennium simulation and galaxy merger fractions ( per descendant galaxy ) from observations . in figure",
    "[ f : merger_fractions ] we show a compilation of observed galaxy merger fractions as a function of redshift .",
    "two features are apparent : the merger fraction increases with redshift , and the scatter at any given redshift is roughly a factor of @xmath170 .",
    "if we distinguish between fractions according to a rough luminosity / mass criteria , the large scatter remains .",
    "this is because the scatter is caused by numerous factors , e.g.  selection of different populations and different wavebands , different techniques for identifying mergers , as well as cosmic variance .    to extract merger fractions from the simulation",
    ", a time scale must be associated with mergers ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we use the dynamical friction time scale for dark matter halo mergers found by @xcite based on merger simulations .",
    "we average the orbital parameters and thereby obtain @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the mass ratio and @xmath173 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath174 . whenever a major merger occurs between snapshots @xmath19 and @xmath175 (  [ s : rates ] ) , we tag the most massive progenitor at snapshot @xmath19 , and its descendants in following snapshots , as `` undergoing a major merger '' for a time @xmath176 after snapshot @xmath19 .",
    "this allows us to determine , for any snapshot and halo mass range , the fraction of halos that are instantaneously undergoing major mergers , i.e.  the major merger fraction . in figure",
    "[ f : merger_fractions ] we plot the resulting major merger fraction as a function of redshift for three halo masses .",
    "we note that by tagging the progenitor halo only at snapshot @xmath19 and the descendant halos in the following snapshots for a duration @xmath176 , we derive a merger fraction that is mostly `` per descendant halo '' .",
    "we do that for two reasons .",
    "first , while a halo that is a descendant of a merger is a halo that hosts galaxies that are about to merge , it is probably observationally less relevant when two halos are still approaching their merger .",
    "second , it is unclear what time scale should be used for an imminent halo merger .",
    "the dynamical friction time scale is relevant only after the halos have started coalescing @xcite . in other words",
    ", there is no proper definition for a `` halo pair '' .",
    "we also note that the exact algorithm used for building the merger tree and the halo mass definition become relatively unimportant in this comparison due to the large uncertainties .",
    "@xcite , who performed a similar analysis , have also shown that it is possible to find a good rough agreement with observations while having much freedom in parameters like mass ratio and time scale .    ) in the millennium simulation are shown for 3 different halo masses , starting from the lowest halo mass we can reliably probe , that is @xmath177 .",
    "the sensitivity to the chosen mass ratio threshold is indicated in the lower right corner .",
    "a compilation of observational values that were obtained in different methods and with different selections nevertheless shows a rough agreement , also with the results from the simulation .",
    "the error bars of the observations are largely comparable or smaller than the spread , and for the simulation ( poisson errors ) they are very small . they have been suppressed to allow better readability . ]",
    "[ f : merger_fractions ]    the theoretical expectation for the dark matter halo merger fraction brackets the observations reasonably well .",
    "this suggests that , at least within the current uncertainties , the galaxy merger fraction roughly follows the dark matter halo merger fraction .",
    "this conclusion may seem to be different from the findings of @xcite , namely that the role of major mergers in galaxy growth is different from that in halo growth , but the two conclusions are actually consistent with each other . @xcite found that the specific formation rate of halos through major mergers increases steeply with redshift but depends weakly on mass , and vice versa for galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the specific formation rate they introduced is a different quantity from the merger fraction we show in figure [ f : merger_fractions ] .",
    "@xcite defined the specific formation rate such that it equals the merger rate per descendant halo as defined in this work , times the hubble time , with no dependence on the duration of mergers .",
    "thus , the difference they found between halos and galaxies originates solely from the difference of the merger _ rate _ between halos in the dark matter simulation and the galaxies in the semi - analytical model .",
    "@xcite found that the galaxy specific formation rate via major mergers is roughly constant with redshift , therefore by dividing it by the hubble time , we learn that the galaxy major merger rate scales roughly as @xmath178 . in comparison , they find that the halo specific formation rate via major mergers scales as @xmath179 , which after being devided by the hubble time means that the halo major merger rate scales as @xmath180 . this is consistent with our finding that the halo major merger rate scales roughly as @xmath181",
    ". however , the merger _ fraction _ is proportional also to the merger time scale .",
    "the time scale of halo mergers @xmath176 scales roughly as @xmath182 via its dependence on the hubble time , while the observed time scale for galaxy mergers is probably approximately constant with redshift ( e.g.  @xcite ) . combining these dependencies",
    ", one finds that both the halo merger fraction and the galaxy merger fraction scale roughly as @xmath179 , which is indeed what is seen on average in figure [ f : merger_fractions ] .",
    "we have used the millennium simulation to extract merger rates of dark matter halos .",
    "our method differs from previous work in three main aspects .",
    "first , we reject any merger between fof groups whose descendant subhalos , at any future time , do not belong exclusively to the same fof group .",
    "this is done by keeping such fof groups distinct until they ( if at all ) irrevocably merge .",
    "rejecting only a fraction of such events , as in previous work , leads to double counting of mergers , and to false counting of fly - by events as mergers .",
    "therefore , our method results in a lower merger rate , especially in the minor merger regime .",
    "@xcite find that ejections of low mass subhalos out of their host halos typically occur in a configuration where a bound group of subhalos ( which was created via past mergers ) is accreted onto a large halo , and its low mass members are propelled onto high energy orbits by the multiple - body interaction . in the context of merger counting , it is not clear whether the merger of the low mass halo with the group should be counted as a merger , or merely regarded as an interaction that was interrupted by the accretion of the group onto the large halo .",
    "our method assumes the latter for reasons described in  [ s : new_trees ] .",
    "therefore , in a more conservative approach , our results can be regarded to as a strong lower limit for the merger rate .",
    "second , we define each halo s mass as the mass of all the particles gravitationally bound to it , rather than of all the particles constituting the fof group .",
    "this definition reduces the inferred merger rate by typically @xmath154 .",
    "the motivation for this definition is our finding that the total ( bound & unbound ) mass of fof groups artificially increases by up to @xmath0 as they approach more massive fof groups on their way to merge with them .",
    "this effect distorts the appropriate mass ratios of mergers , thereby changing the merger rate .",
    "a detailed discussion of this issue appears in  [ s : mass_def ] .",
    "these two improvements make our inferred merger rate more consistent with the new predictions of @xcite based on the eps model , in the sense that the functional dependencies of the merger rate on mass ratio , halo mass and redshift are very similar .",
    "there is a constant factor of @xmath183 between the eps merger rate and the millennium simulation merger rate . in ",
    "[ s : rates_desc ] we provide a simple global fitting formula ( equation ( [ e : rate_desc ] ) ) for the merger rate per descendant halo that holds for @xmath83 and all masses probed by the millennium simulation .",
    "third , we also extract the merger rate per _ progenitor _ halo .",
    "this allows us to find a merger rate for the full range of mass ratios .",
    "for halos of any mass @xmath42 , we can measure the rate at which they undergo minor mergers , major mergers and the rate at which they are being accreted as satellite halos onto more massive halos .",
    "this has significant implications for the redshift and mass dependencies of the major merger rate .",
    "we find the merger rate , in the regime where both halo masses are smaller than the knee of the mass function , to increase steeply with redshift and only slightly with mass , in a similar way to what was found in previous work .",
    "however , at high enough mass or redshift , the number of halos decreases exponentially and therefore the mass dependence of the major merger rate changes sign and starts decreasing with increasing mass .",
    "also , the redshift dependence significantly weakens . in  [ s : comparison_prog_desc ] we provide an analytic expression for converting merger rates per descendant halo to merger rates per progenitor halo , which can be used for any theoretical merger rate .",
    "the two different definitions of the merger rate , per progenitor halo and per descendant halo , have different physical meanings .",
    "they also correspond to the two different observational approaches towards measuring the galaxy merger rate , namely pair counting and morphological / kinematical identification . in  [ s : merger_fractions ] we discuss the importance of this distinction and its relevance to observations . finally , we find that observed galaxy merger fractions are consistent with the halo merger fraction in the millennium simulation within the large observational uncertainties and uncertainties in parameters ( like mass ratio or time scale ) needed to compare the two .",
    "more refined comparisons still await significant improvements both in observational techniques and consistency and in the theoretical treatment of baryonic physics .",

    "the merger rate per halo equals , in general , the number of merger events divided by the number of halos undergoing those mergers .",
    "let us denote by @xmath184 the number of mergers that occur between @xmath109 and @xmath110 , whose descendant mass is @xmath185 and ratio is @xmath186 .",
    "similarly the number of mergers whose more massive progenitor mass is @xmath185 and ratio is @xmath186 are denoted as @xmath187 , and accordingly for the less massive progenitor : @xmath188 .",
    "we will define the halo mass function is the following way : if @xmath189 is the number of halos more massive than @xmath42 at redshift @xmath174 , then the number of halos in the interval @xmath185 is @xmath190 . for simplicity , in the following derivation",
    "we assume the binary merger approximation .",
    "as shown below , the analytic formula we derive reproduces well the numerical results , therefore we conclude that for this matter , this approximation is not significant .    without loss of generality , we may assume @xmath191 , therefore the progenitor masses of mergers whose descendant mass is @xmath185 and ratio is @xmath186 are @xmath192 and @xmath193 . therefore , @xmath184 is also exactly the number of mergers whose more massive progenitor mass is @xmath194 and ratio is @xmath186 , as well as the number of mergers whose less massive progenitor mass is @xmath195 and ratio is @xmath186 .",
    "therefore we can write the equalities @xmath196    the number of mergers _ per descendant halo _ , whose descendant mass is @xmath185 and ratio is @xmath186 , is simply @xmath197 and similarly the number of mergers _ per progenitor halo _ , whose more massive progenitor mass is @xmath198 and ratio is @xmath186 , is @xmath199 where equations ( [ e : number_of_mergers ] ) and ( [ e : number_of_mergers_per_desc_halo ] ) were used in the first and second equalities , respectively .",
    "scaling the mass from @xmath198 to @xmath42 , we finally arrive at @xmath200 which is the relation between the merger rate per more - massive - progenitor halo and the merger rate per descendant halo",
    ".      equations ( [ e : number_of_mergers_per_prog_halo ] ) & ( [ e : number_of_mergers_per_prog_halo_small_x ] ) construct the merger rate per progenitor halo as defined in ",
    "[ s : rates ] from the merger rate per descendant halo , and can be applied regardless of the source of the given merger rate per descendant halo .    in order to compare the two quantities , it is more convenient to examine equation ( [ e : number_of_mergers_per_prog_halo ] ) , because both definitions of the merger rate are quantified in its validity range , i.e.  @xmath58 .",
    "the largest source of difference is the term @xmath204 . for @xmath42",
    "smaller than the knee of the mass function , where it is roughly a power law with @xmath42 , this term is constant with @xmath42 for a given @xmath30 , i.e.  the trend of the merger rate with mass stays the same .",
    "as opposed to that , where the mass function begins to drop exponentially , this term decreases exponentially with @xmath42 as well , and therefore so does @xmath205 .    for completeness",
    "we show also how the merger rate per descendant halo can be derived from the merger rate per progenitor halo : @xmath206 as well as how the two regimes of the merger rate per progenitor halo are related to one another : @xmath207"

    "<S> we have developed a new method to extract halo merger rates from the millennium simulation . </S>",
    "<S> first , by removing superfluous mergers that are artifacts of the standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) halo identification algorithm , we find a lower merger rate compared to previous work . </S>",
    "<S> the reductions are more significant at lower redshifts and lower halo masses , and especially for minor mergers . our new approach results in a better agreement with predictions from the extended press - schechter model . </S>",
    "<S> second , we find that the fof halo finder overestimates the halo mass by up to @xmath0 for halos that are about to merge , which leads to an additional @xmath1 overestimate of the merger rate . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we define halo masses by including only particles that are gravitationally bound to their fof groups . </S>",
    "<S> we provide new best - fitting parameters for a global formula to account for these improvements . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we extract the merger rate per _ progenitor _ halo , as well as per descendant halo . </S>",
    "<S> the merger rate per progenitor halo is the quantity that should be related to observed galaxy merger fractions when they are measured via pair counting . at low mass / redshift the merger rate increases moderately with mass and steeply with redshift . at high enough mass / redshift ( for the rarest halos with masses a few times the `` knee '' of the mass function ) these trends break down , and the merger rate per progenitor halo decreases with mass and increases only moderately with redshift . defining the merger rate per progenitor halo also allows us to quantify the rate at which halos are being accreted onto larger halos , in addition to the minor and major merger rates . </S>",
    "<S> we provide an analytic formula that converts any given merger rate per descendant halo into a merger rate per progenitor halo . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we perform a direct comparison between observed merger fractions and the fraction of halos in the millennium simulation that have undergone a major merger during the recent dynamical friction time , and find a fair agreement , within the large uncertainties of the observations . </S>",
