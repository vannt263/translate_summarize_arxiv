    "in nearly all magnetic ob stars the dipole component is dominant . as the rotation and magnetic axis do not coincide in general , these objects act as oblique rotators .",
    "the outflowing stellar wind is perturbed by the surface magnetic field , and is periodically modified .",
    "in fact , the discovery of a number of magnetic early - type stars was preceded by the discovery of strictly periodic wind variability as observed in the uv , which appeared to be the strongest indirect indicator for the presence of a magnetic field . by this method three magnetic b stars",
    "have been found : @xmath1 cep ( @xcite ) , @xmath2 cas , and v2052 oph ( @xcite ) , with rotation periods of 12 d , 5.4 d and 3.6 d , respectively .    in our search for stellar wind variability in the iue archives",
    ", we found that the b1/b2v star @xmath0 lup had variable uv wind lines ( fig.1a ) , similar to other magnetic b stars .",
    "this prompted us to observe this star with sempol at the aat , with follow - up observations in the frame of the mimes collaboration .",
    "we describe here the discovery of the magnetic field and its further analysis .      from the lsd spectra we computed the mean longitudinal field ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the smallest error bars are about 16 g. the best fit of the function @xmath13 gives : @xmath14 g , @xmath15 g , @xmath16 d , and @xmath17 jd @xmath18 with a reduced @xmath19 .",
    "this function together with the data as a function of phase are plotted in fig.1b ( middle ) .",
    "we identify the photometric period with the rotation period . from @xmath8sin@xmath20 and",
    "the estimated stellar radius follows @xmath21 .",
    "the magnetic tilt angle @xmath1 is then constrained by the observed ratio @xmath22 , implying @xmath1 close to @xmath23 .",
    "the photometric period is @xmath24 d ( @xcite ) , determined 3147 cycles earlier .",
    "the extrapolated epoch of maximum light coincides within the uncertainties with the epoch of maximum ( positive ) magnetic field .",
    "the assumption that these epochs are equal allows a more accurate determination of the period : @xmath25 d , i.e. within 12 s. new photometry would be able to confirm this .",
    "the three previously discovered magnetic b stars ( @xmath1 cep , @xmath2 cas and v2052 oph ) showed a double sine wave in the equivalent width of the uv wind lines , with the maximum emission ( minimum ew ) coinciding with maximum field strength , i.e.  at the phase when a magnetic pole is pointed towards the observer . because of the particular spacing of the 4 datapoints a fit of a double sine wave is not meaningful , but the expected curve ( with arbitrary scaling , see fig.1b , top ) suggests similar behavior for @xmath0 lup as well .",
    "this supports a model with the emitting material in the magnetic equatorial plane ."

    "<S> the ultraviolet stellar wind lines of the photometrically periodic variable early b - type star @xmath0 lupi were found to behave very similarly to what has been observed in known magnetic b stars , although no periodicity could be determined . </S>",
    "<S> aat spectropolarimetric measurements with sempol were obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we detected a longitudinal magnetic field with varying strength and amplitude of about 100 g with error bars of typically 20 g. this type of variability supports an oblique magnetic rotator model . </S>",
    "<S> we fold the equivalent width of the 4 usable uv spectra in phase with the well - known photometric period of 3.019 days , which we identify with the rotation period of the star . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field variations are consistent with this period . </S>",
    "<S> additional observations with espadons attached to the cfht strongly confirmed this discovery , and allowed to determine a precise magnetic period . like in the other magnetic b stars the wind emission likely originates in the magnetic equatorial plane , with maximum emission occurring when a magnetic pole points towards the earth . </S>",
    "<S> the 3.0182 d magnetic rotation period is consistent with the photometric period , with maximum light corresponding to maximum magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> no helium or other chemical peculiarity is known for this object . </S>"
