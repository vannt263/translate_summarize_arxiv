    "this introduction is somewhat lengthy : it is designed to familiarize the general reader with the project .",
    "my collaborators may want to skip most of it .",
    "it is a paradox of proton radiotherapy that its most distinctive feature , the sharp distal edge of the depth - dose curve ( bragg peak ) , is rarely used to cut between tissue to be treated and tissue to be spared .",
    "the reason is that the exact stopping point of the proton beam is usually uncertain to a few millimeters owing to such factors as uncertainty in ct number to range conversion , approximations in the dose algorithm , day to day setup , and day to day changes in internal patient anatomy .",
    "much effort has been invested in techniques ( pet imaging and prompt gamma ray detection among others ) hoping to improve on this situation .",
    "the particular idea we pursue here is not new . at the harvard cyclotron laboratory around 1981 ,",
    "miles wagner inserted a dosimeter in the oral cavity of patients undergoing head - and - neck radiotherapy .",
    "if a proton beam employing a rotating range modulator is used it is possible to infer , from the shape of the dose v. time in the dosimeter , the water equivalent depth of the dosimeter .",
    "that information can be used to correct the beam energy on that day .",
    "unfortunately , the technique ( ` synchroprobe ' ) did not enjoy clinical acceptance , and was never published .",
    "our iba / mgh / harvard group is currently directing its efforts , instead , at potential ap fields in prostate radiotherapy , where the organ to be treated is the prostate and the organ to be spared is the rectal wall .",
    "the dosimeter can be attached to a rectal balloon and pressed against the rectal wall .",
    "lu @xcite described the technique and investigated it in a water phantom .",
    "the dosimeter ( a small ionization chamber ) was calibrated by recording dose v. time patterns at many depths in a water tank exposed to a ` scout beam ' ( our term ) having somewhat excess range .",
    "an unknown depth could subsequently be determined by finding which calibration pattern matched best .",
    "the technique was accurate to @xmath12 mm .",
    "later , our attention shifted to semiconductor diodes , being small , inexpensive , rugged two - terminal devices which do not require bias voltage .",
    "the first experimental study @xcite used a ptw diode designed for dosimetry , driving a reasonably fast ( @xmath13s ) current - to - voltage amplifier whose output was sampled by a digital oscilloscope . instead of a relatively smooth dose v. time signal , a sequence of random pulses is observed ( figure[fig : raw123ch2ch4 ] ) , each representing one or a few protons : the effective diode area is so small that the quantization of proton fluence becomes evident .",
    "pattern matching no longer works , but it was found that a simpler method based on @xmath4 , the rms width of the time distribution , worked even better , yielding sub - mm accuracy .",
    "( it also works for smooth distributions as with ionization chambers . )    since that publication , we have improved the equipment and answered a number of questions .",
    "we have built a 12-channel amplifier which drives an off - the - shelf 12-channel sampling analog - to - digital converter .",
    "that allows an array of diodes to be used rather than just one , whose position might prove unfavorable .",
    "we have found that standard , inexpensive surface - mount diodes dflr1600 work as well as the ptw diode . their calibration is identical , and independent of diode orientation .",
    "being in essence a measure of the time distribution , @xmath4 appears to depend on beam parameters rather than properties of the dosimeter .",
    "the present report covers data taken earlier this year with the multi - channel equipment , first in a water tank and then , with the addition of a more efficient trigger and a beam monitor , in a pelvic phantom .",
    "the first run 09mar11 sought to calibrate the diode array .",
    "the second 15jun11 investigated whether the ` dose extinction ' ( de ) method ( reducing the beam range until the signal goes away ) correlates with the ` scout beam ' ( sb ) method just described .",
    "we have ignored a few other runs of doubtful value .",
    "shikui tang has already discussed these data in a series of internal reports @xcite which we ll refer to collectively as st .",
    "they cover much of the same ground .",
    "indeed , they go further in relating what each diode observes to its position in the phantom ( using x - ray and treatment planning information ) whereas we will confine ourselves to what can be deduced from the diode signals alone .    however , our methods are substantially different even where our conclusions agree .",
    "we treat the dc voltage offset problem from first principles and use it to correct the de distributions .",
    "st ( who refers to it as ` dose background ' ) computes it by an undisclosed method , but eventually abandons that , essentially making the toe of the de distribution zero by definition . that only works , of course , for data sets which include the toe .",
    "st computes such quantities as @xmath5 by fitting a polynomial to a limited ( and therefore arbitrary ) region of the de falloff , whereas we fit the entire distribution , including data from the scout beam .",
    "thus our procedure has fewer arbitrary steps . nevertheless , the correlations found between de and sb measurements are very similar in the two analyses , testifying to the robustness of that result .",
    "the central problem of proton dosimetry  for instance , computing the dose distribution in the patient  is that , owing to the interplay of transverse heterogeneity with multiple coulomb scattering , protons can reach the same point with different energy - loss histories and therefore , different stopping powers . in early publications e.g.@xcite",
    "this was called ` degradation of the bragg peak ' .",
    "nowadays it has the better name ` range mixing ' .",
    "it poses a serious problem to the sb method of determining the water equivalent path length ( wepl ) to a given point .",
    "even if an sb measurement yields some number for @xmath4 ( it always will ) if there are multiple paths ( wepls ) to the diode in question that number conveys no useful information and must be disregarded .",
    "that is one reason we use an array rather than a single diode .",
    "the heterogeneities in a typical prostate ap plan allow us to hope that at least a few diodes will see pure rather than range - mixed protons , but we must identify those diodes . knowing the diode positions from x - rays we might try to predict , from the treatment plan , which diodes are trustworthy , but it would be simpler operationally if we could deduce that directly from the diode signals .",
    "the method proposed assumes only that , when range mixing occurs , it results in some change in the distribution of signal v. time for that diode . if we knew the set of distributions measured at calibration time ( no range mixing ) and the distribution at measurement time ( suspected range mixing ) we could simply compare the latter with the former using the @xmath11 test @xcite and find , perhaps , that none of them match .",
    "but we know neither parent distribution , only random samples of each .",
    "however , if two distributions differ , at least one of their moments must differ , and we do have multiple samples , both at calibration time and measurement time , which yield moments and their estimated measurement errors . accordingly , given some @xmath4 , we ask whether the next odd and even central moments ( the skewness @xmath6 and kurtosis @xmath7 ) agree with their ` natural ' values at that @xmath4 , measured at calibration time . as a measure of agreement we use the quantity @xmath14 , familiar from statistics , namely the probability of seeing a given deviation from a normal distribution purely by chance .",
    "very small @xmath14 will indicate range mixing in that diode .",
    "this report documents construction , experiment and analysis performed since the last publication .",
    "it also explores the skewness / kurtosis method of identifying range mixing , which looks promising but needs further work .",
    "we begin ( section[sec : hardware ] ) by describing new hardware : the home - made 12-channel amplifier , cables , and commercial 12-channel data logger .",
    "we next ( section[sec : software ] ) describe a fortran program arrayrms purpose - written to analyze the data , performing calibration , dose extinction and moments analysis as necessary .",
    "it grew from a collection of _ ad hoc _ programs and , we hope , may provide the outline for a stable multi - task program in the future . before describing the architecture of arrayrms , section[sec : software ]",
    "covers some mathematics of a general nature .",
    "next we cover results from the 09mar11 calibration run ( section[sec:09mar11 ] ) and the 15jun11 pelvic phantom run ( section[sec:15jun11 ] ) .",
    "finally we summarize ( section[sec : discussion ] ) with some suggestions for the future .",
    "the amplifier is dc coupled and good output offset stability is important , so the 12-channel box is furnished with an on - board @xmath15v tracking supply ( figure[fig : powersupplies ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward : a precise 2.5v reference , a @xmath16 amplifier and an inverting amplifier .",
    "the transistors increase the available output current , while the @xmath17 resistors reduce transistor dissipation and protect the transistors against output shorts .",
    "the amplifier itself ( figure[fig:12chanamplifier ] ) consist of two transimpedance ( current - to - voltage ) amplifiers ( gain 2mv / na ) , a difference amplifier ( gain @xmath18 ) and an output stage ( nominal gain @xmath19 ) .",
    "the choice of opamp is critical : we require very low bias current , low noise , low offset drift with temperature and time , and moderate speed . corresponding tlc2202 specs ( typical ) are 1pa , 8nv/@xmath20 ( 1khz ) , 0.5@xmath21v/@xmath22c , 0.001@xmath21v / month and @xmath23mhz .",
    "there are two dc adjustments .",
    "burden ensures that the voltage across the diode , imposed by the amplifier inputs , is @xmath24v .",
    "otherwise a ` diode leakage current ' , actually due to the voltage burden across the finite diode resistance at @xmath25 , will flow .",
    "burden is adjusted by substituting ( say ) 10k for the diode and setting the output voltage to zero . because a typical diode resistance is far greater , this need not be too precise .",
    "offset is adjusted by setting the output voltage to 0 with the input open .",
    "you may need to repeat burden and offset once or twice .",
    "setting gain requires a well shielded , floating , balanced na source .",
    "we built a calibration source with a battery , range setting potentiometer , front panel dial potentiometer and a large resistor inside an aluminum box ( figure[fig : calibrator ] ) .",
    "the switch reverses polarity to check linearity .",
    "prior to the 15jun11 run all channels were adjusted to 0.5v / na @xmath26 . the precision may seem superfluous because of the large diode - to - diode variations expected , but it will allow one eventually to test for long term effects such as radiation damage to the amplifiers .",
    "layout is critical to prevent oscillation and crosstalk in these very high gain , fairly fast amplifiers .",
    "it goes without saying that any amplifier s output should be placed distant from its input .",
    "in addition , the 12 channels were deliberately arranged so the output of one amplifier never abuts the input of another .",
    "( the fact that the input is balanced helps , but it is never exactly balanced . ) an estimate of the current induced through 0.1pc of unbalanced capacitance by a typical 1v , 20@xmath21s output pulse is 1v@xmath270.1pc/20@xmath21s=5na , of the order of input currents expected .",
    "we checked for crosstalk between typical channels and none was observed .",
    "the 12-channel amplifier , placed fairly near the proton beam , is connected to the treatment control room ( tcr ) by twelve 75foot runs of rg-178b / u miniature teflon - insulated 50@xmath28 coaxial cable , terminated in db9s connectors ( amplifier end ) and male bncs ( tcr end ) . the cable is wound on an orange reel . in paying out or winding back the cable",
    ", one should _ not _ pass it over the side of the reel , convenient as that may seem .",
    "that introduces kinks which , if pulled tight , will eventually break the cable .",
    "one should instead grab the internal black handle and pull cable straight off the reel or , at the end of the run , wind it straight back on using the black knob .",
    "there is no effective way of repairing the cable once it is broken .",
    "the data logger is an iotech6220 ( measurement computing corp . , 10 commerce way , suite 1008 , norton , ma 02766 , usa ) .",
    "we give only a brief description for background . for details , consult the specifications and the user s manual both of which are available at the measurement computing web site .",
    "the main feature is a 12 channel 16 bit analog to digital converter ( adc ) capable of sampling each channel simultaneously at 100khz .",
    "internally , the 6220 employs three multiplexed 4-channel adc s so ` simultaneous ' actually means ` within the same 10@xmath21s ' but that is more than adequate .",
    "the @xmath29 internal structure explains why channels 14 have a common ground and so on .",
    "the input voltage range is @xmath30v so the least bit corresponds to @xmath31mv .",
    "the input impedance is 200k .",
    "the 6220 also has flexible 8bit digital i / o ( ttl levels ) brought to a rear panel db9s connector .",
    "lines 07 are connected to pins 18 respectively ; pin 9 is ground .",
    "we built an adapter cable which makes lines 03 available on bnc connectors .",
    "the 15jun11 run used line 0 as a trigger and line 1 as a counter .",
    "the 09mar11 run used neither .",
    "line 0 was connected to the facility ` boxb ' signal ( essentially a ` beam on ' signal ) via a level translator furnished by ethan .",
    "although the software trigger settings were not changed during the run , the time at which beam actually appears , as evidenced by diode pulses , varied from one 20burst ( 2s ) sample to the next . as a result",
    "the _ absolute _ timing between pulses and boxb , which might conceivably be useful , appears to be of no value in this run and was not used .",
    "this variable trigger delay is not understood at present .",
    "line 1 was driven by the same signal that drives the dceu input via an interface supplied by ethan .",
    "it therefore served as a beam monitor with 300 counts = 1 monitor unit ( mu ) as presently used at the burr center .",
    "when a line is set up as a counter , it evidently drives an internal scaler whose output is sampled at the global rate , here 100khz .",
    "since a 20 bunch ( 2s ) sample only corresponds to a few hundred counts , the text file might be expected to contain many instances of 0 followed by many instances of 1 and so on : a staircase starting at 0 .",
    "however , we did not generally observe 0 as the start count but instead , some small number varying from one 2s sample to the next .",
    "this , too , is not yet understood .",
    "we assumed that the _ difference _ between the last and the first step reflected the true number of dceu counts .",
    "data logging software called encore1.1 is supplied with the iotech6220 .",
    "it is launched by double clicking the encore project icon on the toshiba r705 desktop .",
    "the project can be edited and re - saved to preserve settings .",
    "there is reasonably good online help , and we will not attempt to describe the software in detail .",
    "as set up for the last data run ( 15jun11 ) described here , we took 200k samples ( 2s ) on each of 12 channels at 100ksamples / sec .",
    "one needs to turn off the simultaneous display to do this ; otherwise buffer overflow will occur .",
    "data acquisition was triggered by the boxb signal ( digital i / o line 0 ) and the dceu signal was counted ( totalized ) as a beam monitor ( line 1 ) . after acquisition , text files were exported automatically .",
    "( encore initially logs data in a proprietary format which is not generally useful . )    for setup runs , data logging ( as opposed to display ) can be toggled on / off in the main menu .",
    "the distinction between single shot operation and ordinary start / auto stop is not totally clear , and one is well advised to practice a few times and check the logged files before commencing serious work .",
    "encore will compute and display waveform parameters such as mean and rms voltage , but the machinery is somewhat cumbersome and we did not use it except on the bench . displaying the logged waveform in playback mode from time to time proved sufficient to monitor data integrity .",
    "eventually , pre - analysis by arrayrms should be available , for the same purpose .",
    "fortran program arrayrms.for analyzes the data . at present",
    "it is somewhat cluttered because of frequent changes in hardware configuration , data storage and analysis goals during this early phase of the research program .",
    "however , the basic structure seems sound . as things settle down it will be possible to trim away some of the complications .",
    "the current version of arrayrms , along with all supporting program modules , can be found in    @xmath32bgware@xmath32source athttp://physics.harvard.edu / gottschalk    the toshibar705 notebook used for data collection runs 64 bit windows7 and will not run our 32 bit fortran compiler .",
    "it will , however , run the executables produced .",
    "our long term plan is to copy arrayrms.exe to the r705 , allowing one to preprocess the ( very long ) data files without transferring them to another computer .",
    "this step generates summary txt files which have all the intermediate results necessary for further analysis ( see section[sec : prelim ] ) , and will also allow one to see how a data - taking run is progressing .",
    "however , all analysis for this report was done on our personal computer , a lenovot400 notebook running windowsxp professional .",
    "either machine processes one raw data file ( 2s worth of data or 20 bursts or @xmath33msamples ) in less than 1s .",
    "data from a three - hour run takes a couple of minutes to pre - process ( task prelim described below ) .",
    "this section begins with some mathematical considerations and closes with a short description of arrayrms from the user s point of view .",
    "the current - to - voltage amplifier must be dc coupled .",
    "otherwise , rate dependent baseline shifts would make data analysis impossible .",
    "given the high amplifier gain , it is inevitable that dc output voltages of order @xmath34mv will , after some time , appear on some channels even if initially zeroed , as was done . assuming @xmath35mv , an amplifier gain of @xmath36v / na , and an integration time of 2s ( 20 bursts ) the associated spurious charge @xmath37 is @xmath38",
    "since it will turn out that the total charge collected in 20 bursts is of order 100pc and the baseline dc voltage can be several mv , this correction is small but not negligible .",
    "its most obvious effect is that , in dose extinction measurements , the charge detected does not approach zero as the beam range decreases .",
    "the effect on scout beam measurements ( that is , on @xmath4 ) is less clear , and may be very small .",
    "the correction is named vcorr ( here @xmath39 ) in our software .",
    "it will eventually be subtracted from each voltage reading before any further analysis .",
    "@xmath39 is found channel - by - channel by analyzing the frequency distribution ( spectrum ) of all 200k voltage readings ( assuming 20 bursts ) in three successive passes .",
    "the first pass ( not shown ) serves merely to establish a rough value , typically very near zero .",
    "the second pass zooms in on the spectrum , using a much smaller bin width .",
    "figure[fig : freq052_1_3_0_90 ] , with a bin width of @xmath40mv , illustrates one pitfall .",
    "the least bit of the adc equals @xmath41mv and any bin width of that order will yield spikes ( figure[fig : freq052_1_3_0_90 ] ) owing to the differential nonlinearity which is characteristic of successive approximation adc s .",
    "we will need to smooth the spectrum , and the spikes make it difficult to smooth .",
    "we investigated the quantization by looking at the distribution of differences between successive voltage readings , and found that @xmath42v and @xmath43v came up frequently .",
    "we do not understand the latter value , but using a bin width of @xmath44v consistently gave a spectrum like figure[fig : freq052_504_3_0_90 ] , converting the spikes to an odd / even pattern which is easy to smooth ( figure[fig : freq052_504_3_1_90 ] ) .",
    "however , figure[fig : freq052_504_3_1_90 ] shows a positive tail , due to signal pulses , which will have a non - negligible effect on the mean of the distribution even if we compute it for a narrow region about the peak .",
    "we therefore proceed by looking for bursts .",
    "if we find the expected 20 ( or whatever ) we exclude the in - burst signal , recompute the spectrum , and compute its mean over a fairly narrow region ( figure[fig : freq053_504_3_1_90 ] ) .",
    "there is a borderline subset of data where bursts are still present but the burst finding algorithm fails to detect the expected number . here",
    "it can probably be argued that a sufficient fraction of the trace is baseline ( figure[fig : rawdata_55_ch7 ] ) that burst removal is not so important .",
    "indeed figure[fig : vcorr3pass ] , a history of @xmath39 through the 15jun11 run , shows very little correlation of @xmath39 with the measurements being made , in contrast with figure[fig : vcorr2pass ] , the same history with the in - burst signal left in .",
    "the dependence of @xmath39 on run conditions is spurious .      in a notation suitable to our application ,",
    "the conventional definitions of the first five moments of a distribution are @xcite @xmath45 @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 as defined here are ` central ' moments : they are computed relative to the mean .",
    "@xmath46 is the corrected voltage ( @xmath47 ) sampled at time @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the first and last indices of the burst . if the number of bursts detected equals the number expected ( e.g. 20 ) , prelim computes each statistic separately for each burst , finally returning the mean of those values and their rms deviation from the mean , a measure of the random error in that statistic for that channel .",
    "eqs.[eqn : sum][eqn : kurtosis ] define how a given moment is computed for a single burst .",
    "it remains to describe how arrayrms computes the moments and estimates their errors for repeated measurements .",
    "let us , by way of example , focus on a single channel and consider skewness and its rms deviation from the mean ( @xmath6 and @xmath50 ) as measured in @xmath51 repeated files each comprising @xmath52 bursts .",
    "on 15jun11 we took , for each sb measurement , four files ( @xmath53 ) of 20 bursts each ( @xmath54 ) for @xmath55 measurements in all .",
    "initially , statistics are computed burst by burst .",
    "next , rather than averaging all 80 measurements , that is , computing @xmath56 it proves more convenient to proceed file by file , averaging over 20 bursts to obtain @xmath57 for each . then , in order to use all the data , we average over four files to obtain @xmath58 for @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 themselves this procedure makes no difference as it is easily shown that e.g @xmath59 however , except for the trivial case @xmath60 , @xmath61    to investigate , we picked 80 numbers at random from a gaussian of mean @xmath62 and rms deviation @xmath63 , analyzed them in @xmath64 groups of @xmath65 , and repeated the experiment ten times .",
    "as figure[fig : grouprms ] shows , @xmath66 decreases with @xmath52 , simply because @xmath67 for small samples underestimates the parent @xmath67 by the well known ` bias ' factor @xmath68 , shown for comparison @xcite .",
    "( evidently it is only approximate . ) for @xmath54 this correction is 2.5% , and we ignore it .",
    "our hypothesis is that , in the presence of range mixing , the skewness of the burst distribution at a given observed @xmath4 will differ from its ` natural ' value , that is , from the function @xmath2 observed in a homogeneous water phantom ; also , that the same holds true for kurtosis ; and finally , that skewness and kurtosis are independent .",
    "put another way ( and focusing on skewness for now ) , in the absence of range mixing the mean excess skewness will be zero , with some statistical error that we are in a position to estimate .",
    "if in a given case the excess skewness deviates from zero , the statistic @xmath69 is the probability of a deviation that large occurring at random .",
    "the smaller @xmath69 is , the greater the likelihood that something other than random fluctuation is going on .    to compute @xmath69 we need the excess skewness itself and an estimate of the error in the mean of the skewness distribution . we know",
    "the rms spread in the distribution of @xmath6 namely @xmath70 ( with a negligible correction factor ) .",
    "let us guess that the rms error in the natural function @xmath2 is comparable to @xmath70 , introducing a factor @xmath71 .",
    "the error in the mean of a distribution is @xmath72 where @xmath52 is the number of measurements in the distibution @xcite . putting all that together @xmath73",
    "the @xmath14 value is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the observed deviation divided by the error in the mean .    for a concrete example",
    "we look ahead to table[tbl : scoutresults ] , the entries for channel 4 of the ap+rc configuration .",
    "the observed excess skewness is 2.4% and the error in the mean is 0.961% giving @xmath76 , a @xmath77 effect with @xmath78 as listed in the column labeled @xmath8 .",
    "together with an even smaller @xmath9 from excess kurtosis this yields a product @xmath79 , ruling out a mere statistical fluctuation .",
    "the diode calibration function @xmath0 ( or wepl(t@xmath80 ) or simply wepl ) is a five term ( fourth degree ) polynomial .",
    "figure[fig : weplparms ] ( top ) shows a sample parameter file .",
    "line 1 is the number of terms and line 2 gives two parameters ( midpoint of @xmath75 range and @xmath81 ) used in the linear transformation of @xmath75 described next .",
    "line 3 is the array of coefficients and line 4 is an array of corresponding error estimates @xcite .",
    "figure[fig : weplparms ] also shows code to read back the fit parameters , code to evaluate the fit , and the equivalent algebraic formulas .",
    "instead of directly fitting a polynomial to @xmath82 we first transform @xmath75 to a linearly related variable @xmath83 such that @xmath84 .",
    "that makes the polynomial coefficients easier to understand : each is simply the size of that term in the fit at the positive endpoint @xmath85 , and its relative importance can be seen directly .",
    "( for instance , the fifth term ( both from its magnitude and its error estimate ) is not really necessary here , but it does no harm . )",
    "more important , the transformation renders the matrix to be inverted during the computation much better conditioned , permitting high - order fits which would otherwise fail .",
    "( an even better linear transformation , in that regard , is one which makes the standard deviation of the transformed @xmath75 variable unity . )",
    "the transformation is not strictly necessary here , but we have made it standard practice for polynomial fits .",
    "we handle functions not suitable for polynomials ( dose extinction curves and natural skewness and kurtosis ) by means of cubic spline or broken spline fits .",
    "a very brief description follows . for a full one see fitdd.pdf in @xmath32bgdocs at http://physics.harvard.edu/gottschalk .    to perform a cubic spline fit to a set of data points @xmath82 ( which , for our routines , must have monotonically increasing @xmath86 with no duplicate values ) pick a much smaller set of ` spline points ' which are similar to instances of the data set , and whose coordinates will be the adjustable parameters of the fit .",
    "adjust those so a cubic spline passed through them approximates the data set in the usual ( least squares ) sense .",
    "interior spline points can move vertically and sideways , but end spline points can only move vertically : otherwise the fit will collapse .",
    "the hardest ( and most application specific ) part of the procedure is picking reasonable initial spline points .",
    "see fitdd.pdf for details .    if the data to be fit include corners , a single cubic spline ( which is smooth  no corners  by definition ) will not do . in that case ,",
    "fit with a ` broken spline ' , a set of separate cubic spline segments such that the first derivative is continuous everywhere but at the corners .",
    "the best locations of the corners will be found automatically during optimization of the spline points .    in our software",
    "a simple cubic spline fit is handled as a special case ( one segment ) of a broken spline .",
    "a segment through just two points degenerates automatically to a straight line .",
    "figure[fig : extbsfit11 ] shows a broken spline fit ( solid line ) of a dose extinction curve .",
    "the small circles are input data .",
    "squares are the spline points , and bold squares are the corners .",
    "what motivates the fit is that , once done , such descriptors of the curve as the 100% level or the depth at the 50% level can be found easily using standard routines .",
    "working directly with the experimental data would be much messier , and subject to random noise .",
    "figure[fig : bsfit11parms ] shows the corresponding parameter file .",

    "that suggests a more precise fit could be obtained with more attention to orthogonality to the beam , array flatness and diode orientation and , of course , more diodes .",

    "on 14jun11 , a day before the run , we bench tested various cable / diode combinations : open amplifier , adapter only , adapter plus diode array and so on .",
    "we used the iotech6220 with a dummy trigger to collect data and we used arrayrms.for for analysis , here limited to finding the dc offset and rms noise ( including 60hz pickup ) in each channel .",

    "( in these tests the cables and diodes were lying on the bench , but we had removed any obvious 60hz related sources such as transformers and fluorescent lamps .",
    "the 60hz environment of a treatment room is different , of course , and probably worse due to multiple electronic devices . )",

    "the bare amplifier is at @xmath94 , and the points labeled ` adapter ' show the noise introduced by the adapter cable alone .",

    "i believe the ` blue ' array was used for the 15jun11 run .",
    "only eight of the twelve diodes were useful .",
    "one faulty channel was due to the adapter cable , another was pinned ( probably one side grounded ) , and two of the diodes gave much less signal than the good eight .",
    "1020% interdiode variation in sensitivity , probably due to differences in active si mass , seems to be normal .",
    "this run used a pelvic phantom .",
    "the phantom was aligned in the beam , the externally shielded diode array was inserted around the rectal balloon and the balloon was filled .",
    "x - rays were taken to locate the diodes .",
    "however , that aspect of the data ( discussed in st ) is not covered in this report , which concerns itself only with what we can learn from diode signals regardless of where each diode is actually located .",
    "three configurations were studied in the following order : 1 ) open field ( of ) , beam on phantom without aperture or range compensator ; 2 ) beam on phantom through aperture and range compensator ( ap+rc ) and 3 ) a solid water phantom ( swp ) . for swp , the diode array was flattened as well as possible .",

    "unlike depth - dose ( dd ) measurements , dose extinction ( de ) measurements are uncommon and their interpretation is not completely obvious . the essential problem can be put this way : suppose we take dd data on an sobp ( flat by design ) as usual , scanning a dosimeter in depth @xmath96 along the beam axis .",
    "we then fix the dosimeter at some @xmath96 and take de data , exposing the water tank to successive range modulated beams of decreasing ranges .",

    "( st puts in the output factor and claims its effect is negligible , but the overall reasoning is not explained . )",

    "we will ignore these issues and analyze de curves as though they were dd measurements .",

    "as expected , the dose rises sooner for of than for ap+rc : there is less material in the beam .",
    "dose onset is deeper and more tightly clustered for ap+rc : the range compensator is doing its job .",

    "the fact that this holds up in the phantom suggests that orientation is not a major issue .",
    "there is strong indication that range mixing can be detected by looking at skewness and kurtosis , but that clearly needs further work .",
    "the present method of fabricating diode arrays needs improvement .",
    "the yield of good channels is too low , shielding is inadequate for some reason , and it is difficult or impossible to repair a bad channel . we should explore packaging each diode separately , shielded and waterproofed , connected to its own shielded twisted pair .",
    "they could then be bench tested and wired in quads to the db9 connectors .",
    "the rectal balloon would be inflated and the diodes affixed with a thin transparent film such as 3 m tegaderm@xmath103 .",
    "we feel this approach should at least be attempted .    about 3feet ( 1 m ) of cable",
    "is required to get the amplifier out of the beam .",
    "noise is proportional to cable capacitance .",
    "the precision of @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is noise limited and less noise means potentially less dose .",
    "we have measured the following pf / foot : hassan adapter cable , 48 ; belden9501 ( ordinary shielded twisted pair ) , 43 ; new england wire technologies ( ne ) n1344b46581 , 27 ; ne n1350b46080 , 19 .",
    "the last named is not only best for capacitance but also the thinnest and most flexible ; it would be easy to get twelve cables out of the rectum as long as they were not tightly bundled .",
    "it costs $ 1632/1000@xmath104 ( minimum order , 10/10/2011 quotation ) or $ 1.63/ft , not particularly expensive .",
    "whoever builds the diode array needs more than a simple digital volt / ohm meter to test the diode and the integrity of the shielding .",
    "one should have at least a single channel current - to - voltage amplifier , a digital scope , and a @xmath105ci radioactive source .",
    "timely bench tests of the full setup will avoid wasted time during the run and suboptimal data .",
    "ultimately it may be possible to locate the iotech6220 in the treatment room , using only short coaxial cables and letting the ethernet connection be the long run to the tcr .",
    "this will undoubtedly work , but leaves the 6220 exposed to neutrons which ( if experience is any guide ) will cause occasional upsets which may or may not be cured by re - booting . in principle",
    "the 6220 can be rebooted remotely using encore , but it is not obvious that will work for an arbitrary upset due to radiation .",
    "we wished to avoid these potential problems , as well as possible permanent damage to the 6220 , during these preliminary tests . in the long run",
    "it should be explored as it would simplify the setup considerably .",
    "having validated the sb method by using de , we do nt need further de experiments just now . the most pressing need is to explore range mixing in a controlled way .",
    "we should first calibrate @xmath0 and the natural functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 using our standard scout beam with a transverse diode array in a water tank . a half - beam ` bone ' slab ( perhaps with a tapered edge ) could then be introduced upstream to introduce range mixing with a known off - axis dependence .",
    "preliminary monte carlo or other theoretical dosimetric studies should be done to ensure that we can produce range mixing of both kinds @xcite : continuous ( where the distal edge is merely broadened ) and bimodal ( where two distal edges are evident ) .",
    "the experiment would use the scout beam alone , and the accuracy of the theoretical prediction could be tested using the measured depth - dose . with good planning",
    "this should take no more than a shift .",
    "after a range mixing experiment , another sb and de measurement in the phantom would be useful as a final test of the technique before attempting a patient . from here on ap+rc is probably sufficient .",
    "the proposed treatment procedure is actually a two - point de measurement .",
    "the sb measurement calibrates the diode sensitivity and provides a range correction , while the subsequent treatment ( during which we will still take data ) measures the dose at the balloon when the correct treatment range is used .",
    "if all is understood , all should hang together , and this should be verified with a mock treatment of a phantom .",
    "somehow , of course , we would have to introduce an ` unkown ' range error to be compensated ; perhaps a small addition to the rc whose water equivalent thickness is unknown to the experimenters .",
