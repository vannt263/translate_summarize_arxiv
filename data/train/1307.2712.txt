    "our aim is to find a point in @xmath7 which we assume to be nonempty .",
    "one classical algorithm is the _ method of alternating projections _ : given a starting point @xmath8 , generate sequences @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the _ projection _ of @xmath11 onto @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are convex , then the projectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 are single - valued and the sequences @xmath3 and @xmath4 converge to some point in @xmath7 .",
    "this classical result goes back to bregman @xcite , and it has found a huge number of extensions ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the general case ,",
    "when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not necessarily convex , the situation is much more delicate . in their 1990 paper @xcite",
    ", combettes and trussell gave quite general sufficient conditions for the following dichotomy : either @xmath3 and @xmath4 converge to a point in @xmath15 or the set of cluster points is a nondegenerate continuum .",

    "may be chosen to be countably infinite unions of closed convex sets .",
    "in contrast , we also prove that the continuum case can not occur when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are finite unions of closed convex sets .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : curve ] , we lay the ground work by studying a certain curve in the euclidean plane . in section  [ s : main ] , we use this curve to construct a sequence of points in the plane that is crucial in obtaining the sets @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "some remarks and the announced positive result conclude the paper .",
    "we will mostly work in the euclidean plane @xmath16 . as usual ,",
    "angles will be measured in radians , but sometimes we shall use degrees as in writing @xmath17 .",
    "let us recall that the distance @xmath18 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , satisfies    @xmath23    hence , @xmath24 define the function @xmath25 by @xmath26 this function will represent the distance of a point on the curve at time @xmath27 to the origin .",
    "clearly , @xmath25 is strictly decreasing with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "also define @xmath30 then @xmath31 and hence @xmath32 is strictly decreasing to @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath34 we now define the curve @xmath35 note that @xmath11 describes a spiral traversing counter - clockwise ; @xmath11 is _ injective _ because @xmath25 is strictly decreasing .",
    "now let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be in @xmath38 , and assume that @xmath39 . by , @xmath40 .",
    "using the definitions , we solve these inequality for @xmath37 and obtain @xmath41 in degrees , this implies @xmath42 . to summarize , @xmath43 we will now discuss the monotonicity of the function @xmath44 because of the triangle inequality ( or since @xmath45 ) , it is clear that @xmath460,\\pi/2\\right [ \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad \\sin(t)+\\cos(t ) > 1.\\ ] ] one checks that @xmath47 where    @xmath48    since each @xmath49 is strictly positive on @xmath500,\\pi/2\\right[$ ] , it follows from the mean value theorem that @xmath51$.   } \\ ] ] combining with , we deduce '' stands for `` there exists a",

    "we now construct a sequence @xmath55 in the euclidean plane with remarkable properties .",
    "let us initialize @xmath56 in cartesian coordinates , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "now suppose @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are given .",
    "in view of , there exists a unique @xmath64 such that @xmath65 we then update @xmath66 ( the picture illustrates the beginning of the spiral and @xmath67 along with the radii used to construct the next iterate . )        we also set @xmath68 by construction , @xmath69 note that @xmath70 because the function @xmath32 is strictly decreasing . set @xmath710,{\\ensuremath{+\\infty}}\\right].\\ ] ] since @xmath25 is strictly decreasing we also note that @xmath72 hence the corresponding sequence of quotients satisfies @xmath73 using and the half - angle identity for sine , we have    [ e:130628f ] @xmath74    dividing by @xmath75 and recalling , we obtain @xmath76 taking limits , we learn that @xmath77 since @xmath78 , in degrees , belongs to @xmath500^\\circ,40^\\circ\\right]$ ] by , we deduce that @xmath79 is convergent as well . if @xmath80 , then @xmath81 by ; however , if @xmath82 , then @xmath83 .",

    "we note that corollary  [ c : main ] is the first example constructed where the set of limit points of alternating projections is a nondegenerate compact continuum .",

    "a more involved analysis shows that if @xmath119 is outside the closed unit disk , then @xmath125 and we are in the second case .",

    "the conclusion of corollary  [ c : main ] hold also true if we replace @xmath53 be the closed unit disk . in this case , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are _ countably infinite _ unions of convex sets . in the following result , we show that a degenerate continuum can not occur as the set of cluster points when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are _ finite _ unions of nonempty closed convex sets .",
    "suppose that @xmath126 and @xmath127 are nonempty finite index sets , let @xmath128 and @xmath129 be families of nonempty closed convex subsets of a euclidean space @xmath6 , and set @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",

    "then there exists a point @xmath135 such that @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "after relabeling and considering the tails of the sequences if necessary , we assume that each @xmath138 and each @xmath139 is projected upon infinitely often .",
    "the pigeonhole principle gives @xmath140 and subsequences @xmath141 and @xmath142 lying in @xmath143 and @xmath144 respectively .",
    "after passing to further subsequences if necessary , we also assume that there is @xmath145 such that @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
