    "soft @xmath0-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are peculiar classes of high energy sources which share a number of properties ( among others , the emission of short bursts , slow rotation periods in a narrow range , secular spin down and a x - ray luminosity of @xmath2@xmath3erg  s@xmath4 , see e.g. woods & thompson 2006 for a recent review ) .",
    "sgrs and axps are believed to be powered by ultra - magnetic neutron stars (  magnetars \" ; duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "spectral analysis is an important tool in magnetar astrophysics since it can provide key information on the emission mechanism(s ) .",
    "the first attempts at modelling the spectra of axps were based on soft x - ray data ( @xmath5  kev ) only .",
    "it was found that a blackbody ( @xmath60.30.6kev ) plus a power - law ( photon index @xmath724 ) or , limited to a few cases , two blackbodies ( @xmath80.1 and @xmath90.8kev ) could successfully model the 0.510kev emission . even though the blackbody plus power - law spectral model has been frequently applied to the x - ray spectra of magnetar candidates , a convincing physical interpretation is still missing ( for the power - law component in particular ) .",
    "recent studies have attempted to overcome this limitation .",
    "thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni ( 2002 ) proposed that magnetars have twisted magnetospheres threaded by currents , which can efficiently boost via resonant cyclotron scattering the soft thermal photons emitted by the star surface .",
    "recent investigations ( lyutikov & gavriil 2006 ; fernandez & thompson 2006 ) showed that such a process may lead to the formation of the power - law tail observed in the soft x - rays .",
    "rea et al .",
    "( 2006 ,  2007 ) presented an application of the lyutikov & gavriil ( 2006 ) resonant cyclotron scattering model ( rcs model in the following ) to sgrs and axps , showing that in a few sources this component alone can explain the x - ray spectrum below @xmath10kev .",
    "more recently , hard x  ray observations have shown that in some magnetar candidates ( namely , , , , , ; kuiper , hermsen & mndez  2004 ; kuiper et al .",
    "2006 ; mereghetti et al . 2005 ; gtz et al .",
    "2006 ) a large fraction of the total flux is emitted at energies well above @xmath11  kev .",
    "the origin of these `` hard '' tails , that have so far been detected up to energies of @xmath12  kev , is still debated ( see beloborodov & thompson 2006 and baring & harding 2006 for possible interpretations ) .    axps and sgrs have been discovered to emit also at optical and/or nir wavelengths ( e.g. hulleman et al .",

    "2004 ; durant & van  kerkwijk 2006b ) .",
    "their optical / nir flux represents a small fraction of the bolometric flux , but still can place important constraints on models .",
    "several axps , have exhibited long term variability both in their optical / infrared emission and in the x - rays ( oosterbroek et al . 1998",
    "; israel et al . 2002 ; hulleman et al . 2004 ; rea et al .",
    "unavoidably this introduces additional uncertainties in the modelling of broad band spectra , based on observations at different wavelengths taken at different times .",

    "all combinations , except for the three models discussed below ( see also fig.1 , 2 , and tab.1 ) , gave unsatisfactory reduced @xmath57 values ( @xmath58 ) .",

    "of course , we found that other models , involving components not listed above ( e.g. a cut - off power - law instead of the hard x - ray power - law ) , gave satisfactory results .",
    "however , in all cases more than 8 free parameters were required .",
    "this is the empirical model which is usually adopted for axp spectra and consists of a single blackbody and two power - laws .",
    "for the best fit gave a blackbody temperature of @xmath59kev , a very steep power - law below @xmath11  kev with @xmath60 , and a flatter power law for the high - energy part of the spectrum , @xmath61 ( see also kuiper et al .",
    "2006 ; den  hartog et al .",
    "we tried also a slightly more general model which includes a cut - off around 300kev in the attempt to make the extrapolation of the canonical model compatible with the existing upper limits above @xmath62  mev ( note that we did not include the mev upper limits in the fit ) .",
    "we found that the quality of the fit did not improve much , despite the addition of one more free parameter in this modelling .",
    "note that the model consisting of two blackbodies plus a power - law did not provide a good fit , mainly because the two blackbodies alone can not account for the soft x - ray part of the emission .",
    "this combination makes use of the rcs model , based on the spectra computed by lyutikov & gavriil ( 2006 ) and recently implemented in xspec by rea et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . as shown by rea et al .",
    "( 2006 ,  2007 ) , this component can explain well the soft x - ray emission of a few magnetars , whereas an additional power - law is required for sources of this class that have a strong hard x - ray emission .",
    "the model parameters , together with the ranges over which each parameter was allowed to vary , are : the velocity of the magnetospheric @xmath63 currents ( in units of @xmath64 ) @xmath65 ; their ( thomson ) scattering optical depth , @xmath66 ; and the temperature of the seed surface emission ( assumed to be a blackbody ) , @xmath67  kev@xmath68  kev .    the efficiency of rcs drops above @xmath10kev , but even in the 610kev energy range the addition of another model component is required to fit the x - ray spectrum of .",
    "we find a best fit of the whole 0.5250  kev spectrum with a rcs plus power - law model with a surface temperature of @xmath69kev , magnetospheric plasma parameters of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and a power law index of @xmath72 .",
    "the rcs component dominates the emission below 6  kev .",
    "the log - parabolic model is an empirical model commonly used to fit blazars spectra , but also successfully applied to a few radio pulsars displaying hard x - ray emission , e.g. the crab and the vela pulsars ( kuiper et al .",
    "2001 ; massaro et al .",
    "2006a , b ) .",
    "we applied this model to our data and found that it fits well the soft and hard x - ray spectrum of ( see also kuiper et al .",
    "log - parabolic spectra ( landau et al .  1986 ) can be obtained when relativistic electrons are accelerated by a statistical acceleration mechanism in which the probability of acceleration depends on energy , and cool via synchrotron losses ( landau et al .",
    "1986 ; massaro et al .",
    "2004 ) or by inverse compton scattering of synchrotron seed photons .",
    "the log - parabolic spectral distribution can be regarded as the simplest generalization of a power - law distribution , as it comprises a mild symmetric spectral curvature .",
    "we adopted the following expression , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the energy in kev , @xmath75 is the photon index at 1  kev energy and @xmath76 controls the curvature of the parabola in a log - log representation . the log - parabola peaks at @xmath77 ; its free parameters , besides the normalization constant @xmath78 , are @xmath75 and @xmath76 or , equivalently , @xmath79 and @xmath76 .",
    "the two log - parabolae we fitted have peaks at @xmath80 1.32 and 412kev , and curvatures of @xmath812.52 and 0.7 .",
    "they provide a very good fit to the data , and have the same number of free parameters as the models discussed above ( see fig .  1 and tab.1 ) .",
    "we have shown that among spectral models with a relatively limited number of free parameters ( @xmath82 ) , only three successfully fit the x - ray spectrum of  ( see  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "the 0.5250  kev fluxes we derived , are consistent among all the three best models .",
    "@xmath14 in the rcs and log - parabolic models is closer to the value measured for this source using x - ray edges in grating spectra ( @xmath83@xmath84 ; see durant & van  kerkwijk 2006a )",
    ".    comparing the extrapolations of these models with the radio , infrared and optical fluxes measured from quasi - simultaneous observations ( durant & van  kerkwijk  2006b , den  hartog et al .",
    "2006 ) , as well as @xmath0-ray upper limits obtained around 0.2  mev by comptel ( kuiper et al .",
    "2006 ) , we found that the canonical model (  3.1 ) overpredicts all of them .",
    "the rcs model (  3.2 ) and the two log - parabolae (  3.3 ) improve over the canonical model since they do not overpredict the low energy emission . in any case , the optical / nir emission of 4u0142 + 614 ( and likely of other magnetar candidates ) accounts for only less than 5% of the overall source luminosity , and might be due to secondary processes as compared to those responsible for the x/@xmath0ray flux .",
    "the optical emission is pulsed , so it is likely to be non - thermal in origin ( kern & martin 2000 ) . on the contrary",
    ", the ir emission can be ascribed to a fossil disk ( see e.g. wang et al .",
    "2006 ) , reprocessing a fraction of the soft / hard x - ray emission of the magnetar .",
    "the two log - parabolae (  3.3 ) are the only model that naturally accounts for the fast decline of the spectrum in the @xmath0-rays , implied by the comptel upper limits .",
    "nevertheless , in the other two models these limits would not be violated if the hard x - ray power law were characterised by a cut - off at @xmath85kev ( though this would require an additional free parameter in the fit ) .",
    "note that in a more detailed physical model the high - energy power law required to fit the integral data may quickly decline around @xmath85  kev , e.g. as a result of the maximum energy up to which the spectrum of the emitting particles extends .",
    "thompson & belobodorov ( 2005 ) recently proposed that the hard x - ray magnetar emission may be attributed to bremsstrahlung photons emitted by a thin surface layer heated up to @xmath86  kev by returning currents .",
    "however , we find that the  spectrum is harder at high energies than envisaged this scenario ( fig.2 ) .",
    "a bremsstrahlung model seems hardly compatible with the hard x - ray spectrum of this source and the comptel upper limits .",
    "although two log  parabolic functions are often used to model a synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) emission , in the case at hand this interpretation appears unlikely for several reasons .",
    "first , it is difficult to reconcile the soft part of the x - ray spectrum with synchrotron emission , since the low energy log - parabola has a curvature @xmath87 which translates in a curvature of @xmath88 for the e@xmath89 spectrum .",
    "this is very close to the cut - off curvature of the high energy synchrotron emission of a single particle .",
    "moreover , we performed detailed simulations ( see tramacere 2002 ; tramacere & tosti 2003 for details ) in order to infer which local magnetic field and electron density is needed to power the emission by a ssc mechanism .",
    "we obtained @xmath90 g and @xmath91@xmath92 , respectively .",
    "a charge density of the same order is predicted in the simple twisted magnetosphere model by thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni ( 2002 ) , but close to the neutron star surface .",
    "instead , the low value of the magnetic field requires that such e@xmath89 are located at an altitude of several hundred kms in the magnetosphere .",
    "we may speculate that inverse compton scattering by a population of relativistic particles high up in the magnetosphere may explain the hard x  ray emission of magnetars , for other ( than synchrotron ) spectral distributions of seed photons , e.g. that produced by the rcs model .",
    "interestingly , the presence of highly relativistic particles well above the star surface has been also suggested by thompson & beloborodov ( 2005 ) .",
    "these authors pointed out that seed positrons injected at @xmath86  km above the surface can undergo runaway acceleration and upscatter x - ray photons above the threshold for pair production . in their model ,",
    "the @xmath93 pairs would then be responsible for efficient synchrotron emission in the 20 - 200 kev band .    in this letter we introduced and fitted spectral models , as purely empirical laws .",
    "as in many other studies where the total emission of x  ray pulsars is modelled , no attempt was made to fit separately the spectral behaviour of the pulsed and the non  pulsed components . a more extensive study based on data of other magnetar candidates and attempting a more detailed physical interpretation of these results is in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
