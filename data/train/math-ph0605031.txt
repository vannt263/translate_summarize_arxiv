    "the torus gives rise to the quantization condition  : the corresponding phase is obtained ( to first order ) by integrating the canonical one - form @xmath155 along this torus .",
    "the fact that this corresponds to a resonance rather than to a eigenvalue is due to the fact that the iso - energy curve has components leading to infinity .",

    ", one can show that such a phase does not give rise to eigenvalues .",
    "the presence of these components leading to infinity in the @xmath7-direction gives rise to resonances .",

    "in  @xcite and  @xcite , we have developed a new asymptotic method to study solutions to an adiabatically perturbed periodic schrdinger equation i.e. , to study solutions of the equation @xmath156 in the limit @xmath157 .",
