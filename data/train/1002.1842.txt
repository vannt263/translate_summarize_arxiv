    "the model introduced originally by glauber @xcite is defined on a one dimensional lattice where a one - spin - flip markovian stochastic process takes place .",
    "it simulates the dynamics of a ferromagnetic ising chain with first - neighbor interaction , and the stationary state is described by the gibbs measure associated with the ising hamiltonian as a consequence of obeying detailed balance . in stationary regime at non - zero temperatures , the two - time functions like the autocorrelation and response function , are time - translationally invariant and connected through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ; furthermore , the model displays a transient where aging is observed @xcite . at zero temperature , when the system becomes critical , the fluctuation - dissipation ratio ( which is related to the effective temperature of the system@xcite ) assumes a nontrivial value @xmath2 .    when the model is extended to higher dimensions , and called glauber model , no analytical solution is available due to the nonlinear structure of the transition rate .",
    "nevertheless , the linearized version of the glauber model , proposed a few years ago @xcite , can be treated by analytical tools in any dimension .",
    "the linear glauber model can be seen as the voter model with noise , which displays a disordered ( paramagnetic ) phase only ; in the absence of noise , however , the system becomes critical .",
    "the dynamics of linear glauber model was investigated by some of the authors in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "this model is microscopically irreversible , that is , it does not obey detailed balance in the stationary state , for dimension @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , it has both the stationary and aging regimes , with a nontrivial fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath2 in the later regime as in the usual one - dimensional glauber case .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation relation was usually conceived for systems that obey detailed balance @xcite , and has been generalized to include non - stationary regimes by the introduction of an effective temperature measuring the violation of fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "many works have confirmed this phenomenon for several models @xcite .",
    "recent progress has suggested that it can also be invoked for nonequilibrium models @xcite , which does not have an associated known hamiltonian ( see also this issue in the context of kinetically constrained models@xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation relations were analyzed in a general class of models that exhibit up - down symmetry which does not obey detailed balance .",
    "the above mentioned works are closely related to the question of universality in out - of - equilibrium processes @xcite . in equilibrium statistical mechanics , it is widely known that the critical behaviour of a system is governed by the fixed point of the renormalization transformation , and it turns out that only a few characteristics of the model are relevant to determine its universality class .    in out - of - equilibrium dynamics ,",
    "some of the problems related to universality may be addressed by the generalized version of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the response function and autocorrelation , respectively ( see @xcite for some recent results ) .",
    "the typical experimental situation under consideration is a quench from a completely disordered state , which in reversible systems corresponds to a high temperature state , to the critical point .",
    "the usual fluctuation - dissipation relation is verified when the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath7 equals the unity .",
    "it was conjectured that @xmath7 would depend functionally on @xmath6 only @xcite , but renormalization group analysis @xcite and numerical calculations @xcite indicated that the fluctuation - dissipation ratio is a function of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , scaling arguments were casted to propose the asymptotic behaviour for the autocorrelation and response function @xcite at the critical temperature .",
    "this result suggested that the quantity @xmath9 is universal due to its dependence to dynamical exponents and the ratio of autocorrelation and response amplitudes , which are conjectured to be universal @xcite .    in this paper , we introduce and analyze a nonequilibrium lattice model , which is a generalization of the nonequilibrium linear glauber model to more than two states , which we call linear @xmath0-state model .",
    "the model can be understood as the linearized version of the dynamics associated to the equilibrium @xmath0-state potts model .",
    "the dynamics of the model , as is the case of any dynamics of the potts model , is invariant under the permutation of any two states .",
    "the model can also be understood as a @xmath0-state voter model with noise . in this interpretation ,",
    "a group of individuals are called to vote in one of @xmath0 candidates",
    ". a voter changes his opinion by choosing randomly a neighbor individual and adopting the neighbor s opinion with probability @xmath10 and remaining with his opinion with probability @xmath11 , the noise . without noise",
    ", it reduces to the ordinary @xmath0-state voter model @xcite . similarly to the linear glauber model , the present linear @xmath0-state model displays a paramagnetic phase whenever @xmath12 and becomes critical at @xmath13 .",
    "the analysis of such model has two main aims .",
    "first , it addresses the question raised in a previous result @xcite about the dynamical phenomena of aging and violation of fluctuation - dissipation for a class of systems that does not obey detailed balance  recall that these problems were usually studied through models that are described by a hamiltonian .",
    "finally , there is an additional interest in considering a model with a more general symmetry in order to verify its influence on the ( possibly ) universal quantity cited above , since in equilibrium statistical physics , symmetry plays a major role in the critical behaviour .",
    "the equilibrium potts model with @xmath0 states has been used to describe experimentally systems that display a number of identical states or structures at low temperatures @xcite such as the adsorption of noble gases on graphite @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to describe biological cell sorting @xcite . the nonequilibrium model with many equivalent states such as",
    "the one studied here may be relevant in the description of systems where microscopic reversibility is not ensured like some biological phenomena@xcite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section [ qstate ] ,",
    "the nonequilibrium linear @xmath0-state model is defined and many one - time functions are determined analytically the two - time functions are calculated in section [ cr ] , where the fluctuation - dissipation relations are carefully examined , and some dynamical exponents are calculated in section [ dynamicalexponents ] .",
