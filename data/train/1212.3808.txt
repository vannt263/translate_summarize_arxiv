    "a large number of solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments provide solid pieces of evidence for the neutrino oscillation phenomenon , and hence for nonzero neutrino masses and mixing  @xcite .",
    "most of these experimental results can be understood by oscillations of the three so - called _ active _ neutrinos , which appear in charged- and neutral - current weak interactions in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a global fit  @xcite to the three - neutrino oscillation data gives their best - fit mass - squared differences of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , there are a few experimental results , most notably the lsnd anomaly  @xcite and more recently the miniboone results  @xcite , as well as the reactor anti - neutrino anomaly  @xcite , which can not be explained within this three - neutrino - mixing paradigm and seem to require additional neutrino(s ) with mass - squared differences of order 1 ev@xmath2 .",
    "such additional neutrinos can not couple directly to the sm @xmath3-boson , due to the lep constraint on its invisible decay width  @xcite which allows only three active light neutrinos .",
    "hence , these neutrinos must be _ sterile _ neutrinos  @xcite , i.e.  sm gauge singlets , and can only participate in the sm weak interactions through their mixing with the active neutrinos .    in the light of recent predictions of a slightly higher reactor anti - neutrino flux  @xcite , a global analysis of the short baseline ( sbl ) neutrino oscillation data favours the existence of more than one light sterile neutrino in the ev mass range  .",
    "on the other hand , cosmological data also indicate a weak preference for additional light degrees of freedom : @xmath4  @xcite , which could be interpreted as another evidence for sterile neutrinos in the ev / sub - ev mass range  @xcite .",
    "the existence of light sterile neutrinos requires further theoretical justification , since unlike the active neutrinos , the sterile neutrino masses are not protected by the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "there are a number of interesting proposals in the literature  @xcite to explain the lightness of the sterile neutrinos in various extensions of the sm , for nonzero active neutrino masses @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 ) . in the simplest extension which realizes the type - i seesaw mechanism  @xcite , @xmath7 right - handed neutrinos @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 )",
    "are added to the sm some of which could in principle play the role of light sterile neutrinos , provided their masses are in the ev range  @xcite .",
    "the masses and mixing of the active and sterile neutrinos can be deduced from the @xmath10 complex symmetric neutrino mass matrix in the flavour basis @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix , and @xmath14 is the @xmath15-breaking majorana mass matrix of the singlet neutrinos . in the usual seesaw approximation @xmath16 , with @xmath17 being the norm of the matrix @xmath18 , the light neutrino masses are determined from the mass matrix @xmath19 with mass eigenvalues @xmath20 , whereas the heavier masses are roughly the eigenvalues of @xmath14 : @xmath21 . in this case , the active - sterile mixing , given by @xmath22 , is very small , thus limiting our ability to observe the singlet neutrinos , unless @xmath23 ev which are mostly excluded over a wide range by the present data  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine a theoretical framework yielding simultaneously light sterile neutrinos as favoured by the sbl neutrino oscillation data and a sizable active - sterile mixing to be observable in the current or near future experiments .",
    "an attractive possibility is the so - called inverse seesaw model  @xcite , where in addition to the right - handed neutrinos as in the type - i seesaw model , another set of sm singlet fermions @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 ) is introduced . in this case , the mass matrix in  ( [ eq : mnutype1 ] ) gets extended to the following @xmath26 general mass matrix in the basis @xmath27 : @xmath28 where in addition to the usual dirac mass matrix @xmath13 and the majorana mass matrix @xmath29 in the @xmath30@xmath31 sector , we have added another dirac mass matrix @xmath32 and majorana mass matrix @xmath33 in the @xmath31@xmath34 singlet sector .",
    "observe that the standard inverse seesaw model discussed originally in  @xcite is recovered , once we set the right - handed neutrino majorana mass @xmath35 in  ( [ eq : inverse1 ] ) . in this case , for @xmath36 , it is possible to have very light sterile neutrinos , e.g. in the presence of a @xmath37 symmetry  @xcite or in theories with warped extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "another interesting realization of inverse seesaw models arises , when @xmath38 , but @xmath39  -fields are forbidden due to specific flavour symmetries  @xcite . ] . in this case",
    ", the rank of the mass matrix given by  ( [ eq : inverse1 ] ) reduces to @xmath40 , and the light neutrinos are _ exactly _ massless at the tree level .",
    "however , they acquire a small mass at the one - loop level which is _ directly _ proportional to the majorana mass matrix @xmath29  @xcite and results from well - known sm radiative corrections involving the @xmath3- and higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "this scenario , called the minimal radiative inverse seesaw model ( mrism ) in  @xcite , is very economical , as it does not require the existence of other non - standard scalar or gauge fields or other fermionic matter beyond the singlet neutrinos  @xmath41 .    in this paper",
    ", we study the possibility of having light sterile neutrinos in the mrism with three pairs of singlet neutrinos @xmath42 ( for @xmath43 ) . in the limit @xmath44 , after integrating out the three heavy singlet states @xmath45 with masses of order @xmath46 , we are left with six light mass states . of these six light states , three should describe the mostly active neutrinos and the remaining three will be mostly sterile states . in particular , we discuss two benchmark scenarios . in the first scenario ,",
    "all the sterile neutrinos are heavier than the active ones , with two of them having mass in the ev - range ( as in the 3 + 2 models ) to explain the lsnd+miniboone+reactor data , while the remaining one is in the kev - range to account for the dark matter ( dm ) in the universe  @xcite . in the second scenario ,",
    "one of the sterile neutrinos is in the kev - range as in the first scenario , and the second one is in the ev - range ( as in the 3 + 1 models ) , while the third sterile neutrino is _ superlight _ and almost mass - degenerate with the electron neutrino @xmath47 .",
    "we present numerical estimates of the model parameters for both of these benchmark scenarios .",
    "finally , we also comment on another possibility discussed in the literature when all the three sterile states are in the ev - range ( the 3 + 3 models ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ] , we briefly review the mrism and present the effective neutrino mass matrix after integrating out the heavy sterile states . in section  [ simple ] , we analyze the simple case of one single flavour , for illustration purposes . in section  [ general ] , we generalize our analysis to the three flavour case and discuss the experimental constraints on the mixing parameters . in section  [ benchmark ] , we present our results for the benchmark scenarios mentioned above .",

    ", the mass matrix in  ( [ eq : block - meff ] ) needs to be further diagonalized into a fully mass - diagonal form . before doing so for the general three - flavour scenario in section  [ general ]",
    ", we will first consider a simple one - flavour scenario for illustration purposes , which would help us to gain valuable insight .",
    "in this case , we replace all the matrices in  ( [ eq : m1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : m2 ] ) by complex numbers . then , the mass eigenvalues are simply given by @xmath80 while the mass eigenvectors are given by @xmath81 from  ( [ eq : eigvec ] ) , we note that in the limit @xmath82 , the massless state is mostly the active neutrino @xmath83 , whereas in the limit @xmath84 , the massless state is mostly the sterile neutrino @xmath85 .",

    "we minimize the function defined in  ( [ eq : f ] ) while simultaneously requiring that the elements @xmath198 for @xmath150 fall within the allowed range of @xmath199 given in  ( [ eq : vp ] ) .",
    "in addition , we require that the element @xmath200 should be within @xmath201 , as discussed above . for @xmath176 , our results are shown in fig .",

    "it was shown in  @xcite that this scenario has the highest compatibility between the neutrino and anti - neutrino data sets , but still has a poor compatibility between the appearance and disappearance data sets .",
    "they obtained the following best - fit values for the experimentally relevant 12 parameters in the ( 3 + 3)-case : @xmath207 for the parametrization of the unitary matrix discussed in appendix a , this yields @xmath208 thus , we find that the three experimentally relevant dirac @xmath112 phases for the ( 3 + 3 ) scenario are _ not _ independent of each other , and only two of them are independent , as already noted in  @xcite .",
    "hence , we can not obtain a solution for the phases in  ( [ eq:3 + 3 g ] ) satisfying the values given in  ( [ eq:3 + 3gvp ] ) , which were presumably obtained by assuming that they are independent parameters .",
    "note that it is also very difficult to make the ( 3 + 3)-scenario with the best - fit @xmath209 values given by ( [ eq:3 + 3gvp ] ) compatible with a standard cosmological model .",
    "we have discussed the possibility of having light and superlight sterile neutrinos in the recently proposed minimal radiative inverse seesaw model . in the limit @xmath44 , after integrating out the heavy singlet states with masses of order @xmath46 , we are left with three light sterile neutrinos along with the three usual active neutrinos .",
    "we have considered two benchmark scenarios for the mass hierarchy of these light sterile states . in the first scenario , denoted as the ( 3 + 2 + 1)-scenario , one of the light sterile states has mass in the kev - range and very small mixing with the active neutrinos to account for the dark matter in the universe , whilst the other two sterile states are in the ev - range with non - zero mixing with the active states , as required to explain the lsnd+miniboone+reactor neutrino data .    in this article , we have also discussed another potentially interesting scenario , denoted as the ( 4 + 1 + 1)-scenario , with one superlight sterile neutrino state almost degenerate in mass with the solar neutrinos , within the context of the minimal radiative inverse seesaw model .",
    "this superlight sterile neutrino may mix weakly with both solar and atmospheric neutrinos and might give rise to observable effects in the current and future neutrino data .",
    "such superlight sterile neutrinos may also provide an explanation for the extra radiation observed in the universe .",
    "moreover , this scenario is more compatible with the cosmological constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses .",
    "finally , we note that both of these scenarios discussed here constitute _",
    "complete _ extensions of the standard model for neutrino masses and dark matter , while being consistent with all the existing data .",
    "in addition , the heavy singlet neutrinos in this model with a degenerate mass spectrum could be used to explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe , through the mechanism of resonant leptogenesis .",
