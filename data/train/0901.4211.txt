    "micro - rna ( mirna ) belongs to a class of small non - coding single stranded rna , approximately 21 nucleotides long , which negatively regulate gene expressions .",
    "mature mirna interacts with the @xmath6 untranslated regions ( @xmath6 utr ) of the gene in human and down regulate the expression of the target either by degrading the mrna or inhibiting the translation . in some cases , increased expressions of the target gene by mirnas have also been reported ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) .",
    "recent experiments show , at least in few specific cases , that the mature mirna can alters the expressions of the genes by binding to the coding regions as well as @xmath7 utr of genes [ 2 - 4 ] providing further complex regulation of the genes by mirnas .",
    "it has been proposed on the basis of theoretical analysis that as many as 30% of genes in the human genome may be the target of mirna [ 5 ] .",
    "recent , estimates predict that as large as 90% human genes are targets of mirna [ 6 ] . however , experimental validation of such prediction is largely lacking",
    ". function of each region of the mature mirna is not well defined , although , the seed region ( 2@xmath8 to 7@xmath9 position from the @xmath7 end of the mature mirna ) , is the most important region that interacts with @xmath6 utr for regulation of the target genes .",
    "the other regions known as extended seed and delta seed regions also contribute to the target selection [ 7 ] . the diversity and abundance of mirna targets offer an enormous level of combinatorial possibilities and suggest that mirnas and their targets appear to form a complex regulatory network .",
    "functions of mirna is known only for some , although deregulation of mirnas has been shown in number of diseases like various types of cancers [ 8 , reviewed in 9 ] cardiovascular development and heart failure [ 10 ] .",
    "involvement of mirnas in various diseases has been recently reviewed [ 11 ] .",
    "studies of various diseases and normal cellular processes indicate that mirnas are involved in immune - system [ 12 ] ; stem cell renewal and development [ 13 , 14 ] . using inhibitors of different mirnas",
    "it has also been shown that several mirnas are involved in cell death , cell growth and proliferation [ 15 ] .",
    "the extent of modulation of the targets and their influences on the biological processes that lead to alteration of cellular phenotype varies considerably [ 16 ] . in a recent study in caenorhabiditis elegans ( c. elegans ) where",
    "@xmath10 of the c. elegans mirna ( total @xmath11 mirna ) are mutated and effects of these mutant genes are studied .",
    "it is shown that majority of mirna mutations do not result into any phenotypic changes , indicating that there are redundancies of mirnas that can target a gene .",
    "however , @xmath12 of mirna deletion causes clear developmental and morphological defects .",
    "it has been proposed that there is significant functional redundancy among mirnas or among gene pathways regulated by mirnas [ 17 ] . in spite of considerable information on the involvement of mirna in numerous biological processes and large number of human diseases ,",
    "the precise information of the targets they regulate in the normal processes and diseases remains elusive .",
    "role of mirnas in signal transduction pathway has been identified in a recent work . by analyzing the interactions between mirnas and a human cellular signaling network , it has been observed that mirnas specifically target positive regulatory motifs , downstream network components and the highly connected scaffolds in a signaling network and genes whose promoter regions include a large number of putative transcription factor(tf ) binding sites [ 18 ] .",
    "combinatorial regulation of genes by tf and mirnas provides higher complex programs [ 19 ] .",
    "however , it is not known fully how mirna - mirna interactions regulates the expressions of the genes .",
    "interactions of mirna - mirna and mirna - tf in regulating the expressions of protein coding genes have recently been studied .",
    "two databases namely target scan and pictar have been used that cataloged @xmath13 predicted targets of @xmath14 mirna and @xmath15 predicted targets of 178 mirna respectively .",
    "there are overlaps ( @xmath16 ) in the mirna lists and targets covered in these two databases [ 20 ] .",
    "abilities of three mirna namely mir-16 , mir-34a , mir-106b to alter cell cycle , target expressions and apoptosis have been studied .",
    "it has been observed that mir-16 and mir-34a together block g1 to s transition greater than that obtained individually but lesser than additive . on the contrary ,",
    "expression of mir-106b , which accelerates g1 to s transition , together with mir-16 or mir-34a , reduce the cells in g1 less than that obtained with mir-16 or mir-34a alone but higher that obtained with mir-106b alone .",
    "this result shows that mir-16 and mir-34a together exhibit an intermediate cellular phenotype .",
    "all these mirnas alter specific sets of the targets .",
    "thus different mirna may target the different proteins in the same pathways [ 21 ] .",
    "experimental evidence also has been provided recently to show that specific pairs of mirnas together involves in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells [ 22 ] .",
    "it is important to know whether mirnas interact in a combinatorial fashion , alters specific biological pathway(s ) and participates in human diseases .    in the present communication , using 711 mirna in human and their predicted targets we have performed a topological analysis of mirna network to elucidate how mirna - mirna interactions regulate the targets .",
    "we observe that the mirna are clustered and that some clusters of mirna co - target the genes in the specific pathways .",
    "analysis of published experimental data describing deregulated mirna and mrna in 15 diseases , support this notion .",
    "for the analysis of mirna and their targets in human , we use the mirbase database , ( http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/ ) which has @xmath17 micrornas ( mirnas ) and @xmath18 gene targets .",
    "first , a data set is created where the gene versus the set of mirnas targeting that particular gene is listed row - wise . a schematic representation of the data set as a bi - partite network is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the blue and red circles there represent the mirnas and the genes respectively . for convenience , both mirnas and genes",
    "are given arbitrary identification number @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively . a line ( or link ) is drawn between micro rna @xmath21 and a gene @xmath22 , if @xmath21 targets @xmath22 . in total",
    "there are @xmath23 links which connect the mirnas and their targets . from the figure it is evident that the system of mirna - gene form a bi - partite network represented by a @xmath24 adjacency matrix @xmath25 with matrix elements , @xmath26        * figure 1 : * figure shows a schematic representation of the bipartite connections of mirnas and their targets .",
    "the network is bi - partite , because there is no link between two elements within the group of genes or mirnas , i.e. two genes or two mirnas are never connected . in figure 2a , we have shown the distribution of targets ( genes ) @xmath27 , which is the fraction of genes ( shown as circles in figure 1 ) targeted by @xmath28 number of mirnas . if the connections had been random ( i.e. , if @xmath23 links were distributed among @xmath0 mirnas randomly ) we would have obtained a normal distribution ( blue solid line in figure 2a ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath27 varies significantly from what is expected from a random bi - partite graph .",
    "@xmath27 could be fitted to an exponential distribution ( shown in the inset of figure 2a ) with a a typical scale @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that , most of the genes are targeted by only @xmath30 mirnas .",
    "only a few genes are targeted by a large number ( @xmath31 ) of mirnas which are termed as the target _ hubs_. the degree distribution , being different from a random normal graph , implies that there is a high organizational structure in the gene - mirna interaction network .",
    "similar organizational structure is observed from the distribution of mirnas @xmath32 , which is the fraction of mirnas that target @xmath33 number of genes .",
    "we find that @xmath34 mirna in the mirna hub target @xmath35 genes ( data not shown ) .",
    "* figure 2a : * distribution of targets @xmath36 , which is fraction of genes targeted by @xmath33 mirnas ( red circles ) is compared with a random network ( blue lines ) . the same plot is shown in the inset in semi - logarithmic scale .",
    "analysis of the genes in the target _ hub _ ( total @xmath2 , suplimentary table s1a ) by panther revealed that genes with molecular functions like nucleotide binding , transcription factor , receptor and hydrolase are enriched compared with the genes in the human genome .",
    "genes involved in biological process like apoptosis , cell cycle , developmental process , nucleic acid metabolism , signal transduction etc .",
    "are significantly over represented among the genes in the target hub .",
    "genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation , cell structure and motility and oncogenesis are also significantly decreased .",
    "genes in the target hub are enriched in specific pathways like p53 pathway , angiogenesis , in two neurodegenerative disease pathways namely alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease pathway .",
    "representative result of pathways enrichment is shown in the figure 2b and the full analysis is shown in the supplementary table @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "results shown in supplementary table @xmath37 to @xmath38 and in the figure 2b indicate that mirna in combination may alter molecular functions , biological processes and cellular pathways .",
    "this result is similar to that have been obtained with lesser number of mirna ( about @xmath39 ) that target approximately @xmath40 genes [ 20 ] .        *",
    "figure 2b : * comparisons of various pathways in the human genome and among the genes in the target hubs .",
    "representative pathways are shown where the genes in specific pathways are significantly enriched ( filled bars ) in comparison with that obtained in the human genome ( open bars ) using panther .",
    "to probe the detailed structure of the network , we create a co - target network of mirna - mirna as follows : if two mirna co - target @xmath41 ( non - zero ) number of genes , we define that these mirnas are linked .",
    "the weight of the link is @xmath41 .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath42 , no connection is made between these mirnas . by doing so , we form an undirected weighted network of mirnas .",
    "the corresponding adjacent matrix @xmath43 is symmetric having elements @xmath44 , where @xmath44 is the number of genes co - targeted by mirna @xmath21 and @xmath22 . @xmath45",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath46 , are not well defined .",
    "we take @xmath47 .",
    "schematic description of this network is shown in the figure 2c .",
    "few properties of this co - target network can be checked easily .",
    "first , it is a `` fully connected network '' , which does not have any sub - graph .",
    "the distribution of weights @xmath48 is shown in figure 2d , which is again compared with corresponding random graph .",
    "the result indicates that the connections are not random and the network is highly organized .",
    "again we find that there is a huge difference between the maximum wight @xmath49 and the minimum @xmath50 , which leads to a conjecture that most links might be irrelevant and can be erased .",
    "next , we describe how to get an optimal set of mirnas , by erasing irrelevant links , which could still describe all essential features of the co - target network .",
    "we define that the weak links are those whose weights are smaller than a pre - decided cutoff @xmath51 , and erase them .",
    "( for example when @xmath52 , links between @xmath53 and @xmath54 in figure 2c are to be erased . )",
    "the network do not remain fully connected anymore and breaks up into smaller disconnected sub - graphs .",
    "let the number of these disconnected sub graphs be @xmath55 , which explicitly depends on @xmath51 .",
    "the largest among these subgraphs , named as g , is the _ important _ sub - graph .",
    "clearly size of g decreases with increase of @xmath51 .",
    "for very large @xmath51 , g has only fewer mirnas ; that might simply the study of this network at the cost that some of the functionalities which are lost .",
    "thus we need to optimize @xmath51 such that all irrelevant links are erased , keeping only the optimal set of mirnas in g which are functionally relevent .",
    "note , that the cut - off @xmath51 redefines a new adjacency matrix @xmath56 thus , the number of subgraphs @xmath55 is the number of diagonal blocks of @xmath57 , which can be found by block - diagonalizing the matrix @xmath57 . since it is a fully connected graph , initially @xmath58 and then @xmath55 increases with q. figure 2d shows a plot of @xmath55 versus @xmath51 .",
    "it is evident from figure 2d that there are three regimes , ( a ) @xmath59 , ( b ) @xmath60 and ( c ) @xmath61 .",
    "almost all the connections are present in regime ( a ) . in this regime",
    "the connections are quite _ stiff _ and the network does not break up until a threshold @xmath62 is reached . by increasing @xmath51 one goes to regime ( b ) where the irrelevant connections are already erased and only the relevant connections are present .",
    "thus any little change in @xmath51 changes @xmath55 substantially .",
    "the relevant mirnas , which cooperatively regulate the expressions of the genes to form the co - target network are probably found in regime ( b ) . in regime ( c ) , @xmath51 is very large to erase even the relevant connections .",
    "only connections which are present in this regime ( c ) are possibly due to chemical similarity , @xmath63 , the mirnas form very small subgroups and _ seed _ sequences ( position @xmath64 to @xmath65 in the mature mirna ) of mirnas within a subgroup are identical .",
    "this proposition has been verified as follows : we take @xmath66 and find all the disconnected sub - graphs which have two or more mirnas .",
    "the seed sequence of mirnas in every sub - group has been checked .",
    "we find that the set of mirnas in each subgroup ( except only one of 63 subgroups ) have identical seed region [ see supplementary table s2 ] .",
    "* figure 2c : * representation of the mirna network . here mirnas ( 1 to 711 ) are shown in blue circles . in this example",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 , which says that mirna 1 and 4 co - target 17 genes whereas mirna 2 and 3 do not have any common target .",
    "note that the continuous break - up transition is a distinct property of mirna co - target network , it does not occur for a random graph as shown in figure 2d ( blue line ) .",
    "to emphasize this point further let us construct a random undirected graph @xmath69 which has total weight @xmath70 is same as that of @xmath43 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 effectively , we need to choose @xmath73 random integers , one for each upper diagonal element of @xmath43 ( total @xmath74 ) so that their sum is @xmath70 .",
    "since the random matrix @xmath69 has to be symmetric ( @xmath75 ) , the lower diagonal elements can be calculated by substituting @xmath76 by @xmath77 . in a similar way , by varying the cut - off @xmath51 we find @xmath55 for @xmath69 , which is shown in figure 2d ( as blue dashed line ) .",
    "note that the break up of the random network into subgraphs in this case occurs discontinuously , unlike the mirna co - target network .",
    "this result indicates that mirna co - target network is structurally rich .",
    "details topological structure of the network are now being studied .",
    "the analysis reveals that the optimally connected graph ( the sub - graph having maximum number of relevant mirna nodes ) which still posses the properties of the network can be found if we work at @xmath78 . to find @xmath79 ,",
    "we differentiate @xmath51 numerically with respect to @xmath51 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath80 ( as shown in the figure 2d ) corresponds to @xmath81 . in this case , at @xmath81 , @xmath82 and the largest connected sub graph @xmath83 is found to contain only @xmath5 nodes ( for full list of mirnas in 166 sub graphs see the supplementary table s3 ) .",
    "thus , these nodes or mirnas form the optimal set of mirna which co - regulate the gene expressions . to determined how mirnas are organized within the sub graph @xmath83",
    ", we increase the cutoff @xmath51 beyond @xmath79 and follow how @xmath83 as breaks up into smaller clusters of mirnas . _ clusters _ in this context are defined as the subgraph which has more than one mirnas .",
    "it is expected from figure 2d that number of such clusters would not change much once we reach region ( c ) where @xmath84 which starts approximately at @xmath85 .",
    "thus , we take @xmath86 and collect the _ clusters _ ( the sub graphs of @xmath87 which have two or more mirnas ) .",
    "there are in total 70 such clusters containing 330 mirnas .",
    "thus it is reasonable to assume that the mirnas within @xmath83 are organized as 70 clusters , 169 independent mirnas and interactions between them .",
    "these clusters form the basic units of the mirna interaction network .",
    "figure 3 shows the interaction network of mirna of @xmath88 clusters . in the present study , we clustered the mirnas on the basis of their ability to co - target the same genes , however , such co - targeting could be due to similarity in the seed sequences .",
    "we checked that 18 out of @xmath88 clusters might be due to seed similarity .",
    "about @xmath89 of the mirna in human are organized within 10 kb of genomic sequence . whether organizationally clustered mirnas are under same regulatory sequence and expressed together remains unknown .",
    "eleven out of @xmath88 clusters might be due to the genomic organization(supplementary table s4 ) .",
    "we extended our analysis to study mirna - mirna interaction networks in caenorhabditis elegans with @xmath90 mirnas and their @xmath91 targets ( http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/targets/v5/genome.pl ) .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath51 in this network is @xmath92 .",
    "the largest connected sub graph at @xmath62 contains @xmath93 mirnas .",
    "most surprisingly , we find that both the species show universal features near the breakdown transition , similar to that shown for human in figure 2d ( data not shown ) .",
    "reasons for such similarity in break down of mirna - mirna interaction network require further studies .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the clusters of mirnas form a interaction network through their common targets ( shown in figure 3 and discussed in section 4.4 ) .",
    "biological significance of this network in under investigation .        * figure 2d : * ( a ) number of disconnected sub - graphs @xmath55 when links with weight @xmath94 are erased .",
    "( b ) corresponds to the same , for a random network .",
    "plot of @xmath80 ( which is scaled by a factor @xmath95 for better visibility ) shows a peak at @xmath81 .",
    "we need to know the biological relevance of the mirna clusters better as they form the basic units of biological interactions for the regulation of the targets .",
    "the smallest cluster in subgraph @xmath87 , of course , contains two mirnas , while the largest cluster contains @xmath96 mirnas ( supplementary table s4 ) . to explore whether the mirnas in clusters target genes in specific pathways we determine if the co - targeted genes in a mirna cluster is involved in any specific pathway . to do so , we determine the common targets of the mirnas in a cluster taking two mirna at a time , and then asked whether the co - targeted genes are enriched for a particular pathway(s ) compared to the targets which are not co - targeted by the mirna in that cluster .",
    "for example , there are three mirnas in cluster no .",
    "@xmath97 ( supplementary table s4 ) , namely mir-603 , mir-521 and mir-523 , which do not have common seed sequence and in combination [ mir-603 and mir-521 ( @xmath98 ) and mir-521 and mir-523 ( @xmath99 ) and mir-523 and mir-603 ( @xmath100 ) ] target @xmath101 genes [ ( @xmath102 ) ] .",
    "these three mirnas together target @xmath103 genes .",
    "the number of genes not targeted by the mirnas in this cluster is @xmath104 .",
    "using the panther , we observed that common targeted genes ( @xmath101 ) are significantly ( @xmath105 ) enriched in axon guidance mediated by semamorphins ( p00007 ) , cell cycle ( p00013 ) , dna replication ( p00017 ) and fgf signaling ( p00021 ) pathways .",
    "this analysis further reveals that out of @xmath88 clusters , co - targeted genes in @xmath96 clusters are significantly enriched at least one biological pathway ( total biological pathways in human at panther database is @xmath106 ) . in several cases ,",
    "the co - targeted genes are over represented in more than one pathway ( supplementary table s4 ) .",
    "significant enhancement of the genes co - targeted by the mirnas in a cluster indicate that these clustered mirnas regulate genes in specific pathway .",
    "* figure 3 : * interaction network of @xmath88 clusters containing 330 mirnas ( links with weight @xmath107 are erased ) .",
    "alterations of several mirnas have been observed experimentally in about eighty diseases [ 25 ] .",
    "to probe whether the clustered mirnas obtained above are associated with any disease , we retrieved data from published papers , where deregulated mirnas in diseases are reported .",
    "we collected data for 15 diseases where deregulation of mirnas are reported ( supplementary table s5 , see supplementary text for the references ) .",
    "these diseases include autism ( number of deregulated mirna 31 ) , schizophrenia ( 22 ) , diabetes ( glucose homeostasis ) ( 19 ) , ovarian cancer ( 54 ) , aml ( 38 ) , breast cancer ( 28 ) , colon cancer ( 19 ) , lung cancer ( 39 ) , pancreas cancer ( 56 ) , prostate cancer ( 48 ) , stomach cancer ( 25 ) , hnc ( 59 ) , thyroid cancer ( 51 ) , cll ( 53 ) and glioblastoma ( 11 ) ( supplementary table s5 ) .",
    "we note that total number of mirnas studied in these reports are not available for all the cases , making it difficult to assign the mirnas which are not changed in these diseases . among the altered mirnas , number of mirnas in the largest cluster g ( 479 mirna ) with q=103 , and in the 70 clusters ( s ) derived from the g with @xmath86 is shown in the table i. it is evident from the table that for some diseases , the numbers of mirnas in g are significantly higher than one expects from random distributions of the mirnas in clusters . for example , in prostate cancer , 48 mirnas are deregulated , out of which 41 mirnas belong to the cluster g ( 479 mirna ) .",

    "thus , in combination , the level of expression of target genes of mirna might reduce further the gene expression compared to that could be obtained with a single mirna .",
    "combinational regulation of target genes by mirnas might be complicated by the location of the target sites at @xmath6 utr as well as the tissue specific expressions of the mirnas .",
    "there are overlapping or very closely spaced mirna target sites for a particular target gene .",
