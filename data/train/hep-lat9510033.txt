    "the @xmath5 meson decay constant is an experimentally important quantity that can be calculated within the present techniques of lattice qcd .",
    "the calculations , however , would be hampered by a number of systematic effects and problems , which do not appear in the calculation for light quarks .",
    "we have been carrying out a set of quenched simulations covering the range of inverse lattice spacing @xmath6 gev employing the wilson quark action to investigate systematic errors in the calculation . in particular , our prime aim is to see the effect of scaling violations in the decay constant associated with heavy quarks of @xmath7 , which allows various definitions of meson mass , and to examine whether the results continue to the static value at the infinite quark mass limit . in this article",
    "we report results obtained so far at @xmath0 and 6.3 using vpp500/80 at kek .",
    "in table  [ lat_par ] we summarize parameters of our runs .",
    "the analyses reported in this article is based on data sets , the statistics of which are doubled since the time of the symposium .",
    "we choose the spatial lattice size so that the physical lattice size is kept approximately constant at @xmath8fm , which should be reasonably large to avoid finite - size effects for analyses of heavy - light meson properties .",
    "the temporal lattice size are taken large in order to ensure a reliable extraction of the ground state .",
    "gauge configurations are generated with the 5-hit pseudoheatbath algorithm separated by 2000 sweeps for @xmath0 and 5000 for @xmath2 .",
    "we take seven values of the heavy quark hopping parameter @xmath9 to cover the mass of charm and bottom quarks .",
    "four values of light quark hopping parameter @xmath10 are employed for an extrapolation to the chiral limit . in the heavy - light sector",
    "we calculate meson propagators for an arbitrary combination of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "light hadron propagators are evaluated only for the degenerate case .",
    "quark propagators are obtained with the red / black minimal residual algorithm for the point and wall sources in the coulomb gauge , and local operators are used for sink .    for @xmath11 fitting of hadron propagators",
    "we employ a single exponential uncorrelated fit with a single elimination jackknife analysis to estimate errors of masses and amplitudes .",
    "for the fitting interval @xmath12 $ ] , we take [ 14,26 ] at @xmath4=6.1 and [ 16,32 ] at @xmath2 .",
    "these are chosen by the conditions that the point and wall source results for effective mass overlap at @xmath13 , and that @xmath14 should be as large as possible until errors become unacceptably large and the fit becomes unstable .",

    "@xcite .",
    "we also list in table  [ lat_par ] our results for the pion decay constant @xmath32 using the physical scale as estimated above . for the renormalization factor",
    "we employ the tadpole improved one - loop result@xcite @xmath33 which equals 0.750 at @xmath4=6.1 and 0.772 at @xmath4=6.3 .",
    "we observe that the value of @xmath32 is two standard deviations smaller than the physical value at @xmath4=6.1 in contrast with the case of @xmath4=6.3 where they are consistent .",
    "finally the qcd @xmath34 parameter @xmath24 estimated from the tadpole - improved @xmath35 coupling constant indicates the presence of a small violation of asymptotic scaling in this quantity , as has been known from previous work@xcite .",
    "a manifestation of @xmath36 effects for the wilson quark action appears in the discrepancy of the pole mass @xmath37 and the kinetic mass @xmath38 defined by an expansion of energy of the form , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and the constant @xmath41 parametrizes relativistic corrections .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that dynamical scales of heavy - light mesons are controlled by the kinetic mass , and hence it is a physically more relevant mass parameter than the pole mass .",
    "we adopt this view and examine the mass dependence of the decay constant in terms of the kinetic mass .",
    "= 7.0 cm    in fig .",
    "[ mpole_mkin ] we illustrate our data for the two masses .",
    "the kinetic mass is extracted by a fit of the measured dispersion relation using four values of momenta up to @xmath42 in terms of ( [ nr_dispersion ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the relation of the two masses are reasonably described by the form @xmath43 which follows from the dispersion relation for a free scalar particle given by @xmath44@xcite .",
    "the relation , however , is not accurate in the region of charmed meson .",
    "= 7.0 cm    our method to obtain the lattice value of the heavy - light decay constant is summarized by @xmath45 the first two factors represent the non - relativistic normalization for the quark wave function@xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath46 is extracted from the relation , @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 at time @xmath50 are the local axial - vector and pseudoscalar currents , the subscript @xmath51 at time @xmath52 denotes the type of source , and the hyperbolic tangent takes into account the change of sign of the numerator at half the temporal lattice size @xmath53 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath54 is defined in terms of the point - to - point pseudoscalar propagator through @xmath55    = 7.0 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig_effm_heavy - light_a ] we plot a typical example of the ratio of propagators in ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "data for the ratio for the wall source exhibits a smooth behavior with small errors of 1% or less for any value of the hopping parameter we took .",
    "thus the constant @xmath46 can be reliably determined .    for an extraction of the amplitude @xmath54 we employed a single hyperbolic cosine fit to the point - to - point pseudoscalar propagator at the time of the symposium .",
    "we observed that this is problematical when the heavy quark hopping parameter becomes small because of a rapid increase of fluctuations .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_effm_heavy - light_b ] which shows the effective mass of the heavy - light meson at our smallest value of @xmath9 : no clear signal of plateau can be seen for the point - to - point propagator ( open circles ) .",
    "an alternative procedure , facilitated by the fact that signals are much better for the wall source , is to apply a simultaneous fit to the point - to - point and point - to - wall propagators assuming a common mass .",
    "we find that the fit becomes much more stable and that the fitted value of @xmath54 over subsets of configurations fluctuates much less .",
    "we therefore adopt this procedure to extract the value of @xmath54 .",
    "an example of the fitted value and the error for mass is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_effm_heavy - light_b ] ( solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "at @xmath2 we may compare our results for lattice value of @xmath56 with those of ref .",
    "applying the same analysis procedure as ours to their data we find that the two sets of results are consistent within the error .",
    "= 7.0 cm    we employ the tadpole - improved one - loop renormalization factor @xmath57 , already encountered for @xmath32 , to convert lattice results for @xmath58 to those in the continuum .",
    "since this factor refers to the case of zero quark mass , an uncertainty of @xmath59 remains in our final result . in fig .",
    "[ fig_fsqrtm ] we plot the scale invariant quantity @xmath60 as a function of the inverse of meson mass @xmath61 for both @xmath4=6.1 and 6.3 , where we take the measured kinetic mass for @xmath62 .",

    "@xcite for comparison .",
    "conversion to physical units is made with the lattice spacing listed in table  [ lat_par ] .",
    "we observe that the results at the two values of @xmath4 agree with each other , and they seem to continue smoothly to the static value .",
    "errors in the kinetic mass and statistical fluctuations arising from point - to - point propagators in the values for @xmath63 , however , are still large to tell conclusively whether large @xmath7 effects are absent for the heavy - light meson decay constant .",
    "we remark that this result is obtained when @xmath63 is plotted with respect to the measured kinetic mass .",
