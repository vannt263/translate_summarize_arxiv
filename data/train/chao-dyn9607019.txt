    "in the past several years a large body of research has focused on the problem of relating the macroscopic behavior of non - equilibrium systems to the underlying chaotic dynamics of the particles of which the system is composed .",
    "some macroscopic transport coefficients appearing in hydrodynamic - like equations have been related to microscopic quantities which characterize the chaotic properties of the system @xcite .",
    "ruelle , sinai , and bowen @xcite introduced a powerful method to derive most of the interesting chaotic properties of a given system from a free - energy type function , called the ruelle or topological pressure .",
    "this _ thermodynamic formalism _ is based on a partition function calculated in a dynamical phase space . for systems governed by discrete , rather than continuous dynamics , one point in the dynamical phase space over @xmath11 time steps",
    "consists of a trajectory , @xmath12 , which is a set of @xmath11 successive states of the system .",
    "the topological pressure @xmath0 is defined as the infinite time limit of the logarithm of the partition function divided by the time @xmath11 , in a way similar to the definition of the free - energy per particle in a canonical ensemble , in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "again , in analogy with the methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics , there is an inverse temperature  like parameter @xmath1 which allows one to scan the structure of the probability distribution for @xmath13 .",
    "this formalism has been successfully applied to lorentz gases @xcite .",
    "these are models in which independent light particles are moving among fixed scatterers .",
    "they can be considered as elementary models for diffusive transport in fluids and solids . in the continuous case ,",
    "the effects of disorder in the configuration of scatterers can be taken into account and chaotic properties can be computed in the region of @xmath14 , as will be discussed in another paper @xcite .",
    "the model can be simplified further by constraining the light particles to move on a regular lattice , and placing scatterers , with some density , at random locations on the sites of this lattice .",
    "such models are called lorentz lattice gases ( llg s ) . for some of these we already calculated the ruelle pressure around @xmath3 in the framework of a mean - field approximation @xcite . for one - dimensional open systems on a lattice of size",
    "@xmath4 we obtained the escape rate @xmath15 , the lyapunov exponent @xmath16 , and the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy , and found good agreement with independent direct numerical estimates of the same quantities @xcite .",
    "all these quantities depend on the average density of scatterers @xmath17 .",
    "we have previously reported @xcite that , for @xmath1 different from unity , and for systems with static disorder , the ruelle pressure has unexpected properties as @xmath4 becomes large enough . in particular , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath18 ,",
    "it becomes independent of the density of scatterers .",
    "the cause of this is that , for large systems , the ruelle pressure is completely determined by rare localized fluctuations in the configuration of scatterers .",
    "this peculiar behavior is expected to be general for all diffusive systems with static disorder , in any dimension . in this paper",
    "we develop the _ analytical _ arguments allowing for such a claim .",
    "the numerical counterpart will be presented in a separate paper @xcite .    in the next sections we first describe the llg model in more detail , and",
    "then introduce the thermodynamic formalism .",
    "moreover , we will extend the results of @xcite to a mixed random walk model , and use it throughout the paper to illustrate the generality of our results .",
    "the main line of our calculation is to construct exact upper and lower bounds for the ruelle pressure which , as we will show , coincide in the thermodynamic limit , and are determined by rare configurations of scatterers , except in a small region about @xmath19 .",
    "we refer to this situation as localization of orbits on rare fluctuations of disorder .",
    "this means that the dominant contributions to the ruelle pressure in the limit of large systems originate from orbits ( points in the dynamical phase space ) where the particle is restricted to move on those rare fluctuations , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath20 , on the largest compact cluster of scatterers , and for @xmath21 on the largest hole .",
    "we need , as a side result , the distribution function of the largest cluster size over all configurations , and the crude estimate of @xcite will be refined .",
    "the analysis of finite size effects shows that the thermodynamic limit is approached extremely slowly , @xmath22 where @xmath6 depends on the model and on the sign of @xmath7 . for finite systems ,",
    "we have estimated the @xmath1range around @xmath19 in which the ruelle pressure is still determined by trajectories extending over the whole system . as @xmath1 is deviating more and more from unity ,",
    "the orbits become more and more localized on the largest cluster or in the largest hole of the entire configuration . in one dimension",
    ", there is an intermediate state with `` weak '' localization ( see section 7 ) .",
    "the extension to continuous lorentz gases is presented in section 8 .",
    "a ` light ' particle moves ballistically in a finite simple cubic domain @xmath23 having periodic or absorbing boundaries and containing @xmath24 sites of a @xmath25-dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "the allowed states of the system @xmath26 at time @xmath11 ( @xmath27 ) are specified by the position @xmath28 and the velocity @xmath29 of the moving particle .",
    "the set of possible velocities @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) connects each site to its @xmath31 nearest neighbors , where the coordination number @xmath31 equals @xmath32 for a simple hypercubic lattice .",
    "a fraction @xmath17 of the sites  chosen at random  is occupied by a scatterer or ` heavy ' particle .",
    "the quenched configuration of scatterers is specified by the set of boolean variables @xmath33 , where @xmath34 if site @xmath35 is occupied by a scatterer , and @xmath36 if site @xmath35 is empty .",
    "when the light particle hits a scatterer , it is scattered to one of the lattice directions with a probability that depends on its incident velocity .",
    "the scattering laws are further specified by introducing a transmission coefficient @xmath37 , a reflection coefficient @xmath38 , and , for hypercubic lattices , a deflection coefficient @xmath39 , normalized as @xmath40 more formally , @xmath41 with @xmath42 is the probability that the moving particle with incident velocity @xmath43 is scattered to the outgoing velocity @xmath29 with normalization @xmath44 .",
    "for instance , on a square lattice , the transition matrix has the form @xmath45    the scattering at site @xmath35 is described by the random transition matrix @xmath46 which depends on the configuration of scatterers @xmath47 , and is given by @xmath48 at full coverage @xmath49 the moving particle performs a random walk with correlated jumps , referred to as the persistent random walk ( prw ) @xcite .    the time evolution of this system , in a fixed configuration of scatterers ,",
    "is described by the chapman ",
    "kolmogorov equation for the probability @xmath50 , with @xmath26 , to find the moving particle at time @xmath11 on site @xmath35 with incident velocity @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath51 in the case of absorbing boundary conditions , boundary states @xmath52 referring to a particle entering the domain @xmath23 are excluded from the @xmath53summation .",
    "the transition matrix @xmath54 represents the probability to go from state @xmath55 to state @xmath26 , and is given by @xmath56    the basic ideas of this paper are applicable to the much wider class of diffusive models with static disorder , such as hopping models with bond or site disorder @xcite , as well as to continuous lorentz gases ( see section 8) . as the most immediate generalization of a llg",
    ", we consider another model of a random walk , called a mixed random walk ( mrw ) , in which a particle moves on a lattice filled by a random mixture of x types of scatterers .",
    "this model may be described by x scattering matrices of the form of eq.([a2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath57 with parameters @xmath58 ( @xmath59 x ) .",
    "the model contains the ` ballistic ' llg , described above , as the special case with x = 2 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "the scattering at site @xmath35 in the mrw - model is then described by the random transition matrix @xmath63 where @xmath64 if site @xmath35 is occupied by a scatterer of type @xmath65 , and zero otherwise .",
    "boundary conditions may be either periodic ( closed system ) or absorbing ( open system ) on the boundaries of domain @xmath23 , and the transition matrix satisfies the normalization relations @xmath66 the inequality sign in eq.([a7 ] ) for _ open _ systems refers to the case where @xmath67 denotes a state at a boundary site @xmath35 with non  entering velocity ( boundary states with entering velocity do not occur ) .",
    "indeed , the sum over @xmath68 excludes states where the particle has escaped from the domain @xmath23 .",
    "hence the probability for remaining inside the domain decreases when the particle finds itself on a boundary site .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the starting point for this paper is a partition function defined in the dynamic phase space whose points @xmath69 represent trajectories of @xmath11 time steps : @xmath70 ^\\beta , \\label{defz}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the probability that the system follows a trajectory @xmath12 , starting from @xmath72 at @xmath73 in a given system of linear dimension @xmath74 .",
    "the temperature - like parameter @xmath75 allows us to scan the structure of the probability distribution @xmath76 , where large positive and negative @xmath1-values select respectively the most probable and most improbable trajectories @xcite .",
    "the concepts used in this section have been discussed in great detail in ref.@xcite .    in each specific system",
    "the probability @xmath77 for a given trajectory can be expressed in terms of the transition probabilities @xmath54 : @xmath78 the partition function is determined by the properties of the matrix @xmath79^\\beta$ ] , which is defined by raising each matrix element @xmath54 to the power @xmath1 . for large times the partition function for almost all systems becomes independent of the initial point @xmath72 ( ergodicity , see @xcite ) , and is determined by the largest positive eigenvalue @xmath80 of the matrix @xmath81 , which for ergodic systems can be shown to be non  degenerate .",
    "there is a slight complication because hypercubic lattices are bipartite , i.e. the moving particle is always on even sites at even times and on odd sites at odd times , or vice versa .",
    "the system therefore consists of two independent ergodic components , which should be considered separately , and the matrix @xmath81 is called a periodic matrix of period two @xcite . to avoid these complications",
    "one may consider the time @xmath11 to be an even integer multiple of the time step and then consider the matrix @xmath82 , defined between even or between odd sites only , to be the fundamental matrix .",
    "again , the largest eigenvalue @xmath83 ^ 2 $ ] of the matrix @xmath84 , restricted to one sublattice , is non  degenerate .",
    "in addition , the topological or ruelle pressure is defined as @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes an average over all configurations generated by the prescription that for each lattice site , independently , @xmath17 is the probability that it will be occupied by a scatterer .",
    "the topological pressure is independent of @xmath72 , if the system is ergodic , and can be expressed in terms of the largest eigenvalue , @xmath87 , of the matrix @xmath88 as @xmath89 where we have taken the infinite time limit inside the configurational average .",
    "several chaotic quantities can be derived from this function @xcite .",
    "for example : the sum of all _ positive _ lyapunov exponents is @xmath90 ; the escape rate for open systems is @xmath91 ; the kolmogorov - sinai entropy follows from the generalization of pesin s theorem to @xmath92 ; the topological entropy @xmath93 satisfies @xmath94 ; the hausdorff dimension @xmath95 of the repeller ( the set of trajectories that never escape ) for an open system is the zero  point of the ruelle pressure , i.e. @xmath96 .",
    "a prime in the above formulas denotes a @xmath1-derivative .",
    "in this section the ruelle pressure will be calculated in the limit of infinite system size , by constructing upper and lower bounds at finite @xmath4 and analyzing their limiting behavior for large @xmath4 .",
    "consider first the _ lorentz lattice gas_. for a _ closed _ system it follows from the definition of @xmath97 and eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) that @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 for _ open _ systems the equality sign in eq.([c1 ] ) is replaced by a ` less than ' sign in case @xmath53 is a boundary state . as a general upper bound , valid for both open and closed systems ,",
    "we obtain @xmath101 if @xmath102 , this implies that @xmath103 everywhere , as @xmath104 .",
    "this inequality combined with eqs.([defz ] ) and ( [ prodp ] ) yields : @xmath105 then the pressure , defined by eq.([a10 ] ) , satisfies the inequality : @xmath106 if @xmath107 , and consequently @xmath108 , the analog of eq.([c4 ] ) becomes : @xmath109 and @xmath110 the above equations , ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) , provide upper bounds for the ruelle pressure for all @xmath1values .    to construct a lower bound to @xmath111 we consider clusters of scatterers , i.e. regions where every site is occupied by a scatterer , and select the cluster of largest size @xmath112 .",
    "a cluster is said to have _ size _",
    "@xmath112 , if the largest inscribed cube , oriented along the lattice directions , has a linear dimension @xmath112 .",
    "if there are several largest clusters of the same size , just choose one arbitrarily .",
    "the value of @xmath112 is well defined for any given configuration of scatterers .    as all terms in the sum ( [ defz ] )",
    "are non  negative , any sum over a subset of trajectories will give an exact lower bound for @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath113 denote the sum over all trajectories which remain confined for @xmath11 time steps to the largest inscribed cube of size @xmath112 ( again , if for a given cluster there is more than one inscribed cube of linear size @xmath112 , choose one arbitrarily ) , then we have a lower bound : @xmath114 in fact , @xmath115 is equal to the partition function of a prw in an open hypercubic domain with @xmath116 sites . according to eq.([a11 ] ) this requires the largest eigenvalue @xmath117 of the matrix @xmath118 for the prw , which can be found in ref.@xcite , and reads for sufficiently large @xmath112-values : @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 here @xmath65 is the smallest wave number accessible to the system , i.e. @xmath122 for a closed system ( with periodic boundaries ) and @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) for an open hypercube ( with absorbing boundaries ) .",
    "on the basis of eqs .",
    "( [ a11 ] ) and ( [ lowerzrw ] ) we find the first lower bound on the ruelle pressure , valid for all @xmath1values : @xmath125 if we can show that the moment @xmath126 tends to zero when the system size increases , then this lower bound will tend to the upper bound ( [ up1 ] ) in the range @xmath102 . in the range",
    "@xmath21 , this lower bound will approach the finite negative value @xmath127 .",
    "we need another lower bound which will tend to the upper bound ( [ up2 ] ) for @xmath128 . in order to find it , we consider for any fixed configuration the longest line segment free of scatterers .",
    "contrary to the largest cluster defined above , the largest empty line segment is always a one - dimensional domain , whatever the dimensionality of the system is .",
    "let @xmath129 be the number of empty sites on this line segment , and @xmath130 the partition sum ( [ defz ] ) restricted to trajectories confined to this line segment .",
    "in fact , we keep only a single trajectory , which travels continually through the empty region and is reflected by the two scatterers at the end sites . for sufficiently large times",
    "the number of reflections is approximately @xmath131 .",
    "the resulting sum is @xmath132 and we have thus a second lower bound for the ruelle pressure , valid for all @xmath1values , @xmath133 in summary , the following upper and lower bounds apply to all llg s : @xmath134 the above bounds can be extended straightforwardly to the mixed random walk ( mrw ) models , where eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) becomes @xmath135 with @xmath136 , and @xmath137 defined in a similar way as in eq.([c2 ] ) .",
    "the lower bounds @xmath138 and @xmath139 are respectively determined by the largest cube of @xmath140-scatterers containing @xmath116 scatterers , where @xmath140 is the type of scatterers for which @xmath141 is largest for a given @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting upper and lower bounds in mrw - models can then be summarized as : @xmath142 the bounds for @xmath102 contain the llg as a special case ; the bounds for @xmath128 are different .",
    "the goal of this section is to show that the upper bounds of section [ sect_upper ] are indeed the asymptotic values for the ruelle pressure in the limit of infinite systems ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "to do so , we need to evaluate the inverse moments , @xmath144 @xmath145 , entering in eq.([c8c ] ) , in the limit as @xmath143 .",
    "this requires the asymptotic behavior of the probability that the largest cluster is of size @xmath112 .",
    "we first consider the _ one - dimensional _ case where configurations are generated by distributing scatterers on the lattice sites according to the prescription that the occupation probability for each lattice site is @xmath17 , independently of the other sites .",
    "then the total number of scatterers @xmath146 may fluctuate around its average value @xmath147 . a crude estimate can be obtained by noticing that the average number of clusters of size @xmath148 is approximately @xmath149 .",
    "indeed the cluster can be centered on @xmath4 different positions on the lattice ( or @xmath150 positions for an open system ) , it contains @xmath148 scatterers , and is bordered by two empty sites . for @xmath148 to be a typical value for the size of the largest cluster , the above expression must be of order unity , which implies that @xmath112 scales as @xmath151 . for the inverse moments of @xmath112 this implies @xmath152 for large @xmath4 . hence upper and lower bounds in eqs.([c8c ] )",
    "approach the same limit .",
    "this argument can be extended directly to higher dimensions .",
    "a cluster of size @xmath148 ( this means that the largest inscribed cube has side @xmath148 ) occurs roughly @xmath153 times , where we used that for large @xmath148 the probability of finding at least one empty site in each of the boundary hyperplanes is very close to unity . for @xmath4",
    "sufficiently large @xmath154 is of order unity if @xmath155 .",
    "consequently the inverse moments @xmath156 for @xmath143 .",
    "the @xmath4dependence of the inverse moments can be obtained more rigorously by the following observation .",
    "we identify the clusters of size @xmath148 , with @xmath157 , as ` noninteracting molecules ' of _ species _ @xmath148 with partial densities + @xmath158 .",
    "the probability to find a volume of size @xmath24 unoccupied by clusters of size @xmath159 is then @xmath160   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sim &   \\exp \\left [ -l^d \\rho^{m^d } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we replaced the sum in the exponential by the first term , since the size of subsequent terms in the series decreases extremely rapidly .",
    "we also replaced @xmath161 by @xmath112 , which will induce some correction terms of relative order @xmath162 in the final expression ( [ d5 ] ) .",
    "the probability that the largest cluster is exactly of size @xmath112 is then @xmath163 , or in the continuum limit , @xmath164 for large @xmath4 the inverse moments @xmath165 can be evaluated asymptotically by a saddle point method , as @xmath166 is sharply peaked around its maximum .",
    "the maximum is located at @xmath167 , which is the root of : @xmath168^\\prime = - d l^d ( \\ln \\rho ) m^{d-1 } \\rho^{m^d } + d   \\ln ( \\rho ) m^{d-1 } + ( d-1 ) m^{-1}.\\ ] ] for large @xmath112 the solution of this equation is determined by the first two terms on the right hand side ( dominant balance argument ) , yielding , @xmath169 with correction terms of relative order @xmath162 . for large @xmath4",
    "the inverse moments behave asymptotically as , @xmath170 in agreement with the crude estimate above .    in the preceding paragraphs",
    "the probability @xmath17 of occupation of sites by scatterers has been kept fixed .",
    "it can be shown that the results ( [ d5 ] ) and ( [ d6 ] ) for the @xmath4 dependence are still correct if one fixes the total number of scatterers , @xmath146 , in all configurations @xcite .",
    "the above results can also be used to estimate the typical size @xmath129 of the largest empty line segment .",
    "the distributions for scatterers and holes are symmetric by exchange of @xmath17 and @xmath171 .",
    "as we are interested in a one - dimensional domain , whatever the dimension @xmath25 of the lattice , we have to replace @xmath116 by @xmath129 .",
    "we straightforwardly obtain @xmath172 we conclude therefore that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath143 , the moments @xmath144 vanish and thus the lower bounds of section [ sect_upper ] converge towards the @xmath4independent upper bounds .",
    "this yields for the ruelle pressure in llg s in the thermodynamic limit @xmath173 in the mrw - models , the ruelle pressure is @xmath174 as is illustrated in figure [ figpsilimit ] for mrw models .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the dynamic partition function and the ruelle pressure of llg s in thermodynamically large systems are completely determined by the rare fluctuations in the spatial distribution of scatterers .",
    "it is worth stressing again here that for the regions @xmath175 , and @xmath21 , and @xmath176 , different sets of trajectories make the dominant contributions to the ruelle pressure . for @xmath177",
    "the trajectories contributing to the partition function in a given configuration of scatterers are localized on the largest compact cluster of scatterers , i.e. localized in the ` most chaotic ' or ` least deterministic ' region . for @xmath21 only a single trajectory contributes , which  on any @xmath25dimensional lattice  is localized on the longest line segment that is free of scatterers , i.e. the relevant trajectory is localized in the ` least chaotic ' or ` most deterministic ' region of configuration space    therefore , as @xmath178 the ruelle pressure becomes independent of the configuration ( except for atypical configurations such as strictly periodic ones ) ; it is even independent of the density of scatterers ( except at @xmath179 , where no fluctuations exist any more ) . it does not carry any information on the structure of the random medium",
    "since for @xmath1 different from unity , relevant trajectories do not explore the whole system but only a small part of it , the ` mean field configuration ' with all scatterers more or less equidistant from one another is not at all a typical configuration . on the contrary , it is the one that gives , among all configurations , the minimal value for the ruelle pressure . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximal ruelle pressure is obtained for the configuration where all of the scatterers form a single compact cluster .",
    "the average will be somewhere in between .",
    "this means that any calculation starting from a mean field approximation will give very poor results for @xmath1-values different from unity @xcite .",
    "however at @xmath19 , the ruelle pressure for the llg and its derivatives with respect to @xmath1 do depend on the overall density @xcite and on more details of the total configuration of scatterers@xcite . for _ finite _ @xmath4 ,",
    "this is also true in a small region around @xmath3 .",
    "there , relevant trajectories are extended or delocalized , and explore large regions of the lattice .",
    "this conclusion is based on the reasonably good agreement for escape rates and lyapunov exponents between the results from computer simulations and mean field calculations for the llg @xcite .",
    "the same conclusions carry over to the mrw - models , where in the thermodynamic limit the trajectories are localized on the largest compact cluster with @xmath180scatterers . at @xmath3 ,",
    "all scatterers have the same @xmath181 and again trajectories are delocalized on the whole lattice .",
    "the structure of the typical mean field configurations , contributing around @xmath182 , has not yet been explored , and mean field estimates for the lyapunov exponents in open systems have not yet been derived for mrw s .",
    "interesting new phenomena can occur near those values of @xmath183 where different types of scatterers may have the same value of @xmath184 .",
    "for example , this occurs at @xmath185 if all scatterers have the same number of non  zero  scattering directions .",
    "then the moving particle can not distinguish between the different types of scatterers and the relevant trajectories become again  delocalized \" on a large cluster with a random mixture of the different scatterers with the same value of @xmath186 .",
    "more explicitly , if there are x types of scatterers , it may occur that @xmath187 ( @xmath188x ) of them have the same @xmath189 strictly greater than the @xmath184 for all other types of scatterers",
    ". then the cluster of @xmath140scatterers on which the relevant trajectories are localized contains a random mixture of these @xmath187 types of scatterers @xcite .",
    "suppose now that we consider , for @xmath190 , a llg or a mrw model that shows a percolation transition .",
    "in such a case is important to note that the definition for the cluster size used here is not the number of connected sites , but the size of the largest inscribed hypercube , which typically is much smaller than the system size even for a percolating cluster .",
    "thus the percolation transitions in such models have no effect on our considerations and the results of this paper remain valid .",
    "in this section we estimate the size of the delocalization region around @xmath3 in llg s for finite systems .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of the repeller ( i.e. the set of trajectories which do not escape from the system after an infinite time ) is a root of the ruelle pressure , @xmath191 for a large system , @xmath95 is close to unity @xcite . using the facts that @xmath192 for a hypercubic domain in @xmath25dimensions , where @xmath193 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath194 where @xmath195 represents the sum of positive lyapunov exponents in the infinite @xmath4limit , we find that the hausdorff dimension @xmath95 for a large hypercubic domain is in first approximation , @xmath196 where @xmath193 and @xmath195 depend on the density of scatterers .",
    "therefore , as the structure of the repeller is a fundamental feature of the system , the crossover region should extend at least over a @xmath1range of order @xmath197 .",
    "on the other hand we have concluded that for @xmath198 and for @xmath1 different from unity , the ruelle pressure becomes independent of the global structure of the disorder , as the relevant trajectories become localized in regions of the lattice where rare fluctuations of high or low density of scatterers occur .",
    "this was demonstrated in previous sections in the limit of infinite systems .",
    "therefore as long as the mean field value of the ruelle pressure or of the largest eigenvalue is smaller than the lower bound , the states of the system are localized .",
    "in fact , numerical results @xcite support our intuition that the effect of localization can be estimated fairly well for any large but finite system by taking the lower bounds in eqs .",
    "( [ c8c ] ) as estimates of the ruelle pressure for @xmath102 or @xmath199 .",
    "hence , for a given @xmath4 crossover from localized to extended states occurs as we approach @xmath19 from either side , when the mean field value equals the lower bound .    to obtain an estimate of these crossover values",
    ", we compare the ruelle pressure of the mean field configuration with the estimate for the ruelle pressure based on the lower bounds ( see eq .",
    "( [ c7 ] ) ) .",
    "it is equivalent to compare the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath88 associated with a localized and with a delocalized eigenstate .",
    "the second one is obtained for the ` mean ",
    "field ' configuration in llg s from the prw expression ( [ c5 ] ) by a rescaling argument @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath200 with @xmath201 and @xmath202 defined in eqs.([c2 ] ) and ( [ c6 ] )",
    ".    for @xmath102 localization takes certainly place if the lower bound on the ruelle pressure is larger than the mean field value , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath203 where the left hand side is the lower bound given in eq .",

    "the right hand side is the mean field value given by eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) . by expanding both sides in powers of @xmath205",
    ", we find that the ruelle pressure is determined by localized trajectories only if @xmath206^{2/d } , \\label{ineq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath207 .",

    ", the crossover between localized and delocalized states may involve some intermediate states . in principle",
    "one might have a `` weak localization '' in a region of size @xmath209 ( with @xmath210 ) , where the local density , @xmath211 , is slightly larger than @xmath17 , but where @xmath212 is large enough so that trajectories , remaining confined to this region , dominate the ruelle pressure . to estimate the largest density fluctuation to be found in a region of size @xmath209 we first note that the probability for a density fluctuation @xmath212 in such a region can be estimated as @xmath213 , with @xmath214 the chemical potential of the scatterers ( considered as lattice gas particles ) .",
    "since the number of different regions of this size is on the order of @xmath2 for @xmath209 in the above range , the largest density fluctuation occurring in one of these regions follows from the requirement @xmath215 , or @xmath216 in a manner similar to ( [ loc_beta_small ] ) we compare the mean field value @xmath217 with the mean field estimate of the ruelle pressure corresponding to trajectories confined in a region of average density @xmath218 , @xmath219^{\\rho + \\delta \\rho } \\left [ 1-\\delta(\\beta ) \\frac { d \\pi^2}{(\\rho + \\delta \\rho ) m_1 ^ 2 } \\right ] \\right\\}. \\nonumber\\ ] ] expressing @xmath212 in terms of @xmath209 according to ( [ deltarho ] ) and expanding the difference @xmath220 to lowest order in @xmath221 yields a condition for  weak localization \" in the most dense region of size @xmath209 , namely , @xmath222 by taking the estimate of the delocalization region in ( [ ineq1 ] ) one immediately sees that for @xmath223 , this inequality can only be satisfied in @xmath10 .",
    "localization will occur on a region of size @xmath224 maximizing the difference ( [ ruellediff ] ) in ruelle pressures .",
    "differentiating ( [ ruellediff ] ) with respect to @xmath209 gives an @xmath209 that is proportional to @xmath225 .",
    "as long as this is @xmath226 , weak localization will occur .",
    "as soon as @xmath227 the confinement region of the dominant trajectories becomes comparable to the full system and weak localization is no longer a meaningful concept .",
    "hence , in one dimension one can distinguish in addition the weak localization regime @xmath228 .",
    "the region of full delocalization is narrowed down to @xmath229 .    for @xmath128 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the crossover value can be determined by comparing the mean field estimate with the lower bound ( [ c8 ] ) for the ruelle pressure in the llg , combined with eq .",
    "( [ d6 ] ) , i.e. @xmath230 by expanding in powers of @xmath231 we find localization for @xmath232 for @xmath10 one can show again , by using arguments similar to those above , that there is a region of weak localization where the density is slightly lower than average .",
    "this region occurs for @xmath1 values given by @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is a positive constant .    in summary ,",
    "the ruelle pressure in llg models is determined by extended or delocalized states if @xmath1 is in the interval @xmath235 @xmath236 , for @xmath237 , and in the interval @xmath238 for @xmath239 , where @xmath240 , and @xmath234 are some positive constants .",
    "our considerations can be extended to the case of continuous lorentz gases with static disorder . for @xmath20 ,",
    "we expect the moving particle to be localized in a region of space with a high density of scatterers , while for @xmath128 it should be localized in a large region where the density of scatterers is zero . to provide some qualitative explanations of this observation , we consider a lorentz gas with hard spherical scatterers , the so  called non overlapping lorentz gas .",
    "extension to overlapping scatterers or soft scatterers is possible but will not be considered here . in the non - overlapping lorentz gas and @xmath177 the ruelle pressure approaches in the thermodynamic limit that of a closely packed system of hard spheres of diameter @xmath241 . to understand this it suffices to bound the dynamical partition function by the contribution of all trajectories confined to a hypercubic volume of size @xmath116 , containing the centers of @xmath242 scatterers .",
    "the probability of finding such a volume in the system can be estimated conservatively to be at least proportional to @xmath243 by expanding the logarithm of the ratio of configurational partition functions in powers of the volume @xmath116 of the hypercube ( using @xmath244 )  as the hypercube is a small subsystem of the total system with @xmath245  and noting on the other hand that the partition function @xmath246 of the hypercube increases exponentially in @xmath116 , we conclude that the probability in ( [ probavoid ] ) is proportional to @xmath247 with @xmath6 some constant .    for any average density below the close - packing density",
    "this can be made of order unity by choosing @xmath116 proportional to @xmath248 , which implies that for increasing @xmath249 arbitrarily large volumes with a density arbitrarily close to the close - packing density can be found .",
    "it is not clear what happens to the ruelle pressure when all of the particles can move , as in fluids , for example , although it seems obvious that for @xmath21 , trajectories where the particles rarely collide will dominate the ruelle pressure .",
    "we conclude this paper with a number of remarks : + 1 ) in this paper we have discussed the ruelle pressure for diffusive models with static disorder .",
    "our results indicate that for large systems and for all but a small range of values of the inverse temperature - like parameter @xmath1 , the ruelle pressure is determined by rare fluctuations in the configuration of scatterers , and consequently carries no physical information on the chaotic scattering of the moving particle during its motion through the frozen  in disorder . only in a narrow region around @xmath3",
    "does the thermodynamic formalism yield physically relevant information on the chaotic scattering in diffusive systems with static disorder .",
    "the extension to continuous systems outlined in @xcite has been made explicit here without having to use the usual tools of kinetic theory .",
    "the localization phenomena in the ruelle pressure are in fact most similar to the asymptotic behavior ( stretched exponential decay ) of the survival probability of a random walk in a random array of absorbing traps .",
    "the survival probability is solely determined by the extremely rare fluctuation that the random walk finds itself in the largest region free of traps @xcite .    in different areas of statistical physics",
    "analogous phenomena occur , where the large time or the small frequency / energy asymptotics are controlled by extremely rare spatial fluctuations , such as in lifshitz tails @xcite , griffith s singularities @xcite and directed polymers @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) it has been shown numerically in one dimension @xcite that for finite systems and outside the crossover region the lower bound found for the ruelle pressure is also a good estimate for the pressure itself , indicating that localization on the largest cluster indeed occurs .",
    "we conjecture that in higher dimensions it is the largest _ convex _ cluster inscribed in a set of connected scattering sites that will determine the ruelle pressure .",
    "\\3 ) to allow the dynamical partition function to scan the full structure of our diffusive models with static disorder , time should be sufficiently large that the moving particle can explore the entire volume of the system .",
    "consequently @xmath250 , which determines the physically relevant order of limits . in determining the ruelle pressure in eq.([defz ] ) one takes first the limit @xmath251 for fixed @xmath4 , and next allows @xmath4 to tend to @xmath252 .",
    "therefore , for a fixed system size @xmath4 , the trajectory has an infinite time to explore the system and to find the largest cluster , where it will then stay localized with a high probability .",
    "an interesting open problem remains to explore both the time and size dependence of the dynamical partition function , eq .",
