    "the dynamic response of the ising system in presence of an oscillating magnetic field has been studied extensively [ 1 - 3 ] in the last few years .",
    "the dynamic hysteresis [ 1 - 3 ] and the nonequilibruim dynamic phase transition [ 4 - 6 ] are two important aspects of the dynamic response of the kinetic ising model in presence of an oscillating magnetic field . this kind of phase transition in the ising model was first studied by tome and oliviera [ 4 ] .",
    "they solved the mean field ( mf ) dynamic equation of motion ( for the average magnetisation ) of the kinetic ising model in presence of a sinusoidally oscillating magnetic field .",
    "they have defined the order parameter as the time averaged magnetisation over a full cycle of the oscillating field and showed that depending upon the value of the field and the temperature , the order parameter takes nonzero value from a zero value .",
    "precisely , in the field amplitude and temperature plane there exists a phase boundary separating dynamic ordered ( nonzero value of order parameter ) and disordered ( order parameter vanishes ) phase .",
    "they [ 4 ] have also observed and located a tricritical point ( tcp ) , ( separating the nature ( discontinuous / continuous ) of the transition ) on the phase boundary line ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "however , such a mean field transition is not truely dynamic in origin and exists even in the static ( or zero frequency ) limit .",
    "this is because , if the field amplitude is less than the coercive field ( at temperature less than the transition temperature without any field ) , then the response magnetisation varies periodically but asymmetrically even in the zero frequency limit ; the system remains locked to one well of the free energy and can not go to the other one , in the absence of fluctuation .",
    "lo and pelcovits [ 5 ] first attempted to study the dynamic nature of this phase transition in the kinetic ising model by monte carlo ( mc ) simulation . here",
    ", the transition disappears in the zero frequency limit ; due to the fluctuations , the magnetisation flips to the direction of the magnetic field and the dynamic order parameter ( time averaged magnetisation ) vanishes .",
    "however , lo and pelcovits [ 5 ] have not reported any precise phase boundary .",
    "acharyya and chakrabarti [ 6 ] studied the nonequilibrium dynamic phase transition in the kinetic ising model in presence of oscillating magnetic field by extensive mc simulation .",
    "they [ 6 ] have also identified that this dynamic phase transition is associated with the breaking of the symmetry of the dynamic hysteresis ( @xmath0 ) loop . in the dynamically disordered ( value of order parameter vanishes ) phase the corresponding hysteresis loop is symmetric , and loses its symmetry in the ordered phase ( giving nonzero value of dynamic order parameter ) .",
    "they [ 6 ] also studied the temperature variation of the ac susceptibility components near the dynamic transition point .",
    "the major observation was that the imaginary ( real ) part of the ac susceptibility gives a peak ( dip ) near the dynamic transition point ( where the dynamic order parameter vanishes ) .",
    "the conclusions were : ( i ) this is a distinct signal of phase transition and ( ii ) this is an indication of the thermodynamic nature of the phase transition .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the statistical distribution of dynamic order parameter has been studied by sides et al [ 7 ] .",
    "the nature of the distribution changes near the dynamic transition point .",
    "they have also observed [ 7 ] that the fluctuation of the hysteresis loop area becomes considerably large near the dynamic transition point .    in the equilibrium critical phenomena ,",
    "both the length and time scales diverge at criticality .",
    "this gives rise to the singularities in various thermodynamic quantities , like the specific heat and the relaxation time .",
    "can one expect similar kind of features in the case of this nonequilibrium dynamic phase transition problem ? to be specific , ( i ) is there any relaxation time , in this nonequlibrium problem which diverges at the dynamic transition point ?",
    "( ii ) can there be any appropiately defined specific - heat , which will show singular behaviour at the transition point ?",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to get some answers of these questions at least numerically .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamic phase transition in the kinetic ising model in presence of an oscillating magnetic field has been studied by mc simulation .",
    "also the mf dynamic equation has been solved numerically , to compare the results .",
    "the relaxation behaviour ( defined in the following section ) of the dynamic order parameter [ 4 ] and the behaviour of specific - heat ( defined in section iii ) near the dynamic transition point are studied by mc simulation .",
    "it may be mentioned here that the preliminary results of specific - heat singularity near the dynamic transition point were reported briefly in ref [ 8 ] .",
    "more detailed results are reported here .",
    "the relaxation behaviour has also been studied here by solving numerically the mean field ( mf ) dynamic equation of motion of the kinetic ising model in presence of an oscillating magnetic field .",
    "the mf equation has also been solved exactly in the linearised limit and studied the relaxation behaviour of the dynamic order parameter , near the dynamic transition point .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section ii the relaxation behaviour of the order parameter near the dynamic transition point has been studied both by monte carlo simulation and by solving mean field dynamic equation of motion of the kinetic ising model . in section",
    "iii the temperature variation of the specific - heat has been studied near the transition point only by monte carlo simulation .",
    "a brief summary of all the results is given in section iv .",
    "a ferromagnetically interacting ( nearest neighbour ) ising model in presence of a time varying magnetic field can be represented by the hamiltonian    @xmath1    here , @xmath2 is ising spin variable , @xmath3 is the interaction strength and @xmath4 represents the oscillating magnetic field , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the amplitude and the frequency respectively of the oscillating field .",
    "the system is in contact with an isothermal heat bath at temperature @xmath7 . for simplicity",
    "all @xmath3 are taken equal to unity and periodic boundary condition is chosen .",
    "a square lattice of linear size @xmath8 has been considered . at any finite temperature @xmath7 and for a fixed frequency ( @xmath6 ) and amplitude ( @xmath5 ) of the field , the dynamics of this system has been studied here by monte carlo simulation using glauber single spin - flip dynamics with the metropolis rate of spin flip .",
    "each lattice site is updated here sequentially and one such full scan over the lattice is defined as the time unit ( monte carlo step or mcs ) here .",
    "the initial configuration has been chosen such that the all spins are directed upward .",
    "the instanteneous magnetisation ( per site ) , @xmath9 has been calculated . from the instanteneous magnetisation , the dynamic order parameter @xmath10 ( time averaged magnetisation over a full cycle of the oscillating field )",
    "is calculated .",

    "@xmath7 the dynamic order parameter @xmath11 is nonzero and the corresponding dynamic hysteresis loop ( @xmath0 loop ) is asymmetric and for larger values of @xmath5 and @xmath7 the dynamic order parameter @xmath11 vanishes , correspondingly , the @xmath0 loop becomes symmetric ( inset of fig.1 ) .",
    "the dynamic transition temperature ( @xmath12 ) is a function of field amplitude ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the transition across the dotted line ( in fig.1 ) is discontinuous and that across the solid line is continuous .",
    "for very small values of @xmath5 the nature of the dynamic transition is continuous . in this paper ,",
    "all studies are done in the region where @xmath11 undergoes always a continuous transition .",
    "it has been observed carefully that the dynamic order parameter @xmath11 does not acquire the stable value within the first cycle of the oscillating field .",
    "it takes several cycles ( of the oscillating field ) to get stabilised i.e. , it shows relaxation behaviour . starting from the initial ( all spins are up ) configuration",
    ", the @xmath11 has been calculated for various number ( say @xmath13-th ) of cycles of the oscillating magnetic field and plotted ( inset of fig.2 ) against the number of cycles ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "each value of @xmath11 shown here has been obtained by averaging over 100 random monte carlo samples .",
    "inset of fig .",
    "2 shows a typical relaxation behaviour of the dynamic order parameter @xmath11 .",
    "this has been plotted for fixed values of @xmath14 ,",
    "@xmath5= 1.0 and @xmath7= 1.5 .",
    "it shows that the dynamic order parameter @xmath11 is relaxing as the time ( number of cycles ) goes on .",
    "the best fit curves shows that the relaxation is exponential type .",
    "so , one can write @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the relaxation time which provides the time scale for this nonequilibrium problem",
    ". the physical interpretation of @xmath16 is , the number of cycles required , so that @xmath11 becomes @xmath17 times of its initial value ( value of @xmath11 at starting cycle ) . from the exponential fitting , the relaxation time ( @xmath16 ) has been meseared .",
    "the temperature ( @xmath7 ) variation , for fixed values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 , of this relaxation time @xmath16 has been studied ( in the disordered region of dynamic transition ) and displayed in fig.2 .",
    "the temperature ( @xmath7 ) variation of @xmath16 are shown ( fig.2 ) for two different values of @xmath18 and for a fixed value of @xmath14 here . from the figure ( fig.2 ) it is clear that the relaxation time @xmath16 diverges near the dynamic transition point ( where @xmath11 vanishes ) in the both cases ( @xmath5 = 0.5 and 1.0 ) .        although as mentioned earlier , the mean field system does not undergo a true dynamic transition ( as the transition exists even in the static limit ) , the mean field case has been considered here as a pathological one .",
    "the time evolution of the average magnetisation ( under mean field approximation ) in presence of an oscillating magnetic field can be described by the equation    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the instanteneous magnetisation , @xmath21 is a sinusoidally oscillating magnetic field , @xmath7 is the temperature and @xmath22 is a constant .",
    "this equation has been solved by fourth order runge - kutta method taking @xmath23 and @xmath24=0.01 .",
    "the initial boundary condition is @xmath25 . from the numerical solution for the instanteneous magnetisation @xmath20 ,",
    "the dynamic order parameter @xmath26 has been calculated .",
    "the inset of fig.3 shows a typical relaxation of the dynamic order parameter @xmath11 for @xmath27 , @xmath5 = 0.4 and @xmath7 = 0.765 . here ,",
    "also the exponential type of relaxation is observed and the relaxation time has been measured in the same way , discussed earlier ( in the mc case ) .",
    "fig 3 shows the temperature variation of the relaxation time @xmath16 for @xmath27 and two different values of @xmath5 (= 0.3 and 0.4 ) . here also from the figure ( fig.3 ) it is clear that the typical time scale or the relaxation time @xmath16 for this nonequilibrium problem , diverges , for both the cases ( @xmath5 = 0.3 and 0.4 ) , near the dynamic transition point ( where @xmath11 vanishes ) .      in the limit of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the equation ( [ mf ] )",
    "can be linearised ( i.e. , linearising tanh term ) as @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the solution of the above equation is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two constants .",

    "the above form shows that @xmath11 relaxes exponentially with the number of cycles ( @xmath13 ) of the oscillating field .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath16 is equal to @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted here that the dynamic transition occurs at @xmath7 = 1 in the limit @xmath28 [ 4 ] .",
    "so , for @xmath28 near the dynamic transition point ( where the linearisation holds good ) the behaviour of relaxation time is @xmath41 which shows the power law ( exponent is unity ) divergence of the relaxation time at the dynamic transition point .",
    "the time averaged ( over a full cycle ) cooperative energy of the system may be defined as    @xmath42    and the time averaged ( over a full cycle ) total energy ( including both cooperative and field part ) of the system can be written as    @xmath43    the temperature variations of @xmath44 and @xmath45 have been studied . the specific heat s are defined as @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the temperature variations of the specific - heat s have also been studied and found prominent divergent behaviour near the dynamic transition point ( where @xmath11 vanishes ) .    here , again a square lattice of linear size @xmath48 ( = 100 ) has been considered .",

    "the nonequlibrium dynamic phase transition , in the kinetic ising model in presence of oscillating magnetic field , is studied both by monte carlo simulation and by solving the meanfield dynamic equation of motion .",
