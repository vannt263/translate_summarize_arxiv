    "a flare event on the sun was visually noticed , and recorded by @xcite for the first time . since then , many solar flares have been observed in all the wavelengths , and these are now generally explained by explosive release of the magnetic energy stored around sunspots ( for a review , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the total energy released in the largest solar flares was estimated to be of the order of 10@xmath0 erg ( e.g. @xcite ) , while a possibility has been recently discussed that the most energetic solar flares caused extreme cosmic - ray events evidenced by isotopic abundance research of historical relics @xcite .",
    "such strong solar flares could have a severe effect on the terrestrial environment .",
    "many ` superflares ' were discovered in g - type main sequence stars , namely solar - type stars , in 2012 , and 2013 @xcite , while only nine such events had been reported before it @xcite .",
    "cet and @xmath1 uma rotate with a period of 9.24 d , and 4.89 d , respectively , and are rather young ( age @xmath2 1 gy ) @xcite . ]",
    "superflares are eruptive events having an energy 10 to 10@xmath3 times larger than that of the largest solar flare recorded so far .",
    "such events have been found in many t  tau stars , rs cvn - type binaries , and dme stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . before the advent of high - precision space photometry , however , it had been difficult to detect a superflare in white light in solar - type stars , due to contrast reasons .",
    "indeed , even the largest solar flares could increase the total luminosity of the sun by only 0.03% even at the peak of the event ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this situation has been recently changed by the kepler spacecraft which observed a sky region between cygnus and lyra , monitoring over 160 thousand stars with a cadence of about 30 minutes , and a quite high accuracy exceeding 0.01% for moderately bright stars @xcite .",
    "kepler data have been then used for the stellar flare reseach on cool stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , and on hot stars @xcite .",
    "we hereafter call those solar - type stars showing superflares ` superflare stars ' .",
    "the analyses of the kepler data by @xcite and @xcite revealed that the relation between the occurrence frequency of the flare and the flare energy in the sun can be roughly extended for the flare energy up to @xmath4 erg on superflare stars .",
    "@xcite also estimated that a superflare with an energy of 10@xmath5 erg occurs once in 800 - 5,000 years in sun - like stars , i.e. main - sequence stars with the effective temperature in the range 56006000 k , and the rotational period longer than 10 days ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this rotation period is , however , estimated from the brightness modulation , assuming that it is due to the rotation of the star , whose photosphere is covered by large starspots ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the rotation period then should be spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "in addition , the stellar parameters , and binarity of the superflare stars should be checked for the discussion whether the sun can really give rise to superflares , or not .",
    "we have then performed high - dispersion spectroscopy of superflare stars in our database . in this letter",
    ", we report on the first results of the analysis of high - resolution spectra of two g - type stars , namely kic 9766237 and kic 9944137 , whose rotation period was estimated to be 21.8 , and 25.3 days , respectively @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows an example of the kepler light curve of these targets , around the only one flare of each star automatically detected by the method described by @xcite .",
    "quasi - periodic modulations with an amplitude of @xmath60.1 % , other than the superflare , are clearly present .",
    "the total energy released during the superflares marked in figure [ fig : lc ] is estimated to be @xmath7 erg , and the duration is 0.1 - 0.2 days .",
    "table [ tab : param ] summarizes the effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity of kic 9766237 , and kic 9944137 , listed in the kepler input catalog @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : param ] also lists the data of 18 sco , the best investigated solar twin ( e.g. @xcite ) , for comparison .",
    "( 80mm,115mm)fig1.eps    the details of our observation of the targets are summarized in section 2 .",
    "section 3 describes the observational results , and brief discussion .",
    "the observation of kic 9944137 , and 18 sco was carried out on 2013 june 23 , with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; @xcite ) attached to the 8.2-m subaru telescope .",
    "kic 9766237 was observed with the same instrument on 2013 june 24 .",
    "the total exposure time for kic 9766237 , kic 9944137 , and 18 sco was 4800 sec ( 1200 sec @xmath8 4 sequential images ) , 4200 sec ( 1400 sec @xmath8 3 sequential images ) , and 20 sec ( 10 sec @xmath8 2 sequential images ) , respectively .",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath9 .",
    "the wavelength coverage was 6,100 - 8,820  , which includes the chromospheric - activity sensitive lines of h@xmath10 , and ca ii ir triplet 8498 , 8542 , 8662 .",
    "the 2@xmath82 on - chip binning mode was adopted .",
    "we used the image slicer # 2 @xcite .",
    "we reduced the echelle - image data to 1-dimensional spectra in the standard way with iraf . the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is s / n=60@xmath670 around ca ii 8542 for kic 9766237 , kic 9944137 , and s / n@xmath11200 for 18 sco .",
    "the radial velocity of kic 9766237 , kic 9944137 , and 18 sco was estimated ( see next section ) to be @xmath1256.1(@xmath130.3 ) , @xmath1231.8(@xmath130.3 ) , and 11.9(@xmath130.3 ) km s@xmath14 , respectively , by using the photospheric absorption lines . per each star , all the sequential spectra were combined into a single co - added spectrum , and the correction for the radial velocities was perfomed before the following analyses .",
    "( 80mm,115mm)ha6563.eps      figures [ fig : ha ] , and [ fig : ca ] show absorption lines of h@xmath10 , and ca ii 8542 .",
    "they are good indicators of the chromospheric activity ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". both lines of both targets are slightly shallower than those of the solar twin star , 18 sco , that has the same activity level of the quiet sun on the basis of the mt wilson ca ii s index ( e.g. @xcite ) . the index @xmath15 , the flux normalized by the continuum level at the line core of ca ii 8542 is 0.26 for kic 9766237 , 0.27 for kic 9944137 , and 0.21 for 18 sco .",
    "these index values and effective temperature of @xmath16 for kic 9766237 , and @xmath17 for kic 9944137 ( derived later ) suggest that both targets are in the region dominated by quiescent dwarf stars in figure 6 in @xcite , though the shallowness of h@xmath10 and ca ii , compared with those of 18 sco , indicates a little higher atmospheric activity level of both stars",
    ".    the average magnetic field can be roughly estimated , by using the emission core flux of ca ii .",
    "the relation between the emission core flux of the ca ii k line and the average magnetic field was first derived for cool stars by @xcite .",
    "notsu et al .",
    "( 2014 , in preparation ) have extended this relation to the emission core flux of the ca ii 8542 and the average magnetic field .",
    "the average strength of the magnetic field of kic 9766237 , and kic 9944137 is estimated to be 1 - 20 gauss , by using this method .",
    "this value is of the same order as , or one order of magnitude higher than that of the sun ( @xmath62 g ) .",
    "an example of the photospheric absorption lines is displayed in figure [ fig : fe ] .",
    "the profile of these photospheric lines are in good agreement with that of 18 sco .",
    "this fact suggests that both of kic 9766237 , and kic 9944137 are single stars , or at most single - lined binaries .",

    "the details of this analysis method were described by @xcite .",
    "while the values of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and [ fe / h ] we derived are rather different than those in the kepler input catalog , spectroscopic determination of the stellar parameters are known to be more accurate than the photometric method adopted in the kepler input catalog ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "comparison of our 18 sco data with those in the literature supports the accuracy of our analysis .",
    "the stellar parameters of kic 9766237 , and kic 9944137 derived here indicate that both stars have the surface gravity and metallicity fairly close to those of the sun , although the effective temperature of both stars is a little lower ( @xmath6100 k ) than that of the sun .",
    "the projected rotational velocity of 2.1(@xmath130.3 ) km s@xmath14 of kic 9766237 , and 1.9(@xmath130.3 ) km s@xmath14 of kic 9944137 is consistent with the photometrically estimated rotation period of 21.8 , and 25.3 days , respectively , indicating that the inclination angle @xmath23 is fairly high , @xmath24 deg for kic 9766237 , and @xmath25 deg for kic 9944137 ( figure [ fig : vsini ] ) .",
    "the method to derive the rotational velocity on the basis of the light curve was descibed also by @xcite , while the data of the isochrone used here was replaced by that in @xcite .",
    "the spectra in the region around 6700    are shown in figure [ fig : li ] .",
    "the li i 6708   line is detected neither in the spectrum of kic 9766237 nor in that of kic 9944137 , while it is clearly visible for 18 sco .",
    "the li abundance a(li ) is estimated to be smaller than a(li)=1.0 , on the basis of figure [ fig : li ] .",
    "the upper limit of a(li ) is obtained in another way .",
    "application of the method described in @xcite using the averaged fwhm of weak fe lines , and signal - to - noise ratio , to our spectra gives the upper limit of the equivalent width of this li absorption ew(li ) , ew(li ) @xmath2 4.5 mfor both of our targets .",
    "the upper limit of a(li ) is estimated to be a(li ) = 1.37 for kic 9766237 , and a(li ) = 1.43 for kic 9944137 , by calculations of the chemical abundances on the assumption of the local thermal equilibrium , atmospheric parameters obtained above , and that upper limit of ew(li ) .",
    "we here adopt the a(li ) upper limit of a(li ) = 1.0 , that is , a(li ) @xmath2 1.0 for our targets .",
    "this value is the same as , or less than that of the sun [ a(li)=0.92 ; @xcite ] , and is relatively small in the range of the effective temperature around 5700 k @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests that these stars are not young ( e.g. @xcite ) , and both stars have an age greater than 3 - 4 gy , unless an anomalous lithium depletion has occurred .",
    "this is consistent with that both stars have a long rotation period , while their activity level seems to be higher than that of the sun , based on the chromospheric data and on the lower limit for the relative spot areas of about 0.1 % , which is close to the largest sunspots groups observed ( 0.2 % ) .",
    "we here briefly discuss whether superflares can be explained by the magnetic energy stored on the surface of kic 9766237 , and kic 9944137 .",
    "the average magnetic field of 1 - 20 g is deduced above , and the total energy of the superflare of our targets is 10@xmath26 erg . on the assumption that the radiated flare energy is a fraction [ @xmath27 ;",
    "@xmath28 is assumed in @xcite ] of the magnetic energy stored around the spot area , the flare energy ( @xmath29 ) is expressed as below ( see @xcite ) : @xmath30 in this equation , the length of the magnetic structure responsible for the flare , @xmath31 , has been assumed to be equal to the size of the spotted region , i.e. @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the area of the spot in units of the stellar disk area .",
    "this equation is transformed by replacing the energy with 10@xmath26 erg , as below : @xmath34 if the strength of the magnetic field in the spot area is 20 kg , the fraction @xmath33 is deduced to be of the order of 0.001 with equation [ eq : spotarea ] . in this case , the average magnetic field results in being @xmath620 g , which is in the range derived above .",
    "the 20-kg magnetic field , however , should be too strong , compared to that of the sun , and physically unrealistic , since the magnetic pressure of the spot area should be up to the same order of the gas pressure in the photosphere .",
    "if the strength of the magnetic field in the spot area is 1 kg , the fraction @xmath33 is deduced to be of the order of 0.01 . in this case , the average magnetic field is of the order of 10 g , which is also in the range derived above .",
    "the fraction a=0.01 is , however , an order of magnitude larger than that evaluated from the light curve above .",
    "this implies the existence of a large polar spot which are always visible , and does not effectively contribute to the observed variability ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "more observations are needed for direct measurement of the spot group area , and the magnetic field strength of the spot group area .    in conclusion , although kic 9766237 , and kic 9944137 are superflare stars having showed a superflare with an emitted energy of 10@xmath26 erg , these stars turned out to be a g - type main sequence star with stellar parameters ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and [ fe / h ] ) close to those of the sun , by our high dispersion spectroscopy .",
    "their slow rotation period of 21.8 days ( kic 9766237 ) , and 25.3 days ( kic9944137 ) , and very low lithium abundance of a(li)@xmath21.0 indicate that these stars are not young .",
    "the projected rotational velocity derived here is consistent with the photometric rotation period , and these data indicate that the inclination angles are high ( 70 - 90 deg ) .",
    "line profiles of the photospheric absorption lines are in good agreement with those of 18 sco , suggesting that both of the targets are single stars , though a low - mass companion can not be excluded without additional observations .",
    "the average strength of the magnetic field on kic 9766237 , and kic 9944137 is estimated to be 1 - 20 g , by the depth of ca ii 8542 .",
    "these arguments support the hypothesis that the sun might cause superflares , though the upper limit of this value ( 20 g ) is one order of magnitude larger than that of the sun .",
    "more detailed observations will be needed to clarify the magnetic field on the superflare stars .",
    "the authors sincerely thank the referee , antonio frasca for his very useful and constructive comments .",
    "this study is based on observational data collected at subaru telescope , which is operated by the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "we are grateful to akito tajitsu and other staffs of the subaru telescope for making large contributions in carrying out our observation .",
