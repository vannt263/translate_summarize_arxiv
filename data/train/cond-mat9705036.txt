    "the investigation of low dimensional quantum spin systems has attracted widespread and general interest in active research on a large class of magnetic materials , both experimentally as well as theoretically , since the properties are strongly affected by quantum fluctuations . in particular , there is strong theoretical and experimental effort to understand the origin of singlet - triplet spin gaps in low dimensional spin systems such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which occur in the presence of competing spin ",
    "interactions , e.g. due to a spin ladder geometry .",
    "evidence for frustrated spin ",
    "interactions has also been reported for the quasi ",
    "one  dimensional antiferromagnet @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "initially this compound has received much interest , since it is the first example of an inorganic compound undergoing a spin ",
    "peierls transition  @xcite .",
    "subsequent extensive experimental studies have revealed that many properties of the ordered phase are well described by the well known spin ",
    "peierls scenario  @xcite , such as the presence of a lattice dimerization  @xcite and a singlet triplet spin ",
    "gap scaling with the lattice distortion  @xcite .",
    "however , recently it was found that the formation of the non  magnetic low temperature phase in @xmath0 sensitively depends on details of the magnetic exchange @xcite .    the traditional spin ",
    "peierls theory  @xcite is based on one  dimensional antiferromagnetic chains with nearest - neighbour couplings only .",
    "such magnetic systems do not show any long - range antiferromagnetic order in the groundstate , however they possess critical quantum fluctuations which drive the lattice dimerization , i.e. the spin - peierls transition .",
    "substances with frustrated spin interactions are not strictly governed by @xcite as the magnetic system in these cases may show spontaneous long - range magnetic dimerization in the groundstate even without any lattice dimerization .",
    "the additional spin - phonon coupling merely stabilizes this magnetic dimerization upon developing the lattice distortion .",
    "whether this or the former scenario is realized depends on the strength of the frustration parameter @xmath8 .",
    "frustration of the spin  interactions in @xmath0 has been inferred previously from the investigation of the magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath9 ) in the non - dimerized phase  @xcite , which is in disagreement with a nearest neighbour heisenberg model  @xcite .",
    "a much better agreement has been found in theoretical studies of the spin ",
    "susceptibility @xmath10 invoking a heisenberg chain with competing nearest and next - nearest neighbour exchange couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "however , two markedly different choices of exchange couplings , i.e. @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12  @xcite , were derived within model calculations and the _ same _ experimental data for the magnetic susceptibility as well as inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "for these quantities an increase of @xmath13 on one hand and a decrease of @xmath1 on the other have similar consequences leading apparently to a large uncertainty of the exchange parameters .",
    "thus these previous studies of the quantum magnetism in @xmath0 reveal some evidence for the relevance of magnetic frustration in @xmath0 , whereas it is obviously difficult to extract precise values of the exchange parameters .",
    "a precise knowledge of the ratio @xmath13 is of course very important , since the theory predicts a critical ratio @xmath14 for a spin  gap to develop in the magnetic excitation spectrum .",
    "this gap opens irrespective of a lattice distortion .",
    "the existence of this gap is established exactly at the majumdar ",
    "ghosh point @xmath15 @xcite and by several numerical studies @xcite which strongly suggest @xmath16 .    in order to decide whether the spin gap in @xmath0 is at least partially a manifestation of frustrated spin  interactions in a low dimensional magnet",
    "we have performed a comparative study of theoretical results and experimental data for thermodynamic properties . using our numerical results for the heisenberg chain with nearest and next - nearest neighbour interaction",
    "we show that a comparison of the magnetic susceptibility alone allows for the unique determination of the exchange constants in the frustrated one - dimensional magnet @xmath0 with result @xmath17 , i.e. a frustration significantly larger than the critical value @xmath14 .",
    "in the course of our investigations we also determine the pressure dependence of the coupling parameters from magnetostriction data .",
    "we also analyse the experimental specific heat data on consistency with the theoretical entropy results .",
    "the dominant magnetic interactions in @xmath0 are due to heisenberg spin exchange between @xmath18 ions along the @xmath19-axis of the crystal .",
    "the hamiltonian for the spin chain in the non - dimerized phase reads h=2_i(j_1 _ i _",
    "i+1+j_2 _ i _",
    "i+2 ) , where we have adopted the normalization factor of @xcite .",
    "the nearest neighbour coupling @xmath20 is induced by the exchange path @xmath21 , and the next - nearest neighbour coupling @xmath22 is caused by the path @xmath23 .",
    "a microscopic calculation of @xmath24 is difficult @xcite and independent derivations are important .    in order to obtain quantitative results",
    "we calculate various physical properties in dependence on the couplings @xmath20 and @xmath22 , notably the magnetic susceptibility , and perform a two - parameter fit of the experimental data which have been measured up to 950k .",
    "the aim is to achieve a best fit above the transition temperature @xmath25 within the model of a magnetic system with interactions described above and an adiabatic decoupling of the spin - phonon interactions . in this sense @xmath20 and @xmath22",
    "are treated as effective coefficients explicitly dependent on the lattice geometry , i.e. microscopic bond angles and lattice constants .",
    "unfortunately , analytic results for the thermodynamics of the model are available only for @xmath26 ( nearest - neighbour heisenberg chain ) .",
    "we therefore resort to complete numerical diagonalizations of finite systems with chain lengths up to @xmath27 . in general the numerical treatment of strongly correlated quantum spin chains",
    "is plagued by finite - size effects at _ low temperatures .",
    "here , however , we are interested in relatively high temperatures with @xmath28 .",
    "a comparison of numerical data for successive chain lengths @xmath29 shows that finite size corrections are essentially negligible for our purposes . in figs .",
    "[ susa ] and [ speza ] numerical results for the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat per lattice site are depicted .",
    "note the characteristic dependence of the extremal values @xmath30 and the corresponding @xmath31 on the frustration parameter @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath31 is decreasing with increasing @xmath13 , whereas @xmath30 is increasing .",
    "the behaviour of the specific heat is similar , however its maximal value @xmath32 is a decreasing function of @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , at low temperatures the entropy strongly increases with increasing @xmath13 . _",
    "we first observe that the experimental susceptibility data @xmath9 allow for an unambiguous determination of @xmath20 _ and @xmath22 if we use the position @xmath33 k and absolute value @xmath34 of the maximum of @xmath9 . in practice",
    ", we determine for a sequence of frustration parameters @xmath8 the value of @xmath20 leading to @xmath33 k. for this set of coupling parameters the value of @xmath30 is calculated , see fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the experimental value for @xmath30 is obtained in this plot for @xmath35 within an error of @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath37 as used in @xcite would yield a value of @xmath30 far too large in comparison with the actually measured value .",
    "the nearest neighbour coupling corresponding to @xmath35 is @xmath38 . in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "the susceptibility @xmath9 for the values @xmath39 0.354 and 0.24 is compared with the experimental data .",
    "note the strong deviation of the theoretical curve for @xmath37 from the measured one especially at @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast to this , the entire temperature dependence of @xmath10 is reproduced very well for @xmath35 .",
    "the effect of finite - size corrections on the numerical results has been reduced by a scaling analysis based on a transfer matrix approach @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results are reliable down to temperatures of 35 k. note that a land factor of @xmath40 has been used as derived from esr @xcite .",
    "( furthermore we have assumed a cancellation of van vleck paramagnetism and core diamagnetism which is the most reasonable assumption about the magnetic background .",
    "if we subtract a background of @xmath41 the result would read @xmath42 . ) for the quoted error bars of @xmath20 , @xmath13 a relative error of @xmath43 in the measurements has been taken into account .",
    "also note that a comparable analysis of the data @xcite leads to @xmath44 ( @xmath45 if a background of @xmath41 is subtracted ) , a value which overlaps with the above result .",
    "the differences between our and the data in ref .",
    "@xcite might originate from slightly different orientations of the magnetic fields with respect to the crystal axes .",
    "note that our data agree much better with those in ref .",
    "_    in addition to the strength of the microscopic couplings we can determine their pressure dependence .",
    "we obtain this from magnetostriction data @xcite which are related to the pressure dependence of the magnetic susceptibility @xcite which is rather directly accessible in numerical studies ( l_ih)_p_i= hv(p_i)_h= hv(_1(p_i)_t + _ 2(p_i)_t ) , where @xmath46 denotes the derivative of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath13 . based on this relation and the data for temperatures 40 k and 60 k",
    "we find @xmath47 @xmath48 , and @xmath49 @xmath50 for the three lattice axes",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath19 .",
    "note that the values for the pressure dependence of @xmath13 obtained along this way are consistent with the hydrostatic pressure dependence obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , in our analysis the hydrostatic pressure dependence of @xmath20 is much stronger than that of @xmath22 which is essentially zero .",
    "unfortunately it is impossible to measure the temperature dependence of the magnetic specific heat in @xmath53 directly .",
    "as displayed in the left part of fig.[enta ] at temperatures close to the predicted maximum of @xmath54 the total specific heat is dominated by the phonon contribution @xmath55 , i.e. it is about one order of magnitude larger than the calculated magnetic contribution",
    ". therefore it is impossible to extract @xmath54 with sufficient accuracy to resolve the small differences predicted for different exchange constants in a @xmath56 model , see fig.[speza ] .",
    "note that this would require a knowledge of the phonon contribution with an unrealistic accuracy of the order of @xmath57 or higher .",
    "nevertheless , one can use the measurements of @xmath58 to check different exchange parameters suggested in the literature @xcite for consistency . in the following",
    "we will demonstrate that indeed most of these values for @xmath20 , @xmath22 lead to discrepancies .",
    "it is well known that a reliable separation of magnetic and phonon contributions of @xmath58 is possible at low temperatures @xcite and we will use this separation to estimate the magnetic entropy at higher temperatures .",
    "note that the spin ",
    "peierls phase transition does not modify @xmath55 significantly , i.e. the anomaly of @xmath58 is due to the magnetic contribution .",
    "this is inferred on one hand from the extremely small structural changes at the phase transition and on the other hand consistent with the findings in measurements as functions of magnetic fields and doping  @xcite .",
    "analyses of the specific heat at low temperatures have been reported several times @xcite .",
    "well below @xmath59 @xmath54 shows activated behavior due to the large spin gap .",
    "moreover , at low temperatures , i.e. at and below @xmath59 , the specific heat and correspondingly the entropy are dominated by their magnetic contributions . at low temperatures",
    "the phonon contribution follows the usual @xmath60 law , i.e. @xmath61 with @xmath62 . at higher temperatures @xmath55 deviates from this @xmath60 behavior as illustrated in fig.[enta ] .",
    "the extrapolation of the low temperature behavior exceeds the total specific heat already at moderate temperatures of about 30k .",
    "therefore it may serve as an upper limit for @xmath55 , which we use to derive a lower limit @xmath63 for the magnetic contribution from the data .",
    "below 20k we determine this lower limit simply from the difference @xmath64 by assuming a large value of @xmath65 .",
    "the difference function shows a maximum well above @xmath59 at 20k .",
    "a further extrapolation of this function to higher temperatures leads to a decrease which is unreasonable for an estimate of @xmath54 .",
    "we therefore take the value of @xmath64 at 20k as a lower limit of @xmath54 at temperatures above 20k ( see fig.[enta ] ) . of course",
    "this treatment yields only a very small lower limit for @xmath54 , which is indeed much smaller than the predicted @xmath54 ( see fig.[enta]a ) .",
    "we do not aspire a more realistic extraction of @xmath54 here , since on one hand it is impossible to achieve the necessary accuracy to fix the exchange constants and on the other hand the very conservative estimate of @xmath63 already suffices to rule out certain exchange constants reported for @xmath53 .",
    "> from the lower limit of @xmath54 we have calculated the corresponding minimum magnetic entropy @xmath66 , which is compared to calculations of @xmath67 for several choices of @xmath20 and @xmath22 in the right part of fig.[enta ] .",
    "taking the temperature at the maximum of @xmath9 and assuming @xmath26 yields @xmath68 as described in the initial paper on the spin ",
    "peierls transition in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding entropy is much larger than the lower limit we have extracted from the data .",
    "nevertheless , the specific heat data allow to exclude these parameters . at temperatures slightly above",
    "@xmath59 the calculated magnetic entropy for @xmath69 , @xmath70 amounts to about 95% of the total entropy in @xmath0 .",
    "in other words an unreasonably small phonon background , e.g. with a @xmath71 which is nearly one order of magnitude too small , has to be chosen to account for this large magnetic entropy .    a further suggested value for the intrachain exchange constant in a model with @xmath26 is @xmath72 .",
    "this value has been reported first in @xcite based on their inelastic neutron scattering data . more recently in @xcite the same value and in addition a large ( frustrated ) intrachain exchange was found from the analysis of the dispersion curves in the dimerized phase , i.e. below @xmath59 . it is apparent from fig.[enta ] that the magnetic entropy calculated for these exchange parameters in a one - dimensional model , i.e. for @xmath73 , @xmath70 and above @xmath59 , is significantly smaller than the lower limit @xmath66 extracted from the data .",
    "thus the specific heat does not support the parameters suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular when taking into account a further reduction of the theoretical @xmath67 due to the suggested large interchain exchange .",
    "the three solid lines in the right part of fig.[enta ] correspond to calculations of @xmath67 for different exchange constants and finite @xmath13 . since these entropies have been calculated for finite chains , the results are reliable for temperatures above approx .",
    "the strongest discrepancy between numerical and experimental data is present for the set of parameters @xmath74 .",
    "these parameters have been suggested recently in @xcite to give the best description of the magnetic specific heat in @xmath0 . in this latter work",
    "@xmath54 has been extracted from raman scattering data and it was concluded that it is impossible to fit both the susceptibility and the magnetic specific heat with a single choice of @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , it is apparent from fig.[enta ] that the parameters suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and consequently the `` magnetic specific heat '' extracted from raman scattering is in striking discrepancy to the measurement of the specific heat at low temperatures .",
    "thus our data do not support the reported inconsistency in the determination of exchange parameters from @xmath9 and @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "further investigations seem necessary to explain the striking discrepancy between @xmath54 as revealed in @xcite from quasi ",
    "elastic scattering and the true magnetic specific heat .",
    "the deviation between the data and the calculations for the exchange constants @xmath75 , which have been extracted by castilla et al . from their analysis of the magnetic susceptibility and the dispersion curves ,",
    "is less pronounced .",
    "the calculation of the magnetic entropy is reliable for temperatures larger than 35k where the numerical results are indeed larger than the lower bound we have estimated from the data .",
    "a very nice convergence of theory and experiment appears upon further increasing @xmath13 to 0.354 ( and j=80.2k ) . as shown in fig.[enta ] the magnetic entropy calculated for the parameters which yield the best fit to the susceptibility is always larger than the lower bound extracted from the data .",
    "moreover , it is apparent from fig.[enta ] that the difference between the theoretical @xmath76 and the lower bound systematically decreases with decreasing temperature , i.e. with increasing accuracy of the extracted minimum magnetic entropy .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to extend the theoretical calculations to temperatures of 20k and below . at these temperatures",
    "the data for @xmath67 shown in fig.[enta ] do not only represent a rough lower bound .",
    "close to @xmath59 @xmath67 is markedly larger than @xmath77 for any reasonable @xmath55 ( as mentioned above the curve for @xmath78 corresponds already to 95% of the total entropy ) .",
    "therefore even assuming a significantly smaller phonon background leads only to moderate changes of @xmath67 at these temperatures .    boldly extrapolating the calculated entropy for @xmath79 to lower temperatures",
    "one may conclude that both the value of @xmath67 at @xmath59 as well as its temperature dependence , i.e. the magnetic specific heat , are well described .",
    "in contrast to that for all other choices of exchange parameters in fig.[enta ] significant discrepancies between the model calculations and the experimental data are apparent .",
    "though the accuracy for the determination of @xmath54 is not sufficient to unambiguously determine the exchange constants from these data alone , the specific heat strongly confirms our analysis of the susceptibility . in particular , in contrast to the conclusions of @xcite there is no evidence that it is necessary to invoke markedly different exchange constants to explain @xmath9 and @xmath54 ( at low temperatures )",
    "we have presented numerical results for thermodynamical properties of a quantum spin-1/2 chain with nearest and next - nearest neighbour interactions which is believed to be at the heart of the magnetic system of @xmath0 .",
    "the microscopic interaction parameters have been determined as well as their uniaxial pressure dependence .",
    "we have shown that the frustration parameter is @xmath35 .",
    "this is much larger than the value used for the explanation of raman scattering data @xcite .",
    "we expect our result to be reliable as we have based our reasoning on established thermodynamical relations .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that the experimental magnetic susceptibility data are accounted for in even quantitative details by the quasi one - dimensional model and @xmath35 .    within the present accuracy",
    "the magnetic specific heat calculated for the exchange constants derived from our analysis of @xmath9 is consistent with the analysis of the experimental data . on the other hand for several other choices of exchange parameters which have been suggested for @xmath0 we find not only a worse description of the susceptibility but simultaneously evidence for discrepancies to the specific heat data ."
