    "it is by now established that the first rise in the qcd pressure as calculated from the lattice is well described by the hadron resonance gas @xcite .",
    "this important result offers a simple physical picture in understanding a phase transition from the hadronic world to the quark - gluon plasma : with an increase of the temperature , the meson wave functions start to overlap . due to pauli blocking ,",
    "quarks are then forced to occupy higher quantum  states \" finally to merge into the continuum , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mott ] .",
    "more over , it calls for a description of the lattice data within a unified field - theoretical model where the meson degrees of freedom are interpreted as true @xmath2 bound states .",
    "such a microscopic description might be vital for understanding the quark - hadron transition in general @xcite .",
    "in this contribution we provide a brief explorative account of this _ mott transition _ in a covariant , nonlocal , polyakov - nambu - jona  lasinio ( nl - pnjl ) model @xcite .",
    "quark models in general have a potential to offer a powerful theoretical setup for a systematic introduction of fluctuations beyond the mean field , leading to a virial expansion .",
    "important progress in that direction has been achieved recently @xcite .",
    "the nl - pnjl models are characterized by the running of the mass function in the quark propagator provided by @xmath3 . in order to properly address the mott transition",
    "it is important to study the analytic properties of the quark propagator .",
    "the latter is highly non - trivial due to the fact that the mass `` runs '' in a covariant fashion . utilizing a gaussian form factor @xmath4 it is easy to show that the propagator exhibits an infinite sequence of complex conjugate mass poles ( ccmps ) , if the gap @xmath0 is above the critical value @xmath5 . for @xmath6 , the complex pole , together with its complex conjugate counterpart",
    " fuses \" into a doublet of real poles @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sing ] . in the chiral limit ( @xmath8 )",
    "real poles are provided by the lambert @xmath9-function @xmath10 where the  heavy \" state is non - physical in the sense @xmath11 . by contrast , the  light \" state quickly joins the mass gap @xmath0 at high @xmath12 where it can be interpreted as a physical state , see fig .  [",
    "fig : sing ] .    for the model parameters which we employ here @xcite always holds @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the physical continuum of states appears only at temperatures above @xmath14 .",
    "the central object of our study is the meson polarization function @xcite @xmath15~ , \\label{pol}\\ ] ] with @xmath16 being the quark degrees of freedom , and @xmath17 we use the following notation : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are the bosonic matsubara frequencies .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24      in a first attempt to discuss the mott effect , we consider the meson masses as given by the spatial , or screening masses , from the respective bethe - salpeter equations @xmath25 . while for the widths we calculate the imaginary part of ( [ pol ] ) .",
    "details of this calculation are provided in @xcite . for the meson at rest @xmath26",
    "we find @xmath27 & = \\frac{d_q}{16\\pi } \\left[1- 2 n_\\phi(q_0/2)\\right ] \\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{2m_l}{q_0}\\right)^2}f^2\\left(\\frac{q_0 ^ 2}{4}-m_l^2\\right)\\\\ & \\times   \\frac{k_m\\left(0,\\frac{q_0 ^ 2}{4}-m_l^2,-q_0 ^ 2,0\\right ) } { \\left[\\mathcal{d } ' \\left(-\\frac{q_0",

    "for details see , e. g. , ref .  @xcite . in the local limit",
    "@xmath30 , it is easy to show that the standard pnjl result @xciteis correctly reproduced . in deriving this formula",
    "we have ignored the threshold for the meson to decay to a heavy state @xmath31 , as well as possible mixed channels @xmath32 . for the meson width we use @xmath33}{m_m } ~ , \\label{wid}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the residue of the meson propagator . in numerical calculations",
    "we assume that the leading effect of @xmath34 is to cancel the @xmath35 term in @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "( blue ) and @xmath0 meson ( red ) . the  continuum \" threshold @xmath37 is shown in black .",
    "the range of a half - width around the meson mass is given by dashed lines.,width=302,height=188 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluc ] we present results of our approach . besides the spatial meson masses and widths , the `` continuum '' states defined by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , are also shown . strictly speaking ,",
    "these states are not present as real singularities of the quark propagator up to @xmath39 , giving a distinctive feature of covariant models . nevertheless , at @xmath14 , they are almost identical to the actual singularities , see fig . [",
    "fig : sing ] , and therefore provide an intuitive picture also in the low temperature region .    as the temperature increases the continuum threshold drops , eventually hitting the meson masses at the mott temperature @xmath40 .",
    "from that point on the sharp meson states become resonances by acquiring a finite width . around the same temperature the @xmath0 and",
    "the @xmath1 meson become degenerate thus making the restoration of the chiral symmetry manifest .",
    "in contrast to the local pnjl calculation , see e. g. @xcite , we find a smaller width , and a significantly higher mass , their ratio being even around @xmath41 at @xmath42 mev , see fig [ fig : fluc ] .",
    "the latter is a common feature of spatial masses .    while the presented calculation already reveals some aspects of the nonlocality of the interaction , namely a significant reduction of the width of the resonance , the crucial step in properly accounting for the mott transition in covariant models is still lacking .",
    "while at low @xmath12 we expect bound states to dominate the thermodynamics , the 2-particle correlation contribution in the high temperature regime shall come from the quark - antiquark scattering @xcite .",
    "we find that in covariant models such an approach is hindered by the additional ( unphysical ) singularities , making the original physical picture blurry .",
    "for example to account for the scattering , one needs to put quarks on shell ( which is possible after @xmath39 ) .",
    "this calls for a wick rotation of the effective interaction itself . at least with a gaussian regulator such an approach would yield a term @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the typical energy of the process .",
    "thus , when @xmath45 , scattering would seemingly grow without bound and eventually violate unitarity .",
    "it is then clear that knowing the effective dressing of the quarks only in euclidean space is insufficient .",
    "moreover , one easily imagines that by using different analytic choices for the regulators in euclidean space , these might behave quite differently in the complex energy plane , although being qualitatively same in euclidean space .",
    "we believe that a more appropriate `` gauge '' for fully accounting the physics of the mott transition might be the coulomb gauge @xcite , or its covariant formulations @xcite , where the interaction does not depend on the energy .",
