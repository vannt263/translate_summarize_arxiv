    "recent experimental and theoretical work on diffusive charge transport in mesoscopic n / s samples [ 1 - 39 ] have revealed a strong energy dependence of an excess quasiparticle contribution to the low temperature conductance of normal ( n ) parts in close proximity to superconductors ( s ) ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a characteristic energy scale is set by the thouless energy @xmath1 below which a re - entrance to normal conduction is seen as the bias voltage or temperature is lowered ( @xmath2 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath3 is the distance between the superconductors ) . in samples of the andreev interferometer type with two n",
    "/ s interfaces the excess conductance oscillates as a function of the phase difference @xmath4 between two superconductors .",
    "conductance maxima occur at even multiples of @xmath5 , their magnitude peaks at @xmath6 and becomes vanishingly small at low energies .",
    "these oscillations have been explained by nazarov and stoof as a `` thermal effect '' @xcite and can be understood in terms of competing contributions from the condensate wave functions to the density of states or in terms of quasi - particle trajectories between the n / s interfaces in ref .",
    "@xcite , a strong interference effect due to resonant transmission of quasiparticles through andreev levels was shown to take place in superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( s / n / s ) heterostructures at temperatures corresponding to energies much below the ballistic thouless energy @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the fermi velocity ) .",
    "the effect results in giant peaks in the conductance  proportional to the number @xmath9 of conducting transverse modes  whenever the phase difference @xmath4 between the superconductors is an odd multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "arguments were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for this result to be valid also in the diffusive diffusive transport regime .",
    "andreev levels are bound states formed in a normal sample element by successive andreev reflections of quasiparticle excitations at two s / n - interfaces .",
    "a peculiar feature of these bound states is that they carry the supercurrent ( if any ) between the two superconductors .",
    "these levels can also carry a normal transport current if the sample is coupled to reservoirs of normal electrons @xcite .",
    "such a transmission is of a resonant type if the coupling is weak enough not to destroy the andreev levels themselves .",
    "this is the case when the reservoirs are coupled through tunneling barriers of low transparency .",
    "it is important that , in addition , such barriers serve as quantum scatterers extended in two dimensions ; they split quasiclassical electron trajectories incident from the reservoir , or returning towards the reservoir after having been andreev reflected from an n / s boundary .",
    "this enables the trajectory of a quasi - particle with zero excitation energy ( measured from the fermi level ) to connect _ both _ s / n - interfaces ( necessary for picking up information about @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the phases of superconductors 1 and 2 ) and a reservoir ( to affect the current ) as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in this work , which is based on an analysis of the quasiparticle trajectories in a disordered normal conductor weakly coupled to reservoirs , we calculate how the two - terminal conductance between two normal resrvoirs depend on both the superconductor phase difference and temperature .",
    "we pay special attention to non - andreev ( normal ) reflections at the n / s boundaries . including these , the character of the resonance is changed shifting the maximum of the amplitude of conductance oscillations to nonzero temperatures . in our concluding section",
    "we discuss recent experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where an anomalous low - temperature behavior of the conductance was observed .",
    "figure  1 shows the geometry of the sample under consideration . a mesoscopic normal region in contact with two superconductors",
    "is coupled to two reservoirs of normal electrons through tunneling potential barriers of low transparency . the quasiparticle motion in the normal region",
    "is assumed to be affected by a smoothly varying disorder potential and is treated semiclassically .    according to the landauer - lambert formula @xcite the conductance of the system corresponding to a current between two normal electron reservoirs",
    "can be written in terms of the probability @xmath13 for electrons impinging from one reservoir with energy @xmath14 to be reflected as holes back into the same reservoir and in terms of the probability @xmath15 for them to be transmitted to the other reservoir as electrons .",
    "for the case of two equal barriers one has @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "our objective is to calculate the `` electron - hole transmission '' probability @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) .",
    "this is sufficient , since it can be shown that due to the destructive interference among the relevant trajectories , @xmath18 is only weakly affected by the superconductor phase difference @xmath19 .",
    "hence the effective transmission probability @xmath20 for our problem , to be calculated below , is given by @xmath13 .",
    "an electron impinging on the lower potential barrier in fig .",
    "1 from the reservoir gets , after possibly interacting with the barrier and the two s / n interfaces in the n - region , backscattered in the electron and hole channels with probability amplitudes @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) respectively .",
    "the coordinate @xmath23 lies in the plane of the barrier , the @xmath24-axis being perpendicular to the barrier plane .",
    "accordingly , the wave function of the electron @xmath25 and hole @xmath26 in the reservoir can be written as @xmath27 the probability for electron - hole transmission , which we need to calculate , is connected with the amplitude @xmath28 by the relation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the area of the tunnel barrier .",
    "the wave function in the normal region n near the potential barrier is also characterized by electron and hole components , @xmath31 \\\\",

    "we assume that these functions smoothly  in the semiclassical sense  go to zero at the perimeter of the injector reservoir and are equal to zero in the plane @xmath37 outside the injector .    using the language of semiclassical propagation",
    "we now construct the wavefunction in the n - region ( see fig .",
    "1 ) for the electron impinging on the lower barrier from the reservoir .",
    "we do so by mapping it to the wave function ( [ reserv ] ) at the injector barrier .",
    "such a mapping is possible if the disorder potential does not cause any noticable divergence of a tube of trajectories with the transverse size of the order of @xmath32 as they propagate for a certain length . in our case",
    "this characteristic length is the length covered by quasiparticle diffusing across the sample ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the procedure for doing the semiclassical mapping can be reduced to the following . for a given point @xmath38 in the n region",
    "we have to introduce all different trajectories which connect this point with points on the barrier ( where the momentum of the quasiparticle is @xmath39 ) , and experiencing all possible sequences of scatterings induced by n / s boundaries and barriers . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the semiclassical wavefunction can be constructed as a sum of partial contributions @xmath40 corresponding to these trajectories , expressed in terms of the classical action @xmath41 .",
    "as a result one has @xmath42 if a trajectory is split by interacting with a tunnel barrier or n / s interface , the wavefunction along that trajectory undergoes a transformation described by the scattering matrix already mentioned .",
    "the smoothly varying function @xmath43 can be found from the continuity equation for the current density , which together with the hamilton - jacobi equation for the action , guarantees that eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) is a solution of the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can readily verify that the wavefunction ( [ wf ] ) , constructed as a sum over trajectories , satisfies the boundary conditions corresponding to the scattering at the barriers and interfaces .",
    "the wave function formally constructed in eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) does not permit us to carry out concrete calculations in a general case .",
    "the reason lies in the complications that arise due the bifurcations of trajectories as they undergo andreev and normal reflections at the n / s boundaries .",
    "the situation is drastically simplified in the region of small energies , @xmath44 , where reflections in the andreev channel send the quasiparticle back along the incident trajectory .",
    "this implies that the trajectory bifurcations disappear and the problem reduces to an analysis of one - dimensional quasiparticle motion along a single trajectory with centers for back ( andreev ) and forward ( normal ) scattering .    a trajectory of this type is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in this case the problem to find the wavefunction at the boundary [ see eq .",
    "( [ reserv ] ) ] is reduced to a quantum scattering problem for the configuration shown in fig .",
    "the points of reflection at the n / s boundaries and the points of scattering at the tunnel barrier are shown with black dots and black bars , respectively .",
    "propagation between these points is coherent in both electron and hole channels , which is illustrated by dashed and solid lines of equal lengths . for quasiparticles with finite energy @xmath14",
    "the phase gains along the electron and hole trajectories do not completely cancel since the momenta are now different .",
    "the resulting decompensation effect is of order @xmath45 .",
    "and a reflected hole of energy @xmath46 are to be considered identical since they separate by less than @xmath32 while diffusing a distance @xmath3 if @xmath44 . ]",
    "wave functions in the adjacent sections of fig .",
    "1b are connected by a scattering matrix describing andreev and normal reflections at the n - s boundary .",
    "the problem of evaluating the electron - hole transmission can now be formulated as follows .",
    "an electron in the reservoir arrives at the tunnel barrier ( solid up - arrow in fig .",
    "1b ) , and we have to find the amplitude of the outgoing wave function in the hole channel ( dashed up - arrow ) .",
    "this problem is reduced to solving a set of matching equations for amplitudes of electron @xmath47 and hole @xmath47 excitations in every section of propagation between scattering points .",
    "a further simplification follows as a consequence of the resonant transmission caused by multiple electron - hole transformations .",
    "such a resonance occurs , as we will show , if the superconductor phase difference @xmath19 is close to an odd multiple of @xmath0 corresponding to a large number of trajectories contributing to a constructive interference between scattering events .",
    "if @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the probability amplitude for non - andreev ( normal ) reflection at an n / s boundary , the main contribution comes from trajectories wich do not include successive reflections at the same n / s boundary .",
    "taking these observations into account the following set of algebraic matching equations emerge , @xmath50    the amount of phase gained after propagation along the trajectories in section @xmath51 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is propagation time in section n. the quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 are , respectively , the probability amplitudes for andreev and normal reflection at n / s boundaries 1 and 2 . phases and amplitudes of an electron or hole along the semiclassical paths are defined in such a way that no phase has been gained at the beginning of a particular electron or hole section @xmath51 . hence the amplitude is @xmath57 at the beginning of the section , and @xmath58 at its end .",
    "the phase gain between the tunnel barrier and the left n / s boundary ( n / s boundary 1 ) is denoted by @xmath59 . in eq.([seta ] ) a coefficient @xmath60 characterizing the coupling through the tunnel barrier has furthermore been introduced .",
    "we note that one can show that the large phases @xmath61 can be removed from the set of equations ( [ seta ] ) .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that the electron and hole phase gains compensate each other at @xmath62 .    according to our construction the probability @xmath63 of an electron - hole transmission at the point @xmath64 of the barrier",
    "is related to the amplitude @xmath65 on the trajectory of fig .  1 corresponding to injection at point @xmath64 as , @xmath66 equations ( [ seta ] ) and ( [ connetion ] ) together with ( [ intcon ] ) give the complete solution for the oscillatory , @xmath19-dependent part of the excess conductance .    when @xmath67 , eq .",
    "( [ seta ] ) gives a set of andreev levels @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , one can expect that if @xmath69 the trasmission probabilty @xmath70 is of the breit - wigner form .",
    "indeed , as shown in appedix 1 , the transmission probability @xmath70 in this limit can be expressed as @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the spacing of andreev levels generated by the trajectory when @xmath67 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ seta ] ) for @xmath75 and @xmath67 .",
    "because of the random variation of propagation times @xmath54 , the functions @xmath74 are localized along the one - dimensional ladder shown in fig",
    ".  1b .",
    "further simplifications arise as one integrates the electron - hole transmission probability @xmath70 [ see eq .",
    "( [ intcon ] ) ] over the area of the injector area and over the the fermi surface in momentum space .",
    "this integration corresponds to summing over different trajectories and one can think of it as averaging over various distributions of @xmath54 .",
    "it follows that @xmath20 can be expressed as @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath30 is the area of the injector and @xmath78 implies an averaging over @xmath54 . if @xmath79 one can neglect the width of the resonance for relevant energies , @xmath80 , and conclude that @xmath81    the distribution of propagation times @xmath54 depends on the details of the disordered potential in the mesoscopic normal region .",
    "these are not known , but it is natural to assume that propagation times along different sections of the semiclassical trajectory ( see fig .",
    "1a ) are uncorrelated . under this assumption",
    "one can , as detailed in appendix 1 , directly express the transmission probability @xmath20 in terms of the average density of andreev states coupled with the reservoir , does not depend on @xmath51 if the @xmath54 s are uncorrelated ] @xmath82 with @xmath83 here @xmath84 is the density of andreev states generated by a given semiclassical trajectory when @xmath67 .    in order to proceed with an analytical approach we choose a lorentz form for the distribution function @xmath85 , @xmath86 as shown in appendix 2 , this choice permits us to derive an analytical expression for the averaged density of state @xmath87 ( we have used @xmath88 , see @xcite ) . the quantity @xmath89 in the integrand of eq .",

    "it is straightforward to find this density of states to be @xmath91 the energies @xmath92 and @xmath93 are lower and upper edges of the energy band of the periodic chain of fig .",
    "they can be expressed in terms of the  hopping integral \" @xmath94 as @xmath95 finally , using eqs .",
    "( [ cond ] ) , ( [ density ] and [ nufinal ] ) one finds that the low - temperature conductance can be expressed as @xmath96 where @xmath97 with @xmath98 defined by eq.([thouless ] ) .",
    "the excess conductance @xmath99 is plotted as function of phase difference in fig .  2 , while the maximum oscillation amplitude @xmath100 is plotted as a function of temperature in fig .",
    "we emphasize two distinguishing features : 1 ) the excess conductance has sharp maxima at @xmath101 ; 2 ) the peak oscillation amplitude has a maximum value for a temperature much below the thouless temperature , @xmath102 , which qualitatively distinguish these results from those obtained for a completely transparant boundary between the mesoscopic region and the reservoirs . without potential barriers between the reservoirs and the mesoscopic normal region there are no andreev states that can contribute to the inter - reservoir transport . with such barriers present andreev levels",
    "are well defined and long - lived .",
    "the peak of the conductance in fig .",
    "2 is due to resonant tunneling through a macroscopic number of such andreev levels . a small amount of non - andreev ( normal )",
    "quasiparticle reflection at the n / s boundaries is not , as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , detrimental to the resonant tunneling effect .",
    "rather it results in an energy shift of the position of the resonance ( provided the probability for normal reflections at the two n / s boundaries are different ) . as a result",
    "the position of the maximum of the peak amplitude is shifted to a finite temperature , @xmath103 .",
    "we have shown that resonant tunneling through andreev levels may give rise to an excess quasiparticle contribution to the normal conductance of an s / n / s sample at energies much below the thouless energy and with maximal amplitude when the phase difference between the superconductors is on _ odd _ multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "that resonant tunnelling through andreev levels could give rise to a `` giant '' effect was proposed for the case of a ballistic normal region in ref .",
    "the effect discussed here is not sensitive to the details of the semiclassical motion of quasiparticles inside the disordered normal region .",
    "a more remarkable fact is that the main conclusion about the importance of resonant transmission through a macroscopically large number of andreev levels seems to be valid not only for a smooth disorder potential allowing a semiclassical analysis to be carried out as done here .",
    "indeed , one can consider the density of states in an s / n / s junction isolated from reservoirs and solve the eilenberger - usadel equation , which is valid for a short - range disorder potential in the normal region .",
    "this approach gives , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , a gap in the spectrum which closes at @xmath104 with the density of states diverging at @xmath62 . in recent experiments @xcite oscillations of the conductance @xmath99 have been observed , which are well described in the framework of the thermal effect of nazarov and stoof @xcite at temperatures around the thouless temperature , @xmath105 , but are significantly diferent from what the thermal effect can explain at lower temperatures .",
    "the conductance maxima were found to be @xmath0-shifted in both experiments in the range of low temperatures .",
    "the maximum oscillation amplitude @xmath106 was observed at @xmath107 mk ( the thouless temperature was @xmath108 mk @xcite ) .",
    "one may speculate ( see @xcite ) that grain boundaries and geometrical feauters of the contacts act to split the semiclassical quasiparticle trajectories in the same sense as the potential barriers in the model used here . if so one would expect the thermal effect @xcite and the resonant tunneling effect to co - exist . in this case",
    "the cross - over in the phase and temperature dependences of the conductance oscillations could be understood as a result of competition between thehigh temperature \" thermal effect and the  low temperature \" resonant tunneling through andreev levels .",
