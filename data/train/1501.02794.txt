    "in its basic features , our implementation @xcite of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) follows the formulation @xcite based on iterating the `` coherent interactor '' matrix @xmath82 for sites with chemical and/or spin disorder , which is defined as @xmath83 where @xmath11 is the complex energy , @xmath84 is the coherent potential and @xmath85 the on - site auxiliary green s function .",

    "is adjusted to eliminate the deviation of the magnetic moment from the prescribed direction @xmath123 .",
    "thus , at self - consistency , the local moment is collinear with the exchange - correlation field direction @xmath123 , while the total effective magnetic field is rotated by an angle @xmath128 with respect to @xmath123 .    for the @xmath12 states there is an additional complication that the orientations of the induced local moments on the pt atoms are not known in advance .",
    "these orientations are also updated at each iteration using the output directions of the induced magnetic moments , guaranteeing full dft self - consistency in the final state .    as explained in the main text , the vdlm and noncollinear cpa calculations were performed for a number of concentrations with experimental lattice parameters .",
    "the calculated ( about 200 ) total energies for each candidate @xmath12 phase at the given concentration are then fitted to a polynomial in the four order parameters @xmath130 , @xmath131 ( where 1 and 2 label the ordering types , e.g. f and g for phase f / g ) : @xmath132 . the polynomials @xmath133 and @xmath134 include all even terms up to sixth order , and @xmath135 includes all products of second - order monomials in @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( lower - order terms in @xmath135 are forbidden by symmetry ) .",
    "this fit also covered the two @xmath136 phases , which are obtained at @xmath137 or @xmath138 .",
    "3 of the main text illustrates the quality of the fit and its energy profile for fully ordered f / g phase at one selected concentration @xmath45 . the actual expression",

    "( @xmath135 vanishes in the @xmath136 phases described by the vdlm method . )",
    "since these calculations ( contrary to vdlm ones ) are done only for magnetically - ordered phases , certain higher - order terms in @xmath135 would be linearly dependent within the available dataset and could not be distinguished .",
    "indeed , in a fully - ordered @xmath12 phase we have @xmath142 , and terms like @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 are linearly dependent .",
    "therefore , for most concentrations we restricted @xmath135 to fourth - order terms , which are expected to be the most important .",
    "however , at the mn - rich end the interaction of the fe spins with the mn host has a particularly strong non - heisenberg character in the f / c phase , making the fourth - order fit for @xmath135 insufficient .",
    "therefore , at @xmath146 we added sixth - order terms to @xmath147 that are second - order in f and fourth - order in c order parameters ( such as @xmath148 , etc . ) .",
    "in addition , to provide a consistent fit for both g / c and f / c phases , in this concentration range we combined all input data to obtain a single fit for the @xmath149 structure involving all three order parameters .",

    "<S> however , all first - order transitions turn into second - order ; the f / g to g transition is shifted to much larger concentrations , and the f / c phase disappears completely . </S>",
