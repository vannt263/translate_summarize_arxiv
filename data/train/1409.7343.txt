    "nowadays the development of the theory of the wave reactors with internal safety ( reactors of feoktistov type )  @xcite as well as of the natural georeactor  @xcite is topical .    in  @xcite by an example of originally engineering uranium , irradiated by an external neutron source , for the arising uranium - plutonium fissile medium ( the fertile nuclide @xmath4 and the fissile nuclide @xmath5 ) l.p .",
    "feoktistov proposed a criterion ( a condition ) , the fulfillment of which in the neutron multiplication medium leads to a stationary wave of slow nuclear burning formation .",
    "the feoktistov criterion consists in the condition that the equilibrium concentration of a fissile nuclide ( for the considered neutron multiplication medium ) must exceed its critical concentration . for the uranium - plutonium chain of nuclear reactions considered in  @xcite , by _ equilibrium _ and _ critical _ concentrations of the active component @xmath5 we mean the concentrations , for which the rate of the active component nuclei creation is equal to the rate of their disappearance during nuclear reactions , and the rate of neutron birth is equal to the rate of their absorption , respectively . for the particular case considered in  @xcite ,",
    "this criterion reads : @xmath6 .",
    "since the computer modeling of the neutron multiplication medium kinetics is a very complicated problem , requiring large computational burden , the check of the feoktistov criterion becomes the only way of the preliminary search for nuclide composition of the neutron multiplication medium and the external parameters , for which the realization of a slow nuclear burning wave is possible .",
    "however , conducting of such a search is even more complicated by the fact that the equilibrium and critical concentrations of the fissile nuclide , present in the feoktistov criterion , are functions of the energy spectrum of neutrons , which changes with the nuclide composition and the external parameters such as the temperature , the pressure and geometry of a fissile medium .",
    "although in  @xcite the other problem was solved and investigated , it is of undoubtful interest for our subject and makes a certain contribution into theoretical generalization of the possible neutron multiplicative burning processes and substantiation of the possibility of the wave burning realization in the thermal region of neutron energies in principle .",
    "a chain nuclear reaction on thermal neutrons in the large neutron - multiplication system in the form of a cylinder or a parallelepiped of big length ( one of the geometric parameters must exceed two others considerably ) was considered in the one - group diffusion - age approximation in  @xcite .",
    "the chain nuclear reaction was initiated by the external neutron source , which was set by its neutron density flux on the cylinder butt ( the problem ii in  @xcite ) .    at the same time in",
    "@xcite the thermal neutron density @xmath7 satisfies the following diffusion integro - differential equation , which can be derived from the effective one - group equation in the diffusion - age approximation  @xcite , taking into account that the so - called age of thermal neutrons @xmath8 is proportional to the mean value of the squared neutron shift during the deceleration process from the point of fast neutron birth to the point of thermal neutron birth ( see e.g.  @xcite ) :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the diffusion coefficient for thermal neutrons , @xmath11 is their lifetime with respect to capture , @xmath12 is the neutron infinite multiplication factor , @xmath13 is the mean neutron moderation length .",
    "the form of the integrand in  ( [ eq01 ] ) supposes that all dimensions of a neutron - multiplication system are considerably larger than the neutron moderation length @xmath13 .",
    "let us note that although integration in  ( [ eq01 ] ) is performed over the volume occupied by the neutron - multiplication medium , in fact , because of the smallness of the mean neutron moderation length @xmath13 in comparison with typical dimensions of the system , it covers only a small neighbourhood of the point @xmath14 with the diameter of the order of @xmath13 .",
    "this allows to extend the limits of integration in  ( [ eq01 ] ) , containing the gaussian function , to infinity with exponential accuracy .    as of the neutron multiplication factor",
    ", it was set in  @xcite in the form of the known four factor formula for thermal reactors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and neglecting the fast multiplication factor @xmath15 , which is close to unity for thermal reactors ( @xmath16 ) :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the average number of neutrons , generated under capture of one neutron by the fuel , @xmath19 is a probability of thermal neutron absorption by an uranium nucleus , @xmath20 is the probability function for the resonance neutron absorption by uranium-238 nuclei .",
    "however , in order to simplify the problem , only the kinetic equation for neutrons was considered , and the kinetic equations for densities of nuclides in the multiplication fissile medium were not taken into account .",
    "otherwise one had to solve the system of kinetic equations with nonlinear feedbacks ( an example of such kinetic system of 20 equations is presented below in section  [ sec05 ] , as well as e.g. in  @xcite ) .",
    "really , the neutron multiplication factor in  @xcite was set at the level of the expression  ( [ eq02 ] ) , although , as is known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , each of the factors present in  ( [ eq02 ] ) depends on the composition of the fuel fissile medium and its construction , for example , @xmath18 is set by the following expression :",
    "@xmath21    where @xmath22 is the average number of neutrons , generated by the fission of one nucleus of the @xmath23 fissile nuclide , @xmath24 is the fission cross - section of the @xmath23 nuclide , @xmath25 is the neutron absorption cross - section of the @xmath23 nuclide , @xmath26 is the density of the @xmath23 nuclide nuclei .",
    "thus , in  @xcite the change of the fissile medium composition was not taken into account , and the process of neutron multiplication was described at the level of the neutron multiplication factor ( the expressions ( [ eq01 ] ) and ( [ eq02 ] ) ) , which is known to depend on the nuclide composition of the fissile medium and cross - sections of neutron - nuclear reactions ( the expression ( [ eq03 ] ) ) . the cross - sections , in their turn , depend on the neutron energy and can change their values considerably ( see e.g. figures  [ fig:01 ] and  [ fig:02 ] ) . therefore , under such a simplified description , the dependences on the fissile medium composition and the neutron energy were at the back of the multiplication factor . naturally , this imposed corresponding restrictions on the solutions obtained and conclusions made in  @xcite .",
    "the solution of the kinetic equation for the density of thermal neutrons  ( [ eq01 ] ) was obtained in  @xcite for a semi - infinite parallelepiped ( @xmath27 ) of square section ( @xmath28 ) , on the butt of which ( @xmath29 ) either the flux @xmath30 , or the neutron density @xmath31 was set , corresponding to presence of the external neutron source at the butt ( the problem ii in  @xcite ) .",
    "the investigation of its behavior for asymptotics with respect to time and parallelepiped length was also carried out for two particular cases of the above - critical and subcritical states of the neutron multiplication fissile medium .",
    "let us note that the choice of geometry of a fissile medium in the form of a cylinder or a parallelepiped of large length was made in  @xcite , because in this case the above - critical or subcritical states practically do not depend on the length , i.e. one can neglect the influence of butts , and the ratio of the surface area to the volume remains practically constant with the length change .",
    "following  @xcite , if the system is surrounded by vacuum , and its dimensions are large in comparison with the neutrons free path , the boundary condition at the external lateral surface ( @xmath32 ; @xmath33 ) consists in the equality of the neutron density to zero .",
    "thus , we look for the solutions of  ( [ eq01 ] ) in the following form :    @xmath34    let us note that , of course , the zero neutron flux density should be set on the extrapolated lateral surface of the system , but this inaccuracy in  @xcite may be disregarded , since it can be easily corrected .",
    "substituting  ( [ eq04 ] ) into the equation  ( [ eq01 ] ) we get the following equation for the function @xmath35 :    @xmath36    since the diffusion flux reads @xmath37 , the boundary and initial conditions for the problem ii in  @xcite have the form :    @xmath38    at the same time the boundary conditions on the butt of the cylinder were as follows :    @xmath39    the solution of the equation  ( [ eq05 ] ) with the initial and boundary conditions  ( [ eq06 ] ) and  ( [ eq07 ] ) ( the problem ii in  @xcite ) with the help of the direct and inverse fourier transforms was obtained in  @xcite in the following form :    @xmath40    where    @xmath41    is called the effective diffusion coefficient  @xcite ,    @xmath42    is the effective neutron multiplication factor .    in  @xcite the obtained solution  ( [ eq08 ] )",
    "was studied assuming that the neutron flux is constant at the boundary of the right - angled cylinder for @xmath29 , i.e. it does not depend on time . in this case",
    "the solution  ( [ eq08 ] ) is simplified and has the following form :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 represents a designation for the integral in  ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "authors of  @xcite were first of all interested in the above - critical mode @xmath45 , and it was shown that in this case one can speak about some velocity of slow nuclear burning . in order to find this velocity ,",
    "asymptotics of the expression  ( [ eq11 ] ) for were considered for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , i.e. in observation points moving along the body axis with one or another constant velocity @xmath49 .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath35 are easily reproduced , if one transforms the integral @xmath44 in  ( [ eq11 ] ) via the substitution of variables to the form of the standard laplace integral @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a large positive parameter , and @xmath52 is a real number  @xcite .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , if one introduces the quantities    @xmath53    and    @xmath54    having dimensionalities of velocity and length , then , if the quantity @xmath55 in the exponential function in the integral @xmath44 , transformed to the form of the standard laplace integral , is a large parameter ( @xmath56 ) , integrating @xmath44 by parts , we find the main term of asymptotics of the integral @xmath44 and , accordingly , the asymptotics of the expression  ( [ eq11 ] ) for the neutron density @xmath35 for @xmath57 , @xmath47 in the following form :    @xmath58   \\varphi \\left ( \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{v_0}{v } - \\frac{v}{v_0 } \\right ) \\right ) = { } \\nonumber \\\\ { } & = \\frac{4 j_0}{\\sqrt{\\pi z } } \\sqrt{d^ * } \\exp \\left [ \\frac{z}{l_0 } \\left ( \\frac{v_0}{v } - \\frac{v}{v_0 } \\right ) \\right ] \\frac{v ^{1/2}}{v^2 + v_0 ^2 } \\label{eq14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as it is seen from  ( [ eq14 ] ) , for all constant velocities @xmath59 the quantity @xmath35 exponentially grows up with the increase of the distance @xmath60 from the cylinder butt ( or with time , since @xmath46 ) . at the same time in the case @xmath61 , on the contrary , the quantity @xmath35 exponentially decreases with the increase of the distance @xmath60 .",
    "if the velocity @xmath49 is equal to the velocity @xmath62 , then an abrupt change of the asymptotics type of @xmath35 occurs : instead of being exponential , it becomes power and decreases very slowly with distance :    @xmath63    using the expression  ( [ eq14 ] ) , one can find the velocity of the constant thermal neutron density propagation at large distances from the cylinder butt .",
    "supposing @xmath64 , we seek for the solution for the velocity @xmath65 in the following form :    @xmath66    as a result , we get    @xmath67 , ~~ \\frac{z}{l_0 } \\gg 1 \\label{eq17}\\ ] ]    differentiating  ( [ eq16 ] ) with respect to time @xmath68 , we find the following expression for the instantaneous velocity @xmath69 :    @xmath70    thus , the instantaneous velocity of the constant thermal neutron density propagation in the first order of @xmath71 does not depend on the neutron density @xmath72 and at large distances from the cylinder butt tends asymptotically to @xmath62 ( the velocity of slow nuclear burning in a fissile medium ) . really , in the case of usual slow burning , when a certain temperature is reached as a result of the reaction , the slow burning velocity is proportional to @xmath73 , where @xmath51 is the thermal diffusivity , and @xmath8 is the characteristic time of the reaction  @xcite . in the considered case it is a question of achievement of some fixed neutron density at the given point , caused by multiplication as well as by neutron diffusion . according to the expression  ( [ eq12 ] ) for @xmath62",
    ", the lifetime of a neutron @xmath11 plays the role of a characteristic time of the reaction , while the geometric mean from the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath74  ( [ eq09 ] ) and the effective multiplication coefficient @xmath75  ( [ eq10 ] ) plays the role of the transport factor .    in  @xcite the asymptotics of the neutron density @xmath35 were also considered in two important cases ( of large distances and large time lapses ) , and the following asymptotic expressions were obtained :    * in the case of growing @xmath60 and fixed @xmath68 , i.e. when @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 + @xmath79 * in the case of growing @xmath68 and fixed @xmath60 , i.e. when @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 + @xmath83    the first of the considered cases corresponds to the `` instantaneous '' picture of neutron density distribution over the whole cylinder length , and the second one describes the density evolution at each given fixed point @xmath60 . from the expressions for asymptotics  ( [ eq19 ] ) and  ( [ eq20 ] ) it is clear that at large distances the quantity @xmath35 decreases exponentially with distance , and for large lapses of time for the above - critical mode ( @xmath45 ) it grows up exponentially with time because of multiplication .",
    "it is also clear that for @xmath45 the neutron density grows up with time unlimitedly , and the quantity @xmath84 is a typical time .",
    "this means that in this case the chain reaction of spontaneous fissions under impossibility of neutron and energy removal leads to a system explosion .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , it is necessary , however , to keep in mind that the exponential growth of @xmath35 is related essentially to linearity of the used approximation , and if the nonlinear terms with respect to @xmath35 are taken into account , the growth intensity decreases .",
    "the authors of  @xcite supposed that the neutron density @xmath35 is a finite function , and the velocity of propagation of the burning front is the same as in the linear approximation .    in the case of the subcritical mode @xmath85 , when the number of neutrons , being born during the nuclei fission ,",
    "is not enough for maintaining the spontaneous chain nuclear reaction , the exponents in the expressions  ( [ eq19 ] ) and  ( [ eq20 ] ) are negative and the neutron density decreases with time as well as with the increase of the distance from the cylinder butt . in this case a characteristic length of neutron propagation may be considered .",
    "the quantity @xmath86 represents such length , according to  @xcite . the most important conclusion for us , made in  @xcite as a result of the analysis of behaviour for asymptotics of the solution  ( [ eq11 ] ) for the neutron density @xmath35 and asymptotics with respect to time and the cylinder length  ( [ eq19 ] ) and  ( [ eq20 ] ) , consists in the fact that for the case of the above - critical state of the neutron - multiplication fissile medium , a possible existence of the wave burning , propagating with the constant velocity and practically unchangeable amplitude along the cylinder axis and representing superposition of processes of multiplication and diffusion of neutrons , is demonstrated , and in the case of the subcritical state of the neutron - multiplication fissile medium ,",
    "the neutron process decays .",
    "it is also important , as it is shown in  @xcite , that the wave burning velocity is defined by the formula similar to usual slow burning  @xcite .",
    "the estimate of this wave burning velocity , presented in  @xcite , amounts to @xmath87100  sm / s .",
    "let us also note that the analysis of the asymptotics behaviour with respect to time and the cylinder length showed that for the case of the above - critical state of the neutron - multiplication fissile medium , for the values of velocities of the chain process propagation bigger than the aforesaid wave process velocity , the chain process run - away , i.e. the explosion , begins , and for the values of velocities of the chain process propagation , smaller than the aforesaid wave process velocity , the chain process decays . in  @xcite conditions and criteria , under which the wave burning mode , that may be called an above - critical akhiezer wave of slow nuclear burning , can be realized , are absolutely not investigated , and the only condition , designated in this paper , is the initial above - critical state of the fissile medium for the whole cylinder .",
    "of course , it is also very interesting to investigate the features of this wave kinetics , its stability , the degree of burn - up for fuel medium nuclides , etc .",
    "thus in  @xcite the uranium - plutonium  @xcite and thorium - uranium ( see e.g.  @xcite ) chains of nuclear reactions , underlying slow wave burning ( the slow feoktistov wave ) , on which the whole conception of wave reactors of new generation is based and due to which these reactors have the property of internal safety and allow to use the originally unenriched or slightly enriched media of uranium-238 or thorium-232 as fuel , were not considered . for slow wave nuclear burning , being the subject of the given paper , it is essential that the multiplication fissile uranium - plutonium or thorium - uranium ( or even thorium - uranium - plutonium ) medium was initially in the subcritical state , and as it follows from the results of  @xcite , in this case the wave chain process is not discovered .",
    "let us also note that the velocity of the slow feoktistov wave is several orders of magnitude smaller than the velocity of the akhiezer wave , and therefore the feoktistov wave may be called a wave of ultraslow neutron - nuclear burning .",
    "besides , the burning region in the feoktistov wave passes temporarily into the above - critical state as a result of accumulation of the fissile nuclide ( plutonium-239 or uranium-233 for the thorium - uranium cycle , or both simultaneously ) , and after that the total process of multiplication and diffusion of neutrons , apparently , becomes similar to the chain neutron process , considered in  @xcite , however , here the differences are also noticeable , since in the case of the feoktistov wave this supercriticality is local , and for the above - critical akhiezer wave supercriticality is set initially for the whole cylinder of the fissile medium .",
    "it is natural to note that feoktistov and akhiezer criteria of the wave burning realization , as it follows from the present paper , differ essentially , that also indicates that these wave processes are different .    in connection with the aforesaid it is interesting to conduct the following computer modelling experiment : in the cylindrical uranium ( or uranium - plutonium ) neutron - multiplication medium ,",
    "being in the above - critical state with respect to uranium-235 ( or plutonium-239 ) , with the help of the permanent external neutron source to initiate the akhiezer burning wave ( the wave of uranium-235 burning ) , after run of which along the cylinder by the condition of non - hundred - percent burn - up of uranium-238 ( we make this stipulation because the kinetics of the akhiezer wave is not studied for the time being ) after some time , typical for lighting of the feoktistov wave , the external neutron source will initiate the feoktistov wave , which will also propagate along the cylinder .",
    "of course , conditions of such a computer experiment must be agreed with criteria of existence of these wave processes , and first of all with respect to neutron energies . in this connection",
    "let us note that from physical considerations it is clear that the akhiezer wave by the corresponding initial enrichment with respect to the fissile nuclide , ensuring the above - critical state of the fissile medium , can be realized not only for thermal neutrons , as considered in  @xcite , but also for other neutron energies , e.g. for fast neutrons .",
    "this is also confirmed by the fact that the used in  @xcite equation for thermal neutrons in the one - group diffusion - age approximation can be also generalized for other neutron energies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a similar computer experiment may be conducted also for thorium - uranium or thorium - uranium - plutonium fissile media . )",
    "in  @xcite for the uranium - plutonium medium under a number of simplifications of the kinetic system of equations for the considered process ( the one - dimensional medium and the fixed neutron energy ( the one - group approximation ) are considered , the neutron diffusion is not taken into account , the kinetic equation for plutonium-239 is written assuming that uranium-238 turns directly into plutonium-239 with some typical time of the @xmath88-transition @xmath89 , delayed neutrons and the fissile medium temperature are not taken into account ) the following expressions for the equilibrium concentration @xmath90 of the fissile nuclide @xmath5 and its critical concentration @xmath91 are obtained :    @xmath92    @xmath93    where @xmath94 , @xmath24 , @xmath95 are micro - cross - sections of the neutron radiative capture reactions , fission and neutron absorption , respectively , for the @xmath23 nuclide of the fissile medium ; @xmath89 is a typical time for two @xmath88-decays , transforming @xmath96 ( arising under the radiation capture of neutrons by uranium @xmath97 ) into @xmath98 , and @xmath98 into @xmath5 ; @xmath22 and @xmath99 represent average numbers of neutrons being born as a result of fission of one nucleus of the one @xmath23 nuclide and @xmath5 , respectively .    in the figures",
    "[ fig:01 ] and  [ fig:02 ] the dependences of the cross - sections of nuclear reactions of fission and radiative capture on the energy of neutrons are given . in these figures",

    "the results of the calculations are presented in figures  [ fig:03 ]    [ fig:05 ] .",

    "let us note that in  ( [ eq21 ] ) and  ( [ eq22 ] ) the arguments , on which the concentrations of the nuclides must depend , are not shown explicitly , since we consider kinetics of the system of neutrons and nuclides , and the arguments , on which the cross - sections depend , are also not shown , and therefore one has the impression that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are constants .",
    "however , this simplification has reasonable explanation . in  @xcite the idea of a possibility of the nuclear burning wave existence itself was grounded , and at least approximate estimates , confirming this at least for particular cases of equilibrium @xmath90 and critical @xmath91 concentrations of @xmath104 were necessary . the author of  @xcite , apparently , reasoned in the following way : since the concentration of uranium-238 in the local region of the fissile medium for the system considered in  @xcite , being the closest to the external neutron source , only decreases from the initial concentration 100% with the lapse of time , the maximum value of the estimate of the equilibrium concentration of plutonium-239 , according to  ( [ eq21 ] ) ( where the cross - sections are constants for the fixed neutron energy ) , must be obtained exactly for this initial maximum concentration of uranium-238 . at the same time",
    "the concentration of plutonium-239 in the same local region grows from zero to its maximum value with the lapse of time . as mentioned above , according to the feoktistov criterion , the relationship @xmath105 must hold true for the appearance of the nuclear burning wave , therefore , if this relationship does not hold true for the initial concentration of uranium-238 , it will not hold true according to  ( [ eq21 ] ) later as well , and in such a system a nuclear burning wave should not exist .",
    "obviously , therefore in  @xcite with the help of the expressions  ( [ eq21 ] ) and  ( [ eq22 ] ) for the fixed concentration of uranium-238 , being equal to 100% ( engineering uranium ) , for two fixed neutron energies ( 1  mev for fast and 0.025  ev for thermal neutrons ) estimations were made , demonstrating the fulfilment of the feoktistov criterion for fast neutrons and , consequently , also a possibility of existence of a nuclear burning wave for a fast uranium - plutonium reactor and its impossibility for a slow uranium - plutonium reactor .",
    "however , as said above , everything is much more complicated in reality .",
    "taking into account the real neutron spectrum in the fissile medium and introducing the probability function of the neutron distribution over the energy spectrum @xmath106 , for this function we can write down the formula    @xmath107    where the total neutron density flux reads @xmath108 .",

    "practically in the whole this region of neutron energies 1.8@xmath06.0  ev the feoktistov s criterion holds true , and so does the generalized over the neutron spectrum criterion .",

    "let us also note that the equilibrium concentration , calculated by means of the approximate expression  ( [ eq21 ] ) , does not take into account the possibility of the initial enrichment of the uranium-238 dioxide by uranium-235 and therefore does not change under different enrichments with respect to uranium-235 .",
    "it is important to note that the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:07 ] demonstrate the division of the considered neutron energy region into energy regions , where the akhiezer mode of slow burning is realized ( the regions , where the estimate of the critical concentration of plutonium-239 is negative , e.g. as already mentioned above for natural uranium ( the enrichment 0.71% with respect to uranium-235 ) , the region of neutron energies less than 1.8  ev ) and energy regions , where the feoktistov mode of ultraslow burning is realized ( the regions , where the estimate of the critical concentration of plutonium-239 is positive and the feoktistov criterion holds true , e.g. as already mentioned above for the natural uranium , the region of neutron energies less than 1.8@xmath06.0  ev ) for the given compositions of the fissile medium . in fig .",

    "thus , as it follows from the above - stated in this section , in a heavy - water natural uranium reactor there is no region , where the critical plutonium concentration is positive , and consequently , the mode of slow wave neutron - nuclear burning of plutonium-239 can not be realized .",
    "the same is true for the natural uranium reactors with a gas coolant . in these reactors slow",
    "wave nuclear burning is possible for fuel with so lesser enrichment with respect to uranium-235 , that in the thermal energy region the plutonium-239 criticality region exists ( the estimate of the critical concentration of plutonium-239 is positive ) .",
    "for example , uranium-238 dioxide with the enrichment 0.50% with respect to uranium-235 ( see fig .  [ fig:11 ] ) or with even lesser enrichment , or engineering uranium , or spent nuclear fuel , satisfying this condition , will do .",
    "and light - water thermal reactors with natural uranium fuel will right do for slow wave burning of plutonium-239 , since natural uranium in them , as is well known , is in the subcritical state , and exactly because of this the additional enrichment of fuel 2.0%@xmath03.5% with respect to uranium-235 is required for such reactors operation .",
    "in order to confirm the validity of the afore - cited estimates and conclusions , based on the analysis of the slow wave neutron - nuclear burning criterion fulfilment depending on the neutron energy , the numerical modelling of neutron - nuclear burning in natural uranium within the epithermal region of neutron energy ( 0.1@xmath07.0  ev ) was carried out .",

    "according to the theory of a soliton - like neutron wave of slow nuclear burning , developed on basis of the theory of quantum chaos in  @xcite , the velocities of neutron - nuclear burning must satisfy the wigner distribution .",
    "the phase velocity @xmath52 of the soliton - like neutron wave of nuclear burning is determined by the following approximate equality :    @xmath231    where @xmath232 is a dimensionless invariant , depending on the parameter @xmath233 ; @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the equilibrium and critical concentrations of @xmath104 , @xmath234 is the mean free path of neutrons , @xmath89 is the delay time , connected with birth of an active ( fissile ) isotope and equal to the effective period of the @xmath88-decay of compound nuclei in the feoktistov uranium - plutonium cycle .    for the purpose of checking the velocity of slow neutron - nuclear burning of natural uranium in the epithermal region of energies of neutrons ( 1.0@xmath07.0  ev ) , obtained during numerical modelling",
    ", the corresponding equilibrium and critical concentrations for plutonium-239 were calculated according to the expressions  ( [ eq28 ] ) and  ( [ eq29 ] ) , and with their help , using the relationship  ( [ eq52 ] ) , the estimates of the parameter @xmath235 and the invariant @xmath236 were made .    in order to calculate the equilibrium and critical concentrations for plutonium-239 according to the expressions  ( [ eq28 ] ) and  ( [ eq29 ] ) , for the epithermal region of neutron energies ( 1.0@xmath07.0  ev ) we preliminarily calculated the cross - sections of neutron - nuclear reactions averaged over the neutron energy spectrum , present in the expressions  ( [ eq28 ] ) and  ( [ eq29 ] ) .",
    "the averaging of the neutron - nuclear reactions cross - sections in the epithermal region of neutron energies ( 1.0@xmath07.0  ev ) was carried out over the neutron spectrum , obtained from the spectrum of wwer neutrons , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:06 ] , by such its displacement to the epithermal region that the maximum of the neutrons spectrum corresponded to their energy of 3  ev .",
    "the following values were obtained :    @xmath237    the obtained estimates of the parameter @xmath233 and the invariant @xmath236 for slow neutron - nuclear burning of the natural uranium in the epithermal region of neutron energies ( 1.0@xmath07.0  ev ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] .    at the same time",
    "the estimate of the phase velocity of neutron - nuclear burning of natural uranium in the epithermal region of neutron energies , obtained by means of the numerical modelling results presented in section  [ sec05 ] ( see e.g. fig .  [ fig:12 ] ) is approximately equal to    @xmath238    the mean free path for neutrons of the indicated epithermal energy region is equal to    @xmath239    here it should be noted that in the previous expression  ( [ eq54 ] ) for the estimation of the averaged free path for neutrons we used the value of the radiation capture cross - section for uranium-239 instead of the radiation capture cross - section for uranium-238 , since under the set neutron flux density uranium-238 changes to uranium-239 in a very short time as a result of the neutron radiative capture reaction .     on the parameter @xmath233 , presented in  @xcite and supplemented with an estimate , obtained in the present paper for slow wave burning of natural uranium in the epithermal region of the neutrons energy ( 1.0@xmath07.0  ev).,width=377 ]    thus , on basis of the numerical modeling results we get the following estimate of the invariant of nuclear burning :    @xmath240    the estimate of @xmath241 can be also obtained from the expression  ( [ eq30 ] ) if the values of the invariant @xmath242 presented in  ( [ eq53 ] ) and @xmath89 are known . indeed , according to  ( [ eq52 ] ) we obtain    @xmath243    the comparison of the values  ( [ eq56 ] ) and  ( [ eq57 ] ) allows to draw a conclusion about their good agreement .",
    "the difference between the value of the invariant  ( [ eq56 ] ) , obtained from the results of numerical modelling , and the theoretical estimate  ( [ eq57 ] ) can be caused by the fact that we used the one - group diffusion approximation of the neutron transport theory for the numerical modelling .",
    "owing to this , we set the values of the neutron - nuclear reactions cross - sections  ( [ eq51 ] ) , obtained by averaging over the range of epithermal energies ( 0.1@xmath07.0  ev ) for the input data without taking into account the form of the neutron energy spectrum .",
    "we set the values corresponding to the energy of 1  ev for the diffusion coefficient and the neutron velocity .",
    "it should be noted that the decrease of the plutonium wave burning velocity in the second modelling calculation in comparison with the first one , caused by the increase of the effective cross - section of the neutron radiation capture for fragments of fission and `` slags '' by an order of magnitude , agrees well with the expression for the phase velocity of wave burning set by the wigner distribution  ( [ eq52 ] ) and the expressions  ( [ eq28 ] ) and  ( [ eq29 ] ) ( or the similar ones  ( [ eq21 ] ) and  ( [ eq22 ] ) ) for the equilibrium and critical plutonium concentrations .",
    "the increase of the effective cross - section of neutron radiation capture for fragments of fission and `` slags '' , according to the expression  ( [ eq28 ] ) , does not change the estimate for the equilibrium plutonium concentration and , according to the expression  ( [ eq29 ] ) , leads to the increase of the first term in the numerator of the expression  ( [ eq29 ] ) , leading to the increase of the estimate for the critical plutonium concentration .",
    "the increase of the critical plutonium concentration for the constant equilibrium plutonium concentration and under fulfilment of the burning condition @xmath244 , according to the expression  ( [ eq52 ] ) for the parameter @xmath233 , leads to its increase , since the numerator grows up while the denominator goes down , and such parameter increase causes the decrease of the phase velocity of plutonium wave burning also according to the expression  ( [ eq52 ] ) .",
    "a general criterion of the wave modes of neutron - nuclear burning realization for both akhiezer and feoktistov waves is formulated for the first time .",
    "the investigation of the wave burning criterion fulfilment for a fissile medium originally consisting of uranium-238 in a wide range of neutron energies is conducted for the first time .",
    "the possibility of the wave nuclear burning not only in the region of fast neutrons , but also for cold , epithermal and resonance ones is also discovered for the first time .    the results of the investigation of the feoktistov criterion fulfilment for a fissile medium , originally consisting of uranium-238 dioxide with enrichments 4.38% , 2.00% , 1.00% , 0.71% and 0.50% with respect to uranium-235 , in the region of neutron energies 0.015@xmath010.00",
    "ev are presented for the first time .",
    "these results indicate a possibility of the ultraslow wave neutron - nuclear burning of the uranium - plutonium media , originally ( before the wave mode initiation with some external neutron source ) having enrichments with respect to uranium-235 , corresponding to the subcritical state , in the regions of cold , thermal , epithermal and resonance neutrons .    in order to confirm the validity of the conclusions based on the analysis of the slow wave neutron - nuclear burning criterion fulfilment depending on the neutron energy , the numerical modelling of the ultraslow wave neutron - nuclear burning in the natural uranium within the epithermal region of neutron energies ( 0.1@xmath07.0  ev ) was conducted for the first time .",
    "the presented results of the numerical modelling of such conditions indicate the realization of such a mode .",
    "a conclusion about the possibility of creating the thermal - epithermal wave nuclear reactor in which a natural uranium in its various forms can be used as fuel , substantiated by the calculations results , is made for the first time .",
    "we also make a conclusion that light - water thermal reactors with natural uranium fuel are appropriate for slow wave burning of plutonium-239 . in a heavy - water natural uranium reactor",
    "there is no region , where the critical plutonium concentration is positive and , consequently , the mode of slow wave neutron - nuclear burning ( the feoktistov wave ) can not be realized .",
    "the same is true for the natural uranium reactors with a gas coolant . in these reactors slow",
    "wave nuclear burning is possible for fuel with so small enrichment with respect to uranium-235 , that in the thermal energy region the plutonium-239 criticality region exists .",
    "for example , engineering uranium or already spent nuclear fuel with appropriate burn - up will do .",
    "thus we make the conclusion about a possibility of creation of wave nuclear reactors on cold , thermal , epithermal and resonance neutrons , and not only on fast neutrons for the first time , which is substantiated by the corresponding calculations .",
    "it is extremely important for a number of reasons , the major ones of which are the following .",
    "first , the problem of materials radiation resistance , being topical for fast wave reactors  @xcite , is resolved automatically , since the neutron energy is smaller by approximately six orders ( from @xmath871  mev to @xmath871  ev ) and , consequently , the integral fluence on the material of the fuel element walls also much smaller .",
    "however , we would like to draw attention to the fact that , as it follows from the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:05 ] , the wave burning criterion holds true not only for fast reactors with the hard spectrum ( the average neutron energy @xmath871  mev ) , but also for fast reactors with the softened neutron spectrum ( the average neutron energy less then @xmath87100  kev , and a `` tail '' of the neutron spectrum with the energy less than 10  kev is rather large , see e.g.  @xcite ) . and",
    "the solution of the problem of the materials radiation resistance , essential for fast wave reactors with the hard neutron spectrum , requires creation of new structural materials for the fuel element walls , withstanding the radiation load of 500  dpa ( displacement per atom ) , whereas the materials operating nowadays withstand @xmath87100  dpa ( see  @xcite ) , i.e. the increase of radiation resistance in five times is necessary .",
    "therefore , perhaps , it will be possible to solve the existing problem of radiation resistance of materials for fast wave reactors with the hard neutron spectrum by creating the fast wave reactors with the softened neutron spectrum , since the transition to such reactors reduces the radiation load by an order .",
    "let us also note that the prohibition on usage of steel as a constructional material of the active zone and necessity of use the expensive aluminium and zirconium alloys instead , which takes place for usual thermal reactors operating in the aforesaid ranges of neutron energies , do not exist for the wave reactors , since there is no need to preserve the neutrons for maintaining the chain reaction in wave reactors .",
    "consequently , a possibility to exclude the danger of zirconium - steam reaction with the subsequent explosion of the hydrogen mixture  @xcite appears .",
    "second , the wave reactors on resonance neutrons can act as the transmutators of the nuclides most dangerous for biosphere , being fragments of the fuel nuclides fissions ( the so - called biocompatibility of the nuclear reactor of new generation ) .",
    "third , the realization of the reactors on cold neutrons simplifies their radiation protection seriously because of small penetrability of the neutrons with these energies , which in combination with internal safety of the wave reactors can ensure their wide spread adoption .",
    "fourth , a possibility of the wave reactor realization in the epithermal neutron region ( the maximum of neutron distribution of the maxwellian type in the region from 3  ev to 7  ev ) attracts profound interest , since the requirements for the flux density of the external neutron source , ensuring the lighting of the nuclear burning , decrease sharply in this case ( approximately by three - four orders ) .",
    "this is also true for the lighting times , because of the presence of the radiation capture cross - section maximum for uranium-238 of the order of 10000  barn for the neutron energy 7  ev .",
    "a source with natural radioactivity of neutrons with the energy 7  ev could be such a source , as well as the accelerator of charged particles ( e.g. protons or electrons ) , which create mainly neutrons with the energy 7  ev by interaction with the target nuclei as a result of the nuclear reaction .",
    "let us note that wave nuclear burning in the epithermal region of neutron energies is of serious interest also for investigation of the possible burning modes of the wave georeactor  @xcite , since the epithermal region of neutron energies with the distribution maximum for neutrons of maxwellian type in the region @xmath871  ev can be considered as a region of thermalized neutrons in the fissile uranium - plutonium medium , being in a state with the temperature @xmath875000  k , which corresponds to the temperature of nuclear burning of the georeactor at the interface of the solid and liquid earth cores .",
