    "if spatial modes of the fundamental field are uniformly excited by a spectrally broad pumping , several individual nonlinear processes typically occur in the waveguide and contribute to the sh spectrum . as a consequence ,",
    "the expected sh intensity spectrum is relatively broad ( see fig .  [",

    "as sh spectra belonging to individual processes are relatively wide and close to each other , only spectral filtering of the sh field itself is not sufficient to distinguish them .",
    "after spectral filtering , individual processes become experimentally available by exciting only specific spatial modes in the fundamental beam .",
    "technically , the proper excitation of the chosen spatial mode(s ) is accomplished by suitable coupling of the pump beam into the waveguide .     observed in an ideal ( red curve ) and real ( blue curve ) structure .",
    "individual combinations of spatial modes are identified . ]",

    "the comparison of theoretical and experimental parameters in table  [ tab2 ] has revealed good agreement in central wavelengths of the sh lines .",
    "larger differences between the theoretical and experimental relative powers @xmath147 can be explained by the difficulties in reaching an efficient coupling of the corresponding pump mode .",

    "these graphs document real capabilities in controlling spatial properties of the sh beam .",
    "if the analyzed waveguide were used for parametric down - conversion , several individual processes based on different spatial modes would simultaneously occur contributing together to the signal and idler fields profiles [ e.g. , parametric processes ( 0,0 ) @xmath119 ( 0,0 ) + ( 0,0 ) and ( 0,0 ) @xmath119 ( 0,1 ) + ( 0,1 ) ] .",

    "the process of second harmonic generation in a periodically - poled ktp waveguide has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "three types of the nonlinear processes ( type  ii , i , and 0 ) have been observed simultaneously utilizing the first , second and third harmonics of the spatial nonlinear modulation . a scalar finite elements method based on the galerkin method",
    "has been applied to calculate spatial mode profiles , propagation constants , and frequencies of the interacting fields .",
