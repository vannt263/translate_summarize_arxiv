    "@xmath6 @xmath3 events have been collected with the upgraded bejing spectrometer ( bes ii ) at beijing electron positron collider ( bepc ) , and several billions @xmath3 events will be collected with the proposed bes iii at bepc ii and cleo - c at modified cornell electron storage ring ( cesr)@xcite . furthermore , about @xmath7 @xmath8 resonance data are planned to be taken at cleo iii in the year prior to conversion to low energy operation ( cleo - c)@xcite . with these data samples various decay modes of @xmath3 and @xmath9 resonances can be studied with high statistics . in this paper",
    "we propose to study the exclusive decay of @xmath5 quarkonia and @xmath2 into a lepton pair and a pion pair .",
    "we consider two limited cases in the kinematic region .",
    "one is specified by the pion pair having a large total momentum and a small invariant mass . in this case , the pions are hard . the other is specified that the pion pair having a small momentum , i.e. , the pions are soft . in these",
    "decays the two pion system is produced through conversion of gluons into the two pions . because of isospin symmetry conversion of gluons into one pion is highly suppressed . in a two - pion system",
    "the two pions can be in an isospin singlet , the conversion is allowed .",
    "hence these decays will provide valuable information how unobservable gluons , as dynamical degrees of freedoms of qcd , are converted into observable hadrons .    in the case",
    "that two - pion system has an invariant mass @xmath10 which is much smaller than the mass of heavy meson and has a large total momentum , the decay amplitude takes a factorized form in the heavy quark limit , in which the nonperturbative effect related to heavy meson is represented by a non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) matrix element@xcite , and that related to the two pions is represented by a distribution amplitude of two gluons in the isoscalar pion pair which is defined with twist-2 operators .",
    "the two gluons are hard in the kinematical region , their emission rate can be calculated with perturbative qcd .",
    "the same distribution amplitude also appears in the predictions for productions of two pions in exclusive processes @xmath11@xcite , @xmath12@xcite , and the radiative decay of @xmath5 heavy quarkonium@xcite , where the amplitudes can be factorized in certain kinematic region . besides these processes",
    ", the decays studied here will provide another way to study the nonperturbative mechanism of how gluons , which are fundamental dynamical freedoms of qcd , are transmitted into the two pions .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath11 , at the tree - level , only the distribution amplitude of quark appears in the scattering amplitude , the distribution amplitude of gluon appears at loop levels or through evolution of distribution amplitudes@xcite , while for @xmath12 , at the tree - level , the distribution amplitude of quark as well as that of gluon contribute to the scattering amplitude , but the produced charged pion pair is dominantly in an isospin @xmath13 state@xcite .",
    "this may make it difficult to extract the distribution amplitude of gluon from corresponding experimental data , because the two pions produced through gluon conversion are in a @xmath14 state . for the decays studied in this paper and the radiative decay of @xmath5 heavy quarknonium to two pions@xcite",
    ", only the distribution amplitude of gluon appears at the tree - level and the produced two pions are dominantly in a @xmath14 state .",
    "this makes the extraction of gluon content of a two - pion system relatively easier in experiment .",
    "of course , comparing with the radiative decay of @xmath5 heavy quarkonium into two pions in the same kinematic region , the leptonic decay of @xmath5 heavy quarkonium to two pions is suppressed by the fine structure constant @xmath15 , but the final state in the latter case is more clearer and can be detected with higher efficiency . with the model for the distribution amplitude of gluon , developed in @xcite , we obtain numerical predictions for the branch ratio of the decay in the considered kinematic region .",
    "our results show that the decay mode of @xmath3 in the considered kinematic region is certainly observable at bes ii and the proposed bes iii and cleo - c . for",
    "other decays the branching ratios may be too small to be measured .    in the case with tow",
    "soft pions , it has been shown that the decay amplitude of @xmath0 and of @xmath1 also takes a factorized form in the heavy quark limit@xcite . in the decay amplitude ,",
    "the nonperturbative effect related to heavy quarkonium and that related to pion pair can be separated , the former is still represented by a nrqcd matrix element , while the later is represented by a matrix element of a correlator of electric chromofields which characterizes soft gluons transition into the pion pair .",
    "this result is nonperturbative . for @xmath2 decay",
    "one can generalize the approach and obtain a factorized form for the decay amplitude , where the same correlator appears .",
    "since the matrix element of the correlator of electric chromofields between the vacuum state and the two - pion state is unknown , no numerical prediction of the decay is given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we develop a model for the matrix element of the correlator of electric chromofields and give numerical predictions for the leptonic decays @xmath16 and @xmath2 into a soft pion pair .",
    "numerical results are obtained in the considered region of kinematics and show that the decay mode of @xmath3 is observable at bes ii and at the proposed bes iii and cleo - c .",
    "the paper is organized as the following : in sec .",
    "2 we study the decays of @xmath3 and @xmath17 into two hard pions combined with a lepton pair , where we give a detailed derivation of the factorized amplitude of the decay .",
