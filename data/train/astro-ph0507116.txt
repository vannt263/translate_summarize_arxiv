    "the isotropic expansion of the universe , the primordial abundance of light elements , and the nearly uniform cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) constitute the main observational pillars of the standard friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) model , which provides a very successful description of the universe . in this flrw cosmological context",
    ", recent observations of high redshift type ia supernovae ( snia ) suggest that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion .",
    "this picture is further strengthened by the combination of recent cmbr observations ( which imply that the total density @xmath1 is close or equal to unity ) and the value @xmath2 for the density of clustered ( baryonic plus dark ) matter obtained from the @xmath3-ray emission in rich clusters of galaxies , and from galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "this diverse set of observations has led to an evolving consensus among cosmologists that the universe is smoothly permeated by a negative - pressure dark energy ( de ) component  @xcite , which dominates the matter - energy of the universe today ( @xmath4 ) , although it must have been negligible in the past so as to permit structure formation .",
    "the nature of both dark matter ( dm ) and de is still object of intense investigations today .",
    "there are some candidates for dm from particle physics , but yet no evidence of these suggested particles has been found in laboratory experiments  @xcite . regarding de",
    "there seems to exist no natural candidate from particle physics .",
    "thus , the current observational information regarding dm and de arises only from astro - cosmological observations .",
    "in addition to the cosmological constant and a dynamical scalar field ( quintessence ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the current paradigms for de include a number of possibilities ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , among which the so - called generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg )  @xcite , which unifies dm and de in a single matter - energy component , acting as cold dark matter ( cdm ) at high redshifts and driving the accelerated expansion today .",
    "the behavior of the gcg in the framework of dm and de unification was extensively discussed in the literature ( see , for instance , refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "somewhat parallel to these developments , and owing to the fact that general relativity as a local metrical theory leaves undetermined the space - time topology , a great deal of work has also recently gone into studying the possibility that the universe may possess compact spatial sections with a non - trivial topology . on the one hand , methods and indicators",
    "have been devised to search for topological signs of a possible non - trivial topology of our @xmath5-space @xmath6 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , and also the review articles  @xcite and  @xcite ) . on the other hand , the reported non - gaussianity in cmbr maps  @xcite , the small power of large - angle fluctuations  @xcite , and some features in the power spectrum  @xcite are large - scale anomalies which have been suggested as a potential indication of a non - trivial topology of the universe . in this regard the poincar dodecahedron space  @xcite has been suggested as an explanation for the weak wide - angle temperature correlation in high precision cmbr data  @xcite .",
    "however , preliminary results  @xcite , using wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data , failed to find the six pairs of matched circles of angular radius of about @xmath7 predicted by the poincar space model  @xcite . in this regard",

    "the immediate observational consequence of a multiply connected @xmath5-space section @xmath6 of the universe is the existence of multiple images of radiating sources : discrete cosmic objects or cmbr from the last scattering surface .",
    "however , for these repetitions to be detected the observable horizon radius @xmath8 has to exceed at least the smallest characteristic size @xmath9 of the @xmath5-space @xmath6 . in this way , the question of detectability of cosmic ( space ) topology naturally arises .",
    "this question has been recently studied in the light of current astro - cosmological observations , which indicate that our universe is nearly flat ( @xmath0 ; see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the extent to which a number of non - trivial topologies may or may not be detected for the current bounds on the cosmological density parameters has been determined in a few articles  .    these studies have concentrated in the @xmath10cdm framework , where the cold dark ( and baryonic ) matter plus a cosmological constant ( @xmath10 ) are the matter - energy constituents . in a recent article  @xcite the detectability of cosmic topology of low curvature universes ( @xmath0 ) has been discussed in the unified dm and de gcg context .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to address the detectability of cosmic topology inverse problem , i.e. to investigate the extent to which the detection of a non - trivial nearly flat ( @xmath0 ) topology may constrain models for the matter - energy content of the universe . to this end",
    ", we shall focus our attention on the gcg model and derive bounds set on its two free parameters from the detection of several possible compact topologies .",
    "we also consider the combination of the bounds from the topology detection with the limits on the gcg parameters which arise from current data from 194 snia .",
    "it is found that detection of a nontrivial topology ( through cmbr pattern repetitions ) sets complementary limits to those obtained from snia data . in particular , the detection of some specific manifolds taken together with current snia data may place constraints comparable to those expected from space based experiments ( such as the supernovae acceleration probe ) .    we also show that besides limiting the gcg parameters , the detection of a nontrivial topology allows to set bounds on the total density parameter @xmath1 , which are shown to be further constrained by the combination of topology detection with the current snia data .",
    "such bounds on @xmath1 can be confronted with the values which arise from some topology detection methods ( such as the circles in - the - sky  @xcite ) in order to have further limits on the gcg parameters .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give a brief account of the detectability of cosmic topology basic context and review a few topological results regarding the @xmath5-manifolds , which will be used in the following sections .",
    "focusing on the gcg as a matter content model , we discuss in section  [ detectinver ] the cosmic topology inverse problem and set bounds on the gcg parameters from the possible detection of several compact topologies .",
    "the combination of cosmic topology detection with current snia data and its implications for constraining the gcg parameters and @xmath1 are discussed in section  [ combsnia ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusion ] we discuss our main results and present some concluding remarks .",
    "a few details of the supernovae analysis are discussed in the appendix .",
    "to make the article as clear and self - contained as possible , in this section we shall present the cosmic topology basic context , state the detectability condition , and recall some topological properties of @xmath5-manifolds which will be used in the following sections .    within the framework of the standard flrw cosmology ,",
    "the universe is modeled by a @xmath11-manifold @xmath12 which is decomposed into @xmath13 , and is endowed with a locally isotropic and homogeneous robertson  walker ( rw ) metric @xmath14 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , or @xmath17 depending on the sign of the constant spatial curvature ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19 is the scale factor .",
    "the spatial section @xmath6 is usually taken to be one of the following simply - connected spaces : euclidean @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , spherical @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , or hyperbolic @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) spaces .",
    "however , since geometry does not dictate topology , the @xmath5-space @xmath6 may equally well be any one of the possible quotient ( multiply connected ) manifolds @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a discrete and fixed point - free group of isometries of the covering space @xmath28 . in forming the quotient manifolds",
    "@xmath6 the essential point is that they are obtained from @xmath29 by identifying points which are equivalent under the action of the discrete group @xmath27 .",
    "hence , each point on the quotient manifold @xmath6 represents all the equivalent points on the covering manifold @xmath29 .",
    "the action of @xmath27 tessellates ( tiles ) @xmath29 into identical cells or domains which are copies of what is known as fundamental polyhedron ( fp).torus @xmath30 .",
    "the covering space clearly is @xmath31 , and a fp is a rectangle with opposite sides identified .",
    "this fp tiles the covering space @xmath31 .",
    "the group @xmath32 consists of discrete translations associated with the side identifications . ]    in a multiply connected manifold , any two given points may be joined by more than one geodesic . since the radiation emitted by cosmic sources follows ( space - time ) geodesics , the immediate observational consequence of a non - trivial spatial topology of @xmath6 is that the sky may ( potentially ) show multiple images of radiating sources : cosmic objects or specific correlated spots of the cmbr . at large cosmological scales ,",
    "the existence of these multiple images ( or pattern repetitions ) is a physical effect often used to examine the detectability of the @xmath5-space topology .    in order to state the conditions for the detectability of cosmic topology in the context of standard cosmology",
    ", we note that for non - flat metrics of the form  ( [ rwmetric ] ) , the scale factor @xmath19 can be identified with the curvature radius of the spatial section of the universe at time @xmath33 .",
    "therefore @xmath34 is the distance of any point with coordinates @xmath35 to the origin ( in the covering space ) _ in units of the curvature radius _ , which is a natural unit of length that shall be used throughout this paper .",
    "the study of the detectability of a possible non - trivial topology of the spatial section @xmath6 requires a topological typical length which can be put into correspondence with observation survey depths @xmath36 up to a redshift @xmath37 .",
    "a suitable characteristic size of @xmath6 , which we shall use in this paper , is the so - called injectivity radius @xmath9 , which is nothing but the radius of the smallest sphere ` inscribable ' in @xmath6 , and is defined in terms of the length of the smallest closed geodesics @xmath38 by @xmath39 .",
    "now , for a given survey depth @xmath36 a topology is said to be undetectable if @xmath40 . in this case",
    "there are no multiple images ( or pattern repetitions of cmbr spots ) in the survey of depth @xmath36 . on the other hand , when @xmath41 , then the topology is detectable in principle or potentially detectable .    in a globally homogeneous manifold",
    "the above detectability condition holds regardless of the observer s position , and so if the topology is potentially detectable ( or is undetectable ) by an observer at @xmath42 , it is potentially detectable ( or is undetectable ) by an observer at any other point in the @xmath5-space @xmath6 .",
    "however , in globally inhomogeneous manifolds the detectability of cosmic topology depends on both the observer s position @xmath3 and the survey depth @xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless , even for globally inhomogeneous manifolds the above defined ` global ' injectivity radius @xmath9 can be used to state an _",
    "absolute _ undetectability condition , namely @xmath43 .",
    "reciprocally , the condition @xmath44 allows potential detectability ( or detectability in principle ) in the sense that , if this condition holds , multiple images of topological origin are potentially observable at least for some observers suitably located in @xmath6 .",
    "an important point is that for spherical and hyperbolic manifolds , which we focus on in this work , the ` global ' injectivity radius @xmath9 expressed in terms of the curvature radius , is a constant ( topological invariant ) for a given topology .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we shall recall some relevant results about spherical and hyperbolic @xmath5-manifolds , which will be useful in the following sections .",
    "the multiply connected spherical @xmath5-manifolds are of the form @xmath45 , where @xmath27 is a finite subgroup of @xmath46 acting freely on the @xmath5-sphere .",
    "these manifolds were originally classified by threlfall and seifert  @xcite , and are also discussed by wolf  @xcite ( for a description in the context of cosmic topology see  @xcite ) .",
    "such a classification consists essentially in the enumeration of all finite groups @xmath47 , and then in grouping the possible manifolds in classes . in a recent paper , gausmann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite recast the classification in terms of single action , double action , and linked action manifolds . in table",
    "[ singleaction ] we list the single action manifolds together with the symbol often used to refer to them , as well as the order of the covering group @xmath27 and the corresponding injectivity radius .",
    "it is known that single action manifolds are globally homogeneous , and thus the detectability conditions for an observer at an arbitrary point @xmath48 also hold for an observer at any other point @xmath49 .",
    "finally we note that the binary icosahedral group @xmath50 gives the known poincar dodecahedral space , whose fundamental polyhedron is a regular spherical dodecahedron , @xmath51 of which tile the @xmath5-sphere into identical cells which are copies of the fp .",
    ".single action spherical manifolds together with the order of the covering group and the injectivity radius .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     closed orientable hyperbolic @xmath5-manifolds can be constructed from these cusped manifolds .",
    "the compact manifolds are obtained through a so - called dehn surgery which is a formal procedure identified by two coprime integers , i.e. winding numbers @xmath52 .",
    "these manifolds can be constructed and studied with the publicly available software package snappea  @xcite .",
    "snappea names manifolds according to the seed cusped manifold and the winding numbers .",
    "so , for example , the smallest volume hyperbolic manifold known to date ( weeks manifold ) is named as m@xmath53 , where m003 corresponds to a seed cusped manifold , and @xmath54 is a pair of winding numbers .",
    "hodgson and weeks  @xcite have compiled a census containing @xmath55 orientable closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds ordered by increasing volumes . in table",
    "[ 10hw - census ] we collect the first seven manifolds from this census with the lowest volumes , ordered by increasing injectivity radius @xmath9 , together with their volumes .",
    "the detectability of cosmic topology as well as its inverse problem can be said to have two main ingredients , namely one of mixed geometric - and - topological nature , and another which comes from the fact the current astro - cosmological observations allow a set of possible models for the matter - energy content of the universe . as we have discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the former arises from the fact that rw geometry does not dictate the topology of the @xmath5-space @xmath6 , giving rise to a multiplicity of non - trivial topologies for @xmath6 and the possible existence of multiple images of radiating sources .    regarding the second important ingredient",
    ", we shall focus on the gcg unification of dm and de paradigm to concretely illustrate the cosmic topology inverse problem .",
    "in other words , we assume the current matter content of the universe to be given by the ordinary baryonic matter of density @xmath56 plus a generalized chaplygin gas ( with density @xmath57 and pressure @xmath58 ) whose equation of state is given by  @xcite    @xmath59    where the constant @xmath60 has dimension of mass and @xmath61 is a real dimensionless constant .",

    "if one further assumes that these two matter components do not interact , then the energy conservation equation @xmath70 can be integrated separately for the baryonic matter and chaplygin gas , giving the well known result @xmath71 , and @xmath72^{1/(1+\\alpha)},\\ ] ] where @xmath73 , and the index @xmath74 denotes evaluation at present time @xmath75 .",
    "we note that at high redshifts ( @xmath76 ) one has @xmath77 , whereas at late times ( @xmath78 ) one has @xmath79 , making clear that the gcg interpolates between a dust dominated ( cdm ) phase in the past , and a cosmological constant phase in the future .    writing the above expressions for the densities @xmath56 and @xmath57 in terms of the redshift ( @xmath80 )",

    "we have left implicit the dependence of the function @xmath34 on its variables .    for a given survey with",
    "redshift cut - off @xmath94 , the redshift distance function @xmath36 clearly depends on the way one models the matter - energy content of the universe .",
    "so , for example , in the @xmath10cdm context @xmath95 , and therefore the potential detectability ( or the undetectability ) of a given topology depends on these density parameters . similarly , in dealing with the detectability of cosmic topology in the gcg unified framework it is clear from  ( [ chiobsgcg1 ] ) that besides the chaplygin density @xmath84 , one has to consider the gcg model parameters @xmath61 and @xmath96 , assuming we know @xmath97 .",

    "it is clear that , for a fixed value of a variable of the redshift - distance function  ( [ chiobsgcg1 ] ) , equation @xmath104 defines an implicit function of the remaining two parameters , whose graph is a curve in the corresponding parameter plane . in the parameter planes @xmath1@xmath96 and @xmath105@xmath106 for all points above ( below ) a curve solution of  ( [ contcurves ] ) , the topology of the corresponding spherical ( or respectively hyperbolic ) manifold is potentially detectable.@xmath106 plane , for points above the curves solution of ( [ contcurves ] ) , the topology is detectable for both spherical and hyperbolic manifolds .",

    "this clearly illustrates how bounds on a local physical quantity can be imposed by the global topology of the universe . the fact that a possible detection of a nontrivial topology places constraints on @xmath1 was first mentioned in the cosmological context by bernshtein and shvartsman  @xcite , and has been recently dealt with in the @xmath10cdm framework by roukema and luminet  @xcite .",

    "however , for @xmath161 the behavior of @xmath36 is not very sensitive to @xmath61 as can be inferred from the asymptotic values of @xmath36 , whose values are indicated in the figure by small line segments .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath36 changes substantially for @xmath162 , and for universes that are not so nearly flat , i.e. for @xmath163 . as a consequence , for @xmath162",
    "the detectability of cosmic topology , for fixed @xmath154 , is much less likely than in the @xmath10cdm - dominated universe .",
    "we note that the relevant features of this figure do not change significantly for @xmath164 , keeping @xmath158 , of course .",
    "# 1#20.9#1    to close this section we consider some specific manifolds of tables  [ singleaction ] and  [ 10hw - census ] , and focus our attention on the parameter plane @xmath1@xmath106 .",
    "taking again @xmath158 , with @xmath159 , for @xmath160 , and @xmath1 within the previously discussed bounds , we have plotted the curves solution of  ( [ contcurves ] ) for some spherical and hyperbolic manifolds , as shown in figure  [ omegaversusalfa ] . from this figure",
    "we have that the greater the order of the group for the cyclic and binary dihedral families the weaker is the restriction on @xmath61 .",
    "so , for example , for @xmath165 and @xmath166 the detectability of a given topology of these families would set no restriction on the gcg parameter @xmath61 .",
    "an important point that can be inferred from this figure is that if no sign is found of a given topology in the @xmath10cdm framework this does not necessarily mean that such topology is ruled out by observation .",
    "for example , if no sign of either a binary tetrahedron @xmath118 or the weeks manifold m003(-3,1 ) is found in cmbr maps , it can be that @xmath167 such that these topologies are unobservable using pattern repetitions .",
    "finally , if future observations such as the planck  @xcite mission tighten the range of @xmath1 even closer to @xmath134 , as for example @xmath168 , none of the topologies considered in this figure would be detectable , for any value of @xmath61 .",
    "in the preceding section , we have investigated the constraints on the matter content of the universe placed by the detection of a nontrivial topology . very often in cosmology",
    "the measurement of a single observable does not allow to place strong limits on the parameters of a model .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to consider the constraints that could arise from the detection of the topology together with other sets of observational data .",
    "we shall consider in this section the constraints on the gcg parameters which arise from the detection of the cosmic topology combined with the limits imposed by recent supernovae data ( 194 snia from refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "we shall follow a similar procedure as in section  [ detectinver ] , superimposing the @xmath169 curves corresponding to some spherical and hyperbolic manifolds to the regions in the parameter space allowed by supernovae data .    in figure  [ aversusalfasn ]",
    "we display the @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) confidence regions in the @xmath172 parametric plane , for @xmath173 ( left ) and @xmath146 ( right ) , from snia data .",
    "the contours of constant confidence are nearly identical in both cases , since supernovae data are not very sensitive to the total density .",
    "we refer the readers to the appendix for a discussion on how these contours are derived .",
    "the curves solution of @xmath174 are shown for some spherical ( left ) and hyperbolic ( right ) manifolds .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the higher the value of @xmath9 , the tighter are the combined constraints on both @xmath96 and @xmath61 ( recall that only in models whose parameters are above these curves the corresponding topology is detectable ) .",
    "for instance , a detection of the dihedral @xmath175 ( or @xmath176 ) topology , together with the snia constraints , would imply @xmath177 and @xmath178 at @xmath170 confidence level .",
    "this constraint on @xmath61 is of the same order of what would be obtained with the supernovae acceleration probe  @xcite .",
    "the detection of the @xmath175 topology would allow to discard the @xmath10cdm model taking into account current supernovae bounds .",
    "incidentally , this makes clear that a given topology that is undetectable in the @xmath10cdm model ( @xmath179 ) may be detectable for other matter content models , as in the gcg case  @xcite .",
    "the detection of a tetrahedral @xmath118 ( as well as @xmath119 or @xmath120 ) would set the constraints @xmath180 and @xmath181 at @xmath170 confidence level .",
    "the determination of the octahedral topology ( as well as @xmath182 or @xmath183 ) would rule out only high values of @xmath61 ( setting @xmath184 ) . as expected from the discussion of the previous section , for @xmath145 , the poincar dodecahedral does not add limits to the supernovae bounds , nor do the dihedral and cyclic families for @xmath185 and @xmath186 .    # 1#20.9#1    similarly , from the left panel of figure  [ aversusalfasn ] , the detection of the higher @xmath9 manifolds of table  [ 10hw - census ] , namely m@xmath187 , m@xmath188 , and m@xmath53 , would set rather strong constraints on @xmath61 .",
    "the detection of m@xmath133 topology gives rise to the bound @xmath189 , restricting therefore the limits set by supernovae data on this parameter .",
    "as for the topology with the smallest @xmath9 of table  [ 10hw - census ] , m@xmath132 , its detection does not add new bounds to those which arise from supernovae .",
    "let us now investigate what happens when @xmath1 is allowed to vary within the bound @xmath190 for some noteworthy values of @xmath61 .",
    "we shall take the following values for @xmath61 .",
    "first @xmath191 , which is a lower limit set by the combination of several observables assuming a flat universe .",
    "lower limit derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and at @xmath192 in  @xcite . ]",
    "second , @xmath193 , which corresponds to the @xmath10cdm case .",
    "third , @xmath194 , which is the standard chaplygin gas . finally , we shall take @xmath195 , which is approximately the best fit from the supernovae data for fixed @xmath1 in the interval @xmath190 .    in figure  [ omegaversusasn ] ,",
    "the @xmath170 confidence regions from supernovae data for these values of @xmath61 are shown superimposed with the solution of @xmath174 for several manifolds . as expected , the supernovae constraints on @xmath96 are almost independent of @xmath1 within the narrow interval of @xmath1 that we are considering .",
    "therefore , the determination of a nontrivial topology sets no further constraints on @xmath96 than those arising from the supernovae data .",
    "however , knowing the topology , in combination with the supernovae limits , allows to constrain the total density @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath196 , for example , if the tetrahedral @xmath118 ( or @xmath119 , or @xmath120 ) is found to be the cosmic topology , this sets the constraint @xmath197 .",
    "it should be noticed that , according to snia data , a few topologies of tables  [ singleaction ] and  [ 10hw - census ] are already unobservable at @xmath171 ( @xmath170 confidence ) for @xmath198 and @xmath199 , such as @xmath175 , @xmath176 , m@xmath188 , and m@xmath187 .",
    "the @xmath118 topology is undetectable for @xmath200 , while the poincar dodecahedron @xmath201 is detectable for any @xmath61 in the considered range .    for a given spherical topology ,",
    "the greater is @xmath61 the higher is the lower bound on @xmath1 which arises from the detection of the corresponding topology combined with snia data .",
    "thus , e.g. , while for @xmath196 the detection of the tetrahedral @xmath118 sets the bound @xmath197 , for @xmath202 it gives rise to the lower bound @xmath203 .    as far as hyperbolic topologies are concerned , the greater is @xmath61 the smaller is the value for lower bound on @xmath1 which arises from the combination of the topology detection with snia data .",
    "thus , for example , for the manifold m@xmath133 and for @xmath196 and @xmath125 the lower bounds are @xmath204 and @xmath205 , respectively . for smaller @xmath9 manifolds ,",
    "however , such as @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and m@xmath132 , the change of the lower bound on @xmath1 with @xmath61 is not very significative , as can be seen from the figures .",
    "this allows to set constraints which are rather independent of @xmath61 , for these manifolds .",
    "for instance if the topology of the universe is found to be the m@xmath132 manifold , then we must have @xmath208 at @xmath170 confidence level , for any value of @xmath209 .",
    "regardless of our present - day inability to predict the topology of the universe , its detection and determination is ultimately expected to be an observational problem .",
    "the search for topological signs of a nontrivial topology of the universe has become particularly topical .",
    "a finite universe is not only consistent with the main pillars of the flrw cosmological model , but offers a possible explanation for several cmbr anisotopy features which are unexpected in the context of an infinite flat @xmath10cdm model  @xcite . although it is not clear whether evidences of topological pattern repetitions have been found in cmbr anisotropies maps  @xcite , it is expected that we should be able to detect the cosmic topology in the future , given the wealth of increasingly accurate cosmological observations , especially the recent results from the wmap , and the development of new methods and strategies for such a detection .",
    "the detection of a nontrivial cosmic topology would certainly be a major scientific discovery . besides its importance _ per se _",
    ", we have shown in this article that knowledge of the cosmic topology can be used to set bounds on the matter content of the universe . to concretely illustrate this fact ,",
    "we have considered the gcg model for dark matter and dark energy unification and determined the constraints on its parameters that would be obtained from the detection of a number of topologies .",
    "specifically , we have considered the seven smaller volume hyperbolic manifolds and the globally homogeneous spherical manifolds .",
    "we have shown that for @xmath1 within the current observational bounds , the determination of cosmic topology generally sets upper limits on @xmath61 and lower limits on @xmath96 ( see , for example , figures  [ omegaversusa ] and  [ aversusalfa ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the constraints on @xmath61 improve as the allowed interval of @xmath1 narrows , as expected from the forthcoming experiments ( see , e.g. , figure  [ omegaversusalfa ] ) .",
    "also , the higher the injectivity radius @xmath9 , the stronger are the constraints from the detection of the corresponding manifolds through pattern repetitions .",
    "we have also shown that the cosmic topology detection sets additional constraints on the matter content parameters to the bounds that arise from the snia data analysis , by using the gcg parameters as a concrete example . to this end",
    "we have determined the confidence regions in the @xmath96  ",
    "@xmath61 parameter plane from 194 snia for fixed @xmath1 at the extreme values of the current observational bounds , obtained the @xmath170 limits on the @xmath1@xmath96 plane for some physically motivated values of @xmath61 , and combined these limits with the bounds from cosmic topology detection for several spherical and hyperbolic topologies . as a result we found that this combination allows to set stringent constraints on the gcg parameters",
    "thus , for example , the detection of @xmath175 implies @xmath210 and @xmath211 at @xmath170 confidence level , for @xmath145 .",
    "these constraints are stronger than those obtained from any current data based on the background dynamics  @xcite .",
    "clearly , if limits from other sets of observational data are combined with constraints from the determination of the topology , the latter would greatly improve the former bounds .",
    "we found that , besides the gcg parameters , the detection of the topology provides constraints on the total density @xmath1 .",
    "first , the detection of a spherical ( hyperbolic ) topology obviously implies @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "second , for each manifold the topology detection implies a lower ( upper ) bound for spherical ( hyperbolic ) @xmath1 .",
    "finally , the combination of cosmic topology detection with supernovae data further constrains these bounds on @xmath1 , by restricting the allowed interval of @xmath96 for different values of @xmath61 .",
    "the determination of a possible nontrivial cosmic topology is a problem that can be addressed with the current observational data .",
    "several searches have been conducted and more will be carried on in the future .",
    "the fact that the determination of the topology allows to constrain the matter - energy content of the universe provides an extra motivation for this search .",
    "we thank mct and cnpq for the grants under which this work was carried out .",
    "we also thank a.f.f .",
    "teixeira for the reading of the manuscript and indication of relevant misprints and omissions .",

    "empirical studies show that snia can be used as standard candles after light curve calibration ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore , they offer a direct probe of  the luminosity distance - redshift relation , which can be used to constrain theoretical models .",
    "in section  [ combsnia ] we displayed confidence levels on the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath61 of the gcg model obtained from snia data .",
    "to produce such contours , a sample of 253 snia was compiled from references  @xcite and  @xcite which provide tables with the redshift @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and its variance @xmath216 for each supernovae . here",
    "@xmath217 is the luminosity distance times the hubble constant , which is given by @xmath218 where @xmath219 , @xmath220 , or @xmath3 , for @xmath1 greater , smaller or equal to unity , respectively .",
    "the hubble function @xmath221 is given by eq .",
    "( [ hubblefun ] ) and @xmath34 is given by  ( [ chiobsgcg1 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the text , we fix @xmath98 , in agreement with the observed abundances of light elements and measurements of the hubble constant .    following  @xcite and  @xcite we discard local supernovae with @xmath222 , because the peculiar motion contribution to @xmath214 is too high , and those with high host extinction , @xmath223 , which could cause a strong bias in the determination of @xmath217 .",
    "after these cuts , we end up with a sample of @xmath224 snia extending up to @xmath225 . in computing",
    "the chi - squared , we take into account the scatter in @xmath214 caused by peculiar velocities . assuming a velocity dispersion of @xmath226 , we propagate the uncertainty in @xmath214 into the luminosity distance , adding the result in quadrature with the observational uncertainty in @xmath217 . therefore , the chi - squared is given by : @xmath227^{2}}{\\sigma_{\\log\\left (   d_{l}\\left(z_{i}\\right)\\right ) } ^{2}+\\left(\\left.\\frac{\\partial\\log d_{l}^{th}}{\\partial z}\\right\\vert _",

    "to generate the contours displayed in section  [ combsnia ] , we assume that the @xmath170 confidence levels are well approximated by the same value of @xmath228 as for a two - dimensional normal distribution .",
    "that is , we obtain the best fit ( minimum of @xmath229 ) and plot the contour levels of @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "to produce the confidence regions of figure [ aversusalfasn ] , we fixed @xmath145 and @xmath232 for the spherical and hyperbolic universes . the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath61 are allowed to vary , with no priors .",
    "on the other hand , for the graphs of figure  [ omegaversusasn ] we fix @xmath61 at several physically motivated values and leave @xmath1 and @xmath96 totaly free .",
    "the results are shown only for a narrow interval of @xmath1 allowed by a combination of several observables in the context of the @xmath10cdm model , namely @xmath199 .",
    "as far as we know , this is the first time that such analysis is done for the gcg model . by fixing @xmath1 motivated by other non snia data , one is able to obtain stronger limits on @xmath96 and @xmath61 then when @xmath1 is left completely free . as expected , these limits are almost insensitive to @xmath1 in the range @xmath199 , i.e. , they are robust for nearly flat geometries . for fixed @xmath61 ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath96 are almost independent of @xmath1 in the range above , as can be seen in figure  [ omegaversusasn ] [ section  [ combsnia ] ] .",
    "it is clear that snia data alone can not place significative constraints on @xmath1 within that narrow range ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "<S> despite our present - day inability to predict the topology of the universe one may expect that we should be able to detect it in the near future , given the increasing accuracy in the astro - cosmological observations . motivated by this , we examine to what extent a possible detection of a non - trivial topology of a low curvature ( @xmath0 ) universe , suggested by a diverse set of current observations , may be used to place constraints on the matter content of the universe , focusing our attention on the generalized chaplgygin gas ( gcg ) model , which unifies dark matter and dark energy in a single matter component . </S>",
    "<S> we show that besides constraining the gcg free parameters , the detection of a nontrivial topology also allows to set bounds on the total density parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the combination of the bounds from the topology detection with the limits that arise from current data on 194 snia , and show that the determination of a given nontrivial topology sets complementary bounds on the gcg parameters ( and on @xmath1 ) to those obtained from the snia data . </S>"
