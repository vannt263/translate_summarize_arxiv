    "let @xmath16 be a random subset of @xmath9\\times [ n]$ ] obtained by selecting each point @xmath17 with probability @xmath18 , independently of the other points , and let @xmath19 $ ] denote the subgraph of @xmath20 induced by the vertices in @xmath16 .",
    "we write @xmath21 for @xmath19 $ ] , and @xmath22 for the infinite random subgraph of @xmath1 defined in the same way but starting from @xmath2 rather than @xmath9\\times [ n]$ ] .",
    "the model @xmath23 studied in  @xcite was defined on the @xmath7 by @xmath7 torus rather than the grid , but @xmath21 seems more natural in terms of the original motivation . for the results here , it will make no difference which variant we consider .",
    "one interpretation of @xmath21 is as follows : sensors are dropped onto a random selection of crossroads in a regularly laid out city ( or planted forest ) ; two sensors can communicate if they are within distance @xmath3 and the line of sight between them is not blocked by a building ( tree ) .",
    "the graph @xmath21 indicates which pairs of sensors can communicate directly , so we would like to know when @xmath21 has a giant component , and roughly how large it is .",
    "alternatively , taking the point of view of percolation theory , we would like to study percolation in @xmath24 , i.e. , to know for which choices of the parameters @xmath24 has an infinite component .",
    "kolmogorov s 0/1law implies that for each fixed @xmath3 there is a ` critical probability ' @xmath5 such that if @xmath25 then @xmath24 contains an infinite component with probability @xmath26 , while if @xmath27 then with probability @xmath26 all components of @xmath24 are finite .",
    "furthermore , by the ` uniqueness theorem ' of aizenman , kesten and newman  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , when an infinite cluster exists it is unique with probability 1 . among other results ,",
    "frieze , kleinberg , ravi and debany  @xcite proved ( essentially ) that @xmath28 and posed the natural question of determining the value of @xmath29 , assuming it exists .",
    "( in fact , they worked with finite random graphs , as we shall in theorem  [ th_2 ] below . ) here we shall answer this question , proving that @xmath30 as part of the more detailed theorem  [ th_1 ] below .    in homogeneous cases such as this , where the expected degrees of all vertices are equal ,",
    "the critical probability is perhaps more naturally described in terms of the ` critical expected degree ' . since the expected degree of a vertex of @xmath24 is @xmath31 ,",
    "states that the critical expected degree of @xmath24 tends to @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "note that it is too much to hope to find @xmath5 exactly for a given @xmath3 : with @xmath3 fixed , @xmath5 is the critical probability for site percolation on a certain lattice @xmath1 ( non - planar for @xmath34 ) ; the exact values of such critical probabilities are known only in a few very special cases .",
    "indeed , @xmath35 is the critical probability for site percolation on @xmath2 , and even this is not known exactly .",
    "in spirit , theorem  [ th_1 ] and its proof are very close to the arguments given in  @xcite for penrose s spread - out percolation model  @xcite : when @xmath33 with @xmath36 bounded , we can approximate the neighbourhood exploration process in @xmath24 by a certain branching process , and describe the distribution of the small components in this graph in terms of the branching process .",
    "we then show by a rather _ ad hoc _ argument that almost all vertices not in ` small ' components are in a single infinite component .",
    "an analogous assertion holds for @xmath21 and its unique giant component .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , where we could appeal to the general sparse inhomogeneous random graph model of  @xcite , here even the local coupling to the branching process has to be done by hand .",
    "we shall discuss this later .",
    "to state our results precisely , we first define the branching process alluded to above .",

    "in fact , the upper bound on component sizes ( giving the lower bound on the critical expected degree ) , is fairly easy .",
    "the lower bound on component sizes ( giving the upper bound on the critical expected degree ) will be derived in a way that will enable us to prove a finite analogue of theorem  [ th_1 ] , stated as theorem  [ th_2 ] below .    for the upper bound on component sizes we shall prove a much more detailed statement than stated in theorem  [ th_1 ] , namely that @xmath71 for every @xmath0 , @xmath72 and @xmath67 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 denotes the total number of particles in all generations of @xmath46 . for @xmath75 , the branching process",

    "we shall switch between these two parameters as and when convenient .",
    "although our main focus is the infinite random graph @xmath24 , our other aim is to prove a result corresponding to theorem  [ th_1 ] for the finite graphs @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "note that there is a natural coupling in which @xmath21 , defined on the grid , is a subgraph of @xmath23 , defined on the torus .",

    "if we reach @xmath112 while exploring to the right or to the left , the same exploration would also reach @xmath127 , either just after or just before reaching @xmath112 .",
    "this shows that @xmath130 , contradicting our assumptions .    from the remarks above ,",
    "conditional on previous explorations , the number of vertices reached in a horizontal or vertical exploration is stochastically dominated by the @xmath53 distribution .",
    "thus the whole sequence @xmath131 is stochastically dominated by @xmath132 where @xmath133 are the generations of the branching process @xmath46 . since @xmath134",

    "all asymptotic notation refers to this limit .",
    "usually , in showing that the neighbourhood exploration process in some random graph is well approximated by a branching process , one first shows that a given vertex is unlikely to be in a short cycle . here",
    "the latter statement is false : given that @xmath102 is a vertex of @xmath24 , it has probability @xmath137 of being in a triangle of the form @xmath17 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "however , these triangles ( and similar cycles ) have already been accounted for in the construction of the branching process .",
    "if we delete all edges of @xmath24 corresponding to line segments whose interiors contain vertices of @xmath24 , then it is easy to check that the density of short cycles in the resulting graph is very low .",
    "we shall show something more or less equivalent to this statement .",
    "let @xmath78 be fixed .",
    "as before , let us condition on the event that @xmath113 is a vertex of @xmath24 .",
    "we claim that we can couple the first @xmath78 steps @xmath141 of the exploration defined above with the first @xmath78 generations of @xmath142 so that they agree ( in the sense that @xmath143 for @xmath144 ) with probability @xmath94 .",
    "( here the asymptotic notation refers to the limit @xmath33 with @xmath78 and @xmath145 fixed . )",
    "we have already shown that the exploration is stochastically dominated by @xmath46 , where @xmath101 . since @xmath146 , the processes @xmath46 and @xmath142",
    "may be coupled so that their first @xmath78 generations agree whp , so it suffices to ` bound @xmath147 from below ' , i.e. , to couple a subset of this exploration process with @xmath142 so as to agree whp for @xmath78 generations .    in doing so",
    ", we must be careful : suppose that as part of our exploration we find vertices of @xmath59 located as in figure  [ fig_1 ]",
    ". then we are in trouble  since @xmath127 and @xmath148 lie on the same horizontal line , the horizontal explorations from these points will necessarily interfere .",
    "in particular , the expected number of new vertices reached from @xmath127 and @xmath148 together will be significantly less than @xmath149 .",
    "thus , if we reach @xmath127 first , we do not allow ourselves to test the point @xmath148 .    in general , we consider the _ lines _ of @xmath2 , i.e. , the sets of the form @xmath150 or @xmath151 .",
    "initially , we mark all lines as ` unclaimed ' , except the two lines through @xmath115 , which we mark as ` claimed by @xmath115 ' . whenever we find a vertex @xmath152 during a horizontal exploration ,",
    "this vertex immediately claims the vertical line it lies on .",
    "similarly , when we find a vertex @xmath112 during a vertical exploration , @xmath112 claims the horizontal line it lies on .",
    "we modify our exploration as follows : when exploring horizontally or vertically from a vertex @xmath112 , we omit testing any point @xmath127 on a line already claimed by a vertex other than @xmath112 .",
    "this ensures that the same line can not be claimed twice : when we find a vertex @xmath153 by exploring from @xmath112 , exactly one line through @xmath127 has been claimed , namely that joining @xmath112 to @xmath127 ; the vertex @xmath127 then claims the other unclaimed line .    in this modified exploration , a point @xmath17",
    "can only be tested once , so each tested point is present in @xmath24 with ( conditional ) probability @xmath18 .",
    "since the expected number of vertices reached within @xmath78 steps of the exploration is @xmath154 , whp there are at most @xmath155 such vertices , say , and hence at most @xmath156 claimed lines . in each horizontal or vertical exploration",
    ", we are exploring along a claimed line , and we omit testing at most one point on each other claimed line .",
    "thus we omit testing @xmath157 points .",
    "since we would have expected only @xmath158 successes among these tests , omitting them makes essentially no difference : the number @xmath44 of new vertices found may be coupled with a @xmath159 distribution so as to agree with probability @xmath94 .",
    "as we expect to reach @xmath154 vertices during the first @xmath78 steps of our exploration , the sum of these @xmath158 error probabilities is still @xmath158 , so the claim follows .",
    "the truth of the statement ` @xmath160 ' is certainly determined by the numbers @xmath161 .",
    "thus , for every @xmath162 we have @xmath163 as @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath164 it follows that there is some @xmath165 such that @xmath166 since the branching process @xmath142 does not depend on @xmath3 , the right - hand side above is asymptotically @xmath167 . to complete",
    "the proof of it remains to show that @xmath168 in other words , roughly speaking , we must show that almost all vertices of @xmath64 in ` large ' components are in infinite components . as noted in the introduction ,",
    "the probability that there is an infinite component is either 0 or 1 , and when there is an infinite component it is unique with probability 1 , so the remaining assertion of theorem  [ th_1 ] follows .",
    "so far we have coupled the neighbourhood exploration process in @xmath24 with a branching process @xmath142 .",
    "if we keep track of the locations of the points in @xmath169 as well as their number , then the appropriate limit object is a branching random walk .",
    "indeed , let us turn @xmath142 into a branching random walk @xmath170 on @xmath171 ( or , more formally , on @xmath172 ) as follows .",
    "each generation @xmath173 , @xmath52 , will consist of a finite set of points of @xmath171 , each labelled with either ` v ' ( for reached by a vertical step ) or ` h ' ( reached by a horizontal step ) .",
    "a particle of type ` v ' at a point @xmath17 has children in the next generation according to the following rule : generate a poisson process @xmath174 of intensity @xmath175 on @xmath176 . starting from @xmath17 and working to the right , include as children of @xmath17 all points of @xmath174 until the first time that we come to a gap of length greater than @xmath26 .",
    "do the same to the left .",
    "all children have type ` h ' .",
    "the rule for children of particles of type ` h ' is similar , using the line @xmath177 instead .",
    "sometimes we start with two particles at the origin , one of type ` h ' and one of type ` v ' ; we write @xmath178 for this branching random walk . at other times , we consider the same branching rule but start with a single particle , writing @xmath179 . when the starting rule is clear or unimportant ,",
    "we write simply @xmath170 .",
    "since the number of offspring of a particle in @xmath170 is independent of the position of this particle , we may view @xmath178 as our original branching process @xmath142 by simply ignoring the positions of the particles .",
    "it is easy to check that the rules above correspond to a certain limit of the horizontal and vertical explorations we considered earlier , where we take @xmath33 and rescale by dividing the coordinates of our lattice points by @xmath3 . in particular",
    ", the coupling argument above shows that for any fixed @xmath78 , we may couple @xmath180 with the first @xmath78 generations @xmath181 of the branching random walk @xmath178 so that with probability @xmath94 there is exactly one particle @xmath182 for each @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 .",
    "we shall only study the branching random walk @xmath170 in a trivial way , calculating certain expectations ; moreover , we shall avoid all detailed calculations , needing only ` soft ' arguments .",
