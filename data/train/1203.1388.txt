    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are an important phase in the life of intermediate - mass stars .",
    "while their formation is broadly understood , the mechanism(s ) required to create the multitude of central star spectral types and pn morphologies remain unclear . to help address these problems",
    ", we have compiled a volume - limited sample of pne out to 3.0  kpc from the sun , with the ambitious goal of measuring the fundamental properties of every pn and its central star ( cspn ) within that volume .",
    "though not easy to produce , volume - limited samples are fundamental in astronomy , so a complete local pn census is needed to fully understand the galactic disk population and the characteristics of their ionizing stars . surprisingly , there is a lack of consensus over the precise definition of a pn , a situation that lingers even after years of intensive effort ( frew & parker 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "we argue that the ` pn ' term should be restricted to the ionized shell ejected after the agb phase , or via a common - envelope ( ce ) event ( de marco 2009 ) .",
    "we make this point , since in many symbiotic systems , which can be confused with pne , the ionized gas derives from a companion star , and not from the precursor of the white dwarf ( wd ) that is usually present in these systems , and whose own pn has faded .",
    "there is a great deal of variation in the chemical compositions and effective temperatures , and hence spectral types , of nearby cspne .",
    "about 20% are h - deficient , including those where wolf - rayet features are present .",
    "almost all belong to the [ wc][wo ] sequence , though recent discoveries are altering this paradigm .",
    "the variable [ wn4.5 ] nucleus of n  66 , a peculiar pn in the lmc ( pea et al .",
    "1995 ) , may be the product of an exotic binary evolution channel ( hamann et al . 2003 ; lepo & van kerkwijk 2012 ) .",
    "certainly , its point - symmetric morphology ( fig .",
    "1 ) is similar to known post - ce pne ( e.g. miszalski et al . 2009 ) .",
    "closer to home , the faint nebula abell  48 may host the first galactic h - deficient [ wn ] star ( depew et al .",
    "2011 ; frew et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) , since phr  1619 - 4913 ( morgan et al . 2003 ) is probably a ring nebula around the massive wn star pmr  5 ( todt et al .",
    "in addition , a [ wn / wc ] class has been proposed with pb  8 as the archetype ( todt et al .",
    "2010a , b ) .",
    "there are three more candidate [ wn / wc ] stars ( parker & morgan 2003 ; parker et al .",
    ", in prep . ) that we are following up , but their origin is currently unclear ( also see werner 2012 , these proceedings ) .",
    "we also note the weak emission - line stars ( ` wels ' ; tylenda et al . 1993 ) which show narrow lines from the @xmath04650niii - ciii - civ blend and the civ@xmath05806 doublet ; ciii@xmath05696 is absent or weak , while heii @xmath04686 emission is often seen .",
    "these lines are also seen in some massive o - type stars , low - mass x - ray binaries and cataclysmic variables , so there is potential for misclassification .",
    "the ` wels ' appear to be a mixed group ( gesicki et al .",
    "2006 ) , including at least two different sub - classes : ( i ) h - rich stars with weak lines ( some would be classed as of or o(f ) at sufficient resolution ) , and ( ii ) h - poor stars with weaker winds than the [ wr]s . since several cspne have been classified as both of and ` wels ' in the literature , a correct classification may depend on the spectral coverage , resolution and sensitivity . even though the ` wels ' are heterogeneous , fogel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and girard et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that their pne have lower mean n / o ratios , indicating they derive from less - massive progenitors , as suggested by their average @xmath1 height ( see table  1 ) . additionally , several close - binary ( post - ce ) cspne show emission from the @xmath04650 blend and civ@xmath05806 . in these cases ,",
    "the emission lines arise from the heated hemisphere of a cool companion to the true ionizing star ( e.g. corradi et al .",
    "the main point to take from the previous discussion is the wide diversity of emission - line cspne . however ,",
    "even armed with modern multi - wavelength diagnostic tools to weed out the mimics that have contaminated pn catalogues in the past ( frew & parker 2010 ; frew et al .",
    "2010 ) , the observed diversity seen in pne and their ionizing stars indicates the ` pn phenomenon ' is heterogeneous . it is likely that several stellar evolutionary pathways form objects classified as pne ( frew & parker 2010 , 2011 ) , which include : + @xmath2 _ post - agb evolution of a single star _ , producing a classical pn .",
    "+ @xmath2 _ short - period interacting binaries _",
    "( @xmath3 @xmath4 0.2  20days ) that have passed through a ce phase ( de marco et al .",
    "post - ce pne appear to have quite distinct observational properties ( bond & livio 1990 ; frew & parker 2007 ; miszalski et al .",
    "moreover , some post - ce pne may contain double degenerate cores ( e.g. danehkar et al . 2012 ) , of interest because they are potential sn  ia progenitors ; there are even likely pne around the classical novae gk  per and v458  vul ( e.g. wesson et al . 2008 ) .",
    "+ @xmath2 _ longer - period interacting binaries _ , which may produce a range of phenomena , including circumstellar disks and collimated outflows .",
    "a possible example is ngc  6302 , whose rapidly expanding bipolar lobes were ejected 2000 years ago ( szyszka et al .",
    "soker & kashi ( 2012 ) speculate this is the product of a binary - induced _ intermediate luminosity optical transient _ , an idea that holds promise",
    ". a related object might be he  2 - 111 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . there are also highly collimated nebulae which host b[e ] nuclei ( e.g. mz  3 ) , with or without symbiotic characteristics .",
    "lastly , the yellow symbiotic stars ( frankowski & jorissen 2007 ) may be tentatively included here , plus the egb  6-like cspne , associated with dense , ionized circumstellar nebulae ( frew & parker 2010 ; miszalski et al .",
    "+ @xmath2 _ pathways that form h - deficient nuclei _ , such as the born - again scenario ( werner & herwig 2006 ) , where a very late helium flash sends a wd star back to the agb , forming a h - deficient cspn .",
    "it is possible that there are several alternative post - agb channels leading to h - poor cspne ( de marco 2002 ) , including binary - induced mixing ( de marco & soker 2002 ) and the diffusion - induced nova scenario ( miller bertolami et al .",
    "+ @xmath2 _ formation of pne with o(he ) nuclei_. these possibly descend from the r  crb stars , that may derive in turn from lower - mass wd mergers ( clayton et al .",
    "alternatively , they are related to the [ wn / wc ] stars , since two o(he ) stars have similar abundances to the cspn of pb  8 ( werner 2012 ) . moreover , any suggested relationships between the r  crb stars and the dusty [ wcl ] cspne are not yet clear ( clayton et al . 2011 ) .",
    "+ @xmath2 _ putative pne / wds from super - agb stars_. the sagb stars derive from the heavier ( 68@xmath5 ) intermediate - mass stars , which undergo core c burning to form o - ne wds ; h1504 + 65 might be an example ( althaus et al . 2009 ; werner 2012 ) , though it has no surrounding pn , while the ` hot dq ' stars ( dufour et al .",
    "2008 ) , and two cool o - rich wds found by gnsicke et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , are possible evolved o - ne cores and also of great interest .",

    "cols=\"<,<,^,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "volume - limited samples allow us to investigate the mean @xmath1 heights , and hence progenitor ages and masses of different cspn populations for the first time ; see frew & parker ( 2011 ) for approximate frequencies of the different types .",
    "table  [ table : z_heights ] summarises some preliminary results for a 3-kpc volume - limited disk sample ( @xmath9 = 425pne ) , which has a mean @xmath1 height of 240@xmath1040pc .",
    "we find some interesting trends , with the caveat that only @xmath1150% of nearby cspne have spectra , so there is sample bias ; e.g. the pg1159s are less luminous than the [ wc]s , so are less likely to be observed if close to the galactic plane .",
    "while several groups suffer from small number statistics , it is probable that the two born - again [ wc]-pg1159 stars in a30 and a78 come from lower - mass progenitors .",
    "similarly , the o(he ) stars may derive from the r  crb stars rather than the [ wc / wn ] path , looking at the scanty available data .",
    "we also caution that besides the ` wels ' , other classes are heterogeneous , such as the b[e ] stars , pg1159s and probably the [ wn / wc]s .",
    "obviously , larger samples are needed before more definite conclusions can be made .",
    "galactic pne currently number nearly 3000 ( frew & parker 2010 ; parker et al . , these proceedings ) , with more discoveries expected in the near future .",
    "the role of binarity in pn formation is becoming clearer , so continued surveys for new binaries ( e.g. douchin et al . , these proceedings )",
    "are needed to refine the post - ce frequency in the galactic disk .",
    "a detailed spectroscopic survey of all local cspne is also necessary , combined with multiwavelength observations of unusual nuclei in order to confront evolutionary theory . especially interesting",
    "are the ` wels ' , as new examples of [ wnc ] and [ wn ] stars may be lurking there .",
    "we look forward to the day when a precise taxonomy of pne and their ionizing stars is attained , but much more work is still to be done .",
