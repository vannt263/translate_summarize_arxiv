    "mond ( modified newtonian dynamics ) , is an empirical scheme invented by milgrom in 1983 @xcite , @xcite to account for what was then known about rotation curves of galaxies from the work of tully and fisher @xcite .",
    "famaey and mcgaugh have reviewed all aspects of the data with an exhaustive list of references @xcite .",
    "a valuable review of mond and its foundations has appeared in a recent article by sanders @xcite .    in mond",
    ", the observed total acceleration @xmath5 is related to newtonian acceleration @xmath6 by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a smooth fitting function , @xmath9 and @xmath0 is a universal constant with a value @xmath10 m s@xmath11 for all galaxies .",
    "there are three forms in common use .",
    "all three tend to @xmath12 for small @xmath6 .",
    "the most symmetrical is @xmath13 re - arranging this expression and equation ( 1 ) @xmath14 a star with rotational velocity @xmath15 in equilibrium with centrifugal force obeys @xmath16 @xmath17 is the gravitational constant and @xmath18 the galactic mass within radius @xmath19 ; the factor @xmath19 cancels and the tully - fisher relation emerges : @xmath20 famaey and mcgaugh show examples comparing this relation with rotation curves in their figs . 24 to 27 .",
    "mcgaugh demonstrated that galaxies with well determined rotational velocities follow the tully - fisher relation accurately over 5 decades of galactic mass @xcite .    in a later paper , mcgaugh concludes that gas - rich galaxies give the best determination of baryonic masses of galaxies , with the result @xmath21 m s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "gentile , famaey and de blok found @xmath22 m s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the radius of the universe is given by the hubble length @xmath23 . at the velocity of light , signals propagating round the periphery of the universe in any direction",
    "take time @xmath24 to complete one orbit .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 has the dimensions @xmath25 , with the result that @xmath24 has the dimensions of acceleration , as does @xmath0 .",
    "gravitational waves propagating round the periphery of a spherical universe in all directions then arrive in phase .",
    "1 shows the observed variation in galaxies between the total acceleration @xmath5 and newtonian acceleration @xmath26 .",
    "the conclusion was reached in an earlier paper @xcite that galaxies are fermi - dirac condensates in the graviton - nucleon interaction .",
    "consider gravitons arriving at the edge of a galaxy and distributed around an axis running from the periphery of the galaxy to its centre .",
    "these gravitons have very long wave - lengths and can interfere coherently with stars and clusters of stars over a very large volume .",
    "the overall result is given by the @xmath27 of this interaction acting as an amplifier .",
    "the result may be fitted by an airy disc with an adjustable radius parameter .",
    "the shape of fig . 1 defines the airy disc .",
    "as aside is that there was one unfortunate error of wording in ref .",
    "the text referred to the hubble acceleration ; this should read hubble constant .",
    "it has no effect on conclusions in that paper .",
    "-8 mm -4 mm    my proposal is that the same mechanism operates in the graviton - nucleon interaction on the scale of the universe .",
    "there are inhomogeneities in the universe , notably the sloan great wall .",
    "this will induce a similar shape to that in fig .",
    "we can only see such features as they were a long time ago .",
    "they will change with time as galaxies evolve and crash into one another .",
    "the fact that the universe is round suggests that effects of this evolution are damped oscillations ; it does not go pear - shaped .",
    "the inference is that the parameter @xmath0 originates from the curvature of space .",
    "milgrom forsaw this in the second of his early papers on mond @xcite .",
    "if @xmath4 changes , my prediction is that @xmath0 will change with it .",
    "there is an important result from a paper of milgrom on weak gravitational lensing of galaxies @xcite using data of brimioulle et al .",
    "they have examined foreground galaxies illuminated by a diffuse background of distant galaxies .",
    "they removed signals from the centres of foreground galaxies so that their edges and haloes could be studied .",
    "their objective was to study the dark matter halo .",
    "the asymptotic form @xmath28 of the acceleration varies as @xmath29 ; integrating this term leads to a logarithmic tail @xmath30 to the newtonian potential ; here @xmath31 is the mean radius for this term .",
    "milgrom transforms this into the variables used by brimioulle et al .",
    "he shows that their results obey mond predictions accurately over a range of accelerations @xmath32 m @xmath33 .",
    "averaged over this range , results are a factor @xmath34 larger than predicted by conventional dark matter haloes surrounding galaxies .",
    "1 shows the ratio of observed acceleration @xmath5 to newtonian acceleration as a function of @xmath35 . at the peak acceleration @xmath0 , the effect is larger than dark matter predicts by a factor @xmath36 .",
    "the conclusion is that the standard @xmath37 model needs serious modification .",
    "there are two sources of information on @xmath4 and its variation with time .",
    "one is the observed variation of type 1a supernovae as a function of red - shift @xmath38 .",
    "the second is the map of temperature fluctuations observed over the visible universe .",
    "this spectrum is expressed as a series of spherical harmonics up to angular momentum @xmath39 .",
    "peaks appear in the spectrum beginning at @xmath40 and falling as @xmath41 .",
    "a critical issue is how to interpret this spectrum .",
    "the recombination of hydrogen atoms after the big bang occurred over a volume with a diffuse edge .",
    "the slope of this edge governs the magnitudes of successive peaks between @xmath42 and 2500 .",
    "it arises from damping of the power spectrum at high @xmath43 values due to photon diffusion from high temperature regions to cooler regions , silk damping @xcite . in the correlations of temperature @xmath44 in the data published recently by the planck collaboration @xcite",
    ", there is a contribution from correlations @xmath45 in the baryon acoustic oscillations and also e- and",
    "b - mode polarisations . formulae are given in section 8.7 of a paper by straumann @xcite and have been used by the planck collaboration .",
    "a recent paper of schmittfull , challenor , hanson and lewis @xcite reviews in detail the fit to data .",
    "however , there is a serious point which has been overlooked .",
    "a corollary follows from milgrom s fit to the data of brimioulle et al . which agree with mond , but are far from the prediction of @xmath37 .",
    "here the photons come from distant galaxies .",
    "the baryonic acoustic oscillations are likewise carried by photons , which in this case originate from the cosmic microwave background .",
    "these must be treated in the same way .",
    "the conventional assumption made in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite is that photons from the cosmic microwave background are bent in weak gravitational lensing only by newtonian dynamics ( including small corrections for general relativity ) .",
    "however , since mond fits the data of brimioulle et al .",
    "but @xmath37 does not by a large margin , the astrophysics community should be alert to the fact that an additional energy @xmath46 originates from integrating the acceleration @xmath47 ; @xmath31 is the radius where the acceleration is @xmath0 .",
    "this is needed over the range of accelerations where mond explains the gravitational rotation curves , see figure 1 .",
    "it is not presently included in the fit to the baryonic acoustic oscillations but needs to be .    since @xmath37 disagrees with the data of brimioulle et al .",
    ", a new paradigam is required , as argued in a somewhat different context by kroupa , pawlovski and milgrom @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that there is a cosmic web of filaments , galaxies and voids on the scale of the universe .",
    "these appear in wmap data on very large scales , correponding to an angular dependence @xmath48 on the scale of the universe @xcite .",
    "two recent papers on the cosmic web are by alpaslan et al .",
    "@xcite and cantun et al .",
    "my proposal is that these structures again arise from the graviton - nucleon interaction on the scale of the universe .",
    "it is important to realise that the argument so far concerns the hubble constant at a particular time .",
    "it evolves with red - shift , as observed by the late - time acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",
    "this is conventionally described by the friedmann - lema^ itre - robertson - walker metric currently used to fit dark energy .",
    "this is a separate issue .",
    "another point concerns the precise shape of fig .",
    "was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite which gives values of the ratio @xmath49 at values of @xmath50 ; these are 171 at @xmath51 , 85 at @xmath52 , 30 at @xmath53 , 6 at @xmath54 and @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "the curve is symmetrical about @xmath51 .",
    "however , there are uncertainties in these values up to @xmath57 of the peak value , i.e. @xmath58 , in the tail of the distribution for @xmath59",
    ".    there has recently been great interest in results of the bicep collaboration @xcite .",
    "astrophysics groups should be aware that these results also require the same correction for the additional energy @xmath60 when fitting the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the primary conclusion is based on the fact that the parameter @xmath0 of mond agrees with @xmath2 .",
    "it may be understood as arising from the graviton - nucleon interaction .",
    "it was proposed earlier @xcite that galaxies are fermi - dirac condensates formed in this interaction .",
    "here it is proposed that the same graviton - nucleon interaction operates on the scale of the universe and leads to phase - locking of signals propagating round the periphery of the universe in any direction , hence the shape of the curve in fig . 1 .",
    "a second conclusion is that the cosmic microwave background needs to be fitted including a correction which derives from an additional energy @xmath61 which is presently missing from equations for the cosmic microwave background .",
    "one should remember that there has so far been no significant evidence for the detection of dark matter particles above the level of @xmath62 standard deviations , although there is no shortage of ideas what it might be .",
    "the consequence is that the cosmic microwave background is the primary source of the relative contributions to the universe of dark matter and dark energy today .",
    "the baryonic oscillations are presently fitted with 6 parameters , sometimes 9 .",
    "any error in allowing for variation of peak heights in these oscillations potentially has large repercussions on conclusions on galaxies and the universe as a whole .",
