    "specific information about the dynamics of cations in disordered ion conductors can be obtained via molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . for sa glasses",
    "it has been shown that regions of high ionic mobility form channels @xcite that arise statistically @xcite .",
    "proof for some structure at the scale of these channels can also be found in measurements of the dynamic structure factor @xcite .",
    "one of the most important md results for ma glasses is the observation that ions only rarely jump into sites vacated by the other species @xcite and that the site characteristics of both species are very different @xcite .",
    "several models @xcite , inspired by the observations of site selectivity , feature distinct sets of adapted sites for each alkali species .",
    "taking the site selectivity as a starting point one may ask whether the dynamics in the ma system of composition @xmath0 can be viewed as the _ independent _ superposition of two sa systems @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "if this were true the dramatic decrease of the dc conductivity in the ma system would be related to the well - known observation that the alkali dynamics in sa systems become much slower for lower alkali concentration and one might just speak of a dilution effect .",

    "borate glasses the mobility of sodium and rubidium is compared to that in pure na  borates and rb  borates with identical alkali content @xcite . despite a significant decrease of the conductivity for the ternary glasses the conductivity is still significantly larger than the sum of those in the respective sa glasses .",
    "furthermore , the experimental data reveal asymmetric behavior with respect to the two alkali species . a dramatic difference is visible when comparing the limit where the smaller ion ( here : na ) is the minority species as compared to the opposite limit .",
    "it turns out that the small ion as minority species is still relatively mobile and its diffusion constant , as determined by tracer diffusion experiments , only weakly depends on concentration .",
    "in contrast , in the other limit the large ion becomes immobile .",
    "similar observations have been already made in earlier experiments ; see e.g. @xcite .    a simple reason for the apparent increase of mobility in mixed alkali systems as compared to the sum of the individual glasses may be given by the different network structures . due to the higher",
    "alkali content in the mixed  alkali system the network structure is more discontinuous , giving rise to higher network mobility and thus , possibly , to higher alkali mobility .    beyond this effect it is discussed whether the adaption of the individual sites may change with time .",
    "the rearrangement of free volume has been put forward as a possible mechanism for the readaption , based on measurements of the pressure dependence of ionic conductivity @xcite : a site entered by a too large ion has to expand , while a site entered by a smaller ion can shrink .",
    "if both happens at the same time in close vicinity , an isochoric redistribution of site volume via relaxations of the matrix could facilitate the readaption of both sites .",
    "if this mechanism of _ matrix mediated coupling _ were indeed present , an important correlation between the unlike cations would be a present in the ma system @xcite .",
    "actually , the presence of the release of mismatches and thus the readaption of sites in the glassy phase has been already postulated in the dynamic structure model @xcite .",
    "others suppose that the adaption of a site is definitively fixed during the glass transition @xcite . in a very different approach",

    "furthermore , it turned out that on average a site was filled very soon after it was left by an ion .",
    "this is quantified by @xmath46 .",

    "there is no long - range ionic motion through the network before entering a new site .",
    "interestingly , in the sa system the potassium dynamics between two sites is nearly a factor of 10 slower than the lithium dynamics .",
    "this difference alone can not be explained only by the mass ratio of potassium and lithium . actually , it becomes smaller in the ma system .",
    "it may come as a surprise that the time @xmath46 during which a site is vacant is not much longer than the transition time @xmath45 between adjacent sites .",
    "this reflects strongly cooperative dynamics , as stressed in previous simulation work @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the distributions are significantly broader for the ma system .",

    "[ fig_times ] we show the corresponding cumulative distributions @xmath47 . comparing the data from the sa systems shown in the top part with those of the ma system ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively ) it turns out that the distribution is significantly broader in the latter case , in particular for long times .",

    "thus , the increasing relevance of dynamic heterogeneities in the ma case is our first observation , for which the dynamics displays qualitatively new features in ma systems as compared to sa systems .",
    "interestingly , the median values of the distributions of residence times increase by a factor of only ca .",
    "three in the ma system .",
    "thus the increase in residence times is not sufficient to explain the total extent of the mae ( factor 10 - 14 , see above ) .",
    "> from fig .",
    "[ fig_diff ] one can see that for the sa system the crossover to diffusive dynamics occurs on time scales somewhat longer than 100 @xmath53 . here",
    "we define crossover such that the extrapolation from the long - time diffusive behavior deviates by a factor of 2 from the actual mean square displacement .",
    "this time scale is close to the median of the waiting times .",
    "thus one may conclude that for the sa system the dynamics of ions from the slower half of the sites is not important for understanding the long - range transport .",
    "in contrast , for the ma case this crossover time can be estimated to be significantly beyond 10 @xmath17 .",
    "this implies that nearly the whole range of residence times is relevant for diffusive transport .",
    "so far we have analyzed the behavior of matched events , i.e. adapted sites hosting the appropriate ion . analyzing the waiting times for mismatched events we find , in particular for potassium , a strong reduction of the waiting times .",
    "this asymmetry in the behavior of lithium and potassium is also mirrored by the lower number of exclusive potassium sites mentioned in the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig_siteada ] .",
    "qualitatively , this may be related to the fact that it is difficult for a potassium ion to enter a smaller lithium site .",
    "a more quantitative version of this argument will be presented below .",

    "for each site , the value for potassium is plotted versus the value for lithium . adapted sites and mixed sites are distinguished by their relative occupation.,width=268 ]    although residences for mismatched events are on average significantly shorter than the residences found in matching events , the ranges covered by the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig_times ] are overlapping .",
    "the duration of mismatching events can thus reach time scales normally present in well adapted sites .",
    "this possibility is explored in fig .",
    "[ fig_maxtaukli ] .",
    "for each site that has been visited by both lithium and potassium ions , the maximum residence time of a potassium ion is plotted against the maximum residence time of a lithium ion in the same site .",

    "all the adapted sites show residence times in this range for ions of the favored kind .",
    "the maximum residence time of a mismatched ion can be very short .",
    "but surprisingly , the possible residence times of mismatching events too cover the whole range of values up to comparable maximum time scales for both species , despite the high specificity of the respective sites .",
    "even some strongly adapted sites seem thus to have the potential to accommodate ions of both species for a long time .     the mean distance from a site to the closest oxygen during potassium residences ,",
    "i.e. @xmath55 , is plotted versus the value found during lithium residences in the same site , i.e. @xmath56 . the bars give the typical ranges of values for sites visited by only one species .",
    ", width=268 ]    as a further step it is instructive to analyze the structural aspects of site specificity .",
    "the oxygen coordination environment of lithium and potassium sites is very different .",
    "one finds 4.5 oxygens up to @xmath57 for a lithium site and 10 at @xmath58 for a potassium site .",
    "the distances correspond to the first minima of the distribution function . a different way to characterize the differences is the observation that around a lithium ion , on average , three coordinating oxygen atoms are closer than 2.3 @xmath59 , while on average all coordinating oxygen atoms are further apart around a potassium ion .",
    "we determined for each site the mean distances @xmath60 between the center of the site and the i - th closest oxygen atom whenever this site was either occupied by a lithium or a potassium ion .",
    "in particular @xmath61 is an extremely sensitive quantity to the local structure of a site . in fig .",
    "[ fig_rox1kli ] @xmath55 is plotted vs. @xmath56 for all sites that have been visited by ions of both species .",

    "only adapted sites are taken into account .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     several interesting conclusions can be drawn about the distance to the next oxygen atom from fig .",
    "[ fig_rox1kli ] and the corresponding data of tab .",
    "[ median ] .",
    "first we discuss the properties of adapted sites .",
    "( 1 ) except for a single site one has @xmath62 .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the different radii of the two ion species .",
    "( 2 ) the median of @xmath56 and even the total distribution is very similar when comparing pure sites with adapted sites , which at least once have hosted a potassium site .",
    "thus the occasional occupation by potassium ions does not change the local structure of a lithium site .",
    "( 3 ) the reverse is not true .",
    "pure potassium sites have on average larger values of @xmath55 than adapted sites which at least once have hosted an lithium ion .",
    "thus lithium ions can only visit those potassium sites with not too large values of @xmath55 .",
    "( 4 ) lithium ions visiting a potassium site significantly attract the nearest oxygen .",
    "there is , however , only a partial adaption since the median of @xmath56 is still 0.20  larger than the median for lithium sites .",
    "( 5 ) in contrast , lithium sites only weakly adapt if entered by potassium ion .",
    "this is plausible from a chemical point of view because it is more difficult to compress the oxygen coordination shell rather than expanding it .",
    "what can we learn from the properties of the mixed sites ? a priori the mixed sites may have two different origins .",
    "first , they may reflect sites which during the first part of the 40ns were either lithium or potassium sites and in the second part changed their identity .",
    "this would give rise to a mixed average occupation .",
    "second , they are never potassium or lithium sites but just have a structure which allows both ions to enter this site . whereas the results in fig .",
    "[ fig_maxtaukli ] do not allow us to distinguish between both scenarios the data in fig .",
    "[ fig_rox1kli ] clearly demonstrates that the second scenario is valid .",
    "if during some time interval the mixed sites would have acted as potassium sites the values of @xmath55 should be in the range of the values for potassium sites .",
    "clearly , this is not the case .",
    "thus a relevant number of site transitions from lithium to potassium type or vice versa can not be seen .",

    "basically one counts the number of neighboring ions until the first minimum of the respective partial pair correlation functions . for li - li pairs",
    "we obtain 3.6 for k - k pairs 4.1 and for li - k pairs 3.0 .",
    "this clearly shows that , on the one hand , there is a slight tendency for clustering of like ions and , on the other hand , potassium ions have more neighbors than lithium ions .",
    "the latter point is a direct consequence of the fact that potassium has a larger ionic radius than lithium and thus has a larger nn sphere .",
    "it directly translates into the observation that also the number of nn sites is larger for potassium ( 8.1 ) than for lithium ( 7.1 ) .    of direct relevance for the dynamics",

    "it turns out that only ca .",
    "60% and 40% of all nn sites were used as destinations for jumps by lithium and potassium ions , respectively . for the slowest sites ,",
    "not all suitable neighbors may have been explored during the analyzed interval , especially in the case of potassium . but even considering this possibility , a significant fraction of nn sites must remain where the saddles are too large for a hop to occur . in the next step",
    "one may analyze the nature of those neighbors actually accessed during the simulation .",
    "it turns out that 70% of them are matching for the jumping ion .",

    "for example habasaki demonstrated an additional slowdown of the lithium dynamics , if the potassium ions in a ma system were completely fixed @xcite .",
    "the inferred correlations between jumps of different ions should be directly observable as an altered probability for a second jump shortly before or after one jump has happened .",
    "for each site , we have determined the number of jumps originating from one of its nn sites in dependence on the time difference @xmath76 to a jump from the central site .",
    "jumps by the same ion were ignored .",
    "the resulting distribution of jump probabilities was normalized and averaged over all sites .",
    "the value of one corresponds to the number of jumps from the neighbors happening without the influence of a jump from the central site , i.e. the behavior for long @xmath78 . to gain an estimate of the scale of fluctuations in the results ,",
    "this analysis was done separately for four subsequent pieces of the simulation of @xmath79 duration each .",
    "the distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_correl ] are the average over these four partial distributions .",
    "the error bars correspond to the standard deviation of the peak heights .",
    "the peaks show an increase in the number of nearby jumps by a factor of @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the lithium and potassium sa systems , respectively . for the correlations among like ions in the ma system , a factor of @xmath82",
    "is found for both lithium and potassium .",
    "correlations among jumps by unlike ions are weaker , but also present .",
    "the values are @xmath83 for the lithium neighbors of a potassium ion , and also for potassium ions surrounding a lithium . in all cases , the maximum probability for correlated jumps",
    "is found at the time of the first jump , @xmath84 , and the peak is symmetrical .",
    "careful inspection reveals that the peak consists of a narrow peak with half width close to 1 ps and a broad peak with with half width close to 5 ps .",
    "the latter peak will be discussed below .",
    "the most simple scenario compatible with these findings is that a second ion jumps from a neighbor site into the site just vacated by the jump of the first ion .",
    "indeed these correlations are reflected by the sharp peaks . but more complex correlations are also conceivable , which can generally be separated from the former kind by the additional condition that the two jumps use four distinct sites as start and end points ; see fig .",
    "[ scheme ] for a sketch .",
    "the remaining correlations are responsible for the broad peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig_correl ] . for a quantitative analysis",
    "the maximum height is not suitable .",
    "rather we show the integrals @xmath85 over the peaks ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_intcorr ] . on the one hand",
    ", we integrate over the total peaks and , on the other hand , only over the remaining correlations if we use the additional four - site condition introduced above .",
    "the total extent of four  site correlations given by the thicker lines is significant in all cases , amounting to ca .",
    "50% of the total .",
    "to characterize the observed correlations , we determined the relative directions of the central jump and the correlated ones , given by the cosine of the enclosed angle .",
    "the directions of jumps using a common site are strongly correlated in all cases , as it is geometrically required .",
    "the jumps involved in four  site correlations are instead preferentially antiparallel in the sa systems . in the ma system ,",
    "no correlation is discernible for the four  site correlations .",
    "interestingly , the curve labelled li(k ) , i.e. the probability of a lithium jump to follow a potassium jump , displays an asymmetry since it mainly increases for @xmath86 .",
    "accordingly , the curve k(li)shows the opposite asymmetry .",
    "both observations imply that it is more likely that a jump of a potassium ion may trigger a jump of a lithium ion than vice versa .",
    "this observation is consistent our previous results that potassium sites are better suited for lithium ions than vice versa . a more detailed analysis",
    ", however , is necessary to further clarify the origin of this asymmetry .    in this analysis of correlations ,",
    "all sites are taken into account with equal weight . when the sites are weighted according to the number of jumps taking place , the general effects remain , but their strength is greatly reduced .",
    "one can thus conclude that dynamic correlation effects are particularly important in the vicinity of slow sites .",
    "the results favor an explanation of the mixed  alkali effect based on ionic sites that are specific for the different alkali species .",
    "the strongly bimodal distribution of occupation probabilities @xmath39 shows that @xmath70 of the ions reside in sites with a strong preference for one kind of ion .",
    "we have shown before that the location of the ionic sites is stable on the time scale of ionic transport @xcite .",
    "it appears thus justified to treat the preference of a site for one species of ions as fixed over the course of the simulations .",
    "possible effects of rare readaptions would still be incorporated via the treatment of `` mixed '' sites .    trying to quantify the mixed ",
    "alkali effect in terms of properties of single sites or ions , the most direct contribution is observed in the distribution of residence times .",
    "the typical duration of residences in the predominant specific sites in the ma system is increased compared to the sa glasses . but",
    "this effect can account for only a small part of the observed mixed  alkali effect .",
    "the increased probability for correlated forward ",
    "backward jumps will also add to the slowdown .",
    "as already in the sa systems the effect is strongest for sites with low residence times . among them",
    "will be mismatching jump events , which generally have shorter @xmath28 than matching ones .",
    "but only for potassium ions this tendency translates into a further increase of @xmath67 .",
    "the backjump probability of lithium is hardly affected by the adaption of the @xmath66 site .",
    "the maximum residence times and the oxygen coordination distances show that even strongly adapted sites can temporarily accommodate mismatching ions .",
    "lithium again is favored , because it is apparently easier for the coordinating oxygens to approach than it is to recede from a site .",
    "but generally , both types of ions also visit mismatching sites , suggesting also some degree of interaction between the different species .",
    "the data on two  ion correlations shows in fact that the dynamics of the different species in the mixed glass are not independent .",
    "the strongest correlations were observed for ions taking up sites just vacated by like ions , but foreign sites are also reached .",
    "potassium ions will jump back with increased probability , but lithium ions are as likely to move on into a third place as from a matching site . for them , the correlations with the different ions should thus in fact facilitate transport .    as mentioned above the main difference between lithium and potassium",
    "is the ability of lithium to enter a potassium site without an immediate backjump , helped by the local oxygen environment .",
    "the reverse is strongly suppressed .",
    "this asymmetry is consistent with the larger mismatch evident in the residence times for potassium . for the present case of identical lithium and potassium concentration",
    "the transport is mainly via the matched sites for both species . in the limit",
    "where one species is very dilute the relevance of transport via mixed or mismatched sites may become important and may be relevant in particular for the smaller ion",
    ".    it may be interesting to compare the `` first - principle '' observations of this simulation work with the assumptions , used in the most recent version of the dynamic structure model @xcite for the ma effect in solid glasses .",
    "most ingredients like the presence of two different types of sites or the asymmetry between the smaller and the larger cation fully agree with our observations .",
    "there are , however , two aspects which are somewhat more speculative and where the present simulations yield new insight .",
    "do sites change their character on time scales much shorter than the @xmath87 relaxation time ?",
    "do so - called c@xmath88 sites exist ? they are viewed as sites which after being vacated in the melt are somewhat smaller than the sites , actually visited by ions . from the simulations we have seen that on time scales up to the diffusive regime sites",
    "keep their identity so that the notion of a dynamic energy landscape is not supported by the simulation data .",
    "furthermore there is no signature of possible c@xmath88 sites",
    ". they would be relevant if on the diffusion time scale transformations from c@xmath88 sites to regular sites and vice versa would occur .",
    "this would show up in a large number of sites , visited by the ions during the simulation run .",
    "since the total number of sites , however , is just 8% larger than the number of ions there is basically no place for a large number of c@xmath88 sites being transformed to regular sites and vice versa .    in summary , a ma slowdown can be observed in the residence times as well as from increased likelihood of backjumps .",
    "independent jump paths are favored .",
    "but the interception is not complete , as even mismatching sites are also accessible .",
    "although actual cooperativity seems limited to the slowest ions , an enhancement of cation mobility is likely to follow .",
    "together with the fast network dynamics in ma systems this rationalizes the enhanced dynamics in ma systems as compared to the predicted dynamics by assuming a dilution effect .",
    "furthermore a significant asymmetry in the behavior of the smaller and the larger cation is observed .",
    "it will be interesting to see , whether an even closer analysis of the ma system , e.g. in terms of site and saddle energies , will be compatible with very recent explicit models of the dynamics in ma systems @xcite . furthermore a closer relation to ion - exchange experiments",
    "might be illuminating .",
