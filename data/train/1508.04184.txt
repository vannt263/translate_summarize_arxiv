    "twenty years after the discovery @xcite of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) dyakonov @xcite wrote a rather sharp critique of the present state of its theory . among his criticisms",
    "were the absence of any simple or beautiful first - landau - level ( fll ) formulation of the hierarchy wave functions ( @xmath7 ) , the lack of an explicit representation of conjugate states ( e.g. , fillings where @xmath8 , so @xmath0 = 2/3 , 3/5 , etc . ) , the absence of a justification for wave functions in terms of underlying principle such as minimizing the interaction energy , and the lack of a sound theoretical foundation for concepts such as composite fermions ( cfs ) , which he argued had been neither derived nor even adequately defined .",
    "while recognizing the phenomenological success of jain s  wave function engineering \" from which the notion of cfs @xcite derives , he argued that far too many simple questions about the fqhe remain without reasonable answers .",
    "here we address some of dyakonov s concerns by providing an explicit mapping from the strongly - correlated - electron form of fqhe wave functions to a quasi - electron ( or cf ) form , yielding wave functions algebraically identical to those of the noninteracting integer qhe .",
    "this is done for both the sphere and plane .",
    "the quasi - electrons have a simple analytic form and are eigenstates of the angular momentum operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and also carry a label @xmath5 related to haldane s @xmath11-wave pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "the quasi - electrons occupy fine - structure fll sub - shells distinguished by the same label .",
    "the wave functions for @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspond to configurations where @xmath11 sub - shells are fully filled by their respective quasi - electrons .",
    "the sub - shell structure is induced by the coulomb interaction , with the gap between neighboring sub - shells reflecting the energy cost of removing one @xmath11-wave coupling between quasi - electron 1 and one of its @xmath14 neighbors .",
    "we discuss the relevance of the construction to a number of current questions about the fqhe , including the relationship between cf and hierarchical descriptions of wave functions @xcite ; the structure of the @xmath6 state @xcite , where we argue there exist alternative majorana and pseudo - dirac descriptions associated with the symmetries at this filling , and where we identify an operator quite similar to a pfaffian ; and possible systematic improvements of wave functions , in the spirit of an effective theory , that may help address certain open questions about the fqhe .",
    "jain constructed his 2/5 , 3/7 , 4/9 , ... hierarchy wave functions by first operating with a multiply - filled integer quantum hall state on the half - filled symmetric state , producing a wave function spread over multiple higher landau levels , which then was projected numerically onto the fll , eliminating the unwanted components . when tested against numerical solutions obtained by diagonalizing the coulomb interaction , excellent overlaps",
    "were found , comparable to those for laughlin s @xcite @xmath0= 1/3 and 1/5 wave functions .",
    "however , as dyakonov discusses , the jain construction is troubling on several grounds .",
    "laughlin s @xmath0= 1/3 and 1/5 states are supported by certain variational arguments .",
    "for example , at short - distances the wave functions vary as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , eliminating the most repulsive multipoles of the electron - electron coulomb interaction @xmath17 .",
    "jain s construction makes no reference to the electron - electron interaction , but instead employs an operator taken from the noninteracting integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) , with electrons occupying higher lls characterized by large magnetic gaps , which at the end are eliminated numerically  a procedure dyakonov termed  bizarre . \"",
    "laughlin s wave function can be expressed analytically as simple products of closed - shell operators , while jain s final result has no such representation .",
    "laughlin s construction is based on the rescaling of all inter - electron correlations , for @xmath18 , by factors of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , a procedure that reflects the scale invariance of the underlying coulomb potential . in 1996",
    "ginocchio and haxton @xcite ( gh ) generalized this approach to successively larger groups of electrons : recognizing that higher density  defects \" would necessarily arise beyond @xmath21  beyond this filling @xmath11-wave electron pairs must start to appear  they introduced operators to create such defects , then looked for solutions that would distribute these over - dense regions uniformly . on the sphere the closed - shell operators laughlin employed",
    "can be labeled by the quantum number @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the electron number .",
    "the gh construction produces a larger class of such scalar operators , defined by two quantum numbers @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "the gh and laughlin operators coincide for @xmath24=0 .",
    "the gh operators generate the full set of hierarchy states ( the jain states ) when @xmath25 is allowed to run , constrained by @xmath26 ; and they generate hierarchy states and their conjugates when @xmath27 are varied , without constraints .",
    "these quantum numbers are related to the electron number by @xmath28 .",
    "the gh operators were later used by jain and kamilla @xcite , but otherwise have not been broadly applied .",
    "one reason may be the limitation to the sphere : gh used this geometry because spherical @xmath29-electron wave functions generated from scalar operators have total angular momentum @xmath30 , guaranteeing both translational invariance and homogeneity ( uniform one - body density ) . but most investigators work in the plane , where simple polynomials replace angular momentum couplings .",
    "second , while the gh treatment of higher - order electron correlations led to operators with a manifest sub - shell structure , implying a fine - structure splitting of the fll , this structure was not obvious in the final wave functions : the gh operators contain spherical tensor derivatives ( operators that destroy magnetic flux ) that can be evaluated analytically , but a compact form of the scalar wave function with all such derivates eliminated by such evaluation was not provided .",
    "this shortcoming complicates the construction of analogous wave functions in the plane , as derivatives on the sphere are associated with raising and lowering operators that operate only within finite hilbert spaces , unlike the case of the plane .",
    "although the gh construction addresses two issues dyakonov raised  producing an analytic generalization of laughlin s construction with the same variation justification , and generating the full sets of hierarchy and conjugate states ",
    "the final wave functions lack the elegant simplicity of laughlin s results .",
    "gh , in fact , did not seek the most simple application of their operators , as their goal was to account for jain s surprising construction .",
    "thus they applied their @xmath31 operators as jain did his iqhe operators , acting directly on the half - filled shell .",
    "this procedure yields results numerically identical to jain s , and demonstrates that correlations within the fll generate an su(2 ) sub - shell algebra distinct from but algebraic identical to that of multiply filled iqhe states .",
    "this algebraic similarity accounts for jain s success , though his construction misses the connection between broken scalar pairs and the generation of angular momentum that is responsible for the gh fll sub - shell structure .    in this paper",
    "we discuss an alternative use of gh operators , as creators of quasi - electrons .",
    "the resulting gh@xmath32 hierarchy and conjugate states are closed - shell configurations of families of quasi - electrons , all of which have a common form as tensor products of two spinors , one creating an electron and one creating a single unit of magnetic flux . as the construction eliminates all gh derivatives , wave functions can be readily expressed in either spherical or planar geometry .",
    "the gh@xmath32 quasi - electron wave function of filling @xmath33 and magnetic field strength @xmath34 is identical in form to the iqhe electron wave function of the same electron number , but in a reduced magnetic field @xmath35 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review properties of laughlin s wave functions , providing benchmarks for subsequent discussions of other hierarchy states .",
    "we use the laughlin wave function to illustrate how planar operators can be written as analogs of spherical ones , and use this mapping to define states of uniform density in the plane  otherwise an ill - defined concept , in our view .",
    "this involves reorganizing the usual planar degrees of freedom into single - particle and schur - polynomial spinors , with the latter representing the addition of a unit of magnetic flux .",
    "we describe how vector products can be formed in the plane to produce quasi - electrons with good angular momentum , and consequently how to generate planar  scalars \" that are both translationally invariant and uniform in density .    in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the gh operator construction in more detail than was possible in the original letter @xcite .",
    "we describe the @xmath31 form , connected with electron correlations , and the @xmath36 form , connected with fll shell fine structure .",
    "the two representations allow one to understand the connections between fll electron correlations , energy minimization , and sub - shell structure .    in section iv",
    "we show how the gh operators can be used to produce hierarchy and conjugate states in their gh@xmath32 form , noninteracting quasi - electrons occupying filled sub - shells .",
    "we describe properties of the quasi - electrons , then properties of the low - momentum representation of the many - electron states that can be built as closed - shell configurations of the quasi - electrons .",
    "we illustrate the novel properties of the sub - shell structure , which is not static but evolves as electrons are added , considering various  trajectories \" in the two - parameter hilbert space , such as fixed @xmath0 with increasing @xmath29 , or fixed magnetic field strength with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "we describe symmetries associated with in the exchange of the particle and flux spinors for the @xmath6 case , where the quasi - electrons exhibit special symmetries : we find majorana - like and dirac - like solutions at @xmath6 , the latter associated with spin flip .",
    "we also show the connection to the pfaffian .",
    "we evaluate the overlaps of gh@xmath32 wave functions with results from exact diagonalizations of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the concluding section v includes a discussion of issues for further study .",
    "the formalism is suggestive of an effective theory , and we remark on work that could be undertaken to explore this possibility , including potential connections to states at fillings like @xmath37 .    in the appendix",
    ", we present a more technical discussion of correlations , to contrast the current construction ( which is guided by the scale invariance of the coulomb potential ) with alternative variational schemes focused of the short wave behavior of wave functions , e.g. , some generalization of the haldane pseudopotential for interactions among multiple electrons .",
    "* single electron states in the plane : * the hamiltonian for an electron moving in a plane under the influence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath38 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the electron mass and @xmath41 is the electron charge .",
    "we take the direction of electron rotation to be clockwise in the @xmath42 plane ( as viewed in a right - handed coordinate system from positive @xmath43 ) , a choice that requires b to be negative  the field points in the @xmath44 direction .",
    "thus @xmath45 is positive . in the symmetric gauge",
    "we employ @xmath46 .",
    "* single electron states on the sphere : * the original gh operator construction was done on the sphere , a fqhe geometry introduced by haldane @xcite : the electrons move on the sphere s surface under the influence of a radial magnetic field generated by a dirac monopole at the origin .",
    "this geometry provides two advantages .",
    "first , in contrast to the plane , there is both a defined surface area and a fixed number of fll single - particle states , determined by the number of monopole quanta .",
    "thus densities and fractional fillings can be defined unambiguously .",
    "second , on the sphere many - electron states with total @xmath9=0 are both homogeneous  uniform density over the sphere  and translationally invariant ( displacements generated by @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) @xcite . states with @xmath30 can be constructed from single - particle spinors of good @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( rotation matrices ) , using standard angular momentum coupling methods .",
    "dirac s monopole quantization condition requires the total magnetic flux through the sphere of radius @xmath61 to be an integral multipole of the elementary flux @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the hamiltonian for an electron confined to the sphere is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the dynamical angular momentum , @xmath66 is the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",

    "iii , jain used the antisymmetric iqhe state consisting of the lowest @xmath85 shells , fully occupied , as an operator , acting on the half - filled shell .",

    "the many - electron hilbert space consists of slater determinants form from these single - particle wave functions defined above .",
    "the degeneracy among these states is the broken by the interaction . in the case of the sphere , as the fll single - particle basis is of dimension @xmath79 , the fraction of the single particles states filled is @xmath99 .",

    "such states will then be automatically translationally invariant and can also be considered homogeneous , as we discuss below .",

    "( that is , the slater determinants one forms will have polynomials that depend only on coordinate differences , while the center - of - mass of the @xmath29-electron system will be in the lowest harmonic oscillator state .",

    "is this important ?",
    "in our view , some discussions about approximate fqhe wave functions in the literature are misguided , treating the approximate wave function as a representation of the true wave function .",
    "we do not think this is a sensible viewpoint .",
    "first , it is clear that the pursuit of improved wave functions is futile , as all constructions deal with some low - momentum portion of the hilbert space , and thus the resulting wave function always can be improved by mixing in any component not in that hilbert space : this is the variational principle .",
    "consequently the overlap of any approximate wave function with the true wave function will deteriorate with increasing @xmath29 : because the approximate wave function resides in a limited low - momentum hilbert space , in any defined area of the plane , it will omit some high - momentum components .",
    "if one now doubles the area , and then doubles again , the chances that a high - momentum component will be found somewhere in the extended regions grows combinatorially .",
    "consequently the overlap is eventually driven to zero .",
    "this trend can be seen in numerical results generically .",
    "a more sensible definition of the approximate wave function is as a projection of the true wave function to some low - momentum space  an effective wave function .",
    "because the wave functions discussed here are filled slater determinants , the prescription for their construction defines a projection operator @xmath443 onto a low - momentum hilbert space that contains only a single state . normally in an effective theory ( et ) , a lo projected wave function is considered a good starting point if it has a strong overlap with @xmath444 , the exact solution projected onto the chosen low - momentum hilbert space . by this standard the gh@xmath32 wave function is a trivially exact lo wave function , as the projection @xmath443 only contains one state . an interesting question  as the coulomb interaction provides no scale for use as an expansion parameter  is the construction of corrections , to produce an improved nlo wave function .",
    "because the gh@xmath32 wave function is based on a simple set of quasi - electron degrees of freedom , one has a starting point that could conceivably could allow nlo corrections .",
    "a first step in such a process is suggested by , for example , cases similar to panels a ) and c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fixedmag ] ,  open - shell \" quasi - electron states .",
    "unlike the case of the gh or jain wave functions , the gh@xmath32 construction provides a simple but nontrivial @xmath443 for such cases , consisting of a set of degenerate quasi - electron configurations .",
    "we return to this topic below .",
    "in this paper we have constructed an explicit quasi - electron representation of the hierarchy and conjugate fqhe states .",
    "the quasi - electrons have a generic form , a vector product of an spinor that creates single - electron states and one formed from schur polynomials that adds a unit of magnetic flux to all existing electrons .",
    "the quasi - electrons and the sub - shell structure they induced within the fll are quite novel , with both the sub - shell structure and quasi - electrons evolving as particles or magnetic flux are added .",
    "effectively the construction explicitly maps the problem of electrons strongly interacting in a partially filled sub - shell , into a noninteracting problem , a single slater determinant of quasi - electrons .",
    "the quasi - electrons are fermions that carry good @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the scalar many - body states they form as slater determinants are translationally invariant and homogeneous ( uniform one - body density ) .",
    "the construction is done both on the plane and on the sphere .",
    "the hierarchy and conjugate states corresponds to those fillings @xmath0 where the quasi - electron representations of the wave functions are unique , consistent of a set of completely filled shells .",
    "the resulting wave function defines a low - momentum hilbert space consisting of one slater determinant that efficiently captures much of the long wave - length behavior of the fqhe .",
    "the quasi - electron su(2 ) fine structure that exists in the fll is governed by energy gaps that represent the cost of replacing a favorable scalar pair @xmath445 ^ 0 $ ] by an unfavored pair @xmath445 ^ 1 $ ] . as implemented in the gh@xmath32 wave function",
    ", this replacement affects correlations at all distance scales , and thus is a variational ansatz consistent with the scale - invariance of the coulomb potential .",
    "( laughlin s construction has the same property , though it is often misconstrued as a strategy for limiting unfavorable short - range correlations . )",
    "the connection between correlations and angular momentum is natural in the fqhe , as the generator of rotations is the sum over pair - breaking single - electron operators .",
    "these observations address the issues that troubled dyakonov and others about the use of multiply - occupied lls in the jain construction : jain borrowed the needed su(2 ) algebra from the iqhe , while in fact the physically relevant su(2 ) algebra comes from correlations within the fll .",
    "the construction was extended to the plane in two steps .",
    "we first defined a truncated hilbert space in the plane that contains the same number of single - electron degrees of freedom as on the sphere .",
    "effectively this defines a planar analog of the angular momentum operator @xmath9 .",
    "we then packaged these degrees of freedom in single - particle ( electron ) and schur - polynomial ( magnetic flux ) spinors , so that we could exploit the natural mapping between @xmath446 and the @xmath447 , and thus between rotational invariance on the sphere and translational invariance in the plane .",
    "we introduced scalar and tensor products on the plane that preserved the homomorphism between the respective lowering operators .",
    "consequently , we were able to construct in a simple procedure @xmath29-electron scalar wave functions in the plane that are translationally invariant and that have a uniform one - body density ( homogeneous ) , where the latter property is defined by the homomorphism with the sphere .",
    "while the cf picture of the quantum hall effect has been an important theme of the field for many years , we are not aware of any detailed , explicit construction of the quasi - electrons and their sub - shell structure within the fll , on the plane and on the sphere , and including the full set of both hierarchy and conjugate states .",
    "the quasi - electrons that emerge are qualitatively in good accord with the ideas of jain , exhibiting for example the screening of the magnetic flux through the absorption of magnetic flux quanta in the intrinsic ( scalar ) wave functions of the quasi - electrons : screening is manifested in anti - aligned couplings of electrons to magnetic flux .",
    "however , there are differences in detail , including the form of the quasi - electrons ( the coupling of an electron spinor to a single magnetic flux spinor , not two ) and the existence of an explicit fll fine structure , reflecting the fact that there are multiple types of quasi - electrons , sharing a common functional form but differing in their electron / magnetic flux angular momentum couplings .",
    "there are also hierarchical aspects of the construction , though the notion of hierarchical structures seems most relevant to the regions of over - density or under - density , or equivalently , to the set of @xmath11 distinct quasi - electrons that must be added , one to each occupied quasi - electron shell , to create new wave functions of the same @xmath0 but with @xmath11 additional electrons and @xmath448 new flux quanta .",
    "there is a clear hierarchical structure among the @xmath11 added quasi - electrons .",
    "consistent with the observation that @xmath6 is the convergence point for the series @xmath267 and @xmath449 , a dense collection of gh@xmath32 states can be defined as the large-@xmath29 limit of the series @xmath320=constant .",
    "each corresponds to a deep fermi sea of quasi - electrons , containing @xmath450 occupied shells .",
    "we discussed particular symmetries of these states , including the @xmath329 trajectory that is symmetric under interchange of electron and magnetic flux spinors , and associated with an additive charge , and the trajectory @xmath414 , which is the particle - hole symmetric case .",
    "finally , motivated by the pfaffian , we described the gh@xmath32 wave functions in perhaps their simplest form , as a operator involving only the coordinates @xmath288 acting on the bosonic half - filled shell .",
    "the quasi - electrons are then generated by simple operators @xmath451 than act on the scalars @xmath430 , which can be regarded as the corresponding bosonic quasi - electron . in this language , the @xmath6 @xmath329 state becomes a product of particle - hole excitations of the bosonic vacuum , where the holes correspond to destroyed scalars @xmath292 ^ 0 $ ] , and the particles the @xmath292 ^ 1 $ ] .",
    "this form of the gh@xmath32 construction provides a series of operators that can be used as pfaffians are typically used .",
    "we argue that they are better motivated physically , as they do not focus exclusively on the short - range properties of the coulomb potential .",
    "one of the advantages of a simple representation of wave functions is that it provides an intuitive starting point for understanding the physical mechanisms behind less well understood aspects of the fqhe .",
    "we mention two possibilities for extending the gh@xmath32 construction , to make further progress .",
    "a set of states of fractional filling 3/8 , 4/11 , 6/17 , ... , residing between @xmath0=1/3 and 1/5 , have been discovered experimentally @xcite .",
    "these states nominally correspond to  open sub - shell \" quasi - particle configurations where the sub - shell that is filled at @xmath211 is instead partially filled , and thus where a set of degenerate many - body quasi - electron states exist ( see fig [ fig : fixedmag ] ) .",
    "that is , the hilbert space @xmath443 defined by the quasi - electron construction is no longer trivial , but contains multiple states .",
    "the situation is precisely analogous to the original problem that the gh@xmath32 construction addresses , finding the best simple low - momentum representation of interacting electrons that occupy an open shell : quasi - electrons now replace the electrons .    in the context of a nonrelativistic et",
    ", this problem likely presents the first step toward generalization . any truncation in a hilbert space , such as that implicit in the quasi - electron construction ,",
    "must be accompanied by the introduction of an effective interaction , to account for the degrees of freedom that have been integrated out . that effective interaction can be derived from the full hamiltonian",
    "; alternatively , it can be parameterized , by fitting the associated low - energy constants to data .",
    "we have not needed to address this problem in our construction , because the hierarchy and conjugate states are the unique cases where the projection @xmath443 is onto a single state .",
    "in such cases the effective interaction clearly has no role in altering the wave function : it only contributes to ground state energy shift , which we have not addressed in this paper .",
    "however , the case of an open quasi - electron sub - shell is different , as the lo hilbert space defined by @xmath443 is no longer trivial , and thus @xmath452 is important , as it breaks the degeneracy within @xmath443 and thus determines the nature of the ground state .",
    "progress we have made on this problem , including the analytic wave function that is obtained , will be described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a second open question concerns the nature of the half - filled shell , specifically the observation that at @xmath432 there is a strong fqhe state that may be fully spin polarized , while there is no evidence for such a state at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "descriptions of the @xmath432 state in terms of pfaffians or anti - pfaffians have claimed some success .",
    "but in the context of the present construction , the differences between the @xmath6 and @xmath432 states presents a puzzle , as non - degenerate lo candidate states could be constructed for either .",
    "the lo wave function would fully populate the lowest two lls in the case of @xmath432 , generating a contribution to the effective interaction for the valence electrons , but such a shift in single electron energies should not affected the correlations .",
    "this leads to the speculation that the differences between these two states must arise from corrections to the present construction , that is , from next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) contributions .",
    "many ets have an obvious expansion , a small parameter such as the ratio of yukawa masses in a potential with both short- and long - range components . but",
    "the coulomb interaction contains no such scales . instead",
    ", the natural et expansion for the coulomb interaction is that used in classical electromagnetism , the multipole expansion .",
    "the expansion parameter is not intrinsic to the potential , but rather to the geometry : @xmath453 where @xmath89 is the multipole order , @xmath61 is the size of the regions of charge , and @xmath454 their separation .",
    "because the fqhe is modeled as a one - component system in a neutralizing but static background , one anticipates that the nlo corrections would be associated with @xmath455 .",
    "while in the fll electrons are restricted to the lowest circular cyclotron orbit , this is not the case for the @xmath432 state , where the intrinsic cyclotron motion carries two quanta .",
    "the orbit can respond to higher multipoles .",
    "this problem has analogs elsewhere in physics , where the symmetry - violating effects connected with quadrupole interactions drive objects to deform , with symmetry then restored by the associated goldstone mode , the correlated low - frequency collective motion of the deformed objects .",
    "this physics is frequently most dramatic at half - filled shells , for the reasons apparent in the fqhe : the regions of over - density or under - density involve the correlations among the maximum number of quasi - electrons @xmath450 .",
    "that is , @xmath453 is at its most favorable point .",
    "the single - particle cyclotron orbits for valence electrons in the @xmath432 state can respond to the interactions beyond the monopole , and presumably do so in the process of minimizing their energy variationally .",
    "we are intrigued by the fact that the candidate et is the multipole expansion , that higher lls could respond to terms beyond the monopole , and that the consequence of such corrections are often startling , as they lead to symmetry breaking and restoration through long - wavelength collective modes .",
    "these possibilities should be explored .",

    "it is then natural to turn to the three - electron correlation to limit unfavorable interactions : a three - electron constraint can guarantee that electrons correlated in a p - wave ( iqhe two - electron droplets ) remain separated from any similar overdensity , minimizing the energy , at least until some critical density is reached .",
