    "<S> both the short term instability on few second time scale and the long term stability over one day are essential . </S>",
    "<S> so far , mostly frequency standards and oscillators operating in the microwave domain , such as hydrogen masers and cryogenic microwave oscillators for improved short term stability @xcite , are used .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , oscillators operating in the optical domain have demonstrated fractional frequency instabilities with allan deviation of @xmath6 at @xmath7  s @xcite . for most of the applications mentioned above it would be desirable if the short term stability of the oscillator could be kept also at much longer times without the need of a sophisticated optical atomic clock . </S>",
    "<S> however , aging in the commonly employed ultra - low expansion ( ule ) glass cavities leads to a poorly predictable non - linear shrinkage of the resonator length @xmath8 on the order of @xmath9 to @xmath10 @xcite , which translates to frequency drifts @xmath11 of the cavity resonance . due to residual temperature fluctuations of the cavity , </S>",

    "<S> recently , we have set up a laser system based on a single - crystal cryogenic silicon cavity . </S>",
    "<S> silicon possesses a zero - crossing in the coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) at a relatively high temperature of @xmath23 , which greatly reduces the technical demands of cooling . </S>",

    "<S> the crystalline nature also lets us expect high long - term stability @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we present our measurements with this system obtained over an extended period of time , where the frequency of the laser system has been compared to the @xmath22sr optical lattice clock at ptb @xcite and to a hydrogen maser which is referenced to a primary cs fountain clock @xcite .    to minimize the effect of any remaining drift of the cavity temperature @xmath27 on its length , </S>",
    "<S> operating the cavity as close as possible to the zero cte temperature @xmath28 is crucial . for small deviations @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> the length and frequency of the silicon cavity depend on its temperature @xmath30 according to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the minimum length of the cavity at @xmath33  k , and @xmath34 is the slope of the cte around @xmath28 @xcite . a low - vibration cryostat employing cold nitrogen gas has been developed which provides a cryogenic actively controlled shield at @xmath35 with sub - millikelvin temperature stability . </S>",
    "<S> an additional passive shield further dampens residual temperature fluctuations . adjusting the cryostat temperature to @xmath36 is quite cumbersome in the present setup , as no temperature sensor is attached to the silicon cavity to best preserve its vibration - insensitive mounting design and avoid local heating . only the temperature @xmath35 at the bottom of the actively controlled shield was measured . as there are temperature gradients across that shield , a cavity temperature @xmath28 corresponds to a temperature @xmath35 about @xmath37k below @xmath28 , which is taken into account in our analysis . </S>",

    "<S> were determined . to quickly increase @xmath27 , </S>",

    "<S> slightly overshot its zero - crossing temperature , settling at @xmath52mk within twenty days ( see fig.[fig : freq](b ) ) . at mark </S>",
    "<S> b a failure of the cryostat s temperature control interrupted the thermalization of the system leading to an increased temperature @xmath53 18  mk within the next days . shortly before </S>",
    "<S> the frequency comb became unavailable due to maintenance , a deliberate temperature decrease of the cryo - shield by @xmath54  mk ( mark c ) over one day was introduced to better approach @xmath28 . during the measurement period the temperature response of the silicon cavity was recorded via absolute frequency measurement of the laser stabilized to the cavity ( see fig.[fig : freq](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> from these data we have estimated the stability of the system : between the two intentional changes of the cryo - shield temperature between mark a and c , over 70 days the laser frequency remained within 600  hz , which would correspond to an average fractional frequency drift of @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> a more thorough investigation confirms this rough estimate : when plotting the laser frequency as a function of the calculated cavity temperature @xmath27 ( fig.[fig : freqvst ] ) the curve shows the expected parabolic dependency once a constant frequency drift of @xmath56  hz / d ( @xmath57/s ) is corrected in the data . </S>",
    "<S> possible causes for the residual negative drift corresponding to a change of optical length of @xmath58fm / d could be isothermal creep of the resonator mirror coatings or buildup of adsorbed layers from the residual gas on the mirror surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the minor deviation of an exact parabolic shape may be due to mechanical relaxations of the cavity mount as a result of the cryostat failure . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest drift was observed between day 56 and day 63 ( see inset of fig.[fig : freq](c ) ) , where the average frequency drift of the laser was @xmath59  @xmath60hz / s ( @xmath61 ) due to compensation of drift and temperature variation . the frequency instability compared to the hydrogen maser ( corrected for its drift by comparison to the cs fountain clock ) is shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the black dashed lines show the expected instabilities of a typical hydrogen maser and the @xmath22sr clock . </S>",
    "<S> the blue dotted line shows the allan deviation expected from thermal noise . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the laser instability for shorter averaging times was inferred from a frequency comparison with a @xmath0 lattice clock which was operational for several times in this time interval ( inset of fig.[fig : freq](c ) red traces ) . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation with frequency excursions observed with the maser indicates that the instability observed in fig .  4 above @xmath66  </S>",
    "<S> s is originating from the si - cavity laser . during these measurements </S>",
    "<S> the lattice clock instability was @xmath67 ; about a factor of two bigger than its optimal stability @xcite , as the duty cycle of the clock was reduced to lower the systematic uncertainties during a frequency comparison @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed instability of the si - cavity laser system is below @xmath68 for averaging times longer than one minute and reaches the @xmath69-level at averaging times above @xmath70  s. after that the instability varies depending on the actual frequency fluctuations of the laser that occur at the time the strontium clock was available for comparison .    </S>",
    "<S> the increase of laser instability between @xmath71  s and @xmath63  s is not yet understood and is not a property of the maser . </S>",
    "<S> although residual amplitude modulation ( ram ) from the fiber - coupled phase modulator is actively canceled in the setup @xcite , there might be uncompensated ram and frequency pulling of the cavity resonance from parasitic reflections . </S>",
    "<S> as the finesse of the tem@xmath72-mode was poor ( 80  000 ) , we employed the tem@xmath73-mode for cavity - locking @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus parasitic effects from beam pointing can not be ruled out as such effects had been observed previously . </S>",
    "<S> also temperature fluctuations during a day would show up at this time scale . in conclusion , with fractional frequency instabilities of @xmath1 for averaging times of @xmath2 to @xmath3 and @xmath4 the stability of this laser surpasses the best microwave standards for short averaging times . with an average daily drift of @xmath74 estimated from the two frequency values at the cte </S>",
    "<S> zero - crossing after points a and c , it outperforms the best cryogenic sapphire microwave oscillators showing @xmath75/d @xcite and its stability is also competitive with the best hydrogen masers for times of up to one day .    </S>",
    "<S> the demonstrated frequency stability of a silicon single - crystal stabilized laser in the different regimes of averaging times does not represent a fundamental limit . in a second silicon cavity system that is currently under construction </S>",
    "<S> , a higher finesse cavity will allow a corresponding reduction of the influence of ram and other parasitic effects that might result from the employment of the tem@xmath73-mode for cavity - locking . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown recently that the influence of the ram on the frequency stability can be further reduced to a fraction of @xmath76 of a cavity linewidth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this second cavity can be operated with reduced laser power , with less heating of the cavity from the absorbed laser power that currently amounts to @xmath77mk from @xmath78w absorbed power . </S>",
    "<S> an optimized distribution of improved temperature sensors will enable a more careful adjustment and monitoring of the cavity temperature .    with these optimizations </S>",
    "<S> it seems feasible to realize an ultra - stable oscillator that provides fractional frequency stabilities below @xmath79 from a second to a day . </S>",
    "<S> for example , such an ultra - stable oscillator would be useful in the comparison between optical frequency standards and primary cs clocks , that requires averaging times of several days to reach their uncertainty of @xmath80 . with the improvements now under way it will also be possible to elucidate the nature of the observed temporal drift rate of about @xmath56  hz / d . its constant value observed up to now would furthermore allow to apply a feed forward correction loop to achieve an even higher long - term stability . in the region of several days around day 60 ( fig . 2 c ) where the drift rate is compensated by another  </S>",
    "<S> presumably temperature  effect a fractional instability of @xmath81 was observed . </S>",
    "<S> as optical clocks still lack sufficient reliability for unattended long - term operation , the very small observed long - term drift rate will allow such a laser to act as a flywheel oscillator that could bridge longer gaps in measurement and which would facilitate comparisons between optical clocks and long - term measurement with microwave time standards . </S>"
