    "there have been extensive investigations of the phase diagrams of the various iron arsenide and chalcogenide structures that display high temperature superconductivity with critical temperatures up to 55 k  @xcite . in common with other unconventional superconductors , such as the copper oxides , heavy fermions , and organic charge - transfer salts ,",
    "superconductivity is induced by suppressing a magnetically ordered phase , which generates a high density of magnetic fluctuations that could theoretically bind the cooper pairs . whether this is responsible for the high transition temperatures",
    "has not been conclusively established , but it makes the origin of the magnetic interactions an important issue to be resolved  @xcite .    in nearly all the iron arsenides and chalcogenides , the iron atoms form a square planar net and the magnetic order",
    "consists of ferromagnetic stripes along one iron - iron bond direction that are antiferromagnetically aligned along the orthogonal iron - iron bond  @xcite .",
    "these systems are metallic and the fermi surfaces , which are formed by the iron 3@xmath0 electrons , are nearly cylindrical with hole pockets at the centre of the brillouin zone and electron pockets at the zone boundaries , all of similar size . in such an electronic structure ,",
    "interactions between electrons near the hole and electron pockets give rise to a spin density wave ( sdw ) order at the wavevector connecting the two pockets  @xcite .",
    "this itinerant picture is consistent with the wavevector of the observed antiferromagnetism , angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) measurements of the electronic structure  @xcite , and the evolution of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility with carrier concentration  @xcite .    however , any theory of the magnetic order also has to explain the structural transition which occurs at a temperature either just above or coincident with the sdw transition and lowers the symmetry from tetragonal ( @xmath6 ) to orthorhombic ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is often referred to as nematic order , and the relation between nematicity , magnetic order , and superconductivity has become one of the central questions in the iron - based superconductors  @xcite .    at present , there are two scenarios for the development of the nematic order and its relation to sdw order . in the first , the structural order is unrelated to magnetism and is driven by orbital ordering as the primary instability .",
    "the orbital ordering induces magnetic anisotropy and triggers the magnetic transition at a lower temperature by renormalizing the exchange constants  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is largely phenomenological , but there have been recent efforts to put it into a microscopic basis  @xcite .    in the second scenario ,",
    "the structural order is driven by magnetic fluctuations , associated with the fact that striped sdw order can be along the @xmath8-axis ( ordered momentum is @xmath9 ) or along the @xmath10-axis ( ordered momentum is @xmath11 ) .",
    "theory predicts that the @xmath12 symmetry between the @xmath13 and @xmath14 directions can be broken above the true sdw ordering temperature that breaks @xmath15 spin symmetry , _ i.e. _ , the system distinguishes between @xmath16 and @xmath17 without breaking time - reversal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the order parameter of this  ising - spin - nematic state \" couples linearly to the lattice , inducing both structural and orbital order .",
    "the magnetic scenario has been developed for itinerant  @xcite and localized  @xcite fermions , and the phase diagrams are rather similar in the two approaches .",
    "below we use the fact that the systems we study are metals and use an itinerant approach .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish the orbital and the magnetic scenarios since many of the observable properties are identical .",
    "we have now identified both theoretically and experimentally a new magnetic phase that can distinguish the two scenarios . by extending our previous analysis of the itinerant model to higher carrier concentrations",
    ", we have discovered that the phase diagram is richer than previously anticipated , based on the ginzburg - landau analysis near @xmath18 , and that there exists , in some range of parameters , an additional phase at @xmath2 , that restores @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the order parameter in this new phase combines @xmath16 _ and _ @xmath17 with equal weights . in the following ,",
    "we summarize the results of these calculations , which are explained in more detail in the supplementary information , and show experimental evidence for the predicted phase in a hole - doped superconductor , ba@xmath3na@xmath4fe@xmath5as@xmath5 .",
    "such a second transition is highly unlikely in the orbital scenario because the breaking of the symmetry between @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the pre - condition for a magnetic transition .",
    "we view the observation of the transition to an sdw state which does not break the symmetry between @xmath16 and @xmath17 as a strong indication that the nematic order is of magnetic origin rather than of orbital origin .",
    "the itinerant description of magnetism in iron - based superconductors is built upon the fact that the hole bands are centered around @xmath19 and the electron bands are centered at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "a spin susceptibility is logarithmically enhanced at momenta connecting hole and electron pockets , and sdw order develops even if the interaction is weak .",
    "the sdw order parameter is in general a combination of the two vector components @xmath22 and @xmath23 with momenta @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . for a model of perfect fermi surface nesting ( circular hole and electron pockets of equal radii ) and only electron - hole interactions",
    ", sdw order specifies @xmath26 but not the relative magnitudes and directions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "away from perfect nesting , the ellipticity of the electron pockets and interactions between the electron bands break the degeneracy and lower the symmetry of the sdw order . near @xmath18 ,",
    "an analysis within a ginzburg - landau expansion in powers of @xmath22 and @xmath23 shows that fourth - order terms select stripe magnetic order with either @xmath27 , @xmath28 , or @xmath29 , @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "such an order simultaneously reduces the lattice @xmath6 symmetry down to @xmath7 .",
    "the order parameter in the stripe phase is shown schematically in fig.[fig1](b ) .",
    "an issue that has not been discussed in detail until now is whether another magnetic ground state , in which both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are non - zero , may appear at a lower temperature , as a result of non - linear effects .",
    "this might happen either via a first - order transition , in which case the most likely outcome is the state in which @xmath31 ( see fig.[fig1](c ) ) , or via a second - order transition , in which case the second order parameter appears continuously and likely remains relatively small down to @xmath32 ( see fig.[fig1](d ) ) .",
    "to check for a potential second sdw transition , we extended the previous ginzburg - landau analysis to the entire temperature range by solving non - linear coupled mean - field equations for @xmath33 and @xmath34 and analyzing which solution minimizes the free energy .",
    "this has revealed new features in the phase diagram not previously identified . in particular",
    ", we find that sdw order with @xmath35 , which breaks @xmath15 spin symmetry but preserves lattice @xmath6 symmetry , does emerge at low @xmath1 , as the mismatch in hole and electron pocket sizes grows .     and two electron pockets at x and y , using the unfolded brillouin zone with one fe atom per unit cell .",
    "the arrows refer to two equivalent nesting wavevectors * q*@xmath36 and @xmath37 ( lower panel ) possible magnetic ground states of the fe - lattice : ( b ) the @xmath7 antiferromagnetic stripe phase with @xmath38 and @xmath39 ;",

    "( d ) magnetic order in which @xmath41 . note that the nel transition at low temperatures , @xmath42 , from phase ( b ) to phase ( c ) is first order , while the transition from phase ( b ) to phase ( d ) is of the second order in which an additional small component of @xmath43 appears below t@xmath44 .",
    "our experiments are more compatible with scenario ( c ) . [ fig1 ] ]    we obtained this result by analyzing the minimal three - band model with one hole and two electron pockets . for simplicity , we considered parabolic dispersions with @xmath45 where @xmath46 are band masses , @xmath47 is the offset energy , and @xmath48 is the chemical potential .",
    "the non - interacting hamiltonian takes the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 label the bands , the summation over repeated spin indices @xmath51 is assumed , and we shift the momenta of the fermions near the @xmath13 and @xmath14 fermi pockets by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , writing @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the interaction term in the hamiltonian @xmath54 contains all symmetry - allowed interactions between low - energy fermions , which include inter- and intra - band scattering processes  @xcite .",
    "we present the explicit form of @xmath54 in the supplementary information .",
    "the mean - field equations on @xmath22 and @xmath23 are obtained by introducing @xmath55 and @xmath56 and using them to decouple four - fermion terms into anomalous quadratic terms with inter - band `` hopping '' , which depends on @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we diagonalized the quadratic form , re - expressed @xmath57 in terms of new operators and obtained a set of two coupled self - consistent equations for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the blue points are the coincident antiferromagnetic and orthorhombic transition temperatures , @xmath18 , into the @xmath7 phase , and the red point is the observed transition temperature into the tetragonal @xmath6 phase , all measured by neutron diffraction .",
    "the green points are the superconducting transition temperatures , @xmath59 , determined from magnetization data .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    we solved the mean - field equations numerically as a function of two parameters , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see supplementary information for details ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 represents the mismatch in chemical potentials of the hole and electron pockets ( @xmath63 when the electron and hole pockets are identical ) .",
    "@xmath64 is proportional to the ellipticity of the electron pockets .",
    "we focused on the two sdw - ordered states the antiferromagnetic stripe state with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , in which @xmath6-symmetry is reduced to @xmath7 and on the sdw state with @xmath35 , in which @xmath6-symmetry is preserved .",
    "as we said , the two states are degenerate at zero ellipticity and perfect nesting , when @xmath65 .",
    "once the ellipticity becomes non - zero , the stripe state wins immediately below the neel temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath6-preserving state ( with @xmath35 ) is a local maximum and is unstable at @xmath66 .    by solving the equations at lower temperature",
    ", we found that , at a finite @xmath60 , the @xmath6-preserving state also becomes locally stable below some @xmath67 , and at an even lower @xmath68 , its free energy becomes smaller than that of the stripe phase , _",
    "i.e. _ , at @xmath69 the system undergoes a first - order phase transition in which lattice @xmath6 symmetry gets restored .",
    "( see fig.[fig1](c ) ) . because @xmath18 falls",
    "as the fermi surface mismatch @xmath60 increases , the new @xmath6-preserving phase in practice exists only in a narrow region of the phase diagram close to the suppression of sdw order .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "we also analyzed a four - pocket model with two hole pockets and found another scenario for a second sdw transition .",
    "namely , the af stripe order @xmath70 initially involves only fermions from a hole pocket which has higher density of states .",
    "below some @xmath71 , fermions near the remaining hole pocket and near the electron pocket at @xmath13 , not involved in the initial stripe order , also produce sdw instability , and the system gradually develops the second order parameter @xmath72 , which distorts the stripe af order .",
    "the corresponding low @xmath1 spin configuration is shown in fig.[fig1](d ) . in this case , however , the @xmath6 symmetry remains broken at all temperatures .",
    "our experimental data taken as a function of doping are more consistent with a first - order transition and restoration of @xmath6 symmetry ( see below ) .",
    "it is possible , however , that the second scenario is realized under pressure  @xcite .",
    "we are currently exploring the phase diagram of ba@xmath73na@xmath58fe@xmath5as@xmath5 using neutron and x - ray powder diffraction , following our recent investigation of the potassium - doped compounds  @xcite .",
    "details of the synthesis and characterization of the polycrystalline samples and the powder diffraction measurements are given in the methods section below .",
    "in both series , the addition of the alkali metal dopes holes into iron @xmath0-bands , which is equivalent to reducing the chemical potential , @xmath48 , in the model described above . this has the effect of reducing the transition temperature into the stripe phase from 139k , in the parent compound bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 , to 0 at @xmath74 in both the k - doped and na - doped series .",
    "one unusual feature of both series is that the antiferromagnetic and orthorhombic transitions are coincident and first - order over the entire phase diagram  @xcite , an observation that is quite unambiguous since both order parameters are determined from the same neutron powder diffraction measurement .",

    "we do not have as many data points in the sodium - doped system , but the phase diagram is extremely similar so we have assumed that the same scaling curve applies here as well .",

    "[ fig4 ] ]    the only member of the sodium series to show a significant departure from the potassium compounds is at @xmath86 close to the suppression of the af / o order , which has a superconducting transition temperature of 24k .",
    "the transition into the conventional @xmath7 phase occurs at 90k .",
    "however , at @xmath87k , there is a remarkable first - order phase transition , at which the sample phase separates into regions with two different atomic and magnetic structures .",
    "3(a ) shows the orthorhombic splitting of the ( 112 ) nuclear bragg peak at 90k and its recombination at @xmath42 marking the onset of a reentrant tetragonal phase .",
    "not all the sample transforms back to @xmath6 symmetry . from a multi - phase rietveld refinement",
    ", we estimate that approximately 40% of the sample remains in the orthorhombic phase below the transition ( fig .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that the whole sample is involved in the first - order transition even if only a fraction is transformed because , even within the orthorhombic phase , the in - plane lattice parameters relax below the transition ( fig .",
    "the in - plane lattice parameters show a reduction in the low - temperature @xmath7 phase with an increase in the @xmath88-axis lattice parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ , the high- and low - temperature @xmath7 phases are not identical .",
    "the @xmath6 phase shows the opposite trend , which means that the in - plane lattice parameter is slightly higher than above @xmath18 .",
    "the overall volume is roughly constant through the reentrant transition for both phases .",

    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic and orthorhombic order parameters are directly proportional ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) , as we saw in the k - doped series  @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence of phase competition above the reentrant transition since the moment in the low - temperature orthorhombic phase increases abruptly at the transition .",
    "the @xmath6 phase is also magnetically ordered .",
    "an unambiguous refinement of the magnetic structure will require measurements on single crystals , but possible solutions that are consistent with the structural space group ( @xmath77 ) and the lack of any in - plane magnetoelastic distortion are discussed in the supplementary information .",
    "they include the in - plane magnetic order illustrated in fig .",
    "1(c ) , as well as variants , in which the moments are aligned along the @xmath88-axis . since the theory does not include spin - orbit coupling , both solutions are theoretically allowed .",
    "it is important to distinguish these new results from previous observations of a reentrant tetragonal phase in electron - doped compounds , such as bafe@xmath89co@xmath58as@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "all those transitions were within the superconducting phase and have been convincingly shown to result from the competition between superconductivity and antiferromagnetic stripe order  @xcite .",
    "the reentrant phase that we report here occurs well above the superconducting transition temperature and so requires a different explanation .",
    "we are also unaware of any model of orbital order that would predict a reentrant non - orbitally - ordered phase at lower temperature .",
    "our results are broadly consistent with the itinerant model described above and are a natural consequence of magnetic order induced by the interaction between the hole and electron pockets suggested by the fermi surface geometry .",
    "the relaxation of the lattice parameters below the reentrant transition implies that there is some phase competition between the @xmath7 and @xmath6 phases in the high - temperature phase that is relieved below @xmath42 . in principle , this could be modeled theoretically by extending the mean - field theory calculations performed so far to the more microscopic theory .",
    "such a theory would be necessary to study a @xmath7 phase above the reentrant transition in which @xmath90 but both are non - zero .",
    "nevertheless , the prediction that a @xmath6 phase can become degenerate with the @xmath7 phase only at higher doping when the hole and electron fermi surfaces are not as well - matched in size , and that the stability of the @xmath6 phase would be limited to a very narrow region close to the suppression of antiferromagnetism is borne out by the new data .",
    "our results provide strong evidence for the validity of an itinerant model of nematic order in the iron - based superconductors , in which the orbital reconstruction of the iron @xmath91 states is a consequence of magnetic interactions induced by fermi surface nesting .",
    "whether nematic order , or at least strong nematic fluctuations , is a prerequisite for superconductivity is another challenge to address in the future .",
