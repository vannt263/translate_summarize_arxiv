    "theoretical investigation of solutions of _ mesoscopic _ particles - with sizes within the range 10 - 10@xmath8   - such as colloids , micelles and globular proteins , is more problematic than the study of fluids with atomic or simple molecular constituents - with sizes within the range 1 - 10   @xcite .",
    "the main difficulties are due to the large difference between solute and solvent molecular sizes , as well to the possible presence of high electric charges and large charge - asymmetries . treating mixtures of macroions and microions , with strong long - ranged coulombic forces ,",
    "represents a challenge for the most typical methods of the modern statistical - mechanical theory of fluids , namely monte carlo ( mc ) or molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulations and integral equations ( ie ) based on the ornstein - zernike equation coupled with approximate closures  @xcite . large size - asymmetries entail very different time scales in md simulations and may lead to ergodicity problems both in mc and md calculations .",
    "moreover , large size - differences imply several difficulties even when using ie theories .    for simplicity ,",
    "the present paper will be restricted to fluids of _ neutral _ particles with spherically symmetric interactions , neglecting all coulombic forces due to net electric charges .",
    "starting from a fluid mixture with one or more solute species ( big particles , or macroparticles ) and one solvent  species ( much smaller molecules or microparticles , which might be either a true solvent or polymer coils , smaller colloidal particles , etc . )",
    ", we will adopt an _ effective fluid _ approach , which eliminates all large size - asymmetries by averaging out the microscopic degrees of freedom corresponding to the solvent amokrane04,louis02 . as a consequence ,",
    "the influence of the solvent is incorporated into an _ _  effective _ _ potential for the interaction between big particles , and the initial mixture is reduced to a fluid made up of only solute molecules ( one or more components ) . usually , at the simplest level of description the effective potential",
    "includes , in addition to a steeply repulsive part , a very _ short - ranged attractive _ one ,",
    "whose range is a small fraction of the macroparticle size . recall that a force is said to be short - ranged  if it derives from a potential @xmath9 which vanishes as @xmath10 with @xmath11 when @xmath12 @xcite ; the force @xmath13 then decays as @xmath14 .",
    "this definition of short - ranged potentials is clearly related to the second virial coefficient @xmath15 which is a central quantity in our paper : when the forces are short - ranged in the above - mentioned sense , the integral which defines @xmath16 ( see eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) below ) is finite , whereas it diverges for long - ranged interactions , i.e.  when @xmath17 .",
    "note that the definition of short - ranged forces is not unique in the literature .",
    "for instance , in hirschfelder s classical reference book  @xcite short - range forces are the valence or chemical forces , arising from overlap of electron clouds at very short intermolecular separations .",
    "the potential of such repulsive , and often highly directional , forces varies exponentially with the distance @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "all potentials proportional to inverse powers of @xmath18 are called long - ranged  by hirschfelder note1 .",
    "once a reasonable approximation to the effective potential is known , it could be employed in both computer simulations or ie calculations .",
    "unfortunately , ies can be solved analytically only in very specific cases , for some potentials and within particular closures  @xcite . the simplest model with both repulsion and attraction which is analytically tractable refers to a fluid made up of hard spheres ( hs ) with an infinitely narrow and infinitely deep attractive tail .",
    "this highly idealized model of _ adhesive _ or _ sticky hard spheres _ ( shs ) was proposed by baxter @xcite , and admits an analytical solution within the percus - yevick ( py ) approximation @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding its crudeness and known shortcomings @xcite , the shs model is not a purely academic exercise .",
    "in fact , it has seen continuously growing interest in the last two decades , because of its ability to describe semiquantitatively many properties of real fluids of neutral spherical particles , such as colloidal suspensions , micelles , protein solutions , microemulsions , and systems exhibiting phase transitions of several types ( see for example refs . stell91,regnaut89,jamnik9601,santos98 and references therein ) .",
    "accurate simulation data for one - component shs have recently been reported by miller and frenkel @xcite .",
    "because of the simplicity of the shs model , it has often been suggested to model potentials comprising a hard core and short - ranged attractive tail by means of sticky potentials . to achieve",
    "this one needs to define an appropriate _ equivalence _ between the actual interaction and its _",
    "sticky representation_. this _ mapping _ of a generic short - ranged potential onto a shs interaction is usually accomplished by requiring the two different models to have equal second virial coefficients @xcite .",
    "moreover , when applied to mixtures , this approach requires a further step , and this is the main point addressed in the present work .    in a series of earlier papers gazzillo00,gazzillo02,gazzillo03,gazzillo04,gazzillo05",
    ", we investigated the multi - component shs model , focusing on its possible application to _ polydisperse _ colloidal suspensions , namely to mixtures where the number @xmath19 of components is so _ large _ that it can effectively be regarded as stemming from a continuous distribution .",
    "this is , for instance , the case of size polydispersity , where  in the discrete notation  a shs mixture",
    "is fully characterized by two sets of parameters , i.e. , the hs diameters @xmath20 and the stickiness  coefficients @xmath21 ( @xmath1 are baxter s parameters ) ; the latter depend on temperature @xmath6 and the strength of the interparticle adhesion .",
    "intuitively , one expects @xmath22 to depend on the diameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the interacting particles @xmath23 and @xmath24 , but it is not easy to specify _ a priori _ the correct functional form , and in our previous papers we attempted some reasonably motivated choices for such a dependence .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to investigate the relationship between stickiness coefficients and particles sizes , and thus to get new insights into the possible forms of the function @xmath25 starting from a physically sound basis . to achieve this",
    ", we will present an overview of the most important short - ranged attractive interactions occurring in real solutions of colloids or micelles . in doing this ,",
    "our claim is not to be fully exhaustive , but rather to gather sufficient physical information about the mechanisms which cause short - ranged attractive interactions in solutions of mesoscopic particles , and the corresponding simplest model potentials used for their representation .    by considering several different systems  dispersion forces , depletion forces , polymer - coated colloids , solvation forces ( in particular , hydrophobic interactions , and reverse micelles in water - in - oil microemulsions )",
    " we have surprisingly found strong similarities among the simplest models employed to represent this wide variety of physical phenomena . by constructing , for each of the relevant potentials , an equivalent shs representation",
    ", we will deduce and compare the corresponding expressions for @xmath26 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we will introduce the basic formalism , concerning the second virial coefficient , the baxter shs model , and the mapping rule for getting the equivalent shs potential from a given short - ranged attraction .",
    "sections iii is dedicated to the direct van der waals interaction , while sections iv , v and vi survey the most important short - ranged attractions that are indirect , i.e.  mediated by the solvent .",
    "the hydrophobic effect and interactions between reverse micelles will be considered in section vi , as particular cases of solvation forces . for each model potential ,",
    "a reasonable approximation to the corresponding @xmath27 will be calculated .",
    "finally , a summary , with a brief discussion , and our conclusions will be given in section vii .",
    "for a multi - component fluid , the second virial coefficient of the osmotic pressure reads @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the molar fraction of species @xmath23 , and the partial second virial coefficient for the @xmath30 interaction is given by@xmath31with@xmath32 -1   \\label{v3}\\]]being the mayer function , @xmath33 , @xmath34 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath6 the absolute temperature .",

    "( [ b2 ] ) shows that , if the well is narrow @xmath52 , @xmath53 can be significantly different from @xmath54 only when the attraction is strong enough @xmath55    unfortunately , despite the simplicity of the sw model , no satisfactory analytical solution of the resulting ies has been found so far .",
    "however , such a solution _ can _ be found within the percus - yevick ( py ) approximation for a special limiting case , when the well width @xmath56 goes to zero but the depth @xmath57 goes to infinity in such a way that the contribution of the attraction to the second virial coefficient remains finite and different from zero ( baxter s sticky limit ) @xcite . the short - ranged attraction becomes a surface adhesion , and the particles of the resulting model",
    "are thus named _ adhesive _ or _ sticky hard spheres_. from eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) one sees that baxter s condition on @xmath58 requires the product @xmath59to be independent of @xmath56 for small @xmath56 , and this leads to the following condition for the sw depth @xmath60as previously mentioned , our @xmath22 is simply related to baxter s original parameter @xmath1 by @xmath61here , @xmath22 measures the strength of surface adhesiveness or stickiness  between particles of species @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and must be an unspecified _ decreasing _ function of @xmath62 in fact , as @xmath63 one must also have @xmath64 , in order to recover the correct hs limit .",

    "the vdw attraction is almost exclusively determined by the dispersion forces ; the latter are in fact the only contribution to the vdw forces if both molecules are nonpolar .      the _ dispersion _ or _ london _ forces are _ induced - dipole / induced - dipole _ interactions , whose potential is given by the london formula @xcite",

    "this _ polarizability effect _",

    "such a deep attractive potential would lead to irreversible association or flocculation  of the suspended particle .",
    "this effect can be avoided in one of two different ways , namely by _ charge stabilization _ or _",
    "steric stabilization_. in the first case , some surface chemical groups of the particles become partially ionized in water , and the resulting electrostatic repulsion makes close contact impossible . in the second case , stabilization is achieved by grafting polymer chains ( hair ) to the particle surfaces .",

    "polymer - coated colloidal particles will have fully - extended hair and thus the largest hs diameter possible , corresponding to the strongest solute - solute repulsion .    in a poor solvent , on the other hand ,",
    "the polymer - solvent attractions are weak .",
    "now it is the temperature that determines the solute - solute interaction . at @xmath206",
    "the hair will be fully - extended , as in good solvents ( hs behavior ) . at low temperatures",
    "@xmath207 the polymer segments find their own environment more satisfying than that provided by the solvent .",
    "this preference may produce more compact globular  configurations , in which intra - chain polymer - polymer contacts occur more frequently ( curly hair ) . in an alternative view , when two solute particles are in close contact , a high number of polymer - polymer attractions is favored by the interpenetration of the two polymeric layers .    in the literature on sterically - stabilized colloids",
    "kruif89,verduin95,duits91 , the attractive part of the potential for one - component _ hairy hard spheres _ ( hhs ) - due to the polymer - polymer interactions between surface layers of different particles - was described by a sw , with a depth proportional to the ( maximum ) _ overlap volume _ of the layers and temperature - dependent in analogy with the flory - krigbaum model for polymer segments @xcite .",
    "the sw width equals the length of interpenetration of the stabilizing chains , whose maximum value coincides with the thickness @xmath210 of polymeric layer .    for mixtures , we could consider the most direct extension of the one - component sw model .",
    "in such a case , using eq .",
    "( [ b10 ] ) , a sw potential could immediately be mapped onto a shs one:@xmath211 \\ \\frac{1}{3}\\left [ \\left ( 1+\\delta _ { ij}^{\\mathrm{sw}}\\right ) ^{3}-1\\right ] .",

    ". thus the form of @xmath224ensures that the high - temperature condition ( [ b5 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "an indirect interaction between solute particles may also arise from solvation . to picture solvation effects , gurney @xcite and frank and evans @xcite introduced the physically intuitive concept of _ cosphere _ or _",
    "layer_. one supposes that any isolated solute particle is surrounded by some region in which the solvent has different properties than the bulk solvent , since its structure is markedly affected by the presence of the solute : some of the solvent - solvent bonds have been broken by the introduction of the foreign  particle .",
    "clearly , such a region has no well - defined boundary , but gurney s model assumes that significant effects come from only the few solvent molecules that are directly next to the solute particles , i.e. , in a spherical shell whose thickness @xmath225 is taken to be a few solvent diameters or even the size of only one solvent molecule ( for water , a molecular diameter of @xmath226   is acceptable ) .",
    "this picture was first applied to electrolyte solutions by friedman and coworkers @xcite . in the ionic case , however , the previous definition of cosphere , with the same thickness for every ionic species , may be too restrictive , since the solvation region may extend even outside the cosphere , as occurs for very small ions ( li@xmath227 , and polyvalent ions such as mg@xmath228 , ca@xmath228 , etc . ) .",
    "when two solute particles @xmath23 and @xmath24 approach sufficiently closely for their solvation layers to overlap , some of the cosphere solvent is displaced .",
    "furthermore , the overlapping region contains solvent molecules which are now affected by the combined force field of two solutes ,  so that its structure might even differ from that of each isolated cosphere .",
    "the whole process , in which the sum of the cosphere volumes is reduced by overlap and the solvent relaxes to its normal bulk state , will be accompanied by a gibbs free energy change .",
    "if the solvent molecules in the isolated solvation layers are in a state of lower free energy than those in the bulk , the overlap of two cospheres with the consequent expulsion of solvent gives rise to a free energy increase , and the resulting contribution to the interaction between two solutes is repulsive .",
    "when the solvent molecules in the solvation layers are in a state of higher free energy than those in the bulk , the expulsion of solvent from the overlapping region leads to a free energy decrease . in this case , both the free energy and the disruption of solvent structure are minimized when two solute particles @xmath23 and @xmath24 are brought close together , causing a net @xmath30 attraction .",
    "because of the lack of knowledge about the properties of the solvent in the solvation region , it is difficult to construct a detailed and physically sound microscopic model of the effects described above . adopting a heuristic approach , friedman and coworkers",
    "@xcite proposed that the free energy change accompanying the cosphere overlapping of two hs solute particles @xmath23 and @xmath24 gives rise to the _ gurney potential , _ defined by@xmath229here the gurney parameter @xmath230 is in general a function of temperature @xmath231 and pressure @xmath19 and represents the molar free energy of transfer of solvent from the overlapping region of the @xmath30 cospheres to the bulk .",
    "as previously discussed , @xmath232 corresponds to attraction .",
    "furthermore , @xmath233 is the mean volume of a solvent molecule , while the volume of solvent returning to the bulk is given by the intersection volume of the cospheres surrounding the two solute hs at distance @xmath18 , namely @xmath234 .",
    "the free - energy parameters @xmath235 were determined numerically by fitting the model to experimental data .",

    "this _ hydrophobic attraction _ between nonpolar entities , which occurs exclusively in water , has - to a large extent - an _ entropic _ origin , related to the strong tendency of water molecules to form hydrogen bonds and associate kleman03 .",
    "the physical mechanisms underlying the solvation forces are rather well understood when the solvent is water .",
    "polar molecules or polar groups of a solute feel strong attraction towards water molecules , and thus are said to be _ hydrophilic _ ( water - loving ) .",
    "on the other hand , nonpolar molecules or nonpolar groups dislike  water , and are called _ hydrophobic _ ( water - hating , or water - avoiding ) .",
    "the _ hydrophobic effect _ means that nonpolar particles have an extremely weak solubility in water , since inserting one of them - a noble gas atom , a chlorine or oxygen molecule , a hydrocarbon molecule , etc . - into water may actually lead to an increase of gibbs free energy , i.e. , @xmath240 .",
    "indeed , the formation of a new cavity requires the breaking of many water - water hydrogen bonds with a considerable @xmath241 , which can not be compensated by the small @xmath242 provided by the new solute - water vdw interactions ( the nonpolar solute can not participate in the formation of hydrogen bonds ) .",
    "then , in order to get a further decrease of @xmath243 , the water molecules close to the solute reorient themselves , so as to create as many hydrogen bonds with adjacent water molecules as possible .",
    "the result is the formation of a cage  - or hydration layer - around the solute , with more rigid water - water bonds than in the bulk .",
    "such an additional _ ordering _ in the solvent , brought about by the introduction of a solute molecule , implies a significant entropy decrease , @xmath244 , and thus a strong positive contribution @xmath245 to the total @xmath246 of solution at constant @xmath6 and @xmath19 .",
    "this explains why nonpolar particles are hydrophobic : one gets @xmath247 when the entropic contribution dominates over the entalpic one @xmath248 , which is usually small and may be positive or negative . on the other hand , at higher temperatures the solubility increases , and one may find @xmath249 in fact , @xmath250 becomes much smaller , because the molecular thermal motion struggles more efficiently against the structure formation around a nonpolar solute .",
    "the same hydrophobic effect is responsible for the above - mentioned _ hydrophobic bonding _",
    ", where nonpolar parts of molecules or ions tend to aggregate .",
    "in fact , the solvent molecules prefer mutual contacts over those with the foreign  substance ( solute ) , while the aggregation of solutes reduces the total volume of their cages , minimizing the loss of entropy .",
    "the hydrophobic interaction arises when overlap of hydration - layers occurs , and becomes increasingly attractive as the distance between two solute particles decreases .",
    "this phenomenon in acqueous solutions of alcohols was studied by friedman and krishnan @xcite , who used a model potential containing a repulsive term of the @xmath251form , plus an attractive gurney term given by eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , representing the overlap between cospheres . for the sustances they considered",
    ", these authors found values of the gurney coefficient @xmath252 in the range @xmath253 to @xmath254 .",
    "the cosphere thickness @xmath225 was taken to be @xmath255 , corresponding to one molecular layer of water .",
    "clark _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the same physical systems with a more refined model , including a core potential based upon lennard - jones potentials for individual atom - atom interactions and again a gurney term for the hydrophobic attraction .",
    "they found a minimum @xmath256 @xmath42 in their potentials of average force , that implies an overall tendency for those alcohols to associate when in an aqueous environment .",
    "hydrophobic bonding is very important in interface and colloid science .",
    "it is often the driving force behind the way in which biomolecules organize themselves and it is responsible for the formation of micelles , bimolecular layers , and lamellar structures",
    ".      molecules having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts are said to be _ amphiphilic _ ( dual - loving , in the sense of being both water - lovingand water - hating ; from the greek @xmath257 = on both sides ) .",
    "an important example is provided by relatively short chain molecules with an ionizable or polar ( thus hydrophilic ) head - group and a nonpolar ( thus hydrophobic ) tail , consisting of one or several flexible hydrocarbon chain(s ) .",
    "since these molecules can significantly lower the surface tension of a solution , they are generically called _ surfactants _ or _ surface - active agents _ barrat03,lyklema00,bennaim80 .",
    "when immersed in water , the head - group may become negatively or positively charged , or it remains polar with no net electric charge .",
    "accordingly , the surfactants are classified as _ anionic , cationic _ or _ non - ionic_.    clearly , it is the hydrophilic head - group that keeps a surfactant solute dissolved in the water .",
    "the hydrophobic tail tends to avoid contact with water and to seek , as far as possible , a nonaqueous environment .",
    "the longer the hydrophobic tail , the poorer the solubility in water and , hence , the greater the tendency of the surfactant to escape from the acqueous solution . consequently , as the solute concentration increases , a phase - separation may occur .",
    "alternatively , the surfactant molecules accumulate at interfaces between water and other liquids or gases , or spontaneously _ self - assemble _ into supramolecular aggregates of mesoscopic size that minimize the number of contacts between water and hydrocarbon tails and maximize the number of tail - tail interactions .",
    "if a surfactant is added to pure water under atmospheric pressure , its molecules first form a monolayer film at the water - air interface , with polar heads pointing towards the water and tails exposed to the air . above a certain concentration of surfactant ( _ critical micellization concentration _ ) , one finds an abrupt change in the properties of the solution ; in fact , now the solute particles in the bulk begin to form supramolecular aggregates like micelles , planar lamellar bilayers , and vesicles , whose size and shape are , to a large extent , determined by the geometric properties of the surfactant molecules @xcite .",
    "these ( _ direct _ ) _  micelles _ have a nearly spherical structure , in which the head - groups are placed at the surface and are thus exposed to the aqueous environment , whereas the nonpolar tails occupy the interior of the micelle , avoiding any contact with water .    a surfactant , when added to a mixture of water and oil ( an organic liquid immiscible with water ) , forms monolayers at every water - oil interface .",
    "several disordered or partially ordered phases are possible , depending on temperature and surfactant concentration . in particular",
    ", one can get a _ microemulsion _ , which is a two - phase suspension of finely divided droplets of _ oil in water _ ( o / w ) , or _",
    "water in oil _",
    "( w / o ) , depending on the relative concentration of the two liquids .",
    "each droplet is coated with a monolayer film of surfactant , which separates water from oil . in w / o microemulsions",
    "one finds _ reverse _ ( or _ inverted _ ) _ micelles _ , where the core is formed by a droplet of water , and the surrounding surfactant molecules now have the head - groups inside the micelle , in contact with water , while their hydrocarbon tails point towards the outside oil phase @xcite .",
    "clearly , such flexible tails resemble the polymer - hair of sterically stabilized colloids , but in reverse micelles the number of chains is lower and thus a large amount of oil can penetrate the surfactant - layer . for the sake of simplicity , we do not consider the possible presence of a cosurfactant , which is generally an alcohol and mixes with surfactant in the outside layer .    in most models for w / o microemulsions the suspending medium , containing mainly oil , is treated as a continuous phase , and the reverse micelles are represented as composed of two parts . the internal one , including both the water droplet and surfactant head - groups , is assumed to be a spherical and impenetrable core , with hs radius @xmath258 .",
    "the external part consists of a concentric , _ penetrable _ spherical layer , with thickness equal to the length @xmath210 of the aliphatic chains of surfactant in their fully - extended conformation .",
    "thus the total radius of a micelle is @xmath259 . because of the flexibility of the chains , @xmath210 has sometimes been allowed to depend on temperature , i.e. , @xmath260 bouaskarne01 .",
    "the short - ranged attraction between reverse micelles seems to be mainly determined by the overlapping of the penetrable surfactant - layers during collisions @xcite .",
    "the interpenetration of the aliphatic chains of the surfactant induces oil removal .",
    "now , the partial molar volume of oil inside the surfactant - layer is expected to be larger than in the pure oil - phase ( this effect is related to the volume of ch@xmath261 and ch@xmath262groups in the aliphatic layers ) .",
    "a difference of @xmath263 @xmath264 seems to be sufficient to explain an interaction potential compatible with light scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "roux and bellocq @xcite proposed the simplest model for equal - sized micelles , assuming that the interaction potential is proportional to the overlap volume .",
    "the extension of their formula to mixtures is immediate .",
    "according to our terminology , the resulting expression is equivalent to a particular gurney potential , i.e. , @xmath265where @xmath266 is an adjustable parameter which depends only on the oil .",
    "more refined models also include a hamaker - vdw attraction between water cores .",
    "electrostatic contributions and other more complicated terms have not been considered in the present paper .",
    "we have started from the problem of building up statistical mechanical models for fluid mixtures of mesoscopic particles , like colloids , micelles or globular proteins , by using very simple _ effective _ potentials containing a hs repulsion plus a short - ranged attractive tail that represent the interaction between big particles after averaging out the microscopic degrees of freedom related to much smaller molecules ( solvent , added polymers , etc . ) .",
    "the simplest tail corresponds to the highly idealized _ surface adhesion _ , modeled through a @xmath267-term , of the shs potential .",
    "since we are interested in multicomponent shs fluids , and in the past difficulties had been encountered in choosing their stickiness parameters @xmath22 , the present paper has focused on the relationship between @xmath22 and particle sizes , i.e. , on the possible functional forms of @xmath268 . to elucidate this issue",
    "we have regarded the shs potentials as models that may be derived , with some simplification , from more realistic interactions .",
    "the idea of associating an _ equivalent _ shs representation to a realistic interaction , by requiring the equality of the second virial coefficients , is already known and widely accepted . we have chosen this mapping based upon the virial equivalence because of its simplicity and partial analytical tractability . since @xmath269yields only the first correction of pressure with respect to ideality , one can reasonably expect that the performance of the resulting shs model should worsen with increasing density . by requiring the equivalence of quantities different from @xmath269",
    ", one could obtain alternative mappings and generally different values for the effective parameters , leading to more successful results at high densities .",
    "an application of such an idea was given for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the solvent molecules were modeled as shs by requiring the equivalence of structural properties , i.e.  the solvent - solvent structure factor and the coordination number .",
    "unfortunately , this approach does not admit an analytical treatment , and a comparison with it goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "our aim was to investigate the most interesting cases of short - ranged attractive interactions for some paradigmatic physical systems . to provide a physically sound basis for the choice of @xmath22 and , in particular , its dependence on the particle diameters , we have presented a detailed and self - contained overview on several topics related to short - ranged attractive interactions in real mixtures of neutral mesoscopic particles .",
    "we have considered : i ) the van der waals or dispersion forces - direct interactions - and three cases with indirect , solvent - mediated , attractions : ii ) depletion forces , iii ) polymer - coated colloids , and iv ) solvation forces ( in particular , hydrophobic bonding and interactions between reverse micelles in water - in - oil microemulsions ) .    due to obvious analytical difficulties , our analysis has been restricted to the determination of the leading terms of @xmath22 .",
    "these have been evaluated by series expansion of the mayer function that appears in the second virial coefficient .",
    "we have discussed in particular the linear , quadratic and cubic approximations and their respective ranges of validity .",
    "the main result is that - in almost all cases considered - the leading contributions to @xmath22 can be expressed as@xmath270 \\allowbreak + c_{2}\\left [ m_{ij}(x, ... )\\ \\frac{\\sigma _ { i}\\sigma _ { j}}{\\sigma _ { ij}^{2}}\\right ] ^{2}+\\cdots ,   \\label{co1}\\]]where - in most scenarios - @xmath271 is the temperature @xmath6 , and the property@xmath272ensures that the _ high - temperature condition _ of eq .",
    "( [ b5 ] ) is satisfied . in the case of the depletion attraction ,",
    "@xmath271 coincides with the packing fraction @xmath7 of the depletant particles . for hairy hs ,",
    "both @xmath273 and @xmath274 are variables included in @xmath275 . as regards the dependence of @xmath22 on the big particle sizes - which was the basic question of the present work - , it is remarkable that @xmath22 can be expressed as a simple polynomial in the variable @xmath276",
    ". a quadratic approximation may already be sufficient .",
    "the only case in which the expression for @xmath22 differs from that given in eq .",
    "( [ co1 ] ) is the sutherland model for polarizable hs , which yields@xmath167 ^{2}+8\\left [ \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{h}}}{t}\\left ( \\frac{% \\sigma _ { i}\\sigma _ { j}}{\\sigma _ { ij}^{2}}\\right ) ^{3}\\right ] ^{3}.\\]]it is pleasant that even here we find powers of the same _ basic size - dependent factor _ ,",
    "note that this factor has the property that the sticky attraction vanishes when at least one of the two particles @xmath23 and @xmath24 becomes a point , i.e. , it satisfies the _ point - limit _ _ condition _ @xmath278this condition would be expected to hold for any interaction of adhesive  type which in the limit involves a particle surface of vanishing area @xcite .    the similarity among most of the resulting expressions for @xmath279 can easily be understood .",
    "in fact , most of the different short - ranged attractions considered here have been explained - by different authors - in terms of quite similar models , where mesoscopic particles are represented as hard spheres with a surrounding , concentric spherical _ layer _",
    "( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . in the ao case",
    "this layer is characterized somewhat indirectly by the fact that the density of the centers of mass of the depletant polymers is zero inside the layer but has a nonzero value outside it . in the other cases ,",
    "the layer has a clearer physical reality . for polymer - coated colloids , for example",
    ", the layer is the polymeric film grafted on the colloidal surface . in the hydrophobic bonding the layer is formed by the solvation water molecules . for reverse micelles ,",
    "the core comprising the water droplet and the polar heads of surfactants is surrounded by a layer made up of hydrocarbon tails of surfactants plus a certain quantity of oil .",
    "it is very appealing , and somewhat surprising , that the factor @xmath5 appears even in our result for the hamaker potential , which refers to a direct interaction where no spherical layer around the solutes is involved .",
    "note that this dependence on the particle diameters is clearly due to the hamaker integration , since for point - dipoles at the centre of hard spheres ( polarizable hs ) we have found a different factor , i.e. , @xmath280    we remark that the models we have considered can be divided into two different classes .",
    "the first one includes the two models of dispersion forces ( hamaker potential and polarizable hs ) , with the common feature of having an attractive @xmath151 tail .",
    "the second class refers to the solvent - mediated attractions ( depletion effects , polymer - coated colloids , solvation forces ) . here",
    ", we have reported the simplest examples , which can be regarded as variants of one single model : hard spheres with a penetrable concentric spherical layer ( ` cosphere ' , in a wider sense ) . as a consequence ,",
    "since the attraction depends on the volume overlap of the cospheres , the potentials of all these models are ` truncated ' , i.e.  they are rigorously zero beyond some characteristic distance .",
    "the main difference between the above mentioned classes  infinite tail in the first , finite tail in the second  might suggest that the idea of representing realistic potentials by an equivalent shs model is justifiable for the second class , but somewhat more questionable when the tail is infinite .",
    "in particular , since a proper treatment of long tails is essential for thermodynamics , the shs - mapping of the hamaker and sutherland potentials might introduce some qualitative differences in such a kind of properties .",
    "this viewpoint is certainly correct and hamaker and sutherland potentials should be appropriately distinguished from the remaining models of this paper .",
    "in fact , an ` exact ' treatment of all these models would surely yield very different thermodynamic and structural predictions .",
    "nevertheless , in our context the @xmath281-mapping onto shs can be expected to yield a representation of realistic interactions that is simple , analytically tractable , and reliable in appropriate regimes , at low and intermediate densities .    in a companion paper @xcite , we have applied a perturbative approach to the solution of the polydisperse shs model within the percus - yevick approximation .",
    "the suggestions put forward in the present paper regarding the relationship between stickiness and size , could help to improve the necessary input to that kind of scheme .    in conclusion , the present paper suggests - for multicomponent shs models - the expression for @xmath22 given by eq .",
    "( [ co1 ] ) as a simple choice that is physically justified by its relation to the above - mentioned models of real interactions .",
    "clearly , eq . ( [ co1 ] ) is an _ approximate _ result , but we believe that it correctly includes the _ leading terms _ of the dependence of @xmath22 on the particle sizes . in spite of the rather drastic approximations used here , this could be useful with the rationale of having a simple and tractable representation of rather complex interactions , at the simplest possible level of description .",

    "<S> we consider : i ) van der waals attractions , ii ) hard - sphere - depletion forces , iii ) polymer - coated colloids , iv ) solvation effects ( in particular hydrophobic bonding and attractions between reverse micelles of water - in - oil microemulsions ) . </S>",
    "<S> we map each of these potentials onto an equivalent shs model , by requiring the equality of the second virial coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the main finding is that , for most of the potentials considered , the size - dependence of @xmath4 can be approximated by essentially the same expression , i.e.  a simple polynomial in the variable @xmath5 , with coefficients depending on the temperature @xmath6 , or  for depletion interactions  on the packing fraction @xmath7 of the depletant particles . </S>"
