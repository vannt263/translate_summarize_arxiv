    "@xcite nonmagnetic impurities do not affect superconducting properties in zero magnetic field .",
    "however , it was shown later by markowitz and kadanoff@xcite that @xmath7 is actually reduced in the presence of gap anisotropy and impurity scattering .",
    "an application to a two - band model is due to golubov and mazin .",
    "@xcite indeed , they predicted a rather drastic decrease of @xmath7 due to the interband impurity scattering .",
    "they also found that , as the interband scattering increases , the density of states changes from the two - gap structure inherent to the two - band model to the conventional single - gap structure .",
    "this reduction of @xmath7 has been confirmed recently by a couple of experiments .",
    "etal._@xcite measured the specific heat of polycrystalline mgb@xmath0 after irradiation .",
    "they found both suppression of @xmath7 and a tendency towards a single - gap structure as the scattering is increased by irradiation .",
    "etal._@xcite clarified the possibility of complete suppression of superconductivity by replacing b in mgb@xmath0 by c. however , few quantitative calculations have been performed on the impurity effects based on a realistic model for mgb@xmath0.@xcite for example , the specific heat has been calculated by choi _",

    "<S> we study nonmagnetic impurity effects in mgb@xmath0 using the quasiclassical equations of superconductivity for a weak - coupling two - band model . </S>",
    "<S> parameters in the model are fixed so as to reproduce experiments on mgb@xmath0 as closely as possible . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle density of states and the specific heat are calculated for various values of the interband impurity scattering . the density of states changes gradually from a two - gap structure into the conventional single - gap structure as the interband scattering increases . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the excitation threshold is not a monotonic function of the interband scattering . </S>",
    "<S> calculated results for the specific heat are in good agreements with experiments on samples after irradiation . </S>"
