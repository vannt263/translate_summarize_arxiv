    "about 1960 , a change in education and evaluation of general phenomenological thermodynamics was observed . before 1960",
    ", it was mainly based on arguments by carnot , kelvin and clausius .",
    "after 1960 , it was mainly based on the gibbs distribution of statistical mechanics .",
    "this gibbs rational thermodynamics has the following priors for a system of interacting structureless particles :    1 .",
    "the only general entities are the particles ; the rational is obtained from the thermodynamic limit : number of particles @xmath11 under the condition of finite density ( @xmath12 given ) , 2 .",
    "there is a large heat reservoir that feeds the temperature @xmath13 as an equivalence - class index into the system , 3 .",
    "the non - fluctuation of the reservoir temperature , @xmath14 , is transferred into the definition of the general temperature ( to justify the sharp @xmath15 denominator in the boltzmann factor for energy in the gibbs distribution ) .",
    "these priors are tried and tested in systems where the spatial infinities , sufficiently separated from the particles , are contained inside the system itself , quasi as an internal heat reservoir .",
    "examples are the infinite lattice in a solid or an infinite vacuum of vacuum elements in a gas with isolated particles imbedded .",
    "we ask , whether these priors can be applied to liquids , especially to liquid dynamics , where such separated infinities are not obvious .",
    "the existence of two experimentally well - tried particularities could be useful for cosmology by starting the universe from an initial liquid ( initial liquid hypothesis ) .",
    "smaller ones ( glarum levy defects for dynamic heterogeneity of the dynamic glass transition , @xmath0 defect as a new entity ) could be the seeds for the later galaxies @xmath7 we use now the symbol @xmath16 for their number in the universe @xmath7 , and a larger one ( fischer speckle ) could be the largest causal region  in the initial liquid , wherefrom the increasing diameter @xmath17 of the expanding universe results .    in the dispersion zone of the dynamic glass transition of a classical molecular liquid , the @xmath0 defects must dynamically be described by a levy distribution with a levy exponent @xmath18 , @xmath19 for relaxation ( frequency @xmath20rad / s ) .",
    "this follows from the representativeness theorem ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "the difference @xmath21 is called tilt and is later related to the tilt @xmath22 of the spectral index @xmath23 in cosmic density fluctuations .",
    "the preponderant component of the levy sum for @xmath24 corresponds to a levy diffusion step of a molecule through the cage door of its nearest neighbor particles .",
    "a relation between the small @xmath0 defects and the large @xmath1 speckle is obtained via an  analytic continuation  of the diffusion steps .",
    "if the application to the cosmological initial liquid is reliable , a relation results between the number of galaxies @xmath16 in the universe of diameter @xmath3 and the tilt @xmath22 .",
    "all this is worded by the phrase  shaping power of levy distribution  .",
    "the thermodynamic entity is the key concept of this second paper second part .",
    "this entity is defined dynamically by a representative containing one @xmath0 defect which is formally labeled by one boltzmann constant @xmath25 from an internal quantum mechanical experiment of nyquist ( 1928 ) , cf .",
    "the remark of section 3.1 .",
    "the internal experiment is a  self - experiment  in the liquid @xmath7 without any reservoir and without any conscious observer @xmath7 that is thermodynamically described by the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) .",
    "this self - experiment may be understood as a common filter construction of the hidden charge model @xcite , common in relation to several particles , or to quantums in a nyquist transmission line . in the model , a common filter  construction from several eigensolutions",
    "must be allowed for the construction of e.g. a baryon : from a 1-class lepton , a 2-class prebaryon and a 3-class confinon eigensolution .",
    "the entity is , so to speak , a common thermodynamic  culminating event  of the model .",
    "the term defect diffusion was introduced by glarum @xcite . an experimental retardation function that could later be identified with the characteristic function of the symmetric levy distribution",
    "was detected by kohlrausch @xcite in 1847 .",
    "many experimental hints of the connection of glass relaxation data with an underlying levy distribution where collected , e.g. by ngai @xcite .",
    "a theoretical review was e.g. by shlesinger @xcite .",
    "the fischer dispersion zone @xcite and his speckles @xcite are reviewed by himself .",
    "the levy character of the defects was further developed in the book @xcite containing also the representativeness theorem .",
    "the fdt as an equation for thermodynamic self - experiments was developed on the base of the nyquist model @xcite , first in 1982 @xcite and later sophisticated in @xcite .",
    "glass transition arguments were used in cosmology e.g. in the paper of she @xcite .",
    "the hidden charge model is discussed in part 1 @xcite .",
    "in classical liquids , local glarum - levy defects ( @xmath0 defects ) are necessary , densily neighbored dynamic phenomena .",
    "the levy property is a consequence of the representativeness theorem ( section 3.1 ) , their locality ( finite volume , equation ( [ eq.2.2 ] ) below ) is a consequence of the local high - frequency break throughs they are (  levy instability ",
    "@xcite , otherwise a general negative pressure would be obtained ) , and the dense arrangement is a consequence of their mutual coexistence condition emerging from spatial aspects of the individual levy damping factors ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 defects are connected with thermodynamic (= internal quantum mechanical ) self - experiments .",
    "@xmath7 on the other hand , the rational gibbs thermodynamics is not the consequence of such a self - experiment , if a large external heat reservoir @xmath7 i.e. a macroscopic apparatus or observer @xmath7 is considered to be necessary .",
    "the absence of infinitive attributes for self - experiments means that there are no further restrictions to equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "then the @xmath0-defect entity can be connected with an internal temperature fluctuation @xmath27 .",
    "the rational gibbs thermodynamics has no such a @xmath27 , because @xmath28 is supposed , and new entities ( besides the particles ) can not be described there .",
    "von laue [ @xcite (  112 ) ] suggested a thermodynamics for two independent pairs of variables ( entropy @xmath29 and temperature @xmath13 , volume @xmath30 and pressure @xmath31 ) that allows to calculate the average temperature fluctuation of a representative subsystem :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the extensive heat capacity , @xmath34=$ ] j / k , and defines the size of the subsystem .",
    "the smallest representative ( in the time scale of the dynamic glass transition ) contains one @xmath0 defect @xmath7 otherwise it would not be representative @xmath7 , its characteristic volume is therefore @xcite    @xmath35    where the index @xmath36 means the main transition , i.e. the dispersion zone of the dynamic glass transition ; the small letter @xmath37 is the specific heat capacity , @xmath38=$ ] j / kg@xmath39k . the cubic root of @xmath40 is called the characteristic length , @xmath41 .",
    "the characteristic volume can be determined by dynamic heat capacity , e.g. @xcite , similar results are obtained from dynamic compressibility , @xmath42 . for high temperatures ( and frequencies ) a characteristic volume of order the volume one molecule is obtained , for low temperature near the conventional glass temperature @xmath43 , the order of 100 molecules is systematically reached @xcite .",
    "this behavior suggests that the characteristic length is a reasonable quantity .",
    "if a similar formula would be throwed together @xcite from gibbs , a thermodynamic compliance @xmath44 is obtained instead of a modulus ( @xmath45 in equation ( [ eq.2.2 ] ) ,    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is now calculated from the @xmath36 transformation interval corrected by freezing - in effects . using the same set of experimental data as for equation ( [ eq.2.2 ] ) @xcite , the @xmath48 values are much larger than @xmath40 from ( eq.2.2 ) @xmath7 reflecting the landau - lifshitz subsystem size [ @xcite ,   1 , 2 , 35 ] based on statistical independence as defined by the gibbs distribution ( or static correlation functions ) @xmath7 and do not show a systematic increase with falling temperature .",
    "this behavior suggests that the construct ( [ eq.2.3 ] ) is not a reasonable quantity .      today",
    ", the majority of thermodynamic colleagues does not believe in equation ( [ eq.2.2 ] ) . to prove unambiguously the existence of such an entity",
    ", we need another experiment that uses a definite , continuously varying length testing the glass transition zone ( @xmath36 ) at different temperatures @xmath13 and frequencies @xmath49 , e.g. a wave vector @xmath50/length , and which length can be compared with the characteristic length from thermodynamics .",
    "static xray or neutron scattering is not suitable , because the appropriate contrast in pure liquids is too low .  more suitable is e.g. the dynamic neutron scattering ( dns ) in partly deuterated , otherwise pure liquids .",
    "but today , a direct comparison with e.g. dynamic calorimetry ( dc ) is not possible because there is a frequency gap @xcite between the former ( @xmath51 mz ) and the latter ( @xmath52 mz ) method .",
    "according to an judgement of leading people in dns , e.g. dieter richter @xcite , and in dc , e.g. christoph schick @xcite , the gap can be closed in some years , in 2012 , say .",
    "if the lengths obtained from the two methods would be consistent ( and well outside the gibbs formula ) , then this experimentum crucis would be positive for the new entity .",
    "a @xmath53 plot could be used for the comparison .",
    "the relevant ( diffusion , relaxation ) part of the dynamic intermediate scattering function gives a levy extended - exponential time @xmath54 @xcite that can be transferred ( via the levy exponent @xmath18 @xcite ) in a frequency @xmath55 . from this",
    ", a raster @xcite of dns isotherms in the above plot can be constructed .",
    "the ( @xmath56 ) points from dc can be put in this raster , and the lengths from dns-@xmath57 values on the abscissa , say , can directly compared with characteristic lengths from dc . it remains to check the minor uncertainty , how density and entropy responses can be compared .",
    "let us explain the concept of _ shaping power of levy distribution _ in more detail than above . consider a common space in two dimensions",
    ": the @xmath58 axis be the natural space across the @xmath0 defect and the @xmath49 axis be the frequency axis of the event space of probability . after a common scaling ( shorter modes are quicker , i.e. have a higher probability ) ,",
    "the center @xmath59 is the middle of the defect with the larger frequency @xmath49 values (  @xmath60  ) and the periphery is the borderline region to the neighbor defect with the lower @xmath49 values . center and periphery of the @xmath0 defect substitute thermodynamically a cooperatively rearranging region @xcite , an entity with low density contrast . in the common space ,",
    "the particular properties of the levy distribution are differently located .",
    "this is called shaping power . the preponderant component @xcite with an influence of order of the tilt ( @xmath61 ) on the whole levy sum of random variables , and the upper , fractal hierarchy @xcite of this ordered sum ( by @xmath62 ) are located at the center ; while the damping factor @xmath26 of the  lower hierarchy  ( large @xmath62 ) is arranged near the periphery in the entities where the sum breaks down by diving below the neighbor defect . in other words ,",
    "irrespective of the low  static ",
    "density contrast , the borderline between the entities is defined by the mutual disturbation of the differently centered ( in space ) shaping powers of neighboring @xmath0 defects ; the borderlines define the characteristic volume ( [ eq.2.2 ] ) . since the gauss distribution ( @xmath63 ) has no particular properties such as hierarchy etc .",
    ", a shaping power can not be defined for gauss and gibbs : the shaping power is for the dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "the levy distribution density @xmath64 is thus realized by a spectral density @xmath65 in the measure @xmath66 with @xmath67 .  for large frequency at the @xmath0 defect center",
    "we find fractality ,    @xmath68    the center is then connected with the local break through of the mobility ( levy instability ) .",
    "the preponderant component corresponds to the diffusion step of the molecule through a cage door of neighbor molecules in the center .",
    "as known from probability theory @xcite , for @xmath24 the levy exponent @xmath18 is often the only important parameter of the limit distribution .",
    "theoretically , the levy exponent @xmath18 must be realized during a renormalizing limit process of the sum , @xmath69 .",
    "the levy exponent @xmath18 depends on a plurality index @xmath70 that depends for a given defect on the kind of disturbance / response , on temperature , and pressure .",
    "the reason for plurality is that the numbers @xmath62 for the levy sum of a @xmath0 defect are not so large as e.g. the huge number of filter elements for the renormalization of charge and mass of elementary particles , where a pure huge - number approximation seems to be a reasonable approach ( cf .",
    "this part , sections 5.2 and 5.3 there ) .    as a consequence of this picture ,",
    "the local diffusion is determined by the fractality , as observed by dns @xcite .",
    "a sublinear _ levy diffusion _ is obtained as    @xmath71    having the cauchy limit @xmath72 for _ normal diffusion _ , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 being the relevant length )",
    ".    remark .",
    "very general reasons are necessary to apply the above shaping - power scenario to a cosmological initial liquid .",
    "the representativeness theorem @xcite shows that the levy dynamic heterogeneity of the dynamic glass transition ( @xmath36 ) can even be derived from arguments of classical thermodynamics alone .",
    "this theorem says that the dynamic compliances have levy - distributed times with a levy exponent @xmath75 , whereas the corresponding  static  spatial correlations have a gauss distribution ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "roughly : the levy distribution follows from a general limit theorem of probability theory ( excluding others than gauss and levy , cf .",
    "feller in @xcite ) , since fluctuation ( variance ) and expectation is infinite due to the levy instability in the cage .",
    "this is a new entity , thermodynamically a minimal representative with one @xmath0 defect ( representative for the whole system , cf .",
    "the equation ( [ eq.2.2 ] ) arguments ) ; the infinities follow from the negative pressure inside , especially @xmath75 follows from the infinitive expectation of the diffusion step . since the probability density of classical systems is symmetric",
    ", the characteristic function is proportional to @xmath77 leading directly to the experimental kohlrausch function .",
    "the use of compliance ( instead of a modulus ) follows from the relation to the additivity of the ordered levy sum via the fdt as measuring equation .",
    "one of the greatest surprise in classical glass transition research was the discovery that the debye bche inhomogeneities in frozen glasses debye correspond to a slow dispersion zone",
    ". these  fischer modes  @xmath78 have relaxation times e.g. 10@xmath79 times longer and mode lengths e.g. 50 times larger than those of the dynamic glass transition ( @xmath36 ) fischer , patkowski .",
    "the corresponding fischer speckles contain , according to the length ratio @xmath80 , a large number @xmath81 of @xmath0 defects .",
    "the origin of such large numbers is the next task .",
    "we assume @xmath7 against wild structural speculations in the literature , e.g. fischer clusters @xmath7 that the fischer modes are a direct consequence of the dynamic glass transition @xmath36 without any structural input @xcite .",
    "then we have to look for a physical @xmath0 defect process that eats its way through large space @xmath74 and time @xmath82 ranges : a levy diffusion process equation ( [ eq.3.2 ] ) .",
    "we expect , therefore , that the tilt ( @xmath61 ) with the levy exponent @xmath18 defines the large number @xmath81 ( figure 1 ) .     process length ( @xmath83 ) and time ( @xmath84 ) in a diffusion plot , log@xmath82 vs @xmath85 , using the relevant tilt ( @xmath61 ) for the glarum levy defects ( @xmath0 defects ) of the main transition ( @xmath36 ) . forward = levy ( @xmath86 ) , backward = normal ( @xmath87 ) , cf .",
    "figure 2 below .",

    "the @xmath0 defects have a large density , in classical liquids ( @xmath88 ) from equation ( [ eq.2.2 ] ) of order @xmath89nm@xmath90 .",
    "the molecular diffusion is therefore step by step with short times @xmath91 and short lengths @xmath92 , from one @xmath0 defect to the next neighboring one along a diffusion line ( figure 2a ) .",
    "we find therefore the levy diffusion ( [ eq.3.2 ] ) as observed @xcite , along to full distances of the @xmath1 speckles by  analytic continuation  with the sublinear slope .    ) and backward ( @xmath93 ) probes .",
    "details see text .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    backward , how probes the slow @xmath78 process the fast @xmath0 defect process ? in the large @xmath78 time order @xmath84 , the fast dynamics of the small @xmath36 subsystems are mutually statistically independent ( for @xmath94 ) .",
    "the many @xmath36 subsystems allow a quasi thermodynamic treatment .",
    "the thermodynamic variables @xmath95 have a finite variance .",
    "the relaxation can then be described by @xmath96 const @xmath97 , with a positive constant .",
    "this gives the exponential decay leading via a cauchy law ( @xmath72 ) to normal diffusion in equation ( eq.3.2 ) .",
    "consequently , we find the space and time scales for the @xmath1 speckles ( @xmath98 ) at the upper ( @xmath78 ) corner of the triangle in figure 1 : the levy diffusion , to be effective , must be faster than the normal diffusion . in larger scales , beyond the @xmath78 corner ,",
    "the construction is exhausted , which means that the @xmath1 speckle defines a largest causal region in the classical liquid .    to get a formula , we start from the triangle basis @xmath99 .",
    "this is the logarithmus - of - time difference between the normal and levy diffusion at the @xmath0 defect length scale @xmath92 .",
    "the levy diffusion is at high  fractal  frequencies near the @xmath0 defect center at the cage door , i.e. at some @xmath100 in the short - time tail of the @xmath36 process . the normal diffusion , however , is near an average of time ( in logarithmic measure ) , @xmath101 :    @xmath102    i.e. @xmath99 is of the order @xmath103 , the width of the response function on the @xmath104 axis ( figure 3.7b of @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that the length and time ratios ( @xmath80 ) are mainly determined by the levy exponent tilt of the @xmath0 defect dynamics , ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "using @xmath105 , we get the slope difference ( forward minus backward ) as ( @xmath106 and the ratios as    @xmath107    both ratios tend to infinity for vanishing tilt , @xmath108 ( or @xmath109 , cauchy ) .",
    "large ratios can therefore easily be obtained for small tilts , also such ones as observed in the classical liquids @xcite .",
    "example . the number @xmath81 of @xmath0 defects",
    "as claimed by the fischer speckles as largest causal region in @xmath110 dimensions is    @xmath111    for \\{@xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 } we get @xmath115 ; this @xmath115 value can also be obtained e.g. for @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and so on .    for cosmological applications ( section 6 ) , we should discuss the relation of the @xmath0 defect tilt ( @xmath61 ) to the scalar index tilt ( @xmath22 ) from the power law fit of the density fluctuation spectrum .",
    "it seems useful , however , first to devote the next sections 4 and 5 to gravitation and inflation of our model .",
    "our model  does not have an eigensolution for gravitons .",
    "if the graviton is some type of charge ( gravitation as a charge is discussed by feynman feynman ) , and if a charge is characterized by at least one @xmath119 torus in the model , then an extra torus beyond the eigensolutions must be constructed : a circle @xmath119 from four @xmath120 segments of @xmath121 may be linked by four random connections called spots ( @xmath122 in figure 3 ) .",
    "the mass concentration into galaxies can give spots in the particle environment , if the culminating - point filter construction from large to small filter elements is considered as some map of the universe in the mach s principle layer of the tangent objects ( @xcite , table 2 of appendix c there ) .",
    "e.g. the central black holes of galaxies may give the randomly selected linking spots in the  dollhouse universe  around any particle ( section 7 ) .",
    "@xmath121 segments in the tangent objects of any particle .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    the number of spots is equal to the number of galaxies in the universe , @xmath123 . assuming some statistical independence in the random selection of the four spots , we get a probability for the graviton of about    @xmath124",
    "this probability may be compared with the probability of order @xmath125 to find a charge torus for the other particles participating in an interaction considered .",
    "this means that the gravitation is , for given  distances  , weaker by a factor of order 10@xmath126 than the electroweak and strong interaction .",
    "a review of our model constructions for particles ( eigensolutions [ this part , section 3 ] , for common eigensolutions [ @xcite , section 5 ] , for exchange boson construction ( @xcite , appendix c ) , and for the dollhouse universe ( section 7 , below ) seems to show that now the application of torus constructions for particles is exhausted ( table 1 ) .",
    "our model is now complete .",

    "shadow metric over the reality _ @xmath9 _  space _",
    ", if the particles or mass concentrations are widely isolated in a vacuum (  much vacuum  ) .",

    "this is not possible for cold particles in case of @xmath142 , because then smaller elements ( @xmath145 ) are not possible due to the upper limit of the hadronic region ( equation ( [ eq.5.3 ] ) , see also figure 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainty relation follows from @xmath146 assuming the possibility of existence of a particle at @xmath58 as the basic prerequisite .",
    "this _ must _ be assumed for a manifold diffeomorphism ( without @xmath143 separation ) , but this is excluded for cold particles in the too small boxes ( @xmath142 ) from our independent culminating - point particles ( with @xmath143 separation ) .",
    "let us now specify the concept of _ filter elements _ sometimes used above .",
    "since a filter is considered as some kind of a map from the hidden @xmath147 in the reality @xmath148 space , it contains things from the origin @xmath147 ( e.g. vacuum elements ) and the image @xmath148 ( metric for @xmath9 or @xmath149 tangent objects ) .",
    "our mathematical filter sets contain , therefore , a certain size variation and get some relation to a cauchy filter ( figure 1b of @xcite ) .",
    "the filter sets of vacuum elements resulting from existential instability are therefore called filter elements .",
    "the method used for our inflation scenario is the _ cutoff filter _ of figure 4 .",
    "the filter elements on the @xmath9 tangent objects for cold model hadrons ( in the vdw spinor space ) should not become smaller than the hadronic scale @xmath4 , because then the compton wave length ( as condition for their cold quantum mechanical existence ) is not available for virtual filter elements in the too small universe ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "such cold quantum mechanical particles can not exist as points there , but only as larger constructs of the model , hidden by the eigensolutions on the @xmath150 space ( @xmath151 ) , and lurking there for their convergence to particles in the reality space for @xmath152 .",
    "in other words , for @xmath5 there is no room enough to realize a cold quantum mechanical particle ( a hadron ) in the reality space ( cf . with the box discussion above ) .     and @xmath149 tangent objects . *",

    "b * ( right ) . for non - isolated dark matter particles in an @xmath149 euclidean environment , the filter is not cut and we find always positive pressure , @xmath154 . if , however , because of expansion , dark matter particles become isolated , @xmath7 i.e. if they will be imbedded in minkowski space @xmath7 then they are also to be treated by the left hand side cutoff scenario ( a ) .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    this holds also for 2-class particles ( e.g. dark matter or prebaryons ) with  internal  @xmath149 tangent objects , if they are isolated by imbedding in an  external  , sufficiently large minkowski space from @xmath9 tangent objects of the other particles or other participants of common culminating points .",
    "this does not hold , however , if they are not isolated , i.e. if they are living in an @xmath149 environment from tightly neighboring particles of 2-class eigensolutions , e.g. from dark matter particles . the missing time in @xmath149 does not allow to define the planck constant @xmath155 needing the seconds .",
    "then the filter is not cut ( figure 4 ) , and cold dark matter particles ( and prebaryons ) can also exist at high density for @xmath156 .",
    "dark matter particles are preferred in the small universe .    in other words ,",
    "if the cosmological expansion of a cold initial dark - matter universe crosses the hadronic length scale , @xmath6 , then many hadrons ( and hadron pairs ) are formed which were absent before in the reality - space of the universe .",
    "this is a typical situation for negative pressure , @xmath157 ( figure 4 again ) .",
    "[ remember : thermodynamically , the pressure @xmath31 is one of the variables that are necessary for maintaining the considered equilibrium state . for representative subsystems with length @xmath139 , here for @xmath158 , this pressure @xmath31 would be the  external  pressure .",
    "there is a widespread misunderstanding , that negative pressure can be defined by radially escaping particle trajectories .",
    "such behavior would also be typical for positive external pressures @xmath159 with @xmath160 .",

    "is called _ hadronic inflation_. if this is connected with a  hadronic cosmological constant  , suitably compared to gravitation , we would get the factor 10@xmath162 of equation ( [ eq.4.1 ] ) .",

    "it is finally the shaping power of the levy distribution that forms the galaxies of the universe and allows a relation between their number @xmath81 and the tilt ( @xmath22 ) in the density fluctuation .",
    "@xmath239 would mean no tilt and no gravitation .",
    "the decrease of the filter element size during forming the culminating points corresponds to a map of the universe in the @xmath9 tangent objects near culminating point particles . in this dollhouse universe",
    "are , in accordance with mach s principle , the galaxies mapped to small spots that are used to construct gravitons as charges from four hidden @xmath121 segments randomly connected by the spots .",
    "this defines gravitation , in the vacuum as a shadow metric over flat @xmath9 tangent objects as basis .",
    "the underlying flatness is based on electromagnetism , much stronger than the weakness of the shadow metric from gravitation ( factor 10@xmath126 ) .",
    "this allows a purely geometric interpretation of the cosmological parameter @xmath256 ( that was called dark energy before ) as a consequence of this flatness since the primordial stage of the universe , @xmath294 .",
    "not all reality objects are quantized so as usually assumed .",
    "the electroweak interaction remains quantized in the form that follows from feynman path integrals .",
    "dark matter , if not isolated in the vacuum of minkowski space , is not conventionally quantized ( e.g. in dense liquids ) . somewhere between these limiting cases",
    "is the quantization of strong interaction for hadrons , in particular for baryons where @xmath149 tangent objects are inside from prebaryons , and also the gravitation .",
    "although gravitons are constructed as charges , the possibility of a further general quantization of the einstein riemann metric manifold must seriously be questioned .  dark energy  as geometrical flatness",
    "does not allow any quantization .",
    "some conventional priors important for cosmology are substituted by the model as follows : there are no higgs particles because corresponding eigensolutions are missing ; the filter elements are not independent fields and can not be quantized because they do not fluctuate due to their huge numbers .",
    "a hot big bang is not necessary , because cold dark matter particles remain points also at large densities in the initial liquid for they can not be quantized in the euclidean @xmath149 tangent objects there .",
    "the cosmological parameter @xmath176 needs not to be an dark energy , because it can be reduced to spatial flatness .",
    "@xmath7 in the frame of our hidden charge model , a search for higgs particles or independent dark energy is not useful .",
    "the above part of the paper corresponds to arxiv 0901.1050 v2 [ physics.gen-ph ] 20 jan 2009 , apart from twenty - two short adaptions and six corrections of mistakes .",
    "it seems useful to explain how this paradigmatic result was obtained .",
    "i used a neural network method without computer .",
    "the author motivated systematically , since 1964 , the neuron structure in his own head to find possibly new paradigmatic ideas in astroparticle physics .",
    "partitions into a growing number of promising `` remainders '' of the known physics in growing specific time were used as changing starting conditions . at the end",
    "there are roughly twenty remainders .",
    "the iterations of the method were organized only by internal consistencies : completely _ inside _ the paradigm , i.e. consistencies with all foregoing internal consistencies : between the changing remainders , between their binary relations , and the many new relations between foregoing consistencies .",
    "most of these internal iterations were documented by the author ( all in german ) : the first with number 1 is of 4 may 1964 ( physical point and its environment ) , the last with number 1381 is of 19 oct 2003 ( @xmath295 torus for graviton ) . several hundreds of additional iterations became later implicit parts of rejected papers ( about a dozen papers ) .    two further examples .",
    "* 1*. a new spin statistic theorem ( sst ) was firstly documented with number 352 of 16 may 1970 with headline sst .",
    "its derivation from a threedimensional rotation excluded later susy ( supersymmetry ) ; see part i , sect .",
    "4.1 , table i , and eqs .",
    "( 7 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) there . * 2*. the mass operator was indicated in number 899 of 8 dec 1986 with headline pair generation , and was documented in number 948 of 9 aug 1987 with the headline : difference between charge ( coordinates @xmath296 and @xmath297 and mass ( coordinates @xmath295 and @xmath298 ) , see again part i , section 4.1 there .",
    "the mystery of the higgs particles and their connection with the flatness puzzle compensation in the universe ( m. veltmann , facts and mysteries in elementary particle physics , world scientific , new jersey 2003 , section 10 there ) gets a paradigmatic background from our application of the 90@xmath299 polar @xmath295 coordinate for both , the mass operator and the graviton torus .",
    "it turned out that the development of conventional new physics and the paradigmatic iterations diverge , i.e. they are drifting away one another , especially if the conventional ( i.e. communicable ) was organized as alternative ( @xmath300/@xmath62 ) sequence .",
    "communicable is defined by only a few ( e.g. three or less ) new concepts for understanding .",
    "an `` off - site convergence '' of the paradigmatic iterations was reached in 2008 .",
    "this convergence was defined as the event where an important phenomenon not analyzed before could be explained without introduction of any new specified idea .",
    "this was the so - called `` dark energy '' of part ii ( in section 7.2 of our paper ) .",
    "as mentioned above , roughly two thousand internal paradigmatic iterations were necessary .",
    "nevertheless , the paradigm did not become communicable and remains woolly today .",
    "the woolliness is assumed to decrease in the future .    to improve understanding",
    ", it seems useful to characterize the new paradigm by three `` basic principles a , b , c '' .",
    "this will be tried here for the example of the 1-class solution ( part i , tab .",
    "i there ) .",
    "the basic idea is a map from a hidden thing to the physical space ( a @xmath301c ) .",
    "a. : :    conformal hidden charge model ( i , section 2.2 , points ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 )    there ) . b. : :    existential instability as a consequence of the maximum for the lepton    masses ( i , fig.6 there ) .",
    "this excludes relevant particles above the    hadronic region ( ii , eq.(12 ) here ) .",
    "c. : :    electroweak feynman fabric in the physical space ( i , fig.2 there ) as a    consequence of the above a conformality .",
    "the relationship between the present new physics and an off - site converging paradigm was briefly presented in a comment ; see arxiv : 0906.2425 v2 [ physics.gen-ph ] 3 aug 2009 .",
    "this is a radical variant of a discussion in the common probability space for an alternative new physics sequence and the off - site development of a converging paradigm .",
    "sociological aspects of the hierarchies in the present large collaborations are also presented .",
    "the radical excludes any perceptible probability to find a new paradigm inside the new physics .    in reality",
    ", the relationship may be gentler . from my experience with the common probability space",
    ", i think that the probability to find a new paradigm inside a sequence of communicable new physics remains rather small .",
