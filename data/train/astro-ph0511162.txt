    "type ia supernovae ( sne ) are the most important extragalactic distance calibrators beyond a redshift of @xmath3 . since the discovery of the decline rate relation @xcite , which correlated the absolute magnitudes at maximum of type ia sne with the rates of decline , a number of methods have evolved for analyzing the optical light curves : 1 ) the  method @xcite ; 2 ) the multi - color light curve shape ( mlcs ) method @xcite ; 3 ) the stretch method , which is applied to @xmath4- , @xmath5- and @xmath6-band light curves ; and 4 ) the `` c - magic '' method of @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have also devised new uses for optical color indices of type ia sne . in this paper",
    "we shall rely on the latest version of the  method @xcite .",
    "there is a great deal of effort being expended on the discovery and follow up of high redshift sne because of the implications for a non - zero cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the observation and calibration of nearby type ia sne continues to be important . without a large sample of nearby sne covering all decline rates and",
    "light curve shapes we can not make full use of the high redshift data .",
    "another topic often swept under the rug relates to reddened sne . @xcite",
    "give r@xmath7 a@xmath8e(@xmath9 ) = 2.55  @xmath2 0.30 as the most appropriate value for a group of 20 type ia sne .",
    "@xcite find r@xmath1 = 2.65 @xmath2 0.15 from a sample of 122 type ia sne .",
    "but it is often assumed that the dust in other galaxies is exactly like the average dust in our galaxy , which has r@xmath1 = 3.1 @xcite .",
    "previously , we found that sn  1999cl must be reddened by very non - standard dust , with r@xmath10 1.8 @xcite .",
    "if standard dust parameters are assumed , sn  1999cl s host ( m  88 , in the virgo cluster ) is placed only half - way to the virgo cluster .",
    "@xcite show that the highly dimmed and reddened sn  2003cg is also affected by host galaxy dust with r@xmath10 1.8 . we know that our galaxy has dusty lines of sight that exhibit values of r@xmath1 ranging from 2.1 to 5.8 ( * ? ? ?",

    "we should not simply assume that all other galaxies have dust with r@xmath1 = 3.1 .",
    "this is the third and last paper of a series that contains optical and infrared photometry of type ia supernovae ( sne ) and which was originally presented in the lead author s ph .",
    "d. dissertation @xcite .",
    "previous papers included data on sne  1999aa , 1999cl , 1999cp , 1999da , 1999dk , 1999gp , 2000bk , and 2000ce @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report previously unpublished @xmath0 photometry of sne  1999cc and 2000cf .",
    "these two sne were the subjects of an reu project carried out by one of us ( j - lgr ) .",
    "our images of sne  1999cc and 2000cf were obtained with the 3.5-m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) in new mexico using its facility ccd camera spicam .",
    "reference images were obtained on 15 march 2004 using the 1.8-m vatican advanced technology telescope at mt .",
    "graham , arizona .",
    "we also report one @xmath11-band measurement of sn  2000cf obtained at apo using the infrared camera grim ii .    finally , we report revised @xmath0 photometry of sn  1999cl .",
    "some previously published photometry of sn  1999cl @xcite , obtained one month after maximum with the 0.9-m reflector of the university of washington s manastash ridge observatory ( mro ) required , in retrospect , the use of image subtraction templates , which were unavailable at that time .",
    "subtraction templates were obtained at apo on 10 february 2000 ut , some 243 days after the time of @xmath5-band maximum of sn  1999cl .",
    "this is sufficiently long after maximum light that the sn would have dimmed by more than 5 magnitudes .",
    "thus , systematic errors in the revised photometry resulting from the possible presence of the sn in the subtraction templates would be of order 0.01 mag @xmath12 smaller than the random errors of the photometry .",
    "additional @xmath13 photometry of these three sne is given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this photometry was obtained at the fred l. whipple observatory ( flwo ) at mt .",

    "sn  1999cc was discovered by @xcite on 8.25 may 1999 ut (= jd 2,451,306.75 ) . a spectrum reported by @xcite and obtained on 14.3 may ut revealed sn  1999cc to be a type ia sn before maximum light .",
    "this sn was located 16.8 arcsec east and 1.7 arcsec north of the nucleus of the sc galaxy ngc 6038 .",
    "the radial velocity of the galaxy , corrected to the frame of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , is 9452 .",

    "the radial velocity of the galaxy , corrected to the frame of the cosmic microwave background radiation , is 10803 .",
    "thus , both sne  1999cc and 2000cf are sufficiently distant ( @xmath14 130 mpc ) that they partake of the smooth hubble flow ( which begins at a distance of roughly 40 mpc ) .",
    "figure [ 99cc_finder ] shows the field of sn  1999cc and some nearby field stars .",
    "the coordinates of the sn and these field stars are to be found in table [ 99cccoords ] .",

    "are given in table [ 00cfcoords ] .",
    "we used a combination of software to derive the @xmath0 magnitudes of sne 1999cc and 2000cf .",
    "first , we used a package of scripts devised by brian schmidt for the alignment , kernel matching , and subtraction of the images from the reference templates .",
    "the kernel matching of the point spread functions ( psfs ) relies on the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "next , in the iraf environment we derived the mean color terms of apo s spicam from observations of landolt standards made in the spring of 1999 and 2000 .",
    "finally , we used the psf magnitudes of the sne and their respective field stars along with the known color terms to derive the standardized @xmath0 magnitudes of the sne .",
    "a similar algorithm was used to carry out image subtraction for sn  1999cl and a revision of the photometry published by @xcite .",
    "this involved , for insurance , the inclusion of artificial stars of known brightness in the data images .",
    "we also revised the photometry of some of the field stars .",
    "the stars in question are numbers 7 through 12 in table 3 of @xcite .",
    "we found that we needed to add 0.032 , 0.025 , 0.072 , and 0.062 mag to these @xmath0 magnitudes , respectively , to match the values used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these brighter stars were used for the reduction of the photometry obtained with the mro 0.9-m telescope .",
    "our mro observations were made at high airmass and with poor guiding .",
    "jha s photometry of field stars 7 through 12 is much more likely to be correct .    in tables",

    "as one can see , the internal agreement of the sn  1999cc and sn  1999cl photometry is excellent , indicating that the @xmath0 filters used at apo , mro , and flwo must have reasonably similar profiles .",
    "the sn  2000cf photometry agrees quite well in the @xmath5- and @xmath6-bands , but the @xmath15- and @xmath16-band photometry shows some systematic differences at @xmath1710 to 20 days after t(@xmath18 ) . as jha ( 2005 , private communication )",
    "points out , the mlcs code accounts for the fact that there is considerable scatter of the @xmath15- and @xmath16-band light curves at this epoch , even for unreddened objects of identical decline rate observed with only one telescope .",
    "spectroscopic corrections @xcite are required for eggregious differences in data sets comprised of photometry from different telescopes .",
    "we have only one new infrared datum to report . for sn",

    "the  light curve fitting code does not have the functionality to solve for the reddening and distance of a type ia sn suffering extremely non - standard reddening .",
    "still , with our revised photometry of sn  1999cl and the data of @xcite we may derive updated parameters of interest for this object ( see table [ 99cl_params ] ) .",
    "some parameters are quite straightforward to determine : the observed times of @xmath5- and @xmath6-band maximum light , and the @xmath5- and @xmath6-band maxima themselves .",
    "@xcite point out that the observed decline rate of a reddened type ia sn is made _ slower _ as a result of the reddening .",
    "whereas the observed decline rate of sn  1999cl is  = 1.175 @xmath2 0.075 mag , the true decline rate is roughly 1.285 @xmath2 0.080 mag . to obtain this correction we used the type ia sn spectral template of @xcite and used the reddening law of modified to be consistent with the non - standard reddening discussed below .",
    "we found that correcting the observed value of  to the true value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is sensible that the color excesses of any highly reddened star or sn increase monotonically as we increase the baseline of the two filters in question .",
    "if we consider a fictitious far - infrared photometric band `` x '' with central wavelength @xmath32 ,    @xmath33    = 0 mm    the advantage of using a combination of @xmath6-band and near - ir data is that we can scale a color excess by a coefficient not much greater than 1.0 to obtain a@xmath1 .",

    "to derive extinction from observations of sne , however , one needs to use ccm89-type coefficients derived from spectra of sne , rather than from spectra of normal stars .",
