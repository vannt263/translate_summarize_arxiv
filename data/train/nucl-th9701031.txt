    "the study of the propagation of hadrons in nuclear matter is a much studied subject .",
    "it is a tool to explore the structure of the nucleus and to probe nuclear matter at large densities .",
    "another perspective , which we adopt here , is to consider the nucleus as a known microscopic laboratory for studying elementary hadronic properties and interactions , which can then be compared to the predictions of models .",
    "this is particularly important in the case of unstable hadrons ( resonances ) , where nuclear measurements are the only means to study their interaction .",
    "even when the free elementary process is well known , experiments on a nucleus are necessary to tell us something about the space  time picture of the elementary interaction by providing a measure  typical nuclear distances and time scales . the bulk effect of the target nucleons on the propagation of the hadron is often referred to as medium modification of the particle properties , expressed through an in - medium mass and , for a resonance , also width of the hadron .",
    "the creation and propagation of resonances in nuclei has been widely studied over the last decades , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "there are two distinct ways to create a resonance in the collision of a projectile with a nuclear target . in the first",
    ", the projectile and a target nucleon form a resonance .",
    "this @xmath1-channel resonance occurs at a definite projectile energy and shows up as a peak in the energy dependence of the total cross section .",
    "an example is the excitation of nucleon resonances , in nuclear photoabsorption , where _ e.g. _ for the @xmath2 resonance the elementary process is @xmath3 .",
    "it is common to refer to this type of resonance creation as _ formation_. recent examples are the nuclear photoabsorption measurements at frascati @xcite and mainz @xcite .",
    "they showed that some nucleon resonances that were seen in photoabsorption on hydrogen and deuterium dissapear in nuclei , which to a large extent may be due to collision broadening of the resonance . in the second type , called resonance _ production _",
    ", other particles besides the resonance emerge after the initiating projectile  nucleon interaction . for example in the nuclear photoproduction of the @xmath4 resonance , the underlying mechanism is @xmath5 .",
    "there is no characteristic energy dependence in the cross section in this case and the resonance has to be identified through the invariant mass of its decay products .",
    "the production of a particular resonance in a given process continues to play a role at very high projectile energy , while _ formation _ of that resonance is suppressed as soon as one is more than a half width removed from the resonance energy .",
    "this is the reason that formation is essentially a phenomenon relevant at low resonant energies , while production is important at high energies as well .",
    "a recent experiment studying the production of the @xmath4 meson is the measurement of di - lepton spectra at the sps @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the results were interpreted through a shift of the @xmath4 mass in nuclear matter , as predicted in effective lagrangian models and in approaches based on qcd sum rules .",
    "many theoretical treatments of the behavior of resonances in nuclei were done for nuclear matter and then applied to finite nuclei by taking over the in medium propagator .",
    "a central topic of this paper is the appropriate green function for finite nuclei .",
    "the finiteness of nuclei was also a crucial ingredient in the work of ericson @xcite on the propagation of virtual pions in nuclei and our discussion has some common points .",
    "we discuss in this paper the _ coherent _ diffractive production of hadronic resonances on nuclei such as the photoproduction of vector mesons . in this case",
    "a resonance @xmath6 is produced by the initial particle @xmath7 on one of target nucleons , @xmath8 , propagates in nuclear matter interacting with other nucleons , @xmath9 , and then decays into a system of particles , @xmath10 .",
    "the decay products are registered _ outside _ the nucleus , but the decay itself can occur both inside or outside the nucleus . for simplicity , we will leave out final state interactions of the decay particles , which would be appropriate for the decay of a @xmath4 resonance into an @xmath11 pair .",
    "it will be shown that in the case of _ coherent _ production , where the nucleus returns to its ground state after the reaction , the mass distribution of decay products contains information on both stages of resonance life , in nuclear matter and in the vacuum . as a result",
    ", the mass distribution has to be interpreted not in terms of a single in medium resonance , but as an amplitude with a two  component structure .",
    "these two contributions can separately be parametrized through breit ",
    "wigner shapes .",
    "the first ( narrow ) peak corresponds to the decay outside the nucleus and is determined by the vacuum values of mass and width of the resonance .",
    "the second  typically much broader  peak is due to the interaction of the resonance with the nucleus and can be characterized through changed values of resonance mass and width .",
    "clearly , the relative contribution of the two components depends _",
    "e.g. _ on the nuclear density , the atomic number @xmath12 of the target or the life time of the resonance .",
    "the interference of these two contributions gives the mass distribution of the decay products a more complicated form and makes it harder to extract the medium modified resonance parameters from the obseved cross section .    the most common way to think about the propagation of a hadron in a nucleus originated from the intermediate energy hadron ",
    "nucleus scattering . at energies where the projectile wavelength is small compared to the characteristic sizes of the process",
    ", the range of the potential and the nuclear dimensions , the process is seen as a succession of individual elementary projectile  nucleon interactions , described by the free amplitude . in particular at higher energies the motion of the nucleons can be neglected , leading to the frozen nucleus picture as embodied in _",
    "e.g. _ the often used eikonal description .",
    "one might expect that the inherent approximations become better with increasing energy . as was pointed out by gribov @xcite,@xcite and",
    "followed up in detail by koplik and mueller @xcite , this is not the case . for a high energy projectile above a critical energy , @xmath0 , the picture changes radically",
    "the fast projectile should be seen as developing into a superposition of multiparticle hadronic states before reaching the target and before the first interaction takes place . that interaction takes place only between the lowest energy component of the projectile and the target . for an elastic scattering process",
    ", this multiparticle intermediate state eventually recombines into the original projectile ",
    "target state .",
    "this corresponds to an interaction of a considerable nonlocality , which makes the traditional approximations leading to the eikonal description incorrect .",
    "however , it was shown @xcite,@xcite that , by consistently incorporating all intermediate multiparticle states in the coherent scattering of a stable hadron from a nucleus , one surprisingly enough obtains an expression that has the same structure as the result obtained from a naive application of the eikonal approach . here",
    "we extend these ideas to the production and propagation of a resonance in a coherent production process on a nucleus , such as the electromagnetic production of vector mesons .",
    "it is clearly also relevant to the studies of dense nuclear matter through resonance production in relativistic nuclear reactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in chapter 2",
    "we discuss the production of resonances at intermediate energies , less than the critical energy , but high enough to use the eikonal approximation .",
    "we first give a simple , qualitative explanation why the production amplitude in a finite nucleus must have a two - component structure .",
    "we then derive the full expression in the eikonal approximation and show that it displays a two  component structure for the invariant mass distribution of the decay products . in ch . 3 ,",
    "the situation for energies higher than the critical value , @xmath0 , is discussed .",
    "using gribov s method we show that the final formulas turn out to have the same structure as for the eikonal approach in spite of the completely different space  time picture of the interactions in the two energy regions . in case",
    "that only one reaction channel is relevant , the propagating resonance , the formulas are identical .",
    "the reader mainly interested in the two - component structure of resonance production in finite nuclei could therefore go from ch .",
    "2 straight to ch .",
    "4 , where we give some numerical examples for the photoproduction of @xmath4 mesons on nuclei to show the relative importance of the two resonance components .",
    "the dependence on the nuclear size is studied and the influence of nuclear correlations on medium modified resonance parameters are considered .",
    "a summary and some conclusions are given in chapter 5 .",
    "a preliminary version of this work has been presented in ref .",
    "in this section we consider the coherent production of resonances on a nucleus at energies less than @xmath13 , where the interaction of the resonance with the nucleus can be described through the multiple scattering of the resonance from the target nucleons , summarized in an optical potential .",
    "the propagation of the resonance in the nuclear medium is then given by the corresponding dressed green function .    before discussing this in detail ,",
    "we first derive the relevant features of the production amplitude in a qualitative fashion for a one - dimensional example , similar to the arguments used in ref .",
    "we consider a high energy photon incident along the positive z axis with momentum @xmath14 that strikes an infinite slab of nuclear matter extending from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . inside the nuclear matter at @xmath17 a @xmath4-resonance is excited . by matching the logarithmic derivatives at @xmath16 and neglecting backward motion of the resonance , a good approximation at high energies , it is simple to see that the wavefunction of the resonance has the @xmath18 - dependence @xmath19 \\theta ( z - z_a )   +   exp [ i\\;p ( z - z_a ) ] \\theta ( z - z_a ) } \\ ; \\label{eq : wavef}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a factor depending on the excitation strength at @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that the influence of the nucleus on the resonance can be represented through a complex optical potential , @xmath21 .",
    "then @xmath22 , the momentum of the resonance inside the nuclear medium , is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the free resonance mass and width , respectively .",
    "the free resonance momentum outside the nucleus is given by @xmath26 the resonance decays at point @xmath27 into an electron - positron pair , a plane wave state of momentum @xmath28 .",
    "the production amplitude is then simply the integral over excitation and decay points , @xmath29\\over d^{\\ast } } + { \\exp[i2pd(z_a - z_i)]\\over d } \\right\\ } ~ , \\label{eq : approxt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 for large @xmath14 we have @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the total energy of the resonance .",
    "we can then write the denominators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : approxt ] ) as @xmath33 at this stage , we can already read off the relevant features .",
    "first , the amplitude is the sum of _ two _ breit - wigner resonance contributions , consisting of a term with the free and medium modified denominators , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "there is no true pole in the complex @xmath32 plane due to the in medium denominator .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that only in the limit of infinite nuclear matter , @xmath36 , where the exponential terms vanish , we are left with an amplitude that has a single , medium modified component and a pole in the complex @xmath32 plane .",
    "these are the main results we derive in this chapter .",
    "we now turn to a more detailed and complete discussion . rather than working directly within the well eikonal formalism",
    ", we briefly rederive it from a diagrammatic approach .",
    "this useful in order to better connect to the discussion in chapter 3 .",
    "we start with the amplitude for resonance production by a projectile @xmath7 with momentum @xmath14 striking a nucleus of mass @xmath12 , neglecting its further interactions with the nucleus .",
    "it corresponds to the diagram of fig.1 and the amplitude has the form @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the amplitude for resonance production on a free nucleon , @xmath39 is the propagator of the resonance and @xmath40 is the amplitude of its decay into the final state @xmath41 .",
    "the momentum transfer to the nucleus equals @xmath42 and the invariant mass of the resonance is denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that the energy is high enough that fermi motion can be neglected .",
    "therefore , we use in the amplitude @xmath44 the average total energy of the projectile and struck target nucleon , @xmath45 , where @xmath14 and @xmath46 are four - momenta of the projectile and the nucleus , respectively . in principle",
    "@xmath47 also depends on the invariant mass of the resonance , @xmath48 .",
    "the main dependence of @xmath49 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , on @xmath48 comes from the green function @xmath50 and we therefore ignore the weaker dependence in @xmath44 ; similar considerations are also applied to @xmath40 .",
    "we will only explicitly indicate the @xmath1 dependence when it is necessary to avoid confusion .    we choose the @xmath18-axis along the beam direction . for coherent production",
    "we obtain the following kinematical conditions , typical for the eikonal approximation at high energies : @xmath51 is the fourier transform of the nuclear density , @xmath52    the propagator of the resonance , @xmath53^{-1 } ~,\\ ] ] with the above kinematical approximations and neglecting the @xmath54 term , becomes @xmath55 ^{-1 } = { i\\over 2|{\\bf p}|(q_z -q_r)}~.\\ ] ] here @xmath56 are the minimal momentum transfer to produce the resonance @xmath6 and the lorentz - factor reduced width of the resonance , respectively , which we combine into the complex quantity @xmath57    we will in the following take the point of view of time ordered perturbation theory , where the intermediate propagation of the resonance occurs at fixed energy , @xmath58 determined by the initial projectile momentum .",
    "it will be most convenient to work in the coordinate representation .",
    "we therefore fourier transform with respect to the momentum variables and obtain for propagation by the distance @xmath59 with @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 this green function has the natural form for a high energy process : forward propagation of the resonance at fixed impact parameter @xmath63 with an attenuation proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "the production amplitude can be written in a way reflecting the space ",
    "time sequence of the process ( with the initial state on the right ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 eq.([eq:7 ] ) describes the resonance production on a nucleon at the point @xmath67 , its free propagation at constant impact parameter @xmath63 to the point @xmath68 and its decay at this point .",
    "the corresponding cross section has the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the phase volume for the decay @xmath71 .",
    "one can see that the distribution @xmath72 has the usual breit  wigner form as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "what happens now when we allow for interactions of the resonance with the nucleus ?",
    "one might simply expect that one again obtains a breit  wigner distribution , but now for an in medium resonance with modified parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "below , we will show that this is not the case for production of a resonance on a finite nucleus .",
    "to take into account the final state interactions of the resonance @xmath6 with the nucleus ( see fig.2 ) , we replace the free green function , @xmath75 in eq.([eq:7 ] ) by the dressed green function , @xmath76 , which takes into account the interactions with the residual nucleus .",
    "the production amplitude obtained with the full green function , @xmath76 , becomes : @xmath77 for the construction of the dressed green function in the usual multiple scattering picture , we use the elastic resonance ",
    "nucleon scattering amplitude , @xmath78 , normalized according to @xmath79 taking into account that the range of strong interactions is small compared to the nuclear size one can write approximately for the corresponding optical potential that describes the interaction with the nucleons in the nuclear ground state @xmath80 for much of the discussion below the precise form of the interaction does not matter . other effects that vary approximately as the nuclear density and can be included analogously will lead to similar conclusions .    in coordinate space the dressed green function",

    "@xmath83    it can easily be seen from eqs.([eq:15 ] ) and ( [ eq:15a ] ) that for homogeneous infinite nuclear matter with density @xmath84 , the full green function @xmath85 depends only on the difference @xmath86 .",
    "this is due to translational invariance and yields momentum conservation in the multiple scattering process .",

    "the discussion of resonance propagation in nuclei of the previous chapter can not be applied at high energies .",
    "the nonlocality of the amplitudes @xmath122 and @xmath44 must be taken into account .",
    "the interaction at high energies is dominated by intermediate multiple particle production and the amplitudes @xmath122 and @xmath44 are almost purely imaginary due to the dominance of multiparticle intermediate states . under these circumstances",
    "the description of the high energy reaction in terms of reggeon exchanges with the target becomes most natural .",
    "it was already discussed by gribov @xcite that a crucial feature of high energy interactions are the multiparticle fluctuations of the fast hadronic projectile , which are taken into account by reggeon exchange ( see fig.3 )",
    ". only the low momentum part of the fluctuation will interact with the target .",
    "two body processes , like elastic scattering or diffractive dissociation , only arise as the shadow of these multiparticle processes as required by the unitarity condition .",
    "the lifetime of the fluctuations  and thus also the nonlocality of the interaction  is proportional to the hadron energy . for the scattering of hadrons off nuclei it was shown _",
    "e.g. _ in refs.@xcite , @xcite and @xcite that there is therefore a critical energy of order @xmath123 , above which the length of the fluctuation becomes larger than the nuclear size ; here @xmath124 is the projectile mass and @xmath125 a hadronic scale parameter of the order of a few hundred mev .",
    "two effects become important above this energy",
    ". coherent production of higher mass states , @xmath126 , is not damped anymore by the nuclear form factor .",
    "secondly , the nonlocality of the the interaction of a fast hadron with a target nucleon becomes greater than the nuclear dimension , @xmath100 .",
    "this latter effect can be understood as follows . in hadron ",
    "nucleus scattering at high energies the hadron typically enters into a multiparticle state long before it enters the nucleus and reappears out of such a fluctuation only far outside the nucleus .",
    "the space  time picture of resonance production as a localized production and successive rescatterings of the resonance @xmath6 in nuclear matter , which we used in the previous chapter , is therefore not applicable anymore .",
    "it means that the sequential multiple scattering diagrams of fig.2  called _ planar _ diagrams because of the topological structure of the upper part  do not dominate anymore .",
    "note that at high energies the wavy lines denoting the interactions with the nucleon stand for the exchange of one or more reggeons ( _ i.e. _ multiparticle ladders ) .",
    "intermediate multiparticle states correspond to cuts of these ladders .    while the intermediate coupling to multiparticle states through _ sequential _ processes in finite nuclei is negligibly small at high energies , a more complicated type of coupling to the multiparticle states becomes dominant .",
    "this is the _ simultaneous _ appearance of fluctuations .",
    "an example , a _",
    "non - planar _ reggeon diagram , is shown in fig.4 .",
    "the direct calculation of the contributions from such non - planar diagrams would be extremely difficult .",
    "gribov @xcite was able to include them in his discussion of high energy scattering and showed that surprisingly the structure of the total scattering amplitude turned out to be analogous to that obtained from the eikonal multiple scattering approach used in the previous chapter .",
    "we shall only outline briefly what gribov s arguments @xcite for hadron  nucleus interactions at high energies imply for resonance production on nuclei .",
    "the derivation is based on the analytical properties of the reggeon amplitudes as a function of the complex variables corresponding to the invariant masses of intermediate states , @xmath127 .",
    "this analytic structure reflects the appearance of intermediate states and the nonlocality of the interaction .    for the coherent production of the resonance @xmath6 by a high  energy projectile @xmath7 ,",
    "we separate in the amplitude the part @xmath128 , which contains all reggeon exchange dynamics , indicated schematically in fig . 5 : @xmath129 the integrations over the @xmath17",
    "are longitudinally ordered , and the integrations over the @xmath130 are carried out from @xmath131 to @xmath132 as required by the feynman rules .",
    "the function @xmath133 , the amplitude for a diffractive @xmath134 transition through the interactions with @xmath135 target nucleons , can also be considered as a function of the variables @xmath136 .",
    "this is possible since the invariant masses @xmath136 of the @xmath137 intermediate diffractively produced states can in the eikonal limit be expressed in terms of longitudinal momentum transfers , @xmath130 , as was done in chapter 2 : @xmath138 where @xmath124 is the mass of the incident projectile @xmath7 .",
    "the important feature of the reggeon - exchange dynamics is a power - like decrease of amplitudes with increasing @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "it means that integrals over @xmath136 are convergent , and it is possible to modify integration contours in the complex @xmath136-plane by adding to them integrals over large semi - circles which are negligible .",
    "we first discuss the analytical structure of the integrand of the simplest planar diagram , fig.6a , and show that at high energies its contribution is negligibly small , as already argued above . on the positive real axis , we see in fig.6a a pole singularity , corresponding to a possible stable single - particle state .",
    "the branch point corresponds to multiparticle states , contained in the internal structure of the exchanged reggeons ( related to the nonlocality of reggeon interactions ) .",
    "the pole due to the resonance @xmath6 lies on the unphysical sheet .",
    "the presence of only right - hand - side but not left - hand - side singularities is a specific property of planar diagrams .",
    "there are also singularities due to the nuclear form factor in the @xmath136-plane .",
    "these singularities occur at @xmath139 as can be seen by assuming , for example , a form factor of the structure @xmath140 . at high energies , as @xmath141 becomes asymptotically large , they thus correspond to far away singularities , see eq.([eq:30 ] ) , and can be neglected .",
    "the nuclear formfactor singularities are not shown in the figure .    the solid line @xmath142 in fig .",
    "5a indicates the desired integral along the real axis , which we now want to rewrite . combining the contribution from the contour @xmath142 and the contribution from the upper semi - circle ( dashed ) , we obtain zero , since",
    "no singularities are enclosed by the contour . due to the behavior of the reggeon exchange amplitude for large @xmath136 ,",
    "the contribution from the semi - circle is negligible and thus the desired integral must be zero .",
    "it means that at high energies the different singularities of the planar diagram cancel each other when one takes into account all intermediate multiparticle states . at",
    "energies lower than the critical one , the nuclear form factor is crucial and prevents this cancellation by damping large - mass contributions .",

    "the most important are two  body correlations which can be be incorporated by simply multiplying the green function @xmath241 by a correlation function .",
    "this function @xmath242 is defined to be unity if correlations are absent and we assume for an estimate a simple behavior corresponding to a hard core with radius @xmath243 , @xmath244 its laplace transform is @xmath245 this yields a resonance denominator in ( [ eq:41 ] ) of the form @xmath246 where @xmath247 .",

    "the amplitude for the production of hadronic resonances on nuclear targets contains two types of components .",
    "they correspond to the propagation and decay of the resonance outside and inside nucleus .",
    "the narrow component is characterized by the free values of resonance mass and width .",
    "the broad in - medium component does not have a true pole in the invariant mass ; it has an approximate breit  wigner form with parameters depending on the nuclear density and the resonance ",
    "nucleon cross sections .",
    "both components have a different @xmath12 and energy dependence . in the limit of large @xmath12 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath253 of the broad and narrow components is proportional to the nuclear size @xmath254 .",
    "as the width of the broad component increases linearly with energy , the inside / outside ratio at a fixed invariant mass decreases as @xmath255 .",
    "thus , the most interesting region for the investigation of in - medium effects may be the region of intermediate energies , where there is only moderate damping by the nuclear form factor and the inside to outside ratio is not suppressed . as",
    "this ratio is proportional to the fraction of time the resonance spends inside the nucleus , it will be difficult to establish nuclear effects for the narrow , long lived resonances like @xmath256 .",
    "this makes it hard to extract the in - medium parameters from such experiments in a simple fashion .",
    "experiments on nuclei are an important way to study the space - time picture of elementary interactions . through the interaction with the nuclear medium one",
    "has a way of measuring the development of the reaction in units of typical nuclear length and time scales .",
    "many recent experiments concern the behavior of unstable elementary particles - resonances - in nuclei .",
    "ideally one would like to extract as directly as possible the in medium properties of the resonance , _",
    "e.g. _ the medium modified resonance parameters of mass and width .",
    "they can then be compared to models - be it on the level of quarks or hadrons - for the internal structure of the resonance and its interaction with the target nucleons . in this paper we have looked specifically at the _ production _ of resonances .",
    "examples are the production of @xmath4 or @xmath257 on nuclei . for simplicity , we left out final state interactions of the decay products in our more qualitative discussion ; this is appropriate for the decay of the above resonances into _ e.g. _ an @xmath11 pair .",
    "clearly the relevant kinematical variable for such a study is the invariant mass of the resonance , @xmath32 , which enters into the resonance amplitude and governs the resonant shape of the cross section .",
    "however , in general the connection between the incident energy , the variable at our disposal in an experiment , and the invariant mass @xmath32 of the resonance in the nucleus is not direct in a high energy collision : the nucleus will break up and different fragments will carry of part of the energy , with only a variable fraction left for the resonant state we detect in the end .",
    "however , in a _ coherent _ process , where the nucleus returns to its ground state , the nuclear formfactor restricts the momentum transfer to the target and energy and invariant mass are closely related .",
    "that is why we discussed coherent production processes only .    in a production process",
    ", the resonance can decay inside and outside of the nucleus .",
    "the relative contribution of these two possibilities depends _",
    "e.g. _ on the momentum of the resonance , the size of the nucleus and the resonance lifetime .",
    "both possibilites show up in the total amplitude : the decay outside through a component with the free resonance parameters and an additional medium - modified component for the decay inside the nucleus .",
    "the medium modifications can be described - in the simplest picture - as a shift and broadening of the resonance due to interactions with the nuclear medium .",
    "as we saw in some illustrative examples , the background contribution drops off fast with energy and we mainly see the free resonance at high energies .",
    "this is intuitively clear since the faster the resonance , the smaller its chance for an interaction with the nucleus .",
    "a similar qualitative statement also holds for the dependence on nuclear size : the importance of the medium - modified resonance is greater the larger the nucleus .",
    "thus in order to get at medium effects , it is best to stay at intermediate energies and chose a heavy nuclear target .",
    "it is legitimate to talk about the medium - modified component of the resonance in the production amplitude .",
    "however , it must be stressed that for a finite nucleus the amplitude does nt develop a pole corresponding to an in - medium state . while there is a resonance denominator of the type @xmath258 ,",
    "where @xmath259 and @xmath93 are the medium modified resonance parameters , the amplitude has no pole because , as we showed , the residue of the amplitude at @xmath260 is zero .",
    "there is only a pole in @xmath32 due to the free resonance , _",
    "i.e. _ a @xmath261 contribution with a non - vanishing residue .",
    "the reason behind this is clear : we detect the resonance through its decay products far from the target .",
    "singularities in the @xmath262-matrix can thus not be due to the interaction in a limited space ",
    "time region , as in general the s - matrix has only poles corresponding to asymptotic states .",
    "a simple illustration of this statement was shown by considering the production of the resonance in an infinite nuclear medium , @xmath263 . in that case",
    "the in - medium resonance never gets out and a true pole does develop .",
    "the above general conclusions were first derived in the standard multiple scattering formalism , the eikonal description , and our results can intuitively be understood in this picture .",
    "the statements were then shown to apply at intermediate as well as high energies . however , while the final formulas do nt change , we must at high energies radically change our space  time picture of the reaction , analogous to the findings by gribov for the scattering of a stable projectile from a nucleus .",
    "multi - component intermediate hadronic states , instead of a single hadron , propagate .",
    "these components interact _ simultaneously _ with the target , instead of sequentially as is the case at lower energies . in the diagrammatic language , the sequential multiple scattering can be represented by _",
    "planar _ diagrams .",
    "the new element entering into the description at high energies , above the critical energy , are _ non - planar _ diagrams with an entirely different singularity structure .",
    "rather than dealing with this new contribution separately , it was discussed how the consideration of planar and non - planar diagrams together , grouped in such a way that the total contributions of real intermediate states with a definite mass enter , leads to a matrix expression with a multiple scattering structure that is very similar to the amplitude at @xmath264 .",
    "this result is quite surprising given the entirely different underlying space - time picture .",
    "we have seen that in coherent production on a finite nucleus the medium - modified resonance amplitude is necessarily accompanied by a free resonance contribution , which coherently interferes with it in the expression for the cross section . in a production process , we thus can not directly measure an in - medium resonance shape .",
    "the medium - modified component plays a significant role mainly at relatively low energies and for heavy targets , where due to its interference with the free amplitude it can lead to a significant change in the overall @xmath91 dependence of the cross section .",
    "a qualitative estimate showed that nuclear correlations will only have a moderate influence on the distribution of the resonance decay products . at high energies and on lighter targets , the in - medium contribution quickly becomes a small , broad background that is difficult to identify uniquely .",
    "what we see at high energies is mainly the peak due to the free resonance , determined by the vacuum parameters . at these energies",
