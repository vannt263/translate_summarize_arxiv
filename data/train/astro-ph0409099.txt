    "the recent discovery of the gunn  peterson ( gp ) troughs in the spectra of @xmath7 quasars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , has suggested that the end of the reionization process occurs at a redshift near @xmath3 . on the other hand , the high electron scattering optical depth , @xmath8 , measured recently by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _",
    "experiment @xcite suggests that ionizing sources were abundant at a much higher redshift , @xmath5 .",
    "these data imply that the reionization process is extended and complex , and is probably driven by more than one population of ionizing sources ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the exact nature of the ionizing sources remains unknown .",
    "natural candidates to account for the onset of reionization at @xmath5 are massive , metal  free stars that form in the shallow potential wells of the first collapsed dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "the completion of reionization at @xmath3 could then be accounted for by a normal population of less massive stars that form from the metal ",
    "enriched gas in more massive dark matter halos present at @xmath3 .",
    "the most natural alternative cause for reionization is the ionizing radiation produced by gas accretion onto an early population of black holes ( `` miniquasars '' ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ionizing emissivity of the known population of quasars diminishes rapidly beyond @xmath9 , and bright quasars are unlikely to contribute significantly to the ionizing background at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , if low  luminosity , yet undetected miniquasars are present in large numbers , they could dominate the total ionizing background at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "recent work , motivated by the _ wmap _ results , has emphasized the potential significant contribution to the ionizing background at the earliest epochs ( @xmath5 ) from accretion onto the seeds of would ",

    "the soft x ",
    "rays emitted by these sources can partially ionize the igm early on @xcite .    in this contribution , we address the following issues : ( 1 ) what is the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the igm at @xmath3 ?",
    "( 2 ) can quasar black holes contribute to reionization either at @xmath3 or at @xmath5 ? ( 3 ) how did bhs grow , in a cosmological context , starting from early , stellar ",
    "mass seeds at @xmath4 ? ( 4 ) can we detect massive early ( @xmath7 ) black holes directly ?",
    "numerical statements throughout this paper assume a background cosmology with parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , consistent with the recent measurements by _ wmap _ @xcite .",
    "the ionization state of the igm at redshift @xmath15 has been a subject of intense study over the past few years .",
    "while the _ wmap _ results imply that the igm is significantly ionized out to @xmath5 , several pieces of evidence suggest that it has a high neutral fraction at @xmath16 .    one argument against a simple model , in which the igm is ionized at @xmath5 , and stays ionized thereafter , comes from the thermal history of the igm @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the igm , measured from the ly@xmath0 forest , is quite high at @xmath17 , with various groups finding values around @xmath18k @xcite .",
    "as long as the universe is reionized before @xmath19 _ and remains highly ionized thereafter _ , the igm reaches an asymptotic thermal state , determined by a competition between photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling ( the latter being due to the expansion of the universe ) . under reasonable assumptions about the ionizing spectrum ,",
    "the igm then becomes too cold at @xmath20 compared to observations @xcite .",
    "therefore , there must have been significant ( order unity ) changes in fractions of neutral hydrogen and/or helium at @xmath21 , and/or singly ionized helium at @xmath22 .",
    "an important caveat to this argument is the possible existence of an additional heating mechanism that could raise the igm temperature at @xmath17 .",
    "galactic outflows could heat the igm , in principle , but observations of close pairs of lines of sight in lens systems suggest that the igm is not turbulent on small - scales , arguing against significant stir  up of the igm by winds @xcite .",
    "the known quasar population is likely driving the reionization of helium , heii@xmath23heiii , at @xmath24 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if this process starts sufficiently early , i.e. at @xmath25 , then heii photoionization heating could explain the high igm temperature",
    ". it would be interesting to extend the search for heii patches that do not correlate with hi absorption to @xmath17 to test this hypothesis .",
    "a second argument for a large neutral fraction comes from the rapid redshift ",
    "evolution of the transmission near the redshifted ly@xmath0 wavelength in the spectra of distant quasars .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has detected large regions with no observable flux in the spectra of several z @xmath26 6 quasars @xcite .",
    "the presence of these gunn - peterson ( gp ) troughs by itself only sets a lower limit on the volume weighted hydrogen neutral fraction of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "however , this strong limit implies a rapid evolution in the ionizing background , by nearly an order of magnitude in amplitude , from @xmath28 to @xmath3 @xcite ( we note that the lyman @xmath1 region of the spectra , which is needed for this conclusion , is dismissed in another recent study @xcite , which therefore reaches different conclusions ) . known ionizing populations ( quasars and lyman break galaxies ) do not evolve this rapidly ; comparisons with numerical simulations of cosmological reionization ( e.g. @xcite ) suggests that we are , instead , witnessing the end of the reionization epoch , with the igm becoming close to fully neutral at @xmath29 . at this epoch ,",
    "when discrete hii bubbles percolate , the mean  free  path of ionizing photons can evolve very rapidly ( e.g. @xcite ) and could explain the steep evolution of the background flux .",
    "however , perhaps the strongest argument for a large neutral fraction comes from the presence of the cosmic strmgren spheres surrounding high@xmath30 quasars .",
    "if indeed the intergalactic hydrogen is largely neutral at @xmath3 , then quasars at this redshift should be surrounded by large ionized ( hii ) regions , which will strongly modify their absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown that the damping wing of absorption by neutral hydrogen outside the hii region imprints a feature that is statistically measurable in a sample of @xmath26 10 bright quasars without any additional assumptions @xcite .",
    "a single quasar spectrum suffices if the size of the strmgren sphere is constrained independently @xcite .",
    "in addition , with a modest restriction ( lower limit ) on the age of the source , the size of the hii region itself can be used to place stringent limits on the neutral fraction of the ambient igm @xcite .    ) and from outside ( @xmath31 ) the local ionized region for a typical line of sight towards a @xmath32 quasar embedded in a fully neutral , smooth igm , but surrounded by a local hii region of ( comoving ) radius @xmath33 = 44 mpc .",
    "the _ dashed curve _ corresponds to @xmath34 , and the _ solid curve _ corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "the total lyman  @xmath36optical depth is the sum of these two contributions , @xmath37 = @xmath35 + @xmath34 .",
    "the _ dashed - dotted lines _ demarcate the three wavelength regions used for our analysis described in the text . for reference ,",
    "the redshifted lyman  @xmath36wavelength is at 8852  , far to the right off the plot.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    to elaborate on these last arguments , based on the quasar s hii region , in figure  [ fig : taus ] we illustrate a model for the optical depth to lyman  @xmath36absorption as a function of wavelength towards a @xmath32 quasar , embedded in a neutral medium ( @xmath38 ) , but surrounded by a strmgren sphere  with a comoving radius of @xmath39 mpc .",
    "around bright quasars , such as those recently discovered @xcite at @xmath3 , the proper radius of such strmgren spheres is expected to be @xmath33 @xmath40 7.7 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44^{-1}$ ] mpc @xcite . here",
    "@xmath45 is the volume averaged neutral fraction of hydrogen outside the strmgren sphere and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the quasar s production rate of ionizing photons , age , and redshift .",
    "the fiducial values are those estimated for the @xmath49 quasar j1030 + 0524 @xcite . the mock spectrum shown in figure 1",
    "was created by computing the lyman  @xmath36opacity from a hydrodynamical simulation ( kindly provided by r. cen ; the analysis procedure is described in @xcite ) .",
    "the optical depth at a given observed wavelength , @xmath50 , can be written as the sum of contributions from inside ( @xmath35 ) and outside ( @xmath34 ) the strmgren sphere , @xmath51 .",
    "the residual neutral hydrogen inside the strmgren sphere  at redshift @xmath52 resonantly attenuates the quasar s flux at wavelengths around @xmath53 , where @xmath54   is the rest - frame wavelength of the lyman  @xmath36line center . as a result",
    ", @xmath35 is a fluctuating function of wavelength ( solid curve ) , reflecting the density fluctuations in the surrounding gas .",
    "in contrast , the damping wing of the absorption , @xmath34 , is a smooth function ( dashed curve ) , because its value is averaged over many density fluctuations .",
    "as the figure shows , the damping wing of the absorption from the neutral universe extends into wavelengths @xmath55  , and can add significantly to the total optical depth in this region .",
    "quasar sdss j1030 + 0524@xcite , in units of @xmath56  @xmath57 , and including uncorrelated @xmath58 errors .",
    "the upper and lower panels show the regions of the spectrum corresponding to lyman @xmath0 and @xmath1 absorption in the redshift range @xmath59 . the lyman @xmath1 cross section is smaller than lyman @xmath0 , and a significantly higher column of neutral hydrogen",
    "is required to block the flux in the lyman @xmath1 region than in the lyman @xmath0 region .",
    "this spectrum therefore requires a steep increase in the opacity over the narrow range from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , explainable only by a gp damping wing , as shown by the dashed curve in figure  [ fig : taus].,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the sharp rise in @xmath34 at wavelengths @xmath62   is a unique feature of the boundary of the hii region , and corresponds to absorption of photons redshifting into resonance outside of the strmgren sphere .",
    "the detection of this feature has been regarded as challenging : since the quasar s flux is attenuated by a factor of @xmath63 , an exceedingly large dynamical range is required in the corresponding flux measurements .",
    "however , simultaneously considering the measured absorption in two or more hydrogen lyman lines can provide the dynamical range required to detect this feature @xcite .    in particular , we modeled broad features of the lyman  @xmath36and lyman  @xmath64regions of the absorption spectrum of the @xmath49 quasar sdss j1030 + 0524 .",
    "the observational input to our analysis is the deepest available absorption spectrum of sdss j1030 + 0524   @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the spectrum exhibits a strong lyman  @xmath36gunn - peterson ( gp ) trough , with no detectable flux between wavelengths corresponding to redshifts @xmath65 , as well as a somewhat narrower lyman  @xmath64trough between @xmath66 @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] . the flux detection threshold in the lyman  @xmath36and lyman  @xmath64regions of this spectrum correspond to lyman  @xmath36optical depths of @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "respectively especially uncertain @xcite .",
    "however , we have verified that our conclusions below remain unchanged when the threshold opacities are varied well in excess of these uncertainties . in particular , considering ranges as wide as @xmath69 and @xmath70 would lead to constraints similar to those we derive below . ]    to summarize these constraints , we have divided the spectrum into three regions , shown in figure  [ fig : taus ] . in region 1 , with @xmath71 8752.5  , the detection of flux corresponds to the _ upper _ limit on the optical depth @xmath72 .",
    "region 2 , extending from 8725.8   @xmath73 8752.5  , is inside the lyman  @xmath36trough , but outside the lyman  @xmath64trough . throughout this region ,",
    "the data requires 6.3 @xmath74 .",
    "region 3 , with @xmath75 8725.8  has a _ lower _ limit @xmath76 22.8 .",
    "as defined , each of these three regions contains approximately eight pixels .",
    "we modeled @xcite the absorption spectrum , attempting to match these gross observed features .",
    "we utilized a hydrodynamical simulation that describes the density distribution surrounding the source quasar at @xmath49 .",
    "we extracted density and velocity information from 100 randomly chosen lines of sight ( loss ) through the simulation box .",
    "along each line of sight ( los ) , we computed the lyman  @xmath36absorption as a function of wavelength .",
    "the size of the ionized region ( @xmath33 ) and the fraction of neutral hydrogen outside it ( @xmath77 ) , and the quasar s ionizing luminosity , @xmath78 , were free parameters .",
    "note that changing @xmath33 moves the dashed ( @xmath34 ) curve in figure  [ fig : taus ] left and right , while changing @xmath77 moves it up and down ; changing @xmath78 moves the solid ( @xmath35 ) curve up and down .",
    "we evaluated @xmath35 and @xmath34 for each los , and for each point in a three  dimensional parameter space of @xmath33 , @xmath79 , and @xmath78 , we computed the fraction of the loss that were acceptable descriptions of the spectrum of sdss j1030 + 0524 , based on the criteria defined above .",
    "the procedure outlined above turns out to provide tight constrains on all three of our free parameters _",
    "simultaneously_. in particular , we find the allowed range for the radius of the strmgren sphere  to be 42 mpc @xmath80 47 mpc , and a @xmath81 @xmath82 lower limit on the neutral fraction of @xmath83 .",
    "these results can be interpreted as follows .",
    "as mentioned previously , the presence of flux in region 2 ( @xmath84 22.8 ) sets an immediate _ lower limit _ on @xmath33 .",
    "region 3 , however , yields an _ upper limit _ on @xmath33 , from the requirement that @xmath85 22.8 in that region .",
    "this high optical depth can not be maintained by @xmath35 alone , without violating the constraint in region 1 of @xmath84 6.3 .",
    "we note that tight constraints on the neutral fraction ( @xmath86 ) can be obtained from the size of the strmgren sphere   together with an assumed lower limit on its lifetime @xcite .",
    "our direct determination of the strmgren sphere  size is only slightly larger than the value assumed in @xcite , lending further credibility to this conclusion .",
    "our direct constraint on the neutral hydrogen fraction , @xmath77 , on the other hand , comes from the presence of flux in the lyman  @xmath64region of the spectrum corresponding to region 2 .",
    "because of fluctuations in the density field ( and hence in @xmath35 ) , a strong damping wing is needed to raise @xmath37 above 6.3 throughout region 2 , _ while still preserving _",
    "@xmath72 in region 1 .",
    "this result is derived from the observed sharpness of the boundary of the hii region alone , and relies only on the gross density fluctuation statistics from the numerical simulation . _ in particular , it does not rely on any assumption about the mechanism for the growth of the hii region . _    using a large sample of quasars ( and/or a sample of gamma  ray burst afterglows with near - ir spectra ) at @xmath7 , it will be possible to use the method presented here to locate sharp features in the absorption spectrum from intervening hii regions , not associated with the target source itself .",
    "the universe must have gone through a transition epoch when hii regions , driven into the igm by quasars and galaxies , partially percolated and filled a significant fraction of the volume .",
    "the detection of the associated sharp features in future quasar absorption spectra will provide a direct probe of the the 3d topology of ionized regions during this crucial transition epoch ( in particular , it should enhance any constraint available from either the lyman @xmath0 or @xmath1 region alone @xcite ) .",
    "the two most natural types of uv sources that could have reionized the igm are stars or accreting black holes . deciding which of these two sources dominated",
    "the ionization has been studied for over 30 years ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has become increasingly clear over the past decade that the ionizing emissivity of the known population of bright quasars diminishes rapidly beyond @xmath9 , and they are unlikely to contribute significantly to the ionizing background at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this , however , leaves open two possibilities .",
    "first , if low ",
    "luminosity , yet undetected miniquasars are present in large numbers , they could still dominate the total ionizing background at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "second , the supermassive black holes at @xmath3 must be assembled from lower ",
    "mass seeds which accrete and merge during the hierarchical growth of structure .",
    "the population of accreting seed bhs can contribute to the ionization of the igm at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    ", and the power  law index for the slope of the ionizing background , @xmath0 , based on the intensity of the present  day sxb .",
    "the quasars are assumed to form at @xmath87 and have a power  law spectrum , @xmath88 for @xmath89 ev .",
    "the curves bracket the allowed parameter space for the mean ( solid line ) or maximum ( dotted ) unaccounted flux in the sxb at @xmath261 kev .",
    "the curves shift by @xmath90 in @xmath0 if @xmath91 is assumed .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the above two possibilities can both involve faint bhs that are not individually detectable .",
    "however , a population of acceting bhs at @xmath92 would be accompanied by the presence of an early x - ray background . since the igm is optically thick to photons with energies @xmath93 below @xmath94^{0.5 } x_{\\rm hi}^{1/3}{\\hspace{1mm}}{\\rm kev}$ ] , the soft x - rays with @xmath95 would be consumed by neutral hydrogen atoms and contribute to reionization . however , the background of harder x - rays would redshift without absorption and would be observed as a present  day soft x  ray background ( sxb ) . under the hypothesis that accreting bhs are the main producers of reionizing photons in the high  redshift universe , it is a relatively straightforward exercise to calculate their contribution to the present  day sxb .",
    "we assumed for simplicity @xcite that the accreting bhs form in a sudden burst at redshift @xmath96 .",
    "the total number of bhs was expressed by a normalization constant @xmath97 , defined as the ratio of the total number of ionizing photons emitted per unit volume produced by the bh population to the number density of hydrogen atoms .",
    "full ionization of the igm at @xmath3 , where recombinations are significant , likely requires @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "we find that in order to account for the electron scattering optical depth @xmath99 by partially ( pre)ionizing the igm at @xmath5 , a somewhat smaller @xmath97 is sufficient ( see below ) .    the spectrum of the ionizing background is a crucial ingredient of the modeling , and depends on the type of accreting bh that is considered .",
    "for luminous quasars powered by supermassive black holes , we adopted a composite spectrum @xcite , based on the populations of lower redshifts ( @xmath100 ) qsos .",
    "the spectra of lower  mass miniquasars , with bhs whose masses are in the range @xmath101 @xmath102 , are likely to be harder . for these sources",
    ", we followed @xcite and adopted a two  component template that includes a multi  temperature accretion disk , and a simple power - law emission to mimic a combination of bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , and inverse compton emission by a non - thermal population of electrons .",
    "finally , we took the unresolved soft x - ray band in the energy range @xmath103 kev to be in the range @xmath104 .",
    "this range was obtained @xcite from a census of resolved x  ray sources , which we subtracted from the total sxb .",
    "we included the uncertainties in both the measurement of the total sxb ( which was dominant ) and in the number of resolved point sources .",
    "we examined a range of x  ray energies , and found the strongest constraints in the @xmath105 kev band .",
    "we note that a recent study @xcite of faint x ",
    "ray sources found a significant population of star  forming galaxies among these sources , with a steeply increasing fractional abundance ( over agns ) toward low x ",
    "ray luminosities .",
    "if this trend continues to a flux limit that is only modestly below the current point  source detection threshold in the deepest chandra fields , then the sxb would be saturated , strengthening our constraints ( leaving less room for any additional , high@xmath30 quasars ) .",
    "we find that models in which @xmath7 accreting bhs alone fully reionize the universe saturate the unresolved x ",
    "ray background at the @xmath106 level .",
    "pre - ionization by miniquasars requires fewer ionizing photons , because only a fraction of the hydrogen atoms need to be ionized , the hard x  rays can produce multiple secondary ionizations , and the clumping factor is expected to be significantly smaller than in the uv  ionization case @xcite .",
    "we find that models in which x ",
    "rays are assumed to partially ionize the igm up to @xmath107 at @xmath108 are still allowed , but could be constrained by improved future determinations of the unresolved component of the sxb .    as emphasized above",
    ", the spectral shape of the putative typical high@xmath30 accreting bh is uncertain ; the existing templates , motivated by lower ",
    "redshift sources , can be considered merely as guides .",
    "figure [ fig : xrb ] shows which combinations of @xmath0 ( the logarithmic slope of the ionizing spectrum ) and @xmath97 are allowed by the unaccounted flux in the sxb ( the solid and dotted curves cover our inferred range of the unresolved sxb ) .",
    "this figure shows that for @xmath109 , a power ",
    "law shallower than @xmath110 will saturate the unaccounted flux . for comparison",
    ", @xmath0 is in the range@xmath111 for @xmath112 , and @xmath113 for @xmath114 for optically selected radio quiet quasars @xcite .",
    "our constraints derive from the total number of ionizing photons that the population as a whole needs to produce to either fully or partially reionize the universe . therefore , our conclusions depend mostly on the assumed spectral shape and the required number of ionizing photons per hydrogen atom @xmath97 .",
    "they are independent of the details of the population , such as the luminosity function and its evolution with redshift .",
    "future improvements in resolving the sxb , improving the limits on the unresolved component by a factor of a few , would place stringent constraints on the contribution of @xmath5 accreting bhs to the scattering optical depth measured by wmap .",
    "since the seeds of early bhs may have played a role in reionization , it is all the more interesting to ask how the earliest bh population was formed , and how it evolved .",
    "the remnants of metal  free population iii stars that form in the first collapsed dark halos can serve as the initial @xmath115@xmath102seeds that later accrete and merge together , to give rise to the supermassive bhs making up the quasar population at @xmath116 , and the remnant bhs found at the centers of local galaxies .",
    "several recent studies @xcite have addressed various aspects of the evolution of the bh populations , using the underlying merger trees of dark matter halos .    recent work on the generation of gravitational waves during the coalescence of a binary black hole @xcite has suggested that the binary experiences a typical gravitational recoil velocity that may be as large as @xmath117 .",
    "these velocities exceed the escape velocity @xmath118 from typical dark matter halos at high  redshift ( @xmath92 ) , and can therefore disrupt the early stages of growth of bhs by ejecting the earliest seeds from their host galaxies .",
    "bhs can then start growing effectively only once the typical dark matter potential wells are sufficiently deep to retain the recoiling bhs .",
    "relatively little time is available for the growth of few@xmath119 smbhs prior to @xmath3 , and their seed bhs must be present as early as @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "a model in which stellar seed bhs appear in small progenitor dm halos is consistent with the presence of a @xmath121 smbh at @xmath120 , provided that each seed bh can grow at least at the eddington ",
    "limited exponential rate , and that the progenitor halos can form seed bhs sufficiently early on @xcite , in halos with velocity dispersions of @xmath122 km / s .",
    "we quantified the effect of gravitational recoil on the growth of a few @xmath119 black hole @xcite , by assuming that progenitor holes are ejected from dm halos with velocity dispersions @xmath123 , and do not contribute to the final bh mass .",
    "each halo more massive than this threshold was assumed to host a seed bh that accretes at the eddington rate , and the bhs were assumed to coalesce when their parents halos merged .",
    "we took , as an example , the smbh powering the most distant sdss quasar , sdss 1054 + 1024 at redshift @xmath124 , with an inferred bh mass of @xmath125 .",
    "we find that recoil velocities with @xmath126 must occur infrequently , or else this smbh must have had a phase during which it gained mass significantly more rapidly than an eddington  limited exponential growth rate ( with a radiative efficiency of @xmath127 ) would imply .",
    "the super  eddington growth phase can be avoided @xcite if seed bhs can form and grow by mergers in dark halos with a velocity dispersion as small as @xmath128 km / s , the halos have steep density profiles ( increasing the escape velocity @xcite from the central regions by a factor of @xmath129 relative to the naive formula @xmath130 ) , and the bhs that are retained during the mergers of their halos can grow uninterrupted at the eddington rate between their birth and @xmath131 .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether massive bhs at @xmath7 can be directly detected .",
    "while the sdss has detected a handful of exceptionally bright , few @xmath119 black holes ( the bh mass is inferred assuming these sources shine at the eddington luminosity ) , they are likely a `` tip of the iceberg '' , corresponding to the rare massive tail of the bh mass function . in x ",
    "rays bands , the deepest chandra fields have reached the sensitivity to detect nearly @xmath115 times smaller holes ( @xcite , provided they radiate the eddington luminosity , with a few percent of their emission in the x  ray bands ) .",
    "however , due to the small size of these fields , they have revealed only a handful of plausible candidates @xcite .",
    "detections however , seem promising in the large radio survey , first .",
    "we used a physically motivated semi  analytic model , based on the mass function of dark matter halos , to predict the number of radio  loud quasars as a function of redshift and luminosity @xcite .",
    "simple models , in which the central bh mass scales with the velocity dispersion of its host halo as @xmath132 have been previously found to be consistent with a number of observations , including the optical and x  ray quasar luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "we find that similar models , when augmented with an empirical prescription for the radio loudness distribution , overpredict the number of faint ( @xmath133jy ) radio sources by 12 orders of magnitude .",
    "this translates into a more stringent constraint on the low  mass end of the quasar black hole mass function than is available from the hubble and chandra deep fields .",
    "we interpret this discrepancy as evidence that black holes with masses @xmath134 are either rare or are not as radio - loud as their more massive counterparts .",
    "models that exclude bhs with masses below @xmath135 are in agreement with the deepest existing radio observations , but still produce a significant tail of high  redshift objects . in the 1 - 10ghz bands , at the sensitivity of @xmath133jy , we find surface densities of @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 deg@xmath139 for sources located at @xmath7 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "the discovery of these sources with instruments such as the _ allen telescope array ( ata ) _ , _ extended very large array ( evla ) _ , and the _ square kilometer array ( ska ) _ would open a new window for the study of supermassive bhs at high redshift .",
    "we also find surface densities of @xmath142 deg@xmath139 at @xmath143 for mjy sources that can be used to study 21 cm absorption from the epoch of reionization .",
    "these models suggest that , although not yet optically identified , the first survey may have already detected several thousand such @xmath6 bhs at @xmath7 .",

    "<S> we show new evidence , based on the combined statistics of lyman @xmath0 and @xmath1 absorption in quasar spectra , that the igm contains a significant amount of neutral hydrogen , and is experiencing rapid ionization at redshift @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we argue that quasar bhs , even faint ones that are below the detection thresholds of existing optical surveys , are unlikely to drive the evolution of the neutral fraction around this epoch , because they would over  produce the present  day soft x  ray background . on the other hand , the seeds of the @xmath3 quasar bhs likely appeared at much earlier epochs ( @xmath4 ) , and produced hard ionizing radiation by accretion . </S>",
    "<S> these early bhs are promising candidates to account for the high redshift ( @xmath5 ) ionization implied by the recent cosmic microwave anisotropy data from wmap . using a model for the growth of bhs by accretion and mergers in a hierarchical cosmology </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that the early growth of quasars must include a super - eddington growth phase , and that , although not yet optically identified , the first radio survey may have already detected several thousand @xmath6 bhs at @xmath7 . </S>"
