    "in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) superfluid , quantized vortices are topological , point - like objects and they can be created and also annihilated as a pair of vortices of opposite circulation .",
    "vortex - antivortex pairs play essential roles in 2d superfluid phenomena such as the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition  @xcite , phase transition dynamics  @xcite , and superfluid turbulence  @xcite .",
    "recently , controlled experimental studies of vortex dipole dynamics have been enabled in atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) systems  @xcite and thermal activation of vortex pairs has been observed in quasi-2d bose gases  @xcite .",
    "however , the annihilation of a vortex - antivortex pair has not been clearly observed yet .",
    "vortex pair annihilation is of particular importance in 2d superfluid turbulence . in 2d turbulence of a classical hydrodynamic fluid , the kinetic energy of the system flows toward large length scales due to the conservation of enstrophy which is integral of squared vorticity  @xcite",
    "this is known as the inverse energy cascade and manifests itself in generating large - scale flow structures from small - scale forcing .",
    "this phenomenon is qualitatively different from three - dimensional ( 3d ) turbulence where energy is typically dissipated into small length scales .",
    "an interesting question is whether the inverse cascade can occur in an atomic bec .",
    "since the enstrophy , proportional to the total number of quantized vortices in quantum turbulence , is not conserved in a compressible 2d superfluid due to the vortex - antivortex annihilation , there has been a theoretical controversy on this issue  @xcite .",

    "@xcite reported an experimental and numerical study to show that there are conditions for which 2d turbulence in a bec can dissipatively evolve into large - scale flow .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate thermal relaxation of turbulent superflow in highly oblate becs . by sweeping the center region of a trapped condensate with a repulsive optical potential ,",
    "we generate turbulent flow with a spatially disordered vortex distribution .",
    "we measure the temporal evolution of the vortex number and observe nonexponential decay behavior in the relaxation , which we attribute to the vortex pair annihilation .",
    "the vortex - antivortex collisions in the condensate are identified with crescent - shaped , coalesced vortex cores .",
    "we characterize the nonexponential decay of the vortex number with one - body and two - body decay rates , and find in our measurements that the local two - body decay rate is closely proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the temperature and @xmath2 is the chemical potential of the sample .",
    "our results on the decay rates provide quantitative information on the thermal dissipation in 2d quantum turbulence , in particualr , with finite compressibility .",

    "the trapping frequencies are @xmath7  hz . for a condensate of @xmath8 atoms , the chemical potential is @xmath9  nk and the radial thomas - fermi radius is @xmath10 m , where @xmath11 is the atomic mass . because of the large aspect ratio of the condensate , @xmath12 , the vortex line excitations are highly suppressed  @xcite and we expect that the vortex dynamics in our system is 2d .",

    "we employ a repulsive gaussian laser beam as a stirring obstacle  @xcite . having the laser beam axially penetrating through the condensate , we translate the condensate in a transverse direction by moving the magnetic trap center by 37  @xmath2 m for 30  ms ( fig .  1 ) , and adiabatically turn off the laser beam for 0.4  s. here the laser beam , fixed in the lab frame , sweeps the center region of the condensate .",
    "the gaussian beam waist is @xmath14 m and the barrier height is about 15@xmath2 .",
    "the translation speed corresponds to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the speed of sound in the center region of the condensate . with this procedure",
    ", we could generate over 60 vortices in our coldest sample without inducing noticeable shape oscillations of the condensate .",
    "the critical velocity for the vortex nucleation was measured to be @xmath17 [ fig .",
    "1(c ) ] .",
    "we detect vortices in the turbulent flow by taking an absorption image after 24  ms time - of - flight . in releasing the tapping potential , we turn off the magnetic potential 12  ms earlier than the optical potential .",
    "this was found to be helpful to improve the vortex core visibility because the axial confinement direction of the optical trap was well aligned to the imaging axis  @xcite .",
    "an image processing method is developed to facilitate measuring the number of vortices , @xmath18 , in a turbulent sample ( fig .",

    "first , we produce a blurred image by applying boxcar smoothing to an absorption image , where the box width is set to be 30  @xmath2 m , comparable to the vortex core diameter in the image . we divide the original absorption image by its blurred image and then convert it into a binary image for a certain threshold value . with this image processing ,",

    "the particles having an area size less than 15 pixels are due to image defects and ignored in our counting .        in order to validate this @xmath18 counting method , we compared its results with the results obtained from hand counting for many images and confirmed that the image processing method gives a consistent counting within less than @xmath19 ( @xmath20 vortices ) .",
    "the positions of the vortex number transition lines do not significantly affect the counting because the relative number of the particles having many vortices is small .",

    "there are only two ways for a quantum vortex to disappear from a condensate of finite spatial extent : drifting out of the condensate or being annihilated as a vortex - antivortex pair inside the condensate . since our turbulence generation method imparts no angular momentum to the condensate , the initial turbulent condensate would have equal numbers of vortices for clockwise and counterclockwise circulations , and both of the drifting - out and the pair annihilation processes must be involved in the relaxation dynamics . since the pair annihilation is intrinsically a two - vortex process , it can be a reason for the nonexponential decay of the vortex number .    to examine the details of the decay behavior of @xmath18 , we determine the decay rate @xmath22 from the measured @xmath18 data and fig .",
