    "energy harvesting is a promising solution to increase the life cycle of wireless nodes and hence alleviates the energy bottleneck of green wireless networks . as an alternative to conventional energy harvesting techniques ,",
    "simultaneous wireless information and power transfer  ( swipt ) , which relies on the usage of radio frequency ( rf ) signals , is expected to bring some fundamental changes to the design of wireless communication networks  @xcite . considering that a wireless relay is not always convenient to be equipped with fixed power supplies ,",
    "the energy harvesting relay with swipt has been presented recently , where power splitting ( ps ) and time switching ( ts ) are two advanced protocols  @xcite .",
    "ps splits the received signal power at the relay into two parts , one is for information processing , and the other is for energy harvesting to power the forwarding of the processed information . while the relay utilizes different time blocks to realize these two operations separately in the ts protocol .",
    "further on , thanks to the spatial processing in wireless nodes with multiple antennas , the ts protocol has been extended and the information processing and energy harvesting can be separated at different antennas over the same time , and antennas switch between decoding and rectifying based on a antenna selection ( as ) scheme  @xcite .    intuitively , in the multiple - antenna scenario , the joint ps and as design can reach a flexible utilization of the received rf signals , which provides better performances than the separated ps or as does . through",
    "as , partial antennas are selected out only for energy harvesting , and the remaining antennas are specified for both information processing and energy harvesting , which can be optimized further by ps . unfortunately , few works have discussed the joint ps and as design for the relay with multiple antennas . in this letter",
    ", a  harvest - and - forward \" strategy is proposed to improve the achievable rate in energy harvesting relay channels with multiple antenna configurations .",
    "further , the achievable rate maximization problem through the joint as and ps optimization is formulated and derived .",
    "an energy harvesting relay channel consisting of a single - antenna source @xmath0 , a single - antenna destination @xmath1 , and a multiple - antenna relay @xmath2 , is depicted in fig . [ fig1](a ) .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are devices without energy harvesting and have continuous supply of power .",
    "@xmath2 is an energy harvesting device and relies on its harvested energy to participate in signal transmission and processing . to complete the information delivering from @xmath0 to @xmath1 with the help of @xmath2 , a two - phase  harvest - and - forward \" strategy is presented in this letter",
    "specifically , in the first phase , @xmath2 receives a signal from @xmath0 , and harvests energy from a part of its signal power . in the second phase ,",
    "relying on the harvested energy , @xmath2 amplifies and forwards remnant signals to @xmath1 . for simplicity ,",
    "the transmission duration of each phase is set to be normalized , thus the terms  energy \" and  power \" can be used equivalently  @xcite .",
    "besides , the power consumption for the signal receiving is assumed to be negligible , and the harvested energy at @xmath2 is only used for signal forwarding  @xcite .    in the first phase , the received signal at @xmath2 with @xmath3 antennas can be denoted by @xmath4 where @xmath5^t}$ ] is an @xmath6 vector , @xmath7 denotes the transmitted signal from @xmath0 with normalized power @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the transmit power at @xmath0 with @xmath10 . besides , @xmath11^t}$ ] denotes the @xmath6 channel vector between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and",
    "@xmath12 is the @xmath6 additive noise vector introduced by the receiver antennas at @xmath2  @xcite .    for the realization of the harvest - and - forward strategy ,",
    "@xmath3 antennas are divided into two sets via the as technique , thus the received signal @xmath13 is split into two sub - signals ( i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the components in the first antenna set are used to forward signals and harvest energy via the ps technique .",
    "the ratio of sub - signal power split for the information processing is denoted as @xmath16 $ ] , and the energy harvesting is denoted as @xmath17 .",
    "the components in the second antenna set are used to harvest energy solely .",

    "what s more , @xmath27 is limited , since @xmath28 .    during the second phase",
    ", the remnant signals will be amplified and forwarded to @xmath1 , which is powered by the harvested energy in the first phase .",
    "note that a distributed beamforming design is adopted at @xmath2 as in  @xcite , since the joint optimization of a centralized beamforming , ps and as is too complex to achieve a tractable solution . in this way",
    ", we only focus on the joint optimization of ps and as in this letter .",

    "the harvested energy allocation is based on the strength of remnant signals at each antenna .",

    "accordingly , the received signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) at @xmath1 can be given by @xmath50    consequently , an optimization problem is formulated for the proposed harvest - and - forward strategy to maximize the achievable rate : @xmath51 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the channel bandwidth , @xmath53 are variables determined by the as scheme , and @xmath26 is the variable determined by the ps scheme .",

    "a greedy antenna selection scheme is presented to approach the optimal solution , which is of a complexity of @xmath71 , and thus easier to handle .",
